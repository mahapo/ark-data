I was sitting bythe ocean one late summer afternoon, watching the wavesrolling in and feeling the rhythm of my breathing, when Isuddenly became aware of my whole environment as beingengaged in a gigantic cosmic dance. Being a physicist, I knewthat the sand, rocks, water and air around me were made ofvibrating molecules and atoms, and that these consisted ofparticles which interacted with one another by creating anddestroying other particles. I knew also that the Earth’s atmo-sphere was continually bombarded by showers of ‘cosmic rays’,particles of high energy undergoing multiple collisions as theypenetrated the air. All this was familiar to me from my researchin high-energy physics, but until that moment I had onlyexperienced it through graphs, diagrams and mathematicaltheories. As I sat on that beach my former experiences came tolife; I ‘saw’ cascades of energy coming down from outer space,in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmicpulses; I ‘saw’ the atoms of the elements and those of my bodyparticipating in this cosmic dance of energy; I felt its rhythmand I ‘heard’ its sound, and at that moment I knew that thiswas the Dance of Shiva, the Lord of Dancers worshipped bythe Hindus.I had gone through a long training in theoretical physicsand had done several years of research. At the same time, Ihad become very interested in Eastern mysticism and hadbegun to see the parallels to modern physics. I was particularlyattracted to the puzzling aspects of Zen which reminded meof the puzzles in quantum theory.

To overcome theThegap between rational, analytical thinking and the meditativeTao ofexperience of mystical truth, was, and still is, very difficult forPhysicsme.In the beginning, I was helped on my way by ‘power plants’which showed me how the mind can flow freely; how spiritualinsights come on their own, without any effort, emerging fromthedepth of consciousness. I rememberthefirst such experience.Coming, as it did, after years of detailed analytical thinking, itwas so overwhelming that I burst into tears, at the same time,not unlike Castaneda, pouring out my impressions on to apiece of paper.Later came the experience of the Dance of Shiva which Ihave tried to capture in the photomontage shown on page 224.It was followed by many similar experiences which helped megradually to realize that a consistent view of the world isbeginning to emerge from modern physics which is harmoniouswith ancient Eastern wisdom. I took many notes over the years,and wrote a few articles about the parallels I kept discovering,until I finally summarized my experiences in the present book.This book is intended for the general reader with an interestin Eastern mysticism who need not necessarily know anythingabout physics. I have tried to present the main concepts andtheories of modern physics without any mathematics and innon-technical language, although a few paragraphs may stillappear difficult to the layperson at first reading. The technicalterms I had to introduce are all defined where they appearfor the first time and are listed in the index at the end of thebook.I also hope to find among my readers many physicists withan interest in the philosophical aspects of physics, who haveas yet not come in contact with the religious philosophies ofthe East. They will find that Eastern mysticism provides aconsistent and beautiful philosophical framework which canaccommodate our most advanced theories of the physicalworld.As far as the contents of the book are concerned, the readermay feel a certain lack of balance between the presentation ofscientific and mystical thought.

It has become the basis of naturalscience, and the combination of natural and technical sciencehas fundamentally changed the conditions of life on our earth,both in beneficial and detrimental ways. Today, there is hardlyan industry that does not make use of the results of atomicphysics, and the influence these have had on the politicalstructure of the world through their application to atomicweaponry is well known. However, the influence of modernphysics goes beyond technology. It extends to the realm ofthought and culture where it has led to a deep revision inman’s conception of the universe and his relation to it. Theexploration of the atomic and subatomic world in the twentiethcentury has revealed an unsuspected limitation of classicalideas, and has necessitated a radical revision of many of ourbasic concepts. The concept of matter in subatomic physics,for example, is totally different from the traditional idea of amaterial substance in classical physics. The same is true forconcepts like space, time, or cause and effect. These concepts,however, are fundamental to our outlook on the world aroundus and with their radical transformation our whole world viewhas begun to change.These changes, brought about by modern physics, havebeen widely discussed by physicists and by philosphers overthe past decades, but very seldom has it been realized thatthey all seem to lead in the same direction, towards a view ofthe world which is very similar to the views held in Easternmysticism. The concepts of modern physics often show sur-prising parallels to the ideas expressed in the religious philo-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18sophies of the Far East. Although these parallels have not, asTheyet, been discussed extensively, they have been noticed byTao ofsome of the great physicists of our century when they came inPhysicscontact with Far Eastern culture during their lecture tours toIndia, China and Japan.

Here the parallels between"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"modern physics and Eastern mysticism are most striking, andwe shall often encounter statements where it is almost im-possible to say whether they have been made by physicistsor by Eastern mystics.When I refer to ‘Eastern mysticism’, I mean the religiousphilosophies of Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism. Althoughthese comprise a vast number of subtly interwoven spiritualdisciplines and philosophical systems, the basic features oftheir world view are the same. This view is not limited to theEast, but can be found to some degree in all mystically orientedphilosophies. The argument of this book could therefore bephrased more generally, by saying that modern physics leadsus to a view of the world which is very similar to the viewsheld by mystics of all ages and traditions. Mystical traditionsare present in all religions, and mystical elements can be foundin many schools of Western philosophy. The parallels to modernphysics appear not only in the Vedas of Hinduism, in the IU-ring, or in the Buddhist sutras, but also in the fragments ofHeraclitus, in the Sufism of Ibn Arabi, or in the teachings ofthe Yaqui sorcerer Don Juan. The difference between Easternand Western mysticism is that mystical schools have alwaysplayed a marginal role in the West, whereas they constitutethe mainstream of Eastern philosophical and religious thought.I shall therefore, for the sake of simplicity, talk about the‘Eastern world view’ and shall only occasionally mention othersources of mystical thought.If physics leads us today to a world view which is essentiallymystical, it returns, in a way, to its beginning, 2,500 years ago.It is interesting to follow the evolution of Western sciencealong its spiral path, starting from the mystical philosophies ofthe early Greeks, rising and unfolding in an impressive develop-ment of intellectual thought that increasingly turned awayfrom its mystical origins to develop a world view which is insharp contrast to that of the Far East. In its most recent stages,Western science is finally overcoming this view and comingback to those of the early Creek and the Eastern philosophies.This time, however, it is not only based on intuition, but alsoon experiments of great precision and sophistication, and ona rigorous and consistent mathematical formalism.19ModernPhysics"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20The roots of physics, as of all Western science, are to beThefound in the first period of Greek philosophy in the sixthTao ofcentury B.C., in a culture where science, philosophy andPhysicsreligion were not separated. The sages of the Milesian schoolin lonia were not concerned with such distinctions. Their aimwas to discover the essential nature, or real constitution, ofthings which they called ‘physis’. The term ‘physics’ is derivedfrom this Greek word and meant therefore, originally, theendeavour of seeing the essential nature of all things.This, of course, is also the central aim of all mystics, and thephilosophy of the Milesian school did indeed have a strongmystical flavour. The Milesians were called ‘hylozoists’, or‘those who think matter is alive’, by the later Greeks, becausethey saw no distinction between animate and inanimate, spiritand matter. In fact, they did not even have a word for matter,since they saw all forms of existence as manifestations of the‘physis’, endowed with life and spirituality. Thus Thales declaredall things to be full of gods and Anaximander saw the universeas a kind of organism which was supported by ‘pneuma’, thecosmic breath, in the same way as the human body is supportedby air.The monistic and organic view of the Milesians was veryclose to that of ancient Indian and Chinese philosophy, andthe parallels to Eastern thought are even stronger in thephilosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus. Heraclitus believed in aworld of perpetual change, of eternal ‘Becoming’. For him, allstatic Being was based on deception and his universal principlewas fire, a symbol for the continuous flow and change of allthings. Heraclitus taught that all changes in the world arisefrom the dynamic and cyclic interplay of opposites and hesaw any pair of opposites as a unity. This unity, which containsand transcends all opposing forces, he called the Logos.The split of this unity began with the Eleatic school, whichassumed a Divine Principle standing above all gods and men.This principle was first identified with the unity of the universe,but was later seen as an intelligent and personal God who standsabove the world and directs it. Thus began a trend of thoughtwhich led, ultimately, to the separation of spirit and matterand to a dualism which became characteristic of Westernphilosophy."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"A drastic step in this direction was taken by Parmenides ofElea who was in strong opposition to Hera&us. He called hisbasic principle the Being and held that it was unique and in-variable. He considered change to be impossible and regardedthe changes we seem to perceive. in the world as mere illusionsof the senses. The concept of an indestructible substance asthe subject of varying properties grew out of this philosophyand became one of the fundamental concepts of Westernthought.In the fifth century B.C., the Greek philosophers tried toovercome the sharp contrast between the views of Parmenidesand Heraclitus. In order to reconcile the idea of unchangeableBeing (of Parmenides) with that of eternal Becoming (of Hera-clitus), they assumed that the Being is manifest in certaininvariable substances, the mixture and separation of whichgives rise to the changes in the world. This led to the conceptof the atom, the smallest indivisible unit of matter, whichfound its clearest expression in the philosophy of Leucrppusand Democritus. The Greek atomists drew a clear line betweenspirit and matter, picturing matter as being made of several‘basic building blocks’. These were purely passive and in-trinsically dead particles moving in the void. The cause oftheir motion was not explained, but was often associated withexternal forces which were assumed to be of spiritual originand fundamentally different from matter. In subsequentcenturies, this image became an essential element of Westernthought, of the dualism between mind and matter, betweenbody and soul.As the idea of a division between spirit and matter tookhold, the philosophers turned their attention to the spiritualworld, rather than the material, to the human soul and theproblems of ethics. These questions were to occupy Westernthought for more than two thousand years after the culmina-tion of Greek science and culture in the fifth and fourth centuriesB.C. The scientific knowledge of antiquity was systematizedand organized by Aristotle, who created the scheme whichwas to be the basis of the Western view of the universe fortwo thousand years. But Aristotle himself believed that questionsconcerning the human soul and the contemplation of Cod’sperfection were much more valuable than investigations of21ModernPhysics"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"22the material world. The reason the Aristotelian model of theTheuniverse remained unchallenged for so long was precisely thisTao oflack of interest in the material world, and the strong hold ofPhysicsthe Christian Church which supported Aristotle’s doctrinesthroughout the Middle Ages.Further development of Western science had to wait untilthe Renaissance, when men began to free themselves fromthe influence of Aristotle and the Church and showed a newinterest in nature. In the late fifteenth century, the study ofnature was approached, for the first time, in a truly scientificspirit and experiments were undertaken to test speculativeideas. As this development was paralleled by a growing interestin mathematics, it finally led to the formulation of properscientific theories, based on experiment and expressed inmathematical language. Galileo was the first to combineempirical knowledge with mathematics and is therefore seenas the father of modern science.The birth of modern science was preceded and accompaniedby a development of philosophical thought which led to anextreme formulation of the spirit/matter dualism. This formula-tion appeared in the seventeenth century in the philosophyof Rene Descartes who based his view of nature on a funda-mental division into two separate and independent realms;that of mind (res cogitans), and that of matter (res extensa).The ‘Cartesian’ division allowed scientists to treat matter asdead and completely separate from themselves, and to seethe material world as a multitude of different objects assembledinto a huge machine. Such a mechanistic world view was heldby Isaac Newton who constructed his mechanics on its basisand made it the foundation of classical physics. From the secondhalf of the seventeenth to the end of the nineteenth century,the mechanistic Newtonian model of the universe dominatedall scientific thought. It was paralleled by the image of amonarchical Cod who ruled the world from above by imposinghis divine law on it. The fundamental laws of nature searchedfor by the scientists were thus seen as the laws of God, in-variable and eternal, to which the world was subjected.The philosophy of Descartes was not only important for thedevelopment of classical physics, but also had a tremendous"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"influence on the general Western way of thinking up to thepresent day. Descartes’ famous sentence ‘Cogito ergo sum’-‘I think, therefore I exist’-has led Western man to equate hisidentity with his mind, instead of with his whole organism. Asa consequence of the Cartesian division, most individuals areaware of themselves as isolated egos existing ‘inside’ theirbodies. The mind has been separated from the body and giventhe futile task of controlling it, thus causing an apparent con-flict between the conscious will and the involuntary instincts.Each individual has been split up further into a large numberof separate compartments, according to his or her activities,talents, feelings, beliefs, etc.,which are engaged in endlessconflicts generating continuous metaphysical confusion andfrustration.This inner fragmentation of man mirrors his view of theworld ‘outside’ which is seen as a multitude of separate objectsand events. The natural environment is treated as if it consistedof separate parts to be exploited by different interest groups.The fragmented view is further extended to society which issplit into different nations, races, religious and political groups.The belief that all these fragments-in ourselves, in our environ-ment and in our society-are really separate can be seen asthe essential reason for the present series of social, ecologicaland cultural crises. It has alienated us from nature and fromour fellow human beings. It has brought a grossly unjustdistribution of natural resources creating economic and politicaldisorder; an ever rising wave of violence, both spontaneousand institutionalized, and an ugly, polluted environment inwhich life has often become physically and mentally unhealthy.The Cartesian division and the mechanistic world view havethus been beneficial and detrimental at the same time. Theywere extremely successful in the development of classicalphysics and technology, but had many adverse consequencesfor our civilization. It is fascinating to see that twentieth-centuryscience, which originated in the Cartesian split and in themechanistic world view, and which indeed only became possiblebecause of such a view, now overcomes this fragmentationand leads back to the idea of unity expressed in the earlyGreek and Eastern philosophies.In contrast to the mechanistic Western view, the Eastern.-23ModernPhysics"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24view of the world is ‘organic’. For the Eastern mystic, all thingsTheand events perceived by the senses are interrelated, connected,Tao ofand are but different aspects or manifestations of the samePhysicsultimate reality. Our tendency to divide the perceived worldinto individual and separate things and to experience ourselvesas isolated egos in this world is seen as an illusion which comesfrom our measuring and categorizing mentality. It is calledavidya, or ignorance, in Buddhist philosophy and is seen asthe state of a disturbed mind which has to be overcome:When the mind is disturbed, the multiplicity of things isproduced, but when the mind is quieted, the multiplicityof things disappears.4Although the various schools of Eastern mysticism differ inmany details, they all emphasize the basic unity of the universewhich is the central feature of their teachings. The highest aimfor their followers-whether they are Hindus, Buddhists orTaoists-is to become aware of the unity and mutual inter-relation of all things, to transcend the notion of an isolatedindividual self and to identify themselves with the ultimatereality. The emergence of this awareness-known as ‘enlighten-merit’-is not only an intellectual act but is an experiencewhich involves the whole person and is religious in its ultimatenature. For this reason, most Eastern philosophies are essentiallyreligious philosophies.In the Eastern view, then, the division of nature into separateobjects is not fundamental and any such objects have a fluidand ever-changing character. The Eastern world view is there-fore intrinsically dynamic and contains time and change asessential features. The cosmos is seen as one inseparablereality-for ever in motion, alive, organic; spiritual and materialat the same time.Since motion and change are essential properties of things,the forces causing the motion are not outside the objects, asin the classical Greek view, but are an intrinsic property ofmatter. Correspondingly, the Eastern image of the Divine isnot that of a ruler who directs the world from above, but of aprinciple that controls everything from within:He who, dwelling in all things,Yet is other than all things,Whom all things do not know,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Whose body all things are,Who controls all things from within-He is your Soul, the Inner Controller,The Immortal.5The following chapters will show that the basic elements ofthe Eastern world view are also those of the world view emergingfrom modern physics. They are intended to suggest that Easternthought and, more generally, mystical thought provide aconsistent and relevant philosophical background to thetheories of contemporary science; a conception of the worldin which man’s scientific discoveries can be in perfect harmonywith his spiritual aims and religious beliefs. The two basicthemes of this conception are the unity and interrelation of allphenomena and the intrinsically dynamic nature of the universe.The further we penetrate into the submicroscopic world, themore we shall realize how the modern physicist, like the Easternmystic, has come to see the world as a system of inseparable,interacting and ever-moving components with man being anintegral part of this system.The organic, ‘ecological’ world view of the Eastern philoso-phies is no doubt one of the main reasons for the immensepopularity they have recently gained in the West, especiallyamong young people. In our Western culture, which is stilldominated by the mechanistic, fragmented view of the world,an increasing number of people have seen this as the under-lying reason for the widespread dissatisfaction in our society,and many have turned to Eastern ways of liberation. It isinteresting, and perhaps not too surprising, that those who areattracted by Eastern mysticism, who consult the I Ching andpractise Yoga or other forms of meditation, in general have amarked anti-scientific attitude. They tend to see science, andphysics in particular, as an unimaginative, narrow-mindeddiscipline which is responsible for all the evils of moderntechnology.This book aims at improving the image of science by showingthat there is an essential harmony between the spirit of Easternwisdom and Western science. It attempts to suggest thatmodern physics goes far beyond technology, that the way-or Tao-of physics can be a path with a heart, a way to spiritualknowledge. and self-realization.25ModernPhysics"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"2 KNOWINGANDSEEINGFrom the unreal lead me to the real!From darkness lead me to light!From death lead me to immortality!Brihad-aranyaka UpanishadBefore studying the parallels between modern physics andEastern mysticism, we have to deal with the question of howwe can make any comparison at all between an exact science,expressed in the highly sophisticated language of modernmathematics, and spiritual disciplines which are mainly basedon meditation and insist on the fact that their insights cannotbe communicated verbally.What we want to compare are the statements made byscientists and Eastern mystics about their knowledge of theworld. To establish the proper framework for this comparison,we must firstly ask ourselves what kind of ‘knowledge’ we aretalking about; does the Buddhist monk from Angkor Wat orKyoto mean the same thing by ‘knowledge’ as the physicistfrom Oxford or Berkeley? Secondly, what kind of statements arewe going to compare? What are we going to select from theexperimental data, equations and theories on the one side,and from the religious scriptures, ancient myths, or philo-sophical treatises on the other? This chapter is intended toclarify these two points: the nature of the knowledge involvedand the language in which this knowledge is expressed.Throughout history, it has been recognized that the humanmind is capable of two kinds of knowledge, or two modes ofconsciousness, which have often been termed the rational and---- .._- -_--"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the intuitive, and have traditionally been associated withscience and religion, respectively. In the West, the intuitive,religious type of knowledge is often devalued in favour ofrational, scientific knowledge, whereas the traditional Easternattitude is in general just the opposite. The following statementsabout knowledge by two great minds of the West and the Easttypify the two positions. Socrates in Greece made the famousstatement ‘I know that I know nothing’, and Lao Tzu in Chinasaid, ‘Not knowing that one knows is best.’ In the East, thevalues attributed to the two kinds of knowledge are oftenalready apparent from the names given to them. The Upanishads,for example, speak about a higher and a lower knowledge andassociate the lower knowledge with various sciences, the higherwith religious awareness. Buddhists talk about ‘relative’ and‘absolute’ knowledge, or about ‘conditional truth’ and ‘trans-cendental truth’. Chinese philosophy, on the other hand, hasalways emphasized the complementary nature of the intuitiveand the rational and has represented them by the archetypalpair yin and yang which form the basis of Chinese thought.Accordingly, two complementary philosophical traditions-Taoism and Confucianism-have developed in ancient Chinato deal with the two kinds of knowledge.Rational knowledge is derived from the experience we havewith objects and events in our everyday environment. Itbelongs to the realm of the intellect whose function it is todiscriminate, divide, compare, measure and categorize. In thisway, a world of intellectual distinctions is created; of oppositeswhich can only exist in relation to each other, which is whyBuddhists call this type of knowledge ‘relative’.Abstraction is a crucial feature of this knowledge, because inorder to compare and to classify the immense variety of shapes,structures and phenomena around us we cannot take all theirfeatures into account, but have to select a few significant ones.Thus we construct an intellectual map of reality in which thingsare reduced to their general outlines. Rational knowledge isthus a system of abstract concepts and symbols, characterizedby the linear, sequential structure which is typical of ourthinking and speaking. In most languages this linear structureis made explicit by the use of alphabets which serve to com-municate experience and thought in long lines of letters."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"28The natural world, on the other hand, is one of infiniteThevarieties and complexities, a multidimensional world whichTao ofcontains no straight lines or completely regular shapes, wherePhysicsthings do not happen in sequences, but all together; a worldwhere-as modern physics tells us-even empty space iscurved. It is clear that our abstract system of conceptualthinking can never describe or understand this reality com-pletely. In thinking about the world we are faced with the samekind of problem as the cartographer who tries to cover thecurved face of the Earth with a sequence of plane maps. Wecan only expect an approximate representation of reality fromsuch a procedure, and all rational knowledge is thereforenecessarily limited.The realm of rational knowledge is, of course, the realm ofscience which measures and quantifies, classifies and analyses.The limitations of any knowledge obtained by these methodshave become increasingly apparent in modern science, and inparticular in modern physics which has taught us, in the wordsof Werner Heisenberg, ‘that every word or concept, clear asit may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability.”For most of us it is very difficult to be constantly aware of thelimitations and of the relativity of conceptual knowledge.Because our representation of reality is so much easier to graspthan reality itself, we tend to confuse the two and to take ourconcepts and symbols for reality. It is one of the main aims ofEastern mysticism to rid us of this confusion. Zen Buddhistssay that a finger is needed to point at the moon, but that weshould not trouble ourselves with the finger once the moonis recognized; the Taoist sage Chuang Tzu wrote:Fishing baskets are employed to catch fish; but when thefish are got, the men forget the baskets; snares are em-ployed to catch hares; but when the hares are got, menforget the snares. Words are employed to convey ideas;but when the ideas are grasped, men forget the words.*In the West, the semanticist Alfred Korzybski made exactlythe same point with his powerful slogan, ‘The map is not theterritory.’What the Eastern mystics are concerned with is a directexperience of reality which transcends not only intellectual"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"thinking but also sensory perception. In the words of theUpanishads,What is soundless, touchless, formless, imperishable,Likewise tasteless, constant, odourless,Without beginning, without end, higher than the great,stable-By discerning That, one is liberated from the mouth ofdeath.3Knowledge which comes from such an experience is called‘absolute knowledge’ by Buddhists because it does not relyon the discriminations, abstractions and classifications of theintellect which, as we have seen, are always relative andapproximate. It is, so we are told by Buddhists, the directexperience of undifferentiated, undivided, indeterminate ‘such-ness’. Complete apprehension of this suchness is not only thecore of Eastern mysticism, but is the central characteristic ofall mystical experience.The Eastern mystics repeatedly insist on the fact that theultimate reality can never be an object of reasoning or ofdemonstrable knowledge. It can never be adequately des-cribed by words, because it lies beyond the realms of the sensesand of the intellect from which our words and concepts arederived. The Upanishads say about it:There the eye goes not,Speech goes not, nor the mind.We know not, we understand notHow one would teach it.4Lao Tzu, who calls this reality the Tao, states the same fact inthe opening line of the Tao Te Ching: ‘The Tao that can beexpressed is not the eternal Tao.’ The fact-obvious from anyreading of the newspapers-that mankind has not becomemuch wiser over the past two thousand years, in spite of aprodigious increase in rational knowledge, is ample evidenceof the impossibility of communicating absolute knowledge bywords. As Chuang Tzu said, ‘If it could be talked about, every-body would have told their brother.‘5Absolute knowledge is thus an entirely non-intellectual-29KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"30experience of reality, an experience arising in a non-ordinaryThestate of consciousness which may be called a ‘meditative’ orTao ofmystical state. That such a state exists has not only beenPhysicstestified by numerous mystics in the East and West but is alsoindicated by psychological research. In the words of WilliamJames :Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousnessas we call it, is but one special type of consciousness,whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens,there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.6Although physicists are mainly concerned with rational know-ledge and mystics with intuitive knowledge, both types ofknowledge occur in both fields. This becomes apparent whenwe examine how knowledge is obtained and how it is ex-pressed, both in physics and Eastern mysticism.In physics, knowledge is acquired through the process ofscientific research which can be seen to proceed in threestages. The first stage consists in gathering experimentalevidence about the phenomena to be explained. In the secondstage, the experimental facts are correlated with mathematicalsymbols and a mathematical scheme is worked out whichinterconnects these symbols in a precise and consistent way.Such a scheme is usuallv called a mathematical model or, if itis more comprehensive, a theory. This theory is then used topredict the results of further experiments which are under-taken to check all its implications. At this stage, physicists maybe satisfied when they have found a mathematical scheme andknow how to use it to predict experiments. But eventually,they will want to talk about their results to non-physicists andwill therefore have to express them in plain language. Thismeans they will have to formulate a model in ordinary languagewhich interprets their mathematical scheme. Even for thephysicists themselves, the formulation of such a verbal model,which constitutes the third stage of research, will be a criterionof the understanding they have reached.In practice, of course, the three stages are not neatly separatedand do not always occur in the same order. For example, aphysicist may be led to a particular model by some philosophical_-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"belief he (or she) holds, which he may continue to believe in,even when contrary experimental evidence arises. He willthen-and this happens in fact very often-try to modify hismodel so that it can account for the new experiments. But ifexperimental evidence continues to contradict the model hewill eventually be forced to drop it.This way of basing all theories firmly on experiment is knownas the scientific method and we shall see that it has its counter-part in Eastern philosophy. Greek philosophy, on the otherhand, was fundamentally different in that respect. AlthoughGreek philosophers had extremely ingenious ideas aboutnature which often come very close to modern scientific models,the enormous difference between the two is the empiricalattitude of modern science which was by and large foreign tothe Creek mind. The Greeks obtained their models deductivelyfrom some fundamental axiom or principle and not inductivelyfrom what had been observed. On the other hand, of course,the Greek art of deductive reasoning and logic is an essentialingredient in the second stage of scientific research, theformulation of a consistent mathematical model, and thus anessential part of science.Rational knowledge and rational activities certainly con-stitute the major part of scientific research, but are not allthere is to it. The rational part of research would, in fact, beuseless if it were not complemented by the intuition that givesscientists new insights and makes them creative. These insightstend to come suddenly and, characteristically, not whensitting at a desk working out the equations, but when relaxing,in the bath, during a walk in the woods, on the beach, etc.During these periods of relaxation after concentrated intellectualactivity, the intuitive mind seems to take over and can producethe sudden clarifying insights which give so much joy anddelight to scientific research.Intuitive insights, however, are of no use to physics unlessthey can be formulated in a consistent mathematical frame-work, supplemented by an interpretation in plain language.Abstraction is a crucial feature of this framework. It consists,as mentioned before, of a system of concepts and symbolswhich constitute a map of reality. This map represents onlysome features of reality; we do not know exactly which these31KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"32are, since we started compiling our map gradually and withoutThecritical analysis in our childhood. The words of our languageTao ofare thus not clearly defined. They have several meanings,Physicsmany of which pass only vaguely through our mind andremain largely in our subconscious when we hear a word.The inaccuracy and ambiguity of our language is essentialfor poets who work largely with its subconscious layers andassociations. Science, on the other hand, aims for cleardefinitions and unambiguous connections, and therefore itabstracts language further by limiting the meaning of its wordsand by standardizing its structure, in accordance with the rulesof logic. The ultimate abstraction takes place in mathematicswhere words are replaced by symbols and where the operationsof connecting the symbols are rigorously defined. In this way,scientists can condense information into one equation, i.e.into one single line of symbols, for which they would needseveral pages of ordinary writing.The view that mathematics is nothing but an extremelyabstracted and compressed language does not go unchallenged.Many mathematicians, in fact, believe that mathematics isnot just a language to describe nature, but is inherent innature itself. The originator of this belief was Pythagoras whomade the famous statement ‘All things are numbers’ anddeveloped a very special kind of mathematical mysticism.Pythagorean philosophy thus introduced logical reasoninginto the domain of religion, a development which, accordingto Bertrand Russell, was decisive for Western religious philo-sophy :The combination of mathematics and theology, whichbegan with Pythagoras, characterized religious philosophyin Greece, in the Middle Ages, and in modern times downto Kant . . .In Plato, St Augustine, Thomas Aquinas,Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz there is an intimateblending of religion and reasoning, of moral aspirationwith logical admiration of what is timeless, which comesfrom Pythagoras, and distinguishes the intellectualizedtheology of Europe from the more straightforwardmysticism of Asia.’"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The ‘more straightforward mysticism of Asia’ would, ofcourse, not adopt the Pythagorean view of mathematics. Inthe Eastern view, mathematics, with its highly differentiatedand well defined structure, must be seen as part of our con-ceptual map and not as a feature of reality itself. Reality, asexperienced by the mystic, is completely indeterminate andundifferentiated.The scientific method of abstraction is very efficient andpowerful, but we have to pay a price for it. As we define oursystem of concepts more precisely, as we streamline it andmake the connections more and more rigorous, it becomesincreasingly detached from the real world. Using againKorzybski’s analogy of the map and the territory, we could saythat ordinary language is a map which, due to its intrinsicinaccuracy, has a certain flexibility so that it can follow thecurved shape of the territory to some degree. As we make itmore rigorous, this flexibility gradually disappears, and withthe language of mathematics we have reached a point wherethe links with reality are so tenuous that the relation of thesymbols to our sensory experience is no longer evident. Thisis why we have to supplement our mathematical models andtheories with verbal interpretations, again using conceptswhich can be understood intuitively, but which are slightlyambiguous and inaccurate.It is important to realize the difference between the mathe-matical models and their verbal counterparts. The former arerigorous and consistent as far as their internal structure isconcerned, but their symbols are not directly related to ourexperience. The verbal models, on the other hand, use con-cepts which can be understood intuitively, but are alwaysinaccurate and ambiguous.They are in this respect notdifferent from philosophical models of reality and thus the twocan very well be compared.If there is an intuitive element in science, there is also a rationalelement in Eastern mysticism. The degree to which reason andlogic are emphasized, however, varies enormously from oneschool to the other. The Hindu Vedanta, or the BuddhistMadhyamika, for example, are highly intellectual schools,_- ..__ ---.- .--. ----.“I. .-._ ..- -.-.__- --__---_ l_l____-33KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"34whereas Taoists have always had a deep mistrust of reasonTheand logic. Zen, which grew out of Buddhism but was stronglyTao ofinfluenced by Taoism, prides itself on being ‘without words,Physicswithout explanations,without instructions, without know-ledge’. It concentrates almost entirely on the experience ofenlightenment and is only marginally interested in interpretingthis experience. A well known Zen phrase says ‘The instantyou speak about a thing you miss the mark.’Although other schools of Eastern mysticism are less extreme,the direct mystical experience is at the core of all of them.Even those mystics who are engaged in the most sophisticatedargumentation never see the intellect as their source of know-ledge but use it merely to analyse and interpret their personalmystical experience. All knowledge is firmly based on thisexperience, thus giving the Eastern traditions a strong empiricalcharacter that is always emphasized by its proponents.D. T. Suzuki, for example, writes of Buddhism:Personal experience is . . .the foundation of Buddhistphilosophy. In this sense Buddhism is radical empiricismor experientialism, whatever dialectic later developed toprobe the meaning of enlightenment-experience.8Joseph Needham repeatedly brings the empirical attitudeof Taoists into prominence in his work Science and Civilisationin China and finds that this attitude has made Taoism the basisof Chinese science and technology. The early Taoist philo-sophers, in Needham’s words, ‘withdrew into the wilderness,the forests and mountains, there to meditate upon the Orderof Nature, and to observe its innumerable manifestations’.qThe same spirit is reflected in the Zen verses,He who would understand the meaning of Buddha-natureMust watch for the season and the causal relations.lOThe firm basis of knowledge on experience in Easternmysticism suggests a parallel to the firm basis of scientificknowledge on experiment. This parallel is further enforced bythe nature of the mystical experience. It is described in theEastern traditions as a direct insight which lies outside therealm of the intellect and is obtained by watching rather thanthinking; by looking inside oneself; by observation._"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"In Taoism, this notion of observation is embodied in thename for Taoist temples, kuan, which originally meant ‘to look’.Taoists thus regarded their temples as places of observation.In Ch’an Buddhism, the Chinese version of Zen, enlightenmentis often referred to as ‘the vision of the Tao’, and seeing isregarded as the basis of knowing in all Buddhist schools. Thefirst item of the Eightfold Path, the Buddha’s prescription forself-realization, is right seeing, followed by right knowing.D. T. Suzuki writes on this point:The seeing plays the most important role in Buddhistepistemology, for seeing is at the basis of knowing.Knowing is impossible without seeing; all knowledge has itsorigin in seeing. Knowing and seeing are thus foundgenerally united in Buddha’s teaching. Buddhist philosophytherefore ultimately points to seeing reality as it is. Seeingis experiencing enlightenment.”This passage is also reminiscent of the Yaqui mystic Don Juanwho says, ‘My predilection is to see . . . because only by seeingcan a man of knowledge know.‘12A word of caution should perhaps be added here. Theemphasis on seeing in mystical traditions should not be takentoo literally, but has to be understood in a metaphorical sense,since the mystical experience of reality is an essentially non-sensory experience. When the Eastern mystics talk about‘seeing’, they refer to a mode of perception which may includevisual perception, but which always and essentially transcendsit to become a nonsensory experience of reality. What they doemphasize, however, when they talk about seeing, looking orobserving, is the empirical character of their knowledge. Thisempirical approach of Eastern philosophy is strongly reminiscentof the emphasis on observation in science and thus suggestsa framework for our comparison. The experimental stage inscientific research seems to correspond to the direct insightof the Eastern mystic, and the scientific models and theoriescorrespond to the various ways in which this insight is inter-preted.The parallel between scientific experiments and mystical,experiences may seem surprising in view of the very differentnature of these acts of observation. Physicists perform experi-35KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"36ments involving an elaborate teamwork and a highly sophisti-Thecated technology, whereas mystics obtain their knowledgeTao ofpurely through introspection, without any machinery, in thePhysicsprivacy of meditation. Scientific experiments, furthermore,seem to be repeatable any time and by anybody, whereasmystical experiences seem to be reserved for a few individualsat special occasions. A closer examination shows, however,that the differences between the two kinds of observationlie only in their approach and not in their reliability orcomplexity.Anybody who wants to repeat an experiment in modernsubatomic physics has to undergo many years of training.Only then will he or she be able to ask nature a specific questionthrough the experiment and to understand the answer.Similarly, a deep mystical experience requires, generally, manyyears of training under an experienced master and, as in thescientific training, the dedicated time does not alone guaranteesuccess. If the student is successful, however, he or she will beable to ‘repeat the experiment’. The repeatability of theexperience is, in fact, essential to every mystical training andis the very aim of the mystics’ spiritual instruction.A mystical experience, therefore, is not any more uniquethan a modern experiment in physics. On the other hand, it isnot less sophisticated either, although its sophistication is of avery different kind. The complexity and efficiency of thephysicist’s technical apparatus is matched, if not surpassed,by that of the mystic’s consciousness-both physical andspiritual-in deep meditation. The scientists and the mystics,then, have developed highly sophisticated methods of ob-serving nature which are inaccessible to the layperson. A pagefrom a journal of modern experimental physics will be asmysterious to the uninitiated as a Tibetan mandala. Both arerecords of enquiries into the nature of the universe.Although deep mystical experiences do not, in general, occurwithout long preparation,direct intuitive insights are ex-perienced by all of us in our everyday lives. We are all familiarwith the situation where we have forgotten the name of aperson or place, or some other word, and cannot produce itin spite of the utmost concentration. We have it ‘on the tip"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"of our tongue’ but it just will not come out, until we give upand shift our attention to-something else when suddenly, in aflash, we remember the forgotten name. No thinking is involvedin this process. It is a sudden, immediate insight. This exampleof suddenly remembering something is particularly relevant toBuddhism which holds that our original nature is that of theenlightened Buddha and that we have just forgotten it. Studentsof Zen Buddhism are asked to discover their ‘original face’and the sudden ‘remembering’ of this face is their enlighten-ment.Another well known example of spontaneous intuitive in-sights are jokes. In the split second where you understand ajoke you experience a moment of ‘enlightenment’. It is wellknown that this moment must come spontaneously, that itcannot be achieved by ‘explaining’ the joke, i.e. by intellectualanalysis. Only with a sudden intuitive insight into the natureof the joke do we experience the liberating laughter the jokeis meant to produce. The similarity between a spiritual insightand the understanding of a joke must be well known toenlightened men and women, since they almost invariablyshow a great sense of humour. Zen, especially, is full of funnystories and anecdotes, and in the Tao Te Ching we read, ‘Ifit were not laughed at, it would not be sufficient to be Tao.‘13In our everyday life, direct intuitive insights into the natureof things are normally limited to extremely brief moments.Not so in Eastern mysticism where they are extended to longperiods and, ultimately, become a constant awareness. Thepreparation of the mind for this awareness-for the immediate,nonconceptual awareness of reality-is the main purpose ofall schools of Eastern mysticism, and of many aspects of theEastern way of life. During the long cultural history of India,China and Japan, an enormous variety of techniques, ritualsand art forms have been developed to achieve this purpose,all of which may be called meditation in the widest sense ofthe word.The basic aim of these techniques seems to be to silencethe thinking mind and to shift the awareness from the rationalto the intuitive mode of consciousness. In many forms ofmeditation, this silencing of the rational mind is achieved byconcentrating one’s attention on a single item, like one’s37KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"TheTao ofPhysicsbreathing, the sound of a mantra, or the visual image of amandala.

In my experience, for example, skiing has beenSeeinga highly rewarding form of meditation.Eastern art forms, too, are forms of meditation. They are notso much means for expressing the artist’s ideas as ways ofself-realization through the development of the intuitive modeof consciousness. Indian music is not learned by reading notes,but by listening to the play of the teacher and thus developinga feeling for the music, just as the Tai Chi movements are notlearned by verbal instructions but by doing them over andover again in unison with the teacher. Japanese tea ceremoniesare full of slow, ritualistic movements. Chinese calligraphyrequires the uninhibited, spontaneous movement of the hand.All these skills are used in the East to develop the meditativemode of consciousness.For most people, and especially for intellectuals, this modeof consciousness is a completely new experience. Scientistsare familiar with direct intuitive insights from their research,because every new discovery originates in such a suddennon-verbal flash. But these are extremely short moments whicharise when the mind is filled with information, with conceptsand thought patterns. In meditation, on the other hand, themind is emptied of all thoughts and concepts and thus preparedto function for long periods through its intuitive mode. LaoTzu speaks about this contrast between research and meditationwhen he says:He who pursues learning will increase every day;He who pursues Tao will decrease every day.14When the rational mind is silenced, the intuitive modeproduces an extraordinary awareness; the environment isexperienced in a direct way without the filter of conceptualthinking. In the words of Chuang Tzu, ‘The still mind of thesage is a mirror of heaven and earth-the glass of all things.‘15The experience of oneness with the surrounding environmentis the main characteristic of this meditative state.

They are not allowed to distract theattention. Such a state of awareness is not unlike the state ofmind of a warrior who expects an attack in extreme alertness,registering everything that goes on around him without beingdistracted by it for an instant. The Zen master Yasutani Roshiuses this image in his description of shikan-taza, the practice ofZen meditation :Shikan-taza is a heightened state of concentrated aware-ness wherein one is neither tense nor hurried, and certainlynever slack. It is the mind of somebody facing death.

But not for an instant is your mind capturedby these sense impressions.16Because of the similarity between the meditative state and theframe of mind of a warrior, the image of the warrior plays animportant role in the spiritual and cultural life of the East. Thestage for India’s favourite religious text, the Bhagavad Cita, is abattlefield and martial arts constitute an important part in thetraditional cultures of China and Japan. In Japan, the stronginfluence of Zen on the tradition of the samurai gave rise towhat is known as bushido, ‘the way of the warrior’, an art ofswordsmanship where the spiritual insight of the swordsmanreaches its highest perfection. The Taoist Tai Chi Ch’uan,which was considered to be the supreme martial art in China,combines slow and rhythmical ‘yogic’ movements with thetotal alertness of the warrior’s mind in a unique way.Eastern mysticism is based on direct insights into the nature"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"of reality, and physics is based on the observation of naturalphenomena in scientific experiments. In both fields, theobservations are then interpreted and the interpretation isvery often communicated by words. Since words are alwaysan abstract, approximate map of reality, the verbal inter-pretations of a scientific experiment or of a mystical insightare necessarily inaccurate and incomplete. Modern physicistsand Eastern mystics alike are well aware of this fact.In physics, the interpretations of experiments are calledmodels or theories and the realization that all models andtheories are approximate is basic to modern scientific research.Thus the aphorism of Einstein, ‘As far as the laws of mathematicsrefer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they arecertain, they do not refer to reality.’ Physicists know that theirmethods of analysis and logical reasoning can never explainthe whole realm of natural phenomena at once and so theysingle out a certain group of phenomena and try to build amodel to describe this group. In doing so, they neglect otherphenomena and the model will therefore not give a completedescription of the real situation. The phenomena which arenot taken into account may either have such a small effectthat their inclusion would not alter the theory significantly, orthey may be left out simply because they are not known atthe time when the theory is built.To illustrate these points, let us look at one of the bestknown models in physics, Newton’s ‘classical’ mechanics. Theeffects of air resistance or friction, for example, are generallynot taken into account in this model, because they are usuallyvery small. But apart from such omissions, Newtonian mechanicswas for a long time considered to be the final theory for thedescription of all natural phenomena, until electric and mag-netic phenomena, which had no place in Newton’s theory,were discovered. The discovery of these phenomena showedthat the model was incomplete, that it could be applied onlyto a limited group of phenomena, essentially the motion ofsolid bodies.Studying a limited group of phenomena can also meanstudying their physical properties only over a limited range,which may be another reason for the theory to be approximate.This aspect of the approximation is quite subtle because we41KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"42never know beforehand where the limitations of a theory lie.TheOnly experience can tell. Thus the image of classical mechanicsTao ofwas further eroded when twentieth-century physics showedPhysicsits essential limitations. Today we know that the Newtonianmodel is valid only for objects consisting of large numbers ofatoms, and only for velocities which are small compared tothe speed of light. When the first condition is not given,classical mechanics has to be replaced by quantum theory;when the second condition is not satisfied, relativity theoryhas to be applied. This does not mean that Newton’s model is‘wrong’, or that quantum theory and relativity theory are‘right’. All these models are approximations which are valid fora certain range of phenomena. Beyond this range, they nolonger give a satisfactory description of nature and new modelshave to be found to replace the old ones-or, better, toextend them by improving the approximation.To specify the limitations of a given model is often one ofthe most difficult, and yet one of the most important tasks inits construction. According to Geoffrey Chew, whose ‘bootstrapmodels’ will be discussed at great length later on, it is essentialthat one should always ask, as soon as a certain model ortheory is found to work: why does it work? what are the model’slimits? in what way, exactly, is it an approximation? Thesequestions are seen by Chew as the first step towards furtherprogress.The Eastern mystics, too, are well aware of the fact that allverbal descriptions of reality are inaccurate and incomplete.The direct experience of reality transcends the realm of thoughtand language, and, since all mysticism is based on such a directexperience, everything that is said about it can only be partlytrue. In physics, the approximate nature of all statements isquantified and progress is made by improving the approxi-mations in many successive steps. How, then, do the Easterntraditions deal with the problem of verbal communication?First of all, mystics are mainly interested in the experience ofreality and not in the description of this experience. They aretherefore generally not interested in the analysis of such adescription, and the concept of a well-defined approximationhas thus never arisen in Eastern thought. If, on the other hand,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Eastern mystics want to communicate Jheir experience, theyare confronted with the limitations of language. Several differentways have been developed in the East to deal with this problem.Indian mysticism,and Hinduism in particular, clothes itsstatements in the form of myths, using metaphors and symbols,poetic images, similes and allegories. Mythical language ismuch less restricted by logic and common sense. It is full ofmagic and of paradoxical situations, rich in suggestive imagesand never precise, and can thus convey the way in whichmystics experience reality much better than factual language.According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, ‘myth embodies thenearest approach to absolute truth that can be stated inwords.“’The rich Indian imagination has created a vast number ofgods and goddesses whose incarnations and exploits are thesubjects of fantastic tales, collected in epics of huge dimensions.The Hindu with deep insight knows that all these gods arecreations of the mind, mythical images representing the manyfaces of reality. On the other hand, he also knows that theywere not merely created to make the stories more attractive,but are essential vehicles to convey the doctrines of a philosophyrooted in mystical experience.Chinese and Japanese mystics have found a different wayof dealing with the language problem. Instead of making theparadoxical nature of reality palatable through the symbolsand images of myth, they prefer very often to accentuate it byusing factual language. Thus Taoists made frequent use ofparadoxes in order to expose the inconsistencies arising fromverbal communication and to show its limits. They have passedthis technique on to Chinese and Japanese Buddhists whohave developed it further. It has reached its extreme in ZenBuddhism with the so-called koans, those nonsensical riddleswhich are used by many Zen masters to transmit the teachings.These koans establish an important parallel to modern physicswhich will be taken up in the next chapter.In Japan, there exists yet another mode of expressing philo-sophical views which should be mentioned. It is a special formof extremely concise poetry which is often used by Zen mastersto point directly at the ‘suchness’ of reality. When a monk43KnowingandSeeing"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"44asked Fuketsu Ensho, When speech and silence are bothTheinadmissible, how can one pass without error? the masterTao ofreplied :PhysicsI always remember Kiangsu in March-The cry of the partridge,The mass of fragrant flowers.18This form of spiritual poetry has reached its perfection in thehaiku, a classical Japanese verse of just seventeen syllables,which was deeply influenced by Zen. The insight into the verynature of Life reached by these haiku poets comes across evenin the English translation:Leaves fallingLie on one another;The rain beats the rain.lqWhenever the Eastern mystics express their knowledge inwords-be it with the help of myths, symbols, poetic imagesor paradoxicalstatements-they are well aware of the limita-tions imposed by language and ‘linear’ thinking. Modernphysics has come to take exactly the same attitude with regardto its verbal models and theories. They, too, are only approxi-mate and necessarily inaccurate. They are the counterpartsof the Eastern myths, symbols and poetic images, and it is atthis level that I shall draw the parallels. The same idea aboutmatter is conveyed, for example, to the Hindu by the cosmicdance of the god Shiva as to the physicist by certain aspectsof quantum field theory.

Inthe schools of Western philosophy, logic and reasoning havealways been the main tools used to formulate philosophicalideas and this is true, according to Bertrand Russell, even ofreligious philosophies. In Eastern mysticism, on the other hand,it has always been realized that reality transcends ordinarylanguage, and the sages of the East were not afraid to gobeyond logic and common concepts. This is the main reason,I think, why their models of reality constitute a more appro-priate philosophical background to modern physics than themodels of Western philosophy.The problem of language encountered by the Eastern mysticis exactly the same as the problem the modern physicist faces.In the two passages quoted at the beginning of this chapter,D. T. Suzuki speaks about Buddhism2 and Werner Heisenbergspeaks about atomic physics,3 and yet the two passages arealmost identical. Both the physicist and the mystic want tocommunicate their knowledge, and when they do so withwords their statements are paradoxical and full of logicalcontradictions. These paradoxes are characteristic of allmysticism, from Heraclitus to Don Juan, and since the beginningof this century they are also characteristic of physics.In atomic physics, many of the paradoxical situations areconnected with the dual nature of light or-more generally-of electromagnetic radiation. On the one hand, it is clear thatthis radiation must consist of waves because it produces thewell-known interference phenomena associated with waves:when there are two sources of light, the i,ntensity of the lightto be found at some other place will not necessarily be just thesum of that which comes from the two sources, but may bemore or less. This can easily be explained by the interferenceof the waves emanating from the two sources: in those placeswhere two crests coincide we shall have more light than thesum of the two; where a crest and a trough coincide we shallhave less. The precise amount of interference can easily be_"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"interference of two wavescalculated. Interference phenomena of this kind can beobserved whenever one deals with electromagnetic radiation,and force us to conclude that this radiation consists of waves.On the otner hand, electromagnetic radiation also producesthe so-called photoelectric effect: when ultraviolet light isshone on the surface of some metals it can ‘kick out’ electronsfrom the surface of the metal, and therefore it must consist ofmoving particles. A similar situation occurs in the ‘scattering’experiments of X-rays. These experiments can only be inter-preted correctly if they are described as collisions of ‘lightparticles’ with electrons. And yet, they show the interferencepatterns characteristic of waves. The question which puzzledphysicists so much in the early stages of atomic theory washow electromagnetic radiation could simultaneously consistof particles (i.e. of entities confined to a very small volume) andof waves, which are spread out over a large area of space.Neither language nor imagination could deal with this kind ofreality very well.Eastern mysticism has developed several different ways ofdealing with the paradoxical aspects of reality. Whereas theyare bypassed in Hinduism through the use of mythical language,Buddhism and Taoism tend to emphasize the paradoxes rather47BeyondLanguage"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"48than conceal them. The main Taoist scripture, Lao Tzu’s TaoTheTe Ching, is written in an extremely puzzling, seeminglyTao ofillogical style. It is full of intriguing contradictions and itsPhysicscompact, powerful, and extremely poetic language is meant toarrest the reader’s mind and throw it off its familiar tracks oflogical reasoning.Chinese and Japanese Buddhists have adopted this Taoisttechnique of communicating the mystical experience by simplyexposing its paradoxical character. When the Zen masterDaito saw the Emperor Codaigo, who was a student of Zen, themaster said :We were parted many thousands of kalpas ago, yet we havenot been separated even for a moment. We are facing eachother all day long, yet we have never met.4Zen Buddhists have a particular knack for making a virtueout of the inconsistencies arising from verbal communication,and with the koan system they have developed a unique wayof transmitting their teachings completely non-verbally. Koansare carefully devised nonsensical riddles which are meant tomake the student of Zen realize the limitations of logic andreasoning in the most dramatic way. The irrational wordingand paradoxical content of these riddles makes it impossibleto solve them by thinking. They are designed precisely to stopthe thought process and thus to make the student ready forthe non-verbal experience of reality. The contemporary Zenmaster Yasutani introduced a Western student to one of themost famous koans with the following words:One of the best koans, because the simplest, is Mu. Thisis its background: A monk came to Joshu, a renownedZen master in China hundreds of years ago, and asked:‘Has a dog Buddha-nature or not? Joshu retorted, ‘Mu!’Literally, the expression means ‘no’ or ‘not’, but the sig-nificance of Joshu’s answer does not lie in this. Mu is theexpression of the living, functioning, dynamic Buddha-nature. What you must do is discover the spirit or essenceof this Mu, not through intellectual analysis but by searchinto your innermost being.

Remember, you can’tLanguageunderstand Mu through ordinary cognition, you must graspit directly with your whole being.5To a beginner, the Zen master will normally present eitherthis Mu-koan or one of the following two:‘What was your original face-the one you had beforeyour parents gave birth to you?‘You can make the sound of two hands clapping. Nowwhat is the sound of one hand?All these koans have more or less unique solutions which acompetent master recognizes immediately. Once the solutionis found, the koan ceases to be paradoxical and becomes aprofoundly meaningful statement made from the state ofconsciousness which it has helped to awaken.In the Rinzai school, the student has to solve a long seriesof koans, each of them dealing with a particular aspect ofZen. This is the only way this school transmits its teachings.It does not use any positive statements, but leaves it entirelyto the student to grasp the truth through the koans.Here we find a striking parallel to the paradoxical situationswhich confronted physicists at the beginning of atomic physics.As in Zen, the truth was hidden in paradoxes that could notbe solved by logical reasoning, but had to be understood inthe terms of a new awareness; the awareness of the atomicreality. The teacher here was, of course, nature, who, like theZen masters, does not provide any statements. She just providesthe riddles.The solving of a koan demands a supreme effort of concentra-tion and involvement from the student. In books about Zenwe read that the koan grips the student’s heart and mind andcreates a true mental impasse, a state of sustained tension inwhich the whole world becomes an enormous mass of doubtand questioning.

This has alwaysbeen recognized by the mystics, but has become a problemin science only very recently. For centuries, scientists weresearching for the ‘fundamental laws of nature’ underlying thegreat variety of natural phenomena. These phenomena be-longed to the scientists’ macroscopic environment and thus tothe realm of their sensory experience. Since the images andintellectual concepts of their language were abstracted fromthis very experience, they were sufficient and adequate todescribe the natural phenomena.Questions about the essential nature of things were answeredin classical physics by the Newtonian mechanistic model ofthe universe which, much in the same way as the Democriteanmodel in ancient Greece, reduced all phenomena to themotions and interactions of hard indestructible atoms. Theproperties of these atoms were abstracted from the macro-scopic notion of billiard balls, and thus from sensory experience.Whether this notion could actually be applied to the world ofatoms was not questioned. Indeed, it could not be investigatedexperimentally.In the twentieth century, however, physicists were able totackle the question about the ultimate nature of matterexperimentally. With the help of a most sophisticated tech-nology they were able to probe deeper and deeper into nature,uncovering one layer of matter after the other in search for itsultimate ‘building blocks’.

The atomic and subatomic worlditself lies beyond our sensory perception.It is, then, with the help of modern instrumentation that weare able to ‘observe’ the properties of atoms and their con-stituents in an indirect way, and thus to ‘experience’ the sub-atomic world to some extent. This experience, however, is notan ordinary one, comparable to that of our daily environment.The knowledge about matter at this level is no longer derivedfrom direct sensory experience, and therefore our ordinarylanguage, which takes its images from the world of the senses,is no longer adequate to describe the observed phenomena.As we penetrate deeper and deeper into nature, we have toabandon more and more of the images and concepts ofordinary language.On this journey to the world of the infinitely small, the mostimportant step, from a philosophical point of view, was thefirst one: the step into the world of atoms. Probing inside theatom and investigating its structure, science transcended thelimits of. our sensory imagination. From this point on, it couldno longer rely with absolute certainty on logic and commonsense. Atomic physics provided the scientists with the firstglimpses of the essential nature of things. Like the mystics,physicists were now dealing with a nonsensory experience ofreality and, like the mystics, they had to face the paradoxicalaspects of this experience.

In thefollowing two passages, the European physicist Niels Bohr andthe Indian mystic Sri Aurobindo both express the depth andthe radical character of this experience.The great extension of our experience in recent years hasbrought to light the insufficiency of our simple mechanicalconceptions and, as a consequence, has shaken thefoundation on which the customary interpretation ofobservation was based.4Niels BohrAll things in fact begin to change their nature and ap-pearance; one’s whole experience of the world is radicallydifferent . . .There is a new vast and deep way of ex-periencing, seeing, knowing, contacting things.5Sri AurobindoThis chapter will serve to sketch a preliminary picture of thisnew conception of the world against the contrasting backgroundof classical physics;*showing how the classical mechanisticworld view had to be abandoned at the beginning of thiscentury when quantum theory and relativity theory-the twobasic theories of modern physics-forced us to adopt a muchmore subtle, holistic and ‘organic’ view of nature.*The reader who finds this preliminary presentation of modern physics toocompressed and difficult to understand should not be unduly worried. All ofthe concepts mentioned in this chapter will be discussed in greater detail lateron."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"CLASSICAL PHYSICSThe world view which was changed by the discoveries ofmodern physics had been based on Newton’s mechanicalmodel of the universe. This model constituted the solid frame-work of classical physics. It was indeed a most formidablefoundation supporting, like a mighty rock, all of science andproviding a firm basis for natural philosophy for almost threecenturies.The stage of the Newtonian universe, on which all physicalphenomena took place, was the three-dimensional space ofclassical Euclidean geometry. It was an absolute space, alwaysat rest and unchangeable. In Newton’s own words, ‘Absolutespace, in its own nature, without regard to anything external,remains always similar and immovable.‘6 All changes in thephysical world were described in terms of a separate dimension,called time, which again was absolute, having no connectionwith the material world and flowing smoothly from the pastthrough the present to the future. ‘Absolute, true, and mathe-matical time,’ said Newton, ‘of itself and by its own nature,flows uniformly, without regard to anything external.”The elements of the Newtonian world which moved in thisabsolute space and absolute time were material particles. Inthe mathematical equations they were treated as ‘mass points’and Newton saw them as small, solid, and indestructibleobjects out of which all matter was made. This model wasquite similar to that of the Creek atomists. Both were based onthe distinction between the full and the void, between matterand space, and in both models the particles remained alwaysidentical in their mass and shape. Matter was therefore alwaysconserved and essentially passive. The important differencebetween the Democritean and Newtonian atomism is that thelatter includes a precise description of the force acting betweenthe material particles. This force is very simple, dependingonly on the masses and the mutual distances of the particles.It is the force of gravity, and it was seen by Newton as rigidlyconnected with the bodies it acted upon, and as actinginstantaneously over a distance. Although this was a strangehypothesis, it was not investigated further. The particles andthe forces between them were seen as created by God and55TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"56thus were not subject to further analysis. In his Opticks,TheNewton gives us a clear picture of how he imagined Cod’sTao ofcreation of the material world:PhysicsIt seems probable to me that Cod in the beginning formedmatter in solid, massy,hard, impenetrable, movableparticles, of such sizes and figures, and with such otherproperties, and in such proportion to space, as mostconduced to the end for which he formed them; and thatthese primitive particles being solids, are incomparablyharder than any porous bodies compounded of them;even so very hard, as never to wear or break in pieces;no ordinary power being able to divide what God himselfmade one in the first creation.8All physical events are reduced, in Newtonian mechanics,to the motion of material points in space, caused by theirmutual attraction, i.e. by the force of gravity. In order to putthe effect of this force on a mass point into a precise mathe-matical form, Newton had to invent completely new conceptsand mathematical techniques, those of differential calculus.This was a tremendous intellectual achievement and has beenpraised by Einstein as ‘perhaps the greatest advance in thoughtthat a single individual was ever privileged to make’.Newton’s equations of motion are the basis of classicalmechanics. They were considered to be fixed laws accordingto which material points move, and were thus thought toaccount for all changes observed in the physical world. In theNewtonian view, Cod had created, in the beginning, thematerial particles, the forces between them, and the funda-mental laws of motion. In this way, the whole universe wasset in motion and it has continued to run ever since, like amachine, governed by immutable laws.The mechanistic view of nature is thus closely related to arigorous determinism. The giant cosmic machine was seen asbeing completely causal and determinate. All that happenedhad a definite cause and gave rise to a definite effect, and thefuture of any part of the system could-in principle-bepredicted with absolute certainty if its state at any time wasknown in all details.

As a consequence of this division, it was believedthat the world could be described objectively, i.e. withoutever mentioning the human observer, and such an objectivedescription of nature became the ideal of all science.The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed atremendous success of Newtonian mechanics. Newton himselfapplied his theory to the movement of the planets and wasable to explain the basic features of the solar system. Hisplanetary model was greatly simplified, however, neglecting,for example, the gravitational influence of the planets on eachother, and thus he found that there were certain irregularitieswhich he could not explain. He resolved this problem by as-suming that Cod was always present in the universe to correctthese irregularities.Laplace, the great mathematician, set himself the ambitioustask of refining and perfecting Newton’s calculations in a bookwhich should ‘offer a complete solution of the great mechanicalproblem presented by the solar system, and bring theory tocoincide so closely with observation that empirical equationswould no longer find a place in astronomical tables’.‘0 Theresult was a large work in five volumes, called MecaniqueCeleste in which Laplace succeeded in explaining the motionsof the planets, moons and comets down to the smallestdetails, as well as the flow of the tides and other phenomenarelated to gravity.

Finally, even the theory of heat could be reduced tomechanics when it was realized that heat was the energycreated by a complicated ‘jiggling’ motion of the molecules.When the temperature of, say, water is increased the motionof the water molecules increases until they overcome the forcesholding them together and fly apart. In this way, water turnsinto steam. On the other hand, when the thermal motion isslowed down by cooling the water, the molecules finally lockinto a new, more rigid pattern which is ice. In a similar way,many other thermal phenomena can be understood quite wellfrom a purely mechanistic point of view.watersteamiceThe enormous success of the mechanistic model madephysicists of the early nineteenth century believe that theuniverse was indeed a huge mechanical system runningaccording to the Newtonian laws of motion.

The first of these developments was the discoveryand investigation of electric and magnetic phenomena whichcould not be described appropriately by the mechanisticmodel and involved a new type of force. The important stepwas made by Michael Faraday and Clerk Maxwell-the first,one of the greatest experimenters in the history of science,the second, a brilliant theorist. When Faraday produced anelectric current in a coil of copper by moving a magnet nearit, and thus converted the mechanical work of moving themagnet into electric energy, he brought science and tech-nology to a turning point. His fundamental experiment gavebirth, on the one hand, to the vast technology of electricalengineering; on the other hand, it formed the basis of his andMaxwell’s theoretical speculations which, eventually, resultedin a complete theory of electromagnetism. Faraday andMaxwell did not only study the effects of the electric and mag-netic forces, but made the forces themselves the primaryobject of their investigation. They replaced the concept of aforce by that of a force field, and in doing so they were thefirst to go beyond Newtonian physics.Instead of interpreting the interaction between a positiveand a negative charge simply by saying that the two chargesattract each other like two masses in Newtonian mechanics,Faraday and Maxwell found it more appropriate to say thateach charge creates a ‘disturbance’, or a ‘condition’, in thespace around it so that the other charge, when it is present,feels a force. This condition in space which has the potentialof producing a force is called a field. It is created by a singlecharge and it exists whether or not another charge is broughtin to feel its effect.This was a most profound change in man’s conception ofphysical reality. In the Newtonian view, the forces were rigidlyconnected with the bodies they act upon.

The culmination of this theory,called electrodynamics, was the realization that light is nothingbut a rapidly alternating electromagnetic field travelling throughspace in the form of waves. Today we know that radio waves,light waves or X-rays, are all electromagnetic waves, oscillatingelectric and magnetic fields differing only in the frequency oftheir oscillation, and that visible light is only a tiny fraction ofthe electromagnetic spectrum.In spite of these far-reaching changes, Newtonian mechanicsat first held its position as the basis of all physics. Maxwellhimself tried to explain his results in mechanical terms, inter-preting the fields as states of mechanical stress in a very lightspace-filling medium, called ether, and the electromagneticwaves as elastic waves of this ether. This was only natural aswaves are usually experienced as vibrations of something;water waves as vibrations of water, sound waves as vibrationsof air. Maxwell, however, used several mechanical interpreta-tions of his theory at the same time and apparently took noneof them really seriously. He must have realized intuitively, evenif he did not say so explicitly, that the fundamental entities inhis theory were the fields and not the mechanical models. Itwas Einstein who clearly recognized this fact fifty years laterwhen he declared that no ether existed and that the electro-magnetic fields were physical entities in their own right whichcould travel through empty space and could not be explainedmechanically.At the beginning of the twentieth century, then, physicistshad two successful theories which applied to different pheno-mena : Newton’s mechanics and Maxwell’s electrodynamics.Thus the Newtonian model had ceased to be the basis of allphysics.MODERN PHYSICSThe first three decades of our century changed the wholesituation in physics radically. Two separate developments-that of relativity theory and of atomic physics-shattered allthe principal concepts of the Newtonian world view: the notionof absolute space and time, the elementary solid particles, the61TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"62strictly causal nature of physical phenomena, and the ideal ofThean objective description of nature. None of these conceptsTao ofcould be extended to the new domains into which physics wasPhysicsnow penetrating.At the beginning of modern physics stands the extraordinaryintellectual feat of one man: Albert Einstein. In two articles,both published in 1905, Einstein initiated two revolutionarytrends of thought. One was his special theory of relativity,the other was a new way of looking at electromagnetic radiationwhich was to become characteristic of quantum theory, thetheory of atomic phenomena. The complete quantum theorywas worked out twenty years later by a whole team of physicists.Relativity theory, however, was constructed in its completeform almost entirely by Einstein himself. Einstein’s scientificpapers stand at the beginning of the twentieth century asimposing intellectual monuments-the pyramids of moderncivilization.Einstein strongly believed in nature’s inherent harmony andhis deepest concern throughout his scientific life was to find aunified foundation of physics. He began to move towards thisgoal by constructing a common framework for electrodynamicsand mechanics, the two separate theories of classical physics.This framework is known as the special theory of relativity. Itunified and completed the structure of classical physics, butat the same time it involved drastic changes in the traditionalconcepts of space and time and undermined one of thefoundations of the Newtonian world view.According to relativity theory, space is not three-dimensionaland time is not a separate entity. Both are intimately connectedand form a four-dimensional continuum, ‘space-time’. Inrelativity theory, therefore, we can never talk about spacewithout talking about time and vice versa. Furthermore, thereis no universal flow of time as in the Newtonian model. Differentobservers will order events differently in time if they movewith different velocities relative to the observed events. In sucha case, two events which are seen as occurring simultaneouslyby one observer may occur in different temporal sequencesfor other observers. All measurements involving space andtime thus lose their absolute significance. In relativity theory,the Newtonian concept of an absolute space as the stage of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"physical phenomena is abandoned and so is the concept ofan absolute time. Both space and time become merely elementsof the language a particular observer uses for his description ofthe phenomena.The concepts of space and time are so basic for the des-cription of natural phenomena that their modification entailsa modification of the whole framework that we use to describenature. The most important consequence of this modificationis the realization that mass is nothing but a form of energy.Even an object at rest has energy stored in its mass, and therelation between the two is given by the famous equationE= mc2, c being the speed of light.This constant c, the speed of light, is of fundamental im-portance for the theory of relativity. Whenever we describephysical phenomena involving velocities which approach thespeed of light, our description has to take relativity theory intoaccount. This applies in particular to electromagnetic pheno-mena, of which light is just one example and which led Einsteinto the formulation of his theory.In 1915, Einstein proposed his general theory of relativity inwhich the framework of the special theory is extended to includegravity, i.e. the mutual attraction of all massive bodies. Whereasthe special theory has been confirmed by innumerable experi-ments, the general theory has not yet been confirmed con-clusively. However, it is so far the most accepted, consistentand elegant theory of gravity and is widely used in astrophysicsand cosmology for the description of the universe at large.The force of gravity, according to Einstein’s theory, has theeffect of ‘curving’ space and time. This means that ordinaryEuclidean geometry is no longer valid in such a curved space,just as the two-dimensional geometry of a plane cannot beapplied on the surface of a sphere. On a plane, we can draw,for example, a square by marking off one metre on a straight line,making a right angle and marking off another metre, thenmaking another right angle and marking off another metre,and finally making a third right angle and marking off one metreagain, after which we are back at the starting point and thesquare is completed. On a sphere, however, this proceduredoes not work because the rules of Euclidean geometry do nothold on curved surfaces. In the same way, we can define a63TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"64three-dimensional curved space to be one in which EuclideanThegeometry is no longer valid. Einstein’s theory, now, says thatTao ofthree-dimensional space is actually curved, and that the curva-Physicsture is caused by the gravitational field of massive bodies.1.7,drawing a square on a plane and on a sphereWherever there is a massive object, e.g. a star or a planet, thespace around it is curved and the degree of curvature dependson the mass of the object. And as space can never be separatedfrom time in relativity theory, time as well is affected by thepresence of matter, flowing at different rates in different partsof the universe. Einstein’s general theory of relativity thuscompletely abolishes the concepts of absolute space andtime. Not only are all measurements involving space and timerelative; the whole structure of space-time depends on thedistribution of matter in the universe, and the concept of‘empty space’ loses its meaning.The mechanistic world view of classical physics was based onthe notion of solid bodies moving in empty space. This notionis still valid in the region that has been called the ‘zone ofmiddle dimensions’, that is, in the realm of our daily experiencewhere classical physics continues to be a useful theory. Bothconcepts-that of empty space and that of solid materialbodies-are deeply ingrained in our habits of thought, so it isextremely difficult for us to imagine a physical reality wherethey do not apply. And yet, this is precisely what modernphysics forces us to do when we go beyond the middle dimen-sions. ‘Empty space’ has lost its meaning in astrophysics andcosmology, the sciences of the universe at large, and the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"concept of solid objects was shattered by atomic physics, thescience of the infinitely small.At the turn of the century, several phenomena connectedwith the structure of atoms and inexplicable in terms of classicalphysics were discovered. The first indication that atoms hadsome structure came from the discovery of X-rays; a newradiation which rapidly found its now well known applicationin medicine. X-rays, however, are not the only radiation emittedby atoms. Soon after their discovery, other kinds of radiationwere discovered which are emitted by the atoms of so-calledradioactive substances. The phenomenon of radioactivity gavedefinite proof of the composite nature of atoms, showing thatthe atoms of radioactive substances not only emit varioustypes of radiation, but also transform themselves into atoms ofcompletely different substances.Besides being objects of intense study, these phenomenawere also used, in most ingenious ways, as new tools to probedeeper into matter than had ever been possible before. ThusMax von Laue used X-rays to study the arrangements of atomsin crystals, and Ernest Rutherford realized that the so-calledalpha particles emanating from radioactive substances werehigh-speed projectiles of subatomic size which could be usedto explore the interior of the atom. They could be fired atatoms, and from the way they were deflected one could drawconclusions about the atoms’ structure.When Rutherford bombarded atoms with these alphaparticles, he obtained sensational and totally unexpectedresults. Far from being the hard and solid particles they werebelieved to be since antiquity, the atoms turned out to consistof vast regions of space in which extremely small particles-theelectrons-moved around the nucleus, bound to it by electricforces. It is not easy to get a feeling for the order of magnitudeof atoms, so far is it removed from our macroscopic scale. Thediameter of an atom is about one hundred millionth of a centi-metre. In order to visualize this diminutive size, imagine anorange blown up to the size of the Earth. The atoms of theorange will then have the size of cherries. Myriads of cherries,tightly packed into a globe of the size of the Earth-that’s amagnified picture of the atoms in an orange.An atom, therefore, is extremely small compared to macro-65TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"66scopic objects, but it is huge compared to the nucleus in itsThecentre. In our picture of cherry-sized atoms, the nucleus of anTao ofatom will be so small that we will not be able to see it. If wePhysicsblew up the atom to the size of a football, or even to room size,the nucleus would still be too small to be seen by the nakedeye. To see the nucleus, we would have to blow up the atomto the size of the biggest dome in the world, the dome of StPeter’s Cathedral in Rome. In an atom of that size, the nucleuswould have the size of a grain of salt! A grain of salt in themiddle of the dome of St Peter’s, and specks of dust whirlingaround it in the vast space of the dome-this is how we canpicture the nucleus and electrons of an atom.Soon after the emergence of this ‘planetary’ model of theatom, it was discovered that the number of electrons in theatoms of an element determine the element’s chemical pro-perties, and today we know that the whole periodic table ofelements can be built up by successively adding protons andneutrons to the nucleus of the lightest atom-hydrogen*-andthe corresponding number of electrons to its atomic ‘shell’.The interactions between the atoms give rise to the variouschemical processes, so that all of chemistry can now in principlebe understood on the basis of the laws of atomic physics.These laws, however, were not easy to recognize. They werediscovered in the 1920s by an international group of physicistsincluding Niels Bohr from Denmark, Louis De Broglie fromFrance, Erwin Schrddinger and Wolfgang Pauli from Austria,Werner Heisenberg from Germany, and Paul Dirac fromEngland. These men joined their forces across all nationalborders and shaped one of the most exciting periods in modernscience, which brought man, for the first time, into contactwith the strange and unexpected reality of the subatomicworld. Every time the physicists asked nature a question in anatomic experiment, nature answered with a paradox, and themore they tried to clarify the situation, the sharper the paradoxesbecame. It took them a long time to accept the fact that theseparadoxes belong to the intrinsic structure of atomic physics,and to realize that they arise whenever one attempts todescribe atomic events in the traditional terms of physics.*The hydrogen atom consists of just one proton and one electron."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Once this was perceived, the physicists began to learn to askthe right questions and to avoid contradictions. In the wordsof Heisenberg, ‘they somehow got into the spirit of the quantumtheory’, and finally they found the precise and consistentmathematical formulation of this theory.The concepts of quantum theory were not easy to accepteven after their mathematical formulation had been completed.Their effect on the physicists’ imaginations was truly shattering.Rutherford’s experiments had shown that atoms, instead ofbeing hard and indestructible, consisted of vast regions ofspace in which extremely small particles moved, and nowquantum theory made it clear that even these particles werenothing like the solid objects of classical physics. The subatomicunits of matter are very abstract entities which have a dualaspect. Depending on how we look at them, they appearsometimes as particles, sometimes as waves; and this dualnature is also exhibited by light which can take the form ofelectromagnetic waves or of particles.This property of matter and of light is very strange. It seemsimpossible to accept that something can be, at the same time,a particle-i.e. an entity confined to a very small volume-and0a particlea wavea wave, which is spread out over a large region of space. Thiscontradiction gave rise to most of the koan-like paradoxeswhich finally led to the formulation of quantum theory. Thewhole development started when Max Planck discovered thatthe energy of heat radiation is not emitted continuously, butappears in the form of ‘energy packets’. Einstein called theseenergy packets ‘quanta’ and recognized them as a fundamentalaspect of nature. He was bold enough to postulate that lightand every other form of electromagnetic radiation can appearnot only as electromagnetic waves, but also in the form ofthese quanta. The light quanta, which gave quantum theoryits name, have since been accepted as bona fide particles andare now called photons. They are particles of a special kind,however, massless and always travelling with the speed oflight.67TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":")68TheTao ofPhysicsThe apparent contradiction between the particle and thewave picture was solved in a completely unexpected waywhich called in question the very foundation of the mechanisticworld view-the concept of the reality of matter. At the sub-atomic level, matter does not exist with certainty at definiteplaces, but rather shows ‘tendencies to exist’, and atomic eventsdo not occur with certainty at definite times and in definiteways, but rather show ‘tendencies to occur’. In the formalismof quantum theory, these tendencies are expressed as prob-abilities and are associated with mathematical quantitieswhich take the form of waves. This is why particles can bewaves at the same time. They are not ‘real’ three-dimensionalwaves like sound or water waves. They are ‘probability waves’,abstract mathematical quantities with all the characteristicproperties of waves which are related to the probabilities offinding the particles at particular points in space and at parti-cular times. All the laws of atomic physics are expressed interms of these probabilities. We can never predict an atomicevent with certainty; we can only say how likely it is to happen.Quantum theory has thus demolished the classical conceptsof solid objects and of strictly deterministic laws of nature. Atthe subatomic level, the solid material objects of classicalphysics dissolve into wave-like patterns of probabilities, andthese patterns, ultimately, do not represent probabilities ofthings, but rather probabilities of interconnections. A carefulanalysis of the process of observation in atomic physics hasshown that the subatomic particles have no meaning asisolated entities, but can only be understood as interconnectionsbetween the preparation of an experiment and the subsequentmeasurement. Quantum theory thus reveals a basic onenessof the universe. It shows that we cannot decompose the worldinto independently existing smallest units. As we penetrateinto matter, nature does not show us any isolated ‘basicbuilding blocks’, but rather appears as a complicated web ofrelations between the various parts of the whole. These re-lations always include the observer in an essential way. Thehuman observer constitutes the final link in the chain of ob-servational processes, and the properties of any atomic objectcan only be understood in terms of the object’s interactionwith the observer. This means that the classical ideal of an"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"objective description of nature is no longer valid. The Cartesianpartition between the I and the world, between the observerand the observed, cannot be made when dealing with atomicmatter. In atomic physics, we can never speak about naturewithout, at the same time, speaking about ourselves.The new atomic theory could immediately solve severalpuzzles which had arisen in connection with the structure ofatoms and could not be explained by Rutherford’s planetarymodel. First of all, Rutherford’s experiments had shown thatthe atoms making up solid matter consist almost entirely ofempty space, as far as the distribution of mass is concerned.But if all the objects around us, and we ourselves, consistmostly of empty space, why can’t we walk through closeddoors? In other words, what is it that gives matter its solidaspect?A second puzzle was the extraordinary mechanical stabilityof atoms. In the air, for example, atoms collide millions of timesevery second and yet go back to their original form after eachcollision. No planetary system following the laws of classicalmechanics would ever come out of these collisions unaltered.But an oxygen atom will always retain its characteristic con-figuration of electrons, no matter how often it collides withother atoms. This configuration, furthermore, is exactly thesame in all atoms of a given kind. Two iron atoms, and con-sequently two pieces of pure iron, are completely identical,no matter where they come from or how they have beentreated in the past.Quantum theory has shown that all these astonishing pro-perties of atoms arise from the wave nature of their electrons.To begin with, the solid aspect of matter is the consequence ofa typical ‘quantum effect’ connected with the dual wave/particleaspect of matter, a feature of the subatomic world which hasno macroscopic analogue. Whenever a particle is confined toa small region of space it reacts to this confinement by movingaround, and the smaller the region of confinement is, the fasterthe particle moves around in it. In the atom, now, there aretwo competing forces. On the one hand, the electrons arebound to the nucleus by electric forces which try to keep themas close as possible. On the other hand, they respond to theirconfinement by whirling around, and the tighter they are69TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"70bound to the nucleus, the higher their velocity will be; in fact,Thethe confinement of electrons in an atom results in enormousTao ofvelocities of about 600 miles per second! These high velocitiesPhysicsmake the atom appear as a rigid sphere, just as a fast rotatingpropeller appears as a disc. It is very difficult to compress atomsany further and thus they give matter its familiar solid aspect.In the atom, then, the electrons settle in orbits in such away that there is an optimal balance between the attractionof the nucleus and their reluctance to be confined. The atomicorbits, however, are very different from those of the planets inthe solar system, the difference arising from the wave natureof the electrons. An atom cannot be pictured as a smallplanetary system. Rather than particles circling around thenucleus, we have to imagine probability waves arranged indifferent orbits. Whenever we make a measurement, we willfind the electrons somewhere in these orbits, but we cannotsay that they are ‘going around the nucleus’ in the sense ofclassical mechanics.In the orbits, the electron waves have to be arranged insuch a way that ‘their ends meet’, i.e. that they form patternsknown as ‘standing waves’. These patterns appear wheneverwaves are confined to a finite region, like the waves in a vibratingguitar string, or in the air inside a flute (see diagram overleaf). It iswell known from these examples that standing waves canassume only a limited number of well-defined shapes. In the caseof the electron waves inside an atom, this means that they canexist only in certain atomic orbits with definite diameters. Theelectron of a hydrogen atom, for example, can only exist in acertain first, second or third orbit, etc., and nowhere in between.Under normal conditions, it will always be in its lowest orbit,called the ‘ground state’ of the atom. From there, the electroncan jump to higher orbits if it receives the necessary amount ofenergy, and then the atom is said to be in an ‘excited state’from which it will go back to its ground state after a while,the electron giving off the surplus energy in the form of aquantum of electromagnetic radiation, or photon. The statesof an atom, i.e. the shapes and mutual distances of its electronorbits, are exactly the same for all atoms with the same numberof electrons. This is why any two oxygen atoms, for example,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"standing-wave patterns in a vibrating stringwill be completely identical. They may be in different excitedstates, perhaps due to collisions with other atoms in the air,but after a while they will invariably return to exactly the sameground state. The wave nature of the electrons accounts thusfor the identity of atoms and for their great mechanicalstability.A further characteristic feature of atomic states is the factthat they can be completely specified by a set of integralnumbers, called ‘quantum numbers’, which indicate the loca-tion and shape of the electron orbits. The first quantum numberis the number of the orbit and determines the energy anelectron must have to be in that orbit; two more numbersspecify the detailed shape of the electron wave in the orbitand are related to the speed and orientation of the electron’s71TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"72rotation.* The fact that these details are expressed by integralThenumbers means that the electron cannot change its rotationTao ofcontinuously, but can only jump from one value to another,Physicsjust as it can only jump from one orbit to another. Again thehigher values represent excited states of the atom, the groundstate being the one where all the electrons are in the lowestpossible orbits and have the smallest possible amounts ofrotation.Tendencies to exist, particles reacting to confinement withmotion, atoms switching suddenly from one ‘quantum state’to another, and an essential interconnectedness of all pheno-mena-these are some of the unusual features of the atomicworld. The basic force, on the other hand, which gives rise toall atomic phenomena is familiar and can be experienced inthe macroscopic world. It is the force of electric attractionbetween the positively charged atomic nucleus and thenegatively charged electrons. The interplay of this force withthe electron waves gives rise to the tremendous variety ofstructures and phenomena in our environment. It is responsiblefor all chemical reactions, and for the formation of molecules,that is, of aggregates of several atoms bound to each other bymutual attraction. The interaction between electrons andatomic nuclei is thus the basis of all solids, liquids and gases,and also of all living organisms and of the biological processesassociated with them.In this immensely rich world of atomic phenomena, thenuclei play the role of extremely small, stable centres whichconstitute the source of the electric force and form theskeletons of the great variety of molecular structures. Tounderstand these structures, and most of the natural.pheno-mena around us, it is not necessary to know more about thenuclei than their charge and their mass. In order to understandthe nature of matter, however, to know what matter is ultimatelymade of, one has to study the atomic nuclei which containpractically all of its mass. In the 193Os, after quantum theoryhad unravelled the world of atoms, it was therefore the main*The ‘rotation’ of an electron in its orbit must not be understood in the classicalsense; it is determined by the shape of the electron wave in terms of theprobabilities for the particle’s existence in certain parts of the orbit."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"task of physicists to understand the structure of nuclei, theirconstituents and the forces which hold them together sotightly.The first important step towards an understanding of nuclearstructure was the discovery of the neutron as the secondconstituent of the nucleus, a particle which has roughly thesame mass as the proton (the first nuclear constituent)-abouttwo thousand times the mass of the electron-but does notcarry an electric charge. This discovery not only explainedhow the nuclei of all chemical elements were built up fromprotons and neutrons, but also revealed that the nuclear force,which kept these particles so tightly bound within the nucleus,was a completely new phenomenon. It could not be of electro-magnetic origin since the neutrons were electrically neutral.Physicists soon realized that they were here confronted with anew force of nature which does not manifest itself anywhereoutside the nucleus.An atomic nucleus is about one hundred thousand timessmaller than the whole atom and yet it contains almost all ofthe atom’s mass. This means that matter inside the nucleusmust be extremely dense compared to the forms of matterwe are used to. Indeed, if the whole human body were com-pressed to nuclear density it would not take up more spacethan a pinhead. This high density, however, is not the onlyunusual property of nuclear matter. Being of the same quantumnature as electrons, the ‘nucleons’-as the protons andneutrons are often called-respond to their confinement withhigh velocities, and since they are squeezed into a much smallervolume their reaction is all the m-ore violent. They race aboutin the nucleus with velocities of about 40,000 miles per second!Nuclear matter is thus a form of matter entirely’different fromanything we experience ‘up here’ in our macroscopic environ-ment. We can, perhaps, picture it best as tiny drops of anextremely dense liquid which is boiling and bubbling mostfiercely.The essential new aspect of nuclear matter which accountsfor all its unusual properties is the strong nuclear force, andthe feature that makes this force so unique is its extremelyshort range. It acts only when the nucleons come very nearto each other, that is, when their distance is about two to73TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"74three times their diameter. At such a distance, the nuclearTheforce is strongly attractive, but when the distance becomesTao ofless the force becomes strongly repulsive so that the nucleonsPhysicscannot approach each other any closer. In this way, the nuclearforce keeps the nucleus in an extremely stable, though extremelydynamic equilibrium.The picture of matter which emerges from the study ofatoms and nuclei shows that most of it is concentrated in tinydrops separated by huge distances. In the vast space betweenthe massive and fiercely boiling nuclear drops move theelectrons. These constitute only a tiny fraction of the totalmass, but give matter its solid aspect and provide the linksnecessary to build up the molecular structures. They are alsoinvolved in the chemical reactions and are responsible for thechemical properties of matter. Nuclear reactions, on the otherhand, generally do not occur naturally in this form of matterbecause the available energies are not high enough to disturbthe nuclear equilibrium.This form of matter, however, with its multitude of shapesand textures and its complicated molecular architecture, canexist only under very special conditions, when the temperatureis not too high, so that the molecules do not jiggle too much.When the thermal energy increases about a hundredfold, asit does in most stars, all atomic and molecular structures aredestroyed. Most of the matter in the universe exists, in fact, ina state which is very different from the one just described. Inthe centre of the stars exist large accumulations of nuclearmatter, and nuclear processes which occur only very rarely onearth predominate there. They are essential for the great varietyof stellar phenomena observed in astronomy, most of whicharise from a combination of nuclear and gravitational effects.For our planet, the nuclear processes in the centre of the Sunare of particular importance because they furnish the energywhich sustains our terrestrial environment. It has been one ofthe great triumphs of modern physics to discover that theconstant energy flow from the Sun, our vital link with theworld of the very large, is a result of nuclear reactions, ofphenomena in the world of the infinitely small.In the history of man’s penetration into this submicroscopic"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"world, a stage was reached in the early 1930s when scientiststhought they had now finally discovered the ‘basic buildingblocks’ of matter. It was known that all matter consisted ofatoms and that all atoms consisted of protons, neutrons andelectrons. These so-called ‘elementary particles’ were seen asthe ultimate indestructible units of matter: atoms in the Demo-critean sense. Although quantum theory implies, as mentionedpreviously, that we cannot decompose the world into in-dependently existing smallest units, this was not generallyperceived at that time. The classical habits of thought werestill so persistent that most physicists tried to understand matterin terms of its ‘basic building blocks’, and this trend of thoughtis, in fact, quite strong even today.Two further developments in modern physics have shown,however, that the notion of elementary particles as the primaryunits of matter has to be abandoned. One of these develop-ments was experimental, the other theoretical, and both beganin the 1930s. On the experimental side, new particles werediscovered as physicists refined their experimental techniquesand developed ingenious new devices for particle detection.Thus the number of particles increased from three to six by1935, then to eighteen by 1955, and today we know over twohundred ‘elementary’ particles. The two tables overleaf,taken from a recent publication,” show most of the particlesknown today. They illustrate convincingly that the adjective‘elementary’ is no longer very attractive in such a situation.As more and more particles were discovered over the years,it became clear that not all of them could be called ‘elementary’,and today there is a widespread belief among physicists thatnone of them deserves this name.This belief is enforced by the theoretical developmentswhich paralleled the discovery of an ever-increasing number ofparticles. Soon after the formulation of quantum theory, itbecame clear that a complete theory of nuclear phenomenamust not only be a quantum theory, but must also incorporaterelativity theory. This is because the particles confined todimensions of the size of nuclei often move so fast that theirspeed comes close to the speed of light. This fact is crucial forthe description of their behaviour, because every descriptionof natural phenomena involving velocities close to the speed75TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"76Meson TableTheTao ofPhysicsD (7701 1*(1-l-w (7.93) o-(1-)-* II (9001*H (953) +tl’ (9ssl 0+(0-l*6 (970) I-(0*).*\" (9901 O-(A I-Baryon TableApril ,914**.**n*r.a?**l *ì.a****t***it**t.**.*****.I**l****l **..II**lll*t*+.*1*a..la.**l ****/*::..If..l . .:l:1.1.Dead*‘I*/**a*.a*D.**r*.**::l *::...***.l **l *lLl *..****l *.*..***of light has to take relativity theory into account. It has to be,as we say, a ‘relativist/c’ description. What we need, therefore,for a full understanding of the nuclear world is a theory whichincorporates both quantum theory and relativity theory. Sucha theory has not yet been found, and therefore we have asyet been unable to formulate a complete theory of the nucleus.Although we know quite a lot about nuclear structure andabout the interactions between nuclear particles, we do notyet understand the nature and complicated form of thenuclear force on a fundamental level. There is no completetheory of the nuclear particle world comparable to quantumtheory for the atomic world. We do have several ‘quantum-relativistic’ models which describe some aspects of the worldof particles very well, but the fusion of quantum and relativitytheory into a complete theory of the particle world is still the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"central problem and great challenge of modern fundamentalphysics.Relativity theory has had a profound influence on our pictureof matter by forcing us to modify our concept of a particle inan essential way. In classical physics, the mass of an objecthad always been associated with an indestructible materialsubstance, with some ‘stuff’ of which all things were thoughtto be made. Relativity theory showed that mass has nothingto do with any substance, but is a form of energy. Energy,however, is a dynamic quantity associated with activity, orwith processes. The fact that the mass of a particle is equivalentto a certain amount of energy means that the particle canno longer be seen as a static object, but has to be conceivedas a dynamic pattern, a process involving the energy whichmanifests itself as the particle’s mass.This new view of particles was initiated by Dirac when heformulated a relativistic equation describing the behaviour ofelectrons. Dirac’s theory was not only extremely successful inaccounting for the fine details of atomic structure, but alsorevealed a fundamental symmetry between matter and anti-matter. It predicted the existence of an anti-electron with thesame mass as the electron but with an opposite charge. Thispositively charged particle, now called the positron, wasindeed discovered two years after Dirac had predicted it. Thesymmetry between matter and antimatter implies that forevery particle there exists an antiparticle with equal mass andopposite charge. Pairs of particles and antiparticles can becreated if enough energy is available and can be made toturn into pure energy in the reverse process of annihilation.These processes of particle creation and annihilation hadbeen predicted from Dirac’s theory before they were actuallydiscovered in nature, and since then they have been observedmillions of times.The creation of material particles from pure energy iscertainly the most spectacular effect of relativity theory, and itcan only be understood in terms of the view of particles out-lined above. Before relativistic particle physics, the constituentsof matter had always been considered as being either elementaryunits which were indestructible and unchangeable, or as com-77TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"78posite objects which could be broken up into their constituentTheparts; and the basic question was whether one could divideTao ofrnatter again and again, or whether one would finally arrive atPhysicssome smallest indivisible units. After Dirac’s discovery, thewhole question of the division of matter appeared in a newlight. When two particles collide with high energies, theygenerally break into pieces, but these pieces are not smallerthan the original particles. They are again particles of the samekind and are created out of the energy of motion (‘kineticenergy’) involved in the collision process. The whole problemof dividing matter is thus resolved in an unexpected sense.The only way to divide subatomic particles further is to bangthem together in collision processes involving high energies.This way, we can divide matter again and again, but we neverobtain smaller pieces because we just create particles out ofthe energy involved in the process. The subatomic particles arethus destructible and indestructible at the same time.This state of affairs is bound to remain paradoxical as longas we adopt the static view of composite ‘objects’ consistingof ‘basic building blocks’. Only when the dynamic, relativisticview is adopted does the paradox disappear. The particles arethen seen as dynamic patterns, or processes, which involve acertain amount of energy appearing to us as their mass. In acollision process, the energy of the two colliding particles isredistributed to form a new pattern, and if it has been increasedby a sufficient amount of kinetic energy, this new patternmay involve additional particles.High-energy collisions of subatomic particles are theprincipal method used by physicists to study the propertiesof these particles, and particle physics is therefore also called‘high-energy physics’.The kinetic energies required for thecollision experiments are achieved by means of huge particleaccelerators: enormous circular machines with circumferencesof several miles in which protons are accelerated to velocitiesnear the speed of light and are then made to collide with otherprotons or with neutrons. It is impressive that machines of*See photograph on pages 14-15, showing an aerial view of the acceleratorat Fermilab, near Batavia, Illinois, which has a circumference of four miles(photograph taken in 1971 while the laboratory was still under construction)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"that size are needed to study the world of the infinitely small.They are the supermicroscopes of our time.Most of the particles created in these collisions live for onlyan extremely short time-much less than a millionth of asecond-after which they disintegrate again into protons,neutrons and electrons. In spite of their exceedingly shortlifetime, these particles can not only be detected and theirproperties measured but are actually made to leave trackswhich can be photographed! These particle tracks are pro-duced in so-called bubble chambers in a manner similar tothe way a jet plane makes a trail in the sky. The actual particlesare many orders of magnitude smaller than the bubbles makingup the tracks, but from the thickness and curvature of a trackphysicists can identify the particle that caused it. The pictureoverleaf shows such bubble chamber tracks. The points fromwhich several tracks emanate are points of particle collisions,and the curves are caused by magnetic fields which theexperimenters use to identify the particles. The collisions ofparticles are our main experimental method to study theirproperties and interactions, and the beautiful lines, spirals andcurves traced by the particles in bubble chambers are thus ofparamount importance for modern physics.TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"80The high-energy scattering experiments of the past decadesThehave shown us the dynamic and ever-changing nature of theTao ofparticle world in the most striking way. Matter has appearedPhysicsin these experiments as completely mutable. All particles canbe transmuted into other particles; they can be created fromenergy and can vanish into energy. In this world, classicalconcepts like ‘elementary particle’, ‘material substance’ or‘isolated object’, have lost their meaning; the whole universeappears as a dynamic web of inseparable energy patterns. Sofar, we have not yet found a complete theory to describe thisworld of subatomic particles, but we do have several theoreticalmodels which describe certain aspects of it very well. None ofthese models is free from mathematical difficulties, and theyall contradict each other in certain ways, but all of them reflectthe basic unity and the intrinsically dynamic character ofmatter. They show that the properties of a particle can only beunderstood in terms of its activity-of its interaction with thesurrounding environment-and that the particle, therefore,cannot be seen as an isolated entity, but has to be understoodas an integrated part of the whole.Relativity theory has not only affected our conception ofparticles in a drastic way, but also our picture of the forcesbetween these particles. In a relativistic description of particleinteractions, the forces between the particles-that is theirmutual attraction or repulsion-are pictured as the exchangeof other particles. This concept is very difficult to visualize. It isa consequence of the four dimensional space-time character ofthe subatomic world and neither our intuition nor our languagecan deal with this image very well. Yet it is crucial for an under-standing of subatomic phenomena. It links the forces betweenconstituents of matter to the properties of other constituentsof matter, and thus unifies the two concepts, force and matter,which had seemed to be so fundamentally different ever sincethe Greek atomists. Both force and matter are now seen tohave their common origin in the dynamic patterns which wecall particles.The fact that particles interact through forces which manifestthemselves as the exchange of other particles is yet anotherreason why the subatomic world cannot be decomposed intoconstituent parts. From the macroscopic level down to the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"nuclear level, the forces which hold things together are relativelyweak and it is a good approximation to say that things consistof constituent parts. Thus a grain of salt can be said to consistof salt molecules, the salt molecules of two kinds of atoms,those atoms to consist of nuclei and electrons, and the nucleiof protons and neutrons. At the particle level, however, it isno longer possible to see things that way.In recent years, there has been an increasing amount ofevidence that the protons and neutrons, too, are compositeobjects; but the forces holding them together are so strongor-what amounts to the same-the velocities acquired by thecomponents are so high, that the relativistic picture has to beapplied, where the forces are also particles. Thus the distinctionbetween the constituent particles and the particles making upthe binding forces becomes blurred and the approximationof an object consisting of constituent parts breaks down.The particle world cannot be decomposed into elementarycomponents.In modern physics, the universe is thus experienced as a dynamic,inseparable whole which always includes the observer in anessential way. In this experience, ,the traditional concepts ofspace and time, of isolated objects, and of cause and effect,lose their meaning. Such an experience, however, is verysimilar to that of the Eastern mystics. The similarity becomesapparent in quantum and relativity theory, and becomes evenstronger in the ‘quantum-relativistic’ models of subatomicphysics where both these theories combine to produce themost striking parallels to Eastern mysticism.Before spelling out these parallels in detail, I shall give abrief account of the schools of Eastern philosophy which arerelevant to the comparison for the reader who is not familiarwith them. They are the various schools in the religious philo-sophies of Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism. In the followingfive chapters, the historical background, characteristic featuresand philosophical concepts of these spiritual traditions will bedescribed, the emphasis being on those aspects and conceptswhich will be important for the subsequent comparison withphysics.__-----81TheNewPhysics"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"II THEWAY OFEASTERNMYSTICISM"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"--.-_ --- _.------ _...~ --._ _.._..-.__- - .._ -~~,~"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"’ 5 HINDUISMFor an understanding of any of the philosophies to be des-cribed, it is important to realize that they are religious inessence. Their main aim is the direct mystical experience ofreality, and since this experience is religious by nature, theyare inseparable from religion. More than for any other Easterntradition this is true for Hinduism, where theconnection betweenphilosophy and religion is particularly strong. It has been saidthat almost all thought in India is in a sense religious thoughtand Hinduism has not only influenced, throughout manycenturies, India’s intellectual life, but almost completelydetermined her social and cultural life as well.Hinduism cannot be called a philosophy, nor is it a welldefined religion. It is, rather, a large and complex socio-religiousorganism consisting of innumerable sects, cults and philo-sophical systems and involving various rituals, ceremonies andspiritual disciplines, as well as the worship of countless gods andgoddesses. The many facets of this complex and yet persistentand powerful spiritual tradition mirror the geographical, racial,linguistic and cultural complexities of India’s vast subcontinent.The manifestations of Hinduism range from highly intellectualphilosophies involving conceptions of fabulous range anddepth to the nai’ve and childlike ritual practices of the masses.If the majority of the Hindus are simple villagers who keep thepopular religion alive in their daily worship, Hinduism has, onthe other hand, brought forth a large number of outstandingspiritual teachers to transmit its profound insights.The spiritual source of Hinduism lies in the Vedas, a collectionof ancient scriptures written by anonymous sages, the so-called Vedic ‘seers’. There are four Vedas, the oldest of them"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"86TheTao ofPhysicsbeing the Rig Veda. Written in ancient Sanskrit, the sacredlanguage of India, the Vedas have remained the highestreligious authority for most sections of Hinduism. In India,any philosophical system that does not accept the authorityof the Vedas is considered to be unorthodox.Each of these Vedas consists of several parts which werecomposed at different periods, probably between 1500 and500 B.C. The oldest parts are sacred hymns and prayers.Subsequent parts deal with sacrificial rituals connected withthe Vedic hymns, and the last, called the Upanishads, elaboratetheir philosophical and practical content. The Upanishadscontain the essence of Hinduism’s spiritual message. Theyhave guided and inspired India’s greatest minds for the lasttwenty-five centuries, in accordance with the advice given intheir verses :Taking as a bow the great weapon of the Upanishad,One should put upon it an arrow sharpened bymeditation.Stretching it with a thought directed to the essence ofThat,Penetrate that Imperishable as the mark, my friend.’The masses of the Indian people, however, have receivedthe teachings of Hinduism not through the Upanishads, butthrough a large number of popular tales, collected in hugeepics, which are the basis of the vast and colourful Indianmythology. One of those epics, the Mahabharata, containsIndia’s favourite religious text, the beautiful spiritual poem ofthe Bhagavad Gita. The Gita, as it is commonly called, is adialogue between the god Krishna and the warrior Arjuna whois in great despair, being forced to combat his own kinsmenin the great family war which forms the main story of theMahabharata. Krishna, disguised as Arjuna’s charioteer, drivesthe chariot right between the two armies and in this dramaticsetting of the battlefield he starts to reveal to Arjuna the mostprofound truths of Hinduism. As the god speaks, the realisticbackgrouna of the war between the two families soon fadesaway and it becomes clear that the battle of Arjuna is thespiritual battle of man, the battle of the warrior in search ofenlightenment. Krishna himself advises Arjuna:"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Kill therefore with the sword of wisdom the doubt born87of ignorance that lies in thy heart. Be one in self-harmony,Hinduismin Yoga, and arise, great warrior, arise.2The basis of Krishna’s spiritual instruction, as of all Hinduism,is the idea that the multitude of things and events around usare but different manifestations of the same ultimate reality.This reality, called Brahman, is the unifying concept whichgives Hinduism its essentially monistic character in spite of theworship of numerous gods and goddesses.Brahman, the ultimate reality, is understood as the ‘soul’,or inner essence, of all things. It is infinite and beyond allconcepts; it cannot be comprehended by the intellect, norcan it be adequately described in words: ‘Brahman, beginning-less, supreme: beyond what is and beyond what is not.‘3-‘Incomprehensible is that supreme Soul, unlimited, unborn,not to be reasoned about, unthinkable.‘4 Yet, people want totalk about this reality and the Hindu sages with their charac-teristic penchant for myth have pictured Brahman as divineand talk about it in mythological language. The various aspectsof the Divine have been given the names of the various godsworshipped by the Hindus, but the scriptures make it clearthat all these gods are but reflections of the one ultimatereality :This that people say, Worship this god! Worship thatgod!-one after another-this is his‘[Brahman’s] creationindeed! And he himself is all the gods.5The manifestation of Brahman in the human soul is calledAtman and the idea that Atman and Brahman, the individualand the ultimate reality, are one is the essence of the Upanishads:That which is the finest essence-this whole world has thatas its soul. That is Reality. That is Atman. That art thou.6The basic recurring theme in Hindu mythology is the creationof the world by the self-sacrifice of Cod-‘sacrifice’ in theoriginal sense of ‘making sacred’-whereby Cod becomes theworld which, in the end, becomes again God. This creativeactivity of the Divine is called Ma, the play of God, and theworld is seen as the stage of the divine play. Like most ofHindu mythology, the myth of Ma has a strong magical flavour."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"188TheTao ofPhysicsBrahman is the great magician who transforms himself into theworld and he performs this feat with his ‘magic creative power’,which is the original meaning of maya in the Rig Veda. Theword maya-one of the most important terms in Indianphilosophy-has changed’ its meaning over the centuries.From the ‘might’, or ‘power’, of the divine actor and magician,it came to signify the psychological state of anybody underthe spell of the magic play. As long as we confuse the myriadforms of the divine /i/a with reality, without perceiving theunity of Brahman underlying all these forms, we are under thespell of maya.Maya, therefore, does not mean that the world is an illusion,as is often wrongly stated. The illusion merely lies in our pointof view, if we think that the shapes and structures, things andevents, around us are realities of nature, instead of realizing thatthey are concepts of our measuring and categorizing minds.Maya is the illusion of taking these concepts for reality, ofconfusing the map with the territory.In the Hindu view of nature, then, all forms are relative, fluidand ever-changing maya, conjured up by the great magicianof the divine play. The world of maya changes continuously,because the divine /i/a is a rhythmic, dynamic play. The dynamicforce of the play is karma, another important concept ofIndian thought. Karma means ‘action’. It is the active principleof the play, the total universe in action, where everything isdynamically connected with everything else. In the words ofthe Cita, ‘Karma is the force of creation, wherefrom all thingshave their life.”The meaning of karma, like that of maya, has been broughtdown from its original cosmic level to the human level whereit has acquired a psychological sense. As long as our view ofthe world is fragmented, as long as we are under the spell ofmaya and think that we are separated from our environmentand can act independently, we are bound by karma. Beingfree from the bond of karma means to realize the unity andharmony of all nature, including man, and to act accordingly.The Cita is very clear on this point:All actions take place in time by the interweaving of theforces of nature, but the man lost in selfish delusion thinksthat he himself is the actor."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"But the man who knows the relation between the forcesof Nature and actions, sees how some forces of Naturework upon other forces of Nature, and becomes not theirslave.8To be free from the spell of maya, to break the bonds ofkarma means to realize that all the phenomena we perceivewith our senses are part of the same reality. It means to ex-perience, concretely and personally, that everything, includingour own self, is Brahman. This experience is called moksha, or‘liberation’ in Hindu philosophy and it is the very essence ofHinduism.Hinduism holds that there are innumerable ways of liberation.It would never expect all its followers to be able to approachthe Divine in the same way and therefore it provides differentconcepts, rituals and spiritual exercises for different modes ofawareness. The fact that many of these concepts or practicesare contradictory does not worry the Hindus in the least,because they know that Brahman is beyond concepts andimages anyway. From this attitude comes the great toleranceand inclusiveness which is characteristic of Hinduism.The most intellectual school is the Vedanta which is basedon the Upanishads and emphasizes Brahman as a nonpersonal,metaphysical concept, free from any mythological content.In spite of its high philosophical and intellectual level, however,the Vedantist way of liberation is very different from any schoolof Western philosophy, involving as it does daily meditationand other spiritual exercises to bring about the union withBrahman.Another important and influential method of liberation isknown as yoga, a word which means ‘to yoke’, ‘to join’, andwhich refers to the joining of the individual soul to Brahman.There are several schools, or ‘paths’ of yoga involving somebasic physical training and various mental disciplines designedfor people of different types and at different spiritual levels.For the common Hindu, the most popular way of approachingthe Divine is to worship it in the form of a personal god orgoddess, The fertile Indian imagination has created literallythousands of deities which appear in innumerable mani-festations.

As the Cosmic Dancer, Shiva is the god of creationand destruction who sustains through his dance the endlessrhythm of the universe.Vishnu, too, appears under many guises, one of them beingthe god Krishna of the Bhagavad Gita. In general, Vishnu’s roleis that of the preserver of the universe.

Contrary tomost Western religions, sensuous pleasure has never beensuppressed in Hinduism, because the body has always beenconsidered to be an integral part of the human being and notseparated from the spirit. The Hindu, therefore, does not tryto control the desires of the body by the conscious will, butaims at realizing himself with his whole being, body and mind.Hinduism has even developed a branch, the medieval Tantrism,where enlightenment is sought through a profound experienceof sensual love ‘in which each is both’, in accordance with thewords of the Upanishads:As a man, when in the embrace of a beloved wife, knowsnothing within or without, so this person, when in theembrace of the intelligent Soul, knows nothing within orwithout.qShiva was closely associated with this medieval form oferotic mysticism, and so were Shaktiand numerous other femaledeities which exist in great numbers in Hindu mythology.

As with Hinduism in India, it has had a strong influenceon the intellectual, cultural and artistic life of these countries.Unlike Hinduism, however, Buddhism goes back to a singlefounder, Siddhartha Gautama, the so-called ‘historic’ Buddha.He lived in India in the middle of the sixth century B.C., duringthe extraordinary period that saw the birth of so many spiritu-aland philosophical geniuses: Confucius and Lao Tzu in China,Zarathustra in Persia, Pythagoras and Heraclitus in Greece.If the flavour of Hinduism is mythological and ritualistic, thatof Buddhism is definitely psychological. The Buddha was notinterested in satisfying human curiosity about the origin ofthe world, the nature of the Divine, or similar questions. Hewas concerned exclusively with the human situation, with thesuffering and frustrations of human beings. His doctrine,therefore, was not one of metaphysics, but one of psycho-therapy. He pointed out the origin of human frustrations andthe way to overcome them, taking up for this purpose thetraditional Indian concepts of maya, karma, nirvana, etc., andgiving them a fresh, dynamic and directly relevant psychologicalinterpretation.After the Buddha’s death, Buddhism developed into twomain schools, the Hinayana and the Mahayana. The Hinayana,or Small Vehicle, is an orthodox school which sticks to the letterof the Buddha’s teaching, whereas the Mahayana, or GreatVehicle, shows a more flexible attitude, believing that the spiritof the doctrine is more important than its original formulation."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"94TheTao ofPhysicsThe Hinayana school established itself in Ceylon, Burma andThailand, whereas the Mahayana spread to Nepal, Tibet, China,and Japan and became, eventually, the more important of thetwo schools. In India itself, Buddhism was absorbed, after manycenturies, by the flexible and assimilative Hinduism, and theBuddha was finally adopted as an incarnation of the many-faced god Vishnu.As Mahayana Buddhism spread across Asia, it came intocontact with peoples of many different cultures and mentalitieswho interpreted the Buddha’s doctrine from their own pointof view, elaborating many of its subtle points in great detailand adding their own original ideas. In this way they keptBuddhism alive over the centuries and developed highlysophisticated philosophies with profound psychological in-sights.In spite of the high intellectual level of these philosophies,however, Mahayana Buddhism never loses itself in abstractspeculative thought. As always in Eastern mysticism, theintellect is seen merely as a means to clear the way for thedirect mystical experience, which Buddhists call the/awakening’.The essence of this experience is to pass beyond the world ofintellectual distinctions and opposites to reach the world ofacintya, the unthinkable, where reality appears as undividedand undifferentiated ‘suchness’.This was the experience Siddhartha Cautama had one night,after seven years of strenuous discipline in the forests. Sittingin deep meditation under the celebrated Bodhi Tree, the Treeof Enlightenment, he suddenly obtained the final and definiteclarification of all his searches and doubts in the act of ‘un-excelled, complete awakening’ which made him the Buddha,that is, ‘the Awakened’. For the Eastern world, the Buddha’simage in the state of meditation is as significant as the imageof the crucified Christ for the West, and has inspired countlessartists all over Asia who have created magnificent sculpturesof meditating Buddhas.According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha went to the DeerPark of Benares immediately after his awakening to preach hisdoctrine to his former fellow hermits.

Suffering arises, in theBuddhist view, whenever we resist the flow of life and try tocling to fixed forms which are all maya, whether they arethings, events, people or ideas. This doctrine of impermanenceincludes also the notion that there is no ego, no self which isthe persistent subject of our varying experiences. Buddhismholds that the idea of a separate individual self is an illusion,just another form of maya, an intellectual concept which hasno reality. To cling to this concept leads to the same frustrationas adherence to any other fixed category of thought.The Second Noble Truth deals with the cause of all suffering,trishna, which is clinging, or grasping. It is the futile graspingof life based on a wrong point of view which is called aviciya,or ignorance, in Buddhist philosophy. Out of this ignorance,we divide the perceived world into individual and separatethings and thus attempt to confine the fluid forms of reality infixed categories created by the mind. As long as this viewprevails, we are bound to experience frustration after frustra-tion. Trying to cling to things which we see as firm and per-sistent, but which in fact are transient and ever-changing, weare trapped in a vicious circle where every action generatesfurther action and the answer to each question poses newquestions. This vicious circle is known in Buddhism as samsara,the round of birth-and-death, and it is driven by karma, thenever-ending chain of cause and effect.The Third Noble Truth states that the suffering and frustrationcan be ended. It is possible to transcend the vicious circle ofsamsara, to free oneself from the bondage of karma, and toreach a state of total liberation called nirvana.

His statements about the world were confinedto emphasizing the impermanence of all ‘things’. He insistedon freedom from spiritual authority, including his own, sayingthat he could only show the way to Buddhahood, and that itwas up to every individual to tread this way to the end throughhis or her own efforts. The Buddha’s last words on his deathbedare characteristic of his world view and of his attitude as ateacher. ‘Decay is inherent in all compounded things,’ he saidbefore passing away; ‘Strive on with diligence.‘*In the first few centuries after the Buddha’s death, severalGreat Councils were held by the leading monks of the Buddhistorder at which the entire teaching was recited aloud anddifferences in interpretation were settled. At the fourth ofthese councils, which took place on the island of Ceylon (SriLanka) in the first century A.D., the memorized doctrine, whichhad been passed on orally for more than five hundred years, wasfor the first time recorded in writing. This record, written in thePali language, is known as the Pali Canon and forms the basis ofthe orthodox Hinayana school.

These rangefrom doctrines emphasizing religious faith in the teachings ofthe Buddha, to elaborate philosophies involving conceptswhich come very close to modern scientific thought.The first expounder of the Mahayana doctrine, and one ofthe deepest thinkers among the Buddhist patriarchs, wasAshvaghosha, who lived in” the first century A.D. He spelledout the fundamental thoughts of Mahayana Buddhism-inparticular those relating to the Buddhist concept of ‘suchness’-in a small book called The Awakening of Faith. This lucid andextremely beautiful text, which reminds one of the BhagavadGita in many ways, constitutes the first representative treatiseon the Mahayana doctrine and has become a principalauthority for all schools of Mahayana Buddhism.Ashvaghosha probably had a strong influence on Nagarjuna,the most intellectual Mahayana philosopher, who used a highlysophisticated dialectic to show the limitations of all conceptsof reality. With brilliant arguments he demolished the meta-physical propositions of his time and thus demonstrated thatreality, ultimately, cannot be grasped with concepts and ideas.Hence, he gave it the name sunyata, ‘the void’, or ‘emptiness’,a term which is equivalent to Ashvaghosha’s tathata, or ‘such-ness’; when the futility of all conceptual thinking is recognized,reality is experienced as pure suchness.Nagarjuna’s statement that the essential nature of realityis emptiness is thus far from being the nihilist statement forwhich it is often taken. It merely means that all concepts aboutreality formed by the human mind are ultimately void. Reality,or Emptiness, itself is not a state of mere nothingness, but isthe very source of all life and the essence of all forms.The views of Mahayana Buddhism presented so far reflectits intellectual, speculative side. This, however, is only oneside of Buddhism. Complementary to it is the Buddhist’sreligious consciousness which involves faith, love and com-passion.True enlightened wisdom (bodhi) is seen in theMahayana as being composed of two elements which D. T.97Buddhism"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"I98Suzuki has called the ‘two pillars supporting the great edificeTheof Buddhism’. They are prajna, which is transcendental wisdom,Tao ofor intuitive intelligence, and Karuna, which is love or corn-Physicspassion.Accordingly, the essential nature of all things is describedin Mahayana Buddhism not only by the abstract metaphysicalterms Suchness and Void, but also by the term Dharmakaya,the ‘Body of Being’, which describes reality as it appears to theBuddhist’s religious consciousness. The Dharmakaya is similarto the Brahman in Hinduism. It pervades all material things inthe universe and is also reflected in the human mind as bodhi,the enlightened wisdom. It is thus spiritual and material at thesame time.The emphasis on love and compassion as essential parts ofwisdom has found its strongest expression in the ideal of theBodhisattva, one of the characteristic developments ofMahayana Buddhism. A Bodhisattva is a highly evolved humanbeing on the way to becoming a Buddha, who is not seeking en-lightenment for himself alone, but has vowed to help all otherbeings achieve Buddhahood before he enters into nirvana. Theorigin of this idea lies in the decision of the Buddha-presentedin Buddhist tradition as a conscious and not at all easy decision-not simply to enter nirvana, but to return to the world in orderto show the path to salvation to his fellow human beings. TheBodhisattva ideal is also consistent with the Buddhist doctrineof non-ego, because if there is no separate individual self, theidea of one individual entering nirvana alone obviously doesnot make much sense.The element of faith, finally, is emphasized in the so-calledPure Land school of Mahayana Buddhism. The basis of thisschool is the Buddhist doctrine that the original nature of allhuman beings is that of a Buddha, and it holds that in orderto enter nirvana, or the ‘Pure Land’, all one has to do is tohave faith in one’s original Buddha nature.The culmination of Buddhist thought has been reached, accord-ing to many authors, in the so-called Avatamsaka school whichis based on the sutra of the same name. This sutra is regardedas the core of Mahayana Buddhism and is praised by Suzukiin the most enthusiastic words:"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"As to the Avatamsaka-sutra, it is really the consummationof Buddhist thought, Buddhist sentiment, and Buddhistexperience.

It is the eternal fountain of life fromwhich no religious mind will turn back athirst or onlypartially satisfied.399BuddhismIt was this sutra which stimulated Chinese and Japaneseminds more than anything else, when Mahayana Buddhismspread across Asia. The contrast between the Chinese andJapanese, on the one hand, and the Indians, on the other, isso great that they have been said to represent two poles ofthe human mind. Whereas the former are practical, pragmaticand socially minded, the latter are imaginative, metaphysicaland transcendental. When the Chinese and Japanese philo-sophers began to translate and interpret the Avatamsaka, oneof the greatest scriptures produced by the Indian religiousgenius, the two poles combined to form a new dynamic unityand the outcome were the ha-yen philosophy in China andthe Kegon philosophy in Japan which constitute, accordingto Suzuki, ‘the climax of Buddhist thought which has beendeveloping in the Far East for the last two thousand years’.4The central theme of the Avatamsaka is the unity and inter-relation of all things and events; a conception which is not onlythe very essence of the Eastern world view, but also one of thebasic elements of the world view emerging from modernphysics.

In this ancient culture, philosophical thought hadreached its culmination during the late Chou period (c. 500-221B.C.), the golden age of Chinese philosophy, and from then onhad always been held in the highest esteem.From the beginning, this philosophy had two complementaryaspects. The Chinese being practical people with a highlydeveloped social consciousness, all their philosophical schoolswere concerned, in one way or the other, with life in society,with human relations, moral values and government. This,however, is only one aspect of Chinese thought. Complementaryto it is that corresponding to the mystical side of the Chinesecharacter, which demanded that the highest aim of philosophyshould be to transcend the world of society and everyday lifeand to reach a higher plane of consciousness. This is the planeof the sage, the Chinese ideal of the enlightened man who hasachieved mystical union with the universe.The Chinese sage, however, does not dwell exclusively onthis high spiritual plane, but is equally concerned with worldlyaffairs. He unifies in himself the two complementary sides ofhuman nature-intuitive wisdom and practical knowledge,contemplation and social action-which the Chinese haveassociated with the images of the sage and of the king. Fullyrealized human beings, in the words of Chuang Tzu, ‘by theirstillness become sages, by their movement kings’.’During the sixth century B.C., the two sides of Chinesephilosophy developed into two distinct philosophical schools,-_"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"102TheTao ofPhysicsConfucianism and Taoism. Confucianism was the philosophyof social organization, of common sense and practical know’-ledge. It provided Chinese society with a system of educationand with strict conventions of social etiquette. One of its mainpurposes was to form an ethical basis for the traditional Chinesefamily system with its complex structure and its rituals ofancestor worship. Taoism, on the other hand, was concernedprimarily with the observation of nature and the discovery ofits Way, or Tao. Human happiness, according to the Taoists,is achieved when men follow the natural order, acting spon-taneously and trusting their intuitive knowledge.These two trends of thought represent opposite poles inChinese philosophy, but in China they were always seen aspoles of one and the same human nature, and thus as com-plementary. Confucianism was generally emphasized in theeducation of children who had to learn the rules and con-ventions necessary for life in society, whereas Taoism used tobe pursued by older people in order to regain and develop theoriginal spontaneity which had been destroyed by socialconventions. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Neo-Confucian school attempted a synthesis of Confucianism,Buddhism and Taoism, which culminated in the philosophy ofChu Hsi, one of the greatest of all Chinese thinkers. Chu Hsiwas an outstanding philosopher who combined Confucianscholarship with a deep understanding of Buddhism andTaoism, and incorporated elements of all three traditions inhis philosophical synthesis.Confucianism derives its name from Kung Fu Tzu, or Confucius,a highly influential teacher with a large number of studentswho saw his main function as transmitting the ancient culturalheritage to his disciples. In doing so, however, he went beyonda simple transmission of knowledge for he interpreted thetraditional ideas according to his own moral concepts. Histeachings were based on the so-called Six Classics, ancientbooks of philosophical thought, rituals, poetry, music andhistory, which represented the spiritual and cultural heritageof the ‘holy sages’ of China’s past. Chinese tradition hasassociated Confucius with all of these works, either as author,"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"commentator or editor; but according to modern scholarshiphe was neither the author, commentator, nor even the editorof any of the Classics. His own ideas became known throughthe Lun Yij, or Confucian Analects, a collection of aphorismswhich was compiled by some of his disciples.The originator of Taoism was Lao Tzu, whose name literallymeans the ‘Old Master’ and who was, according to tradition,an older contemporary of Confucius. He is said to have beenthe author of a short book of aphorisms which is consideredas the main Taoist scripture. In China, it is generally just calledthe Lao-tzu and in the West it is usually known as the Tao TeChing, the ‘Classic of the Way and Power’, a name which wasgiven to it in later times. I have already mentioned the para-doxical style and the powerful and poetic language of thisbook which Joseph Needham considers to be ‘without exceptionthe most profound and beautiful work in the Chinese language’.*The second important Taoist book is the Chuang-tzu, amuch larger book than the Tao Te Ching, whose author,Chuang Tzu, is said to have lived about two hundred yearsafter Lao Tzu. According to modern scholarship, however, theChuang-tzu, and probably also the Lao-tzu, cannot be seen asthe work of a single author, but rather constitute a collectionof Taoist writings compiled by different authors at differenttimes.Both the Confucian Analects and the Tao Te Ching are writtenin the compact suggestive style which is typical of the Chineseway of thinking. The Chinese mind was not given to abstractlogical thinking and developed a language which is verydifferent from that which evolved in the West. Many of itswords could be used as nouns, adjectives or verbs, and theirsequence was determined not so much by grammatical rulesas by the emotional content of the sentence. The classicalChinese word was very different from an abstract sign repre-senting a clearly delineated concept. It was rather a soundsymbol which had strong suggestive powers, bringing to mindan indeterminate complex of pictoriai images and emotions.The intention of the speaker was not so much to express anintellectual idea, but rather to affect and influence the listener.103ChineseThought"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"104Correspondingly, the written character was not just an abstractThesign, butLvas an organic pattern-a ‘gestalt’-which preserved/Tao ofthe full complex of images and the suggestive power of thePhysicsword.Since the Chinese philosophers expressed themselves in alanguage which was so well suited for their way of thinking,their writings and sayings could be short and inarticulate, andyet rich in suggestive images. It is clear that much of thisimagery must be lost in an English translation. A translation ofa sentence from the Tao Te Ching, for example, can onlyrender a small part of the rich complex of ideas contained inthe original, which is why different translations from thiscontroversial book often look like totally different texts. AsFung Yu-Lan has said, ‘It needs a combination of all the trans-lations already made and many others not yet made, to revealthe richness of the Lao-&u and the Confucian Analects intheir original form.‘3The Chinese, like the Indians, believed that there is an ultimatereality which underlies and unifies the multiple things andevents we observe:There are the three terms-‘complete’, ‘all-embracing’,‘the whole’. These names are different, but the realitysought in them is the same: referring to the One thing.4They called this reality the Tao, which originally meant ‘theWay’. It is the way, or process, of the universe, the order ofnature. In later times, the Confucianists gave it a differentinterpretation. They talked about the Tao of man, or the Taoof human society, and ‘understood it as the right way of lifein a inoral sense.In its original cosmic sense, the Tao is the ultimate, undeftn-able reality and as such it is the equivalent of the HinduistBrahman and the Buddhist Dharmakaya. It differs from theseIndian concepts, however, by its intrinsically dynamic qualitywhich, in the Chinese view, is the essence of the universe. TheTao is the cosmic process in which all things are involved;the world is seen as a continuous flow and change.Indian Buddhism, with its doctrine of impermanence, had"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"quite a similar view, but it took this view merely as the basicpremise of the, human situation and went on to elaborate itspsychological consequences. The Chinese, on the other hand,not only believed that flow and change were the essentialfeatures of nature, but also that there are constant patterns inthese changes, to be observed- by man. The sage recognizesthese patterns and directs his actions according to them. Inthis way, he becomes ‘one with the fao’, living in harmonywith nature and succeeding in everything he undertakes. Inthe words of Huai Nan Tzu, a philosopher of the second centuryB.C. :He who conforms to the course of the Tao, following thenatural processes of Heaven and Earth, finds it easy tomanage the whole world.5What, then, are the patterns of thecosmic Way which manhas to recognize? The principal characteristic of the Tao is thecyclic nature of its ceaseless motion and change. ‘Returningis the motion of the Tao,’ says Lao Tzu, and ‘Going far meansreturning.‘6 The idea is that all developments in nature, thosein the physical world as well as those of human situations,show cyclic patterns of coming and going, of expansion andcontraction.This idea was no doubt deduced from the movements ofthe sun and moon and from the change of the seasons, but itwas then also taken as a rule of life. The Chinese believe thatwhenever a situation develops to its extreme, it is bound toturn around and become its opposite. This basic belief hasgiven them courage and perseverence in times of distress andhas made them cautious and modest in times of success. Ithas led to the doctrine of the golden mean in which bothTaoists and Confucianists believe. ‘The sage’, says Lao Tzu,‘avoids excess, extravagance and indulgence.”In the Chinese view, it is better to have too little than to havetoo much, and better to leave things undone than to overdothem, because although one may not get very far this wayone is certain to go in the right direction.

Modern industrialsociety which is continuously trying to increase the ‘standardof living’ and thereby decreases the quality of life for all itsmembers is an eloquent illustration of this ancient Chinesewisdom.The idea of cyclic patterns in the motion of the Tao wasgiven a definite structure by the introduction of the polaropposites yin and yang. They are the two poles which set thelimits for the cycles of change:The yang having reached its climax retreats in favour ofthe yin; the yin having reached its climax retreats in favourof the yang.8In the Chinese view, all manifestations of the Tao aregenerated by the dynamic interplay of these two polar forces.This idea is very old and many generations worked on thesymbolism of the archetypal pair yin and yang until it becamethe fundamental concept of Chinese thought. The originalmeaning of the words yin and yang was that of the shady andsunny sides of a mountain, a meaning which gives a good ideaof the relativity of the two concepts:That which lets now the dark, now the light appear isTao.gFrom the very early times, the two archetypal poles of naturewere represented not only by bright and dark, but also by maleand female, firm and yielding, above and below. Yang, thestrong, male, creative power, was associated with Heaven,whereas yin, the dark, receptive, female and maternal element,was represented by the Earth. Heaven is above and full ofmovement, the Earth-in the old geocentric view-is belowand resting, and thus yang came to symbolize movement andyin rest.

Each hexagramconsists of six lines which may be either broken (yin) or un-broken (yang), the sixty-four of them constituting all possiblecombinations of that kind.

The body is divided into yin and yangparts. Globally speaking, the inside of the body is yang, thebody surface is yin; the back is yang, the front is yin; insidethe body, there are yin and yang organs. The balance betweenall these parts is maintained by a continuous flow of ch’i, orvital energy, along a system of ‘meridians’ <which contain theacupuncture points.

It isbased on the firm belief that the human intellect can nevercomprehend the Tao. In the words of Chuang Tzu,The most extensive knowledge does not necessarily knowit; reasoning will not make men wise in it. The sageshave decided against both these methods.’Chuang Tzu’s book is full of passages reflecting the Taoist’scontempt of reasoning and argumentation. Thus he says,A dog is not reckoned good because he barks well, and aman is not reckoned wise because he speaks skilfully.2andDisputation is a proof of not seeing clearly.3Logical reasoning was considered by the Taoists as part of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"114the artificial world of man, together with social etiquette andThemoral standards. They were not interested in this world at all,Tao ofbut concentrated their attention fully on the observation ofPhysicsnature in order to discern the ‘characteristics of the Tao’.Thus they developed an attitude which was essentially scientificand only their deep mistrust in the analytic method preventedthem from constructing proper scientific theories. Nevertheless,the careful observation of nature, combined with a strongmystical intuition, led the Taoist sages to profound insightswhich are confirmed by modern scientific theories.One of the most important insights of the Taoists was therealization that transformation and change are essential featuresof nature. A passage in the Chuang-tzu shows clearly how thefundamental importance of change was discerned by observingthe organic world:In the transformation and growth of all things, every budand feature has its proper form. In this we have theirgradual maturing and decay, the constant flow of trans-formation and change.4The Taoists saw all changes in nature as manifestations ofthe dynamic interplay between the polar opposites yin andyang, and thus they came to believe that any pair of oppositesconstitutes a polar relationship where each of the two poles isdynamically linked to the other. For the Western mind, thisidea of the implicit unity of all opposites is extremely difficult toaccept. It seems most paradoxical to us that experiences andvalues which we had always believed to be contrary shouldbe, after all, aspects of the same thing. In the East, however,it has always been considered as essential for attaining en-lightenment to go ‘beyond earthly opposites’,5 and in Chinathe polar relationship of all opposites lies at the very basis ofTaoist thought. Thus Chuang Tzu says,The ‘this’ is also ‘that’. The ‘that’ is also ‘this’ . . . That the‘that’ and the ‘this’ cease to be opposites is the veryessence of Tao. Only this essence, an axis as it were, isthe centre of the circle responding to the endless changes.6From the notion that the movements of the Tao are a_"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"continuous interplay between opposites, the Taoists deducedtwo basic rules for human conduct. Whenever you want toachieve anything, they said, you should start with its opposite.Thus Lao Tzu:In order to contract a thing, one should surely expand itfirst.In order to weaken, one will surely strengthen first.In order to overthrow, one will surely exalt first.‘In order to take, one will surely give first.’This is called subtle wisdom.’On the other hand, whenever you want to retain anything,you should admit in it something of its opposite:Be bent, and you will remain straight.Be vacant, and you will remain full.Be worn, and you will remain new.8This is the way of life of the sage who has reached a higherpoint of view, a perspective from which the relativity and polarrelationship of all opposites are clearly perceived. Theseopposites include, first and foremost, the concepts of goodand bad which are interrelated in the same way as yin andyang. Recognizing the relativity of good and bad, and thus ofaI! moral standards, the Taoist sage does not strive for thegood but rather tries to maintain a dynamic balance betweengood and bad. Chuang Tzu is very clear on this point:The sayings, ‘Shall we not follow and honour the rightand have nothing to do with the wrong?’ and ‘Shall we notfollow and honour those who secure good governmentand have nothing to do with those who produce disorder?show a want of acquaintance with the principles ofHeaven and Earth and with the different qualities of things.It is like following and honouring Heaven and taking noaccount of Earth; it is like following and honouring theyin and taking no account of the.yang.

This Greek Taoist’ wasHeraclitus of Ephesus. He shared with Lao Tzu not only theemphasis on continuous change, which he expressed in hisfamous saying ‘Everything flows’, but also the notion that allchanges are cyclic. He compared the world order to ‘an ever-living fire, kindling in measures and going out in measures’,1oan image which is indeed very similar to the Chinese idea ofthe Tao manifesting itself in the cyclic interplay of yin andyang-It is easy to see how the concept of change as a dynamicinterplay of opposites led Heraclitus, like Lao Tzu, to the dis-covery that all opposites are polar and thus united.

Heraclitus is often mentioned in connection withmodern physics, but hardly ever in connection with Taoism.And yet it is this connection which shows best that his worldview was that of a mystic and thus, in my opinion, puts theparallels between his ideas and those of modern physics in theright perspective.When we talk about theTaoist concept of change, it is importantto realize that this change is not seen as occurring as a con-sequence of some force, but rather as a tendency which isinnate in all things and situations.

Inthe words of Huai Nan Tzu,Those who follow the natural order flow in the current ofthe Tao.14Such a way of acting is called wu-wei in Taoist philosophy; aterm which means literally ‘non-action’, and which JosephNeedham translates as ‘refraining from activity contrary tonature’, justifying this interpretation with a quotation from theChuang-tzu :Non-action does not mean doing nothing and keepingsilent. Let everything be allowed to do what it naturallydoes, so that its nature will be satisfied.15If one refrains from acting contrary to nature or, as Needhamsays, from ‘going against the grain of things’, one is in harmonywith the Tao and thus one’s actions will be successful.

On the one hand, the trans-lation of the Buddhist sutras stimulated Chinese thinkers and.led them to interpret the teachings of the Indian Buddha inthe light of their own philosophies. Thus arose an immenselyfruitful exchange of ideas which culminated, as already men-tioned, in the Hua-yen (Sanskrit: Avatamsaka) school of Buddhismin China and in the Kegon school in Japan.On the other hand, the pragmatic side of the Chinesementality responded to the impact of Indian Buddhism byconcentrating on its practical aspects and developing theminto a special kind of spiritual discipline which was given thename Clan, a word usually translated as meditation. ThisClan philosophy was eventually adopted by Japan, aroundA.D. 1200, and has been cultivated there, under the name ofZen, as a living tradition up to the present day.Zen is thus a unique blend of the philosophies and idio-syncrasies of three different cultures. It is a way of life which istypically Japanese, and yet it reflects the mysticism of India,the Taoists’ love of naturalness and spontaneity and thethorough pragmatism of the Confucian mind.In spite of its rather special character, Zen is purely Buddhistic.in its essence, because its aim is no other than that of theBuddha himself: the attainment of enlightenment, an ex-perience known in Zen as satori.

The rest of thedoctrine, as expounded in the voluminous sutras, is seen assupplementary.The experience of Zen is thus the experience of satori, andsince this experience, ultimately, transcends all categories ofthought, Zen is not interested in any abstraction or con-ceptualization. It has no special doctrine or philosophy, noformal creeds or dogmas, and it asserts that this freedom fromall fixed beliefs makes it truly spiritual.More than any other school of Eastern mysticism, Zen is con-vinced that words can never express the ultimate truth. Itmust have inherited this conviction from Taoism, whichshowed the same uncompromising attitude. ‘If one asks aboutthe Tao and another answers him,’ said Chuang Tzu, ‘neitherof them knows it.”Yet the Zen experience can be passed on from teacher topupil, and it has, in fact, been transmitted for many centuriesby special methods proper to Zen. In a classic summary offour lines, Zen is described asA special transmission outside the scriptures,Not founded upon words and letters,Pointing directly to the human mind,Seeing into one’s nature and attaining Buddhahood.This technique of ‘direct pointing’ constitutes the specialflavour of Zen. It is typical of the Japanese mind which is moreintuitive than intellectual and likes to give out facts as factswithout much comment. The Zen masters were not given toverbosity and despised all theorizing and speculation. Thusthey developed methods of pointing directly to the truth, withsudden and spontaneous actions or words, which expose theparadoxes of conceptual thinking and, like the koans I havealready mentioned, are meant to stop the thought process tomake the student ready for the mystical experience. Thistechnique is well illustrated by the following examples of short"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"conversations between master and disciple. In these conver-sations, which make up most of the Zen literature, the masterstalk as little as possible and use their words to shift the disciples’attention from abstract thoughts to the concrete reality.A monk, asking for instruction, said to Bodhidharma: ‘Ihave no peace of mind. Please pacify my mind.’‘Bring your mind here before me’, replied Bodhidharma,‘and I will pacify it !’‘But when I seek my own mind,’ said the monk, ‘I cannotfind it.’‘There!’ snapped Bodhidharma, ‘I have pacified yourmind !‘2A monk told Joshu: ‘I have just entered the monastery.Please teach me.’Joshu asked: ‘Have you eaten your rice porridge?The monk replied: ‘I have eaten.’Joshu said: Then you had better wash your bowl.‘3These dialogues bring out another aspect which is character-istic of Zen. Enlightenment in Zen does not mean withdrawalfrom the world but means, on the contrary, active participationin everyday affairs. This viewpoint appealed very much to theChinese mentality which attached great importance to apractical, productive life and to the idea of family perpetuation,and could not accept the monastic character of Indian Buddhism.The Chinese masters always stressed that Wan, or Zen, is ourdaily experience, the ‘everyday mind’ as Ma-tsu proclaimed.Their emphasis was on awakening in the midst of everydayaffairs and they made it clear that they saw everyday life notonly as the way to enlightenment, but as enlightenment itself.In Zen, satori means the immediate experience of the Buddhanature of all things. First and foremost among these things arethe objects, affairs and people involved in everyday life, sothat while it emphasizes life’s practicalities, Zen is neverthelessprofoundly mystical.

When Po-chang was asked todefine Zen, he said, When hungry eat, when tired sleep.’Although this sounds simple and obvious, like so much in Zen,it is in fact quite a difficult task. To regain the naturalness ofour original nature requires long training and constitutes agreat spiritual achievement. In the words of a famous Zensaying,Before you study Zen, mountains are mountains and riversare rivers; while you are studying Zen, mountains are nolonger mountains and rivers are no longer rivers; but onceyou have had enlightenment, mountains are once againmountains and rivers again rivers.Zen’s emphasis on naturalness and spontaneity certainlyshows its Taoist roots, but the basis for this emphasis is strictlyBuddhistic. It is the belief in the perfection of our original nature,the realization that the process of enlightenment consistsmerely in becoming what we already are from the beginning.When the Zen master Po-chang was asked about seeking forthe Buddha nature he answered, ‘It’s much like riding an ox insearch of the ox.’There are two principal schools of Zen in Japan today whichdiffer in their methods of teaching. The Rinzai or ‘sudden’school uses the koan method, as discussed in a previouschapter, and gives prominence to periodic formal interviewswith the master, called sanzen, during which the student isasked to present his view of the koan he is trying to solve.The solving of a koan involves long periods of intense con-centration leading up to the sudden insight of satori.

The correctposture and breathing involved in this form of meditation isthe first thing every student of Zen has to learn. In Rinzdi Zen,zazen is used to prepare the intuitive mind for the handling ofthe koan, and the Soto school considers it as the most im-portant means to help the student mature and evolve towardssatori. More than that, it is seen as the actual realization ofone’s Buddha nature; body and mind being fused into aharmonious unity which needs no further improvement. As aZen poem says,Sitting quietly, doing nothing,Spring comes, and the grass grows by itself.6Since Zen asserts that enlightenment manifests itself in every-day affairs, it has had an enormous influence on all aspects ofthe traditional Japanese way of life. These include not only thearts of painting, calligraphy, garden design, etc., and thevarious crafts, but also ceremonial activities like serving tea orarranging flowers, and the martial arts of archery, swordsman-ship and judo. Each of these activities is known in Japan as ado, that is, a tao or ‘way’ towards enlightenment.

A Hindu and a Taoist may stressdifferent aspects of the experience; a Japanese Buddhist mayinterpret his or her experience in terms which are very differentfrom those used by an Indian Buddhist; but the basic elementsof the world view which has been developed in all thesetraditions are the same. These elements also seem to be thefundamental features of the world view emerging from modernphysics.The most important characteristic of the Eastern worldview-one could almost say the essence of it-is the awarenessof the unity and mutual interrelation of all things and events,the experience of all phenomena in the world as manifestationsof a basic oneness. All things are seen as interdependent andinseparable parts of this cosmic whole; as different manifesta-tions of the same ultimate reality. The Eastern traditions"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"constantly refer to this ultimate, indivisible reality whichmanifests itself in all things, and of which all things are parts.It is called Brahman in Hinduism, Dharmakaya in Buddhism,Tao in Taoism. Because it transcends all concepts and categories,Buddhists also call it Tathata, or Suchness:What is meant by the soul as suchness, is the oneness ofthe totality of all things, the great all-including whole.’In ordinary life, we are not aware of this unity of all things,but divide the world into separate objects and events. Thisdivision is, of course, useful and necessary to cope with oureveryday environment, but it is not a fundamental feature ofreality. It is an abstraction devised by our discriminating andcategorizing intellect. To believe that our abstract conceptsof separate ‘things’ and ‘events’ are realities of nature is anillusion. Hindus and Buddhists tell us that this illusion is basedon avidya, or ignorance, produced by a mind under the spellof maya. The principal aim of the Eastern mystical traditions istherefore to readjust the mind by centering and quietening itthrough meditation.The Sanskrit term for meditation-samadhi-means literally ‘mental equilibrium’. It refers to thebalanced and tranquil state of mind in which the basic unityof the universe is experienced:Entering into the samadhi of purity, (one obtains) all-penetrating insight that enables one to become consciousof the absolute oneness of the universe.*The basic oneness of the universe is not only the centralcharacteristic of the mystical experience, but is also one ofthe most important revelations of modern physics. It becomesapparent at the atomic level and manifests itself more andmore as one penetrates deeper into matter, down into therealm of subatomic particles. The unity of all things and eventswill be a recurring theme throughout our comparison ofmodern physics and Eastern philosophy. As we study thevarious models of subatomic physics we shall see that theyexpress again and again, in different ways, the same insight-that the constituents of matter and the basic phenomenainvolving them are all interconnected, interrelated and inter-dependent; that they cannot be understood as isolated entities,but only as integrated parts of the whole."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"132In this chapter, I shall discuss how the notion of the basicTheinterconnectedness of nature arises in quantum theory, theTao oftheory of atomic phenomena, through a careful analysis ofPhysicsthe process of observation.*Before entering this discussion,I haveto come back to thedistinction between the mathematicalframework of a theory and its verbal interpretation. The mathe-matical framework of quantum theory has passed countlesssuccessful tests and is now universally accepted as a consistentand accurate description of all atomic phenomena. The verbalinterpretation, on the other hand-i.e. the metaphysics ofquantum theory-is on far less solid ground. In fact, in morethan forty years physicists have not been able to provide a clearmetaphysical model.The following discussion is based on the so-called Copen-hagen interpretation of quantum theory which was developedby Bohr and Heisenberg in the late 1920s and is still the mostwidely accepted model. In my discussion I shall follow thepresentation given by Henry Stapp of the University of Cali-fornia3 which concentrates on certain aspects of the theoryand on a certain type of experimental situation that is frequentlyencountered in subatomic physics.** Stapp’s presentation showsmost clearly how quantum theory implies an essential inter-connectedness of nature, and it also puts the theory in aframework that can readily be extended to the relativisticmodels of subatomic particles to be discussed later on.The starting point of the Copenhagen interpretation is thedivision of the physical world into an observed system (‘object’)and an observing system. The observed system can be anatom, a subatomic particle, an atomic process, etc. The ob-serving system consists of the experimental apparatus and willinclude one or several human observers. A serious difficultynow arises from the fact that the two systems are treated indifferent ways. The observing system is described in the terms*Although I have suppressed all the mathematics and simplified the analysisconsiderably, the following discussion may nevertheless appear to be ratherdry and technical. It should perhaps be taken as ‘yogic’ exercise which-likemany exercises in the spiritual training of the Eastern traditions-may not bemuch fun, but may lead to a profound and beautiful insight into the essentialnature of things.**Other aspects of quantum theory will be discussed in subsequent chapters,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"of classical physics, but these terms cannot be used con-sistently for the description of the observed ‘object’. We knowthat classical concepts are inadequate at the atomic level, yetwe have to use them to describe our experiments and to statethe results. There is no way we can escape this paradox. Thetechnical language of classical physics is just a refinement ofour everyday language and it is the only language we haveto communicate our experimental results.The observed systems are described in quantum theory interms of probabilities. This means that we can never predictwith certainty where a subatomic particle will be at a certaintime, or how an atomic process will occur. All we can do ispredict the odds. For example, most of the subatomic particlesknown today are unstable, that is, they distintegrate-or‘decay’-into other particles after a certain time. It is notpossible, however, to predict this time exactly. We can onlypredict the probability of decay after a certain time or, inother words, the average lifetime of a great number of particlesof the same kind. The same applies to the ‘mode’ of decay.In general, an unstable particle can decay into various com-binations of other particles, and again we cannot predict whichcombination a particular particle will choose. All we can predictis that out of a large number of particles 60 per cent, say, willdecay in one way, 30 per cent in another way, and 10 per centin a third way. It is clear that such statistical predictions needmany measurements to be verified. Indeed, in the collisionexperiments of high-energy physics tens of thousands ofparticle collisions are recorded and analysed to determine theprobability for a particular process.It is important to realize that the statistical formulation of thelaws of atomic and subatomic physics does not reflect ourignorance of the physical situation, like the use of probabilitiesby insurance companies or gamblers. In quantum theory, wehave come to recognize probability as a fundamental featureof the atomic reality which governs all processes, and even theexistence of matter. Subatomic particles do not exist withcertainty at definite places, but rather show ‘tendencies toexist’, and atomic events do not occur with certainty at definitetimes and in definite ways, but rather show ‘tendencies tooccur’.133TheUnity ofAll Things"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"134TheTao ofPhysicsIt is not possible, for example, to say with certainty wherean electron will be in an atom at a certain time. Its positionvisual models of probability patternsdepends on the attractive force binding it to the atomic nucleusand on the influence of the other electrons in the atom. Theseconditions determine a probability pattern which representsthe electron’s tendencies to be in various regions of the atom.The picture above shows some visual models of such prob-ability patterns. The electron is likely to be found where thepatterns are bright and unlikely to be present where they aredark. The important point is that the entire pattern representsthe electron at a given time. Within the pattern, we cannotspeak about theelectron’s position, but only about its tendenciesto be in certain regions. In the mathematical formalism ofquantum theory,these tendencies, or probabilities, arerepresented by the so-called probability function, a mathe-matical quantity which is related to the probabilities of findingthe electron in various places at various times.The contrast between the two kinds of description-classicalterms for the experimental arrangement and probabilityfunctions for the observed objects-leads to deep meta-physical problems which have not yet been resolved. In practice,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"however, these problems are circumvented by describing theobserving system in operational terms, that is, in terms ofinstructions which permit scientists to set up and carry outtheir experiments. In this way, the measuring devices and thescientists are effectively joined into one complex system whichhas no distinct, well-defined parts, and the experimentalapparatus does not have to be described as an isolated physicalentity.For the further discussion of the process of observation itwill be useful to take a definite example, and the simplestphysical entity that can be used is a subatomic particle, suchas the electron. If we want to observe and measure such aparticle, we must first isolate it, or even create it, in a processwhich can be called the preparation process. Once the particlehas been prepared for observation, its properties can bemeasured, and this constitutes the process of measurement.The situation can be represented symbolically as follows.A particle is prepared in the region A, travels from A to B, andis measured in the region B. In practice, both the preparationand the measurement of the particle may consist of a wholeseries of quite complicated processes. In the collision experi-ments of high-energy physics, for example, the preparation ofthe particles used as projectiles consists in sending them arounda circular track and accelerating them until their energy issufficiently high. This process takes place in the particle ac-celerator. When the desired energy is reached, they are madeto leave the accelerator (A) and travel to the target area (B)where they collide with other particles. These collisions takeplace in a bubble chamber where the particles produce visibletracks which are photographed. The properties of the particlesare then deduced from a mathematical analysis of theirtracks; such an analysis can be quite complex and is oftencarried out with the help of computers. All these processesand activities constitute the act of measurement.The important point in this analysis of observation is thatthe particle constitutes an intermediate system connecting theprocesses at A and B. It exists and has meaning only in thiscontext; not as an isolated entity, but as an interconnectionbetween the processes of preparation and measurement. Theproperties of the particle cannot be defined independently of135TheUnity ofAll Things"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"136TheTao ofPhysicsmeasurementobservation of a particle in atomic physicsthese processes. If the preparation or the measurement ismodified, the properties of the particle will change too.On the other hand, the fact that we speak about ‘the particle’,or any other observed system, shows that we have someindependent physical entity in mind which is first preparedand then measured. The basic problem with observation inatomic physics is, then-in the words of Henry Stapp-that‘the observed system is required to be isolated in order to bedefined, yet interacting in order to be observed.‘4 This problemis resolved in quantum theory in a pragmatic way by requiringthat the observed system be free from the external disturbancescaused by the process of observation during some intervalbetween its preparation and subsequent measurement. Sucha condition can be expected if the preparing and measuringdevices are physically separated by a large distance, so thatthe observed object can travel from the region of preparationto the region of measurement.How large, then, does this distance have to be? In principle,it must be infinite. In the framework of quantum theory, theconcept of a distinct physical entity can be defined preciselyonly if this entity is infinitely far away from the agencies ofobservation. In practice, this is of course not possible; neitheris it necessary. We have to remember, here, the basic attitudeof modern science-that all its concepts and theories areapproximate.* In the present case, this means that the concept*See p. 41"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"of a distinct physical entity need not have a precise definition,but can be defined approximately. This is done in the followingway.The observed object is a manifestation of the interactionbetween the processes of preparation and measurement. Thisinteraction is generally complex and involves various effectsextending over different distances; it has various ‘ranges’, aswe say in physics. Now, if the dominant part of the interactionhas a long range, the manifestation of this long-range effectwill travel over a large distance. It will then be free from externaldisturbances and can be referred to as a distinct physicalentity. In the framework of quantum theory, distinct physicalentities are therefore idealizations which are meaningful onlyto the extent that the main part of the interaction has a longrange. Such a situation can be defined mathematically in aprecise way. Physically, it means that the measuring devicesare placed so far apart that their main interaction occursthrough the exchange of a particle or, in more complicatedcases, of a network of particles. There will always be othereffects present as well, but as long as the separation of themeasuring devices is large enough these effects can be ne-glected. Only when the devices are not placed far enough apartwill the short-range effects become dominant. In such a case,the whole macroscopic system forms a unified whole and thenotion of an observed object breaks down.Quantum theory thus reveals an essential interconnected-ness of the universe. It shows that we cannot decompose theworld into independently existing smallest units. As we penetrateinto matter, we find that it is made of particles, but these arenot the ‘basic building blocks’ in the sense of Democritus andNewton. They are merely idealizations which are useful froma practical point of view, but have no fundamental significance.In the words of Niels Bohr, ‘Isolated material particles areabstractions, their properties being definable and observableonly through their interaction with other systems.‘5The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory is notuniversally accepted. There are several counterproposals andthe philosophical problems involved are far from being settled.The universal interconnectedness of things and events, how-ever, seems to be a fundamental feature of the atomic reality--..--- .137TheUnity ofAll Things"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"138which does not depend on a particular interpretation of theThemathematical theory. The following passage from a recentTao ofPhysicsarticle by David Bohm, one of the main opponents of theCopenhagen interpretation, confirms this fact most eloquently.One is led to a new notion of unbroken wholeness whichdenies the classical idea of analyzability of the world intoseparately and independently existing parts . . . We havereversed the usual classical notion that the independent‘elementary parts’ of the world are the fundamentalreality, and that the various systems are merely particularcontingent forms and arrangements of these parts.Rather, we say that inseparable quantum interconnected-ness of the whole universe is the fundamental reality, andthat relatively independently behaving parts are merelyparticular and contingent forms within this whole.”At the atomic level, then, the solid material objects ofclassical physics dissolve into patterns of probabilities, andthese patterns do not represent probabilities of things, butrather probabilities of interconnections. Quantum theoryforces us to see the universe not as a collection of physicalobjects, but rather as a complicated web of relations betweenthe various parts of a unified whole. This, however, is the wayin which Eastern mystics have experienced the world, andsome of them have expressed their experience in words whichare almost identical with those used by atomic physicists.Here are two examples:The material object becomes . . . something different fromwhat we now see, not a separate object on the backgroundor in the environment of the rest of nature but an in-divisible part and even in a subtle way an expression ofthe unity of all that we see.’Things derive their being and nature by mutual dependenceand are nothing in themselves.8If these statements could be taken as an account of hownature appears in atomic physics, the following two statements"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"from atomic physicists could, in turn, be read as a descriptionof the mystical experience of nature:An elementary particle is not an independently existingunanalyzable entity. It is, in essence, a set of relationshipsthat reach outward to other things?The world thus appears as a complicated tissue of events,in which connections of different kinds alternate or over-lap or combine and thereby determine the texture ofthe whole.1°The picture of an interconnected cosmic web which emergesfrom modern atomic physics has been used extensively inthe East to convey the mystical experience of nature. For theHindus, Brahman is the unifying thread in the cosmic web,the ultimate ground of all being:He on whom the sky, the earth, and the atmosphereAre woven, and the wind, together with all life-breaths,Him alone know as the one SOUI.~~In Buddhism, the image of the cosmic web plays an evengreater role. The core of the Avatamsaka Sutra, one of themain scriptures of Mahayana Buddhism,* is the description ofthe world as a perfect network of mutual relations where allthings and events interact with each other in an infinitelycomplicated way. Mahayana Buddhists have developed manyparables and similes to illustrate this universal interrelatedness,some of which will be discussed later on, in connection withthe relativistic version of the ‘web philosophy’ in modernphysics. The cosmic web, finally, plays a central role in TantricBuddhism, a branch of the Mahayana which originated inIndia around the third century A.D. and constitutes today themain school of Tibetan Buddhism. The scriptures of this schoolare called the Tantras, a word whose Sanskrit root means ‘toweave’ and which refers to the interwovenness and inter-dependence of all things and events.*See p. 99139TheUnity ofAll Things"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"In Eastern mysticism, this universal interwovenness alwaysincludes the human observer and his or her consciousness, andthis is also true in atomic physics. At the atomic level, ‘objects’can only be understood in terms of the interaction between theprocesses of preparation and measurement. The end of thischain of processes lies always in the consciousness of thehuman observer. Measurements are interactions which create‘sensations’ in our consciousness-for example, the visualsensation of a flash of light, or of a dark spot on a photographicplate-and the laws of atomic physics tell us with what prob-ability an atomic object will give rise to a certain sensation if welet it interact with us. ‘Natural science’, says Heisenberg, ‘doesnot simply describe and explain nature; it is part of the interplaybetween nature and ourselves.‘12The crucial feature of atomic physics is that the humanobserver is not only necessary to observe the properties of anobject, but is necessary even to define these properties. Inatomic physics, we cannot talk about the properties of anobject as such. They are only meaningful in the context of theobject’s interaction with the observer. In the words of Heisen-berg, ‘What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposedto our method of questioning.‘13 The observer decides how heis going to set up the measurement and this arrangement willdetermine, to some extent, the properties of the observedobject. If the experimental arrangement is modified, theproperties of the observed object will change in turn.This can be illustrated with the simple case of a subatomicparticle. When observing such a particle, one may choose tomeasure-among other quantities-the particle’s position andits momentum (a quantity defined as the particle’s mass timesits velocity). We shall see in the next chapter that an importantlaw of quantum theory-Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle-says that these two quantities can never be measured simul-taneously with precision-We can either obtain a preciseknowledge about the particle’s position and remain completelyignorant about its momentum (and thus about its velocity), orvice versa; or we can have a rough and imprecise knowledgeabout both quantities. The important point now is that thislimitation has nothing to do with the imperfection of ourmeasuring techniques. It is a principle limitation which is"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"inherent in the atomic reality. If we decide to measure theparticle’s position precisely, the particle simply does not havea well-defined momentum, and if we decide to measure themomentum, it does not have a well-defined position.In atomic physics, then, the scientist cannot play the roleof a detached objective observer, but becomes involved inthe world he observes to the extent that he influences theproperties of the observed objects. John Wheeler sees thisinvolvement of the observer as the most important feature ofquantum theory and he has therefore suggested replacing theword ‘observer’ by the word ‘participator’. In Wheeler’s ownwords,Nothing is more important about the quantum principlethan this, that it destroys the concept of the world as‘sitting out there’,with the observer safely separatedfrom it by a 20 centimeter slab of plateglass. Even to observeso miniscule an object as an electron, he must shatterthe glass. He must reach in. He must install his chosenmeasuring equipment. It is up to him to decide whether heshall measure position or momentum. To install theequipment to measure the one prevents and excludes hisinstalling the equipment to measure the other. Moreover,the measurement changes the state of the electron. Theuniverse will never afterwards be the same. To describewhat has happened, one has to cross out that old word‘observer’ and put in its place the new word ‘participator’.In some strange sense the universe is a participatoryuniverse.14The idea of ‘participation instead of observation’ has beenformulated in modern physics only recently, but it is an ideawhich is well known to any student of mysticism. Mysticalknowledge can never be obtained just by observation, butonly by full participation with one’s whole being. The notionof the participator is thus crucial to the Eastern world view,and the Eastern mystics have pushed this notion to the extreme,to a point where observer and observed, subject and object,are not only inseparable but also become indistinguishable.The mystics are not satisfied with a situation analogous to141TheUnity ofAll Things"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"142TheTao ofPhysicsatomic physics, where the observer and the observed cannotbe separated, but can still be distinguished. They go muchfurther, and in deep meditation they arrive at a point wherethe distinction between observer and observed breaks downcompletely, where subject and object fuse into a unifiedundifferentiated whole. Thus the Upanishads say,Where there is a duality, as it were, there one seesanother; there one smells another; there one tastesanother . . .But where everything has become just one’sown self, then whereby and whom would one see? thenwhereby and whom would one smell? then whereby andwhom would one taste/l5This, then, is the final apprehension of the unity of all things.It is reached- so the mystics tell us-in a state of conscious-ness where one’s individuality dissolves into an undifferentiatedoneness, where the world of the senses is transcended andthe notion of ‘things’ is left behind. In the words of ChuangTzu,My connection with the body and its parts is dissolved.My perceptive organs are discarded. Thus leaving mymaterial form and bidding farewell to my knowledge, Ibecome one with the Great Pervader. This I call sittingand forgetting all things.‘6Modern physics, of course, works in a very different frame-work and cannot go that far in the experience of the unity ofall things. But it has made a great step towards the world viewof the Eastern mystics in atomic theory. Quantum theory hasabolished the notion of fundamentally separated objects, hasintroduced the concept of the participator to replace that ofthe observer, and may even find it necessary to include thehuman consciousness in its description of the world.* It hascome to see the universe as an interconnected web of physicaland mental relations whose parts are only defined throughtheir connections to the whole. To summarize the world view*This point will be discussed further in Chapter 18."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"emerging from atomic physics, the words of a Tantric Buddhist,Lama Anagarika Govinda, seem to be perfectly apropos:The Buddhist does not believe in an independent orseparately existing external world, into whose dynamicforces he could insert himself.

Since in our normal stateof consciousness, this unity of all contrasts-and especiallythe unity of opposites-is extremely hard to accept, it con-stitutes one of the most puzzling features of Eastern philosophy.It is, however, an insight which lies at the very root of theEastern world view.Opposites are abstract concepts belonging to the realm ofthought, and as such they are relative. By the very act offocusing our attention on any one concept we create itsopposite. As Lao Tzu says, When all in the world understandbeauty to be beautiful, then ugliness exists; when all under-stand goodness to be good, then evil exists.” The mystictranscends this realm of intellectual concepts, and in trans-cending it he becomes aware of the relativity and polar re-lationship of all opposites. He realizes that good and bad,pleasure and pain, life and death, are not absolute experiencesbelonging to different categories, but are merely two sides ofthe same reality; extreme parts of a single whole. The awarenessthat all opposites are polar, and thus a unity, is seen as one ofthe highest aims of man in the spiritual traditions of the East.‘Be in truth eternal, beyond earthly opposites!’ is Krishna’sadvice in the Bhagavad Cita, and the same advice is given tothe followers of Buddhism. Thus D. T. Suzuki writes,-~I"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"146TheTao ofPhysicsThe fundamental idea of Buddhism is to pass beyond theworld of opposites, a world built up by intellectual dis-tinctions and emotional defilements, and to realize thespiritual world of non-distinction, which involves achievingan absolute point of view.2The whole of Buddhist teaching-and in fact the whole ofEastern mysticism-revolves about this absolute point ofview which is reached in the world of acintya, or ‘no-thought’,where the unity of all opposites becomes a vivid experience.In the words of a Zen poem,At dusk the cock announces dawn;At midnight, the bright sun.3The notion that all opposites are polar-that light and dark,winning and losing, good and evil, are merely different aspectsof the same phenomenon-is one of the basic principles of theEastern way of life. Since all opposites are interdependent,their conflict can never result in the total victory of one side,but will always be a manifestation of the interplay betweenthe two sides. In the East, a virtuous person is therefore notone who undertakes the impossible task of striving for thegood and eliminating the bad, but rather one who is able tomaintain a dynamic balance between good and bad.This notion of dynamic balance is essential to the way inwhich the unity of opposites is experienced in Eastern mysticism.It is never a static identity, but always a dynamic interplaybetween two extremes. This point has been emphasized mostextensively by the Chinese sages in their symbolism of thearchetypal poles yin and yang. They called the unity lyingbehind yin and yang the Tao and saw it as a process whichbrings about their interplay: That which lets now the dark,now the light appear is Tao.‘4The dynamic unity of polar opposites can be illustrated withthe simple example of a circular motion and its projection.Suppose you have a ball going round a circle. If this movementis projected on to a screen, it becomes an oscillation betweentwo extreme points.

In any projection of that kind, the circularmovement will appear as an oscillation between two oppositepoints, but in the movement itself the opposites are unifiedand transcended. This image of a dynamic unification ofopposites was indeed very much in the minds of the Chinesethinkers, as can be seen from the passage in the Chuang-tzuquoted previously :*That the ‘that’ and the ‘this’ cease to be opposites is thevery essence of Tao. Only the essence, an axis as it were,is the centre of the circle responding to the endlesschanges.One of the principal polarities in life is the one between themale and female sides of human nature. As with the polarityof good and bad, or of life and death, we tend to feel un-comfortable with the male/female polarity in ourselves, andtherefore we bring one or the other side into prominence.Western society has traditionally favoured the male side ratherthan the female. Instead of recognizing that the personalityof each man and of each woman is the result of an interplaybetween female and male elements, it has established a static*See p. 114147Beyondthe Worldof Opposites."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Shiva Mahesvara, Elephanta, India, eighth centuryA.D.Shiva Ardhanari, Elephanta, India, eighth century A.Dorder where all men are supposed to be masculine and allwomen feminine, and it has given men the leading roles andmost of society’s privileges. This attitude has resulted in anover-emphasis of all the yang-or male-aspects of humannature: activity, rational thinking, competition, aggressiveness,and so on. The yin-or female-modes of consciousness,which can be described by words like intuitive, religious,mystical, occult or psychic, have constantly been suppressedin our male-oriented society.In Eastern mysticism, these female modes are developed anda unity between the two aspects of human nature is sought.A fully realized human being is one who, in the words of LaoTzu, ‘knows the masculine and yet keeps to the feminine’.In many Eastern traditions the dynamic balance between themale and female modes of consciousness is the principal aimof meditation, and is often illustrated in works of art. A superbsculpture of Shiva in the Hindu temple of Elephanta showsthree faces of the god: on the right, his male profile displayingvirility and will-power; on the left, his female aspect-gentle,charming, seductive-and in the centre the sublime union of"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the two aspects in the magnificent head of Shiva Mahesvara,the Great Lord, radiating serene tranquillity and transcendentalaloofness. In the same temple, Shiva is also represented inandrogynous form-half male, half female-the flowing move-ment of the gods body and the serene detachment of his/herface symbolizing, again, the dynamic unification of the maleand female.In Tantric Buddhism, the male/female polarity is oftenillustrated with the help of sexual symbols. Intuitive wisdom isseen as the passive, female quality of human nature, love andcompassion as the active, male quality, and the union of both inthe process of enlightenment is represented by ecstatic sexualembraces of male and female deities. The Eastern mysticsaffirm that such a union of one’s male and female modes canonly be experienced on a higher plane of consciousness wherethe realm of thought and language is transcended and allopposites appear as a dynamic unity.I have already asserted that a similar plane has been reachedin modern physics. The exploration of the subatomic worldhas revealed a reality which repeatedly transcends languageand reasoning, and the unification of concepts which hadhitherto seemed opposite and irreconcilable turns out to beone of the most startling features of this new reality. Theseseemingly irreconcilable concepts are generally not the onesthe Eastern mystics are concerned with-although sometimesthey are-but their unification at a non-ordinary level of realityprovides a parallel to Eastern mysticism. Modern physicistsshould therefore be able to gain insights into some of thecentral teachings of the Far East by relating them to experiencesin their own field. A small but growing number of youngphysicists have indeed found thisa most valuableand stimulatingapproach to Eastern mysticism.Examples of the unification of opposite concepts in modernphysics can be found at the subatomic level, where particlesare both destructible and indestructible; where matter isboth continuous and discontinuous, and force and matter arebut different aspects of the same phenomenon. In all theseexamples, which will be discussed extensively in subsequentchapters, it turns out that the framework of opposite concepts,derived from our everyday experience, is too narrow for theworld of subatomic particles. Relativity theory is crucial for7149Beyondthe Worldof Opposites"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"150the description of this world, and in the ‘relativistic’ frameworkThethe classical concepts are transcended by going to a higherTao ofdimension, the four-dimensional space-time. Space and timePhysicsthemselves are two concepts which had seemed entirelydifferent, but have been unified in relativistic physics. Thisfundamental unity is the basis of the unification of the oppositeconcepts mentioned above. Like the unity of opposites experi-enced by the mystics, it takes place on a ‘higher plane’, i.e. ina higher dimension, and like that experienced by the mysticsit is a dynamic unity, because the relativistic space-time realityis an intrinsically dynamic reality where objects are alsoprocesses and all forms are dynamic patterns.To experience the unification of seemingly separate entitiesin a higher dimension we do not need relativity theory. It canalso be experienced by going from one to two dimensions, orfrom two to three. In the example of a circular motion and itsprojection given opposite the opposite poles of the oscillationin one dimension (along a line) are unified in the circular move-ment in two dimensions (in one plane). The drawing overleafrepresents another example, involving a transition from twoto three dimensions. It shows a ‘doughnut’ ring cut horizontallyby a plane. In the two dimensions of that plane, the surfaces ofthe cut appear as two completely separate discs, but in threedimensions they are recognized as being parts of one and thesame object. A similar unification of entities which seemseparate and irreconcilable is achieved in relativity theory bygoing from three to four dimensions. The four-dimensionalworld of relativistic physics is the world where force and matterare unified; where matter can appear as discontinuous particlesor as a continuous field. In these cases, however, we can nolonger visualize the unity very well. Physicists can ‘experience’the four-dimensional space-time world through the abstractmathematical formalism of their theories, but their visualimagination-like everybody else’s-is limited to the three-dimensional world of the senses.

In the state of deep meditation, they can transcend thethree-dimensional world of everyday life, and experience atotally different reality where all opposites are unified into anorganic whole. When the mystics try to express this experiencein words, they are faced with the same problems as the physiciststrying to interpret the multidimensional reality of relativisticphysics. In the words of Lama Covinda,An experience of higher dimensionality is achieved byintegration of experiences of different centres and levelsof consciousness. Hence the indescribability of certainexperiencesof meditation on the planeof three-dimensionalconsciousness and within a system of logic which reducesthe possibilities of expression by imposing further limitsupon the process of thinking.5The four-dimensional world of relativity theory is not theonly example in modern physics where seemingly contradictoryand irreconcilable concepts are seen to be nothing more thandifferent aspects of the same reality. Perhaps the most famouscase of such a unification of contradictory concepts is that ofthe concepts of particles and waves in atomic physics.At the atomic level, matter has a dual aspect: it appears asparticles and as waves. Which aspect it shows depends on the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"152TheTao ofPhysicssituation. In some situations the particle aspect is dominant,in others the particles behave more like waves; and this dualnature is also exhibited by light and all other electromagneticradiation. Light, for example, is emitted and absorbed in theform of ‘quanta’, or photons, but when these particles of lighttravel through space they appear as vibrating electric andmagnetic fields which show all the characteristic behaviourof waves. Electrons are normally considered to be particles,and yet when a beam of these particles is sent through a smallslit it is diffracted just like a beam of light-in other wordselectrons, too, behave like waves.a particlea waveThis dual aspect of matter and radiation is indeed moststartling and gave rise to many of the ‘quantum koans’ whichled to the formulation of quantum theory. The picture of awave which is always spread out in space is fundamentallydifferent from the particle picture which implies a sharp location.It has taken physicists a long time to accept the fact that mattermanifests itself in ways which seem to be mutually exclusive;that particles are also waves, waves also particles.Looking at the two pictures, a lay person might be temptedto think that the contradiction can be resolved by saying thatthe picture on the right-hand side simply represents a particlemoving in a wave pattern. This argument, however, rests on amisunderstanding of the nature of waves. Particles moving inwave patterns do not exist in nature. In a water wave, for example,the water particles do not move along with the wave but movein circles as the wave passes by. Similarly, the air particles in asound wave merely oscillate back and forth, but do not pro-pagate along with the wave. What is transported along thewave is the disturbance causing the wave phenomenon, butnot any material particle.

What we mean is that the wave patternas a whole is a manifestation of the particle.

The samemathematical forms are used to describe a light wave, avibrating guitar string, a sound wave, or a water wave. Inquantum theory, these forms are used again to describe thewaves associated with particles. This time, however, the wavesare much more abstract. They are closely related to thestatistical nature of quantum theory, i.e. to the fact that atomicphenomena can only be described in terms of probabilities.The information about the probabilities for a particle is con-tained in a quantity called the probability function, and themathematical form of this quantity is that of a wave, that is tosay, it is similar to the forms used for the description of othertypes of waves. The waves associated with particles, however,are not ‘real’ three-dimensional waves, like water waves orsound waves, but are ‘probability waves’; abstract mathe-matical quantities which are related to the probabilities offinding the particles in various places and with various properties.The introduction of probability waves, in a sense, resolvesthe paradox of particles being waves by putting it in a totallynew context; but at the same time it leads to another pair ofopposite concepts which is even more fundamental, that ofexistence and non-existence. This pair of opposites, too, istranscended by the atomic reality. We can never say that anatomic particle exists at a certain place, nor can we say thatit does not exist. Being a probability pattern, the particle has153Beyondthe Worldof Opposites"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"1154ITheTao ofPhysicstendencies to exist in various places and thus manifests a strangekind of physical reality between existence and non-existence.We cannot, therefore, describe the state of the particle interms of fixed opposite concepts. The particle is not present ata definite place, nor is it absent. It does not change its position,nor does it remain at rest. What changes is the probabilitypattern, and thus the tendencies of the particle to exist incertain places. In the words of Robert Oppenheimer,If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electronremains the same, we must say ‘no’; if we ask whetherthe electron’s position changes with time, we must say‘no’; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say‘no’; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say ‘no’.’The reality of the atomic physicist, like the reality of theEastern mystic, transcends the narrow framework of oppositeconcepts. Oppenheimer’s words thus seem to echo the wordsof the Upanishads,It moves. It moves not.It is far, and It is near.It is within all this,And It is outside of all this.8Force and matter, particles and waves, motion and rest,existence and non-existence-these are some of the oppositeor contradictory concepts which are transcended in modernphysics. Of all these opposite pairs, the last seems to be themost fundamental, and yet, in atomic physics we have to goeven beyond the concepts of existence and non-existence.This is the feature of quantum theory which is most difficultto accept and which lies at the heart of the continuing dis-cussion about its interpretation. At the same time, the trans-cending of the concepts of existence and non-existence is alsoone of the most puzzling aspects of Eastern mysticism. Likethe atomic physicists, the Eastern mystics deal with a realitywhich lies beyond existence and non-existence, and theyfrequently emphasize this important fact. Thus Ashvaghosha:"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Suchness is neither that which is existence, nor that whichis non-existence, nor that which is at once existence andnon-existence, nor that which is not at once existenceand non-existence.9Faced with a reality which lies beyond opposite concepts,physicists and mystics have to adopt a special way of thinking,where the mind is not fixed in the rigid framework of classicallogic, but keeps moving and changing its viewpoint. In atomicphysics, for example, we are now used to applying both theparticle and the wave concept in our description of matter.We have learned how to play with the two pictures, switchingfrom one to the other and back, in order to cope with theatomic reality. This is precisely the way in which the Easternmystics think when they try to interpret their experience of areality beyond opposites. In the words of Lama Govinda, TheEastern way of thinking rather consists in a circling round theobject of contemplation . . .a many-sided, i.e. multi-dimensionalimpression formed from the superimposition of single im-pressions from different points of view.‘lOTo see how one can switch back and forth between theparticle picture and the wave picture in atomic physics, let usexamine the concepts of waves and particles in more detail.A wave is a vibrational pattern in space and time. We can lookat it at a definite instant of time and will then see a periodicpattern in space, as in the following example. This pattern ischaracterized by an amplitude A, the extension of the vibration,and a wavelength L, the distance between two successive crests.a wave patternAlternatively, we can look at the motion of a definite point ofthe wave and will then see an oscillation characterized by acertain frequency, the number of times the point oscillates--155Beyondthe Worldof Opposites"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"156back and forth every second. Now let us turn to the particleThepicture. According to classical ideas, a particle has a well-Tao ofdefined position at any time, and its state of motion can bePhysicsdescribed in terms of its velocity and its energy of motion.Particles moving with a high velocity also have a high energy.Physicists, in fact, hardly use ‘velocity’ to describe the particle’sstate of motion, but rather use a quantity called ‘momentum’which is defined as the particle’s mass times its velocity.Quantum theory,now, associates the properties of aprobability wave with the properties of the correspondingparticle by relating the amplitude of the wave at a certain placeto the probability of finding the particle at that place. Wherethe amplitude is large we are likely to find the particle if welook for it, where it is small, unlikely. The wave train picturedon p. 155, for example, has the same amplitude throughout itslength, and the particle can therefore be found anywherealong the wave with the same likelihood.*The information about the particle’s state of motion iscontained in the wavelength and frequency of the wave. Thewavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum of theparticle, which means that a wave with a small wavelengthcorresponds to a particle moving with a high momentum (andthus with a high velocity). The frequency of the wave is pro-portional to the particle’s energy; a wave with a high frequencymeans that the particle has a high energy. In the case of light,for example, violet light has a high frequency and a shortwavelength and consists therefore of photons of high energyand high momentum, whereas red light has a low frequencyand a long wavelength corresponding to photons of low energyand momentum.A wave which is spread out like the one in our exampledoes not tell us much about the position of the correspondingparticle. It can be found anywhere along the wave with thesame likelihood. Very often, however, we deal with situationswhere the particle’s position is known to some extent, as forexample in the description of an electron in an atom. In such*In this example, one must not think that the particle is more likely to be foundwhere the wave has crests than in the places where it has troughs.

Outside this region theymust be zero. This can be achieved by a wave pattern like theone in the following diagram which corresponds to a particleconfined to the region X.

This pattern shows that theparticle is located somewhere inside the region X, but it doesnot allow us to localize it any further. For points inside theregion we can only give the probabilities for the presence ofthe particle. (The particle is most likely to be present in thecentre where the probability amplitudes are large, and lesslikely near the ends of the wave packet where the amplitudesare small.) The length of the wave packet represents thereforethe uncertainty in the location of the particle.The important property of such a wave packet now is thatit has no definite wavelength, i.e. the distances between twosuccessive crests are not equal throughout the pattern. There*For simplicity, we deal here only with one dimension of space, i.e. with theposition of the particle somewhere along a line.

This has nothing to doPhysicswith quantum theory, but simply follows from the propertiesof waves. Wave packets do not have a definite wavelength.Quantum theory comes into play when we associate the wave-length with the momentum of the corresponding particle. Ifthe wave packet does not have a well-defined wavelength, theparticle does not have a well-defined momentum. This meansthat there is not only an uncertainty in the particle’s position,corresponding to the length of the wave packet, but also anuncertainty in its momentum, caused by the spread in wave-length. The two uncertainties are interrelated, because thespread in wavelength (i.e. the uncertainty of momentum)depends on the length of the wave packet (i.e. on the un-certainty of position). tf we want to localize the particle moreprecisely, that is, if we want to confine its wave packet to asmaller region, this will result in an increase in the spread inwavelength and thus in an increase in the uncertainty of theparticle’s momentum.The precise mathematical form of this relation between theuncertainties of position and momentum of a particle is knownas Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, or uncertainty principle.It means that, in the subatomic world, we can never knowboth the position and momentum of a particle with greataccuracy. The better we know the position, the hazier will itsmomentum be and vice versa. We can decide to undertake aprecise measurement of either of the two quantities; but thenwe will have to remain completely ignorant about the otherone. It is important to realize, as was pointed out in the previouschapter, that this limitation is not caused by the imperfectionof our measuring techniques, but is a limitation of principle.If we decide to measure the particle’s position precisely, theparticle simply does not have a well-defined momentum, andvice versa.The relation between the uncertainties of a particle’s positionand momentum is not the only form of the uncertainty principle.Similar relations hold between other quantities, for examplebetween the time an atomic event takes and the energy itinvolves.

As the particle passes a particular point of observation,the vibrations of the wave pattern at that point will start withsmall amplitudes which will increase and then decrease againuntil finally the vibration will stop altogether.

We can say thatthe passage occurs within this time span, but we cannotlocalize it any further. The duration of the vibration patternrepresents therefore the uncertainty in the temporal locationof the event.Now, as the spatial pattern of the wave packet does nothave a well-defined wavelength, the corresponding vibrationalpattern in time does not have a well-defined frequency. Thespread in frequency depends on the duration of the vibrationalpattern, and since quantum theory associates the frequency ofthe wave with the energy of the particle, the spread in thepattern’s frequency corresponds to an uncertainty in theparticle’s energy. The uncertainty in the location of an eventin time thus becomes related to an uncertainty in energy in thesame way as the uncertainty of a particle’s location in space isrelated to an uncertainty in momentum. This means that wecan never know both the time at which an event occurs andthe energy involved in it with great accuracy. Events occurringinside a short time span involve a large uncertainty in energy;events involving a precise amount of energy can be localizedonly within a long period of time.The fundamental importance of the uncertainty principle isthat it expresses the limitations of our classical concepts in aprecise mathematical form. As described previously, the sub-atomic world appears as a web of relations between the variousparts of a unified whole. Our classical notions, derived fromour ordinary macroscopic experience, are not fully adequateto describe this world. To begin with, the concept of a distinctphysical entity, like a particle, is an idealization which has nofundamental significance. It can only be defined in terms of itsconnections to the whole, and these connections are of astatistical nature-probabilities rather than certainties. Whenwe describe the properties of such an entity in terms of classicalconcepts-like position, energy, momentum, etc.-we find159Beyondthe Worldof Opposites"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"160TheTao ofPhysicsthat there are pairs of concepts which are interrelated andcannot be defined simultaneously in a precise way. The morewe impose one concept on the physical ‘object’, the more theother concept becomes uncertain, and the precise relationbetween the two is given by the uncertainty principle.For a better understanding of this relation between pairs ofclassical concepts, Niels Bohr has introduced the notion ofcomplementarity. He considered the particle picture and thewave picture as two complementary descriptions of the samereality, each of them being only partly correct and having alimited range of application. Each picture is needed to give afull description of the atomic reality, and both are to be appliedwithin the limitations given by the uncertainty principle.This notion of complementarity has become an essentialpart of the way physicists think about nature and Bohr hasoften suggested that it might be a useful concept also outsidethe field of physics; in fact, the notion of complementarityproved to be extremely useful 2,500 years ago. It played anessential role in ancient Chinese thought which was based onthe insight that opposite concepts stand in a polar-or com-plementary-relationship to each other. The Chinese sagesrepresented this complementarity of opposites by the archetypalpoles yin and yang and saw their dynamic interplay as theessence of all natural phenomena and all human situations.Niels Bohr was well aware of the parallel between his conceptof complementarity and Chinese thought. When he visitedChina in 1937, at a time when his interpretation of quantumtheory had already been fully elaborated, he was deeplyimpressed by the ancient Chinese notion of polar opposites,and from that time he maintained an interest in Easternculture. Ten years later, Bohr was knighted as an acknowledg-ment of his outstanding achievements in science and importantcontributions to Danish cultural life; and when he had to choosea suitable motif for his coat-of-arms his choice fell on theChinese symbol of t’ai-chi representing the complementaryrelationship of the archetypal opposites yin and yang.

Whenever we expand therealm of our experience, the limitations of our rational mindbecome apparent and we have to modify, or even abandon,some of our concepts.Our notions of space and time figure prominently on ourmap of reality. They serve to order things and events in ourenvironment and are therefore of paramount importance notonly in our everyday life, but also in owr attempts to understandnature through science and philosophy. There is no law ofphysics which does not require the concepts of space and timefor its formulation. The profound. modification of these basicconcepts brought about by relativity theory was therefore oneof the greatest revolutions in the history of science.Classical physics was based on the notion both of anabsolute, three-dimensional space, independent of the materialobjects it contains, and obeying the laws of Euclidean geometry,and of time as a separate dimension which again is absolute- I--__-. ._-- -----"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"162TheTao ofPhysicsand flows at an even rate, independent of the material world.In the West, these notions of space and time were so deeplyrooted in the minds of philosophers and scientists that theywere taken as true and unquestioned properties of nature.The belief that geometry is inherent in nature, rather thanpart of the framework we use to describe nature, has its originin Greek thought. Demonstrative geometry was the centralfeature of Greek mathematics and had a profound influence onCreek philosophy. Its method of starting from unquestionedaxioms, and deriving theorems from these by deductivereasoning,became characteristic of Creek philosophicalthought; geometry was therefore at the very centre of allintellectual activities and formed the basis of philosophicaltraining. The gate of Plato’s Academy in Athens is said to haveborne the inscription,‘You are not allowed to enter here,unless you know geometry.’ The Greeks believed that theirmathematical theorems were expressions of eternal and exacttruths about the real world, and that geometrical shapes weremanifestations of absolute beauty. Geometry was consideredto be the perfect combination of logic and beauty and wasthus believed to be of divine origin. Hence Plato’s dictum, ‘Godis a geometer.’Since geometry was seen as the revelation of God, it wasobvious to the Creeks that the heavens should exhibit perfectgeometrical shapes. This meant that the heavenly bodies hadto move in circles. To present the picture as being even moregeometrical they were thought to be fixed to a series of con-centric crystalline spheres urhich moved as a whole, with theEarth at the centre.In subsequent centuries, Greek geometry continued to exerta strong influence on Western philosophy and science. Euclid’sElements was a standard textbook in European schools untilthe beginning of this century, and Euclidean geometry wastaken to be the true nature of space for more than two thousandyears. It took an Einstein to make scientists and philosophersrealize that geometry is not inherent in nature, but is imposedupon it by the mind.

Only when this"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"discovery is accepted can the mind feel free to tamperwith the time-honoured notions of space and time, tosurvey the range of possibilities available for definingthem, and to select that formulation which agrees withobservation.’Eastern philosophy, unlike that of the Greeks, has alwaysmaintained that space and time are constructs of the mind.The Eastern mystics treated them like all other intellectualconcepts; as relative, limited, and illusory. In a Buddhist text,for example, we find the words,It was taught by the Buddha, oh Monks, that . . . the past,the future, physical space, . . . and individuals are nothingbut names, forms of thought, words of common usage,merely superficial realities2Thus in the Far East, geometry never attained the status it hadin ancient Greece, although this does not mean that theIndians and Chinese had little knowledge of it. They used itextensively in building altars of precise geometrical shapes, inmeasuring the land and mapping out the heavens, but neverto determine abstract and eternal truths. This philosophicalattitude is also reflected in the fact that ancient Eastern sciencegenerally did not find it necessary to fit nature into a scheme ofstraight lines and perfect circles. Joseph Needham’s remarksabout Chinese astronomy are very interesting in this con-nection :The Chinese [astronomers] did not feel the need for[geometricallforms of explanation-the component organ-isms in the universal organism followed their Tao eachaccording to its own nature, and their motions could bedealt with in the essentially ‘non-representational’ form ofalgebra.

Inthewords of Ashvaghosha,Be it clearly understood that space is nothing but a modeof particularisation and that it has no real existence of itsown . . .Space exists only in relation to our particularisingconsciousness.4The same applies to our idea of time. The Eastern mystics linkthe notions of both space and time to particular states ofconsciousness. Being able to go beyond the ordinary statethrough meditation, they have realized that the conventionalnotions of space and time are not the ultimate truth. Therefined notions of space and time resulting from their mysticalexperiences appear to be in many ways similar to the notionsof modern physics, as exemplified by the theory of relativity.What, then, is this new view of space and time which emergedfrom relativity theory? It is based on the discovery that all spaceand time measurements are relative. The relativity of spatialspecifications was, of course, nothing new. It was well knownbefore Einstein that the position of an object in space canonly be defined relative to some other object. This is usuallydone with the help of three coordinates and the point fromwhich the coordinates are measured may be called the locationof the ‘observer’.To illustrate the relativity of such coordinates, imagine twoobservers floating in space and observing an umbrella, as drawnopposite. Observer A sees the umbrella to his left and slightlyinclined, so that the upper end is nearer to him. Observer B, onthe other hand, sees the umbrella to his right and in such away that the upper end is farther away. By extending this two-dimensional example to three dimensions, it becomes clearthat all spatial specifications-such as ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘up’, ‘down’,‘oblique’, etc.-depend on the position of the observer andare thus relative. This was known long before relativity theory.As far as time is concerned, however, the situation in classicalphysics was entirely different. The temporal order of two events3"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"two observers, A and 6, observing an umbrellawas assumed to be independent of any observer. Specificationsreferring to time-suchas ‘before’, ‘after’ or ‘simultaneous’-were thought to have an absolute meaning independent ofany coordinate system.Einstein recognized that temporal specifications, too, arerelative and depend on the observer. In everyday life, theimpression that we can arrange the events around us in aunique time sequence is created by the fact that the velocityof light-186,000 miles per second-is so high, compared toany other velocity we experience, that we can assume we areobserving events at the instant they are occurring. This, how-ever, is incorrect. Light needs some time to travel from theevent to the observer. Normally, this time is so short that thepropagation of light can be considered to be instantaneous;but when the observer moves with a high velocity with respectto the observed phenomena, the time span between theoccurrence of an event and its observation plays a crucial rolein establishing a sequence of events. Einstein realized that in165Space-Time"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"166such a case, observers moving at different velocities will orderTheevents differently in time.*Two events which are seen asTao ofoccurring simultaneously by one observer may occur inPhysicsdifferent temporal sequences for others. For ordinary velocities,the differences are so small that they cannot be detected, butwhen the velocities approach the speed of light, they give riseto measurable effects. In high energy physics, where theevents are interactions between particles moving almost atthe speed of light, the relativity of time is well established andhas been confirmed by countless experiments.**The relativity of time also forces us to abandon the Newtonianconcept of an absolute space. Such a space was seen as con-taining a definite configuration of matter at every instant; butnow that simultaneity is seen to be a relative concept, dependingon the state of motion of the observer, it is no longer possibleto define such a definite instant for the whole universe. A distantevent which takes place at some particular instant for oneobserver may happen earlier or later for another observer.It is therefore not possible to speak about ‘the universe at agiven instant’ in an absolute way; there is no absolute spaceindependent of the observer.Relativity theory has thus shown that all measurementsinvolving space and time lose their absolute significance andhas forced us to abandon the classical concepts of an absolutespace and an absolute time. The fundamental importance ofthis development has been clearly expressed by Mendel Sachsin the following words:The real revolution that came with Einstein’s theory . . .was the abandonment of the idea that the space-timecoordinate system has objective significance as a separatephysical entity. Instead of this idea, relativity theoryimplies that the space and time coordinates are only theelements of a language that is used by an observer todescribe his environment.5*To derive this result it is essential to take into account the fact that the speedof light is the same for all observers.**Note that in this case, the observer is at rest in his laboratory, but the eventshe observes are caused by particles moving ate different velocities. The effect isthe same. What counts is the relative motion of observer and observed events.Which of the two moves with respect to the laboratory is irrelevant."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"This statement from a contemporary physicist shows the closeaffinity between the notions of space and time in modernphysics and those held by the Eastern mystics who say, asquoted before, that space and time ‘are nothing but names,forms of thought, words of common usage’.Since space and time are now reduced to the subjective roleof the elements of the language a particular observer uses forhis or her description of natural phenomena, each observerwill describe the phenomena in a different way. To abstractsome universal natural laws from their descriptions, they haveto formulate these laws in such a way that they have the sameform in all coordinate systems, i.e. for all observers in arbitrarypositions and relative motion. This requirement is known asthe principle of relativity and was, in fact, the starting pointof relativity theory. It is interesting that the germ of the theoryof relativity was contained in a paradox which occurred toEinstein when he was only sixteen. He tried to imagine how abeam of light would look to an observer who travelled alongwith it at the speed of light, and he concluded that such anobserver would see the beam of light as an electromagneticfield oscillating back and forth without moving on, i.e. withoutforming a wave. Such a phenomenon, however, is unknown inphysics. It seemed thus to the young Einstein that somethingwhich was observed by one observer to be a well-knownelectromagnetic phenomenon, namely a light wave, wouldappear as a phenomenon contradicting the laws of physics toanother observer, and this he could not accept. In later years,Einstein realized that the principle of relativity can be satisfiedin the description of electromagnetic phenomena only if allspatial and temporal specifications are relative. The laws ofmechanics, which govern the phenomena associated withmoving bodies, and the laws of electrodynamics, the theory ofelectricity and magnetism, can then be formulated in a common‘relativistic’ framework which incorporates time with the threespace coordinates as a fourth coordinate to be specified relativeto the observer.In order to check whether the principle of relativity is satisfied,that is, whether the equations of one’s theory look the same inall coordinate systems, one must of course be able to translate"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"168TheTao ofPhysicsthe space and time specifications from one coordinate system,or ‘frame of reference’, to the other. Such translations, or ‘trans-formations’ as they are called, were already well known andwidely used in classical physics. The transformation betweenthe two reference frames pictured on p. 165, for example, ex-presses each of the two coordinates of observer A (one hori-zontal and one vertical, as indicated by the arrow-headedcross in the drawing) as a combination of the coordinates ofobserver B, and vice versa. The exact expressions can be easilyobtained with the help of elementary geometry.In relativistic physics, a new situation arises because timeis added to the three space coordinates as a fourth dimension.Since the transformations between different frames of referenceexpress each coordinate of one frame as a combination of thecoordinates of the other frame, a space coordinate in oneframe will in general appear as a mixture of space and timecoordinates in another frame. This is indeed an entirely newsituation. Every change of coordinate systems mixes space andtime in a mathematically well-defined way. The two can there-fore no longer be separated, because what is space to oneobserver will be a mixture of space and time to another.Relativity theory has shown that space is not three-dimensionaland time is not a separate entity. Both are intimately andinseparably connected and form a four-dimensional continuumwhich is called ‘space-time’. This concept of space-time wasintroduced by Hermann Minkowski in a famous lecture in 1908with the following words:The views of space and time which I wish to lay beforeyou have sprung from the soil of experimental physics,and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Hence-forth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed tofade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of unionof the two will preserve an independent reality.6The concepts of space and time are so basic for the descrip-tion of natural phenomena that their modification entails analteration of the whole framework we use in physics to describenature. In the new framework, space and time are treated on anequal footing and are connected inseparably. In relativistic"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"physics, we can never talk about space without talking abouttime, and vice versa. This new framework has to be usedwhenever phenomena involving high velocities are described.The intimate link between space and time was well knownin astronomy, in a different context, long before relativitytheory. Astronomers and astrophysicists deal with extremelylarge distances, and here again the fact that light needs sometime to travel from the observed object to the observer is im-portant. Because of the finite velocity of light, the astronomernever looks at the universe in its present state, but always looksback into the past. It takes light eight minutes to travel fromthe Sun to the Earth, and hence we see the Sun, at any moment,as it existed eight minutes ago. Similarly, we see the neareststar as it existed four years ago, and with our powerful telescopeswe can see galaxies as they existed millions of years ago.The finite velocity of light is by no means a handicap forastronomers but is a great advantage. It allows them to observethe evolution of stars, star clusters or galaxies at all stages justby looking out into space and back into time. All types ofphenomena that happened during the past millions of yearscan actually be observed somewhere in the skies. Astronomersare thus used to the importance of the link between space andtime. What relativity theory tells us is that this link is importantnot only when we deal with large distances, but also when wedeal with high velocities. Even here on Earth, the measurementof any distance is not independent of time, because it involvesthe specification of the observer’s state of motion and thus areference to time.The unification of space and time entails-as mentioned inthe previous chapter-a unification of other basic concepts,and this unifying aspect is the most characteristic feature ofthe relativistic framework. Concepts which seemed totallyunrelated in nonrelativistic physics are now seen to be butdifferent aspects of one and the same concept. This featuregives the relativistic framework great mathematical eleganceand beauty. Many years of work with relativity theory havemade us appreciate this elegance and become thoroughlyfamiliar with the mathematical formalism. However, this hasnot helped our intuition very much. We have no direct sensoryexperience of the four-dimensional space-time, nor of the other169Space-Time"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"170relativistic concepts. Whenever we study natural phenomenaTheinvolving high velocities, we find it very hard to deal with theseTao ofconcepts both at the level of intuition and ordinary language.PhysicsFor example, in classical physics it was always assumed thatrods in motion and at rest have the same length. Relativitytheory has shown that this is not true. The length of an objectdepends on its motion relative to the observer and it changeswith the velocity of that motion. The change is such that theobject contracts in the direction of its motion. A rod has itsmaximum length in a frame of reference where it is at rest, andit becomes shorter with increasing velocity relative to theobserver. In the ‘scattering’ experiments of high-energy physics,where particles collide with extremely high velocities, therelativistic contraction is so extreme that spherical particlesare reduced to ‘pancake’ shapes.It is important to realize that it makes no sense to ask whichis the ‘real’ length of an object, just as it makes no sense inour everyday life to ask for the real length of somebody’sshadow.Theshadow isa projection of points in three-dimensionalspace on to a two-dimensional plane, and its length will bedifferent for different angles of projection. Similarly, the lengthof a moving object is the projection of points in four-dimensionalspace-time on to three-dimensional space, and its length isdifferent in different frames of reference.What is true for lengths is also true for time intervals. They,too, depend on the frame of reference, but contrary to spatialdistances they become longer as the velocity relative to theobserver increases. This means that clocks in motion runslower; time slows down. These clocks can be of varyingtypes: mechanical clocks, atomic clocks, or even a humanheartbeat. If one of two twins went on a fast round-trip intoouter space, he would be younger than his brother when hecame back home, because all his ‘clocks’-his heartbeat,bloodflow, brainwaves, etc.-would slow down during thejourney, from the point of view of the man on the ground.The traveller himself, of course, would not notice anythingunusual, but on his return he would suddenly realize that histwin brother was now much older. This ‘twin paradox’ isperhaps the most famous paradox of modern physics. It hasprovoked heated discussions in scientific journals, some of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"which are still going on; an eloquent proof of the fact that thereality described by relativity theory cannot easily be graspedby our ordinary understanding.The slowing down of clocks in motion, unbelievable as itsounds, is well tested in particle physics. Most of the subatomicparticles are unstable, i.e. they disintegrate after a certain timeinto other particles. Numerous experiments have confirmedthe fact that the lifetime* of such an unstable particle dependson its state of motion. It increases with the speed of the particle.Particles moving with 80 per cent of the speed of light live aboutI.7 times as long as their slow ‘twin brothers’, and at 99 percent of the speed of light they live about 7 times as long. This,again, does not mean that the intrinsic lifetime of the particlechanges. From the particle’s point of view, its lifetime is alwaysthe same, but from the point of view of the laboratory observerthe particle’s ‘internal clock’ has slowed down, and thereforeit lives longer.All these relativistic effects only seem strange because wecannot experience the four-dimensional space-time worldwith our senses, but can only observe its three-dimensional‘images’. These images have different aspects in differentframes of reference; moving objects look different from objectsat rest, and moving clocks run at a different rate. These effectswill seem paradoxical if we do not realize that they are onlythe projections of four-dimensional phenomena, just as shadowsare projections of three-dimensional objects. If we couldvisualize the four-dimensional space-time reality, there wouldbe nothing paradoxical at all.The Eastern mystics, as mentioned above, seem to be able toattain non-ordinary states of consciousness in which theytranscend the three-dimensional world of everyday life toexperience a higher, multidimensional reality. Thus Aurobindospeaks about ‘a subtle change which makes the sight see in.asort of fourth dimension’.’ The dimensions of these states ofconsciousness may not be the same as the ones we are dealingwith in relativistic physics, but it is striking that they have led*A small technical point should perhaps be mentioned.

The fact thatspace and time are inseparably linked, which is so characteristicof relativistic physics, is stressed again and again. This intuitivenotion of space and time has, perhaps, found its clearestexpression and its most far-reaching elaboration in Buddhism,and in particular in the Avatamsaka school of MahayanaBuddhism. The Avatamsaka Sutra, on which this school is based,*gives a vivid description of how the world is experienced inthe state of enlightenment. The awareness of an ‘interpenetra-tion of space and time’-a perfect expression to describe space-time-is repeatedly emphasized in the sutra and is seen as anessential characteristic of the enlightened state of mind. In thewords of D. T. Suzuki,The significance of the Avatamsaka and its philosophy isunintelligible unless we once experience . . . a state of com-plete dissolution where there is no more distinctionbetween mind and body, subject and object . . . We lookaround and perceive that . . . every object is related toevery other object . . .not only spatially, but temporally.. . .As a fact of pure experience, there is no space withouttime, no time without space; they are interpenetrating.8One could hardly find a better way of describing the relativisticconcept of space-time. In comparing Suzuki’s statement tothe one, quoted before, by Minkowski, it is also interesting tonote that both the physicist and the Buddhist emphasize thefact that their notions of space-time are based on experience;on scientific experiments in one case, and on mystical experiencein the other.In my opinion, the time-minded intuition of Eastern mysticismis one of the main reasons why its views of nature seem tocorrespond, in general, much better to modern scientificviews than do those of most Creek philosophers. Greek naturalphilosophy was, on the whole, essentially static and largely*See p. 98"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"based on geometrical considerations. It was, one could say,extremely ‘non-relativistic’, and its strong influence on Westernthought may well be one of the reasons why we have suchgreat conceptual difficulties with relativistic models in modernphysics. The Eastern philosophies, on the other hand, are‘space-time’ philosophies, and thus their intuition often comesvery close to the views of nature implied by our modernrelativistic theories.Because of the awareness that space and time are intimatelyconnected and interpenetrating, the world views of modernphysics and of Eastern mysticism are both intrinsically dynamicviews which contain time and change as essential elements.This point will be discussed in detail in the following chapter,and constitutes the second main theme recurring throughoutthis comparison of physics and Eastern mysticism, the firstbeing the unity of all things and events. As we study therelativistic models and theories of modern physics, we shallsee that all of them are impressive illustrations of the twobasic elements of the Eastern world view-the basic onenessof the universe and its intrinsically dynamic character.The theory of relativity discussed so far is known as the ‘specialtheory of relativity’. It provides a common framework for thedescription of the phenomena associated with moving bodiesand with electricity and magnetism, the basic features of thisframework being the relativity of space and time and theirunification into four-dimensional space-time.In the ‘general theory of relativity’, the framework of thespecial theory is extended to include gravity. The effect ofgravity, according to general relativity, is to make space-timecurved. This, again, is extremely hard to imagine. We caneasily imagine a two-dimensional curved surface, such as thesurface of an egg, because we can see such curved surfaceslying in three-dimensional space. The meaning of the wordcurvature for two-dimensional curved surfaces is thus quiteclear; but when it comes to three-dimensional space-letalone four-dimensional space-time-our imagination abandonsus. Since we cannot look at three-dimensional space ‘fromoutside’, we cannot imagine how it can be ‘bent in somedirection’.173Space-Time"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"174TheTao ofPhysicsTo understand the meaning of curved space-time, we haveto use curved two-dimensional surfaces as analogies.

The crucial fact whichmakes the analogy to space-time possible is that the curvatureis an intrinsic property of that surface and can be measuredwithout going into three-dimensional space. A two-dimensionalinsect confined to the surface of the sphere and unable toexperience three-dimensional space could nevertheless findout that the surface on which he is living is curved, providedthat he can make geometrical measurements.To see how this works, we have to compare the geometryof our bug on the sphere with that of a similar insect living on aflat surface.* Suppose the two bugs begin their study of geometryby drawing a straight line, defined as the shortest connectionbetween two points. The result is shown below. We see thatthe bug on the flat surface drew a very nice straight line; butwhat did the bug on the sphere do? For him, the line he drewdrawing a’straight line’ on a plane and on a sphereis the shortest connection between the two points A and B,since any other line he may draw will be longer; but from ourpoint of view we recognize it as a curve (the arc of a greatcircle, to be precise).

The example ofthe two bugs shows that we can always determine whether asurface is curved or not, just by making geometrical measure-ments on the surface, and by comparing the results with thosepredicted by Euclidean geometry. If there is a discrepancy,the surface is curved; and the larger the discrepancy is-for agiven size of figures-the stronger the curvature.In the same way, we can define a curved three-dimensionalspace to be one in which Euclidean geometry is no longervalid. The laws of geometry in such a space will be of a different,\\‘non-Euclidean’ type. Such a non-Euclidean geometry wash aintroduced as a purely abstract mathematical idea in thenineteenth century by. the mathematician Georg Riemann,and it was not considered to be more than that, until Einsteinmade the revolutionary suggestion that the three-dimensionalspace in which we live is actually curved. According to Einstein’stheory, the curvature of space is caused by the gravitationalfields of massive bodies. Wherever there is a massive object,the space around it is curved, and the degree of curvature, thatis, the degree to which the geometry deviates from that ofEuclid, depends on the mass of the object.The equations relating the curvature of space to the distri-bution of matter in that space are called Einstein’s fieldequations. They can be applied not only to determine the localvariations of curvature in the neighbourhood of stars andplanets, but also to find out whether there is an overall curvatureof space on a large scale. In other words, Einstein’s equationscan be used to determine the structure of the universe as awhole. Unfortunately, they do not give a unique answer.Several mathematical solutions of the equations are possible,and these solutions constitute the various models of theuniverse studied in cosmology, some of which will be discussedin the following chapter. To determine which of them corre-sponds to the actual structure of our universe is the main taskof present-day cosmology.Since space can never be separated from time in relativitytheory, the curvature caused by gravity cannot be limited tothree-dimensional space, but must extend to four-dimensional"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"space-time and this is, indeed, what the general theory ofrelativity predicts. In a curved space-time, the distortionscaused by the curvature affect not only the spatial relationshipsdescribed by geometry but also the lengths of time intervals.Times does not flow at the same rate as in ‘flat space-time’,and as the curvature varies from place to place, accordingto the distribution of massive bodies, so does the flow of time.It is important to realize, however, that this variation of theflow of time can only be seen by an observer who remains ina different place from the clocks used to measure the variation.If the observer, for example, went to a place where time flowsslower, all her clocks would slow down too and she would haveno means of measuring the effect.In our terrestrial environment, the effects of gravity on spaceand time are so small that they are insignificant, but in astro-physics, which deals with extremely massive bodies, like planets,stars and galaxies, the curvature of space-time is an importantphenomenon. All observations have so far confirmed Einstein’stheory and thus force us to believe that space-time is indeedcurved. The most extreme effects of the curvature of space-timebecome apparent during the gravitational collapse of a massivestar. According to current ideas in astrophysics, every starreaches a stage in its evolution where it collapses due to themutual gravitational attraction of its particles. Since thisattraction increases rapidly as the distance between theparticles decreases, the collapse accelerates and if the star ismassive enough, that is, if it is more than twice as massive asthe Sun, no known process can prevent the collapse from goingon indefinitely.As the star collapses and becomes more and more dense,the force of gravity on its surface becomes stronger andstronger, and consequently the space-time around it becomesmore and more curved. Because of the increasing force ofgravity on the star’s surface, it becomes more and moredifficult to get away from it, and eventually the star reaches astage where nothing-not even light-can escape from itssurface. At that stage, we say that an ‘event horizon’ formsaround the star, because no signal can get away from it tocommunicate any event to the outside world. The space aroundthe star is then so strongly curved that all the light is trappedin it and cannot escape. We are not able to see such a star,177Space-Time"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"178because its light can never reach us and for this reason it isThecalled a black hole. The existence of black holes was predictedTao ofon the grounds of relativity theory as early as 1916 and they 7Physicshave lately received a great deal of attention because somerecently discovered stellar phenomena might indicate theexistence of a heavy star moving around some unseen partnerwhich could be a black hole.Black holes are among the most mysterious and mostfascinating objects investigated by modern astrophysics andillustrate the effects of relativity theory in a most spectacularway. The strong curvature of space-time around them preventsnot only all their light from reaching us, but has an equallystriking effect on time. If a clock, flashing its signals to us, wereattached to the surface of the collapsing star, we’would observethese signals to slow down as the star approached the eventhorizon, and once the star had become a black hole, no clocksignals would reach us any more. To an outside observer, theflow of time on the star’s surface slows down as the star col-lapses and it stops altogether at the event horizon. Therefore,the complete collapse of the star takes an infinite time. The staritself, however, experiences nothing peculiar when it collapsesbeyond the event horizon. Time continues to flow normallyand the collapse is completed after a finite period of time, whenthe star has contracted to a point of infinite density. So howlong -does the collapse really take, a finite time or an infinitetime? In the world of relativity theory, such a question doesnot make sense. The lifetime of a collapsing star, like all othertime spans, is relative and depends on the frame of referenceof the observer.In the general theory of relativity, the classical concepts ofspace and time as absolute and independent entities arecompletely abolished. Not only are all measurements involvingspace and time relative, depending on the state of motion ofthe observer, but the whole structure of space-time is in-extricably linked to the distribution of matter. Space is curvedto different degrees and time flows at different rates in differentparts of the universe.

Instead of a linear succession ofinstants, they experience-so they say-an infinite, timeless,and yet dynamic present. In the following passages, threeEastern mystics speak about the experience of this ‘eternalnow’; Chuang Tzu, the Taoist sage; Hui-neng, the Sixth ZenPatriarch; and D. T.

In these diagrams, the horizontal directionrepresents space,* and the vertical direction, time. The pathof the particle through space-time is called its ‘world line’. Ifthe particle is at rest, it nevertheless moves through time, andits world line is, in that case, a straight vertical line. If theparticle moves in space, its world line will be inclined; thegreater the inclination of the world line, the faster the particlemoves. Note that the particles can only move upwards intime, but can move backwards or forwards in space. Theirworld lines can be inclined towards the horizontal to variousdegrees, but can never become completely horizontal, sincethis would mean that a particle travels from one place to theother in no time at all.Space-time diagrams are used in relativistic physics topicture the interactions between various particles.

It is one of the main relativistic theories of modernphysics whose basic concepts will be discussed later on. Forour discussion of space-time diagrams, it will be sufficient toknow two characteristic features of the theory. The first is thefact that all interactions involve the creation and destructionof particles, like the absorption and emission of the photon inour diagram; and the second feature is a basic symmetrybetween particles and antiparticles. For every particle, thereexists an antiparticle with equal mass and opposite charge.The antiparticle of the electron, for example, is called thetimespacebelectron-photon scatteringpositron and is usually denoted by e+. The photon, having nocharge, is its own antiparticle. Pairs of electrons and positronscan be created spontaneously by photons, and can be madeto turn into photons in the reverse process of annihilation.The space-time diagrams, now, are greatly simplified if thefollowing trick is adopted. The arrowhead on a world line is nolonger used to indicate the direction of motion of the particle(which is unnecessary, anyway, since all particles move forwardsin time, i.e. upwards in the diagram).

To make the diagram even simpler, wecan also leave out the space axis and the time axis, rememberingthat the direction of time is from the bottom to the top, andthat the forward direction in space is from left to right.

We have read them from the bottomto the top, according to our conventional notion of a linearflow of time. The unusual aspect is connected with diagramscontaining positron lines, like the one picturing the positron-photon scattering. The mathematical formalism of field theorysuggests that these lines can be interpreted in two ways;either as positrons moving forwards in time, or as electronsmoving backwards in time! The interpretations are mathe-matically identical; the same expression describes an anti-particle moving from the past to the future, or a particle movingfrom the future to the past. Our two diagrams can thus beseen as picturing the same process evolving in differentdirections in time. Both of them can be interpreted as thescattering of electrons and photons, but in one process theparticles move forwards in time, in the other they movebackwards.* The relativistic theory of particle interactions showsthus a complete symmetry with regard to the direction of time.All space-time diagrams may be read in either direction.

Reading the diagramin the conventional way, from the bottom to the top, we willinterpret it as follows: an electron (represented by a solid line)and a photon (represented by a dashed line) approach eachother; the photon creates an electron-positron pair at pointA, the electron flying off to the right, the positron to the left;the positron then collides with the initial electron at pointB and they annihilate each other, creating a photon in theprocess which flies off to the left. Alternatively, we may alsointerpret the process as the interaction of the two photonswith a single electron travelling first forwards in time, thenbackwards, and then forwards again. For this interpretation,we just follow the arrows on the electron line all the waythrough; the electron travels to point B where it emits a photonand reverses its direction to travel backwards through time topoint A; there it absorbs the initial photon, reverses its directionagain and flies off travelling forwards through time.

On the other hand, wenotice immediately that in doing so we run into serious difficultiesof language. The electron travels ‘first’ to point B, and ‘then’ toA; yet the absorption of the photon at A happens before theemission of the other photon at B.The best way to avoid these difficulties is to see space-timediagrams like the one above not as chronological records ofthe paths of particles through time, but rather as four-dimen-sional patterns in space-time representing a network of inter-related events which does not have any definite direction oftime attached to it. Since all particles can move forwards andbackwards in time, just as they can move left and right in space,it does not make sense to impose a one-way flow of time onthe diagrams. They are simply four-dimensional maps tracedout in space-time in such a way that we cannot speak of anytemporal sequence. In the words of Louis De Broglie:In space-time, everything which for each of us constitutesthe past, the present, and the future is given en bloc . . .Each observer, as his time passes, discovers, so to speak,new slices of space-time which appear to him as successiveaspects of the material world, though in reality the ensembleof events constituting space-time exist prior to his know-ledge of them.12This, then, is the full meaning of space-time in relativisticphysics. Space and time are fully equivalent; they are unifiedinto a four-dimensional continuum in which the particle inter-actions can stretch in any direction. If we want to picturethese interactions, we have to picture them in one ‘four-\\dimensional snap shot’ covering the whole span of time as wellas the whole region of space. To get the right feeling for therelativistic world of particles, we must ‘forget the lapse of time’,as Chuang Tzu says, and this is why the space-time diagramsof field theory can be a useful analogy to the space-timeexperience of the Eastern mystic. The relevance of the analogyis made evident by the following remarks by Lama Govindaconcerning Buddhist meditation :185Space-TimeIf we speak of the space-experience in meditation, we aredealing with an entirely different dimension . . .

Themystics, on the other hand, maintain that they can actuallyexperience the full span of space-time where time does notflow any longer. Thus the Zen master Dogen:It is believed by most that time passes; in actual fact, itstays where it is. This idea of passing may be called time,but it is an incorrect idea, for since one sees it only aspassing, one cannot understand that it stays just where itis.14Many of the Eastern teachers emphasize that thought musttake place in time, but that vision can transcend it. ‘Vision’, saysCovinda, ‘is bound up with a space of a higher dimension, andtherefore timeless.‘15The space-time of relativistic physics is asimilar timeless space of a higher dimension. All events in itare interconnected, but the connections are not causal.Particle interactions can be interpreted in terms of cause andeffect only when the space-time diagrams are read in a definitedirection, e.g. from the bottom to the top. When they aretaken as four-dimensional patterns without any definite directionof time attached to them, there is no ‘before’ and no ‘after’,and thus no causation.Similarly, the Eastern mystics assert that in transcending time,they also transcend the world of cause and effect. Like ourordinary notions of space and time, causation is an idea whichis limited to a certain experience of the world and has to beabandoned when this experience is extended.

It hastherefore been said that Eastern mysticism is a liberation fromtime. in a way, the same may be said of relativistic physics.187Space-Time"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"13 THEDYNAMICUNIVERSEThe central aim of Eastern mysticism is to experience allphenomena in the world as manifestations of the same ultimatereality. This reality is seen as the essence of the universe,underlying and unifying the multitude of things and eventswe observe. The Hindus call it &&man, the Buddhists Dharma-kaya (the Body of Being), or Tathata (Suchness), and the TaoistsTao; each affirming that it transcends our intellectual conceptsand defies further description. This ultimate essence, however,cannot be separated from its multiple manifestations. It iscentral to its very nature to manifest itself in myriad formswhich come into being and disintegrate, transforming them-selves into one another without end. In its phenomenal aspect,the cosmic One is thus intrinsically dynamic, and the appre-hension of its dynamic nature is basic to all schools of Easternmysticism. Thus D. T. Suzuki writes about the Kegon school ofMahayana Buddhism,The central idea of Kegon is to grasp the universe dynamic-ally whose characteristic is always to move onward, to beforever in the mood of moving, which is life.’This emphasis on movement, flow and change is not onlycharacteristic of the Eastern mystical traditions, but has beenan essential aspect of the world view of mystics throughoutthe ages. In ancient Greece, Heraclitus taught that ‘everythingflows’ and compared the world to an ever-living fire, and inMexico, the Yaqui mystic Don Juan talks about the ‘fleetingworld’ and affirms that ‘to be a man of knowledge one needsto be light and fluid.‘*--. --- ‘------- _- -_ -"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"190In Indian philosophy, the main terms used by Hindus andThe’Buddhists have dynamic connotations. The word Brahman isTao ofderived from the Sanskrit root brih-to grow-and thusPhysicssuggests a reality which is dynamic and alive. In the words ofS. Radhakrishnan, The word Brahman means growth and issuggestive of life, motion and progress.‘3 The &an&ha& referto Brahman as ‘this unformed, immortal, moving’,4 thusassociating it with motion even though it transcends allforms.The Rig Vecfa uses another term to express the dynamicnature of the universe, the term Rita. This word comes fromthe root ri-to move; its original meaning in the Rig Vedabeing ‘the course of all things’, ‘the order of nature’. It playsan important role in the legends of the Veda and is connectedwith all the Vedic gods. The order of nature was conceived bythe Vedic seers, not as a static divine law, but as a dynamicprinciple which is inherent in the universe. This idea is notunlike the Chinese conception of Tao-The Way’-as theway in which the universe works, i.e. the order of nature. Likethe Vedic seers, the Chinese sages saw the world in terms offlow and change, and thus gave the idea of a cosmic order anessentially dynamic connotation. Both concepts, Rita and Tao,were later brought down from their original cosmic level tothe human level and were interpreted in a moral sense; Ritaas the universal law which all gods and men must obey, andTao as the right way of life.The Vedic concept of Rita anticipates the idea of karmawhich was developed later to express the dynamic interplayof all things and events. The word karma means ‘action’ anddenotes the ‘active’, or dynamic, interrelation of all phenomena.In the words of the Bhagavad Cita, ‘All actions take place intime by the interweaving of the forces of nature.‘5 The Buddhatook up the traditional concept of karma and gave it a newmeaning by extending the idea of dynamic interconnectionsto the sphere of human situations. Karma thus came to signifythe never-ending chain of cause and effect in human life whichthe Buddha had broken in attaining the state of enlightenment.Hinduism has also found many ways of’ expressing thedynamic nature of the universe in mythical language. ThusKrishna says in the Gita, ‘If I did not engage in action, these7"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"worlds would perish,‘6and Shiva, the Cosmic Dancer, isperhaps the most perfect personification of the dynamicuniverse. Through his dance, Shiva sustains the manifoldphenomena in the world, unifying all things by immersingthem in his rhythm and making them participate in the dance-a magnificent image of the dynamic unity of the universe.The general picture-emerging from Hinduism is one of anorganic, growing and rhythmically moving cosmos; of auniverse in which everything is fluid and ever-changing, allstatic forms being maya, that is, existing only as illusory con-cepts. This last idea-the impermanence of all forms-is thestarting point of Buddhism. The Buddha taught that ‘all com-pounded things are impermanent’, and that all suffering in theworld arises from our trying to cling to fixed forms-objects,people or ideas-instead of accepting the world as it movesand changes. The dynamic world view lies thus at the veryroot of Buddhism. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan:A wonderful philosophy of dynamism was formulated byBuddha 2,500 years ago . . .Impressed with the transitori-ness of objects, the ceaseless mutation and transformationof things, Buddha formulated a philosophy of change. Hereduces substances, souls, monads, things to forces,movements, sequences and processes, and adopts adynamic conception of reality.’Buddhists call this world of ceaseless change samsara,which means, literally, ‘incessantly in motion’; and they affirmthat there is nothing in it which is worth clinging to. So for theBuddhists, an enlightened being is one who does not resistthe flow of life, but keeps moving with it. When the Ch’anmonk’ Yin-men was asked, What is the Tao?’ he answeredsimply, Walk on!’ Accordingly, Buddhists also call the Buddhathe Tathagata, or ‘the one who comes and goes thus’. InChinese philosophy, the flowing and ever-changing reality iscalled the Tao and is seen as a cosmic process in which allthings are involved. Like the Buddhists, the Taoists say that oneshould not resist the flow, but should adapt one’s actions to it.This, again, is characteristic of the sage-the enlightenedbeing. If the Buddha is one who ‘comes and goes thus’, the191TheDynamicUniverse-."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"192Taoist sage is one who ‘flows’, as Huai Nan Tzu says,* ‘in theThecurrent of the Tao’.Tao ofPhysicsThe more one studies the religious and philosophical texts ofthe Hindus, Buddhists and Taoists, the more it becomesapparent that in all of them the world is conceived in terms ofmovement, flow and change. This dynamic quality of Easternphilosophy seems to be one of its most important features.The Eastern mystics see the universe as an inseparable web,whose interconnections are dynamic and not static. The cosmicweb is alive; it moves, grows and changes continually. Modernphysics, too, has come to conceive of the universe as such aweb of relations and, like Eastern mysticism; has recognizedthat this web is intrinsically dynamic. The dynamic aspect ofmatter arises in quantum theory as a consequence of thewave-nature of subatomic particles, and is even more essentialin relativity theory, as we shall see, where the unification ofspace and time implies that the being of matter cannot beseparated from its activity. The properties of subatomic particlescan therefore only be understood in a dynamic context; interms of movement, interaction and transformation.According to quantum theory, particles are also waves, andthis implies that they behave in a very peculiar way. Whenevera subatomic particle is confined to a small region of space, itreacts to this confinement by moving around. The smaller theregion of confinement, the faster will the particle ‘jiggle’ aroundin it. This behaviour is a typical ‘quantum effect’, a feature ofthe subatomic world which has no macroscopic analogy. Tosee how it comes about, we have to remember that particlesare represented, in quantum theory, by wave packets. Asdiscussed previously,**the length of such a wave packetrepresents the uncertainty in the location of the particle. Thefollowing wave pattern, for example, corresponds to a particlelocated somewhere in the region X; where exactly we cannotsay with certainty. If we want to localize the particle moreprecisely, i.e. if we want to confine it to a smaller region, wehave to squeeze its wave packet into this region (see diagram*See p.117.**Seep. 158.-~"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"4bXa wave packetbelow ). This, however, will affect the wavelength of the wavepacket, and consequently the velocity of the particle. As a result,the particle will move around; the more it is confined, the fasterit will move.squeezing the wave packet into a smaller regionThe tendency of particles to react to confinement withmotion implies a fundamental ‘restlessness’ of matter which ischaracteristic of the subatomic world. In this world, most ofthe material particles are bound to the molecular, atomic andnuclear structures, and therefore are not at rest but have aninherent tendency to move about-they are intrinsicallyrestless. According to quantum theory, matter is thus neverquiescent, but always in a state of motion. Macroscopically,the material objects around us may seem passive and inert,but when we magnify such a ‘dead’ piece of stone or metal,T193TheDynamicUniverse"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"194we see that it is full of activity. The closer we look at it, theThemore alive it appears. All the material objects in our environ-Tao ofment are made of atoms which link up with each other inPhysicsvarious ways to form an enormous variety of molecularstructures which are not rigid and motionless, but oscillateaccording to their temperature and in harmony with thethermal vibrations of their environment. In the vibrating atoms,the electrons are bound to the atomic nuclei by electric forceswhich try to keep them as close as possible, and they respondto this confinement by whirling around extremely fast. In thenuclei, finally, the protons and neutrons are pressed into aminute volume by the strong nuclear forces, and consequentlyrace about with unimaginable velocities.Modern physics, then, pictures matter not at all as passiveand inert, but as being in a continuous dancing and vibratingmotion whose rhythmic patterns are determined by themolecular, atomic and nuclear structures. This is also the wayin which the Eastern mystics see the material world. They allemphasize that the universe has to be grasped dynamically,as it moves, vibrates and dances; that nature is not in a static,but a dynamic equilibrium. In the words of a Taoist text,The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness. Onlywhen there is stillness in movement can the spiritualrhythm appear which pervades heaven and earth.8In physics, we recognize the dynamic nature of the universenot only when we go to small dimensions-to the world ofatoms and nuclei-but also when we turn to large dimensions-to the world of stars and galaxies. Through our powerful tele-scopes we observe a universe in ceaseless motion. Rotatingclouds of hydrogen gas contract to form stars, heating up inthe process until they become burning fires in the sky. Whenthey have reached that stage, they still continue to rotate,some of them ejecting material into space which spirals out-wards and condenses into planets circling around the star.Eventually, after millions of years, when most of its hydrogenfuel is used up, a star expands, and then contracts again in thefinal gravitational collapse. This collapse may involve giganticexplosions, and may even turn the star into a black hole. All- -.___--__‘7"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"196TheTao ofPhysicsthese activities-the formation of stars out of interstellar gasclouds, their contraction and subsequent expansion, and theirfinal collapse-can all actually be observed somewhere in theskies.The spinning, contracting, expanding or exploding starscluster into galaxies of various shapes-flat discs, spheres,spirals, etc.-which, again, are not motionless but rotate. Ourgalaxy, the Milky Way, is an immense disc of stars and gasturning in space like a huge wheel, so that all its stars-in-cluding the Sun and its planets-move around the galaxy’scentre. The universe is, in fact, full of galaxies strewn throughall the space we can see; all spinning like our own.When we study the universe as a whole, with its millions ofgalaxies, we have reached the largest scale of space and time;and again, at that cosmic level, we discover that the universeis not static-it is expanding! This has been one of the mostimportant discoveries in modern astronomy. A detailed analysisof the light received from distant galaxies has shown that thewhole swarm of galaxies expands and that it does so in a wellorchestrated way; the recession velocity of any galaxy weobserve is proportional to the galaxy’s distance. The moredistant the galaxy, the faster it moves away from us; at doublethe distance, the recession velocity will also double. This istrue not only for distances measured from our galaxy, butapplies to any point of reference. Whichever galaxy you happento be in, you will observe the other galaxies rushing away fromyou; nearby galaxies at several thousand miles per second,farther ones at higher speeds, and the farthest at velocitiesapproaching the speed of light. The light from galaxies beyondthat distance will never reach us, because they move awayfrom us faster than the speed of light. Their light is-in thewords of Sir Arthur Eddington-‘like a runner on an expandingtrack with the winning post receding faster than he can run’.To have a better idea of the way in which the universeexpands, we have to remember that the proper framework forstudying its large-scale features is Einstein’s general theory ofrelativity. According to this theory, space is not ‘flat’, but is‘curved’, and the precise way in which it is curved is related tothe distribution of matter by Einstein’s field equations. Theseequations can be used to determine the structure of the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"universe as a whole; they are the starting point of moderncosmology.When we talk about an expanding universe in the frameworkof general relativity, we mean an expansion in a higher dimen-sion. Like the concept of curved space, we can only visualizesuch a concept with the help of a two-dimensional analogy.Imagine a balloon with a large number of dots on its surface.The balloon represents the universe, its two-dimensionalcurved surface representing the three-dimensional curved. .. . .. . . .. . . . .Q. . . .. . .. ..space, and the dots on the surface the galaxies in that space.When the balloon is blown up, all the distances between thedots increase. Whichever dot you choose to sit on, all the otherdots will move away from you. The universe expands in thesame way: whichever galaxy an observer happens to be in,the other galaxies will all move away from him.An obvious question to be asked about the expandinguniverse is: how did it all start? From the relation between thedistance of a galaxy and its recession velocity-which isknown as Hubble’s law-one can calculate the starting pointof the expansion, in other words, the age of the universe.Assuming that there has been no change in the rate of expan-sion, which is by no means certain, one arrives at an age ofthe order of 10,000 million years. This, then, is the age of theuniverse. Most cosmologists believe today that the universecame into being in a highly dramatic event about 10,000million years ago, when its total mass exploded out of a small197TheDynamicUniverse"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"198TheTao ofPhysicsprimeval fireball. The present expansion of the universe is seenas the remaining thrust of this initial explosion. According tothis ‘big-bang’ model, the moment of the big bang markedthe beginning of the universe and the beginning of space andtime. If we want to know what happened before that moment,we run-again-into severe difficulties of thought and language.-It-r the words of Sir Bernard Lovell,There we reach the great barrier of thought because webegin to struggle with the concepts of time and spacebefore they existed in terms of our everyday experience.I feel as though I’ve suddenly driven into a great fogbarrier where the familiar world has disappeared.gAs far as the future of the expanding universe is concerned,Einstein’s equations do not provide a unique answer. Theyallow for several different solutions corresponding to differentmodels of the universe. Some models predict that the expansionwill continue for ever; according to others, it is slowing downand will eventually change into a contraction. These modelsdescribe an oscillating universe, expanding for billions ofyears, then contracting until its total mass has condensed intoa small ball of matter, then expanding again, and so on withoutend.This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe,which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions,has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancientIndian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic andrhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to developevolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modernscientific models. One of these cosmologies is based on theHindu myth of /i/a-the divine play-in which Brahmantransforms himself into the world.* Lila is a rhythmic playwhich goes on in endless cycles, the One becoming themany and the many returning into the One. In the BhagavadCita, the god Krishna describes this rhythmic play of creationin the following words:*See p. 87"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"At the end of the night of time all things return to mynature; and when the new day of time begins I bring themagain into light.Thus through my nature I bring forth all creation andthis rolls around in the circles of time.But I am not bound by this vast work of creation. I am andI watch the drama of works.I watch and in its work of creation nature brings forth allthat moves and moves not: and thus the revolutions ofthe world go round.‘0The Hindu sages were not afraid to identify this rhythmicdivine play with the evolution of the cosmos as a whole. Theypictured the universe as periodically expanding and con-tracting and gave the name kalpa to the unimaginable timespan between the beginning and the end of one creation. Thescale of this ancient myth is indeed staggering; it has takenthe human mind more than two thousand years to come upagain with a similar concept.From the world of the very large, from the expanding cosmos,let us now return to the world of the infinitely small. Physics inthe twentieth century has been characterized by an ever-progressing penetration into this world of submicroscopicdimensions, down into the realms of atoms, nuclei and theirconstituents. This exploration of the submicroscopic worldhas been motivated by one basic question which has occupiedand stimulated human thought throughout the ages: what ismatter made of? Ever since the beginning of natural philosophy,man has speculated about this question, trying to find the‘basic stuff’ of which all matter is made; but only in our centuryhas it been possible to seek an answer by undertaking experi-ments. With the help of a highly sophisticated technology,physicists were able to explore first the structure of atoms,finding that they consisted of nuclei and electrons, and thenthe structure of the atomic nuclei which were found to consistof protons and neutrons, commonly called nucleons. In thelast two decades, they have gone yet another step farther and199TheDynamicUniverse"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"200have begun to investigate the structure of the nucleons-theTheconstituents of the atomic nuclei-which, again, do not seemTao ofto be the ultimate elementary particles, but seem to bePhysicscomposed of other entities.The first step in the penetration into ever deeper layers ofmatter-the exploration of the world of atoms-has led toseveral profound modifications of our view of matter whichhave been discussed in the previous chapters. The second stepwas the penetration of the world of atomic nuclei and theirconstituents, and it has forced us to change our views in away which is no less profound. In this world, we deal withdimensions which are a hundred thousand times smaller thanatomic dimensions, and consequently the particles confined tosuch small dimensions move considerably faster than thoseconfined to atomic structures. They move, in fact, so fast thatthey can only be described adequately in the framework ofthe special theory of relativity. To understand the propertiesand interactions of subatomic particles, it is thus necessary touse a framework which takes into account both quantumtheory and relativity theory, and it is relativity theory whichforces us to modify our view of matter once more.The characteristic feature of the relativistic framework is,as mentioned previously, that it unifies basic concepts whichseemed totally unrelated before. One of the most importantexamples is the equivalence of mass and energy which isexpressed mathematically by Einstein’s famous equationE=mc*. To understand the profound significance of thisequivalence, we first have to understand the meaning of energy,and the meaning of mass.Energy is one of the most important concepts used in thedescription of natural phenomena. As in everyday life, we saythat a body has energy when it has the capacity for doingwork. This energy can take a great variety of forms. It can beenergy of motion, energy of heat, gravitational energy, electricalenergy, chemical energy, and so on. Whatever the form is,it can be used to do work. A stone, for example, can be givengravitational energy by lifting it up to some height. Whenit is dropped from that height, its gravitational energy istransformed into energy of motion (‘kinetic energy’), and whenthe stone hits the ground it can do work by breaking some--"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"thing. Taking a more constructive example, electrical energyor chemical energy can be transformed into heat energy andused for domestic purposes. In physics, energy is alwaysassociated with some process, or some kind of activity, and itsfundamental importance lies in the fact that the total energyinvolved in a process is always conserved. It may change itsform in the most complicated way, but none of it can get lost.The conservation of energy is one of the most fundamentallaws of physics. It governs all known natural phenomena andno violation of the law has so far been observed.The mass of a body, on the other hand, is a measure of itsweight, i.e. of the pull of gravity on the body. Besides that, massmeasures the inertia of an object, i.e. its resistance againstbeing accelerated. Heavy objects are harder to acceleratethan light objects, a fact which is well known to anybody whohas ever pushed a car. In classical physics, mass was further-more associated with an indestructible material substance,i.e. with the ‘stuff’ of which all things were thought to be made.Like energy, it was believed to be rigorously conserved, so thatno mass could ever get lost.Now, relativity theory tells us that mass is nothing but aform of energy. Energy can not only take the various formsknown in classical physics, but can also be locked up in themass of an object. The amount of energy contained, forexample, in a particle is equal to the particle’s mass, m, timesc2, the square of the speed of light; thusOnce it is seen to be a form of energy, mass is no longerrequired to be indestructible, but can be transformed into otherforms of energy. This can happen when subatomic particlescollide with one another. In such collisions, particles can bedestroyed and the energy contained in their masses can betransformed into kinetic energy, and distributed among theother particles participating in the collision. Conversely, whenparticles collide with very high velocities, their kinetic energycan be used to form the masses of new particles. The photo-201TheDynamicUniverse"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"202TheTao ofPhysicsgraph below shows an extreme example of such a collision: aproton enters the bubble chamber from the left, knocks anelectron out of an atom (spiral track), and then collides withanother proton to create sixteen new particles in the collisionprocess.The creation and destruction of material particles is one ofthe most impressive consequences of the equivalence of massand energy. In the collision processes of high-energy physics,mass is no longer conserved. The colliding particles can bedestroyed and their masses may be transformed partly intothe masses, and partly into the kinetic energies of the newlycreated particles. Only the total energy involved in such aprocess, that is, the total kinetic energy plus the energycontained in all the masses, is conserved. The collisions ofsubatomic particles are our main tool to study their propertiesand the relation between mass and energy is essential fortheir description. It has been verified innumerable times andparticle physicists are completely familiar with the equivalenceof mass and energy; so familiar, in fact, that they measurethe masses of particles in the corresponding energy units.The discovery that mass is nothing but a form of energy hasforced us to modify our concept of a particle in an essentialway. In modern physics, mass is no longer associated with amaterial substance, and hence particles are not seen as con-sisting of any basic ‘stuff’, but as bundles of energy. Sinceenergy, however, is associated with activity, with processes,the implication is that the nature of subatomic particles is"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"intrinsically dynamic. To understand this better, we mustremember that these particles can only be conceived in re-lativistic terms, that is, in terms of a framework where space andtime are fused into a four-dimensional continuum. The particlesmust not be pictured as static three-dimensional objects, likebilliard balls or grains of sand, but rather as four-dimensionalentities in space-time. Their forms have to be understooddynamically, as forms in space and time. Subatomic particlesare dynamic patterns which have a space aspect and a timeaspect. Their space aspect makes them appear as objectswith a certain mass, their time aspect as processes involvingthe equivalent energy.These dynamic patterns, or ‘energy bundles’, form the stablenuclear, atomic and molecular structures which build upmatter and give it its macroscopic solid aspect, thus making usbelieve that it is made of some material substance. At themacroscopic level, this notion of substance is a useful approxi-mation, but at the atomic level it no longer makes sense. Atomsconsist of particles and these particles are not made of anymaterial stuff. When we observe them, we never see anysubstance; what we observe are dynamic patterns continuallychanging into one another-a continuous dance of energy.Quantum theory has shown that particles are not isolatedgrains of matter, but are probability patterns, interconnectionsin an inseparable cosmic web. Relativity theory, so to speak,has made these patterns come alive by revealing their in-trinsically dynamic character. It has shown that the activity ofmatter is the very essence of its being. The particles of thesubatomic world are not only active in the sense of movingaround very fast; they themselves are processes! The existenceof matter and its activity cannot be separated. They are butdifferent aspects of the same space-time reality.It has been argued in the previous chapter that the awarenessof the ‘interpenetration’ of space and time has led the Easternmystics to an intrinsically dynamic world view. A study of theirwritings reveals that they conceive the world not only in termsof movement, flow and change, but also seem to have a strongintuition for the ‘space-time’ character of material objectswhich is so typical of relativistic physics. Physicists have totake into account the unification of space and time when theyTheDynamicUniverse"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"204study the subatomic world and, consequently, they view theTheobjects of this world-the particles-not statically, butTao ofdynamically, in terms of energy, activity and processes. ThePhysicsEastern mystics, in their non-ordinary states of consciousness,seem to be aware of the interpenetration of space and time ata macroscopic level, and thus they see the macroscopicobjects in a way which is very similar to the physicists’ con-ception of subatomic particles. This is particularly striking inBuddhism. One of the principal teachings of the Buddha wasthat ‘all compounded things are impermanent’. In the originalPali version of this famous saying,” the term used for ‘things’is sankhara (Sanskrit: samskara), a word which means first of all‘an event’ or ‘a happening’-also ‘a deed’, ‘an act’-and onlysecondarily ‘an existing thing’. This clearly shows that Buddhistshaveadynamic conception of things asever-changing processes.In the words of D. T. Suzuki,Buddhists have conceived an object as an event and notas a thing or substance . . .The Buddhist conception of‘things’ as samskara (or sankhara), that is, as ‘deeds’, or‘events’, makes it clear that Buddhists understand ourexperience in terms of time and movement.12Like modern physicists, Buddhists see all objects as processesin a universal flux and deny the existence of any materialsubstance. This denial is one of the most characteristic featuresof all schools of Buddhist philosophy. It is also characteristic ofChinese thought which developed a similar view of things astransitory stages in the ever-flowing Tao and was more con-cerned with their interrelations than with their reduction to afundamental substance. While European philosophy tendedto find reality in substance,’ writes Joseph Needham, ‘Chinesephilosophy tended to find it in relation.“3In the dynamic world views of Eastern mysticism and ofmodern physics, then, there is no place for static shapes, orfor any material substance. The basic elements of the universeare dynamic patterns; transitory stages in the ‘constant flowof transformation and change’, as Chuang Tzu calls it.According to our present knowledge of matter, its basicpatterns are the subatomic particles, and the understanding of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"their properties and interactions is the principal aim of modernfundamental physics. We know today over two hundredparticles, most of them being created artificially in collisionprocesses and living only an extremely short time; far less thana millionth of a second! It is thus quite obvious that theseshort-lived particles represent merely transitory patterns ofdynamic processes. The main questions with regard to thesepatterns, or particles, are the following. What are their dis-tinguishing features? Are they composite and, if so, what dothey consist of or-better-what other patterns do theyinvolve? How do they interact with one another, i.e. what arethe forces between them? Lastly, if the particles themselvesare processes, what kind of processes are they?We have become aware that in particle physics all thesequestions are inseparably connected. Because of the relativisticnature of subatomic particles, we cannot understand theirproperties without understanding their mutual interactions,and because of the basjc interconnectedness of the subatomicworld we shall not understand any one particle before under-standing all the others. The following chapters will show howfar we have come in understanding the particles’ propertiesand interactions. Although we are still lacking a completequantum-relativistic theory of the subatomic world, severalpartial theories and models have been developed whichdescribe some aspects of this world very successfully. A dis-cussion of the most important of these models and theorieswill show that they all involve philosophical conceptions whichare in striking agreement with those in Eastern mysticism."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"14 EMPTINESSANDFORMThe classical, mechanistic world view was based on the notionof solid, indestructible particles moving in the void. Modernphysics has brought about a radical revision of this picture.It has led not only to a completely new notion of ‘particles’,but has also transformed the classical concept of the void in aprofound way. This transformation took place in the so-calledfield theories. It began with Einstein’s idea of associating thegravitational field with the geometry of space, and becameeven more pronounced when quantum theory and relativitytheory were combined to describe the force fields of subatomicparticles. In these ‘quantum field theories’, the distinctionbetween particles and the space surrounding them loses itsoriginal sharpness and the void is recognized as a dynamicquantity of paramount importance.The field concept was introduced in the nineteenth centuryby Faraday and Maxwell in their description of the forcesbetween electric charges and currents. An electric field is acondition in the space around a charged body which willproduce a force on any other charge in that space. Electricfields are thus created by charged bodies and their effectscan only be felt by charged bodies. Magnetic fields are pro-duced by charges in motion, i.e. by electric currents, and themagnetic forces resulting from them can be felt by othermoving charges.In classical electrodynamics, the theoryconstructed by Faraday and Maxwell, the fields are primaryphysical entities which can be studied without any referenceto material bodies. Vibrating electric and magnetic fields cantravel through space in the form of radio waves, light waves, orother kinds of electromagnetic radiation."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"208Relativity theory has made the structure of electrodynamics-Themuch more elegant by unifying the concepts of both chargesTao ofand currents and electric and magnetic fields. Since all motionPhysicsis relative, every charge can also appear as a current-in aframe of reference where it moves with respect to the observer-and consequently, its electric field can also appear as amagnetic field. In the relativistic formulation of electrodynamics,the two fields are thus unified into a single electromagneticfield.The concept of a field has been associated not only with theelectromagnetic force, but also with that other major force inthe large-scale world, the force of gravity. Gravitational fieldsare created and felt by all massive bodies, and the resultingforces are always forces of attraction, contrary to the electro-magnetic fields which are felt only by charged bodies andwhich give rise to attractive and repulsive forces. The properfield theory for the gravitational field is the general theory ofrelativity, and in this theory the influence of a massive body onthe surrounding space is more far-reaching than the corres-ponding influence of a charged body in electrodynamics.Again, the space around the object is ‘conditioned’ in such away that another object will feel a force, but this time theconditioning affects the geometry, and thus the very structureof space.Matter and empty space-the full and the void-were thetwo fundamentally distinct concepts on which the atomismof Democritus and of Newton was based. In general relativity,these two concepts can no longer be separated. Whereverthere is a massive body, there will also be a gravitational field,and this field will manifest itself as the curvature of the spacesurrounding that body. We must not think, however, that thefield fills the space and ‘curves’ it. The two cannot be distin-guished; the field is the curved space! In general relativity, thegravitational field and the structure, or geometry, of space areidentical. They are represented in Einstein’s field equations byone and the same mathematical quantity. In Einstein’s theory,then, matter cannot be separated from its field of gravity, andthe field of gravity cannot be separated from the curved space.Matter and space are thus seen to be inseparable and inter-dependent parts of a single whole."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Material objects not only determine the structure of thesurrounding space but are, in turn, influenced by their environ-ment in an essential way. According to the physicist andphilosopher Ernst Mach, the inertia of a material object-theobject’s resistance against being accelerated-is not anintrinsic property of matter, but a measure of its interactionwith all the rest of the universe. In Mach’s view, matter onlyhas inertia because there is other matter in the universe. Whena body rotates, its inertia produces centrifugal forces (used,for example, in a spin-drier to extract water from wet laundry),but these forces appear only because the body rotates ‘relativeto the fixed stars’, as Mach has put it. If those fixed stars weresuddenly to disappear, the inertia and the centrifugal forces ofthe rotating body would disappear with them.This conception of inertia, which has become known asMach’s principle, had a deep influence on Albert Einstein andwas his original motivation for constructing the general theoryof relativity. Due to the considerable mathematical com-plexity of Einstein’s theory, physicists have not yet been ableto agree whether it actually incorporates Mach’s principle ornot. Most physicists believe, however, that it should be incor-porated, in one way or another, into a complete theory ofgravity.Thus modern physics shows us once again-and this time atthe macroscopic level-that material objects are not distinctentities, but are inseparably linked to their environment; thattheir properties can only be understood in terms of theirinteraction with the rest of the world. According to Mach’sprinciple, this interaction reaches out to the universe at large,to the distant stars and galaxies. The basic unity of the cosmosmanifests itself, therefore, not only in the world of the verysmall but also in the world of the very large; a fact which isincreasingly acknowledged in modern astrophysics and cos-mology. In the words of the astronomer Fred Hoyle,Present-day developments in cosmology are coming tosuggest rather insistently that everyday conditions couldnot persist but for the distant parts of the Universe, that allour ideas of space and geometry would become entirelyinvalid if the distant parts of the Universe were taken209EmptinessandForm"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"210away. Our everyday experience even down to the smallestThedetails seems to be so closely integrated to the grand-scaleTao offeatures of the Universe that it is well-nigh impossible toPhysicscontemplate the two being separated,’The unity and interrelation between a material object andits environment, which is manifest on the macroscopicscale in the general theory of relativity, appears in an evenmore striking form at the subatomic level. Here, the ideas ofclassical field theory are combined with those of quantumtheory to describe the interactions between subatomicparticles. Such a combination has not yet been possible forthe gravitational interaction because of the complicatedmathematical form of Einstein’s theory of gravity; but the otherclassical field theory, electrodynamics, has been merged withquantum theory into a theory called ‘quantum electrodynamics’which describes all electromagnetic interactions between sub-atomic particles. This theory incorporates both quantumtheory and relativity theory. It was the first ‘quantum-relativistic’model of modern physics and is still the most successful.The striking new feature of quantum electrodynamics arisesfrom the combination of two concepts; that of the electro-magnetic field, and that of photons as the particle manifesta-tions of electromagnetic waves. Since photons are also electro-magnetic waves, and since these waves are vibrating fields,the photons must be manifestations of electromagnetic fields.Hence the concept of a ‘quantum field’, that is, of a field whichcan take the form of quanta, or particles. This is indeed anentirely new concept which has been extended to describeall subatomic particles and their interactions, each type ofparticle corresponding to a different field. In these ‘quantumfield theories’, the classical contrast between the solid particlesand the space surrounding them is completely overcome. Thequantum field is seen as the fundamental physical entity; acontinuous medium which is present everywhere in space.Particles are merely local condensations of the field; concentra-tions of energy which come and go, thereby losing their in-dividual character and dissolving into the underlying field.

Like Einstein, theEastern mystics consider this underlying entity as the onlyreality: all its phenomenal manifestations are seen as transitoryand illusory. This reality of the Eastern mystic cannot beidentified with the quantum field of the physicist because it isseen as the essence of a// phenomena in this world and,consequently, is beyond all concepts and ideas. The quantumfield, on the other hand, is a well-defined concept which onlyaccounts for some of the physical phenomena. Nevertheless,the intuition behind the physicist’s interpretation of the sub-atomic world, in terms of the quantum field, is closely paralleledby that of the Eastern mystic who interprets his or her experienceof the world in terms of an ultimate underlying reality. Sub-sequent to the emergence of the field concept, physicists haveattempted to unify the various fields into a single fundamentalfield which would incorporate all physical phenomena. Einstein,in particular, spent the last years of his life searching for such aunified field. The Brahman of the Hindus, like the Dharmakayaof the Buddhists and the Tao of the Taoists, can be seen,perhaps, as the ultimate unified field from which spring notonly the phenomena studied in physics, but all other phenomenaas well.In the Eastern view, the reality underlying all phenomena isbeyond all forms and defies all description and specification.It is therefore often said to be formless, empty or void. But thisemptiness is not to be taken for mere nothingness. It is, on thecontrary, the essence of all forms and the source of all life.Thus the Upanishads say,Brahman is life. Brahman is joy. Brahman is the Void . . .Joy, verily, that is the same as the Void.The Void, verily, that is the same as joy.3211EmptinessandForm"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"2121,IThe1Tao ofPhysicsBuddhists express the same idea when they call the ultimatereality Sunyata-‘Emptiness’, or ‘the Void-and affirm that itis a living Void which gives birth to all forms in the phenomenalworld. The Taoists ascribe a similar infinite and endless creativityto the Tao and, again, call it empty. The Tao of Heaven isempty and formless’ says the Kuan-tzq4 and Lao Tzu usesseveral metaphors to illustrate this emptiness. He often com-pares the Tao to a hollow valley, or to a vessel which is forever empty and thus has the potential of containing an infinityof things.In spite of using terms like empty and void, the Eastern sagesmake it clear that they do not mean ordinary emptiness whenthey talk about Brahman, Sunyata or Tao, but, on the contrary,a Void which has an infinite creative potential. Thus, the Voidof the Eastern mystics can easily be compared to the quantumfield of subatomic physics. Like the quantum field, it gives birthto an infinite variety of forms which it sustains and, eventually,reabsorbs. As the Upanishads say,Tranquil, let one worship ItAs that from which he came forth,As that into which he will be dissolved,As that in which he breathes.5The phenomenal manifestations of the mystical Void, likethe subatomic particles, are not static and permanent, butdynamic and transitory, coming into being and vanishing inone ceaseless dance of movement and energy. Like the sub-atomic world of the physicist, the phenomenal world of theEastern mystic is a world of samsara-of continuous birth anddeath. Being transient manifestations of the Void, the things inthis world do not have any fundamental identity. This is es-pecially emphasized in Buddhist philosophy which denies theexistence of any material substance and also holds that theidea of a constant ‘self’ undergoing successive experiences is anillusion. Buddhists have frequently compared this illusion of amaterial substance and an individual self to the phenomenonof a water wave, in which the up-and-down movement of thewater particles makes us believe that a ‘piece’ of water moves"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"over the surface.* It is interesting to note that physicists haveused the same analogy in the context of field theory to pointout the illusion of a material substance created by a movingparticle. Thus Hermann Weyl writes:According to the Field theory of matter1 a material particlesuch as an electron is merely a small domain of the electricalfield within which the field strength assumes enormouslyhigh values, indicating that a comparatively huge fieldenergy is concentrated in a very small space. Such anenergy knot, which by no means is clearly delineatedagainst the remaining field, propagates through emptyspace like a water wave across the surface of a lake; thereis no such thing as one and the same substance of whichthe electron consists at all times.6In Chinese philosophy, the field idea is not only implicit inthe notion of the Tao as being empty and formless, and yetproducing all forms, but is also expressed explicitly in theconcept of ch’i. This term played an important role in almostevery Chinese school of natural philosophy and was particularlyimportant in Neo-Confucianism; the school which attempteda synthesis of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism.**The wordch’i literally means ‘gas’ or ‘ether’, and was used in ancientChina to denote the vital breath or energy animating thecosmos. In the human body, the ‘pathways of ch’i’ are thebasis of traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of acupunctureis to stimulate the flow of ch’i through these channels. Theflow of ch’i is also the basis of the flowing movements of T’aiChi Ch’uan, the Taoist dance of the warrior.The Neo-Confucians developed a notion of ch’i which bearsthe most striking resemblance to the concept of the quantumfield in modern physics. Like the quantum field, ch’i is conceivedas a tenuous and non-perceptible form of matter which ispresent throughout space and can condense into solid materialobjects. In the words of Chang Tsai:*See page 152.** See p. 102.213EmptinessandForm"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"214When the ch’i condenses, its visibility becomes apparentTheso that there are then the shapes (of individual things).Tao ofWhen it disperses, its visibility is no longer apparent andPhysicsthere are no shapes. At the time of its condensation, canone say otherwise than that this is but temporary? Butat the time of its dispersing, can one hastily say that it isthen non-existent?’Thus ch’i condenses and disperses rhythmically, bringing forthall forms which eventually dissolve into the Void. As ChangTsai says again,The Great Void cannot but consist of ch’i; this ch’i cannotbut condense to form all things; and these things cannotbut become dispersed so as to form (once more) the GreatVoid.8As in quantum field theory, the field-or the ch’i-is notonly the underlying essence of all material objects, but alsocarries their mutual interactions in the form of waves. Thefollowing descriptions of the field concept in modern physicsby Walter Thirring, and of the Chinese view of the physicalworld by Joseph Needham, make the strong similarity apparent.Modern theoretical physics . . . has put our thinking aboutthe essence of matter in a different context. It has takenour gaze from the visible-the particles-to the under-lying entity, the field. The presence of matter is merely adisturbance of the perfect state of the field at that place;something accidental, one could almost say, merely a‘blemish’. Accordingiy, there are no simple laws describingthe forces between elementary particles .., Order andsymmetry must be sought in the underlying field.gThe Chinese physical universe in ancient and medievaltimes was a perfectly continuous whole.

Individual objects thus had theirintrinsic rhythms. And these were integrated . . . into thegeneral pattern of the harmony of the world.lOWith the concept of the quantum field, modern physics hasfound an unexpected answer to the old question of whethermatter consists of indivisible atoms or of an underlying con-tinuum. The field is a continuum which is present everywherein space and yet in its particle aspect has a discontinuous,‘granular’ structure. The two apparently contradictory conceptsare thus unified and seen to be merely different aspects of thesame reality. As always in a relativistic theory, the unificationof the two opposite concepts takes place in a dynamic way:the two aspects of matter transform themselves endlessly intoone another. Eastern mysticism emphasizes a similar dynamicunity between the Void and the forms which it creates. In thewords of Lama Govinda:The relationship of form and emptiness cannot be con-ceived as a state of mutually exclusive opposites, butonly as two aspects of the same reality, which co-exist andare in continual co-operation.11The fusion of these opposite concepts into a single wholehas been expressed in a Buddhist sutra in the celebratedwords:Form is emptiness, and emptiness is indeed form. Emptinessis not different from form, form is not different fromemptiness. What isform that isemptiness, what isemptinessthat is form.‘2The field theories of modern physics have led not only to anew view of subatomic particles but have also decisivelymodified our notions about the forces between these particles.The field concept was originally linked to the concept of force,and even in quantum field theory it is still associated with theforces between particles.

All they do is interact with the exchanged photons.The force is nothing but the collective macroscopic effect ofthese multiple photon exchanges. The concept of force istherefore no longer useful in subatomic physics. It is a classicalconcept which we associate (even if only subconsciously) withthe Newtonian idea of a force being felt over a distance. In thesubatomic world there are no such forces, but only inter-actions between particles, mediated through fields, that is,through other particles. Hence, physicists prefer to speak aboutinteractions, rather than about forces.According to quantum field theory, all interactions takeplace through the exchange of particles. In the case of electro-magnetic interactions, the exchanged particles are photons;nucleons, on the other hand, interact through the muchstronger nuclear force-or ‘strong interaction’-which mani-fests itself as the exchange of a new kind of particles called‘mesons’. There are many different types of mesons whichcan be exchanged between protons and neutrons. The closerthe nucleons are to each other, the more numerous and heavythe mesons they exchange. The interactions between nucleonsare thus linked to the properties of the exchanged mesons andthese, in turn, interact mutually through the exchange of otherparticles. For this reason, we shall not be able to understandthe nuclear force on a fundamental level without understandingthe whole spectrum of subatomic particles.In quantum field theory, all particle interactions can bepictured in space-time diagrams, and each diagram is associatedwith a mathematical expression which allows one to calculatethe probability for the corresponding process to occur. Theexact correspondence between the diagrams and the mathe-matical expressions was established in 1949 by Richard Feynman,since when the diagrams have been known as Feynmandiagrams. A crucial feature of the theory is the creation anddestruction of particles. For example, the photon in our diagramis created in the process of emission at point A, and is destroyedwhen it is absorbed at point B. Such a process can only beconceived in a relativistic theory where particles are not seen217EmptinessandForm"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"218TheTao ofPhysicsas indestructible objects, but rather as dynamic patternsinvolving a certain amount of energy which can be redistributedwhen new patterns are formed.The creation of a massive particle is only possible when theenergy corresponding to its mass is provided, for example, ina collision process.

In such cases, theexchange of massive mesons should therefore not be possible.Yet, these exchanges do take place. Two protons, for example,may exchange a ‘pi-meson’, or ‘pion’, whose mass is about oneseventh of the proton mass:exchange of a pion (71) betweentwo protons(p)"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The reasonwhy exchange processes of that kind can happen,in spite of the apparent lack of energy for creating the meson,is to be found in a ‘quantum effect’ connected with the un-certainty principle. As discussed previously,* subatomic eventsocurring within a short time span involve a large uncertaintyof energy. The exchange of mesons, i.e. their creation andsubsequent destruction, are events of that kind. They takeplace during such a short time that the uncertainty of energyis enough to allow for the creation of the mesons. These mesonsare called ‘virtual’ particles. They are different from the ‘real’mesons created in collision processes, because they can onlyexist during the period of time allowed by the uncertaintyprinciple. The heavier the mesons are (i.e. the more energy isrequired to create them), the shorter is the time allowed forthe exchange process. This is why nucleons can exchangeheavy mesons only when they are very close together. Theexchange of virtual photons, on the other hand, can take placeover indefinite distances because the photons, being massless,can be created with indefinitely small amounts of energy. Thisanalysis of nuclear and electromagnetic forces enabled HidekiYukawa in 1935 not only to predict the existence of the pion,twelve years before it was observed, but also approximately toestimate its mass from the range of the nuclear force.In quantum field theory, then, all interactions are picturedas the exchange of virtual particles. The stronger the inter-action, i.e. the stronger the resulting ‘force’ between theparticles, the higher the probability of such exchange processes;the more frequently will virtual particles be exchanged. Therole of virtual particles, however, is not limited to these inter-actions. One nucleon alone, for example, may very well emita virtual particle and reabsorb it shortly afterwards. Providedthe created meson disappears within the time allowed by theuncertainty principle, there is nothing to forbid such a process.The corresponding Feynman diagram for a neutron emittingand reabsorbing a pion is reproduced overleaf.The probability for such ‘self-interaction’ processes is veryhigh for nucleons because of their strong interaction. Thismeans that nucleons are, in fact, emitting and absorbing virtual*See p. 159219EmptinessandForm"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"220TheTao ofPhysicsfna neutron (n) emitting andreabsorbing a pionparticles all the time. According to field theory, they have tobe regarded as centres of continuous activity surrounded byclouds of virtual particles. The virtual mesons have to disappearvery shortly after their creation, which means they cannotmove very far away from the nucleon. The meson cloud isthus very small. Its outer regions are populated by light mesons(mostly pions), the heavier mesons having to be absorbed aftera much shorter time and therefore being confined to the innerparts of the cloud.Every nucleon is surrounded by such a cloud of virtualmesons which live only for an exceedingly short period oftime. However, virtual mesons may become real mesons underspecial circumstances. When a nucleon is hit by another particlemoving with a high velocity, some of the energy of motion ofthat particle may be transferred to a virtual meson to free itfrom the cloud. This is how real mesons are created in high-energy collisions. On the other hand, when two nucleonscome so near to each other that their meson clouds overlap,some of the virtual particles may not go back to be absorbedby the nucleon which originally created them, but may ‘jumpacross’ to be absorbed by the other nucleon. This is how theexchange processes arise which constitute the strong inter-actions."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"This picture shows clearly that the interactions betweenparticles, and thus the ‘forces’ between them, are determinedby the composition of their virtual clouds. The range of aninteraction, that is, the distance between the particles at whichthe interaction will set in, depends on the extension of thevirtual clouds, and the detailed form of the interaction willdepend on the properties of the particles present in the clouds.Thus the electromagnetic forces are due to the presence ofvirtual photons ‘within’ charged particles, whereas the stronginteractions between nucleons arise from the presence ofvirtual pions and other mesons ‘within’ the nucleons. In fieldtheory, the forces between particles appear as intrinsic pro-perties of the particles. Force and matter, the two conceptsthat were so sharply separated in Greek and Newtonian atomism,are now seen to have their common origin in the dynamicpatterns that we call particles.Such aview of forces is also characteristic of Eastern mysticismwhich regards motion and change as essential and intrinsicproperties of all things. ‘All rotating things’, says Chang Tsaiwith reference to the heavens, ‘have a spontaneous force andthus their motion is not imposed on them from outside’;13and in the I Ching we read,Rhe natural1 laws are not forces external to things, butrepresent the harmony of movement immanent in them.14This ancient Chinese description of forces as representing theharmony of movement within things seems particularly appro-priate in the light of quantum field theory, where the forcesbetween particles are seen as reflecting dynamic patterns(the virtual clouds) inherent in these particles.The field theories of modern physics force us to abandon theclassical distinction between material particles and the void.Einstein’s field theory of gravity and quantum field theory bothshow that particles cannot be separated from the spacesurrounding them. On the one hand, they determine thestructure of that space, whilst on the other hand they cannotbe regarded as isolated entities, but have to be seen as con-densations of a continuous field which is present throughout221EmptinessandForm"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"222TheTao ofPhysicsspace.

Here is a ‘vacuum diagram’for such a process: three particles-a proton (p), an antiprotonCp), and a pion (x)-are formed out of nothing and disappearagain into the vacuum.

From its role as an empty container of thephysical phenomena, the void has emerged as a dynamicquantity of utmost importance.

It hasshown that the constituents of atoms, the subatomic particles,are dynamic patterns which do not exist as isolated entities,but as integral parts of an inseparable network of interactions.These interactions involve a ceaseless flow of energy mani-festing itself as the exchange of particles; a dynamic interplayin which particles are created and destroyed without end ina continual variation of energy patterns. The particle inter-actions give rise to the stable structures which build up thematerial world, which again do not remain static, but oscillatein rhythmic movements. The whole universe is thus engagedin endless motion and activity; in a continual cosmic dance ofenergy.This dance involves an enormous variety of patterns but,surprisingly, they fall into a few distinct categories. The studyof the subatomic particles and their interactions thus revealsa great deal of order. All atoms, and consequently all forms ofmatter in our environment, are composed of only three massiveparticles: the proton, the neutron and the electron. A fourthparticle, the photon, is massless and represents the unit ofelectromagnetic radiation. The proton, the electron and thephoton are all stable particles, which means they live for everunless they become involved in a collision process where theycan be annihilated. The neutron, on the other hand, can dis-integrate spontaneously. This disintegration is called ‘betadecay’ and is the basic process of a certain type of radioactivity.It involves the transformation of the neutron into a proton,accompanied by the creation of an electron and a new typeof massless particle, called the neutrino.

The electrons whichare created in the process are emitted as a powerful radiationwhich is widely used in biology, medicine and industry. Theneutrinos, on the other hand, although emitted in equal number,are very difficult to detect because they have neither mass norelectric charge.As mentioned previously, there is an antiparticle for everyparticle, with equal mass but opposite charge. The photon isits own antiparticle; the antiparticle of the electron is calledthe positron; then there is an antiproton, an antineutron, andan antineutrino.

However, their lifetime has to be regarded in relationto their size which is also diminutive. When looked at in thisway, it can be seen that many of them live for a relatively longperiod, and that one millionth of a second is, in fact, an enormoustime span in the particle world.

They live for a considerably shortertime, decaying after a few ‘particle seconds’, so that they cannever travel farther than a few times their size. This meansthey cannot be seen in the bubble chamber; their existencecan only be inferred indirectlv. The tracks seen in bubblechamber pictures can only be traced by particles listed in thetable.All these particles can be created and annihilated in collisionprocesses; each one can also be exchanged as a virtual particleand thus contribute to the interaction between other particles.This would seem to result in a vast number of different particleinteractions, but fortunately, although we do not yet knowwhy, all these interactions seem to fall into four categorieswith markedly different interaction strengths:The strong interactionsThe electromagnetic interactionsThe weak interactionsThe gravitational interactionsAmong them, the electromagnetic and gravitational interactionsare the most familiar, because they are experienced in thelarge-scale world.

Electromagneticinteractions take place between all charged particles. They areresponsible for the chemical processes, and the formation ofall atomic and molecular structures. The strong Interactionshold the protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus.They constitute the nuclear force, by far the strongest of allforces in nature. Electrons, for example, are bound to theatomic nuclei by the electromagnetic force with energies ofabout ten units (called electron volts), whereas the nuclearforce holds protons and neutrons together with energies ofabout ten million units!The nucleons are not the only particles interacting throughthe strong interactions. In fact, the overwhelming majority arestrongly interacting particles. Of all the particles known today,only five (and their antiparticles) do not participate in thestrong interactions. These are the photon and the four ‘leptons’listed in the top part of the table. Thus all the particles fall intotwo broad groups: leptons and ‘hadrons’, or strongly inter-acting particles. The hadrons are further divided into ‘mesons’and ‘baryons’ which differ in various ways, one of them beingthat all baryons have distinct antiparticles, whereas a mesoncan be its own antiparticle.The leptons are involved in the fourth type of interactions,the weak interactions. These are so weak, and have such ashort range, that they cannot hold anything together, whereasthe other three give rise to binding forces-the strong inter-actions holding together the atomic nuclei, the electromagneticinteractions the atoms and molecules, and the gravitationalinteractions the planets, stars and galaxies. The weak inter-actions manifest themselves only in certain kinds of particlecollisions and in particle decays, such as the beta decaymentioned earlier.All interactions between hadrons are mediated by theexchange of other hadrons. It is these exchanges of massiveparticles that cause the strong interactions to have such ashort range.* They extend only over a distance of a few particlesizes and can therefore never build up a macroscopic force.Strong interactions are thus not experienced in the everyday*See p. 219229ThecosmicDance"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"230TheTao ofPhysicsworld. The electromagnetic interactions, on the other hand,are mediated by the exchange of massless photons and thustheir range is indefinitely long,* which is why the electric andmagnetic forces are encountered in the large-scale world.The gravitational interactions, too, are believed to be mediatedby a massless particle, called the ‘graviton’, but- they are soweak that it has not yet been possible to observe the graviton,although there is no serious reason to doubt its existence.The weak interactions, finally, have an extremely short range-much shorter than that of the strong interactions-and aretherefore assumed to be produced by the exchange of a veryheavy particle, called the ‘W-meson’. This hypothetical particleis believed to play a role analogous to that of the photon in theelectromagnetic interactions, except for its large mass.

The short distancebetween the creation of the A and its decay can be made out very clearly in thephotograph.

Subatomic particles occur inlarge numbers in the centre of the stars where collision pro-cesses similar to the ones studied in the accelerator laboratoriestake place naturally all the time. In some stars, these processesproduce an extremely strong electromagnetic radiation-inthe form of radio waves, light waves or X-rays-which is theastronomer’s primary source of information about the universe.Interstellar space, as well as the space between the galaxies,is thus filled with electromagnetic radiation of various fre-quencies, i.e. with photons of various energies.

According to field theory, each particle does indeed‘perpetually sing its song’, producing rhythmic patterns ofenergy (the virtual particles) in ‘dense and subtle forms’.The metaphor of the cosmic dance has found its most pro-found and beautiful expression in Hinduism in the image ofthe dancing god Shiva.

The dance of Shiva is the dancing universe; the ceaselessflow of energy going through an infinite variety of patternsthat melt into one another.Modern physics has shown that the rhythm of creation anddestruction is not only manifest in the turn of the seasons andin the birth and death of all living creatures, but is also thevery essence of inorganic matter. According to quantumfield theory, all interactions between the constituents of mattertake place through the emission and absorption of virtualparticles. More than that, the dance of creation and destructionis the basis of the very existence of matter, since all materialparticles ‘self-interact’ by emitting and reabsorbing virtualparticles. Modern physics has thus revealed that every sub-atomic particle not only performs an energy dance, but alsois an energy dance;a pulsating process of creation anddestruction.The patterns of this dance are an essential aspect of eachparticle’s nature and determine many of its properties. Forexample, the energy involved in the emission and absorption"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"of virtual particles is equivalent to a certain amount of masswhich contributes to the mass of the self-interacting particle.Different particles develop different patterns in their dance,requiring different amounts of energy, and hence have differentmasses.

It is not, however, arbitrary and chaotic, butfollows very definite and clear patterns. To begin with, allparticles of a given kind are completely identical; they haveexactly the same mass, electric charge, and other characteristicproperties. Furthermore, all charged particles carry electriccharges exactly equal (or opposite) to that of the electron, orcharges of exactly twicethat amount. The same is true of otherquantities that are characteristic attributes of the particles;they do not take arbitrary values but are restricted to a limitednumber, which allows us to arrange the particles into a fewdistinct groups, or ‘families’. This leads to the question of howthese definite patterns arise in the dynamic and ever-changingparticle world,The emergence of clear patterns in the structure of matteris not a new phenomenon, but was already observed in theworld of atoms. Like subatomic particles, atoms of a givenkind are completely identical and the different kinds of atoms,of chemical elements, have been arranged into several groupsin the periodic table. This classification is now well understood;it is based on the number of protons and neutrons present inthe atomic nuclei and on the distribution of the electrons inspherical orbits, or ‘shells’, around the nuclei. As discussedpreviously,* the wave nature of the electrons restricts themutual distance of their orbits and the amount of rotation anelectron can have in a given orbit to a few definite valuescorresponding to specific vibrations of the electron waves."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"248Consequently, definite patterns arise in the atomic structureThewhich are characterized by a set of integral ‘quantum numbers’Tao ofand reflect the vibration patterns of the electron waves in theirPhysicsatomic orbits.

Thus thebaryons can only have spins of l/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc., whereas themesons have spins of 0, 1, 2, etc. This is strongly reminiscent ofthe amounts of rotation electrons are known to display in theiratomic orbits, which are also restricted to definite valuesspecified by integral numbers.The analogy to the atomic patterns is further enforced bythe fact that all strongly interacting particles, or hadrons, seemto fall into sequences whose members have identical propertiesexcept for their masses and spins. The higher members of thesesequences are the extremely short-lived particles called‘resonances’ which have been discovered in great numbersover the past decade. The masses and spins of the resonancesincrease in a well-defined way within each sequence, whichseem to extend indefinitely. These regularities suggest ananalogy to the excited states of atoms and have led physiciststo see the higher members of a hadron sequence not as differentparticles, but merely as excited states of the member with thelowest mass. Like an atom, a hadron can thus exist in variousshort-lived excited states involving higher amounts of rotation(or spin) and energy (or mass).The similarities between the quantum states of atoms andhadrons suggest that hadrons, too, are composite objects withinternal structures that are capable of being ‘excited, that is,of absorbing energy to form a variety of patterns. At present,however, we do not understand how these patterns are formed.In atomic physics, they can be explained in terms of theproperties and mutual interactions of the atom’s constituents(the protons, neutrons and electrons), but in particle physicssuch an explanation has not yet been possible.

The only way to find out what the‘constituents’ of these particles are is to break them up bybanging them together in collision processes involving highenergies. When this is done, however, the resulting fragmentsare never ‘smaller pieces’ of the original particles. Two protons,for example, can break up into a great variety of fragmentswhen they collide with high velocities, but there will never be‘fractions of a proton’ among them. The fragments will alwaysbe entire hadrons which are formed out of the kinetic energiesand masses of the colliding protons. The decomposition of aparticle into its ‘constituents’ is thus far from being definite,depending, as it does, on the energy involved in the collisionprocess. We are dealing here with a crucially relativistic situationwhere dynamic energy patterns are dissolved and rearranged,and the static concepts of composite objects and constituentparts cannot be applied to these patterns. The ‘structure’ of asubatomic particle can only be understood in a dynamicsense; in terms of processes and interactions.The way in which particles break up into fragments in col-lision processes is determined by certain rules, and as thefragments are again particles of the same kind, these rules canalso be used to describe the regularities which can be observedin the particle world. In the ‘sixties, when most of the presentlyknown particles were discovered and ‘families’ of particlesbegan to appear,most physicists-quite naturally-con-centrated their efforts on mapping out the emerging regularities,rather than tackling the arduous problem of finding the dynamiccauses of the particle patterns. And in doing so, they were verysuccessful.The notion of symmetry played an important role in thisresearch. By generalizing the common concept of symmetryand giving it a more abstract meaning, physicists were able todevelop it into a powerful tool which proved extremely usefulin the classification of particles.

Theshape of the Chinese yin-yang diagram, for example, is basedon such a rotational symmetry.In particle physics, symmetries are associated with manyother operations besides reflections and rotations, and thesecan take place not only in ordinary space (and time), but alsoin abstract mathematical spaces. They are applied to particles,or groups of particles, and since the particles’ properties areinseparably linked to their mutual interactions, the symmetriesalso apply to the interactions, i.e. to the processes in whichthe particles are involved. The reason that these symmetryoperations are so useful lies in the fact that they are closelyrelated to ‘conservation laws’. Whenever a process in theparticle world displays a certain symmetry, there is a measurablequantity which is ‘conserved’; a quantity, that is, whichremains constant during the process. These quantities provideelements of constancy in the complex dance of subatomicmatter and are thus ideal to describe the particle interactions.Some quantities are conserved in all interactions, others onlyin some of them, so that each process is associated with a setof conserved quantities. Thus the symmetries in the particles’properties appear as conservation laws in their interactions.Physicists use tne two concepts interchangeably, referringsometimes to the symmetry of a process, sometimes to the251QuarkSymmetries"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"252corresponding conservation law, whichever is more convenientThein the particular case.Tao ofThere are four basic conservation laws which seem to bePhysicsobserved in all processes, three of them being connected withsimple symmetry operations in ordinary space and time. Allparticle interactions are symmetric with respect to displace-ments in space-they will look exactly the same whether theytake place in London or in New York. They are also symmetricwith respect to displacements in time, which means they willoccur in the same way on a Monday or on a Wednesday. Thefirst of these symmetries is connected with the conservationof momentum, the second with the conservation of energy.This means that the total momentum of all particles involvedin an interaction, and their total energy (including all theirmasses), will be exactly the same before and after the inter-action. The third basic symmetry is one with respect to orienta-tion in space. In a particle collision, for example, it does notmake any difference whether the colliding particles approacheach other along an axis oriented north-south or east-west.As a consequence of this symmetry, the total amount of rotationinvolved in a process (which includes the spins of the individualparticles) is always conserved. Finally, there is the conservationof electric charge. It is connected with a more complicatedsymmetry operation, but in its formulation as a conservationlaw it is very simple: the total charge carried by all particlesinvolved in an interaction remains constant.There are several more conservation laws which correspondto symmetry operations in abstract mathematical spaces, likethe one connected with charge conservation. Some of themhold for all interactions, as far as we know, others only forsome of them (e.g. for strong and electromagn.etic interactions,but not for weak interactions).

These entities have been giventhe fanciful name ‘quarks’ by Murray Cell-Mann who referredhis fellow physicists to the line in James Joyce’s Finnegan’sWake, ‘Three quarks for Muster Mark’, when he postulatedtheir existence. Cell-Mann succeeded in accounting for alarge number of hadron patterns, such as the octets and thedecuplet discussed above, by assigning appropriate quantumnumbers to his three quarks and their antiquarks, and thenputting these building blocks together in various combinationsto form baryons and mesons whose quantum numbers areobtained simply by adding those of their constituent quarks.In this sense, baryons can be said to ‘consist of’ three quarks,their antiparticles of the corresponding antiquarks, andmesons of a quark plus an antiquark.The simplicity and efficiency of this model is striking, but itleads to severe difficulties if quarks are taken seriously as actualphysical constituents of hadrons. So far, no hadrons have everbeen broken up into their constituent quarks, in spite ofbombarding them with the highest energies available, whichmeans that quarks would have to be held together by extremelystrong binding forces. According to our present understandingof particles and their interactions, these forces can only manifestthemselves through the exchange of other particles, andconsequently these other particles, too, would be presentinside each hadron. If this were so, however, they would alsocontribute to the hadron’s properties and thus destroy thesimple additive scheme of the quark model.In other words, if quarks are held together by strong inter-action forces, these must involve other particles and the quarksmust consequently show some kind of ‘structure’, just like allthe other strongly interacting particles. For the quark model,however, it is essential to have pointlike, structureless quarks.Because of this fundamental difficulty, it has so far not beenpossible to formulate the quark model in a consistent dynamicway which accounts for the symmetries and for the bindingforces.On the experimental side, there has been a fierce but, so255QuarkSymmetries"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"256TheTao ofPhysicsfar, unsuccessful ‘hunt for the quark over the past decade.If single quarks exist, they should be quite conspicuous becauseCell-Mann’s model requires them to possess some very unusualproperties, like electric charges of l/3 and 2/3 of that of theelectron, which do not appear anywhere in the particle world.So far, no particles with these properties have been observedin spite of the most intensive search. This persistent failure todetect them experimentally, plus the serious theoretical ob-jections to their existence, have made the reality of quarksextremely doubtful.On the other hand, the quark model continues to be verysuccessful in accounting for the regularities found in theparticle world, although it is no longer used in its originalsimple form. In Cell-Mann’s original model, all hadrons couldbe built from three kinds of quarks and their antiquarks, but inthe mean time physicists have had to postulate additionalquarks to account for the great variety of hadron patterns.Cell-Mann himself recently proposed that each quark canappear in three different varieties which he called-mostappropriately in a lecture in Paris-‘red, white, and blue quarks’.This increased the total number of quarks to nine, and sincethen three more quarks have been postulated,* which allowedone of the speakers at a recent physics conference to refer tothem facetiously as ‘the twelve observed quarks’.The great number of regularities that can be successfullydescribed in terms of these twelve quarks is truly impressive.There can be no doubt that hadrons exhibit ‘quark symmetries’,even though our present understanding of particles and inter-actions precludes the existence of physical quarks. At present,in the summer of 1974, the paradoxes surrounding the quarkmodel are becoming increasingly sharp. A great deal of experi-mental data support the quark model; others contradict itviolently. No one has ever seen a quark, and according ‘to ourbasic ideas about particle interactions quarks cannot exist. Yet,hadrons very often behave exactly as if they consisted ofpointlike elementary constituents.

The quark puzzle has all thetraits of a new koan which, in turn, could lead to a majorbreakthrough in our understanding of subatomic particles.The discovery of symmetric patterns in the particle world hasled many physicists to believe that these patterns reflect thefundamental laws of nature. During the past fifteen years, agreat deal of effort has been devoted to the search for anultimate ‘fundamental symmetry’ that would incorporate allknown particles and thus ‘explain’ the structure of matter. Thisaim reflects a philosophical attitude which has been inheritedfrom the ancient Greeks and cultivated throughout manycenturies. Symmetry, together with geometry, played animportant role in Greek science, philosophy and art, where itwas identified with beauty, harmony and perfection. Thus thePythagoreans regarded symmetric number patterns as theessence of all things; Plato believed that the atoms of the fourelements had the shapes of regular solids, and most Greekastronomers thought that the heavenly bodies moved incircles because the circle was the geometrical figure with thehighest degree of symmetry.The attitude of Eastern philosophy with regard to symmetryis in striking contrast to that of the ancient Greeks. Mysticaltraditions in the Far East frequently use symmetric patterns assymbols or as meditation devices, but the concept of symmetrydoes not seem to play any major role in their philosophy. Likegeometry, it is thought to be a construct of the mind, ratherthan a property of nature, and thus of no fundamental im-portance. Accordingly, many Eastern art forms have a strikingpredilection for asymmetry and often avoid all regular or geo-metrical shapes. The Zen-inspired paintings of China and Japan,often executed in the so-called ‘one-corner’ style, or theirregular arrangements of flagstones in Japanese gardens clearlyillustrate this aspect of Far-Eastern culture.It would seem, then, that the search for fundamental sym-metries in particle physics is part of our Hellenic heritage whichis, somehow, inconsistent with the general world view thatbegins to emerge from modern science.

The problem, ultimately, is how to take into accountsimultaneously quantum theory and relativity theory. Theparticle patterns seem to reflect the ‘quantum nature’ of theparticles, since similar patterns occur in the world of atoms.In particle physics, however, they cannot be explained as wavepatterns in the framework of quantum theory, because theenergies involved are so high that relativity theory has to beapplied. Only a ‘quantum-relativistic’ theory of particles,therefore, can be expected to account for the observedsymmetries.Quantum field theory was the ‘first model of that kind. Itgave an excellent description of the electromagnetic inter-actions between electrons and photons, but it is much lessappropriate for the description of strongly interacting particles.As more and more of these particles were discovered, physicistssoon realized that it was highly unsatisfactory to associate eachof them with a fundamental field, and when the particle worldrevealed itself as an increasingly complex tissue of inter-connected processes, they had to look for other models torepresent this dynamic and ever-changing reality. What wasneeded was a mathematical formalism which would be ableto describe in a dynamic way &great variety of hadronoatterns: their continual transformation into one another,their mutual interaction through the exchange of otherparticles, the formation of ‘bound states’ of two or morehadrons, and their decay into various particle combinations.All these processes, which are often given the general name"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"262‘particle reactions’,are essential features of the strong inter-Theactions and have to be accounted for in a quantum-relativisticTao ofmodel of hadrons.PhysicsThe framework which seems to be most appropriate for thedescription of hadrons and their interactions is called ‘S-matrixtheory’. Its key concept, the ‘S matrix’, was originally proposedby Heisenberg in 1943 and has been developed, over the pasttwo decades, into a complex mathematical structure whichseems to be ideally suited to describe the strong interactions.The S matrix is a collection of probabilities for all possiblereactions involving hadrons. It derives its name from the factthat one can imagine the whole assemblage of possible hadronreactions arranged in an infinite array of the kind mathe-maticians call a matrix. The letter S is a remainder of theoriginal name ‘scattering matrix’ which refers to collision-or‘scattering’-processes, the majority of particle reactions.In practice, of course, one is never interested in the entirecollection of hadron processes, but always in a few specificreactions. Therefore, one never deals with the whole S matrix,CxDABbut only with those of its parts, or ‘elements’, which refer to theprocesses under consideration. These are represented sym-bolically by diagrams like the one above which pictures one ofthe simplest and most general particle reactions: two particles,A and B, undergo a collision to emerge as two different particles,C and D. More complicated processes involve a greater numberof particles and are represented by diagrams like the following."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"It must be emphasized that these S-matrix diagrams are verydifferent from the Feynman diagrams of field theory. They donot picture the detailed mechanism of the reaction, but merelyspecify the initial and final particles. The standard processA+B+C+D, for example, might be pictured in field theoryas the exchange of a virtual particle V, whereas in S-matrixtheory, one simply draws a circle without specifying what goeson inside it. Furthermore, the S-matrix diagrams are not space-time diagrams, but more general symbolic representations ofparticle reactions. These reactions are not assumed to takeplace at definite points in space and time, but are described interms of the velocities (or, more precisely, in terms of themomenta) of the incoming and outgoing particles.This means, of course, that an S-matrix diagram containsmuch less information than a Feynman diagram. On the otherhand, S-matrix theory avoids a difficulty which is characteristicof field theory. The combined effects of quantum and relativitytheory make it impossible to localize an interaction betweendefinite particles precisely. Due to the uncertainty principle,the uncertainty of a particle’s velocity will increase as its regionof interaction is localized more sharply,* and consequently,the amount of its kinetic energy will be increasingly uncertain.Eventually, this energy will become large enough for newparticles to be created, in accordance with relativity theory,and then one can no longer be certain of dealing with theoriginal reaction. Therefore, in a theory which combines bothquantum and relativity theories, it is not possible to specifythe position of individual particles precisely. If this is done, asin field theory, one has to put up with mathematical incon-sistencies which are, indeed, the main problem in all quantumfield theories. S-matrix theory bypasses this problem by*See p. 157263PatternsofChange"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"264TheTao ofPhysicsspecifying the momenta of the particles and remaining suffi-ciently vague about the region in which the reaction occurs.The important new concept in S-matrix theory is the shift ofemphasis from objects to events; its basic concern is not withthe particles, but with their reactions. Such a shift from objectsto events is required both by quantum theory and by relativitytheory. On the one hand, quantum theory has made it clearthat a subatomic particle can only be understood as a mani-festation of the interaction between various processes ofmeasurement. It is not an isolated object but rather an occur-rence, or event, which interconnects other events in a particularway. In the words of Heisenberg:[In modern physicsl, one has now divided the world notinto different groups of objects but into different groupsof connections . . .What can be distinguished is the kindof connection which is primarily important in a certainphenomenon . . .The world thus appears as a complicatedtissue of events, in which connections of different kindsalternate or overlap or combine and thereby determinethe texture of the whole.’Relativity theory, on the other hand, has forced us to conceiveof particles in terms of space-time: as four-dimensional patterns,as processes rather than objects. The S-matrix approach com-bines both of these viewpoints. Using the four-dimensionalmathematical formalism of relativity theory, it describes allproperties of hadrons in terms of reactions (or, more precisely,in terms of reaction probabilities), and thus establishes anintimate link between particles and processes. Each reactioninvolves particles which link it to other reactions and thusbuild up a whole network of processes.A neutron, for example, may participate in two successivereactions involving different particles; the first, say, a protonand a z-, the second a Z- and a K+.The neutron thus inter-connects these two reactions and integrates them into a largerprocess (see diagram (a) opposite).

The interconnections in such a network cannot bedetermined with certainty, but are associated with probabilities.Each reaction occurs with some probability, which dependson the available energy and on the characteristics of thereaction, and these probabilities are given by the variouselements of the S matrix.This approach allows one to define the structure of a hadronin a thoroughly dynamic way.

The structure of a hadron, therefore, isnot understood as a definite arrangement of constituent parts,but is given by all sets of particles which may interact withone another to form the hadron under consideration. Thus aproton exists potentially as a neutron-pion pair, a kaon-lambdapair, and so on. The proton also has the potential of disintegratinginto any of these particle combinations if enough energy isavailable.

These rules are theconservation laws mentioned before; only those reactions canoccur in which a well-defined set of quantum numbers isconserved. To begin with, the total energy has to remainconstant in every reaction. This means that a certain combina-tion of particles can emerge from a reaction only if the energycarried into the reaction is high enough to provide the requiredmasses. Furthermore, the emerging group of .particles mustcollectively carry exactly the same quantum numbers thathave been carried into the reaction by the initial particles.For example, a proton and a X-, carrying a total electric chargeof zero, may be dissolved in a collision and rearranged toemerge as a neutron plus a n”, but they cannot emerge as aneutron and a z+, as this pair would carry a total charge of+1.The hadron reactions, then, represent a flow of energy inwhich particles are created and dissolved, but the energy canonly flow through certain ‘channels’ characterized by thequantum numbers conserved in the strong interactions. InS-matrix theory, the concept of a reaction channel is morefundamental than that of a particle. It is defined as a set of"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"quantum numbers which can be carried by various hadroncombinations and often also by a single hadron. Which com-bination of hadrons flows through a particular channel is amatter of probability but depends, first of all, on the availableenergy. The diagram opposite, for example, shows an inter-action between a proton and a n- in which a neutron is formedas an intermediate state. Thus, the reaction channel is madeup first by two hadrons, then by a single hadron, and finallyby the initial hadron pair. The same channel can be made up,if more energy is available, by a A-K0 pair, a Z--K+ pair, andby various other combinations.The notion of reaction channels is particularly appropriateto deal with resonances, those extremely short-lived hadronstates which are characteristic of all strong interactions. Theyare such ephemeral phenomena that physicists were firstreluctant to classify them as particles, and today the clarificationof their properties still constitutes one of the major tasks inexperimental high-energy physics. Resonances are formed inhadron collisions and disintegrate almost as soon as they comeinto being. They cannot be seen in the bubble chamber, butcan be detected due to a very special behaviour of reactionprobabilities. The probability for two colliding hadrons toundergo a reaction-to interact with one another-dependson the energy involved in the collision. If the amount of thisenergy is modified, the probability will also change; it mayincrease or decrease with increasing energy, depending on thedetails of the reaction. At certain values of energy, however,the reaction probability is observed to increase sharply; areaction is much more likely to occur at these values than atany other energy. This sharp increase is associated with theformation of a short-lived intermediate hadron with a masscorresponding to the energy at which the increase is observed.The reason why these short-lived hadron states are calledresonances is related to an analogy that can be drawn to thewell-known resonance phenomenon encountered in con-nection with vibrations. In the case of sound, for example, theair in a cavity will in general respond only weakly to a soundwave coming from outside, but will begin to ‘resonate’, orvibrate very strongly, when the sound wave reaches-a certainfrequency called the resonance frequency. The channel of a269PatternsofChange"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"270hadron reaction can be compared to such a resonant cavity,Thesince the energy of the colliding hadrons is related to theTao offrequency of the corresponding probability wave. When thisPhysicsenergy, or frequency, reaches a certain value the channelbegins to resonate;the vibrations of the probability wavesuddenly become very strong and thus cause a sharp increasein the reaction probability. Most reaction channels have severalresonance energies, each of them corresponding to the massof an ephemeral intermediate hadron state which is formedwhen the energy of the colliding particles reaches the resonancevalue.In the framework of S-matrix theory, the problem of whetherone should call the resonances ‘particles’ or not does notexist. All particles are seen as intermediate states in a networkof reactions, and the fact that the resonances live for a muchshorter period than other hadrons does not make them funda-mentally different. In fact, the word ‘resonance’ is a very appro-priate term. It applies both to the phenomenon in the reactionchannel and to the hadron which is formed during thatphenomenon, thus showing the intimate link between particlesand reactions. A resonance is a particle, but not an object.It is much better described as an event, an occurrence or ahappening.This description of hadrons in particle physics recalls tomind the words of D. T. Suzuki quoted above:* ‘Buddhistshave conceived an object as an event and not as a thing orsubstance.’What Buddhists have realized through theirmystical experience of nature has now been rediscoveredthrough the experiments and mathematical theories of modernscience.In order to describe all hadrons as intermediate states in anetwork of reactions, one has to be able to account for theforces through which they mutually interact. These are thestrong-interation forces which deflect, or ‘scatter’, collidinghadrons, dissolve and rearrange them in different patterns, andbind groups of them together to form intermediate boundstates. In S-matrix theory, as in field theory, the interaction*See p. 204."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"1forces are associated with particles, but the concept of virtualparticles is not used. Instead, the relation between forces andparticles is based on a special property of the S matrix knownas ‘crossing’.

This isbecause ‘crossing’ is an essentially relativistic concept arisingin the context of the four-dimensional formalism of relativitytheory, and thus very difficult to visualize.

In both theories, the forces manifest themselvesas particles whose mass determines the range of the force,**and in both theories they are recognized as intrinsic propertiesof the interacting particles; they reflect the structure of theparticles’ virtual clouds in field theory, and are generated bybound states of the interacting particles in S-matrix theory.The parallel to the Eastern view of forces discussed previously***applies thus to both theories. This view of interaction forces,furthermore, implies the important conclusion that all knownparticles must have some internal structure, because only thencan they interact with the observer and thus be detected.

The mereknowledge of a particle’s existence, that is to say, implies thatthe particle possesses internal structureY2A particular advantage of the S-matrix formalism is the factthat it is able to describe the ‘exchange’ of a whole family ofhadrons. As mentioned in the previous chapter, all hadronsseem to fall into sequences whose members have identicalproperties except for their masses and spins. A formalismproposed originally by Tullio Regge makes it possible to treateach of these sequences as a single hadron existing in variousexcited states. In recent years, it has been possible to incorporatethe Regge formalism into the S-matrix framework where it hasbeen used very successfully for the description of hadronreactions. This has been one of the most important develop-ments in S-matrix theory and can be seen as a first step towardsa dynamic explanation of particle patterns.The framework of the S matrix, then, is able to describe thestructure of hadrons, the forces through which they mutuallyinteract, and some of the patterns they form, in a thoroughlydynamic way in which each hadron is understood as anintegral part of an inseparable network of reactions. The mainchallenge, and so far unsolved problem, in S-matrix theory isto use this dynamic description to account for the symmetrieswhich give rise to the hadron patterns and conservation lawsdiscussed in the previous chapter. In such a theory, the hadronsymmetries would be reflected in the mathematical structureof the S matrix in such a way that it contains only elementswhich correspond to reactions allowed by the conservationlaws. These laws would then no longer have the status ofempirical regularities but would be a consequence of theS-matrix structure, and thus a consequence of the dynamicnature of hadrons.At present, physicists are trying to achieve this ambitiousaim by postulating several general principles which restrict themathematical possibilities of constructing S-matrix elementsand thus give the S matrix a definite structure. So far, three of"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"these general principles have been established. The first issuggested by relativity theory and by our macroscopic ex-perience of space and time. It says that the reaction probabilities(and thus the S-matrix elements) must be independent of dis-placements of the experimental apparatus in space and time,independent of its orientation in space, and independent ofthe state of motion of the observer. As discussed in the previouschapter, the independence of a particle reaction with regardto changes of orientation and displacements in space and timeimplies the conservation of the total amount of rotation,momentum and energy involved in the reaction. These‘symmetries’ are essential for our scientific work. If the resultsof an experiment changed according to where and when itwas performed, science in its present form would be impossible.The last requirement, finally-that the experimental resultsmust not depend on the observer’s motion-is the principleof relativity which is the basis of relativity theory.*The second general principle is suggested by quantumtheory. It asserts that the outcome of a particular reaction canonly be predicted in terms of probabilities and, furthermore,that the sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes-including the case of no interaction between the particles-must be equal to one. In other words, we can be certain thatthe particles will either interact with one another, or not. Thisseemingly trivial statement turns out to be, in fact, a verypowerful principle, known under the name of ‘unitarity’, whichseverely restricts the possibilities of constructing S-matrixelements.The third and final principle is related to our notions of causeand effect and is known as the principle of causality. It statesthat energy and momentum are transferred over spatialdistances only. by particles, and that this transfer occurs insuch a way that a particle can be created in one reaction anddestroyed in another only if the latter reaction occurs afterthe former. The mathematical formulation of the causalityprinciple implies that the S matrix depends in a smooth wayon the energies and momenta of the particles involved in areaction, except for those values at which the creation of new*See p. 167275PatternsofChange"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"276ITheTao ofPhysicsparticles becomes possible. At those values, the mathematicalstructure of the S matrix changes abruptly; it encounters whatmathematicians call a ‘singularity’. Each reaction channelcontains several of these singularities, that is, there are severalvalues of energy and momentum in each channel at whichnew particles can be created. The ‘resonance energies’ men-tioned before are examples of such values.The fact that the S matrix exhibits singularities is a con-sequence of the causality principle, but the location of thesingularities is not determined by it. The values of energy andmomentum at which particles can be created are different fordifferent reaction channels and depend on the masses andother properties of the created particles. The locations of thesingularities thus reflect the properties of these particles, andsince all hadrons can be created in particle reactions, thesingularities of the S matrix mirror all the patterns and sym-metries of hadrons.The central aim of S-matrix theory is, therefore, to derive thesingularity structure of the S matrix from the general principles.Up to now, it has not been possible to construct a mathematicalmodel which satisfies all three principles, and it may well bethat they are sufficient to determine all the properties of the Smatrix-and thus all the properties of hadrons-uniquely.*If this turns out to be the case, the philosophical implicationsof such a theory would be very profound. All three of thegeneral principles are related to our methods of observationand measurement, that is, to the scientific framework. If theyare sufficient to determine the structure of hadrons, this wouldmean that ‘the basic structures of the physical world aredetermined, ultimately, by the way in which we look at thisworld.

It implies, ultimately,that the structures and phenomena we observe in nature arenothing but creations of our measuring and categorizingmind.That this is so is one of the fundamental tenets of Easternphilosophy. The Eastern mystics tell us again and again that allthings and events we perceive are creations of the mind,arising from a particular state of consciousness and dissolvingagain if this state is transcended. Hinduism holds that all shapesand structures around us are created by a mind under thespell of maya, and it regards our tendency to attach deepsignificance to them as the basic human illusion. Buddhists callthis illusion avidya, or ignorance, and see it as the state of a‘defiled’ mind. In the words of Ashvaghosha,When the oneness of the totality of things is not recognised,then ignorance as well as particularisation arises, and allphases of the defiled mind are thus developed . . . Allphenomena in the world are nothing but the illusorymanifestation of the mind and have no reality on theirown.3This is also the recurring theme of the Buddhist Yogacaraschool which holds that all forms we perceive are ‘mind only’;projections, or ‘shadows’, of the mind:Out of mind spring innumerable things, conditioned bydiscrimination. . .These things people accept as anexternal world . . .What appears to be external does notexist in reality; it is indeed mind that is seen as multiplicity;the body, property, and above-all these, I say, arenothing but mind.4In particle physics, the derivation of the hadron patterns fromthe general principles of S-matrix theory is a long and arduoustask, and so far only a few small steps have been taken towardsachieving it. Furthermore, the theory in its present formcannot be applied to the electromagnetic interactions that*Seep.140--277PatternsofChange"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"278TheTao ofPhysicsgive rise to the atomic structures and dominate the world ofchemistry and biology. Nevertheless, the possibility that thehadron patterns will some day be derived from the generalprinciples, and thus be seen to depend on our scientificframework, must be taken seriously. It is an exciting con-jecture that this may be a general feature of particle physicswhich will also appear in future theories of electromagnetic,weak, and gravitational interactions. If this turns out to betrue, modern physics will have come a long way towardsagreeing with the Eastern sages that the structures of thephysical world are maya, or ‘mind only’.S-matrix theory comes very close to Eastern thought notonly in its ultimate conclusion, but also in its general view ofmatter. It describes the world of subatomic particles as adynamic network of events and emphasizes change and trans-formation rather than fundamental structures or entities. Inthe East, such an emphasis is particularly strong in Buddhistthought where all things are seen as dynamic, impermanentand illusory. Thus S. Radhakrishnan writes:How do we come to think of things, rather than of pro-cesses in this absolute flux? By shutting our eyes to thesuccessive events. It is an artificial attitude that makessections in the stream of change, and calls them things . . .When we shall know the truth of things, we shall realisehow absurd it is for us to worship isolated products of theincessant series of transformations as though they wereeternal and real. Life is no thing or state of a thing, buItcontinuous movement or change.5Both the modern physicist and the Eastern mystictrealized that all phenomena in this world of changetransformation are dynamically interrelated. HindusahaveandBuddhists see this interrelation as a cosmic law, the law ofkarma, but they are generally not concerned with any specificpatterns in the universal network of events. Chinese philosophy,on the other hand, which also emphasizes movement andchange, has developed the notion of dynamic patterns whichare continually formed and dissolved again in the cosmic flowof the Tao.

They were givennames reflecting their basic characteristics-such as TheCreative’, The Receptive’, ‘The Arousing’, etc.-and they wereassociated with many images taken from nature and from sociallife.

These situations, therefore, are not seen asstatic, but rather as stages in a continuous flow and change.This is the basic idea of the Book of Changes which is expressedin its very title. All things and situations in the world are subjectto change and transformation, and so are their images, thetrigrams and hexagrams. They are in a state of continualtransition; one changing into another, solid lines pushingoutwards and breaking in two, broken lines pushing inwardsand growing together.Because of its notion of dynamic patterns, generated bychange and transformation, the I Ching is perhaps the closestanalogy to S-matrix theory in Eastern thought. In both systems,the emphasis is on processes rather than objects. In S-matrixtheory, these processes are the particle reactions that give riseto all the phenomena in the world of hadrons. In the I Ching,the basic processes are called ‘the changes’ and are seen asessential for an understanding of all natural phenomena:~~ .=7281PatternsofChange"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"282TheTao ofPhysicsThe changes are what has enabled the holy sages toreach all depths and to grasp the seeds of all things6These changes are not regarded as fundamental laws imposedon the physical world, but rather-in the words of HellmutWilhelm-as ‘an inner tendency according to which develop-ment takes place naturally and spontaneously’.7 The same canbe said of the ‘changes’ in the particle world. They, too, reflectthe inner tendencies of the particles which are expressed, inS-matrix theory, in terms of reaction probabilities.The changes in the world of hadrons give rise to structuresand symmetric patterns which are represented symbolicallyby the reaction channels. Neither the structures nor thesymmetries are regarded as fundamental features of thehadron world, but are seen as consequences of the particles’dynamic nature, that is, of their tendencies for change andtransformation.In the I Ching, too, the changes give rise to structures-thetrigrams and hexagrams.

Asthe energy flows through the reaction channels, the ‘changes’flow through the lines of the hexagrams:Alteration, movement without rest,Flowing through the six empty places,Rising and sinking without fixed law,It is only change that is at work here!In the Chinese view, all things and phenomena around usarise out of the patterns of change and are represented by thevarious lines of the trigrams and hexagrams.

The important point, how:ever, is not this accidental similarity, but the fact that bothmodern physics and ancient Chinese thought consider changeand transformation as the primary aspect of nature, and seethe structures and symmetries generated by the changes assecondary. As he explains in the introduction to his translation’of the I Ching, Richard Wilhelm regards this idea as the funda-mental concept of the Book of Changes:The eight trigrams . . .were held to be in a state of continualtransition, one changing into another, just as transitionfrom one phenomenon to another is continually takingplace in the physical world.

In the past, this conceptwas extremely successful in explaining the physical world interms of a few atoms; the structures of the atoms in terms ofa few nuclei surrounded by electrons; and finally, the structuresof the nuclei in terms of two nuclear ‘building blocks’, theproton and the neutron. Thus atoms, nuclei and hadrons were,in turn, considered to be ‘elementary particles’. None of them,however, fulfilled that expectation. Each time, these particlesturned out to be composite structures themselves, andphysicists hoped that the next generation of constituents wouldfinally reveal themselves as the ultimate components of matter.On the other hand, the theories of atomic and subatomicphysics made the existence of elementary particles increasinglyunlikely. They revealed a basic interconnection of matter,showing that energy of motion can be transformed into mass,and suggesting that particles are processes rather than objects.All these developments strongly indicated that the simplemechanistic picture of basic building blocks had to be aban-doned, and yet many physicists are still reluctant to do so.The age-old tradition of explaining complex structures bybreaking them down into simpler constituents is so deeplyingrained in Western thought that the search for these basiccomponents is still going on.There is, however, a radically different school of thought inparticle physics which starts from the idea that nature cannotbe reduced to fundamental entities, such as elementary particlesor fundamental fields.

This idea has arisen inTao ofthe context of S-matrix theory and is known as the ‘bootstrap’Physicshypothesis. Its originator and main advocate is Geoffrey Chewwho, on the one hand, has developed the idea into a general‘bootstrap’ philosophy of nature and, on the other, has usedit (in collaboration with other physicists) to construct specificmodels of particles formulated in S-matrix language. Chew hasdescribed the bootstrap hypothesis in several articles’ whichprovide the basis for the following presentation.The bootstrap philosophy constitutes the final rejection ofthe mechanistic world view in modern physics. Newton’suniverse was constructed from a set of basic entities withcertain fundamental properties, which had been created byGod and thus were not amenable to further analysis. In oneway or another, this notion was implicit in all theories ofnatural science until the bootstrap hypothesis stated explicitlythat the world cannot be understood as an assemblage ofentities which cannot be analysed further. In the new worldview, the universe is seen as a dynamic web of interrelatedevents. None of the properties of any part of this web is funda-mental; they all follow from the properties of the other parts,and the overall consistency of their mutual interrelationsdetermines the structure of the entire web.Thus, the bootstrap philosophy represents the culminationof a view of nature that arose in quantum theory with therealization of an essential and universal interrelationship,acquired its dynamic content in relativity theory, and wasformulated in terms of reaction probabilities in S-matrix theory.At the same time, this view of nature came ever closer to theEastern world view and is now in harmony with Eastern thought,both in its general philosophy and in its specific picture ofmatter.The bootstrap hypothesis not only denies the existence offundamental constituents of matter, but accepts no funda-mental entities whatsoever-no fundamental laws, equationsor principles-and thus abandons another idea which hasbeen an essential part of natural science for hundreds of years.The notion of fundamental laws of nature was derived fromthe belief in a divine lawgiver which was deeply rooted in the"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Judaeo-Christian tradition. In the words of Thomas Aquinas:There is a certain Eternal Law, to wit, Reason, existing inthe mind of Cod and governing the whole universe.*This notion of an eternal, divine law of nature greatly influencedWestern philosophy and science. Descartes wrote about the‘laws which Cod has put into nature’, and Newton believedthat the highest aim of his scientific work was to give evidenceof the ‘laws impressed upon nature by Cod’. To discover theultimate fundamental laws of nature remained the aim ofnatural scientistsfor the three centuries following Newton.In modern physics, a very different attitude has now developed.Physicists have come to see that all their theories of naturalphenomena, including the ‘laws’ they describe, are creationsof the human mind; properties of our conceptual map ofreality, rather than of reality itself. This conceptual scheme isnecessarily limited and approximate,* as are all the scientifictheories and ‘laws of nature’ it contains. All natural phenomenaare ultimately interconnected, and in order to explain any oneof them we need to understand all the others, which is obviouslyimpossible. What makes science so successful is the discoverythat approximations are possible. If one is satisfied with anapproximate ‘understanding’ of nature, one can describeselected groups of phenomena in this way, neglecting otherphenomena which are less relevant. Thus one can explainmany phenomena in terms of a few, and consequently under-stand different aspects of nature in an approximate way withouthaving to understand everything at once. This is the scientificmethod; all scientific theories and models are approximationsto the true nature of things, but the error involved in theapproximation is often small enough to make such an approachmeaningful. In particle physics, for example, the gravitationalinteraction forces between particles are usually ignored, asthey are many orders of magnitude weaker than those of theother interactions. Although the error caused by this omissionis exceedingly small, it is clear that the gravitational interactionswill have to be included in future, more accurate theories ofparticles.Thus physicists construct a sequence of partial and approxi-‘See pp. 28,4-l287Inter-penetration"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"288mate theories, each of them being more accurate than theTheprevious one, but none of them representing a complete andTao offinal account of natural phenomena. Like these theories, allPhysicsthe ‘laws of nature’ they describe are mutable, destined to bereplaced by more accurate laws when the theories are improved.The incomplete character of a theory is usually reflected in itsarbitrary parameters or ‘fundamental constants’, that is, inquantities whose numerical values are not explained by thetheory, but have to be inserted into it after they have beendetermined empirically. Quantum theory cannot explain thevalue used for the mass of the electron, nor field theory themagnitude of the electron’s charge, or relativity theory that ofthe speed of light. In the classical view, these quantities wereregarded as fundamental constants of nature which did notrequire any further explanation. In the modern view, their roleof ‘fundamental constants’ is seen as temporary and reflectingthe limitations of the present theories. According to the boot-strap philosophy, they should be explained, one by one, infuture theories as the accuracy and scope of these theoriesincrease. Thus the ideal situation should be approached, butmay never be reached, where the theory does not containany unexplained ‘fundamental’ constants, and. where all its‘laws’ follow from the requirement of overall self-consistency.It is important to realize, however, that even such an idealtheory must possess some unexplained features, although notnecessarily in the form of numerical constants. As long as it isa scientific theory, it will require the acceptance, withoutexplanation, of certain concepts which form the scientificlanguage. To push the bootstrap idea further would leadbeyond science:In the broad sense, the bootstrap idea, although fascinatingand useful, is unscientific. . . Science, as we know it, requiresa language based on some unquestioned framework.Semantically, therefore, an attempt to explain all conceptscan hardly be called ‘scientific’.3It is evident that the complete ‘bootstrap’ view of nature, inwhich all phenomena in the universe are uniquely determinedby mutual self-consistency, comes very close to the Eastern"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"world view. An indivisible universe, in which all things andevents are interrelated, would hardly make sense unless itwere self-consistent. In a way, the requirement of self-con-sistency, which forms the basis of the bootstrap hypothesis,and the unity and interrelation of all phenomena, which areso strongly emphasized in Eastern mysticism, are just differentaspects of the same idea. This close connection is most clearlyexpressed in Taoism. For the Taoist sages, all phenomena inthe world were part of the cosmic Way-the Tao-and thelaws followed by the Tao were not laid down by any divinelawgiver, but were inherent in its nature. Thus we read in theTao Te Ching :Man follows the laws of earth;Earth follows the laws of heaven;Heaven follows the laws of Tao;Tao follows the laws of its intrinsic nature.4Joseph Needham, in his thorough study of Chinese scienceand civilization, discusses at great length how the Westernconcept of fundamental laws of nature, with its original im-plication of a divine lawgiver, has no counterpart in Chinesethought. ‘In the Chinese world view’, Needham writes, ‘theharmonious cooperation of all beings arose, not from the ordersof a superior authority external to themselves, but from thefact that they were all parts in a hierarchy of wholes forming acosmic pattern, and what they obeyed were the internaldictates of their own natures.‘5According to Needham, the Chinese did not even have aword corresponding to the classical Western idea of a ‘law ofnature’. The term which comes closest to it is Ii, which the Neo-Confucian philosopher Chu Hsi* describes as ‘the innumerablevein-like patterns included in the Tao’.6 Needham translateslias’principleoforganisation’andgivesthefollowingcomments:In its most ancient meaning, it signified the pattern inthings, the markings of jade or fibres in muscle . . . Itacquired the common dictionary meaning ‘principle’,but always conserved the undertone of ‘pattern’ . . .

The following passage by Ch’en Shun, an immediatepupil of Chu Hsi who lived around A.D. 1200, gives a veryclear account of this idea in words which could be taken asa perfect explanation of the notion of self-consistency in thebootstrap philosophy:Li is a natural and unescapable law of affairs and things . . .The meaning of ‘natural and unescapable’ is that (human)affairs and (natural) things are made just exactly to fit intoplace. The meaning of ‘law’ is that the fitting into placeoccurs without the slightest excess or deficiency . . . Themen of old, investigating things to the utmost, and searchingout Ii, wanted to elucidate the natural unescapablenessof (human) affairs and (natural) things, and this simplymeans that what they were looking for was all the exactplaces where things precisely fit together. Just that.8In the Eastern view then, as in the view of modern physics,everything in the universe is connected to everything else andno part of it is fundamental. The properties of any part aredetermined, not by some fundamental law, but by the propertiesof all the other parts. Both physicists and mystics realize theresulting impossibility of fully explaining any phenomenon, butthen they take different attitudes. Physicists, as discussed before,are satisfied with an approximate understanding of nature. TheEastern mystics, on the other hand, are not interested inapproximate, or ‘relative’ knowledge. They are concerned with‘absolute’ knowledge involving an understanding of the totalityof Life. Being well aware of the essential interrelationship of theuniverse, they realize that to explain something means, ulti-mately, to show how it is connected to everything else. As thisis impossible, the Eastern mystics insist that no single pheno-menon can be explained. Thus Ashvaghosha:"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"All things in their fundamental nature are not namableor explicable. They cannot be adequately expresssed inany form of language.gThe Eastern sages, therefore, are generally not interested inexplaining things, but rather in obtaining a direct non-intellectualexperience of the unity of all things. This was the attitude ofthe Buddha who answered all questions about life’s meaning,the origin of the world, or the nature of nirvana, with a ‘noblesilence’. The nonsensical answers of Zen masters, when askedto explain something, seem to have the same purpose; to makethe student realize that everything is a consequence of all therest; that ‘explaining’ nature just means to show its unity;that, ultimately, there is nothing to explain. When a monkasked Tozan, who was weighing some flax, What is Buddha?Tozan said, This flax weighs three pounds’;lO and when Joshuwas asked why Bodhidharma came to China, he replied, ‘Anoak tree in the garden.‘”To free the human mind from words and explanations is oneof the main aims of Eastern mysticism. Both Buddhists andTaoists speak of a ‘network of words’, or a ‘net of concepts’,thus extending the idea of the interconnected web to therealm of the intellect. As long as we try to explain things, weare bound by karma: trapped in our conceptual network. Totranscend words and explanations means to break the bondsof karma and attain liberation.The world view of the Eastern mystics shares with the bootstrapphilosophy of modern physics not only an emphasis on themutual interrelation and self-consistency of all phenomena,but also the denial of fundamental constituents of matter. In auniverse which is an inseparable whole and where all formsare fluid and ever-changing, there is no room for any fixedfundamental entity. The notion of ‘basic building blocks’ ofmatter is therefore generally not encountered in Easternthought. Atomic theories of matter have never been developedin Chinese thought, and although they have arisen in someschools of Indian philosophy, they are rather peripheral toIndian mysticism.

In that sense, one mightsay that every part ‘contains’ all the others and, indeed, avision of mutual embodiment seems to be characteristic ofthe mystical experience of nature. In the words of Sri Aurobindo,Nothing to the supramental sense is really finite; it isfounded on a feeling of all in each and of each in all.‘3This notion of ‘all in each and each in all’ has found its mostextensive elaboration in the Avatamsaka school of MahayanaBuddhism* which is often considered to be the final culminationof Buddhist thought. It is based on the Avatamsaka Sutra,traditionally believed to have been delivered by the Buddhawhile he was in deep meditation after his Awakening. Thisvoluminous sutra, which has so far not been translated intoany Western language, describes in great detail how the worldis perceived in the enlightened state of consciousness, when‘the solid outlines of individuality melt away and the feelingof finiteness no longer oppresses us.‘14 In its last part, calledthe Candavyuha, it tells the story of a young pilgrim, Sudhana,and gives the most vivid account of his mystical experience ofthe universe, which appears to him as a perfect network ofmutual relations, where all things and events interact witheach other in such a way that each of them contains, in itself,*See p. 98."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"all the others. The following passage from the sum, paraphrasedby D. T. Suzuki, uses the image of a magnificently decoratedtower to convey Sudhana’s experience:The Tower is as wide and spacious as the sky itself.

And all thesetowers, beyond calculation in number, stand not at all inone another’s way; each preserves its individual existencein perfect harmony with all the rest; there is nothing herethat bars one tower being fused with all the others in-dividually and collectively; there is a state of perfectintermingling and yet of perfect orderliness. Sudhana,the young pilgrim, sees himself in all the towers as well asin each single tower, where all is contained in one andeach contains all.15The Tower in this passage is, of course, a metaphor for theuniverse itself, and the perfect mutual interfusion of its partsis known in Mahayana Buddhism as ‘interpenetration’. TheAvatamsaka makes it clear that this interpenetration is anessentially dynamic interrelation which takes place not onlyspatially but also temporally. As mentioned previously,* spaceand time are also seen as interpenetrating.The experience of interpenetration in the state of enlighten-ment can be seen as a mystical vision of the complete ‘boot-strap’ situation, where all phenomena in the universe areharmoniously interrelated. In such a state of consciousness,the realm of the intellect is transcended and causal explanationsbecome unnecessary, being replaced by the direct experienceof the mutual interdependence of all things and events. TheBuddhist concept of interpenetration thus goes far beyond any*See p.172293Inter-penetration"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"294scientific bootstrap theory. Nevertheless, there are models ofThesubatomic particles in modern physics, based on the bootstrapTao ofhypothesis, which show the most striking parallels to the viewsPhysicsof Mahayana Buddhism.When the bootstrap idea is formulated in a scientific context,it has to be limited and approximate, and its main approximationconsists in neglecting all but the strong interactions. Since theseinteraction forces are about a hundred times stronger thanthe electromagnetic ones, and many more orders of magnitudestronger than weak and gravitational interactions, such anapproximation seems reasonable. The scientific bootstrap,then, deals exclusively with strongly interacting particles, orhadrons, and is therefore often called the ‘hadron bootstrap’.It is formulated in the framework of S-matrix theory and itsaim is to derive all properties of hadrons and their interactionsuniquely from the requirement of self-consistency. The only‘fundamental laws’ accepted are the general S-matrix principlesdiscussed in the previous chapter, which are required by ourmethods of observation and measurement and thus constitutethe unquestioned framework necessary for all science. Otherproperties of the S matrix may have to be postulated temporarilyas ‘fundamental principles’, but will be expected to emerge asa necessary consequence of self-consistency in the completetheory. The postulate that all hadrons form sequences describedby the Regge formalism* may he of that kind.In the language of S-matrix theory, then, the bootstraphypothesis suggests that the full S matrix, and thus all theproperties of hadrons, can be determined uniquely from thegeneral principles because there is only one possible S matrixconsistent with all three of them. This conjecture receivessupport from the fact that physicists have never come closeto constructing a mathematical model which satisfies thethree general principles. If the only consistent S matrix is theone describing a// properties and interactions of hadrons, asthe bootstrap hypothesis assumes, the physicists’ failure toconstruct a-consistent partial S matrix becomes understandable.The phenomena involving hadrons are so complex that it is‘See Q. 274._.."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"by no means certain whether the complete self-consistent Smatrix will ever be constructed, but one can envisage a seriesof partially successful models of smaller scope. Each of themwould be intended to cover only a part of hadron physics andwould therefore contain some unexplained parameters repre-senting its limitations, but the parameters of one model maybe explained by another. Thus more and more hadron pheno-mena may gradually be covered with ever-increasing accuracyby a mosaic of interlocking models whose net number ofunexplained parameters will keep decreasing. The adjective‘bootstrap’ is thus never appropriate for any individual model,but can only be applied to a combination of mutually consistentmodels, none of which is any more fundamental than theothers. As Chew has put it, ‘A physicist who is able to view anynumber of different partially successful models withoutfavoritism is automatically a bootstrapper.’A number of partial models of that kind already exist,formulated in S-matrix language and describing certain aspectsof hadron phenomena. The most successful of them are theso-called ‘dual models’ which make extensive use of the dualdescription of hadron reactions in terms of direct and crosschannels.* These models incorporate, for the first time, two ofthe three general principles** plus the crossing property of theS matrix and the Regge formalism. They constitute so far themost promising attempts at carrying out the bootstrapprogramme.The picture of hadrons which emerges from these bootstrapmodels is often summed up in the provocative phrase, ‘everyparticle consists of all other particles’. It must not be imagined,however, that each hadron contains all the others in a classical,static sense. Rather than ‘containing’ one another, hadrons‘involve’ one another in the dynamic and probabilistic senseof S-matrix theory, each hadron being a potential ‘bound state’of all sets of particles which may interact with one anotherto form the hadron under consideration.*** In that sense, allhadrons are composite structures whose components are*See p. 272.**They do not satisfy the so-called ‘unitarity principle’; see p. 274.***seep. 266.295Inter-penetration"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"2%again hadrons, and none of them is any more elementary thanThethe others. The binding forces holding the structures togetherTao ofmanifest themselves through the exchange of particles, andPhysicsthese exchanged particles are again hadrons. Each hadron,therefore, plays three roles: it is a composite structure, it maybe a constituent of another hadron, and it may be exchangedbetween constituents and thus constitute part of the forcesholding a structure together. The concept of ‘crossing’ is crucialfor this picture. Each hadron is held together by forces associatedwith the exchange of other hadrons in the cross channel, eachof which is, in turn, held together by forces to which the firsthadron makes a contribution. Thus, ‘each particle helps togenerate other particles, which in turn generate it.“’ The wholeset of hadrons generates itself in this way or pulls itself up, so tosay, by its ‘bootstraps’. The idea, then, is that this extremelycomplex bootstrap mechanism is self-determining, that is, thatthere is only one way in which it can be achieved. In otherwords, there is only one possible self-consistent set of hadrons-the one found in nature.In the hadron bootstrap, all particles are dynamically composedof one another in a self-consistent way, and in that sense canbe said to ‘contain’ one another. In Mahayana Buddhism, avery similar notion is applied to the whole universe. This cosmicnetwork of interpenetrating things and events is illustrated inthe Avatamsaka Sutra by the metaphor of Indra’s net, a vastnetwork of precious gems hanging over the palace of the godIndra. In the words of Sir Charles Eliot:In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network ofpearls, so arranged that if you look at one you see all theothers reflected in it. In the same way each object in theworld is not merely itself but involves every other objectand in fact is everything else. ‘In every particle of dust,there are present Buddhas without number.‘18The similarity of this image with that of the hadron bootstrapis indeed striking. The metaphor of Indra’s net may justly becalled the first bootstrap model, created by the Eastern sagessome 2,500 years before the beginning of particle physics.-.. _ - -"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Buddhists insist that the concept of interpenetration is notcomprehensible intellectually, but is to be experienced by anenlightened mind in the state of meditation. Thus D. T. Suzukiwrites :The Buddha [in the Gandavyuhal is no more the one whois living in the world conceivable in space and time. Hisconsciousness is not that of an ordinary mind which mustbe regulated according to the senses and logic . . . TheBuddha of the Gandavyuha lives in a spiritual world which ’has its own rules.19In modern physics, the situation is quite similar. The idea ofevery particle containing all the others is inconceivable inordinary space and time. It describes a reality which, like theone of the Buddha, has its own rules. In the case of the hadronbootstrap, they are the rules of quantum theory and relativitytheory, the key concept being that the forces holding particlestogether are themselves particles exchanged in the crosschannels. This concept can be given a precise mathematicalmeaning, but is almost impossible to visualize. It is a specificallyrelativistic feature of the bootstrap, and since we have nodirect experience of the four-dimensional world of space-time,it is extremely difficult to imagine how a single particle cancontain all other particles and at the same time be part ofeach of them. This, however, is exactly the view of theMahayana:When the one is set against all the others, the one is seenas pervading them all and at the same time embracingthem all in itself.”The idea of each particle containing all the others has notonly arisen in Eastern mysticism, but also in Western mysticalthought. It is implicit, for example, in William Blake’s famouslines :To see a world in a grain of sandAnd a heaven in a wild flower,Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,And eternity in an hour.297Inter-penetration"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"298Here again, a mystical vision has led to an image of the boot-Thestrap type; if the poet sees the world in a grain of sand, theTao ofmodern physicist sees the world in a hadron.PhysicsA similar image appears in the philosophy of Leibniz whoconsidered the world as being made of fundamental substancescalled ‘monads’, each of which mirrored the whole universe.This led him to a view of matter which shows similarities tothat of Mahayana Buddhism and to the hadron bootstrap.*In his Monadology, Leibniz writes :Each portion of matter may be conceived of as a gardenfull of plants, and as a pond full of fishes. But each branchof the plant, each member of the animal, each drop of its-humors, is also such a garden or such a pond.21It is interesting that the similarity of these lines to thepassages of the Avatamsaka Sutra mentioned before may stemfrom an actual Buddhist influence on Leibniz. Joseph Needhamhas argued22 that Leibniz was well acquainted with Chinesethought and culture through translations he received fromJesuit monks, and that his philosophy might very well havebeen inspired by the Neo-Confucian school of Chu Hsi withwhich he was familiar. This school, however, has one of itsroots in Mahayana Buddhism, and in particular in the Avatamsaka(Chinese: ha-yen) school of the Mahayana branch. Needham,in fact, mentions the parable of Indra’s net of pearls explicitlyin connection with the Leibnizian monads.A more detailed comparison of Leibniz’ notion of ‘mirroringrelations’ between monads with the idea of interpenetration inthe Mahayana seems to show,. however, that the two arerather different, and that the Buddhist conception of mattercomes much closer to the spirit of modern physics than thatof Leibniz. The principal difference between the Monadologyand the Buddhist view seems to be that the Leibnizian monadsare fundamental substances which are seen as the ultimateconstituents of matter. Leibniz begins the Monadology withthe words, The monad of which we shall here speak is merely*The parallels between Leibniz’ view of matter and the hadron bootstrap haverecently been discussed; see C. Gale, ‘Chew’s Monadology’, journal of Historyof Ideas, vol. 35 (April-June 1974), pp. 339-48."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple,that is to say, without parts.’ He goes on to say, ‘And thesemonads are the true atoms of nature, and, in a word, theelements of all things.‘23Such a ‘fundamentalist’ view is instriking contrast to the bootstrap philosophy, and is also totallydifferent from the view of Mahayana Buddhism which rejectsall fundamental entities or substances. Leibniz’ fundamentalistway of thinking is also reflected in his view of forces which heregards as laws ‘imprinted by divine decree’ and essentiallydifferent from matter. ‘Forces and activity’, he writes, ‘cannotbe states of a merely passive thing like matter.‘” Again, thisis contrary to the views of modern physics and of Easternmysticism.As far as the actual interrelation between the monads isconcerned, the main difference to the hadron bootstrap seemsto be that monads do not interact with each other; they ‘haveno windows’, as Leibniz says, and merely mirror one another.In the hadron bootstrap, on the other hand, as in the Mahayana,the emphasis is on the interaction, or ‘interpenetration’, of allparticles. Furthermore, the bootstrap and the Mahayana viewsof matter are both ‘space-time’ views which see objects asevents whose mutual interpenetration can only be understoodif one realizes that space and time, too, are interpenetrating.The bootstrap hypothesis is not yet firmly established and thetechnical difficulties involved in its implementation are con-siderable. Nevertheless, physicists already speculate aboutextending the self-consistent approach beyond the descriptionof hadrons. In the present context of S-matrix theory, such anextension is not possible. The framework of the S matrix hasbeen developed specifically to describe the strong interactionsand cannot beapplied to the rest of particle physics, the principalreason being that it cannot accommodate the massless particleswhich are characteristic of all the other interactions. To enlargethe hadron bootstrap, therefore, a more general frameworkwill have to be found, and in this new framework some of theconcepts which are at present accepted without explanationwill have to be ‘bootstrapped’; they will have to be derived,that is, from the overall self-consistency. According to GeoffreyChew, these might include our conception of macroscopic299Inter-penetrationI"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"300space-time and, perhaps, even that of human consciousness:TheTao ofCarried to its logical extreme, the bootstrap conjecturePhysicsimplies that the existence of consciousness, along withall other aspects of nature, is necessary for self-consistencyof the whole.25This view, again, is in perfect harmony with the views of theEastern mystical traditions which have always regarded con-sciousness as an integral part of the universe. In the Easternview, human beings, like all other life forms, are parts of aninseparable organic whole. Their intelligence, therefore, impliesthat the whole, too, is intelligent. Man is seen as the livingproof of cosmic intelligence; in us, the universe repeats overand over again its ability to produce forms through which itbecomes consciously aware of itself.In modern physics, the question of consciousness has arisenin connection with the observation of atomic phenomena.Quantum theory has made it clear that these phenomenacan only be understood as links in a chain of processes, theend of which lies in the consciousness of the human observer.*In the words of Eugene Wigner, ‘It was not possible to formulatethe laws of [quantum theory1 in a fully consistent way withoutreference to consciousness.‘26The pragmatic formulation ofquantum theory used by the scientists in their work does notrefer to their consciousness explicitly. Wigner and otherphysicists have argued, however, that the explicit inclusion ofhuman consciousness may be an essential aspect of futuretheories of matter.Such a development would open exciting possibilities for adirect interaction between physics and Eastern mysticism.The understanding of one’s consciousness and of its relationto the rest of the universe is the starting point of all mysticalexperience. The Eastern mystics have explored various modesof consciousness throughout centuries, and the conclusionsthey have reached are often radically different from the ideasheld in the West. If physicists really want to include the natureof human consciousness in their realm of research, a study ofEastern ideas may well provide them with stimulating newviewpoints.*See p. 140-."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Thus the future enlargement of the hadron bootstrap, withthe ‘bootstrapping’ of space-time and of human consciousnessit may require, opens up unprecedented possibilities whichmay well go beyond the conventional framework of science:Such a future step would be immensely more profoundthan anything comprising the hadron bootstrap; wewould be obliged to confront the elusive concept ofobservation and, possibly, even that of consciousness.Our current struggle with the hadron bootstrap may thusbe only a foretaste of a completely new form of humanintellectual endeavor, one that will not only lie outside ofphysics but will not even be describable as ‘scientific’.27Where, then, does the bootstrap idea lead us?This, of course,nobody knows, but it is fascinating to speculate about itsultimate fate. One can imagine a network of future theo,riescovering an ever-increasing range of natural phenomena withever-increasing accuracy; a network which will contain fewerand fewer unexplained features, deriving more and more of itsstructure from the mutual consistency of its parts. Some day,then, a point will be reached where the only unexplainedfeatures of this network of theories will be the elements of thescientific framework. Beyond that point, the theory will nolonger be able to express its results in words, or in rationalconcepts, and will thus go beyond science. Instead of a boot-strap theory of nature, it will become a bootstrap vision ofnature, transcending the realms of thought and language;leading out of science and into the world of acintya, the un-thinkable. The knowledge contained in such a vision will becomplete, but cannot be communicated in words.

The relation of this knowledgeto modern physics is but one of its many aspects and, like allthe others, it cannot be demonstrated conclusively but has tobe experienced in a direct intuitive way. What I hope to haveachieved, to some extent, therefore, is not a rigorous demonstra-tion, but rather to have given the reader an opportunity torelive, every now and then, an experience which has becomefor me a source of continuing joy and inspiration; that theprincipal theories and models of modern physics lead to aview of the world which is internally consistent and in perfectharmony with the views of Eastern mysticism.For those who have experienced this harmony, the sig-nificance of the parallels between the world views of physicistsand mystics is beyond any doubt. The interesting question,then, is not whether these parallels exist, but why; and, further-more, what their existence implies.In trying to understand the mystery of Life, man has followedmany different approaches. Among them, there are the waysof the scientist and mystic, but there are many more; the waysof poets, children, clowns, shamans, to name but a few. Theseways have resulted in different descriptions of the world, bothverbal and non-verbal, which emphasize different aspects.All are valid and useful in the context in which they arose. Allof them, however, are only descriptions, or representations, ofreality and are therefore limited.

It is inadequate, however,for the description of physical phenomena in the submicro-scopic realm. Opposed to the mechanistic conception of theworld is the view of the mystics which may be epitomized bythe word ‘organic’, as it regards all phenomena in the universeas integral parts of an inseparable harmonious whole. Thisworld view emerges in the mystical traditions from meditativestates of consciousness. In their description of the world, themystics use concepts which are derived from these non-ordinary experiences and are, in general, inappropriate for ascientific description of macroscopic phenomena. The organicworld view is not advantageous for constructing machines,nor for coping with the technical problems in an overpopulatedworld.In everyday life, then, both the mechanistic and the organicviews of the universe are valid and useful; the one for scienceand technology, the other for a balanced and fulfilled spirituallife. Beyond the dimensions of our everyday environment,however, the mechanistic concepts lose their validity and haveto be replaced by organic concepts which are very similar tothose used by the mystics. This is the essential experience ofmodern physics which has been the subject of our discussion.Physics in the twentieth century has shown that the conceptsof the organic world view, although of little value for scienceand technology on the human scale, become extremely usefulat the atomic and subatomic level. The organic view, therefore,seems to be more fundamental than the mechanistic. Classicalphysics, which is based on the latter, can be derived fromquantum theory, which implies the former, whereas the reverseis not possible. This seems to give a first indication why wemight expect the world views of modern physics and Easternmysticism to be similar. Both emerge when man enquires intothe essential nature of things-into the deeper realms of matterin physics; into the deeper realms of consciousness in mysticism-when he discovers a different reality behind the superficialmechanistic appearance of everyday life.cThe parallels between the views of physicists and mystics--_ ___..._ . ._"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"become even more plausible when we recall the other similaritieswhich exist in spite of their different approaches. To begin with,their method is thoroughly empirical. Physicists derive theirknowledge from experiments; mystics from meditative insights.Both are observations, and in both fields these observationsare acknowledged as the only source of knowledge. The objectof observation is of course very different in the two cases. Themystic looks within and explores his or her consciousness atits various levels, which include the body as the physicalmanifestation of the mind. The experience of one’s body is,in fact, emphasized in many Eastern traditions and is often seenas the key to the mystical experience of the world. When weare healthy, we do not feel any separate parts in our body butare aware of it as an integrated whole, and this awarenessgenerates a feeling of well-being and happiness. In a similarway, the mystic is aware of the wholeness of the entire cosmoswhich is experienced as an extension of the body. In the wordsof Lama Covinda,To the enlightened man . . .whose consciousness embracesthe universe, to him the universe becomes his ‘body’,while his physical body becomes a manifestation of theUniversal Mind, his inner vision an expression of the highestreality, and his speech an expression of eternal truth andmantric power.’In contrast to the mystic, the physicist begins his enquiryinto the essential nature of things by studying the materialworld. Penetrating into ever deeper realms of matter, he hasbecome aware of the essential unity of all things and events.More than that, he has also learnt that he himself and hisconsciousness are an integral part of this unity. Thus the mysticand the physicist arrive at the same conclusion; one startingfrom the inner realm, the other from the outer world. Theharmony between their views confirms the ancient Indianwisdom that Brahman, the ultimate reality without, is identicalto Atman, the reality within.A further similarity between the ways of the physicist andmystic is the fact that their observations take place in realmswhich are inaccessible to the ordinary senses. In modern physics,305Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"306these are the realms of the atomic and subatomic world; inThemysticism they are non-ordinary states of consciousness inTao ofwhich the sense world is transcended. Mystics often talk aboutPhysicsexperiencing higher dimensions in which impressions ofdifferent centres of consciousness are integrated into aharmonious whole. A similar situation exists in modern physicswhere a four-dimensional ‘space-time’ formalism has beendeveloped which unifies concepts and observations belongingto different categories in the ordinary three-dimensional world.In both fields, the multi-dimensional experiences transcend thesensory world and are therefore almost impossible to expressin ordinary language.We see that the ways of the modern physicist and theEastern mystic, which seem at first totally unrelated, have, infact, much in common. It should not be too surprising, there-fore, that there are striking parallels in their descriptions of theworld. Once these parallels between Western science andEastern mysticism are accepted, a number of questions willarise concerning their implications. Is modern science, with allits sophisticated machinery, merely rediscovering ancientwisdom, known to the Eastern sages for thousands of years?Should physicists, therefore, abandon the scientific methodand begin to meditate? Or can there be a mutual influencebetween science and mysticism; perhaps even a synthesis?I think all these questions have to be answered in thenegative. I see science and mysticism as two complementarymanifestations of the human mind; of its rational and intuitivefaculties. The modern physicist experiences the world throughan extreme specialization of the rational mind; the mysticthrough an extreme specialization of the intuitive mind. Thetwo approaches are entirely different and involve far more thana certain view of the physical world. However, they are com-plementary, as we have learned to say in physics. Neither iscomprehended in the other, nor can either of them be reducedto the other, but both of them are necessary, supplementingone another for a fuller understanding of the world.

Sciencedoes not need mysticism and mysticismdoes not need science; but man needs both.

What we need, there-,fore, is not a synthesis but a dynamic interplay betweenmystical intuition and scientific analysis.So far, this has not been achieved in our society. At present,our attitude is too yang-to use again Chinese phraseology-too rational, male and aggressive. Scientists themselves are atypical example. Although their theories are leading to a worldview which is similar to that of the mystics, it is striking howlittlethis hasaffected theattitudesof most scientists. In mysticism,knowledge cannot be separated from a certain way of lifewhich becomes its living manifestation. To acquire mysticalknowledge means to undergo a transformation; one couldeven say that the knowledge is the transformation. Scientificknowledge, on the other hand, can often stay abstract andtheoretical. Thus most of today’s physicists do not seem torealize the philosophical, cultural and spiritual implications oftheir theories. Many of them actively support a society whichis still based on the mechanistic, fragmented world view,without seeing that science points beyond such a view, towardsa oneness of the universe which includes not only our naturalenvironment but also our fellow human beings. I believe thatthe world view implied by modern physics is inconsistent withour present society, which does not reflect the harmoniousinterrelatedness we observe in nature. To achieve such a stateof dynamic balance, a radically different social and economicstructure will be needed: a cultural revolution in the true senseof the word. The survival of our whole civilization may dependon whether we can bring about such a change. It will depend,ultimately, on our ability to adopt some of the yin attitudes ofEastern mysticism; to experience the wholeness of nature andthe art of living with it in harmony.307Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"NOTESI THE WAY OF PHYSICSChapter 1: Modern Physics-A Path with a Heart?1 J.
