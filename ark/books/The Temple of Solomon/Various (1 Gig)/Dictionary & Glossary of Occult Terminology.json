Pneuma Asteros, Order Chief Adept & President Contents / Quick Find: INT // A // B // C // D // E // F // G // H // I // J // K // L // M // N //O // P // Q // R // S // T // U // V // W // X // Y // Z - INTRODUCTION - Welcome to the Dictionary / Glossary of terminology for the Grade of Aspirant (0=0) of the Order of The Astral Star. Within this document the reader will find most all of the terms used in the Aspirant's Course Curriculum for the 0ro Degree. When the writer was asked to assemble this dictionary for the Order, he really had no idea what was in store for him. The writer has tried to be fair to the many different traditions and religions which the terminology covers while maintaining the validity from the perspective of his own Order, and his own experiences. This list comes from his own personal journal, and from the major glossaries at the end of the required and recommended reading list for The Order of The Astral Star's own Bibliography for Aspirant. The main Glossaries used were from Donald Michael Kraig's Modern Magick: Eleven Lessons in the High Ceremonial Arts; Donald Tyson's Ritual Magic: What it is and How to do it; Denning and Phillips' The Llewellyn Practical Guide To The Development of Psychic Powers; and The Llewellyn Practical Guide To Creative Visualization. The other works of the Aspirant Bibliography were used to augment the material in these works. Additionally, the writer consulted The Webster's New World Dictionary for determining the root etymology of some entries. Why is this work so important? Aleister Crowley was said to have advised a student at one time, \"Madame, define your terms!\" In the Preface of Aleister Crowley's Magick Without Tears, Dr. Israel Regardie wrote: \"General Semantics finds its most staunch supporter in the person and writing of Aleister Crowley. There is hardly a page in this book that does not insist that the inquirer clarify her referents. Letter 28 is a splendid example of this insistence. There are pitifully few occult writers that even know what general semantics is all about.\" In Letter 28 of Crowley's Magick Without Tears, Crowley himself writes, \"...This has been put in a sort of text, because the first stumbling-block to study is that one never has any certainty as to what the author means, or thinks he means, or is trying to persuade one that he means.\" And then again, \"The fact is that very few of us"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"know what words mean; fewer still take the trouble to inquire. We calmly, we carelessly assume that our minds are identical with that of the writer, at least on that point; and then we wonder that there should be misunderstandings!\" Hence the importance of the present work. If we are to avoid misunderstandings in our teachings, we must define our basic terminology, especially for those students who are just beginning their studies. Language is not stagnant. One only has to look at the writing style of The King James version of The Bible or the writings of William Shakespeare to notice that language does indeed change over time. Words that had a particular meaning in English five hundred years ago may mean something totally different in our own era, if the word is used at all. In the modern age of advancing technology new words are being coined all of the time. The Executive Council of our own Order has determined that if we are to convey the meanings of our teachings and relate the meanings of our own experiences to our future generations, then a Dictionary/Glossary is a necessity. The beginning student must have somewhere in which to turn to assist them in learning the vast amount of terms which they encounter while reading several different works by many different authors. It is important to note that this list of terminology is by no means complete, nor would other esoteric Orders, Fraternities, or other organizations agree with the definitions that we give within these pages. This work is intended to be used by our own membership. This work is not meant to represent the quote, \"way things are,\" but rather give the beginning student a place to begin their understanding. The Order of The Astral Star is based in Christian Mysticism and High Ceremonial Magick. These are our own organizations points of reference and thus we speak from our own perspectives. For this reason, the terminology is defined within our own biases and according to our own world view. For us, we perceive the definitions as being mostly correct, though still needing some refinement and additions. The next edition of this Dictionary will be updated and revised by you the readers as well as the membership of our own Order. The student must continue to think for themselves with these regards. For this reason, we encourage all students of our curriculum to make their own addendum to this Dictionary. Compare and contrast the meanings of the various writers for yourselves. Look up the etymology of words for yourselves. Discuss your research with your own Sponsors. With this closing bit of advice, we wish all of you the best of luck in your studies and future endeavors, and continue to remain most sincerely, Yours in The Light, Frater Pneuma Asteros, (Michael W. Humphrey) Chief Adept, Imperator, & President, Order of The Astral Star, Inc.
