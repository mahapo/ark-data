For nine nights the great god Odhinn hung on the World-Tree,pierced by his own spear, the winds between the worlds blowing cold about him. At last he saw, in a blindingmoment of might, the runes written at the great tree’s roots. He took them up: great in power, great in wisdom,growing ever in might and lore from the secret his sacrifice won him. He taught the mysteries of the runes to hischildren among the human race, and these songs of might were sung and carved on wood and stone from Ger- manyto England, to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland, wherever the Teutonic peoples walked in their bright pathsof battle and hidden wisdom.Though stilled by the kristjan church for a time, the secrets of magic lived on, passing in whispers through the ties oflove and blood. Only in this last century, by the work of a few hid- den heroes, has this wisdom been recovered.Now, in this book, it is set out as fully as possible for those who dare. Learn how to use the ancient runic magic of Odhinn: how to read the future written in the runes, how to write andchant the songs of power so that you yourself may shape the windings of your life. Learn the secrets of magicalpoetry, of ritual, of the Teu- tonic herbs and trees of enchantment, of the Nine Worlds and the ways between them,and of faring forth in the spirit to learn things hidden and work your will. Learn of the gods and wights known byour ancestors, whose might will aid you in your magic and your life: Odhinn, Thorr, Freyja, Freyr, Tyr; the elvesand dwarves; the spirits of your family and those who follow you. Take back the might of your ancestors, that youmay grow in strength and wisdom and aid in the knowledge and healing of the earth.AcknowledgementsTeutonicMagic is dedicated to the members of my first rune class, Erik (Eirikr) Malmstrom, Larry Pettit(Asgar), and Judith Pruett, who listened to this book in its first lifetime as a collection of scribbled notesand found it worthy of continued existence.I would like to thank Edred Thorsson for his kind permission to use his translations of the Rune Poems inthis book and for his encouragement and assistance in bringing it into being.

One thinks of the Germans as Teutonic; butso, too, are the descendants of the Vikings, the Anglo-Saxons, and even the Normans. If any of yourancestors came from Northern Europe, you yourself are probably heir to the old thoughts and ways of theTeutonic people, long forgotten though these may have been in the rushing modern world. If not, you arestill part of the culture they helped to shape, a speaker of a language that grew out of the world-view ofthe Anglo-Saxons for the sake of tellingwhat they held true and understood. The ways and works of ourTeutonic heritage lie just below the surface of the world we know, like gold forgotten beneath the grasscovering a mound. It is up to those whose blood and souls ring with the old songs, who feel the secretmight of the runes and hear the whispering of our ancient gods, to bring this treasure forth into the light ofday again. The working of the magic and worshipping the gods of our ancestors are two of the mostimportant first steps in requickening our hidden roots: only by matchingwisdom and works can aught ofworth be achieved. But towork the magic rightly, you must first know more of the minds from which itcame and the world giving birth to its might. This book Contains both a practical guide to the working ofTeutonic magic and some clarification of ways of thought which the modern world has largely forgotten,but which the mage who wills to reclaim the ancient might of our Teutonic ancestors must learn again.THOUGHT AND CULTURE RECLAIMED: AN INTRODUCTIONIn the life of the person who follows the old ways of the Teutonic people, there should be nothing unholy,no time at which you shut yourself off from an awareness of the workings of your soul simply because thething you are doing is not openly magical or religious in its goal. Rather, you should be aware of thepresence of the gods in everything. When you weed your garden or plant a window box, think of the bodyof Nerthus, Mother Earth, in which you dig; when you eat a hamburger, give thanks to Freyr and Freyjafor their bounty which fattened the cattle and ripened the grain for the bun! The more fully you can knowhow the gifts the gods have aided you in every aspect of your life, the closer you will be to them as youuse these gifts. The same holds true for meditating on the runes: as you think on the workings of theirvarious powers in every aspect of your life, you will become more and more adept-not only at reading thestaves, but at using them in ways which work more directly upon the part of the world you can see.Closely related to the duality of holy/unholy is the question of good and evil. The West has inherited agreat deal of its own viewpoint on this matter from the Middle East, in which it is a frequent practice toseparate being into absolute Good and absolute Evil. The problem with this, of course, is that whenabsolute concepts are applied to the relative world, they are generally applied according to localprejudices. The effectofthis can be seen in, among other things, the incredible psychological devastationwreaked on the Western world by the declaration: “Sexuality is evil; absence of sexuality is good.”The first, and most important, re-turning of thought back to the ancient ways comes in dealingwith the duality ofsacredandprofaneas seen by the modern world. The terms themselves come fromLatin roots; rooted in Anglo-Saxon, the words become “holy” and “unholy,” having very differentmeanings and connotations.Holycomes from a root meaning “healthy, whole,” showing that in theGermanic mind something holy is not cut off from the physical world, but rather is strong in both theearth and the worlds of the soul which are woven into it. Something unholy is not simply mundane or“non-spiritual” in the way that a profane thing is; it is something sick or flawed. To hallow a place or itemis not to set it apart from the world- it is not taboo or untouchable in the sense of the Judeo-kristjan (Norsespelling of Christian) “sacred”-rather, it is filled with such a power of holiness as to ward it from anyunholy-warped or woe-working-wights.Rather than this extreme and absolutist view of good and evil, the Teutonic peoples viewed rightas being that justice and correctness which maintains a living society, while wrong was injustice,incorrectness, or anything breaking the bonds of fairness and law on which society is founded. This4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Teutonic belief in right as justice and fairness is one of the foremost Germanic contributions tocivilization as a whole, especially when you see it as the main barrier against Western civilization’sadvance into totalitarianism: the deep-rooted belief that “no one is above the law,” that neither privatepeople nor the government has the right to step outside the bounds of the legal system for any purposeand even a king or a president can be brought before the courts if due cause exists.Related to the question of right and wrong is the dichotomy of weal-working and woe-working.In cases of magical action, where lawful justice is more difficult to determine, these are the aspects whichmust be considered. Simply stated, weal is that which works towards your welfare and the welfare ofothers; woe is that which harms yourself and/or others. From this standpoint, there is no excuse forcrusading under the banner of “my enemy is evil and lam good”; instead, you must honestly be able tosay, in a case where you are forced to take action against another, “he/she is causing harm to others andmust be stopped; I am willingly causing woe in hopes that a worse woe may be averted, and I know that Imaybe working my own doom as well.” With further study, you will notice that there is nothingintrinsically evil in the Germanic legends; only creatures which cause harm and must therefore be slain orbanished. However, the giant kindreds are capable of working weal as well as woe; the gods work woe aswell as weal; and in the sagas and legends we see that the most innocent of acts performed withoutforethought may lead to either result.The nature of runic magic’s effectiveness is such that it should always be handled with thegreatest of care lest you should unwittingly write the doom of yourself or of others, or write woe whereyou had meant weal; this will be dealt with more fully later. It should also be remembered that thecommon weal is more important than your personal good.Figure 1: The Horizontal World-PatternFigure 2: The Vertical World-Pattern5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SECTION I: THE TEUTONIC WORLD1: THE NINE WORLDS OF YGGDRASILThe Nine Worlds of the Teutonic cosmos are arranged in two major patterns: the horizontal and thevertical (see figs. I and 2). The two are not complementary: the vertical model represents a refinement ofthe horizontal, which shows the traditional levels of being-the Overworld, the Earth, and the Underworld-passed through in the spiritual journey.The most significant aspect of the horizontal world-pattern is its emphasis on boundaries: theocean which separates the world of humans from the worlds surrounding it the second fence protectingMidgardhr (lit. “middle enclosure”) from the foes without and the inner circle of Asgardhr (“enclosure ofthe gods”). The basic idea is shown in the practice of putting up a fence around the farmsteadGardhr)which divides theinnangardhs(the social space within) from the uncontrolled, unknown, and hencedangerousutangardhs(the wild space without). [1] The termUtgardhrrefers to the entire area outside theocean surrounding Midgardhr, in which a number of uncanny and often woe-working beings dwell. Theocean itself represents the spiritual plane which is the boundary between worlds. It is, however, notablethat in the legends one can fly, ride, or walk to these worlds. Your precise vision of this plane will varyaccording to your personal awareness, but the root idea of the journey will not.The horizontal world-view shows the location and arrangement of the “elemental worlds,” whichare considered to be on the same level as Midgardhr in the sense that beings from any one of these worldscan cross into another without a great deal of spiritual preparation. Alfheimr and Svartalfheim do notappear on this map at all because they share the central space with Midgardhr, Asgardhr and Hel; they areconsidered respectively to occupy the upper and lower realms of Midgardhr itself. To view the verticaldiagram (fig. 2) correctly, the elemental world Niflheimr, Jotunheimr, Muspellheimr, and Vanaheimr-should still be pictured as horizontally arranged, with the Asgardhr/Hel axis passing through the center ofMidgardhr at right angles to the flat plane. This diagram shows the pattern contained in the treeYggdrasill, which defines the organic structure maintaining the shape of the cosmos and holding theworlds in the proper relationship to each other, manifesting the shape of being concealed in the well at itsfoot. The worlds are connected by the multiple “roots” and “branches” of this tree; these are the roadswhich may be travelled between them and the channels through which the forces of each world pass tointeract with the others.ASGARDHRThe highest of the Nine Worlds is called Asgardhr, “enclosure of the gods.” In theProse Edda,SnorriSturluson describes this innergardh(enclosure) as being built in the center of Midgardhr, the hallowedspace within the enclosure of human society. Asgardhr’s place above the horizontal plane shows itsseparation from the elemental worlds; it requires either the aid of thevalkyrjain crossing the bridgeBifrost or exceptional strength of purpose and will to reach Asgardhr by any other means. Bifrost iscomposed of air, water, and fire, burning with a purifying flame. It is warded by the god Heimdallr, thepersonification of the hallowed air/water/fire triad and father of the kin-bindings between gods andhumans. The crossing of this bridge is only for the initiated; its fire guards Asgardhr against thethurses,and neither the warriors who come to Valhalla nor Thorr, least spiritually refined of the Aesir, can crossit, but must instead force their way through the rivers surrounding Asgardhr. Thund roars and fish live in the flood of Thiothvitnir. That river’s current seems too strong for the throng of the slaughtered to wade... 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Kormt and Ormt, and the two Kerlaugs, these Thor shall wade each day when he fares to doom at the ash Yggdrasil. The bridge of the Gods is all ablaze with fire and the holy waters seethe. [2]The river Thund (“the noisy”) represents the passage through water of death. Only the strongest of soulcan force theirway upward to Valhalla; the rest sink to the still realms of Hel while strength anddetermination are enough for the warrior, it is the goal of thevitkito gain the valkyrja’s aid and be able tocross over BifrostWithin Asgardhr are the halls belonging to the various gods, described in detail in Grimnismal. Aknowledge of these dwellings is good both for the clues they provide to the nature of the gods and forinvocational precision. These halls areThrudheimr,the dwelling of Thorr, Ydal (Yew-dale) plains forUllr,Valaskjalffor Odhinn,Sokkvabekkfor Saga (possibly a hypostasis of Frigg) and Odhinn,Glad-homewhere Valhalla is built,Thrymheimrfor Skadhi,Breidhablikfor Baldr,Himinbjorgfor Heimdallr,Folkvangrwhere Freyja keeps her half of the battle-slain,Glitnirfor ForsettNoatunfor Niord, andVithi,where Vidar dwells. It has also been suggested that each of the twelve halls represents a different sign ofthe Zodiac/month of the year, beginning with Thrudheim as Capricorn, since the Teutonic year starts onMother-night (Dec. 20-21). Colors associated with Asgardhr are gold, silver and white.ALFHEIMRAlfheimr is the dwelling of the Light Alfar. It is close to Asgardhr, being listed among the halls of thegods (though not numbered among the twelve). A frequent refrain in Eddic poetry is “How fare theAesir? How fare the alfs?”[3] Alfheimr is ruled by Freyr and characterized by the higher aspects of lightand air. Alfheimr is the realm through which the flows of energy from Asgardhr are often transmitted toMidgardhr. In this world, the highest energies of the realm of humans mingle with the lower energies ofthe realm of the gods. It is the highest realm which can be reached from Midgardhr without the necessityof makinga crossing. The colors associated with Alfheimr are yellow, light blue, light green, and white.SVARTALFHEIMAs Alfheimr, the dwelling of the Light Alfar, overlaps the highest reaches of Midgardhr, so Svartalfheim,the dwelling of the Black Alfar, interpenetrates the subterranean regions of the earth. In this realm arefound the mysteries of earthly manifestation, represented by the matchless smith craft of the dwarves.Svartalfheim contains the lowest frequencies of Midgardhr and the highest of Hel, standing in much thesame relationship to Hel that Alfheimr does to Asgardhr. This realm can be reached with ease fromMidgardhr, often inadvertently, as described in a number of tales. The colors of Svartalfheim are darkbrown, gray, and red-gold.HELThe lowest of the Nine Worlds is Hel, ruled by the goddess Hel, mistress of the chthonic mysteries. AsAsgardhr is at the crown of Yggdrasill, Hel is at its base. Like Asgardhr, Hel cannot be reached directlyfrom Midgardhr one must “ride over a bridge,” or travel between worlds with the aid of one’sfylgja.Thebridge to Hel crosses the river Gjoll and is guarded by the giant maiden Modgudh. As Bifrost is fiery andnarrow, the bridge to Hel is icy and wide.Hel is also called Nifelhel, meaning “Misty Hel” or “Dark Hel,” which refers to the goddess’primary aspect of concealment. Hel borders very closely on the world Niflheimr; it is located “down andto the north,” and it is the implied location of the venom-filled halls on Na Strand and home of the dragonNiddhogg, embodiment of the concealed powers of destruction/transformation within Hvergelmir, theoriginal source of which was Niflheimr! Hel is the hidden root to which all things sink, as all the waterswend their way to Hvergelmir, and from which all things rise again.Although the realm of Hel is described as horrible in part the lifeless, lightless, joyless dwellingof the dead-it is written elsewhere that Hel is brightly bedecked to welcome Balder after his death. This7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"dual nature can be seen in the figure of the goddess Hel herself; she is half a beautiful woman and half acorpse, her concealment both that of the womb and that of the tomb. Hel receives those souls who cannotstruggle through to Valhalla, but in time, as her name “Mother Holle” suggests, she bears them forthagain. The colors of Hel are black, dark green, and dark brown.JOTUNHEIMRThe most characteristic world of the utangardhs is Jotunheimr. This land is the dwelling of thethursar,rises,andetins(various types of giant; see chapter 19, Outdwellers), the children of Ymir. It is frosty androcky, lashed by violent winds and storms. Jotunheimr is located in the east, the direction (roughly) fromwhich the Teutonic peoples have migrated; the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem describes the ancestor-hero Ingfaring forth from the east. Jotunheimr is the land of primeval ancestry; Thorsson mentions that “to go intothe east” is a term used to describe the act of faring into the realm of preconscious forces.[4] It isinhabited by beings of great wisdom such as the etin Vafthrudhnir, from whom even Odhinn can learn, bythe giants and by the semi-sapient hrimthursar or ice-giants who continually seek to break and destroy thewalls of the ordered world. It is these beings specifically against whom Midgardhr has been walled offand against whom Thor wards us; they characterize one aspect of the foes dwelling outside the gardh.Jotunheimr is the turbulent world of elemental air which, through its endless seething andstruggling, both breaks down and fertilizes. Its nature is seen in the shattering, icy might of the wind fromthe east. The colors of Jotunheimr are red and gray.VANAHEIMRJotunheimr is balanced by Vanaheimr, which is characterized by peace and plenty. The Vanir are gods offertility, riches, and joy. Vanaheimr represents the world of water, its nature being shown by the life-bringing and gentle winds from the west. As well as ruling over fertility, the Vanir are also described as“the wise Vanir”[5] and are noted for their powers of foresight.Seidh-magicis the power used and taughtby the Vanic Freyja. It is characterized by the journeying of the spirit and the power of prophecy. Whilethe Vanir are not without their warlike aspects, they are not generally considered gods of war but ofpeace, prosperity, and harvest. The Vanir are also gods of death, and Vanaheimr, the watery world of thewest may be associated with the “final far-faring,” the ship-voyage of death. The colors of Vanaheimr aredark green, dark blue, brown, and red-gold.NIFLHEIMR; MUSPELLHEIMRNiflheimr and Muspellheimr, the worlds of primal ice and primal fire, are set respectively in the northernand southern parts of the utangardhs, through which their mights are filtered and mixed to bring about theforces working through Midgardhr. Both worlds and their inhabitants, being the pure forces of fire andice, would be endlessly destructive if released onto the worlds of the innangardhs. As the High One (anOdhinnic hypostasis) says inGylfagynning,“there is nothing in the world that can be relied upon whenthe sons of Muspell are on the warpath.” [6] Muspellheimr is ruled by Surtr, who will meet Freyr in battleat Ragnarok. The color of Niflheimr is black; the color of Muspellheimr is red.MIDGARDHRThe central world of all is this earth, Midgardhr, also known as Middle-Earth. This world brings togetherand melds the might of all the other worlds and is connected to them by the roots, branches, and trunk ofthe tree Yggdrasill. This world represents the element earth, which in Teutonic thought, as inestablishment Western magic, encompasses all of the other elements. Unlike the earth of establishmentmagic, however, the earth of the Teutonic tradition also incorporates the workings of spirit as receiveddirectly from Asgardhr by way of Bifrost and indirectly through Alfheimr.It is essential that the vitki be able to maintain her/his footing in Midgardhr and preserve themiddle world’s balance of power within him/herself; otherwise he/she runs the risk of being over- comeby the energies of a world with which she/he has worked too closely Folklore is filled with the stories ofthose who have become “captive” in other worlds; i.e., so closely attuned to the energies of those worldsthat they went mad or became otherwise unable to function in this world.8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2: URHDR’S WELL: THE WORKINGS OF WYRDPerhaps the most notable difference between modern thought-patterns and those of the ancient Germanicpeople, which relates to the most essential theory of runic working, is the concept of time and being inrelationship to time. Modern Western culture has absorbed the threefold Greco-Roman concept of time as“past” (that which has gone before), “present” (that which is), and “future” (that which will be). It is easyto associate these concepts with the three Norns Urdhr, Verdhandi, and Skuld. It is also incorrect. TheGermanic time-sense is not threefold, but twofold: time is divided into “that- which-is,” a conceptencompassing everything that has ever happened-not as a linear progression, but as a unity of interwovenlayers and “that-which-is-becoming,” the active changing of the present as it grows from the patterns setin that-which-is. That- which-is is the Germanic “world,” a word literally cognate to the Norsever-öld,“age of a man.” One will notice that even in modern English, there is no true future tense; the future canonly be formed through the use of modal auxiliaries. For the Teutonic mind, all that has been is stillimmediate and alive; the present only exists as it has been shaped by the great mass of what is, and thefuture only as the patterns of that which is becoming now should shape in turn. Without thisunderstanding of time in the Teutonic world, your power of reading and writing the runes will be at bestlimited, at worst in error and unpredictable in result.The Teutonic conception of time and being is fully expressed in one of the most ancient imagesof the Germanic peoplesthe ever-green tree with the well at its foot. This is best known as the NorseYggdrasill, described thus in the Poetic Edda: I know an ash that stands, called Yggdrasil a tall tree, wet with white dews, dews dripping down into the dales. Ever green it stands over Urth’s well. From there come three maidens, deep in lore, from the water that stands under the tree. One is called Urth, the other Verthandi, the third Skuld. Scores they carved, laws they laid, lives they chose. They worked Orlög for the sons of men. [1]The tree upholds the Nine Worlds; it is the ever-growing manifestation of that-which-is and that-which-is-becoming, rooted in and shaped by the well which defines and contains time as the tree definesand contains space. The tree represents the body of Ymir, the set form and space; the well and thenourishing, shaping waters flowing up from through the tree and back are the powers embodied, at thebeginning of all things, in the cow Audhumbla. The maidens referred to are the three Norns; their namesmean “that-which-has-become” (Urdhr), “that-which-is-becoming” (Verdhandi) and “that-which should-become” (Skuld). Urdhr is the greatest of the three, the other two being extensions of her power. Hername is cognate to the Anglo-SaxonWyrdor modern Englishweird,the root of which means “to turn”and from which several Germanic verbs meaning “to become” are derived. The word “Wyrd” has beentranslated as “fate,” but the essential concept behind it is entirely different from the Greco-Roman idea offate.In the Prose Edda, Yggdrasill is described as having three roots with a well under each:“The third stands over Niflheimr, and under that root is Hvergelmir, and Nidhoggr gnaws the tree frombelow. But under that root which turns towards the Rime-Giants is Mimir’s Well, wherein wisdom andunderstanding are stored; and he is called Mimir, who keeps the well... The third root of the Ash stands inheaven, and under that root is the well which is very holy, that is called the Well of Urdhr.” [2]9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"InThe Well And The Tree,Bauschatz suggests that this is an overspecialization, that in fact each ofthe three wells represents a certain level of the single Well of Urdhr or Wyrd. The nameHvergelmirmeans “seething kettle”; it is obviously the containment of the primal rivers(laguz)flowing fromNiflheimr at the beginning, whose names appropriately denote their seething, active nature. This is thesource of the power pushing the waters upward through the Well-the special “active” quality indicated bythe termbrunnrwhich is usually applied to this well, the “brunnr” orburnebeing a well which is builtaround an active, flowing spring rather than the standing water of an ordinary well.[3] The term impliesboth force and containment, which makes possible the accumulation of the events of becoming and hencethe maintaining of the ever-growing world of being. The creation of the world out of chaos indicates therestraint of the well around the seething waters and the binding of Audhumbla’s proto-force to make herpower an integral part of the preservation and ordered growth of the world. Hvergelmir is associated withthe gnawing of the dragon Nidhoggr, who on one level represents the venom of corrosion present alongwith the yeast of life, in the primal waters, and on another embodies the concealment integral to theunderstanding of the well of Wyrd (see Wyrm).The second level of the Well of Wyrd is the well of Mimir, whose name means “memory.” Mimiris described as “wisest of the etin-kind,” having gained his wisdom by drinking every day from this well,which is to say, by the continual internalization of the entire temporal unity of the ever-growing world Itis significant that Mimir is an etin and that the description of Mimir’s well places it in Jotunheimr, thedwelling of pre-conscious forces, when you consider the nature of this level of the well: the primevalforces welling from Hvergelmir are here filtered through the awareness of every- thing that has happenedsince the first union of fire and ice. It is in this level of the well that the intertwined layers of that-which-ismay be found and understood; students of general occultism will see a resemblance to the AkashicRecord here. Everything that has happened-all the events and patterns making up the entirety of the world(“ver-öld”) exists within Mimir’s well. This is the aspect of the Well to which one comes in order toreawaken the ancestral memories, as described in the Rite of Mimir (See Section V: Appendices).The Well of Urdhr, the “top” level, or that which most directly affects manifestation, is the aspectby which that-which-is continues to form that-which-is-becoming. The Norns are described as sprinklingwater and clay from the Well over the tree Yggdrasill for the purpose of healing and nourishing it. Thismay be seen as analogous to thelögleggja,the laying of laws which literally means “laying layers,” thelayers which form the structure of the world. The Norns alsoorlögseggja,“speak the primal layer,” whichis to say that they have the power of determining which layers of action within that- which-is shall be themightiest in shaping becoming.[4] The process of becoming is a process of accretion; the patterns of thelayers below determine the pattern in which the layers now being laid shall fall and the patterns thatshould result. The shaping waters, their path determined by the patterns already formed and the choice ofthe Norns, flow up through the roots of Yggdrasill, whkh are deeply sunken in that-which-is, to shape thegrowth of its branches-becoming within the manifest realms of the tree, and then drip back from its leavesinto the Well (the cycle described by the runeuruz),adding another layer to the world and providing thecontinuation of the patterns which shape the next cycle.The understanding of Teutonic thought is that the continuum of being is essentially organic andinteractive, with each part growing naturally from the other. Bauschatz suggests that only those actionswhich are directly derived from the major paths of the water from the Well are significant in shaping theturnings of Wyrd [5], but it would seem more fitting to suggest that, since the Well of Wyrd en-compasses all of being, that the distinction lies in the level of the Well upon which various types of actionoperate. In this context one rnay see that the major actions determined by the Well of Urdhr flow back toUrdhr, their outcoming in becoming determining the shape of major events that should follow. Thoselesser events, which are shaped by the greater turnings of Wyrd but which do not affect it except insofaras they bear out the patterns determined by the actions derived from the workings of Urdhr, flow backinto the Well of Mimir, where they are incorporated into the general world. Finally, the force from all theevents which do not flow directly into Urdhr sinks to Hvergelmir (from which it will push upward againin due course); “from there all waters have their way.” [6] The individualweirdis that pattern which the actions of your ancestors and previous lifetimeshave shaped for your own life. It is not in any way predestination; your own actions can be consciouslychanged for the sake of shaping your own weird.10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"This process of actively shaping the patterns of Wyrd is done by, among other things, cutting andcoloring the runes, which has the effect of writing them straight into the Well of Urdhr, from which theywill flow to directly influence the manifest worlds of Yggdrasill. Because of the all-holding nature ofMimir, what has been written can never be unwritten-Wyrd is inescapable; but it can be written around.You may see this in the story of Starkadhr, in which Odhinn and Thorr take turns writing and rewritingtheweirdof Starkadhr, one writing for weal and the other for woe. Odhinn says that Starkadhr willalways be victorious in baffle, Thorr replies that he will always be wounded grievously; Qdhinn givesStarkadhr the gift of poetry. Thorr decrees that he will never remember his own staves; Thorr doomsStarkadhr to be the last of his line, Odhinn gifts him with a life three times as long as an ordinary man’s,Thorr adds that Starkadhr must do one dastardly deed (of betrayal) in each lifetime1 and so forth. Thissame idea shows up in the Germanic children’s story of Sleeping Beauty, in which one of the fairies (asurvival of the lesser Norns who attend each person at childbirth) cannot take off the other’s curse ofdeath for the young princess but can only modify it to a hundred years of sleep. This is precisely thepower of the runes: to write Wyrd, and write around it at need(nauthiz),For this reason, it is good to castthe runes several times in a working so as to avoid unknowingly writing your own doom. You should readthe runes before acting to see what is likely to happen if you do nothing, again if you do the work asplanned, and a third time after the work has been done to see what is now written.11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"3: THE TEUTONIC MAGICIAN: BODY, SOUL, ANDMINDIn Teutonic thought, your being is divided into several different parts which work differently, but must allfunction harmoniously if you are to do well on any level. As Teutonic magical workings call for theworking of these several sides of the mage’s being, it is necessary to know the form and function of each.Preferred terminology varies greatly with practitioners; Old Norse, archaic English, and modern Englishwill be used as seems fitting. An index of terms is provided in the Glossary.LICH (body)The Teutonic magician is expected to be strong of body as well as mind and soul. The body is the earthlyvehicle for your magical force, and it must be capable of carrying, sustaining, and feeding that power asmightily as possible. Physical control is important; you will do well to take up the study of martial artsalong with magic, if possible.Fasting is useful only as an aid to meditation and vision; active magic requires your fullestenergies. Hence it is good to eat two to four hours before a ritual, so that you may be receiving thestrength of your food, but not suffer any loss of sensitivity (food does tend to close down or dull psychicactivity). It is also healthy to eat something with a lot of protein when you have completed your working.Vegetarianism is wholly outside of any Northern tradition; while a meatless diet that contains a full rationof protein and other nutrients will not be harmful to Teutonic workings, it will certainly not aid yourspiritual growth in any special way as it would in most Eastern traditions. Alcohol should be drunk inreligious and inspirational rituals, but not before or during works of active magic where the vitki’s controlneeds to be at its fullest. With the possible exception of the highly poisonous fly agaric, there is no cleartradition of using mind-altering substances in Teutonic mysticism. There are hints in the Eddic writingsconcerning the use of various parts of the yew tree(taxus baccata),but all parts of this tree areexceedingly poisonous. I personally know of one modern rune-worker who almost killed himself byinhaling smoke from burning yew berries. DO NOT experiment with these plants.Hair and beard, as the signs and embodiments of your life-force, play a great role in Teutonicthought and mysticism. These should be grown as long as your circumstances permit and carefullytended. Before rituals, you should brush till the hair literally crackles and sparks with electricity,concentrating on the might of the hamingja-force (life energy/mana) you are bringing forth to readiness,Hair, blood, and bodily warmth are all the earthly embodiments and the vehicles of the hamingja-force.SOULThe termsoulis used in this book to include all the non-physical aspects of the magician: hamingja, hide,fetch, valkyrja, and mind are all parts of the soul.SPIRITThe termspiritis used descriptively here to distinguish that which functions on the earthly realm fromthat which functions in the hidden realms: “vision of the spirit” as the capability to see the non-physical,for instance.HAMINGJAThe hamingja will be somewhat discussed under Ritual. It is your personal reserve of power, roughlyanalogous to the general concept of mana. In later sources, the hamingja is sometimes confused with thefylgja(fetch). It is certainly the source of the fylgja’s power, so the strength of that spirit is alwaysrelative to the strength of your hamingja, though the exact degree of relation may vary with a number offactors. The hamingja power can certainly be separated from the fetch, or that part of the soul can begiven extra might. The hamingja is characterized as fiery energy.12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"HAMR (hide, shape)The hamr is the subtle body underlying your earthly body, which normally has the same shape as thephysical form, though it can be changed. It maybe compared to the astral body of traditional Westernworkings. It is the shape in which the soul-complex fares forth from the lich.FYLGJA (fetch)The fylgja is the animal-form showing the soul’s inner nature and the person’s condition. It can be seenby those gifted with spirit-sight; to the unmagical, it only appears just before one’s death. It is usually aguardian, whose might works-both in magickal and in physical struggles, the outcome of which oftendepends on the strength of the fylgja-form and the hamingja which empowers it. The fetch is oftenconfused with thedisir(see Wights, chapter 18) or the valkyrja, and the fact that some fylgjur appear aswomen rather than animals adds to this confusion. For the same reason, the hamingja is also confusedwith these, especially with thekinfylgjawho holds the reservoir of a family’s ancestral hamingja andwisdom (see Othala, chapter7).The disir, however, are independent wights, while the valkryja, unlike thefylgja, cannot be commanded or seen by spirit-sight at any given time. The knowledge told you by thefetch should not, unless it is a message from another being, be taken as any sort of higher wisdom; itsjudgment is that of an animal, which may sense antipathy or danger and can perceive information that isnot normally available to the vitki. It should be treated only as a guide in a limited sense, like a seeing-eye-dog rather than a teacher.VALKYRJAThe valkryja is the highest aspect and the guardian and guide of the soul. She is the source of spiritualwisdom and the intermediary between Asgardhr and the individual. She acts at all times like anindependent being, and it requires a great deal of spiritual effort to reach a state of consciouscommunication with her. Her nature is highly complex. She is described fully in chapter 8.MINDThe termmindis used in this book to describe the awareness and cognitive ability which encompassesbothhugr,“thought,” andminni,“memory” (embodied by Odhinn’s ravens Hnginn and Muninn). Thehugr is consciousness and analytical reason; the minni, the storehouse of all forms of memory, includingthat of the semi-independent parts of the soul, ancestral memory, and the Jungian collective unconscious.This memory is eidetic and endless, and one of the greatest goals of the Teutonic magician is to bringforth the wisdom that lies hidden in its darkness - to learn from “Mimir’s Head.” Until the hugr has beentrained to receive knowledge through the sight and hearing of the spirit, messages from the hidden wightsabout one will reach it only through the minni, often surfacing as “feelings” or seemingly irrationalchoices. Although one’s thought and memory seldom communicate fully, they are never separated fromeach other.13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SECTION II: MAGICAL THOUGHTAND WORKING4: EARTHLY HISTORY OF THE RUNESThe runic alphabet, or futhark, seems to have come forth into earthly being sometime between the thirdand first centuries B.C.E. (Before Common Era). Before that, the Germanic people had no writing assuch, although they did have the holy and magical signs such as the quartered sun-wheel, swastika, ship,and so forth, which they carved in rock in their burial mounds and other ritual places, and which they mayhave carved into wood for purposes of divination.The Elder Futhark as we know it seems to have grown largely from the North Italic script of thelast few centuriesB.C.E.,although Latin and Greek influences can be seen in it as well, as can some of thenative Germanic holy symbols. It is thought that the knowledge of the runes must have spread northwardand eastward from the alpine area; though no runic artifacts have survived along the path of themigration, the North Italic origin is virtually certain.Runic symbols may have first been used on perishable materials for casting lots, a practice withwhich the Germanic peoples were already familiar. The art of carving them into stone and metal wouldthen have come later, although a helmet (the Negau helm) exists which bears a North Italic inscription ina Germanic language, reading HARIGASTI TEIWAI, a usage which is typical of runic working. Theinscription may mean either “to the god harigast” or “Harigast and Teiwaz” (Odhinn and Tyr).[1] Theoldest known runic inscription is that of the Meldorf Brooch, which was found in western Jutland and isdated at roughly 50 C.E. The Elder Futhark developed into a number of slightly differing runic alphabets as a consequenceof sound-shifts in changing languages. In Scandinavia, some of the symbols were dropped and otherswere used for more than one sound, while many of the runes were simplified or altered. This eventuallyled to two slightly different sixteen-rune futharks, the Danish and the Swedish-Norwegian. The Danishform, dating from the ninth century to the eleventh, is considered to be roughly the standard, and isgenerally referred to as the Younger Futhark. The Anglo-Saxon Futhark added nine runes to the ElderFuthark and’ changed some of the stave-shapes and sound values slightly. The reason for expanding thefuthark instead of condensing it may lie in the fact that the Anglo-Saxon Futhark was becoming more andmore used for writing and mundane purposes, while the Younger Futhark remained largely a magicalscript for a long time, making readability a secondary concern. As this purpose diminished inScandinavia, a system of dots to distinguish phonetic value evolved.The runes seem to have reached Scandinavia and the eastern part of Europe sometime around thethird centuryC.E. [2]It is thought that they were spread by wandering tribes, in particular the Heruli, whowere known for their runic wisdom and whose name, ErilaR, seems to have become a title for someoneespecially skilled in runecraft. The Scandinavian inscriptions which show the full Elder Futhark date fromthe fifth and sixth centuries. These inscriptions have been found on both bracteates (medallions) andstones. The futhark order is consistent except for the last two runes, dagaz and othala, which arefrequently inverted both in the oldest and more recent futharks, and a single inscription which reverses thethirteenth and fourteenth runes, perthro and eihwaz. The division of theaettir(“eights” or “families”) isalso consistent. The 24-rune futhark is divided into three aettir of eight runes each, and the attributions ofrunes to their aettir was preserved even when the futhark no longer contained three sets of eight runes.14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"With the slow growth of Christianity in the north, the use of runes in magic was forced to15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"diminish, although the evidence of memorial stones that were carved in nominally Christian times showsthat some of the old lore remained above ground centuries after it had supposedly been suppressed. In themore isolated parts of Iceland and Scandinavia, the practice of the native magic survived among the folkfor a long time. Some hints of runic knowledge also survived in rural areas in Germany, but such lore asmight have been hidden in the traditions of the German folk was largely destroyed by the immenseupheavals suffered by that country as a result of World Wars I and II. [3] The magical revival of the runic system was begun by Guido von List at the beginning,of thetwentieth century. Von List guided by the Havamal and a mystical experience he underwent duringeleven months of blindness (following a cataract operation), worked the Younger Futhark into aneighteen-rune system which is known as the Armanen Futhark. The magical groups working with thissystem were generally suppressed during the Nazi regime; the Armanen Orden was not revived until1969.Although a fair body of writing on runic magic existed in German, there were no reliable bookson runic workings published in English until Edred Thorsson’sFuthark: A Handbook of Rune Magiccame out in 1984. As well as reviving the oldest and most magically powerful runic system, the ElderFuthark, within the traditional context of Germanic magic and world-view, he made the most usefulelements of the German system available to the English-speaking public. Thorsson is the founder of theRune-Gild, an organization formed for the systematic teaching and study of runecraft.16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"5: MAGICAL HISTORY OF THE RUNESWhile the time of human discovery of the runes can be charted and analyzed, it is only a small part ofrunic lore. Far more important is their origin outside of human time and workings, which holds themystery of their power-their discovery by Odhinn, the gift of the runes to humankind, and the use madeof them by those who were heir to the full body of runic lore, a body which the modern vitki seeks to bothreconstruct and expand.The runes existed in a potential state within the ice of Niflheimr, the fire of Muspellheimr, andthe void of Gingunnagap before the world was created. The interaction of ice and fire created the proto-being Ymir, whom Thorsson identifies with hagalaz, the rune which is the “seed crystal” of the order ofthe Teutonic cosmos,[1] and the cow Audhumbla, the shaping force working to bring forth the full runicorder and manifestation. This process was completed when Odhinn/Vili/Ve’ slew Ymir and shaped thecosmos from his body, bringing the runic forces into full being by setting them forth into form. The runescan be found in all things, especially things of power, as listed in the Sigrdrifumal: on the shield that stands before the shining god . . On the paw of the bear and on Bragi’s tongue, on the wolf’s claw and on the eagle’s beak, on the bloody wings and on the bridge’s end, on the loosening palms and on the healing step... [2]Some of these items literally have runes written on them; others seem to be mighty carriers of thepower which is that of the runes.Although the workings of the runes in coming forth into being hadguided the shaping of the cosmos, they could not be known by conscious beings until the final union ofthought with form, which was realized by Odhinn’s sacrifice of himself on Yggdrasill. By hanginghimself on the World-Tree, which held the entire shape of being, he performed a rite of shamanicinitiation that enabled him to fare downward into Hel-the silent keeper of the roots of the World- Tree-and, in a single instant of inspiration, realize the entirety of the runes. His sacrifice of self to self-of thegod to the greater needs of the god-gave him the might which he needed to carry forth this faring,remaining aware through his death and descent. I know that I hung on the wind-tossed tree, all of nine nights, wounded by spear, and given to Odhinn, myself to myself, on that tree of which no man knows from what roots it doth rise. They dealt me no bread, nor drinking horn. I looked down, I drew up the runes Screaming I took them up,and fell back from there.” [3] This cry was the firstgaldrasingle proto-word of power that encompassed the entire essence of therunes, filling Odhinn’s whole being with their might.Having learned the runes, Odhinn gave them to other beings through a draught of holy mead,which was probably Odhroerir, the mead of poetry.[4] The potential to learn and use their power wasgiven to humankind at their creation by Hoenir, one side of Odhinn’s being (see Odhinn, chapter 16) asthe gift of odhr, godly inspiration. This potential was brought forth fully by Heimdallr, who, afterfathering the three classes of human society, taught runic wisdom to the first noble and his youngest son,Kon. Runic wisdom is also taught directly by a hero’s valkyrja, by Odhinn in some of his many disguises,and, it is hinted, by Mimir. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Magical lore was usually, though not always, passed down through direct family lines or thefamily ties of fostering. There were no particular restrictions on gender in learning, teaching, or practicingrunic magic; the common modern belief that wisdom must pass from man to woman and woman to manhas no place in Teutonic tradition, with the theorized exception of certain teachings involving sexualexchange together with and as a part of magical lore. [5]Most of what is known today about the historical use of runes in magic is either reconstructedfrom the inscriptions on surviving items or from references in the sagas, which hold a number of usefuldescriptions of the method of practicing runic magic. The entire futhark was written on some items,particularly bracteates, which might have been worn as talismans by practicing runemasters or used assymbols of the Odhinnist cult, since a number of them also bear images which are characteristic ofOdhinn-worship. [6] Most of the inscriptions state their purpose or a part of their purpose, althoughencoding is common even within these writings. You must remember that, especially in the earlier runicperiod, that which was written was meant magically and could be read only by hdtiates; even seeminglyordinary memorial inscriptions were not to be read by the general public and often contained a number oflayers of meaning hidden beneath the known words. Other inscriptions are wholly secret and cannot beunderstood except by considering the magical purpose of the individual runes. Runic magic in the sagas is done by carving and coloring the runes, together with magicalchanting, as written forth in the Grettis saga: A woman cuts runes on the root of an uprooted tree,reddening them with her blood, sings over them, and walks backwards and widdershins about the treewhile casting her spell. She then sends it into the ocean, saying over it that it shall go to Drangey and doGrettir harm. The tree floats up on the shore of the island; when Grettir tries to cut it for firewood, his axebounces off and gives him a wound which becomes mortally infected, and his foes are finally able to killhim. [7] This is characteristic of the working of Teutonic magic: rather than the fireballs of Tolkien’sGandalf, it is the subtle turning of Wyrd. Of course, as your experience and power grow, you will be ableto cause results more swiftly, depending on the complexity of your working. Egill Skallagrimsson, thegreatest rune-master of the Viking Age (d. 990), was able to cause a horn of poisoned ale to burst with acarving composed of a single rune repeated several times (see laguz, chapter 7), and by scraping off andrecarving runes written by an unskilled boy, was able at once to heal a girl who had been suffering underthe miscast spell for some time. The swift effect in both these cases was due to the simplicity andimmediacy of the situation, and also to the fact that Egill was working a counter-magic which broke theeffect of bale at once. However, when he carved a nidhing-pole to drive Eirik Bloodaxe and QueenGunnhild out of the land, a much more complex formula and ceremony were needed, and the spell tooksome time to work, as it involved a great turning of Wyrd for a whole country. The most direct and effective workings are those which affect mind and soul, such as the laying ofbattle-fetter (frozen panic in a crisis) or the seeming change of a person into an animal that occurs whenthe animal-fylgja is forced (or allowed) to take over that person’s body and mind completely (asdescribed in the Hrolfs Saga Kraka when the witch Hvit turns the king’s son Bjorn into a ravening bear bystriking him with a wolfskin glove). In most cases, these workings belong more properly to the class ofseidh-magic, which deals directly with affecting soul and consciousness rather than the turning of externalevents and circumstances. However, it is possible to use runic magic for these purposes. Odhinn caused afrenzy in Vali’s mother Rind by touching her with a rune-written piece of bark, and a rune-written horn ofmead was given to Guthrun so that she could recover from her sorrow over Sigurdhr. [8]18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6: RUNIC THEORY: LEARNING THE RUNESThe goal in runic workings is to control the power of the runes so as to create the effect you want. For thispurpose, it is first necessary to have a deep knowledge of the runes themselves and secondly necessary tounderstand the ways in which they may be used and the reasons why they work as they do. Something ofthis has already been spoken of under the Well of Wyrd; this chapter will deal with the more activeaspects of runic theory. The runes may be thought of as forces which come forth into being and shape it:collectively, they embody the entire that-which- is/is becoming/should become. There are many differentways of coming to know and use their might, but all of these come down to the drawing of these forcesinto yourself and guiding them forth to work your will. Some forms of runic magic require no tools otherthan the trained mind and will. The most durable and complex, however, call for an earthly vessel intowhich the runes may be carved so that their might continues to flow from it until the streams of power areactively broken by the destruction of the “body.” The advantage of these practices is sometimes offset bythe fact that it is more difficult to carve and color runes unnoticed than it is to shape and send their forceout to your target; but something which is properly charged with runic force and bound can hold thecharge as long as is needed for most purposes, though it cannot renew its flow as a carvedtaufr(talisman)does.While the nature of Teutonic terminology may make it seem rather paradoxical to talk aboutsetting the runes into the Well of Wyrd in one chapter and about using their forces directly to achieve anend in the next, there is actually no paradox implied. When you make a medicine to heal someone, forinstance, you may have laid a layer in the process of writing them a weird of health, but until you havecaused it to be used for that purpose, you will not have completed the writing of that weird. To beeffective, the magic of the runes must be applied and directed according to their own rules and the basiclaws that rule all forms of esoteric power. To write weird is to act; but to write it wittingly, you mustunderstand your actions and their effects.In learning the runes you will find that there are two ways by which you must approach them; theway of the mind and the way of the soul. The way of the mind is that of research, logic, numericalcalculation, and experimental evaluation; the way of the soul is that of meditation, feeling, and practice.Neither way alone can teach you the workings of the runes. The first by itself leads to barrenness, thesecond to delusion. In this book I have striven to present a well- rounded basis for the vitki to build her/his own working and understanding on, but as this is largely a work of the mind, it is needful for eachperson to balance what he/she learns here with personal thought and practice.With all the methods ofmeditation, as with one’s practical workings, it is necessary to keep agaldrabok(magical diary) in whichone records new lore and rites, all that one experiences in meditation and practice, as well as everythingthat happens in daily life which seems to touch on one’s path as a vitki.MEDITATIONThe first step in understanding the runes in one’s soul, after one has set them firmly in one’s mind, ismeditation. It is best to begin by meditating on each rune on your own. This can be done in many ways,each of which has a somewhat different effect. It is good to begin by staring at the shape of the rune andintoning either its name or the galdr-sound (mantra) associated with it. Thorsson suggests that each runebe painted in red on an index card [1] and this is likely the easiest way to set them into one’s awareness.This should be done for five minutes or so, at a rate of one rune a day. It is best to do it in the morningwhen getting up, trying to visualize the rune at intervals during the day; or else just before going to bed,writing down one’s dreams in the morning. Of course, meditation can be performed at any time. Another practice which some people find works well is the use ofstadhagaldrorrunenyoga(standingwith one’s body in the shape of a rune for the purpose of drawing in its force). This practice wasdeveloped by the Armanen-runeworkers in Germany. Its antiquity is not too well known, althoughartifacts showing the human body twisted into shapes like those of the runes, and the modem Icelandicpractice of teaching children the alphabet by having them stand in letter-shapes, may support it. Thismethod is beyond the scope of this book; a full description of how to use it and its effects, together withthe positions, may be found in Edred Thorsson’s Futhark: A Handbook of Runic Magic.19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Meditation may also be done by simply sitting and concentrating one’s entire self on a single runeto see what one can feel or find within it. The key to successful meditation of any sort is the ability toconcentrate on one’s object in all ways. To do this, it is necessary first to clear the mind and body of whatis unwanted, and then to fill them with what is wanted. True concentration-letting nothing within orwithout pull one from one’s goal-is one of the hardest things to learn and one of the most necessary in anykind of magic. When your concentration breaks, do not be angry or upset; this will only make yourdistraction much, much worse. Settle down and try again. In practice, the aim of full concentration canbest be reached by good meditative breath control, such as is used in yoga and some martial arts. Inhaledeeply, not with the chest and shoulders, but from the gut. Your stomach should swell outward, yourshoulders staying utterly still. Pull the breath in slowly, filling your lungs from the bottom; hold the air infor a couple of seconds, then let your breath out just as slowly as you let it in, and hold it out for a coupleof seconds before breathing in again. It will help to begin with a slow, regular mental count which is thesame for the inward and outward breath, and for the short holding of fullness and emptiness. The exactnumber is not important, although it should be the same for each cycle; a number may be chosenaccording to personal convenience and understanding of Teutonic number lore. GUIDED MEDITATIONSThe purpose of the guided meditations supplied in this book is to provide a footing for an emotional andpsychic understanding of the runes, in addition to the mental understanding gained by study and rationalcontemplation. These meditations may, and indeed should be used in conjunction with individualmeditation as scribed above, so that you can balance a personal understanding of. each rune with anunderstanding of the runic force and cultural background evoked by the guided meditation. Thesemeditations offer a series of images and mental processes designed to aid your spiritual attunement to theforce of each rune and to use the understanding of each rune’s essential nature to tie together some of thevarious levels on which and ways in which it operates. Using them should serve to bring your personalawareness (consciously and subconsciously) closer to the mindset of the Teutonic world in which theforce of the runes was expressed and defined, thus making it easier, both psychologically and psychically,to tap, channel, and control the might of the runes. The meditations may be thought of as a psychic tuningfork, which you use initially to achieve the desired vibrational quality and level (the vibration of the rune)for the purpose of being able to recognize, touch, and use that particular stream of power at will. The guided meditations offered here may be changed to fit your individual needs; they arecertainly not meant to limit anyone in any way. If you do not choose to use them as guided meditations,you may find it worthwhile to simply think on the images within the context of the rune with which theyare associated. I created these meditations for the benefit of my first rune class in order to synthesize thehistorical and magical data I was giving them into a form capable of speaking to heart, mind, and soul atonce. I had previously observed the effectiveness of pathworkings in my own assimilation of Qabalisticsymbolism and lore, and felt that some of the techniques used in that school would also work in runicstudies. These guided meditations are based on images and understandings reached by myself in my owncontemplation of the runes, combined with my research into the thought-patterns and imagery (bothvisual and poetic) of the Teutonic folk. If you choose to use these writings as guided meditations, you may either tape yourself readingthem aloud or have them read by a friend or one person in a small group. To perform them, you should sitor lie with your eyes shut in a comfortable position which is not likely either to become cramped or toencourage you to fail asleep. Wear clothes which do not bind, particularly about the chest and abdomen.Allow a little time in which you can breathe in a deep, regular rhythm, letting all your tension anddistracting thoughts flow out, before you begin the meditation itself. At the end of the meditation, it isvery important to picture yourself in your own body again with your feet firmly grounded on the earth, aswritten forth in the text. This is called grounding, and it is done to prevent the psychic and mentaldisorientation which occurs when your awareness, having functioned outside of your earthly body, is notfully brought back into it; or when you have brought a great deal of magical energy into yourself which,unless it is directed to some purpose at once or settled by the act of grounding which brings one back tofull earthly functioning, can disorder the mind - sometimes severely.20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"GALDR-SONGSIn the Norse texts, runic magic is often described as galdr-magic, as opposed to the more shamanic formsof spae- and seidhmagic. The wordgaldrcomes from a root meaning “to sing or chant,” which shows theneedfulness of vibrating the rune-sounds and magical songs on all levels in order to bring their power intofull being. As a meditative means, the chanting of the galdr-sounds will cause your very body, as well asthe world around you, to vibrate with the might of the rune upon which you are calling. You should begin training yourself by practicing meditative breathing for some time until it feelsquite natural. When you are able to control your breath and establish a strong regular rhythm, you shouldstart singing the galdr-sound (given individually with each rune) on the outward breath and subvocalizingit on the inward breath, being sure to continue to breathe from the diaphragm. The sound should, at leastat first, be sung on a single tone. This should be as low and loud as is comfortable for your voice, in orderto create the maximum resonance within your body. You should be able to feel the resonance within andaround you growing in power as you sing the galdr-sounds on the outward breath of each cycle, while thesubvocalized songs of the inward breath intensify the runic might in your spirit so that you can bring itforth more mightily on the exhalation. After a while, you may find alterations of tone to be morepowerful; once you have mastered the basic skill of galdr-singing, this is a worthwhile path ofexperiment. If the full rune name is used, each of the sounds should be prolonged as long as possible, so thatone complete exhalation is required to sing the name once. This should hold true in magical rites whenone is using runic sounds or names as well as in meditation. The use of galdr-sounds in meditation is alsoa good way to learn to vibrate one’sgaldrar(“magical songs”-vocal part of the enchantment) in activemagic so that the words resonate through your body and all the levels of being, bringing the silent andhidden force of the runes on which you call and of the words which shape and guide their might forth intoearthly being. The resonance of the song is one of the major gateways through which power is broughtbetween the worlds!BRINGING THE RUNES FORTHWhen you have worked your way through the futhark in one, or all if possible, of these manners, you willbe ready to begin using the runes outside of yourself. Meditation and seeking, of course, never end aslong as you live, but after you have brought these basics within yourself, your individual path is up toyou. The best way to start bringing the runes forth is by sitting in a dark room with your eyes open.Choose a rune with which you have done well in meditation and begin to breathe, singing the name ofthat rune until you can feel its might within. Slowly stretch out your strong hand, index finger out, andtrace the stave-shape in the air. The shining power, in red or a fitting color, should flow through yourhand and eyes in a brilliant beam so that you can in some manner see the rune you have written there.Should this not be easy for you, close your eyes and visualize its bright lines before you, looking throughthe eyes of your soul. When you can see it in this manner, open your eyes again. This may take somepractice, but in time you should be able to see at least the shining ghost of the lines of power you havewritten. Once you have finished your practice, you should either draw the rune’s energies into yourself ordissipate it back into the universe. It is bad practice to leave about any sort of magical energy which is notclearly bound to a specific goat and done over a period of time it can be dangerous. This should be practiced until you are able to do the Circle Rite easily and comfortably. Whenyou are comfortable with the basic internalization and theoretical function to the point that you can usethis simple ritual to ward yourself you will be ready to begin performing active runic magic. RUNIC WORKINGS“Know’st how to write, know’st how to read, Know’st how to stain, how to understand, Know’st how to ask know’st how to offer, Know’st how to supplicate know’st how to sacrifice?”(Havamal, 144)21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The most traditional means of puffing runic magic into effect is the carving and coloring of a runicinscription. This may be done on any suitable material-wood, bone, stone, and metal were the mostcommon materials of the early days, but this should not cause a vitki to feel limited. Although syntheticmaterials lack hamingja-force of their own, by the same token, they are suitable for taking any sort ofcharge which you want to impress upon them. Anything which can be carved, engraved, and/or paintedcan be made into a runic talisman. It was usual for Germanic people to have the items which were mostimportant to them, such as their weapons, written with fitting runes of success; this practice can easily beadjusted to fit modern needs.If wood is used for the talisman, or taufr, the following should be done. Goout into the woods with a bottle of ale or mead and a small loaf of bread. Quietly whisper your purposeand the runes of the rite to the earth, asking Mother Nerthus to show you a suitable tree. Wait silentlyuntil you feel an urge to walk in one direction or another, then follow the feeling until you come to a treethat you sense is the one chosen. Perform the first part of the Rite of Tree-Gift (p.284) and leave withoutlooking back or speaking to anyone until you are home. Return in the same silence to your tree at sunsetor just after, or sunrise or just before, and perform the second part of the rite. With your ritual knife or, ifneedful, a hallowed axe, strike off the twig or branch you have chosen; it should be one bending to aquarter of the earth or an aett of the heavens, north and east being preferred. Cover the wood with a blackcloth and carry it home, again without speaking in any way. In a ritual of healing or other rite concernedwith a person’s growth and well-being, it is actually better to cut the runes into the living tree, on a boughbending towards the east. When carving the runes, you should sing the name or galdrsound of each aslong as you work on it, prolonging the initial sound as long as possible. This should be done in a slowrhythm of deep, regulated breathing from the center of your body, as should all galdr-singing. As youinhale, you should feel the streams of power flowing into your body, filling you with brilliant, tinglingmight; as you carve and sing, you should be able to see the power flowing forth into the grooves you cut,shining brightly in the runes, and feel it thrumming through the sax-knife in your hand. The coloring ofthe runes is the most important part of the process, as it is through coloring that they are brought to life.They are almost always colored red. The blood of the vitki is the most traditional pigment for the runes,as it fills them with her/his life and hamingja-force. Red ochre is also a traditional pigment for the runes;its Anglo-Saxon name,teafor,is cognate to the Old Norse word for talisman, taufr, and the German wordfor magic, Zauber. The root of all of these words means “to make red,” showing the essential tie betweenthe act of reddening the runes and the working of magic. Red ochre is sometimes difficult to find inAmerica, though usually art stores will carry either the dry pigment or an ochre-based paint. Red madderis another good traditional coloring that is much easier to come by in the pure form (though somewhatexpensive). If red ochre or madder is subsituted for blood, you should grind the raw pigment with linseedoil, singing the names of the runes and charging the pigment with them through the pestle as you wouldchargerecels(incense) during its grinding; this may also be well-empowered with a single drop of blood.The blood or ochre should be laid into the runes with the point of the sax or, if you prefer, with a specialtool. While doing this, you should sing the lines of galdr for each rune by which you are guiding thesphere of its workings, feeling the runic might flow ever more powerfully through your body to glow inthe newly livened runes. It is best in every way to have the entire ritual thoroughly memorized so that youmay concentrate fully on the might which you summon and guide into the runes written on the taufr.Further steps are more or less optional depending on your needs and level of experience with rune-magic:someone who has worked with runic energies and ritual for many years will naturally have less need ofoutward forms than someone who has just been doing it for a while. The practice of full ritual is of greatbenefit to the beginning and intermediate students, both because the changesit makes within the worker.As with all skills, constant practice and testing your limits are the keys to growth and success.An example of a full scale ritual for creating a runic taufr may be found in chapter 21 under Riteof Carving.22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"7: RUNES OF THE ELDER FUTHARKFEHUGaldr-sound: ffffffff (a hissing f; like the crackle of flames)Letter:FMoney is a comfort toeveryone though every man ought to deal it out freely if he wants to gain approval from the lord.— Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem(Gold) causes strife among kinsmen the wolf grows up in the woods.— Old Norse Rune Rhyme(Money) is the strife among kinsmen and the fire of the flood-tide and the path of the serpent.— Old Icelandic Rune PoemOne is called help and will help you in all sickness / sorrow and affliction. — Havamal 146The rune namefehuliterally means “cattle,” which were the measure of wealth in the earliest period ofGermanic history. As the society developed, the power embodied by the cattle themselves was transferredto the gold with which one could buy them. Both served in turn as the physical representation of themobile energy which manifests as money in human dealings. The rune fehu is translated as “wealth” or“gold” in the rune poems, but its etymological origin continues to suggest the strength of fertility and life-force which are essential aspects of this stave. war between the Aesir and the Vanir.[3]This war couldonly be ended by the giving of hostages the use of the power of gebo to harness fehu (as hinted at in theAnglo-Saxon Rune Poem) by channeling its energies into the binding of exchange.

The energy of fehu must be kept in motion or it becomes tainted. This is themeaning behind the stories of dragons gold being poisoned.The connection between wealth, fertility, and general life-energy is visible in the nature of the goddessFreyja and the god Freyr, whose powers govern prosperity and well-being in all their forms. Both Freyja23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"and Freyr are deities of the fertile earth and of riches-one of Freyr’s titles is Frodhi, the Fruitful, andFreyja weeps tears of gold. The life-force of these two deities is expressed as joy, sexual energy, andcourage in battle. Both Freyr and Freyja are mighty warriors as well as rulers of prosperity and peace;their nature is energetic in all aspects of being. This is the stave of elemental fire as the primal energyworking through the worlds, the source of fertility, prosperity, and strength. The word “fire” is often usedin kennings for gold, such as “fire of the dragon’s bed”[1] and “fire of the creek,”[2] and gold is oftendescribed as “glow-red,” indicating its essentially fiery nature.The woe-working aspect of fehu is its capability of causing discord, even within the kin-grouping, amongthose who should be most closely bound. As the rune of elemental fire, fehu is always a potential sourceof disruption as well as strength. The working of fehu in this aspect can be seen in the description of howFreyja came to the Aesir as the witch Gullveig, “power of gold” or “intoxication of gold,” with powerover fire and the energies of seidhr magic, and how the discord caused by her presence became the warbetween the Aesir and the Vanir.[3] This war could only be ended by the giving of hostages the use of thepower of gebo to harness fehu (as hinted at in the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem) by channeling its energiesinto the binding of exchange. The tales centering around Andvari’s hoard- the Sigurdhr poems, VolsungaSaga, Niebelungenlied, etc., which tell of a repeated cycle of kin-murder-how the terrible woe which fehucan work if its energies are not carefully controlled and directed in their flowing. The energy of fehu mustbe kept in motion or it becomes tainted. This is the meaning behind the stories of dragons gold beingpoisoned.The fires of fehu in the personal sphere are expressed as the “libido”; that energy which, sexual inorigin, is sublimated and channeled to provide the force behind most human actions. In magic, fehu governs the transfer of energies. You can use it either for projection or for the sakeof drawing energy into yourself to temporarily increase your own power for a working. Repeated use ofthe rune for this purpose will gradually increase the quantities of energy that you can handle at any giventime and will aid the growth of your personal reserves of power. In general the use of fehu with anotherrune will cause a fiery increase in the second rune’s power if fehu is used in a supplementary manner. If,for instance, you were to use fehu with jera for the purpose of enhancing your development of runic skills,it would speed and strengthen your natural spiritual growth to the fullest extent possible while bringing arapid increase in your general power, although the control exerted by jera would prevent that power fromoutstripping your wisdom or your ability to shape and guide it. In working woe, however, you mightcombine fehu with thurisaz to induce a violent and destructive rage, although this combination could beused to aid you in fighting, perhaps as part of a formula for bringing on the berserker rage; or you couldgenerate an illness characterized by extreme fever and pain. In this case, the fiery and discordant energiesof fehu would strengthen and inflame the breaking power and brute force of thurisaz. You must rememberthat the effects of these combinations, as well as being determined by the spoken galdrar which call uponcertain aspects of the runes, are as dependent on the understanding and skills of the runeworker as on therunes themselves. A skilled worker could combine the forces of fehu and isa, fire and ice, for a mightymaking, but in the hands of a novice this pairing could work great woe indeed.As well as drawing external energies into yourself, fehu can also be used for awakening yourpersonal power and sending it outward. The rune poems’ references to “the path of the serpent” (IcelandicRune Poem) and “the wolf grows up in the woods” (Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme) refer to the nature offehu as magical energy itself which is a hidden force in the ordinary person and needs a special effort tobring it into play. The line about the wolf also may refer to Sigurdhr of the Volsungs, whose fatherSigmundr was known for changing shape by means of a wolf’s hide. According to one tradition, Sigurdhrwas raised in the forest, ignorant of his lineage. Only when the time comes for him to slay Regin’sbrother, the dragon Fafnir who holds Andvari’s gold, does he receive the reforged sword of hisfatherwhich represents the strenght that had been hidden within him. In Richard Wagner’s version of thestory, the sword’s name is Nothung, a suggestion of the need-rune nauthiz which holds the means bywhich the hidden fire may be brought forth.Ritually, fehu shows the hamingja or life-force. It is also seen in the unshaped flame of the fire-potor recels-burner.Fehu can be used for increasing fertility, sexual desire, and riches.The stone carnelian, whose name derives from the Latinword for “flesh,” is appropriate to fehu. Its24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"red-gold color represents the fiery gold of the rune’s energies; it is said to energize its holder and bring“good 1uck”- the positive working of energy in your personal sphere. Carnelian is also said to be an aid tofertility, and it is used traditionally as a protection against envy and strife, the woe-working aspects offehu.Green tourmaline works well together with fehu, its swift- moving energies directing the life-forceof fehu into the personal sphere. The green color is fitting when you think of the closeness of fehu toFreyr and Freyja. Green tourmaline is also associated with physical fertility, being used in modern timesas an aid for female hormone problems.Amber is also connected with fehu, being a Freyja-associated twin to gold. It is said that Freyja’stears turn to gold on the land and to amber on the sea. Amber’s energetic properties are visible on everyplane, including the physical, where its energies are expressed as an electrical charge.Fehu: MeditationYou stand in the middle of a furrowed field. The sun is setting in a blaze of red-gold fire on yourright. The air is warm with spring. A soft, mild breeze blows your hair back, stirring your green tunic andcloak. As the sky gets darker, you can see little pinpricks of flame dancing over the soil. You know thatthis is May Eve, and the fire is burning over the flecks of gold in the earth.Far ahead of you, in the shadow of a hill, you see a ghostly blaze burning strongly, marking theplace where a treasure lies buried. You walk across the field towards it, stepping lightly over the dampfurrows. As you walk, you see the faint fiery shapes of women flying across the sky. These are followersof Freyja at their seidh-magic; they have left their woman-hides at home and are visible only as flashes ofmagical energy as they fly to their works. They pass closer and closer to you; you feel your hair pricklingup with surges of power. Looking down, you see that you are also glowing with a faint flame under yourskin.You reach the little rise in the ground where the fire burns most strongly. It tingles as you plungeyour hands into the earth, filling you with the strength to dig more deeply. The soil comes away in greatrich chunks until you reach a huge stone. You breathe deeply and the fire within you flares up as you liftthe stone and easily toss it away. Beneath is a deep hollow filled with glowing red gold, and a grayserpent is coiled around it in slumber. You reach down carefully, but as soon as your bright aura touchesthe snake it raises its head and hisses at you. It brightens until you can hardly look at it glowing red asmolten gold. You stretch out your arms, standing in the position of fehu, chanting: “Fehu-might flow /From gold’s grim worm-warder.“Your watchful strength stolen / Sleep now in silence!” As you chant, a stream of energy flowsfrom the serpent into your upraised left arm until you are entirely filled with its fiery strength, and it dropsits head in sleep, gray and drained.You reach into the hollow and take out the gold. Walking away, you scatter the pieces along thefurrows like seed, a candle-flame burning over each coin. The blazing power that had filled you drainsaway slowly as you do this, until the entire hoard has been sown. Although you still feel full of life andstrength, the urgent flaming might has flowed out of you.Looking back over your path, you see that the field has grown up where you walked and is now talland green. An intense green fire seethes through the earth, pushing up new leaves even as you watch. Thebonfires are springing up around the edges of the field. You can hear the sound of distant singing, and inthe shadows cast by the flames, you can see young people coming together and moving off among thenew green stalks of wheat. You raise your head and hands in thanks to Freyr and Freyja for what youhave been given as you return to your own body, feet firmly planted on the earth, knowing that you canalways draw upon this might through the rune fehu.25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"URUZGaldr-sound: uuuuuuu (oo as in “moon.” Prolonged, steady, forceful, like the lowing of a bull)Letter: U(Aurochs) is fearless and greatly horneda very fierce beast,it fights with its horns, a famous roamer of the moor it is a courageous animal.— Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem(Slag) is from bad ironoft runs the reindeer on the hard snow.— Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme(Drizzle) is the weeping of clouds and the diminisher of the ring of ice and the herdsman’s hate.— Old Icelandic Rune PoemI know another that is needed by the sons of men, who want to be leeches. — Havamal 147The rune-nameuruzmeans “aurochs,” the mighty, wild bovine of ancient times, which was an object ofveneration among the Germanic peoples. As fehu, the domestic beeve, is the rune of energies suited toconscious control and shaping, so uruz, the wild animal, is the rune of the powerful unconscious-shapingenergies of the universe which can only be guided by the wise one. The rune poems link this stave to theprocess of purification and shaping embodied by the cow Audhumbla and the alchemical process ofevaporation and condensation. Both “slag” and “drizzle” speak of the endless process of patterning,cleansing, and reshaping which is the work of uruz. In the larger context of world and being, the rune-shape shows the path of the water rising from the Well of Urdhr shaping the growth of the World-Tree,and flowing back down from its leaves into the well, continually renewing the life of the tree and healingthe wounds made by all the wights that gnaw on it. Uruz is the rune of Wyrd as an active force (theupward stroke) and also the rune used to direct the magical shaping will into the Well of Urdhr (thedownward stroke).As well as embodying the process of shaping and setting forth into being throughout the Nine Worlds,uruz also represents the unconscious life-force shown by the strength and “fierceness” of the aurochs. AsAudhumbla was the first source of nourishment for all wights, so the rune uruz makes the primal, “ur” -energies available for use. The twinned might of uruz as shaping power and nourishing might is writtenforth as the two beasts on the roof of Valhalla. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Heithrun, the goat is called, who stands in Warfather’s hall and eats of Laerath’s limbs, She fills the vat full of bright mead. That drink cannot be drained. Fikthyrnir, the hart is called who stands in Warfather’s hall and eats of Laerath’s limbs. Drops fall from its horn to Hvergelmir. From there all waters have their way. 1The stave-shape of uruz also shows the horns of the aurochs. They point downward rather than upward,showing the animal ready to charge. The best-known quality of the historical aurochs was its untameableferocity, which to the ancient Germanic people was a sign of its overflowing spiritual vitality. Its hornswere embodiments of this potency, and also represented the capability to pierce into other worlds. TheGermanic peoples sometimes wore horned helms in ritual for this reason: the warrior/vitki has access toall realms and is master of all. By defeating the aurochs and drinking from his horn, the warrior assumedthe animal’s strength, power, and pride of place. Uruz is the rune by which the vitki rules the “lands”around him/herself, just as the aurochs ruled the moors.The rune uruz is best known as a rune of healing, since it draws life-force from all the realms and brings itinto being according to the initial pattern which is held in the genetic structure of the body (see hagalaz).It both shapes and maintains the health and strength which are necessary to sustain the intense efforts ofmagic and to withstand the strain which prolonged use of energies puts on the user.Uruz is used to aid in the growth of “wisdom” within you; that is to say, the deep-rooted, semiconsciousawareness of the patterns of being and the way in which the waters of Urdhr are flowing. It can be used tobring your awareness to the workings of nature and the ebb and flow of natural energies. Uruz can beused in the personal sphere to bring you courage and physical strength and to enhance your independenceand leadership abilities.In workings of woe, uruz can be used either to control another directly or to put that person at the mercyof internal or external forces which he/she cannot control. More frequently, it is used to strengthenyourself and bring you wisdom needed to gain victory in a struggle. In using uruz to enhance your ownpower, you must remember that it is a primal and wild force which requires streght to work with. As theGermanic warrior had to overcome the physical aurochs to prove his fitness, so the vitki must be able todo this on the mental and spiritual plane.Used with other runes, uruz works to bring them into being on all levels of reality and to send them intothe Well of Urdhr, as described above. It is the power by which you can shape the patterns of your weirdand by which those patterns are brought forth; it is the working of Wyrd’s water, as laguz is the wateritself and perthro is the Well.As a rune of warding, uruz can be used against forces of breaking both to maintain the patterns thatalready exist within your own sphere and to either turn those energies back to their source or to use themfor your own weal.Ritually, uruz represents the act of drinking or pouring a hallowed draught from the horn or cup.In its aspect as the horns piercing the walls between the worlds, uruz can be called upon to bring aboutvisions or to make speaking between realms easier.The stone associated with uruz is tiger’s eye, which is traditionally said to bring courage, confidence, andstrength, and which calls forth life force and brings it into your own being. The eyelike gleam of light inthis stone hints at the horns of uruz piercing the realms of being so that a ray of brightness shines through.Your mouth is dry and parched with thirst in spite of the cold. You scoop up a freezing handful of waterand taste it, but it is so frothy and bitter that you spit it out at once.

Looking behindyou, you see a great fire far away in the darkness, shedding light over the nothingness and throwingoff torrents of flames and glowing sparks.The cloud slowly draws together, solidifying into the form of a great wild cow. She licks eagerlyat the soiled rim of ice, her tongue wearing it away. A river of sweet milk flows from her udders; as youdrink, you feel her untamed might strengthening you. The shaggy, dark giant who stands above youreaches up to his full height, stretching over the great cow, his head so high that you cannot make outany of his features. With one last mighty roar he spreads his arms and they turn into huge branches.The cow blurs into a mist, surrounding you with cloudy grayness.When the mist clears, you see that you are standing on a lush green field at the foot of a treewhose trunk reaches up into the clouds, growing out of the great well before you. Sparkling waterpours over the sides of the well, splashing over the tree and healing the ragged gashes in its bark. Ashower of dew drips down from the needles above you, some of it falling back into the well and some ofit soaking into the white clay around it. Moving forward, you put your hand to the side of the tree,where it emerges from the well and feel the mighty waters pulsing up through it with a rhythm like avast heartbeat.

He dips hishorns down, ready to gore and toss. Easily you leap up over his head, holding the rough horns tobalance yourself as you ride his back. You are almost overwhelmed by the might of the beast beneathyou; but slowly you gain control, melding into him until you yourself have become the mighty aurochs,the fierce warrior-beast who rules this land.When you have run long enough, you stop and stand up, the aurochs-power still flowingthrough you as you regain your human form. On your head is a horned helmet, the sign of yourmastery. Like the aurochs, you toss your head, and light flows through the air where your horns pierceit. You know that you have the power to pierce the veils between the realms at will and to master theother worlds as you have mastered this one, but the time has not yet come for you to fare further.

Thenature of thurisaz is phallic and aggressive, as is the shape of the rune itself. The rune-poem referencesmake clear the forceful aspects of phallocentric sexuality shown by thurisaz. Thurisaz is the rune of forth-rushing power as brute force; it is the strength which makes the thurse-kind so frightful to the orderedworld when their wrath is aimed against the walls of the gardh, but also the strength which makes Thorrso powerful against his woe- working likes.Thurisaz is the rune of aimed might, melding, as is the nature of the thursar, the brute force of firewith the brute being of ice to create a violent but guidable reaction. At best, this is the striking of the ironhammer Mjollnir aimed outward to ward; at its worst, it is the mighty fists of thethursarbeating in thewalls of the world.As a phallic rune, thurisaz has both the woe-working powers written forth in the rune poems andthe weal-working power to break barrenness and bring fruitfulness. You must remember that Thorr is agod of the crops as well as a warder, as his being is shown forth in the Summer thunderstorms which keepthe grain alive.

Freyr, the lord of fruitfulness, has fallen in love with Gerdhr the giant maiden who embodiesthe frozen winter earth. Her name is derived from gardhr, enclosure, indicating the barriers of coldnessand unwillingness which ward her womb. Neither love, nor riches, nor the threat of death can move her;only when Freyr’s messenger (hypostasis?)

It is the main stave used for purpose ofrevenge and harm-mighty warding and is useful in battles of both wizardry and weapons, as written forthin the Havamal.As a rune of warding, it is best set to strike back to another’s thrust.In the personal sphere,thurisaz may be used to prick your will awake and to strenghthen and aim your use of force. In certainbindings it aids in bringing on the rage of the berserker, which, however, is seldom a good thing in anysetting less than open war and not always then. Used carefully, it may break down the barriers of a closedmind and bring the lightning-stroke of new thought. An understanding of the way in which thurisaz meldsopposites into a single point of might bursting forth will make this rune a great source of power for theskilled vitki; for the novice, it is something to approach with caution. The skilled vitki will also find thisrune helpful in overcoming blockages of both the soul and the body, especially in certain forms of fertilitymagic where hindrances are met with.Used with other runes, thurisaz is a worthy warder aimer, and awakener. A common method ofenchanting a person in Germanic tradition is to prick that person with a thorn, the AngloSaxon name forthurisaz, easily seen in the shape of the stave. Odhinn puts the valkyrja Sigrdrifa to sleep by pricking herwith a “sleep-thorn”-an enchanted thorn, perhaps with runes carved on it, the powers of which thethurisaz-shape of the thorn would guide into her and prick into action. This thought has survived in thenumerous Germanic children’s stories in which the prick of a thorn, pin, or spindle casts a charm upon itsvictim. In the tales of Sigrdrifa and Sleeping Beauty, the thorn of awakening is the phallus of the herowho wakes the enchanted maiden, the act of sex being discreetly symbolized in later versions by a kiss.Thurisaz can be used in the raising and guiding of thunderstorms, either as a ward against the wrathof the storm, or in aiming the lightning, if you must, though this would not be wisdom’s rede.All in all, working with thurisaz is like picking up a thorny branch barehanded. If you are carefuland skilled, you can use it well; if not, you can do yourself much harm.Agate is associated with the warding side of thurisaz. TheAnglo-Saxons used this stone to guardagainst thunder, demons (thurses), witchcraft, and the venom of snakes, all of which Thorr is mightyagainst. Bloodstone is fitting for this stave, having been a traditional ingredient in the raising ofthunderstorms. It gives its wearer strength and courage in battle. The iron oxide hematite can be usedwell with thurisaz, being a tattle-help like bloodstone.

It may be worthwhileto meditate on this in conjunction with the forth-rushing nature of thurisaz.Thurisaz: MeditationYou stand on the side of a rocky mountain, near a glacier of black ice. The earth around you iscovered with jagged gray boulders. Nothing grows here except thistles and tangles of thorn bushes. Theground is hard and icy beneath your boots; the sky above you is heavy and dark.The mountain begins to shake beneath you, grinding as it moves. The rumbling earth knocks youdown. You fall painfully among the sharp rocks. Suddenly a spurt of fire bursts through the center of theglacier. The brilliant flash of light and the deafening thunderclap strike you together. As you blink youreyes clear of the searing brightness, you see the glacier slowly raising itself from the mountain in theshape of a huge, manlike wight whose skin is the gray of stone or iron. He raises a great club and roars atyou wordlessly, striding towards you with heavy steps that rattle the rocks. You scramble to your feet andrun farther up the mountain, never more than a few steps from the stone-shattering blows of his mightyweapon.Fleeing blindly, you run into an impassable barrier of thorns that snag your skin and hold you fast.Desperate, you pluck one of the thorns and fling it at the massive club descending towards your head. Thethorn flies straight and true, striking the thurse’s weapon and shattering it to bits. He roars in anguish andrushes towards you as you throw a second thorn at him. This thorn hits him with a flash like lightning andhis body bursts asunder. Great chunks of stone and shards of red-hot iron fly through the air, but thethorns about you smash them to dust before they can harm you.Plucking a third thorn, you hurl it into the heavy, dark clouds above you. Its lightning flash isanswered by the rumbling of great chariot wheels through the sky and the sound of a man’s deep laughtermingling with the thunder. The heavy chariot bursts through the low clouds, drawn by two wild-eyedgoats with sparks flashing from their hooves and champing teeth. In the chariot you see a burly, muscularman with fiery red hair and beard, swinging a great iron hammer around his head in an iron-gloved hand.Thorr raises his hammer in a salute and grins at you, then flings the weapon down to strike the frozenground below with a terrible rending crash. Looking down from the mountain, you can see the furrowedcracks in the icy earth. The hammer returns to Thorr’s hand and he throws it again, shattering the stonesbelow to dust. Re cracks his whip and the goats turn and gallop up into the sky. Thorr’s third throwbreaks the dark bellies of the clouds into jagged cracks of lightning, striking the ground as a torrential rainpours down from the sky.The storm is blindingly intense, but soon over.

Fetters spring from my feet, and bonds from my hands.— Havamal 149Ansuz is the rune by which the first of Odhinn’s powers and root of his being are manifested. Therune-name means “god”; the Anglo-Saxon form is “mouth,” showing the side of Odhinn’s being which islord of poetry and keeper of Odhroerir, the mead of inspiration. Ansuz is a stave of opening in every way,as described in the Havamal (above). Ansuz opens the subconscious to receive and transmit artisticinspiration; it opens all lines of communication, earthly and magical alike, and releases locks andblockages of energy. This stave embodies the soft and cunning passing of air, as opposed to the forciblepiercing of thurisazOdhinn’s wit instead of Thor’s strength.As the rune of air, an element which blends both manly and womanly qualities, it shows Odhinn’sendless power of changing to fit the world around him and disguising himself as needed, as well as hishermaphroditic nature. It also shows his endless, restless wandering in search of new knowledge and hiswork of learning, integrating new wisdom, and teaching it in turn to those who can understand it.Ansuz is the rune which rules the power of galdr-magic: the might of the spoken and chanted wordand of the breath of life which Odhinn breathed into Askr (ash) and Embla (elm), the first humans. This32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"breath,ond,is the actual spirit, analogous to the Hebrewruachwhich means both “soul” and “breath.” AsLord of the Winds, Odhinn is himself the embodiment of this idea of “spirit” and of all the magical mightwithin, as his title Galdrfadhir, “father of magical songs,” shows. The highest mastery of the magicalbreath is, of course, the magical song which melds the ecstasy of poetic inspiration with the guidance ofpower. In the shaper’s trance, one has reached a state in which one can receive the truths of the hiddenthoughts of the world (collective unconscious, also implied by the nature of Mimir’s Well) and transmutethem into forms which show their might in the deepest layers of the hearers’ minds. This is the gift ofOdhinn through the rune ansuz, the gift of the mead Odhroerir, one of the three great roots of Odhinn’smight.As well as embodying Odhinn’s powers of inspiration and thought, the rune ansuz also shows theside of Odhinn’s being which is the Lord of the Wild Hunt, leader of the dead. As the passing soul isoften felt as a breath of wind, the ancient Germanic people also sensed the nearness of restless ghosts inthe stormy autumn and winter nights, knowing the fury(wodh)from which this god takes his name in therage of the wild winds. It is thought by most that this is Odhinn’s oldest shape: leader of the horde ofrushing ghosts and embodiment of the might of madness which is shown through his followers as bothpoetic inspiration and berserker rage. The rune ansuz is the rune of Odhinn as the lord of life and deathalike: of wrath, wisdom, and mighty words; of the godly melding of greatness and madness. The rune ansuz is used for creative inspiration and reception of Odhinn’s might. As a rune which workson the deepest layers of the mind, it brings the ability for magnetic, even hypnotic speech-a power whichcan be used for weal and woe alike. The most extreme example of this can be seen in the oratoricaltrances of Adolf Hitler, who seemed to have tapped into this might unknowingly and used it to mesmerizea great part of his nation. (For the interested, H.G. Baynes’ contemporary study,Germany Possessed,goes into this instance of archetypal/ mythological breakthrough in great detail.)Ansuz unblocks the channels of self-expression; it can be used to overcome the blockages of bodyand mind caused by fear or trauma and to deal with bindings and restraints of every kind. Through meditation on ansuz and the side of Odhinn’s being which is the Lord of Death, you cancome to a fuller understanding of death and thereby overcome the terrors it holds.Ansuz is used in all forms of receptive psychic ability and magic. It ought to be called into thevitki’s own sphere before any act of galdr-magic.Should you be trusting or fool enough to lend your body to a spirit-being, ansuz could be used forchanneling. This is not, however, a wise thing to do at all, as most of the walkers between the worlds areno more trustworthy than the average human stranger and frequently less so.A good stone to use with ansuz is lapis lazuli, which has traditionally been seen as a link betweenthe human and the godly. The name “lazuli” is derived from the Arabic word for “heaven”-fitting for arune so close to the lord of wind and sky. Lapis is said to be a mental and spiritual opener, aiding one inreceiving both the messages of the hidden mind and the inspiration of the gods.Ansuz: MeditationYou stand in the center of a barren plain.

Desperately as you pursue Odhinn, youfall farther and farther behind him until at last he follows the twisting path into the shadow of the pinesand you can see him no more.The harsh wind spatters raindrops across your face as the storm clouds shut out the last fadinglight. You hear the storm rushing through the treetops like a great river, moaning and howling through thepines.

You walk more swiftly, keeping your head low.Over your head, a wind-tossed branch breaks. Glancing up, you see a train of dark shapes againstthe blackened sky-cloudy men on horses and their red-eyed dogs running before them and the cloakedfigure on an eight-legged steed who leads the Wild Hunt. His arm reaches out, one finger pointed straightat you, and you feel a shaft of ice pierce your heart.You begin to run again, fleeing in terror before the dark horde of ghosts. You twist and turn amongthe pines, but the Hunt is gaining on you. The cold breath of the dogs is on your back when your footcatches in the writhing root of a tree, and you fall to the wet earth. As the Wild Hunt sweeps down toclaim you, you raise the flyspecked crimson toadstool to your mouth and take a bite out of it. A greatrushing of wind fills your skull, bearing you aloft. You shout in furious ecstasy with the wild excitementof the wind that you ride behind Odhinn, and the other ghosts howl in answer around you.The dark madness of the Hunt possesses you wholly as you fly screaming down the wind, over theblack-needled treetops.You have no sense of how long you ride but in time the wind slows and the gray light of dawn risesaround you. You fare alone with Odhinn again. He turns and looks at you. His dark blue hood shadowshis features, but you feel that he is smiling as he begins to chant:“Well have you riddenIwon wisdom-reward / Galdrfadhir’s gift the magical mead,ISongs beyour strengthIwords your bright weapons,IFor galdrrnight’s masteryIdrink now of Odhroerir!”Odhinn hands you a horn of mead. You raise it and drink it off in one mighty draught, your head spinningwith the sweet drunkenness of the poetry you can feel whirling up from the depths of your soul.When you look up, Odhinn has gone, but the wild ecstasy of his nearness still roars from his giftwithin you.

If a foe shoots a shaft into the host, it cannot fly so fast that I can not stop it, if I catch sight of it.— Havamal 150The name of this rune has been interpreted variously as wagon,chariot,” and “riding.” It is closely tied tothe ancient Indo-European images of a horse-drawn wagon or chariot carrying the sun, and also to thepractice of burying the dead with horses, wagons, and/or ships. As a solar rune, raidho writes forth thecycle of the day, thesolarhiringar(ring of the sun). This ring was divided into an eight-spoked wheelmatching the eight points of the compass and determined equally by the passage of the sun (midday,midnight, etc.) and by the daily rhythm of social life (hours of rising and going to bed, mealtimes,etc.).[1] When solar measurements rule social rhythms, time is always seen as a relative phenomenon.The legal measurement of time written forth as the hour in which the sun stands just over the shaft of anupward-pointing spear will point out a different “objective” time at different places and seasons, but itwill always be the same in relationship to the actual length of the hours of daylight. Raidho is not a runeof absolute measurement but of proportionate and appropriate relationships.Above all, raidho is a rune of ordered movement-movement in space, movement in time, and therelationship between the two.35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Norse concepts of direction and distance were not based on objective points, but on themovement of people between points. Space was measured in terms of motion and time: the main unit ofdistance was the length of a day’s faring on horseback, which might vary wildly in absolute termsaccording to the soft of land one crossed but which in fact precisely indicated the spaceltime needs ofone’s faring.[2] Raidho rules the rhythms of movement in all ways, melding the temporal and spatial withthe personal needs of action.As the rune of measurement of time and space, raidho is also the rune of social boundaries asreckoned by the movement of the calendar and physical location in regard to other individuals orcommunities. The chief events of the Norse calendar were the three Things taking place in the summerhalf of the year, which was thought of as the best time for dealing out justice and making the greatestsocial decisions. The Althing, the greatest gathering of justice and government was also the center of eachyear’s time-reckoning. It was in the course of this gathering that the calendar for each year wasdetermined and spoken forth. Legal boundaries were, like boundaries of measurement, determined bymotion rather than objective space: a man using another man’s horse or boat without permission had notcommitted a major crime until he had passed three farms or more in a given direction; a court ofbanishment had to be held “within a bowshot” of the fence around the lands of the accused man.[3]As the rune of rhythm and faring, raidho maybe felt in the beating of the drum or singing whichcarries thespakona(female shaman/prophet) orspamadhr(male shaman/prophet) on the vision- quest.The “horse” of the rune poem is both the fylgja or fetch, which is spoken of further under ehwaz, and therhythm of the faring itself, which, if you are acting rightly, will bear you along on its own. Raidho is alsothe rune of the final faring, the faring of death or rebirth in the manner of the sun’s course.In the personal sphere, raidho makes you aware of both the rhythms of the natural world and theright times for ritual and social action as they fit with the turnings of nature (separation between these notexisting in the Germanic world-view). The line in the Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme, “Reginn forged thebest sword,” shows the power of awareness of the right time and setting: the shards of Sigmundr’s swordcould only be forged into a weapon of true might when the hour of Sigurdhr’s first great deed had come.Raidho can also be used to bring you the wisdom to pace your efforts so as to be sure of finishing yourtask.Raidho is used to bring about justice and harmony as relative things within a society; it is the runeof judgment according to perspective and mitigating or incriminating circumstances. Raidho is the soul ofthe law, as tiwaz is the letter of the law. It also works in melding the individual with the folk within thenormal bonds of society.In ritual work, raidho rules ritual forms, gestures and movements, especially circle-walking and theuse of music, dance, knocking, and number. It should be used together with ansuz in writing or readyingfor a ritual and in creative work when rhythm and proportion are needed.Raidho can be used to ward you while traveling in the realms of either spirit or earth; it may beinscribed on your vehicle to keep the faring smooth and swift. Raidho controls movement of all sorts, asdescribed in the Havamal. It can be used to aid your aim.A stone to use with raidho is turquoise, a traditional warder of travelers and also traditionally usedto improve marksmanship. Jacinth may also be used with this rune; it, too, is a warder of travelers and itrelates to the social order of raidho by supposedly ensuring that the wayfarer will always be treated withfitting hospitality.Raidho: MeditationYou sit silently with your eyes closed. Around you, you hear a soft, rhythmic thumping. At firstyou think it is the beating of your heart, but as it grows louder and clearer you can tell that it is the regularpounding of a drum. The sound grows louder and louder, drawing all your thought into it. When you openyour eyes, you see that the drumbeat is actually the pounding of a horse’s hooves and you yourself areriding the horse, a beautiful chestnut. Looking down, you see that it has eight legs, although it is wellproportioned and the beating of its hooves against the dirt road is perfectly regular.The land you are riding through is mountainous and rocky, silent in the cold gray light of dawn.The sun rises as you ride, moving at the same pace as your steed, so that its place in the sky is never any36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"farther or nearer to you.

A crisp breeze is blowing off the ocean, stirring up the waves. You can see asmall boat keeping pace with you over the water, rising and falling in a measured pattern. Circling upfrom the shore, you ride past rich and fruitful fields. The wheat is high and just beginning td ripen, greentinged with gold. As you turn towards the western coast, you see the farmers going in for their middaymeal. A cool, damp breeze blows from the sea ahead of you; the little boat is rounding the curve of theland, still keeping pace with you and the sun.As you ride up towards the northwest the land begins to become rockier again. You can hear thingsslithering and moving be- hind the boulders, and every so often a dark tail or paw whisks swiftly into ahole, but none of the hidden creatures dare to come near the road.A cold, sharp wind cuts through the lingering warmth of summer as you ride. The day is beginningto darken as the sun sinks and the farmers go in for their evening meal. You are beginning to grow tired,but the pounding rhythm of the horse’s hooves beneath you strengthens you and carries you onward.A wolf’s howl rises from the mountains around you, answered by another and another. Severalgray shapes slip out of the rocks behind you. The wolves follow you along the sides of the road, waitingfor your horse to miss a step. Past the wolves are other things, murky black shadows waiting andwhispering. Their voices get louder, calling your name. You hear the voices of your parents and of friendsfrom the past in the darkness, begging you to turn aside. Staring down at the faintly glimmering pathbefore you, you guide your horse along without turning or breaking the rhythm of its hooves.Clawed hands reach out along the side of the road as if to drag you down. You see glowing greeneyes in twisted faces and foxfire glinting off shark-sharp teeth as the thousands of nameless dwellers inthe dark howl and yammer around you. You know that to turn from the road or break the rhythm of yourriding is to be lost forever among this horde of dark things. Over and over you chant the name of theroad-rune to ward yourself:raidho, raidho, raidho.Ahead of you, you can see a faint gleaming; your roadhas brought you spiraling upward into the air, so that the jagged dark peaks are shadows in the night farbelow you. The creatures following you begin to drop back as you draw nearer to the source of the light.At first you think that you are coming towards the sun; but as you get near enough to see through thegolden gleaming, you see that it is a silver-roofed hall upheld by glowing pillars of gold from which thelight and summery warmth radiate. The walls are open. Within you see a fair-featured man with goldenhair and beard, seated on a raised throne before a clear spring of water. He holds an oaken staff in onehand, beckoning to you with it. He does not speak as you come before him, but dips up some of the waterin his free palm and drinks of it. You do likewise, dismounting and drinking of the spring in holy silence.This man, whom you now know as Forseti, god of righteousness, smiles at you and traces the rune raidhoover your heart with the tip of his staff. He points to a second path from his hall, which leads straightdownward through the light of the sunrise. You bow in respect and thanks and mount your horse again,riding down to your body on the earth. Closing your eyes,you hear the hoofbeats of your horse soften tothe beating of a drum, until you can hear nothing but your own heart beating. You are back in your ownbody, your feet planted firmly on the earth, holding the power of raidho with Forseti’s blessing.37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"KENAZGaldr-sound: Keh-Keh-Keh (The K sound is hit hard, volume tapering down like the sound of asharply struck bell. The galdr-sound is neither prolonged like those of most of the runes nor choppedoff like that of thurisaz, but fades swiftly to a natural end.)Letter: K, hard C(Torch) is to every living person (Torch) is to every living person known by its fireit is clear and bright it usually burns when the athlings rest inside the hall.— Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem(Sore) is the curse of children Grief makes a man pale.— Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme(Sore) is the bale of children and a scourge and the house of rotten flesh.— Old Icelandic Rune PoemI know a sixth. If some thane attacks me, with the wood of a young root,he who says he hates me will get hurt, but I will be unharmed.— Havamal 151The source of the meaning behind kenaz is one of the most deeply shrouded in the runic system. Therune’s two names, “torch” and “sore, boil, or swelling,” seem utterly unrelated to each other. The answerto this seeming dichotomy may be found in the changing burial practices of the early Germanic peoples.At first a corpse was kept in an unsealed mound and left to rot until the flesh had disintegrated to the pointwhere it could easily be separated from the bones and (possibly) used in the burial rites.[1]This is the“house of rotting flesh” referred to in the Old Icelandic Rune Poem. The Anglo-Saxon poem, on the otherhand, tells of the later time when fire had largely replaced decay as a means of freeing the bones from theflesh. Both meanings of kenaz speak of the readying of the corpse for mound-burial. On the esoteric level,this readying deals with the initiation inside the mound, an initiation written forth in the image of a smithflaying the candidate to pieces and reforging his bones. The alfish smith as initiation-master is a well-known Germanic figure. Echoes of this dismemberment/initiation ritual can be seen faintly in the lay ofVolundr (Wayland) in which, however, the ritual usage is only mistily remembered among the details ofthe smith’s revenge. The initiation-by-fire is an initiation on different levels for both king and shaman, asmay be seen in outline in the Volundr tale and more clearly in the Eddic poem “Grimnismal” in whichOdhinn, tortured by fire for nine nights, chants the ritual knowledge which empowers himself and raises38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"his hearer, the young prince Agnarr, to the kingship.Kenaz governs the primal craft of the smith and all works of knowledge crafted into action. Itswork is that of cleansing followed by transformation, as the verse of theHavamalwrites forth, tellinghow the energy of a woe-working spell can be reshaped to work woe to one’s foeman and weal to oneself.Although the smith/king initiation seems to be a work of males, the workings of the mound belongto the necklace-adorned earth-goddess who was originally called Nerthus and later became Freyja,“Lady.” This goddess ruled the twin workings of death and fruitfulness, as will be spoken of later underBerkano. The rune kenaz shows the fire of Freyja’s sexuality (fehu) given shape by the wit and craft ofthe smith. This relationship is best written forth in the tale of Freyja’s buying of the necklace/girdleBrisingamen (Fire- necklace), center of much of her might. Freyja saw four dwarves forging the necklaceof gold and bought it from them at the price of four nights of her love, which is to say that she gave themthe fiery might in the form of sexual power with which they were able to bring forth the necklace to itsfinal being.Kenaz is the power of fehu controlled and used for shaping. It is the rune of unmaking for the sakeof remaking. It is used for all acts of artistic shaping, in which the vision, or fire, must break down theraw gold of the earthly material and reshape it into the vision-image set forth in earthly being. Used bythe experienced magician, kenaz is the rune which releases the spirit into the realms of power, as writtenforth in the lay of Volundr and Grimnismal.Kenaz is used for mastery over the sexual energies, often in conjunction with the other fire-runes. Itmay also be called upon for guiding emotional power to achieve a goal and to shape the feelings ofothers.Being closely tied to the inherited right of kingship and the mound in which the dead ancestorsdwell,kenaz is one of the runes useful in testing and bringing forth those powers which have passed downto you either from the ancestors of your body or from earlier lifetimes. This use is written of in the storyof Ottar, in which Freyja makes the cave-dwelling witch Hyndla tell all the names of Ottar’s line so thather lover may gain his rightful might. Kenaz is the source of the bright charisma burning like a torchwithin the true leader,[2] the rune of the king.As the rune of the fire within the mound, kenaz is also associated with the dragon orwyrm,thecoiling wight of Wyrd’s hidden workings.The woe-working side of kenaz’s being is disintegration without reintegration, or unguidedshaping, shown forth as rotting sickness or as tumors and cancer.In ritual workings, kenaz may be seen as the torch or candle which is a sign of the controlled fire ofthe vitki’s will through all the realms in which he/she is working.Used with other runes, kenaz aids the vitki in shaping their power and selecting the sides of theirbeing on which she/he wants to call.The stones associated with kenaz are flint, the primal source of human craftsmanship and masteryover fire; fire agate and fire opal which aid the control and use of sexual power and raise creativity; andsmoky quartz, also used with eihwaz.Kenaz: MeditationYou stand on the northern side of a mound at sunset, dressed in a white tunic and carrying a roundshield and longsword. At your right hand, the sky glows red and gold around the sinking sun; at your left,it is already dark. One star shines brightly from the deepening blue above you. It is the evening star, thestar of Freyja. The mound is not much taller than your head, a rounded heap of stones overgrown withthick grass.As the last rim of the red sun sinks below the horizon, a dark opening appears before you. The holein the mound is barely large enough for you to crawl into with weapon and shield held before your body.The stones lining the way are harsh and cold as death against your bare knees. At the end of the longpassage you see a glow as of red gold lit by fire. A steamlike hissing like an overheated bellows soundsaround you.As you near the end of the passage, you see that it opens out into a great round chamber, filled withall sorts of cunningly worked golden treasures: cups, bracelets glittering with rubies and emeralds,necklaces, and statuettes, each gleaming in the light of little flames which leap about them. In the middle39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of the mound is a great iron anvil and the firepit and bellows of a forge.

Wary of the wyrm’s power to enchant, you do not look straight into his gaze, but rather at theflamelike tongue flickering in and out of his razor-toothed mouth.“Who are you, and what do you seek?” the dragon asks in a voice like water hissing off moltenmetal.Knowing that you should not tell this beast your true name, you answer, “I am Child-of-Good-Kinand I seek the goddess goldbright, Brisingamen’s well-known wearer.

A great gust of fire spews from his throat, butyou duck under it and drive your sword deep into the naked place on his underside. His thrashings tear theweapon from your hand, whipping the length of his serpentine body against the stones of the chamber.You crouch down beside the anvil, trying to keep from being battered to death by the death throes of thedragon.When only a few shudders run down the length of the wyrm’s corpse, you pull your sword out andcut his heart out of his body, burning blood welling up over your hands as you pull the dark, throbbingpiece of dragon-flesh forth. Spitting the heart on your sword, you roast it over the fire of the forge, dropsof blood sizzling onto the flames. The first bite of meat burns your tongue, but you know that you musteat it all.

As he movesaround you, you can see that he has been hamstrung. His face is horribly scarred with burn marks and hisragged, scorch-holed tunic is smeared all over with black soot. His arms are hugely muscled, but hisgnarled fingers are delicate as he picks your bones up and lays them upon the forge. One by one, he heatsthe bones of your body until they glow like iron, then smiths them back together. You feel each batteringblow, each touch of fire and blast of the bellows, but in spite of the intensity of these sensations, there isno pain. As the smith strikes you again and again with his great hammer, he stands straighter andbecomes more and more comely, the burns and smears of coal on his face vanishing, his back untwistingand his legs healing, until he stands before you in a fine white tunic as a handsome alf with long blondhair, clear gray eyes, fair skin and noble features.“Hail to thee, Child-of-Good-Kin!” the smith says, and puts a heavy gold crown into your hands.This crown is worked into the image of a boar’s head with eyes of glowing fire opal golden snout open,and tusks set for battle.The smith leaps into the air and is gone. You get off the forge and stand, feeling new strength rushinto you as you look towards the southern side of the mound.A tall woman appears before you, red-gold hair curling thickly down her back, her arms spread outto embrace you. She is slender but her hips flare sweetly and her breasts are large and full. Her face isbreathtakingly beautiful.

To the Germanic people, the actof giving was a highly meaningful one, the process of exchange also being a binding of loyalty. Acommonkenningfor a lord was “ring-giver” speaking of the duty of a lord to give freely of his wealth tohis followers. By accepting a gift, one pledged one’s trueness. It was, indeed, thought of as shameful for aman to live past a battle in which his ring-giver was slain. The breaking of this holy bond is alwaysfollowed by disaster, as shown by the end of Beowulf, in which the hero’s death is caused by thecowardice of his men, who abandon him in his fight against the dragon. Widsith, the only man whoremained faithful, reproaches the others with the gifts which were the outward sign of the bindingbetween themselves and the lord. Hjalti’s speech in the Bjarkimal shows the same understanding: In foul winds as in fair, keep faith with your lord, he who withheld no hoard for himself but gave us freely of gold and silver. Strike with the swords he bestowed, and the spears in helmets and hauberks you got from his hand let shine the shields that he shared with you thus honestly earning the wealth he gave.1Gebo also relates to the practice of sealing alliances between clans by either marriage or anexchange of hostages, usually the sons of the lords who would then be fostered by the families of theirearher foes and slain if treachery took place. This is the reason for the presence of Freyr and Njord amongthe Aesir, they being the hostages who ended the war between the Aesir and the Vanir, their Aesiccounterparts being Hoenir and Mimir. This understanding of loyalty-through-exchange works on everylevel, as described in the Havamal:Friends should share joy in weapons and clothes that are evident to one another. Those who share gifts stay the fastest friends, 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"when things go well. A man shall ever be a friend to his friends, and give gift for gift, laughter for laughter, but give lies for lies... He who gives gladly lives the best life and seldom has sorrow, but the unwise suspect all and always pine for gifts.2Generosity in every wise is one of the chief Teutonic virtues, whether it is expressed as gifts, ashospitality, or as the blessing of sacrifice. The ability to give freely is the only way to gain, not only theloyalty created by the act of giving but also the hamingja-might which comes from right action. The strictTeutonic code of hospitality is grounded on this understanding, as spoken of in the runepoem. Thehomeless wanderer relies on this code for the food and shelter which, in the icy northern lands, oftenmeant the difference between life and death, while the host gains the weal of working rightly as well asthe growth of his/her good reputation.The setting of Grimnismal writes forth the workings of gebo. Odhinn has gone to settle a wagerwith Frigga by seeing whether it is true that King Geirrodhr is stingy towards his guests; Frigga warns theking of the approach of an ill-meaning wizard and he thus questions Odhinn, who refuses to talk, thenstrings him up over a fire. Finally Geirrodhr’s son Agnarr brings Odhinn a horn of beer, to which giftOdhinn replies, “Eight nights I sat between the fires. / No man dealt me food, except for Agnarr alone, /the son of Geirroth / he alone shall rule the land of the Goths. / Hail, Agnan! Veratyr bids you greetings. /You will never get / better payment for a single drink. “[3]Odhinn’s gift to Agnarr is the chanting of mystic wisdom, which, as described in the king/shamaninitiation of kenaz, raises the subject to the kingship and frees the worker. Odhinn ends by turning thewoe-working power of gebo on King Geirrodhr, returning woe for woe by causing him to stumble and dieon his own sword, paying Geirrodhr back and bringing Agnarr to his inheritance.Gebo governs both the religious work of sacrificing to the gods and the mystical work ofsacrificing self to self, as Odhinn does endlessly in his search for wisdom. In Teutonic thought sacrifice ismore than simple supplication or payment for favors; rather, it is the binding of loyal love which shapesthe relationships between individual heroes and their gods. This can be seen with special clearness in thecase of Odhinnic heroes: either Odhinn comes against his hero to claim him in his final battle, or thedying warrior must have himself marked with the point of a spear to show that he is himself a gift toOdhinn. In return for the gifts of victory which Odhinn gave them in life, his heroes become members ofhis troops of einherjar who will fight beside him at Ragnarok.The runic section of the Havamal contains several references to sacrifice, the most notable beingOdhinn’s telling of his ordeal on Yggdrasil. I know that I hung on a wind-swept tree all of nine nights wounded by spear, and given to Odhinn myself to myself. [4]It is better not to ask, than to sacrifice too much. A gift always looks for a gift.[5]Odhinn’s sacrifice on Yggdrasill and his giving of his eye for a drink from Mimir’s welldemonstrate the sacrifice of self to self which the vitki must always be making. This is one of the roots ofthe death-initiation: you must always be ready to sacrifice your current ideas and state of awareness andbeing for the sake of reaching a greater wisdom. Every act demands a payment of some sort; you cannotgain without experiencing loss.Gebo represents the endless exchange of energies through which all comes into being. In this42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"aspect, it is the rune of sexual magic and the “alchemical marriage” in which each of the singlecomponents is sacrificed for the sake of creating something transcendent ( see Dagaz).Gebo is used in all cases of equal exchanges of energies, especially those in which a binding iswished. The power of gebo brings friendship, loyalty, and hospitality.In workings of woe, gebo may be used to bind someone to an unwanted obligation or to return woefor woe.Gebo is the rune most often used in ‘love magic.” Properly used, it creates an awareness of the self-sacrificial and balanced nature of love between two people.In ritual, gebo represents the payments which must always be made: the gift of energy or foodmade to a plant before cutting it; the blood and life of the vitki which give life to the runes; and the meador ale poured over the altar to the gods.The initiatory value of gebo is that of Nietzsche’s “going under”-giving up all that you are for thesake of becoming something higher, as Odhinn did on Yggdrasill. When the Christian trappings havebeen stripped away, you may see the workings of gebo in the Parzival story.Gebo works as a moderator with other runes, especially fehu, the force of which it binds and guidesfor a balanced weal, warding off the woe that comes when fehu is blocked or misguided.The stones associated with gebo are emerald, which is a traditional emblem of love and loyalty,and jade, which is said to open you to an awareness of the need and fitting times for sacrifice to seal yourrelationships with the gods and other wights.Gebo: MeditationYou sit at the head of a long wooden table inside a great hall. The polished wooden seat is hard andsmooth under you; the air is cold with winter and rich with the smells of bread and roasting pork. Long-haired, bearded warriors line the benches along the tables, talking and laughing. You know that this isyour hall-you have provided the great roasts of meat that weigh down the table and the mead that flows inceaseless streams from the pitchers of the serving maids into the drinking horns of your followers.Nevertheless, there is a certain chill to the hall, and you see several men pulling their cloaks about themand glancing at you uneasily. You yourself are beginning to become uncomfortably warm, as if a fireburned just beside you. The heat, you find, is radiating out from a large bag by your side.Standing, you pick the bag up. It is very heavy, so heavy that your arms ache after holding it for afew moments. Slowly you begin to walk down one side of the table, stopping before each warrior andtaking a heavy gold ring or bracelet out of the bag to give him. Receiving the gift, each warrior draws hissword or axe and turns the hilt for you to touch as a sighn of his trueness to you. As you keep walkingdown one side and up the other, the hall becomes warmer and the unnatural heat fades from your bag oftreasure. Your enlivened men cheer and toast you as you pass, returning to their feasting with redoubledvigour, fingers and arms weighted with your gold.When you have gifted your last man and received histroth, you return to your place at the head of the table.A knock sounds hollow against the far door and oneof your warriors gets up to open it.At the door is an old man in a dark and tattered cloak, soaked through and dishevelled by the highnight winds.One of his eyes is a frightful ruin of scar tissue, and his grey beard cannot hide the livid scarsofrope burns on his throat.Your warrior is about to push this old beggar away roughly, but you alwaysmindful of the laws of hispitiality, command him to let the old man in.With yout own handsyou bring theunexpected guest a heaping plate of meat, bread, and cheese and a large horn of your best mead, making aplace for him in the seat of honor at your right hand. He eats and drinks with an amazingly hearty appetitefor such an old man, but there is always plenty of food and drink for everyone in your hall.The time has come for you to make sacrifices to the gods.Behind your seat is a harrow of heapedstones, glassy from the many fires that have been lit by you and your ancestors. On the harrow leis thegreat gold ring of oath-taking, the hammer used for hallowing the sacrifice, a cold-glittering sax, a stonebowl, and a dark-needled pine twigg.Two of your men lead the sacrifice. A great bull with a glossyflawless white hide, through the hall and up to the harrow.The old man watches you carefully, his onedark eye bright, as you swing the heavy hammer over the bull’s head, chanting,”Holy thou art /gift gladlygiven / to the gods for good given us/ and good that shall be”. The handle of the sax-knife is cold and43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"smooth in your hand as youlift it and, with one quick, strong motion, slice through the bull’s throat.A riveof hot dark blood spills out over the harrow and the floor.The light of life dims in the bull’s dark browneyes and he falls with a crash that shakes the timbers of the hall. You lift the bowls of warm blood and thetwigg, dipping the needles into the bowl and sprinkling the eight directions of the winds, splattering warmdroplets of blessing over the feasters and the walls. This done, you pour the blood onto the harrow. It runsand pools in the hollows ofthe glassy stone. The torchlight glints off it darkly, holding your gaze.When you look up, you see that you are outside in the gray light of twilight. The blood-filledhollow in the altar has deepened to become a stone well. The old man stands on the other side, smilingslightly at you. Despite his gray hairs and scars, there is nothing decrepit about him now; he standsstraight and tall, his dark blue cloak billowing about him.“Well you know how to give to others, and are gifted again with good. Can’st sacrifice self toself?” Odhinn asks. A shudder of cold fear runs through you, but you look the god straight in his singleeye.“I can,” you answer. “I will.”Odhinn points to the well. “There is the harrow and bowl.”Looking down into the dark water that half-fills the well, you see what seems to be the shape of therune gebo, but it is only two crossed lines of black against the darkness, not yet filled with the power oflife. When you glance up again, Odhinn is gone. A short spear leans against the well where he wasstanding. You pick it up and test the edge of the head with your thumb. It is exceedingly sharp, the baresttouch leaving a thin line of blood behind.You lean over the well, setting the spear to one side of your throat. Before you can flinch or turnback, you pull it through in one quick slash, the blade so keen that you feel only a breath of icy coldthrough your neck. The blood gushes out more slowly than you would have thought. As it touches therune gebo the stave begins to glow brilliantly red through the gloom of twilight deepening to night.

The rune geboshines bright before you on the surface of the full well and you stand, entirely whole, although when youput your hand up to your throat you can still feel the ridge of the scar.You return to your own body, feet firmly planted on the earth, knowing that the power to give andreceive, the might of gebo, will always be within you.44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"WUNJOGaldr-sound: wwwwwwwww (a deep buzzing w, rather like a U with lips almost closed)Letter: W, V(Joy) is had by the one who knows few troubles pain and sorrows and who to himself has blessedness and bliss and stronghold enough.— Anglo-Saxon Rune PoemThe rune wunjo, “joy,” rules the virtue of cheerfulness, which is as necessary to the Teutonic heroas strength or generosity. A cheerful mind through all hardship was seen as a great part of courage, asSigurdhr, the greatest of Teutonic heroes, tells:Ever the fearless, but the fearful never will fare well in a fight. To be glad is better than of gloomy mood whether all fall fair or foul.[1]This gladness showed forth the strength of will to endure all the sorrows and hardships of a timemuch more beset with bodily struggles and threats than our own. For the vitki, it is a sign of the ability tomaintain her/his enthusiasm for the work in spite of all the disappointments, discouragements, and strifewithin that come in the process of learning magic. Wunjo is the first rune of the will itself, as well as therune of a balanced, integrated personality. To reach the goal of wunjo, you must be able to keep yourpains and sorrows from looming too large in your life, yet you must know a few troubles in order tounderstand how to deal with problems when they do arise.The last line of the rune poem is especially meaningful, when seen in the setting of Germanicthinking in general and Anglo-Saxon thinking in particular, in which the world-view seems to begloomier than that of most of the Germanic peoples. The only place where you may find happiness andfellowship is the stronghold orbyrgof the rune poem. An ordinary person without “stronghold enough” isdoomed to sorrow, as the poem “The Wanderer” tells in such wrenching words. Life itself, even in theChristian writings of Bede, is compared to a sparrow which swoops from the dark unknown into one doorof the hall, bides for a little while in the warmth and light, and flies out again into the stormy blackness.Being within the stronghold means both warding against sorrow and experiencing the joy of being withyour kin and friends-the only cure for the loneliness which was such suffering for the outcast. Wunjo isthe rune of fellowship and the bindings of kin, as distinct from the “social contract” of gebo.For the vitki, wunjo is the rune which melds the different sides of your own being into a whole,relieving tension and binding the sides of the self together as the kinsmen in the hall are bound. Thereference to “fortress enough” hints that the vitki is never truly set apart from his/her base of power but isable to keep the unwavering brightness of outlook which is her/his strength through all trials, becausethere is no weak spot in him/her which would be in danger of crumbling under stress.45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Wunjo is used to battle all kinds of despair and sorrow which weaken the soul, especially whenthese stem from magical struggle. It is particularly useful in cases when emotional healing is needed, as itboth strengthens and balances the self.Wunjo is a good rune to use in healing rifts between people, especially between family members,and to unite varying groups of people. It is more powerful if a common threat or goal exists; it raisesawareness of similarities and lowers the uneasiness that comes with unfamiliarity between people.In the personal sphere, wunjo aids the twinned powers of courage and cheerfulness and helps self-confidence, bettering the self- image and giving the person a strong standpoint from which to relate to theworld. It can also be used to make yourself pleasant and generally beloved.The woe-working sides of wunjo’s being are its capabilities to cause overconfidence, complacency,or trust and affection towards an unworthy wight. It can dim awareness of the meaning of problems andlower alertness. The powers that enable this rune to deal with despair also enable it to lull wariness andsuspicion; it can attract someone to a person or goal which will work woe to him/her. Wunjo is a goodrune if you are a leader of some sort, but the power a beloved leader has over her/his followers can easilywork either for weal or woe. Also, magically binding someone to yourself should be thought of as puttingthat person into a kind of slavery, which without good cause is a work against all right.The being of the rune wunjo is shown forth on one level of the story of Baldr. Frigga gains theoaths of everything (except the little mistletoe) in the Nine Worlds that they will not harm Baldr, bringinghim into their clan, as it were. This warding leads the gods to merrily toss weapons at him, a game whichgives Loki his chance to put an arrow of mistletoe into the hands of the blind Hod and thus slay Baldr.Wunjo is good in physical healing because it melds its healing of the mind and heart with theability to bind the recovery of the mind with the recovery of the body. It works best in warding againstcontagious disease by strengthening the immune system on all levels.Ritually wunjo rules the use of scents, which work as a vibrational key to harmonize all aspects ofthe working, both recel (incense) smoke and the use of oils, which both ward and strengthen the vitki. Ittends to be more a passive than an active harmonizer (considered against thurisaz, say), and most usefulin creating a charged atmosphere or bind-runes for a taufr meant to have a long- term effect.The best stones to use with wunjo are topaz, a traditional bringer of joy and warder againstmadness and sorrow, and rose quartz, which is said to open the heart and raise your sense of self-worthand ability to love. The newly found stone kunzite has also been proved to work well with this rune.Wunjo: MeditationYou stand outside a great wooden hall in the night. An icy wind cuts through your cloak and tunic,blowing sleet and freezing rain into your face. You are lonely and miserable, the crushing of despairalmost a physical weight upon you. Slowly, hopelessly, you raise your hand, knocking on the door.The heavy oaken door opens, showing you a sight of light and warmth. Your mother embraces youand draws you inside, closing the door behind you. Her hug drives the cold from your bones and loosesyour heavy mood, filling you instead with a feeling of wellbeing and comfort. All your family sits insidethe hall talking and feasting cheerfully. Your mother gives you a horn of mead, which glows warmly inyour belly as you move among your kin, greeting them with joy.After a time, you know that you must leave again. You pass silently out the other end of the hallinto the cold and freezing rain of the night. Although the cold is a sudden shock to you after the warmthof the hall, the wind does not bite as deeply as it did before, nor does the night seem quite as dark.Looking down at yourself, you see that you are glowing faintly with a golden radiance, as though youcarried the light of the hall within yourself. Heartened for the next steps of your faring, you walk alongbriskly, even whistling to yourself a little.The storm clouds are beginning to break up. A shaft of cold moonlight shines down onto the road,lighting up the dark figure that stands directly in your path. You see that it is a man in chain mail, tall andstrong. Beneath the plain steel cap on his head, you can see that his features are harsh and narrow, sharplyangled and etched with deep lines of sorrow. His skin is grayish, like pale stone, and his eyes are the coldblack of dead iron. He raises a sword in one iron-gloved hand.“Stop,” he says. “Turn back. There is no hope for you on this path. This is the land of the dead, the46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"kingdom of dust, and none stay here who have not given themselves up to cold and ice and sadness.

You fight, blades clashing harshly in the chilly moonlight. The warrior ofsorrow beats you back and back. Ice seems to flow through you, weighting your heart and your limbswith a sadness that saps your strength.You wonder if it is worth it to fight, but you remember how the light within you warded you from thecold night. Yqu force yourself to smile, then to laugh raggedly through your harsh breathing as you fight,and your strength comes back to you. Golden light shines brightly around you as you push the warrior ofsorrow back to the place on the path where you met him, then beat his blade aside and whip your ownaround and into his throat. He falls, silently, his body flowing into a gray and icy mist. You begin to walk.It is not long before the warriorbefore you again. “Stop,” he says. “Turn back.” Knowing now that youcan beat him, you leap at him before he can finish his words, thrusting your sword straight through hischain mail and into his heart. You go along the path, walking easily through the mist which does no morethan chill your calves and feet for a moment, like a sudden pool of icy water. The third time he appears,looming darkly over your path, you walk straight through him, feeling no more than a shudder. You stridealong boldly, cheerful in your knowledge that you can beat back any of the fears held by this country ofsadness.It is not long before the sun rises on a very different land. The gently rolling hills are green andlush, starred with the little white flowers of wild strawberries. As you come over one hill, you hearlaughter and cries. Walking downward, you see a fair young man who shines with a golden light standingin the center of a circle of fallen arrows, knives, spears, and rocks, his head thrown back in laughter. Thenoble men and women around him are tossing a great assortment of weapons at him, but as each onetouches his light it falls harmlessly to the earth.A tall, beautiful woman in a dark blue dress adorned with rippling silver embroidery stands bywatching and smiling gently. Her silver-streaked black hair forms a crown of braids around her head.Although she wears no ornament of rank, you nevertheless bow in respect as you come nearer to greether. You do not voice your curiosity, but you feel that her deep blue eyes look directly into your thoughts.She tells you that she is Frigg, wife of Odhinn. The shining youth is her son Baldr, who cannot bewounded because everything in the world which might possibly do him harm has sworn not to harm him,as if they were part of his own clan. Looking at the bright god, you feel a deep sense of relief at theknowledge that he, the embodiment of joy, is so warded; but you also feel a faint prickling of wariness atthe back of your neck, and wonder if it is truly wise for the enchantment to be tempted in fun.Baldr looks up to meet your eyes and raises a hand to halt the game for a moment, beckoning toyou. You go over to him and he greets you as a cousin, embracing you and tracing the rune wunjo overyour heart. A mighty wave of joy and strength fills you, and you feel the light within you brightening withhis blessing. You would like to stay with him longer, but you know that you must return to your earthlybody now. This you do, feet firmly plantedon the earth, knowing that the light of wunjo is always withinyou, strengthening your heart and will, yet never blinding you to woe.47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"HAGALAZGaldr-sound: hhhhhhhh (a powerful aspirated breath)Letter: H(Hail) is the whitest ofgrains, it comes from high in heaven showers of wind hurl it then it turns to water.Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem(Hail) is the coldest of grains Christ (Hroptr = the Hidden One = Odhinn) shaped the world in ancient times.Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme(Hail) is a cold grain, and the shower of sleet and the sickness of snakes.— Old Icelandic Rune PoemIf I see a fire high on the hall around my bench companions, I can help them by singing the spell.— Havamal 152The rune hagalaz, “hailstone,” shows the shaping drizzle of uruz frozen into a solid form: thepattern, instead of the patterning force. It is always spoken of as a “cold grain”; this shows the seed-pattern of shaping held in this rune. This is the rune of the primal crystal which bears the samerelationship to the overall pattern of being that the DNA of a single cell bears to the ideal (unaltered)shape of the body. The reference in the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem, “then it turns to water,” writes forth therelationship between hagalaz and uruz, the essential blueprint and the force which endlessly works tobring it forth, Ymir and Audhumbla. It will be noticed that the vertical model of the Norse cosmos ispatterned in the exact shape of the stave in the Younger Futhark, the literal glyph for the crystalline shape.Hagalaz represents the unchanging structure or set pattern of the Nine Worlds in the tree Yggdrasillthrough which all living wights move and through which the runic energies flow-the unity of “organic”and “inorganic.” You may see this relationship by finding a quartz crystal which is either naturallysymmetrical or has been shaped to the six-sided form. Looking at the tip, you may see the younger formof hagalaz inside the solid hailstone, a symbol which contains all the other runes and which continued tobe used as a mighty hex sign even in the Pennsylvania Dutch settlements in America.[2]The crystal isuseful in understanding this aspect of hagalaz if you meditate on the relationship between the ordered,unchanging crystal form and the energies which one can guide to flow through it. Hagalaz is a greatcontroller and focuser of energies, as written forth in the Havamal, where it is spoken of as a rune with48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"which to control the wild might of fire-raw active power.The use of crystals in runic magic, while not a part of original Germanic working, can neverthelessbe a powerful addition to it, as shown through the rune hagalaz. The very word “crystal” comes from theGreekkrystallos,meaning ice, a term ringing close enough to the rune name “hailstone.” Using a quartzcrystal in runework can have the effect of potentiating this rune through the wholeness of hagalaz andbringing it to being in all the Nine Worlds (nine, the number of this rune, also being the number ofcompleteness and bringing forth to full being). In this setting the imaginative vitki can find countless usesfor the terminated crystal in runeworkmg. The naturally symmetrical stone is best; next best is one whichhas been shaped into perfect symmetry by a machine. Asymmetrical crystals are less effective in thiscontext and occasionally given unpredictable results, For hagalaz, the shape of the crystal is veryimportant.Hagalaz, being the rune of perfect and unchanging structure, is a mighty rune of warding whenused against entropic forces, as indicated by the line, “the sickness of snakes” in the Old Icelandic RunePoem. This line refers to the embodiments of venom which endlessly gnaw at the roots of the World-Tree; that is, which try to break down the structure that embodies the order necessary for the preservationof life. This rune is most effective as a rune of warding when used on a building, as has been traditionalfor hundreds of years.The main effect of hagalaz on the individual life is to bring you into unity with the universalpattern, which often appears as a mighty and seemingly woe-working breakage of the everyday life. TheAnglo-Saxon Rune Poem reference shows this process of breakage and regrowth according to the seed ofthe pattern (hagalaz) through the shaping powers of water (uruz).Above all, hagalaz is the rune of completion and bringing into being. It may be seen, in one sense,as the passive form of thurisaz, and in another sense as its antithesis. Thurisaz melds fire and ice to createforce which breaks down form; hagalaz uses ice and fire to create that form which holds and guides force.Thurisaz is active, more in the way of fire; hagalaz is unmoving, more in the way of ice. Sides of thebeing of both are destructive or disruptive for the sake of regeneration, and both are associated withYmir-thurisaz in that Ymir is the proto-jotun of blind force and strength, father (and mother) of the wholerace of thurses, and hagalaz in that the androgynous Ymir is the first coalescing around the original seed-crystal of the universe and the source of the structure of the World-Tree. It is interesting to note that theterminated crystal holds the shapes of both hagalaz and thurisaz-hagalaz in the pattern and thurisaz in thepointed tip bringing the forces of all the sides together and aiming them.Used with other runes, hagalaz brings them into complete being on all levels. You shouldremember that nine is the greatest Germanic number of power.Hagalaz may be seen as the equivalent of the hexagram in establishment Western magic, whichalso represents the unified structure of the universe.Hagalaz: MeditationYou stand in the center of a small, hex-shaped crystaL surrounded by a six-spoked framework thatreaches all through the crystal, which is rigid, clear, and cold as ice. You find that you can move easilyand at will within this pattern, although you cannot alter it; and indeed you fear to try, thinking that if youshould cause one break in the crystal the whole would crumble, leaving you to the darkness outside.Your crystal slowly begins to grow, the glittering walls moving farther and farther back and lightgleaming less brightly from the icy pattern inside as it stretches farther and farther above your head.

Looking up, you see the clouds coming in swiftly, huge mountains of darkblue-gray mist sailing across the sky towards you.

Nauthiz represents the unloosing of potentialenergy on all levels.This rune is the force of friction and resistance which builds up the individual strength and will. Itsbeing is best written out in the sayings, “Every battle that doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger,” and “Nopain, no gain.” You may mark that the stave shape resembles that of a gebo-rune with one line straight upand the other canted. This rune, like gebo, embodies the need of sacrifice for results; however, unlikegebo, it is not a rune of mutual interaction, but of the type of sacrifice to self in which all the energy isguided in one path-the power of imbalance, as set against the balance of gebo.In the earthly body, nauthiz shows forth as the phenomenon of “hysterical strength”: the suddenburst of adrenaline which makes ordinary people capable of seemingly impossible feats of strength indesperate circumstances and which is one of the components of the berserker-power. Magically, it is therune which gives you the strength not only to meet trials but to overcome them. It is most effective whenyou are working to counter or “write around” that which has already been written in the Well of Urdhr, as51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"may be seen clearly in Odhinn’s many workings to overcome the doom of Ragnarok by ensuring that anew and even better world shall emerge after the downfall.

In its ability to deal with the woe-workingsof Wyrd, it is also a rune of counter-spelling, as described in the Sigrdrifumal where the valkyrja Sigrdrifagives Sigurth a veiled warning about the enchanted draught of ale he is shortly to face, which, by forcinghim into love with Guthrun and betrayal of Sigrdrifa (Brynhild) will bring about his death. She tells himto “Learn ale runes ekeIlest other man’s wifeIbetray thee who trusted in her:Ion thy beer horn scratchit I and the back of thy hand I and the Nauth rune on thy nails”.[1]Nauthiz can write around both thatwhich has been written by the Norns and that which has been written by other wights, if you know whento use it.Nauthiz represents the power to deal with all factors of stress, as described in the Havamal.In the personal sphere, nauthiz should be called upon to strengthen yourself at need and turn woeinto weal. As well as sudden bursts of great bodily might, Nauthiz brings sudden bursts of creativeinspiration; the cliche “necessity is the mother of invention” writes it forth well. It is the rune that bringsforth the full range of your inner might when it is most needed. It also aids in the growth of your self-discipline.Nauthiz is the stave of the inner stress which drives you to either greatness or an early grave,sometimes both. It can cause compulsiveness and obsession.The woe and weal of nauthiz’s working are so mingled that you can hardly use the one without theother. When it is used on another person, it may give him/her the strength to endure suffering or it maybring about hardships which teach that person an important lesson and ultimately strengthens her/him.However, whether the stress caused by nauthiz ends in destroying or empowering its object is entirelydependent on that person’s inner, hidden strength.Ritually, nauthiz is the rune of banishings and cleansing by fire, especially the need-fire and thesmoke of recels. When blended with other runes, nauthiz can be called upon in its being as the rune ofcounterspells and writing around writtenorlog,particularly in the setting of the many rune-readingswhich are done before and after each runic working.Nauthiz develops both the will and the self-sufficiency of the vitki. Its hardships must be facedwith only your own might, and only the self-generated fire can overcome them. Nauthiz is the rune oftrial and testing.The stone of nauthiz is obsidian-glass hardened by intense fire until it can be shaped into weaponswhich can take the sharp and painful edge of need. Obsidian is said to be a psychological tester whichshows you the faults in yourself and the sufferings you must undergo to overcome them.Nauthiz: MeditationYou crouch in thin, dead grass on a mountainside at night, hungry and alone. A chilling windsweeps down from the peak, cuttingthrough your wool tunic and patchy cloak as if you were naked,freezing your very bones. The waning moon glitters off patches of frost on the scraggly grass around youand shows your breath as little white clouds of ice in the air. Your cows huddle together near you. Theyare thin, with scruffy coats, and most of them have the cloudy eyes and running sores of sickness.Spreading your cloak to block the wind, you pick up a block of beech wood with a small hollow cut intoit, a small bow, and a stick of wood. Putting the end of the stick against the hollow, you turn it rapidlyback and forth with the bow. Your hands grow tired soon, but you keep at it doggedly, shivering as youturn the bow-drill faster and faster.Slowly the exercise begins to warm you. Your panting rasps hotlythrough your throat, breathing out great puffs of mist, but your hunger and fear keep you going. Youknow that if you cannot kindle the need-fire now, before too many of your cattle have died, you willstarve this winter. You are beginning to sweat now, your muscles shaking with tiredness. You close youreyes and keep drilling, grimly forcing your trembling arms to move faster, move faster. You do not stopuntil you feel the sudden rush of warmth from beneath your hands and see the little coal burning. Youfeed the fire slowly with kindling, putting a few leaves of dead grass on it the frost hissing away as they52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"catch alight, and then a few little sticks. Slowly you build your fire up until you no longer need to protectit from the wind with your cloak.The wind from the north blows a black stream of smoke straight away from your need-fire.

They are still thin whenthey come out, their coats still rough and matted, but the sores are gone and their dim eyes have cleared.Suddenly you hear a deafening rumbling above you. A shower of rocks tumbles straight down themountainside towards you, boulders bigger than a man falling and ripping a torrent of earth with them.You run as fast as you can, hurling yourself forward in a desperate try to escape. With one mighty burstof speed, you fling yourself just past the edge of the rockfall, but one of the great boulders hits a juttingcrag and bounds straight at you. Your body seems to explode in a split second of fire. As your eyes clear,you see the rock lying more than thirty feet away from you, cracked jaggedly in two. Amazed, you walkover to look at it. Smoke rises from the broken edges; it is too hot for you to touch.A larger rock lies next to it, knocked aside by the might of your blow. Where it had been, there is adark cavern in the mountainside. When you look straight into the opening, you can see that it is notwholly dark; a faint fire glows from the walls.You step inside and walk along the tunnel.

The snakes ignore you, writhing through the roots; there are noeyes in their fanged heads. Past this chamber is a short passage which leads up to a well of bubblingwater, which stands at the foot of a great, dark evergreen. Three women sit turning a wheel that is half-hidden in the tree trunk and dips into the waters of the well. They wear dark cloaks that hide their faces.They do not speak. You know that you are near to the Norns at the Well of Urdhr. They are turning theWyrd of the worlds, shaping the branches and roots of Yggdrasill. It feels to you as if the endless turningof the wheel is rubbing against your own skin, filling you with pain and frustration and the dry heat ofburning friction.You are about to cry out when you feel a tap on your shoulder. Turning, you see a tall, powerfulman on a horse behind you. He is clothed in forest green, his face shadowed by his cloak’s dark hood. Hedoes not speak, but you can feel the heat glowing from him as he reaches down and hands you a root thatis twisted back over itself, turning till it has completely retwined its path.Looking through the loop in its end, you see as if you were watching from a great height. Shiningmen and women battle with creatures of darkness, fire, and stone on a broad plain. A gigantic serpentwrithes across the plain, leaving a mile-wide trail of wreckage behind it. From the other side, amountainous wolf roars, rivers of froth foaming from its jaws.You see Odhinn on eight-legged Sleipnir riding towards the wolf, his dark blue cloak flying behindhim in his own wind. The Fenris-Wolf lurches forward suddenly; the jaws close on the Allfather.Behind Odhinn rides the hooded, silent man who gave you the root: Vidar, begotten of Odhinn’sfore-sight to avenge his father’s death. He leaps off his horse, running towards the Wolf. Fenris’ vast jawsopen again; it seems that Vidar has only leapt to his death in the Wolf’s great throat, but a sudden flash oflight bursts from its huge head. Vidar steps out, hood blown back and golden hair streaming free. Hisburst of strength has torn the Fenris-Wolf asunder. A mighty blast of wind blows from the Wolfs rippedcorpse, blowing back Vidar’s hair and cloak as though he stood in the middle of a storm.The loop in the root clouds again, and when you look up, Vidar is gone. You trace the retwisting ofthe root, glancing at the Norns who spin silently on and wondering if the turning of Odhinn’sweirdwilltruly end at Ragnarok.You return to your own body with the root, feet plantedfirmlyon the earth, knowing the powerwithin you which you can reach at need through the rune nauthiz.53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ISAGaldr-sound:ecceeceeccee(as in “see”; sung on a steady, absolutely unwavering, tightly focused pitch,sharp and high)Letter: I(Ice) is very cold and exceedingly slippery it glistens, clear as glass very much like gems, a floor made of frost is fair to see.— Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem(Ice), we call the broad bridge the blind need to be led.

As the being of fire is energy, expansion,motion, passion, and change, so the being of ice is solidity, contraction, stillness, calmness, andunchangeability. Although Niflheimr holds the primal life-stuff of yeast and death-stuff of venom, thesecannot come forth directly from the ice; it must first be melted into the rushing waters of Hvergelmir.The elemental ice shows complete immobility, which in its ultimate form is antimatter, as withoutthe motion which holds the substance of the atom together there would be complete disintegration.However, as ice works in Midgardhr, together with the fire which is in all things to some degree, it issimply the force which slows energy and causes solidification, concentration, and density. As the runefehu embodies warmth, fruitfulness, life-force, and conflict, so does the rune isa embody cold, barrenness,death, and still peace. The reference to the “broad bridge” in the Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme seems to bea reference to a river covered with ice, which makes a very broad bridge indeed. Seen within the shape ofthe Nine Worlds, it speaks of the bridge to Het the second line perhaps being a reference to blind Hodhr.You must not forget how closely Niflheimr, the realm of ice, and Hel are bound together in the Northernmind. To reach the realm of Hel, you must lower your own vibrational level; this bridge is broad becausethis is very easy to do and is, in fact the ordinary way of the soul after death. This maybe set against thepurifying flames (intense vibration) of the narrow bridge Bifrost.54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Isa, the “I” rune, is also the strength of the ego, and it is a bridge also in the sense that it providessafe passage through the turbulent waters (laguz) of initiation-both because it guards the ego fromdissolution by holding the vitki’s concentration firm and warding it against the stresses placed on it, andbecause it provides a sound mental “footing” as you travel through the dark abyss. The rune-poem line “adanger to fey men” shows the perils of trying to travel on this way before you are ready. The ice of yourego may seem thick and strong, but it is often surprisingly brittle and soft beneath the glistening surface,and if you have allowed your ego to deceive you about your magical and mental prowess, the bridge ofice will break. At best, you must tread with utmost care; the power of isa is, indeed, “exceedinglyslippery,” and any crack in the ice of your concentration will drop you into the dark waves beneath.Isa is the antithesis of fehu in all ways. It can be used in workings of woe to bring aboutbarrenness, to interfere with prosperity, and to cause depression and lack of the will to act. As fehu is therune of energy and movement, so isa is the rune of binding. It can be used to set battle-fetter and causeparalyzing fear or obsession; it works to prevent or halt movement, both that of growth and that ofdisintegration.As a rune of control, isa should generally not be brought into direct contact with fehu except asguided by the workings of thurisaz and hagalaz. As described in the Havamal, isa is a “sea- rune”: theunruly powers that it is best at calming and guiding are those seen as wild winds or waters, such as themight of troubled circumstances and confusion.In the personal sphere, isa can be used to strengthen powers of concentration and stabilize thepersonality. Care should be taken, however, that you do not render yourself or another dull or obsessive.Isa works to calm hysteria, hyperactivity, and restlessness.In the side of its being which is part of Hel andthe ice of death, isa is often used in magics of revenge and defense.In ritual workings, isa embodies the unbreakable will and concentration of the mage. Isa can beused to numb pain of the heart or the body.Together with other runes, isa can be used to bind or to “shield” one rune from another to keepthem from interacting, although generally making a separate taufr is simpler and more effective.Stones which may work well with some sides of isa’s being are herkimer diamond, which is said tohold thoughts and energies stilt and gem silica, which is calming and relieving, particularly to the pain offemale troubles.Isa: MeditationIt is night. The thin crescent of the waning moon sheds a pale light over the snow-covered groundaround you. You stand near the bank of a huge, powerfully rushing black river, its wild waters laced withwhite froth and tumbling chunks of ice. A strong, freezing wind blows about you, quickly numbing yourface and hands.You feel that you need to cross to the other side of the river. It is as if you were bound to a pathleading across it, but the river is too wide and its icy waters run too deep and fast for you to even thinklong about fording it.You walk closer to the edge of the bank, your boots leaving deep footprints in the blue-white snow.As you near the water, you hear a sharp cracking sound and feel your footing beginning to tilt beneathyou. You try to scramble away, but the thick ice over the river’s edge has already broken off flinging youface-down on one of the larger chunks. You must cling to your piece of ice, embracing its numbing coldtightly. It tilts sickeningly, one way and another, as the black waters whirl it around and around, sweepingyou unstoppably downstream on the little floe that threatens to dump you into the river at any moment.Slowly, moving an arm or leg to balance yourself every few seconds, you draw yourself up until you aresitting in the center of your piece of ice, which, balanced, no longer tilts so alarmingly. You can see nowthat all the solid snow on the banks is actually a roof of rime over the wide black sea, holding its rushingwildness back except where the betraying waters sweep you along. Carefully, concentrating on everymotion to keep from tilting the ice or sliding off, you rise to your feet and stand in the position of isa, feettogether and arms over your head, feeling the stillness of the rune come over you like a shield against thewind.When you open your eyes, you stand on a fixed island of ice in the middle of the water, a white55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"bridge stretching to the other shore of snow.

Your eyes neverwaver from the white line ahead of you until you stand on solid ground again.You look out over the blue-white field of snow to the glacial mountains in the distance. Somethingis moving in the snow, coming closer.

A black wolf runs at the woman’s heel, its mournful howlcutting through the still air like a needle of ice. The stag is panting hard, little clouds of ice crystalspuffing out of its mouth. Its dark eyes roll desperately as the huntress skis nearer.Although you do not hear the bowstring’s twang, you feel the cold streak of the arrow passing you.Its dark length sinks into the chest of the stag without leaving a wound.

If I see ghost-riders I sporting in the sky,I can work it I that the wild ones fare away so their spirits fare home.Havamal 155The shape of the rune jera shows the way in which the Germanic peoples thought of the seasonsand their interactions, particularly concerning the ways of farming. The Teutonic year is not divided intofour seasons, but two, summer and winter, which work upon each other continuously. The harvest of thesummer is food for the winter. At the beginning of the winter, you plant the seeds which must lie underthe earth for a season in order to sprout as summer comes near. The rune-name, literally “year” speaks ofnot only the course of a year, but of a good year with a rich harvest-a year in which all planting, tending,reaping, and soon has been done as was fitting within the outer timetable of the year and its changeableweather and the inner timetable of the plants themselves. The relationship between raidho and thefulfillment of jera should be plain. Like raidho also, jera is a rune of the sun’s cycle, being the cycle of theyear as raidho is the cycle of the day. The alternate stave-shape of jera is the same as the alternate form of ingwaz: the glyph indicatingthe complete male genitalia (as setagainstthe Elder Futhark’s ingwaz, which shows the castrated male).This shows one of the workings of the god Freyr in the process of bringing-into-being: Freyr as Lord ofthe World. Although the pattern of cyclical growth is “feminine,” as set against the “masculine” straightline, it needs the masculine force of Freyr to bring it to full being. The alternate stave-shape shows thestraight line passing into the circle, bringing out this rune’s interaction-of-opposites in yet another way.Jera may be looked at as, in a sense, a “Teutonic yin-yang,” showing the interlocking of fire57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"(summer) and ice (winter) not as warring opposites but as interacting complements. Only the raw primalforces of fire and ice are violent together. Jera shows their weal-working interaction within the ring ofMidgardhr, calmed by their manifestation through the secondary elements of water, air, and earth. Jeradiffers from the eastern yin-yang in that it shows this unity not as a circle, but as a spiral in which eachturn brings the whole to further growth. This is related to the thought of every action or happening beinglayered on the last and shaped by it; you cannot return to the beginning, as in a circle. Jera shows aprocess of endless cyclical growth and weal-working change, seen in its highest form as the growth of the“seed” planted in humankind by the gods to reach the wisdom and power of our godly kindred.Jera shows the natural development of spiritual understanding, which cannot be hurried or forced.It is a rune of patience and of awareness, of moving in harmony with both your inner changes (the “seed”)and the changes of the world around you (“seasons” and weather”). Jera is not a rune of immediategratification, but a rune of long-term planning and the day-by-day process of bringing your plans to fruit.Magically, jera is used to bring your will into effect slowly and naturally, a process which is almostalways more effective and desirable than forcing change on an unready world. Like nauthiz, jera isassociated with the original meaning of Wyrd, “to turn”; however, nauthiz is the power of turning aroundor “counter-turning” Wyrd, while jera is the power of turning with the flow of Wyrd, making slow andsubtle changes in it which can only be seen as they come into being.In the personal sphere, jera is used to aid the growth of your own understanding and to guide you infinding the correct times for rituals, especially initiation. Jera helps to determine the time for increases inthe difficulty or power of your magical workings, according to what you are truly ready for. It can also beused to develop the potentials which lie like seeds within everyone and which require long care and dailytending to bring them to fruition. It is used to ensure the success of plans.In workings of woe jera can be used to bring the worst possible layers of someone’sweirdtofruition or to develop the seeds of self-destruction which also lie within everyone. The spiral of jera canturn downward as well as upward.The spiraling form of jera and its relationship to the movement of nature is what makes it aneffective rune of warding against woe- workingseidhkonur(“witches”); the spiral current disperses spiritfarers and unturns such workings that are not part of the course of nature.Jera is a good rune for workings involving fruitfulness or any sort of interaction with nature. It alsorules the creative process, from the seed idea through the completed concept and the finished work.Ritually, jera represents the series of daily meditations which, practiced faithfully, lead you slowlyinto higher levels of consciousness and power. Used with other runes, it brings them into being throughthe workings of nature and the normal turnings of Wyrd.Jera shows the entire cycle of interaction between the earthgoddess and fertilizing god: his birth,marriage, sacrifice, and rebirth. This cycle is described more fully by the runes berkano and ingwaz andthe conceptual ties between the three runes. Ingwaz is the seed planted, berkano is the earth that receivesit, and jera is the growth and harvest.The stone associated with jera is moss agate, which is traditionally tied to the plowman’s arm andthe horns of his cattle to ensure fruitful fields and breeding. Moss agate aids you in a deep attunement tothe movements of nature and the natural cycle which is jera.Jera: MeditationYou stand in the middle of a field. The sun shines brightly, but there is a sharp bite of frost in theair and the day is turning rapidly towards night. Around you, men and women in plain farmers’ tunics ofbrown wool are harvesting the wheat that grows tall, rich, and golden. Scythes whirl to cut the graindown; behind the reapers follow the gleaners who gather the stalks into bundles, and behind them followthe sowers, planting the autumn seed which must lie in the ground all winter. You join these last,collecting a sheaf of grain from one of the gleaners and picking up a digging tool. The ground is cold andclaylike under your hands, and it feels to you almost as if you are digging in grave mold among thebeheaded stalks that rustle like wraiths above you. You bury each seed and cover it carefully, neither too58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"deep in the earth nor too near its surface.When the sun has set, leaving only a stain of blood-red light in the west against the darkening sky,you go into a great hall with the other harvesters. The feast is set with all the fruits of summer’s end,bowls filled to overflowing with wild berries and grains and great loaves of bread on the table. A hugepair of roast pigs, boar and sow, grace the middle of the table. At its head sits a tall man with blond hairand beard, dressed in a yellow tunic and sky-blue cloak with a crown of stag’s antlers. Behind him is awoman whose deep green dress curves richly over her body, the torchlight catching gleams of red fromher long dark hair.The Lady rises and walks about the table, pouring out thick, rich beer. You blow the creamy headoff your horn and taste the rich, nutty grain-flavor of its malt. Laughing, the Lord raises up a scepter asthick as his wrist, chanting, “May Mornir receive this gift!” He passes it about the table, each of thefarmers repeating his words in turn. It is leathery in your hand; looking close as you chant “May Mornirreceive this gift!” you see that it is the stuffed phallus of a stallion, fully erect and smelling faintly ofherbs. You pass it on to make the round of the table.Snow has begun to fall outside, covering the fields with a soft white blanket. The Lady veils herhair in black, her face still and a little frightening. The winter turns around you, freezing the land to a still,brittle world of ice and snow and the days darkening. When there is no more light, the Lord leads a greatsnow-white boar, its neck garlanded with rosemary, into the hall and around the table. Everyone leansforward to touch it and voice a vow or boast. The swine’s hide is warm and comforting beneath yourfingers; its dark eyes look up at you and you are silent and awed by the might of the god within it. Itfollows the Lord to the harrow of heaped stones at the end of the hall, standing still as he cuts its throatand the blood springs out in a torrent. As the boar falls to the floor, the Lord sprinkles its blood onto thefolk from a bowl. A few drops touch you, filling you with warmth as you feel the year turning upwardagain within you. The folk move together out of the halt where a great wooden wheel stands, woven withstraw and pitch. The Lord brings a firebrand out; you and several others set your shoulders to the wheel,and as he lights it you push. It rolls off, slow and wobbly at first, then picking up speed as it blazes downthrough the snow-covered fields. The wheel of fire burns along the dark pathways, flaming and whirlingtill far, far down the hill it plunges into the icy river with a great hiss, a white cloud of steam rising up.The winter turns around you and gradually the days become longer again and the ice begins to meltleaving bare fields of dry stubble behind. The sun brightens, and finally you see the first shoots of greenpricking through the earth. The light shines brightly from the golden hair and stag’s antlers of the Lordand the free-flowing auburn tresses of the Lady as they stoop to tend the fields with you and the otherfarmers. The beginning of summer is an endless round of work, one day much like another as you bendand pull and dig in the earth until at last the wheat is tall and strong. With summer’s height, most of thework in the fields is done, but there are cattle and swine and sheep to tend as you wait for the harvest.The sun reaches its height on a day without night, and you light the Midsummer’s fires in broaddaylight, dancing around them, drinking ale, and feasting. After Midsummer, the sun starts back down,the nights grow longer and the winds become cold and sharp as the field of grain turns from green to gold.When the harvest-time has come again, the Lord and the Lady come to you in the field. Each ofthem plucks a stalk of ripe grain and hands it to you, their touch filling you with mellow contentment.You bow in respect as you thank them and bid them farewell.

The evergreen that played such a great part in the world-view of theGermanics was, it has been well argued, a yew tree; the magical wand or talisman, when made out ofwood, was most often carved of yew. As the all-holding cosmic structure of Yggdrasill, the yew is indeedthe tree of magic, for there is no rune whose being it does not hold within itself. Seen in this setting, youmay understand one level of Odhinn’s runic initiation on Yggdrasill: only through the power of the yewtree could Odhinn learn the runes which are the keys to all of being in their completeness. As the turningpoint of the runic circle, eihwaz holds the entire futhark hidden within itself. A “rough tree” on theoutside, and perhaps the hardest of all the runes to fully understand, eihwaz is the “keeper of the fire”: thehidden, but all-holding might of runic wisdom. As jera embodies the interaction of opposites and thegradual growth of understanding, so does eihwaz embody the melding of opposites and the lightning flashof revealing at the completion of initiation. The yew is known to the folk as the tree of death, having beenplanted in cemeteries until this day. According to popular belief, the yew tree can “trap” the souls of thedead. This is the simple shape of a much mightier mystery-the central mystery of the rune eihwaz and, itmay be argued, the final unspoken secret of Odhinn. On the simplest level, the yew is understood to be a tree of death because it is very poisonous. It canliterally be death to eat of it and even lying beneath it can be dangerous because of the gaseous toxins itemits. As the alchemist and the magician know, however, poison is a sign of power. Alchemy purges thesubject of the physical poison to create a healing agent; magic renders the poison, properly prepared, into60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the vehicle of initiation and immortality, and both depend on the worker as much as on the processworked. The yew shows its power of life equally with its power of death. It is an evergreen, which liveswhen every other tree seems to have died, yet its poison seems to forbid its power of immortality tohumankind. In this one sees the melding of life and death, which is the might of the rune eihwaz.Odhinn’s initiation on this tree is the initiation of death in which he gains power over both death and life,returning from the dead as the mightiest of the gods.The stave-shape of the Elder eihwaz does not appear in the Younger Futhark, and it does not seem tohave been used for writing at all except as a magical sign, in contrast to the other runes which were usedphonetically as well as magically. By thinking on the nature of this rune it may be suggested as arefutation of von List’s assertion that the final secret of the Havamal was shown in either thefyrfos(swastika) or its substitute, gebo.[1] There are sixteen runes in the Younger Futhark; the Havamal listseighteen spells, implying either that two of the runes of the Elder Futhark survived as magical signs (butnot letters) or that other signs were added to the list. Of the last, Odhinn says, “I know an eighteenth thatnone know,Ineither maid nor man’s wife.IIt is always better kept secret,Iexcept to the one who lies inmy arms,Ior my sister.”[2] First Odinn states that he will not tell it, especially to any woman; then hesays that he will tell it to a mysterious feminine principle-as he has said, “neither maid nor man’s wife.”There is a certain hint of sororal incest here, even though Odhinn has no sister. The answer to this riddle isthat the god is affirming within himself the synthesis of eihwaz: the lover/sister is Odhinn’s own feminineside who, not being brought forth into being as independently female, can be “neither maid nor man’swife” and yet holds Odhinn in her arms and is also his sister. This is also, perhaps, the mystery whichOdhinn whispers into the ear of the dead Baldr, the rune which “no dweller on earth knows.”[3] It is thepower of immortality, not as an escape from death, but as an acceptance of it and the melding of life withdeath which the yew tree shows forth in all ways. This is the rune of the will which survives death andrebirth again and again, life hidden within death as the fire is hidden within the rough, cold bark of theyew. This is the rune by which Lif (life) and Lifthrasir (the stubborn will to live) hide themselves withinshoots of Yggdrasill through Ragnarok, after which they can step forth and breed the human race again onthe new earth. It is a literal description of the rebirth of power and memory which survives the death ofthe body. By this rune Baldr, hidden for a time in Hel’s protecting kingdom, is able to bring himself andHodhr forth alive again after Ragnarok. Eihwaz shows the trunk of Yggdrasill which unites Hel and Asgardhr, the dragon Nidhoggr at thebottom of the tree and the eagle at the top. The true vitki draws his/her powers from the roots and thecrown of the World-Tree alike, melding, like Odhinn, the mights of light and of darkness into a singlepower. This rune is also associated with Ullr, god of the winter sky who dwells in Ydal, “Yew-dales.” Ullr’sweapon is the yew bow. He is called upon to shield the fighter in duels. Eihwaz is used for making wands and staves, both because of its nature as the all-holding tree of therunic initiation and, perhaps, because of the implication that spells cast through a yew focus will be shotas strongly and truly as an arrow shot from a yew bow.Eihwaz can be used to send messages along the trunk of the World-Tree or to fare up and down ityourself The nameYggdrasilmeans “steed of Ygg” (Odhinn); the gallows is called “the horse of thehanged.” Through this rune, you can speak to the dead and learn wisdom from them as Odhinn does, orcall them up if your need should be so great that nothing more will suffice. ThePoetic Eddawrites howOdhinn has to ride down to the seeress’ mound at the eastern gate of Hel to chant her up, and even thenshe complains of the “fear-fraught ways” he makes her fare.[4] Both the riding and the calling forth areruled by eihwaz. It is also a rune of warding when you must fare past the bounds of thegardh,as shownwhen the movable shield which is associated with eihwaz is compared to the unmovable circle (othala).Making the dead fare to Midgardhr is a sure way to rouse their wrath, as described in the Hadding’s Saga,where the angry spirits rend the witch who has called them forth to shreds in spite of her wardings.Thewoe-working powers of eihwaz as a rune of death and power over the dead should be obvious. Eihwaz strengthens the will. It is the might which holds memory and purpose through death andrebirth, and it may be used to call upon wisdom and might from earlier existences. You can learn fromboth other dead and the dead whose knowledge and power have been passed on and hidden in your ownsoul.61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"control of both the continuation of life implicit in the sexual act and the personal death it encompassesas both the ecstatic loss of awareness and the physical giving up of vital force.

Smoky quartz has also been used in raising andguiding the spinal fire.Eihwaz: MeditationYou are walking through a forest in winter.The trees are gnarled and leafless, their craggy bark gray and black. Dead grass crunches beneath yourboots as you walk. In a little while you come out of the forest and into a field where the snow has blowninto drifts at the north sides of the stone barrows that rise from the silent earth. You look about yourselfuneasily and walk a little faster; you know that a barrows-field is a bad place for the living when eveningbegins to darken the dull gray sky.Ahead of you, you see a tall, lone tree, red berries bright among its dark green needles. As you getcloser, you mark that there is a longbow and one arrow leaning against the low stone well at the tree’sfoot.The sky is darkening, the barrow-mounds fading into uncanny shadows across the field. Somethingrustles faintly behind you. You look back quickly, but there is nothing there. You hasten to the yew treeand take up the bow and arrow.Looking around yourself, you strain your eyes to see if anything is coming through the darknessbehind you. Everything is still for a moment, then rock grates on rock and you see a pale, unholy lightfrom one of the barrow mounds. The light glows around a figure-a dry, brown corpse of a large man,whose black fingernails have grown into thick claws. His grave-clothes hang on his sinewy limbs in paletatters; rings of gold still adorn his bony fingers and arms. Thedraugrwalks clumsily and slowly, butsteadily towards you, his moon-eyed gaze filling you with fear. You want to flee but the tree behind youblocks your escape, holding you up. Still a little way from you, the draugr reaches out his arms as if toembrace you. You clutch your bow tightly; strengthened, you nock the arrow and let it fly in one smoothburst. It pierces the draugr’s withered skin and sinks between his ribs. His corpse-light goes out and youhear his bones clattering together as they fall into the icy grass. Amazed by the might of the bow, you pull the string back again, as far as it will go. Suddenly youhear a cracking noise. The bow breaks before you can drop it, sinew wrapping around your neck andchoking your wind off as the jagged end punches into your guts with a stabbing, searing pain that spreadsthrough your body like fiery poison. Your feet dangling, you hang onto the spear of yew wood in youwith a death-grip as a mighty wind roars up around you.The pain slowly fades into numbness. Your sight darkens and clears again as you look down into thekingdom of Hel far, far below at the roots of the tree on which you hang. The land is all black and gray.Corpses move slowly about like beetles in it, some fresh with the marks of sickness or bleeding woundson them, some green or black with rot, and some all bare bones. Serpents gnaw at the roots of the tree likemaggots at flesh. You see yourself mirrored far below: a hanged corpse with black face and dead tonguesticking out, circled by ravens who pluck off beakfuls of meat. Above, you see a shining eagle at thecrown of the tree, a noble bird over the roof of a golden hall which glows like a jewel. You hang halfwaybetween, the winds turning your body about. Far down at the root, you see a spark running up the trunk of the tree from the nest of serpents. Thespark grows to a great flash of fire, striking upward through your body like a lightning bolt.

Tacitus has written thateven while sober, the Germanic warriors would gamble for hours until one had lost all his possessionsand had to wager his own freedom on a toss of the dice, and that if he lost that throw, he would gocheerfully into slavery, even under a weaker man, because he thought it to be the will of “fate.”1 In thisseemingly excessive and pointless game, one of the greatest parts of the Teutonic spifitual understandingmay be seen: the deep awareness of the turnings of Wyrd. While the vitki may sometimes write his Iherownweirdor at least write around it, the ordinary woman or man can only meet it with courage. Henceyou see the typical image of the Norseman laughing as he goes forth to die, as well as the high worthplaced on the “luck” of a leader or king, for it was clearly better to fight for someone whoseweirdwaswritten for success and victory.Perthro is the rune of divination. The dice of the early Germanic tribes show this might in its crudestform-the same method is used for tossing the dice and casting the runes, and the root understanding is thesame: that the web of that-which-is and that-which-is-becoming is so woven together that the idea ofrandomness or “coincidence” is impossible. Thus the dice show orlog* on the level of personal fortune,and the runes show the shape of this web in all ways. Both dice and runes are tossed out of a cup, which isthe earthly embodiment of the Well of Wyrd from which flow all the runes that the Norns have written.The act of casting the runes thus partakes of the magical law of sympathy. As the runic streams flow fromthe Well, they must be reflected in the carven staves flowing from the cup with perthro, the rune of theWell, written on it.The act of divination is the willed attempt to reach an aware- ness of the workings ofthat-which-is on that-which-is-becoming and that-which-should-be, or an awareness of the contents of theWell in their wholeness. Urdhr’s Well is the side of the Well’s being which is active and choosing, butthis side of its being is necessarily based on the well of “Mimir,” which holds all of that-which-is. Thename Mimir seems similar to the name of Ymir, the proto-etin, the difference being that the runesmannaz, the rune of thought and memory, and isa, the rune of the ego, are put in the stead of jera, whichshows a natural, unconscious process. Hence, it might be said that Mimir can be seen as the embodimentof the self-awareness of the cosmos. The story of Odhinn giving up an eye for a drink fromC Mimir’sWell can be understood easily when one realizes the nature of the well itself. By internalizing the entireawareness of that- which-is, Odhinn changed his own sight so that he could at once see the evolving“present” as most are aware of it and the whole structure of the hidden layers which lie beneath and shapeit. This is the third root of Odhinn’s power: as he gained the runes themselves by his initiation onYggdrasill (eihwaz), and the power to use them with the might of galdr-magic by the poetic inspiration of64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Odhroerir (ansuz), so he gained the awareness of the workings of Wyrd, of his own ability to alter it, andthe knowledge of what should come of his workings from Mimir’s Well (perthro).

In later usage, the wordalogwas used for a spell, particularly a curse, implying the relationshipbetween the working of magic and the Well of Wyrd. Perthro can be used for all manner of divinations and for an understanding of all the workings of Wyrdthrough the worlds, including an awareness of synchronicity and an understanding of the entire pattern ofuniversal evolution.In workings of woe, perthro can be used for intensifying the woe-bringing effects of Wyrd inanother’s life, or for awareness of another’s actions.Perthro is the rune by which you can gain the wisdom and the awareness to use the runes withoutunknowingly destroying yourself or another. It gives you the capability to “think runically”~to see theworkings of the forces of the runes in daily life and to under- stand how to use them in a setting whichseems to have changed greatly from the time that first learned and wrote of them.Ritually, perthro represents the cup of runecasting and the several-fold process of self-checking byrunecasting, which should go with any active use of runic magic.Used with other runes, perthro receives them and sends them out into being. It is the passivecomplement of the active uruz in the context of the Well.Perthro can be used to tap into the wisdom of Mimir’s Well and to recover knowledge about the runesthemselves that has either been forgotten or was never learned by humans. It is the rune of meditation.Astone which works well with perthro is layered onyx, the pattern of which shows the layers uponlayers that determine the shape ofweird.The onyx has often been thought of as a stone of ill-luck; in fact,it embodies orlog, the effects of which are often woe-bringing and need the willed resistance of nauthiz toalter or mitigate. By meditating on the layered pattern of this stone, you may come to a betterunderstanding of the workings of Wyrd and the structure of that-which-is.Pertliro: Meditation You are inside a hall, sitting on a circle of rough wooden benches with a group of long-haired,bearded warriors. The fire burns in a pit in the center of the hall, the smoke rising out of a hole in thethatched roof. Pale winter daylight shines through the hole. Your cloak wards you from the bitter coldbehind, and the fire warms you from the front, aided by the thick ale you drink from your horn. The otherwarriors are garbed similarly, wearing heavy cloaks but light tunics and breeches. A dice-cup is passingaround the circle, each man shaking it until he makes either a good throw and can pass it on or a losingcast, in which case he must strip off one of his heavy gold bracelets and pass it with the cup. You knowthat this game can keep on until one man has lost everything he owns, even his freedom if that is hisweird. When the cup gets to you, you rattle it for a long time, the dice inside clicking against the wood likebones. You sense when it is time to cast the dice. You let them falL knowing that whatever yourweird,itis already written. Two of the dice show sixes; the third has become no longer a die but a strip of rough-hewn wood on which the rune perthro is graven. As you stare into the rune, it grows and grows until yoursight is wholly overwhelmed by its dark and mysterious might. Slowly the rune fades from around you, and you find yourself standing at the foot of the greatevergreen Yggdrasill, looking down into the Well of Wyrd.

You would like to speak to them but you know that they must speak first.Their backs are to you as they sprinkle the roots and trunk of Yggdrasill. When you walk around the treeto see if they will notice you, some of the water they toss falls on your head.

There seemsto be a faint white light glowing over the Well, and you walk around again to see what it is. 4 The light comes from the bone-white fire of a torch. Standing beside the Well is a dark, stoopedfigure with the white hair and beard of an old man. Only when you come closer do you see that his bodyis too thick and powerful to be that of a human, his head too broad and features too low. For all of that,you can sense the immense wisdom in this being. He is Mimir, wisest of the etin-kind and keeper of theWell of Memory by which you stand. “Be welcome,” he says. His voice is deep and rough but not unpleasant. “What do you seek?” “A drink from your well,” you answer. He sighs. “Do you know the price?” he asks. “Once you have looked through its waters, one eye mustalways remain; once you have drunk from its waters, you must keep drinking forever.” “Nevertheless I will,” you say. “So be it,” Mimir replies, and hands you the wooden cup from which you had been casting dice. Youdip it into the dark waters of the Well. As you drink, the water before you becomes clear. You see Odhinn, cloaked in dark blue, drinking asyou drink and standing with one eye gone.

Few of the unlearned I know these things. Havamal 159The name elhaz may be derived from the words for “elk,” swan, or protection,” or possibly, fromhe Germanic twin-gods known as the Alcis. The reversed stave of the Younger Futhark is called “yew” or“yew-bow.” All of these names carry a meaning of both warding and holiness. The rune elhaz is closelyrelated to the rune mannaz; in the Younger Futhark, the stave-shape is given the namemad/ir,or “man.”The two runes are alike in that both refer to the spirit in earthly shape that is the being of humanity, thedifference lying in that elhaz rules the pathways between the gods and humans and the drawing/sendingdownward of godly might, while mannaz is the rune of the indwelling, inherited seed of the godly beingin humankind. The alternate shape of this stave, the Younger Futhark’s “yew” (I ), is also associated witheihwaz, and the primal tree-shape (I) is very similar to the snowflake-shape of hagalaz ( I).The differenceis that the “branches” are connected to the “roots” by a bridge showing the human awareness ofMidgardhr as the middle of all things, “man in the middle.” The rune elhaz shows the awareness of thehuman that she or he is both a microcosm of the universe and (necessarily, because of the nature of67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"human perceptions) its center. One interpretation of the stave-shape is that it shows a human with headand hands upraised in the Teutonic stance of “prayer”-that is, willed and mutual communication betweengods and humans. The full tree-shape shows this communication with both the wights above and thewights below Midgardhr. As the rune showing the threefold bridge Bifrost (made of air, fire, and water), elhaz is also arune of cleansing and warding. It is the rune by which one may hold speech with one’s own valkyrja, theswan-wingedbringer of wisdom and messenger between gods and humans. Bifrost may only be crossedby humans when they are guided by the valkyrja, when the “increase of dust”-that is, the full melding ofthe highest being of the soul with the living human awareness-has taken place. The rune elhaz is a great rune of warding, as shown by its bond with the shielding might of thevalkyrja and yew tree and by other aspects of the stave as well. The stave-shape has been suggested toshow the horns of the elk or the hand outstretched in a warding gesture~-both powerful images ofdefense. The “Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem” writes of the rune as burning, which shows the being of thewarding called upon through elhaz. It is the warding of holiness, the intense “fiery” energy, like that ofBifrost, in the presence of which nothing unclean can abide. In both thought and working the rune elhaz issimilar to establishment magic’s conception of the pentagram: it embodies the might of spirit as theguiding force within the earthly being; it shows the conscious human microcosm, as contrasted with thehagalaz of the macrocosm; it wards and makes holy at the same time. Like the antlers of the elk, elhaz isboth shield and spear: not only does it ward but it also brings woe to the enemy who tries to work woeagainst its wielder. The rune elhaz may be used to ward a person or a place, and also to hallow a place, especially ifone is about to begin a dangerous working. The power of elhaz to communicate and ward may be seen, in a sense, as a complement to thepower of eihwaz; the two yew-staves may be used harmoniously together. Elhaz may be used to fill a space or an item with the power drawn from the higher realms: tomake it “holy,” that is, both whole and filled with godly might. Elhaz is a guide to spiritual growth and cleansing through calling on the higher energies whichgradually raise the personal vibrational level. It both drives unclean energy away and brings in holy mightin its stead. At the same time, it holds a balance between the lower and higher faculties, being the bridgeof consciousness which at once unites and separates the lower and the higher. One may use the originaltree-form (I ) and stance to draw power from all the worlds. Elhaz may be used to cause woe to those who are too spiritually unrefined to benefit from itscleansing fire. It is especially mighty against the dead who have been drawn up to this plane by magicalmeans and also against all beings of the lower worlds. Ritually, elhaz rules all forms of hallowing. It may be used in most cases where the pentagramwould be called for in Western establishment magic. Elhaz may be used to fare through the worlds. The reference to “the talon-span of the hawk”speaks of the way in which several of the gods make use of the hawk shape in travelling between therealms of being. Used with other runes, elhaz brings out their highest level of spiritual workings, binding them tothe goal of evolution of the consciousness. A stone which works well with elhaz is black tourmaline, which shields against woe-workingmight and brings power down from the higher realms into earth as well as from the wheel of power at thecrown of the head to the lowest wheels (chakras).Elhaz: MeditationYou stand in the middle of a marsh in autumn.

Her upward flight slows, then stops, and she begins to circle down again. When sheis close enough, you see that the great white wings now support a surpassingly beautiful woman, armedand dressed in chain mail and leather. Her features are very like your own but perfect in a way that bringsan ache of longing to your heart. She halts halfway down, holding her arms out to you. You see that she stands on a bridge ofshimmering rainbowfire,her feet near its end. She beckons to you, but there is no bridge and no way foryou to climb the huge bare trunk of the tree. As you stretch your arms upward, however, you begin to feela stream of golden power flowing into you from the end of the bridge, a shimmering holiness that seemsto lift you up even as it brings the rainbow bridge and the swan-maiden nearer and nearer to you; yet youare aware that your feet still rest on the earth, its solidity balancing the heady wave of power flowing intoyou from above.At last you are close enough so that the tips of your outstretched fingers just touch the tips of themaiden’s. The shimmering light glows around you; you sense the mighty love, wisdom, and guidance ofyour valkyrja. You set one foot on the end of the rainbow bridge. Its fire does not burn you, but it is sostrong that you cannot yet go any farther up it. Your valkyrja bends down to kiss the top of your head.Her touch is a crown of warmth,enfolding you in her power and wise warding.

In point of fact, although deosil and widdershins are not without meaning in Teutonic magic, theydo not automatically distinguish between works of weal and works of woe. As the rune of the sun, sowilo is the rune of invincibility and final triumph. The Old Icelandic70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Rune Poem’s reference shows its being as a rune which acts both as a warder and in active combat. As thewheel, it is a shield; as a thunderbolt it is a sword. The Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme shows sowilo as aruling power and the light of life. This rune has certain conceptual ties to elhaz; you should mark that thesun, like the valkyrja, is always feminine in Germanic thought. As well as guardianship and might the sun is also guidance, as the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poemtells. “To fare far away” is a kenning used either for death or for the journeys taken by the magician in adeathlike trance. In this case, the ocean referred to may be the waters between the worlds-the dark watersof the underworld or the personal subconscious (see laguz). The magical will is the force which bringsyou through the dark night of the soul and guides you living through the death-passage. In this setting,sowilo (the sun) is closely related to raidho (the path of the sun) and to laguz (the waters which must becrossed; note similarities in the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem references). In both the shape and action ofsowilo, you may also see a certain likeness to eihwaz. Eihwaz, however, is unshakable and unchanging-the will to endur~whereas sowilo is endlessly mobil~the will to act. Both are runes of transformation.Thorsson identifies sowilo with the chakras (wheels) along the length of the spine which are vitalized bythe spinal fires of eihwaz.1Sowilo is used to strengthen the active, magical will, making it into an invincible and unstoppableforce. Both its shielding and striking capabilities are bound up in this action; nothing can assail the fullydeveloped will, and nothing can withstand it. The woeworking side of sowilo’s being can clearly be seenin Hitler’s SS, who used this rune in their insignia. Wrongly used, it is the rune of arrogance, cruelty, andisolation. The will itself is a neutral force, with weal and woe depending on its goals, as may be learnedfrom both the triumphs and the terrible destruction wrought by Hitler, who consciously believed innothing but his own will.The rune sowilo and the swastika may both be used in understanding the currents of power whichswirl widdershins through the earth and deosil through the heavens, coming forth from and meeting at thepoles.In ritual usage, sowilo is associated with the hammer of hallowing. Used with other runes, sowiloactivates and vitalizes.Sowilo can be used with meditations on the wheels of the body (chakras). It brings out the abilityfor active leadership; that is, the ability to inspire others with your own will. It is not a rune for victory inthe same manner as tiwaz, but it is the rune of active triumph and of warding from wounds and defeat.Tiwaz is a rune by which you may overcome others; sowilo is a rune by which you strengthen yourself.The stone most traditionally associated with sowilo is the Norse sunstone (identified as iolite bysome, Icelandic spar by others) which, because of its refractive properties, was a valuable navigational aidto Norse seafarers. There is also another stone called sunstone, an orange form of moonstone whichreflects light brilliantly and works well with this rune. Also appropriate to sowilo is the diamond which,like the rune, is brilliantly invincible, its very name meaning either “unconquerable” or “hardest steel.”The diamond is a great stone of warding and also brings shining might into the wheels of the body.Sowilo: Meditation You stand in a grassy field, a little way from the edge of a red sandstone cliff. Beyond the cliff, you canhear the waves beating against the rocks. A strong salt breeze blows cool around you. Gulls and ternscircle overhead, calling sharply.You take a step towards the ocean and at once your way is blocked by a horde of dark figures thatseem to have sprung up from the ground. They stand before you like warriors’ statues carved from blackice. They do not move until you try to step forward again; then their swords and shields are up at once. Afew drops of water run off them in the sunlight, but a cloud is already moving across the sun to shieldthem. Without faltering, you step forward again, tracing the rune sowilo with each hand. In your left handthe rune becomes a spinning swastika-wheel of white light; in your right, it is a thunderbolt-shapedsword. You push your way through the warriors of ice. As they strike at your shield, the swords melt intheir hands; when your sword touches them, they flow into pools of water, soaking into the grass. By the time you reach the wind-eaten edge of the cliff, the icy warriors have all been slain. The71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"sun above you has burned through the clouds, and her bright light strengthens you. Looking over the edgeof the red cliff, you see a small boat resting on the stony beach below. Wind and wave have bitten deeplyinto the cliff so that, ravaged and gouged, it leans over the ocean. You see no way down, but you knowthat you must reach the boat. With your sword of light you begin to strike at the edge of the cliff, carvingout a few steps, then moving down them and hacking away a few more. The wave- eaten sandstonecrumbles away in great chunks, shattering to ruddy sand on the beach below. You know that it couldcollapse at any moment but are so intent on your blade biting into the rock that you have no time to feelany fear.At last you reach the bottom, standing on the rocky beach. The boat is a simple rowboat, perhapsa bit small for seafaring, but it looks sturdy enough. You push it away from the beach, your feet andcalves numbed by the stinging, icy water. When it is floating well free of the bottom, you haul yourself upover the side. The waves catch your craft, flinging it about violently as you try to paddle beyond the surfto the open ocean. Finally you must toss your shield into the air before you. The sun-wheel whirls overthe prow, pulling the boat straight after it, parting the swells before you. You sail like this for some time. Although the sky darkens quickly around a pale sunset, thespinning wheel before you gives off enough light for you to see clearly, glowing over the water ahead ofyou. Something large nudges against the bottom of your boat, trying to bump it off course or perhapsoverturn it, but it cannot shake you from the path of light, and after a while it leaves you to fare in peace. As the sun comes up behind you in the east, you see a dark mass of land ahead of you. You sailtowards it until your boat grounds against the beach with a bump. Taking up your whirling shield of light,you wade ashore. A shining figure is walking along the beach towards you. It is a woman dressed inwhite, her long golden hair unbound and flowing loosely around her face. Warmth and glory radiatesfrom her. Above her head is a small radiant white sphere,spinning swiftly enough for you to hear its clear note. In her hands she carries a crown bearing awhirling golden sowilo-rune with a glittering diamond in its center. You bow your head before her gloryand she crowns you. The intense might of the spinning sun-rune above you glows down through yourbody, setting the wheels of power whirling down your spine. Slowly you return to your own body, feelingthe might that runs through you surround you in a whirling sphere of holiness and warding, though yourfeet always remain firmly planted on the earth. 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"TIWAZGaldr-sound: tiw-tiw-tiw (to rhyme with “few”; short and sharp)Letter: T(Tir) is a star, it keeps faith well with athlings, always on its course over the mists of night it never fails.Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem(Tyr) is the one-handed among the Aesir the smith has to blow often.Old Norwegian Rune Rhyme(Tyr) is the one-handed god and the leavings of the wolf and the ruler of the temple.Old Icelandic Rune PoemI know a twelfth: If I see a hanged man swinging high in a tree, I can carve and stain runes, so that the man walks and speaks with me. Havamal 157The stave-shape of tiwaz shows a spear, the weapon of the sky- father god and lord of victory. The imageof the one-handed god liftmg a spear is shown in the oldest Indo-European rock carvings and is clearlyTyr or Tiwaz, whose name in its earlier form is cognate to the Latindeus,Greektheos,and GreekZeus.Originally, Tyr held the highest place among the gods, as sky-father and lord of law, courage, and war.Only when the runes and their power became known to humans did Odhinn come forth as All-Father,assuming such sides of Tyr’s being as were not wholly contradictory to his own nature. Several of theuses of the spear in Odhinnic worship come from this assimilation, particularly the practice of casting thespear over one’s enemies to “give them to Odhinn.” Most of Tyr’s characteristics, however, were sodifferent from Odhinn’s being as to preclude assimilation, and hence though Tyr’s place in written mythis fairly limited (owing possibly to the subsitution of Odhinn in some places), he remained a powerfulforce as a religious figure. The rune tiwaz is similar to eihwaz and elhaz in that it shows forth the central column of theworld; but where eihwaz shows melding of the lowest and the highest and elhaz shows communication,tiwaz represents the separation of the heavens and the earth. Thorsson identifies the rune tiwaz with theSaxon Irminsul the greatpillar holding up the heavens.~ Odhinn is essentially bipolar; Tyr is essentiallyunipolar, as shown by his one-handedness-a literal sign that Tyr is bound to a single course of action, asopposed to the ever- changing Odhinn.73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" The rune tiwaz is the rune of stability and ordering force. The star of the Anglo-Saxon RunePoem is probably the North Star, which always serves as an absolute indicator of direction.One of the greatest sides of tiwaz’s being is its socio-religious nature as a rune of law. Tiwaz isassociated with the Thing, the general assembly at which justice was done and community decisionsmade. tn this context, it is the complement of raidho. Elements of this may be seen in the story of theFenris-Wolf. Tyr must take the weight of dealing with the Wolf upon himself because it, as theembodiment of the forces of chaos, is chiefly his enemy at this point (it becomes Odhinn’s doom atRagnarok because the Wolf is essentially part of Odhinn’s own nature; it is the orlog he has laid forhimself). In spite of the fact that betraying the oath the gods have sworn to the Wolf is in the best interestsof all life, Tyr still must pay for the deception with his hand, as he is the god of oaths, honor, and absolutejustice. Tiwaz is the main rune used by or on behalf of those who were not themselves greatly skilled inruneword. It was usual for warriors to, as the valkyrja Sigrdrifa tells Sigurdhr, “call twice upon Tyr.”2The rune was inscribed on the hilt of the sword to instill honor and courage in the welder, and on one orboth sides of the blade to fill it with Tyr’s victorious might. Battle was seen as a judgment (from whichthe medieval trial by combat developed), and hence the use of the rune tiwaz made the warrior worthy,ensuring that he would be judged the better man and so win the fight. The rune tiwaz is used to obtain absolute justice and to strengthen a person or thing in thephysical realm by filling it with spiritual and moral force. It is, of course, called upon for victory and isone of the mightiest runes in dealing directly with earthly problems as well as magical struggles. In the personal sphere, tiwaz develops courage, strength, and honor. It makes you aware of yourduty to others, especially where the social order as a whole is concerned. Tiwaz can be used for stabilityand to bind the unruly and woe-working forces within until you have developed the strength to meld thesesides into your whole bemg (wunjo). Tiwaz is used to bring about and maintain order.In workings of woe, tiwaz instills rigidity, prejudice, and loss of perspective. It may be useddirectly against another in revenge-defense magic (casting the spear over) if the cause is truly just. Tiwaz can be used to force someone to fulfill an oath or to bind any undisciplined energy.Ritually, tiwaz is represented by the central pillar of the temple or its symbolic representation.The stones associated with tiwaz are bloodstone and hematit~both of which grant wisdom as wellas strength in battl~and ruby, which is associated with leadership and warrior might. Star ruby isespecially appropriate to this rune.Tiwaz: Meditation You are floating in what seems to be a pool of utterly formless chaos. All around you, shapes are half-pulling themselves from the restless mass and collapsing back into it, their borders flowing and engulfingeach other. Strange sounds, gratings, and grunts and sloshing noises float through this realm offormlessness and confusion. You long for something solid to rest your feet on, for more light than theshifting flashes that pulse irregularly through the sea of chaos about you, and for a clearer air than thisthick hell-brew of stinking fog and dust.Looking up, you see a single silver gleam through the seething ocean of madness. You expect itto wink out and be lost, but it glows ever more strongly, one fixed single star shining straight downthrough the shifting formlessness. As it brightens, the writhing liquid slowly solidifies to viscous mudbeneath your feet, then to solid ground, as the air clears about you. The single beam of the star hasbecome a great pillar of light, holding up the dark blue arch of the heavens above the newly-formed earth.You breathe deeply of the clear air, staring up at the star and glad of the solid ground under you. Something growls behind you. Turning to look, you see a wolf as big as a horse bounding overthe ground towards you, its teeth flashing in the starlight. It leaves a wake of eddying, shuddering chaosbehind it. At the last moment it changes course, and you see that it is about to attack the pillar that holdsthe sky up. You lookaround desperately for a weapon, but all you see is a rope at the foot of the pillar.You grab the rope and swing it at the wolf. It backs off, snarling, then charges right at you. Steppingaside, you swing the rope around its neck with one hand and grab it with the other, pulling the two endstight to choke it. Although it shakes itself mightily, flinging you about, it cannot dislodge the rope or74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"reach you with its teeth. Finally it falls to earth and you finish the task of binding its feet together and itsjaws tight shut.You still hear its low growl - impotent now, you think, until you realize that the beast has notwoken yet. The growling comes from a pair of fur-cloaked men who run across the plain at you. They biteat their shield-rims, froth running down into their beards and the wood splintering under their furiousgnawing. A spear and a sword now stand at the foot of the pillar. Without questioning the gift, you snatchup the spear and fling it at them. It takes one through the breast and he falls. The other runs towards you,howling like a wolf in his madness. You pick up the sword and step forward to fight him.When the berserker’s axe meets your sword, it flings you back and you land heavily against thepillar. He leaps forward and strikes at you again, but the might flowing into you from the faithful starabove gives you the strength to meet his blow. You fight with your back to the column for a long time,neither of you getting the upper hand. Slowly the strength of his furious madness begins to drain fromhim, though your power continues steady. At last you strike the axe from his hand. He stands staring atyou a moment his chest heaving, as if thinking whether to attack again. You could stab him through, butyou know that it is dishonorable to slay an unarmed man.The last of the berserker-strength leaves him and he slumps to the ground, unconscious. You stepaway from the pillar and raise your head and hands to the star in thanks for your victory. As you watch, atall, grim man whose golden beard spreads out over his mailed breast steps out of the pillar of light. Heholds a spear in his left hand; his right arm is a bleeding stump. Tyr nods at you, smiling, and gestures atyour sword. You hold it out flat before him. With the tip of his spear, he traces the rune tiwaz once on theblade, once on the hilt, and once on your forehead.

Old Icelandic Rune PoemI know a thirteenth: If I sprinkle a young thane I with water, he will not fall, though he goes to battle. He will not be cut down, by swords.” Havamal 158The rune berkano, “birch,” is the rune of the Great Mother, the goddess worshipped as Nerthus bythe early Germanic people, who became Holda on the continent and was split into Hel and Freyja in theNorse countries. This rune embodies the root of much of the Vanic cult: the earth goddess whose powersof fertility must be renewed by the sacrifice of her consort each year. The stave-shape for berkano may beseen as the swollen breasts and belly of a pregnant woman; it may also be seen as the mirroring andfundamentally identical enclosures of womb and tomb. As Freyja, Berkano is the source of life; as Hel,she is keeper of the dead; as the Aesic Frigg, she is the silent keeper of wisdom who “knows all orlog, Ithough she does not say so herself.”1 Looking with care, you can see that each of these goddesses bearswithin herself aspects of the others-they are all maternal, keepers of their share of the dead, and silentseeresses.Berkano is the rune of the earth who receives the sacrifice/seed and holds it within herself, guarding andnourishing it until the time has come for it to return to the worlds outside again. This is the process ofrebirth for those who do not struggle up to Valhalla.As a rune of fruitfulness, berkano particularly rules the birth- process of the spring, when the power76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"of the goddess is shown forth most openly as she brings new life from her womb. In a number ofNorthern countries it was the custom to dress a young girl in birch limbs and/or flowers and have hertravel through the village on May Day or on one of the other spring celebrations. This is probably asurvival of the goddess Nerthus’ spring procession in which the goddess was drawn about in a wain,spreading her fertile power through the land. Her power was renewed by a human sacrifice at the end ofthe journey, and students of folklore will at once be aware of a great number of folk customs which areobvious survivals of this practice.The bringing-forth in the spring is prepared for by the concealment of the fall, and it was at thistime that the folk of the Norse countries made their gifts to the land, at the festival called Winter- nights,disablot(sacrifice to the goddesses), oralfablot(sacrifice to the elves). Thedisirare lesser Vanicgoddesses, usually bound to a single family or person. They are often dead female ancestors who watchover the births and deaths of their descendants and advise or protect; they are closely related to thekinfylga and the valkyrja. They have also been described as the “attendant Norns,” “those who come toevery child that is born to shape its life.”2 These beings have survived in children’s stories as the fairiesbestowing gifts-writing weird-at a baby’s christening.As a rune of bringing-into-being, Berkano is mighty as a shaping force in itself, the thought being,as written in theProse Edda,that the layers laid at birth (coming into being) will remain powerfulthroughout life. This is also written forth in the “Havamal” passage. The sprinkling with the waters of lifeis an old pagan custom; in this case, the magical action taken is that of enclosing the child at birth in theprotection of berkano, which remains around him throughout his life because it has been written as hisorlog, his first layer of weird.Berkano is the rune of the mound itself, as apart from the initiation within the mound. It is theequivalent of the alchemist’s athanor, the oven or “womb” in which transformation takes place.Berkano may be used for female fertility magic and in working with women’s mysteries. It isparticularly mighty in all matters regarding birth and bringing-into-being.This rune is effective in reaching your disir to call on their guarding might or asking for their wiserede in some matter, as Odhinn often asks for Frigg’s.Berkano is used for concealment, protection, and nurturing, especially of children. It is a good runefor passive warding.In workings of woe, Berkano may be called upon as the rune of the goddess in her being as theGrave-Mother, the devouring bog.Berkano is the rune of hidden transformation and growth.Ritually, Berkano embodies the need for silence and the dark cloth which covers magicalimplements between use or in the process of creation. It is best for this cloth to be made of linen, as flax isclosely associated with Holda, a later German name for Nerthus.Used with other runes, berkano hides their workings until the unified result is ready to be broughtfully into being.The stone associated with berkano is jet a black fossil wood which shows the enclosing andsecretive nature of this rune. Jet is said to be used in seeing that which is concealed and in healing femaleproblems.Berkano: Meditation(after the poems of Seamus Heaney)3You are standing beside a low stone wall, overgrown by blackberry vines, the dark drops of their berrieshanging heavily down. Carefully you push the vines aside, hoisting yourself up and over the wall. On theother side you see the low-growing brown cattails and green turf of the bog, laid aside in square blackcuts where the peat-harvesters have ripped it away. The peat squishes under your feet as you pick yourway carefully through the little white bog-daisies and whispering rushes, following the jagged slabs ofgranite that show a safe path. A small, clear stream of water winds around the rocks, rising and falling asyour weight shifts. The ground here is soft, betraying. The little spring runs into a silent black pool likethe mouth of a sacrificial cauldron open to the gray sky. Here and there the green moss is stained brown77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"and ochre, stains like ancient blood held in the bog, fermenting below the earth. The seeds and leaves fallfrom the bog-plants, rotting into the earth they sprang from, layered into the thousands of years that liesilent here.By a low, moss-bearded heap of stones, just off the path, you see a green hump. You crouch downand reach out to touch it. The moss comes off in your fingers, showing the peat-stained wooden handleand rust-browned blade of a turfdigger’s shovel. As you pick it up, the mud that held it splits and openssoftly - a tawny rut spreading in the bog. You sink the blade and shaft of the shovel back into the hole andthe bog slowly swallows it. The cattails around the cairn tremble. Slowly, as you watch, a tall stick, darkfrom years of lying beneath the peaty waters of the bog, slowly comes forth. It is forked some way down,the cleft carved in more deeply so that in its dark, slender shadow you see the echo of a tall, long-leggedwoman’s shape. You stand silent for a moment, gazing at the shadow of the hidden goddess of this place.Slowly you step from the path towards the cleft stave. Your feet sink deeply into the sucking bogthat pulls you down into her womb, your tomb. Although you struggle, you cannot break free from hergrasp. The cold mud rises past your legs, swallowing you in. A strange, still peace comes over you andyou let yourself sink deep into the welcoming peat.As the dark bog closes over your head and your breath stills, you feel yourself melting intosomeone else, into the body that lies just beneath you, kept by the peaty waters for hundreds of years. Thewoman has lain, clad for her marriage, in this water and earth, pinned down by the oaken stake that wedher to the bog so long ago. You feel her long sleep here, beneath turf, beneath the cairn and the stonewall. Dead, you feel the seeping waters working into your skin, darkening it with peat, tanning it tounrotting leather. The hoard of life guarded within your pelvis shrinks, preserved like the roots and grainsthat lie in your stomach; your breasts wrinkle where the soft linen and fur lie over them. A thousanddawns warm you slowly, a thousand nights cool you where you lie beneath, where the grip of sun andsnow cannot reach. Your brain darkens in sleep, its hoard fermenting slowly in your peat-stained skull,nestled in the dark coils of your hair, beneath the golden circlet whose jewels have dropped, one by one,from their settings. Held within the bog’s endless darkness, softness, your body is slowly changed, skindark and grained as bog oak, everlasting as amber and jet.Another winter passes, cold and slow, and again the new sun begins to warm all of the bog slowly,setting some of the seeds within to ferment and sprout. You, too, feel its stirring, rising up from the stillbody in the bog, through the black peat and slowly out into the brilliance of the sun. A birch tree standsabove you, and the dark pool before you reflects your image like a mirror. You are a young, golden-haired maiden clad all in birch leaves and flowers. Where you stretch out your arm, the bog1 brown fromwinter, sprouts into a mist of green. You pass through it, your little bare feet springing lightly over thebetraying turf and hidden pools as you spread the new life you have brought forth over the land.When you have completed your round of the bog, you stop again before the slender, dark, cleft forkof the goddess. A few drops of bright water spring forth from the top of the stick, landing on your head inblessing as you bow respectfully to her.Slowly you return to your own body, feet firmly planted on the earth, knowing the power ofconcealment and birth that is always yours through the rune berkano.78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"EHWAZGaldr-sound: aaaaayyyyyy (prolonged sound, as in “day”)Letter: E(Horse) is, in front ofthe earls the joy of athlings, a charger proud on its hooves; when concerning it, heroes-wealthy men-on warhorsesexchange speech and it is always a comfort to the restless.Anglo-Saxon Rune PoemThe horse is the most magical and honored animal in the Teutonic tradition, melding the power of godlywisdom with the earthly might of fertility and the power of bearing the soul from world to world. It isclosely identified with the cult of the Twin Gods or Alcis among the Germanic tribes, a pair of deitieswhom Tacitus described as close analogies to Castor and Pollux; in fact, the stave-shape of the rune isvery like the crossbeam which was the sign of the worship of the Twins among the Spartans. It may alsorepresent a pair of horsemen riding joined together, which was a part of the worship of the Alcis amongthe Germanji. This is probably related to the Germanic dual kingship: A number of Germanic royalhouses traced their ancestry back to a pair of royal brothers or twins, and the practice remained in usethrough the Saxon invasion of Britain, which was led by two brother-kings named Hengest (stallion) andHorsa (horse). An echo from this root can be seen further north in the prelude to the Eddic lay“Grimnismal” in which, however, Geirroedh dispossessed his brother and co-heir early.The Alcis are also etymologically tied to the rune ehwaz through its alternatename - algiz,or“protection.” In this you may see the working of ehwaz as a rune of receiving prophetic wisdom. As asacred animal, the horse, like the valkyrja, was capable of communicating between gods and humans, andin fact was so used in the divination of one Germanic tribe.Ehwaz is the rune of the “fetch” or fylgja: that part of the being which appears as a beast showingthe inner nature of the person it serves and which may be ridden between the worlds. Like the valkyrja,the fetch can receive and transmit wisdom which is not otherwise available to the vitki’s mind. Unlikeher, it can be controlled and used by the vitki. The most common forms of the fetch seem to be the bear,stag, and wolf; but mice, whales, dragons, and even thursar and troll-women have been written of. Thefetch is in a sense the “totem animal” of the vitki, although it is actually more of a guardian spirit. It canbe sent forth separately or ridden. This is discussed further in the chapters on the soul and seidhr-magic.The horse is particularly sacred both to Odhinn and to Freyr, the Lord of Wisdom and the Lord ofthe World respectively. Hence, the rune ehwaz is very fitting for uniting mystical inspiration with earthlybeing. In this rune, you may read the mysteries of the alliance between the Hidden One and the Lord.Ehwaz is used in all matters concerning the harmonious union of dualities, either in the manner ofequals, as in the dual kingship, or in the manner of guiding intelligence and manifesting might, as with thehuman/horse and god/human dualities. As the bonder of equals, it may be used in all matters of friendshipand marriage. It is useful in forming ties between two people on all levels, including private telepathicand empathic linkages. It may be useful as an aid to sympathetic magic.79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Ehwaz is a good rune of fertility, especially in those forms of fertility magic where conception isdesired for a magical purpose or to bind a certain being or power to the fetus or newborn.Ehwaz brings power under the guidance of wisdom. In workings of woe, ehwaz may be used toenslave another person’s might or thought to your own will.Ehwaz may be used in religious divinations for the purpose of understanding the will of the gods.Comparison with the relationship between god and human in santeria may be valuable -the personpossessed is called the horse, the possessing spirit the rider. It is also said that “a great god cannot ride alittle horse,” words of caution which you might be wise to heed in opening your mind.In ritual use, ehwaz is used in relationship to the fetch and, together with the other runes of travel,for faring between the worlds.This is the rune to use in creating and dealing with thought- forms and other conscious or sentientextensions of your own power.Ehwaz is effective in building up a rapport with any vehicle of motion, whether living or ~ magicalor mechanical.Used with other runes, ehwaz unites the streams of power in a manner opposite to that of thurisaz.Where thurisaz creates reactive force for the purpose of breaking, ehwaz creates active force by meldingfor the purpose of integration. You must not forget however, that ehwaz is an essentially mobile energy.The stones associated with ehwaz are turquoise, which builds up the rapport between horse andrider, and sardonyx, which is said to ensure a faithful marriage.Ehwaz: MeditationYou stand in the middle of a grove of oak and ash trees at sunrise, the new light coming brightly throughthe leaves that move in a gentle breeze. A little way ahead of you, you see a great white horse grazingquietly. It wears a golden saddle and trappings of gold and turquoise.As you walk nearer to the horse, it looks up and you see the wisdom of the gods in its great darkeyes. It stands gazing at you silently for a moment, then lowers its head and scrapes its right forefootthrough the dewy grass. You sense that the horse wants you to mount and this you do as it stands quietly.Mounted on the horse, you are filled with a great feeling of the strength beneath you as its powerfulmuscles move it into a trot. You guide it out of the sacred grove with only a little push from your knees;although you hold the reins very loosely in your hands, you know that the horse’s might is bonded to yourwill.You ride out into a wide, grassy field where wildflowers grow thickly, rich with color. Lookingahead, you see another person on a white horse riding towards you. In the sharp light of the risen sun, yousee your own image and wonder how the whole plain could be spanned by a mirror, until the other pullsout a rope and you realize that this is your own double riding towards you.Your twin uncoils the rope and tosses one end over to you. You catch it and fasten it around yourwaist. No words are needed between you - you ride bound together, matching each other move for moveand step for step as you urge your steeds into a gallop. As you race, the rope between you becomesshorter and shorter until you are almost touching, yoked so closely that a misstep by either of your horseswould bring you both down. You breathe together, your horses’ hooves striking the ground in perfect stepand the sharp puffing of their breath so close together that you cannot tell which is which.Slowly your double and your mount’s merge into you until it seems that you ride alone again. Youtravel from the field up the side of a mountain, directing your horse over the treacherous, rocky trails. Ithas an uncanny balance and gait often stepping around pitfalls that you do not see until afterward.Although you are guiding it always upward, you give it enough freedom to let it choose among the pathsthat it seems to know better than you do.The weather is growing colder, clouds passing across the young sun. You climb through patches ofthick white mist on your way up the mountain.

Mannus was the sonof Tvisto, who had sprung up from the earth, and the father of the three races of humanity (slaves, thefreeborn, and the noble), The same story is told of the Celtic Mannan mac Lir and of Agni in the RigVeda. In the Norse legends, the place of Mannus is taken by Heimdallr under the name Rigr, which is theCeltic title meaning “king.” Whether the story was passed from the Irish to the Norse or grewindependently from Indo-European roots, it still tells the tale of humanity’s descent from the gods as wellas from earth (“the increase of dust,” as mentioned under elhaz). As the warder of Bifrost Heimdallr isalso the linker of humans and the gods, both genetically and consciously, as described in the Rigsthula.After Heimdallr has fathered the three races of men, he returns to teach Earl, first of the line of nobles,and to show him the way to conquer his inheritance. In Germanic mystical tales, the reference to nobilityis a code speaking of those people who are able to awaken and use the might within themselves. Thus itwas written that “Walking Rigr came, taught him the runes / and granted his own name, saying itbelonged to his son. / Rigr bade him take possession of Udal Vales and old halls... He rode forth on hishorse, swung his sword... fought for land,” “He contended in runes with Earl Rigr. / He battled him inwits, and knew the runes better. / So he came to have for himself / the name Rigr and runelore.”2 The keyto this inheritance is the power of the mind, especially as shown through the runes. Note that Rigr’s trueheir in the second generation is not the first of Earl’s sons, but Kon, the youngest. This is an inheritancethat can only be won by those who are worthy.Mannaz is the rune of the rational mind, of the intelligence which is the greatest might of humanbeings. It shows the interaction of Huginn and Muninn, or Hoenir and Mimir, both embodiments of thefaculties ofhugr,“thought” andminni,“memory,” left brain and right brain respectively.3 Mannaz is therune of the perfected intellect which melds reason and intuition. As the rune of consciousness, it isparticularly associated with Mimir, odhinn’s maternal uncle and teacher, and in particular with the storyof Mimir’s severed head. The tale of Odhinn preserving the head with herbs and spells and getting redesfrom it in his hours of need is actually a hint towards a ritual of reaching and learning from your “race-memory,” the transmitted wisdom of your ancestors. In this aspect mannaz is closely related to othala, ashinted by the reference to the “udal lands” (entailed by primogeniture) in the Rigsthula.82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The god Heimdallr is, in one sense, the ordering and weal- working side of Odhinn’s being as All-Father and teacher, as set against Heimdallr’s foe Loki, the embodiment of Odhinn’s capricious and woe-working nature. Heimdallr is spoken of as highest- minded and brightest of the gods.4 He may be likenedto the ever- watchful eagle at Yggdrasill’s crown, and Loki to the ever-gnawing serpents at its roots -Odhinn, of course, melding the mights of both. Mannaz is the rune of this high-mindedness, emphasizingthe highest elements in the human nature as the goal and source of the vitki’s self-knowledge and self-control.Mannaz is used in all matters of the mind, both in strengthening intelligence and memory and inawakening and guiding the force of psychic abilities.This rune makes you more aware of the hallowed inheritance you share with the rest of the humanrace and brings you into relationships with other wights who not only partake of this kinship but also haveactively taken it up and are setting out to claim its full might.In workings of woe, mannaz can bring a sense of being “chosen” or somehow better than otherbeings simply by the fact of birth or potential power. You must remember that although the “myth ofinheritance” is always ultimately true, it is an inheritance in which all humans can potentially share.In ritual workings mannaz is the rune of the vitki her/himself. Mannaz represents the perfect humanbeing, balanced and self- guided with a full knowledge of the workings of his/her own mind-for only aperson who is in complete control of her/himself can work magic successfully, especially the magic of therunes, which depends so greatly on the shape given it by the spoken galdr as well as on the runesthemselves. Without full and complete self- knowledge, the subconscious will twist your workings tofulfill drives that may lead to self-destruction as easily as success.Used with other runes, mannaz guides their workings into the realm of the mind or, at need, toaffect the brain.The stone associated with mannaz is amethyst, which of all stones is traditionally the mostpowerful concerning reason, memory/intuition, and the capability to effectively meld the two. It bringsclearness of mind and aids in the guidance of passion by reason. Its name means “without drunkenness”(Greek), and it shows its might as a moderator and balance~ which is among the best of wisdoms,according to the “Havamal,” and well shown forth in the nature of Heimdallr. Amethyst is a sky-orientedstone, fitting for this rune whose stave-shape shows the marriage of heaven and earth.5Mannaz: MeditationYou stand in a dark cave by a stone well. Drops of moisture drip from the tree-roots writhingthrough the cave’s walls. A faint white light glows from a ledge at the rim of the well.As your eyes grow used to the dark, you see the low-browed, broad-skulled head of Mimir on the ledge,his white beard stained with streaks of brownish red and white hair faintly discolored by madder andother preservative herbs. His withered eyelids are closed. A circle glows faintly around the head, aninterwoven pattern of bind-runes written within. The only one you can make out clearly is the runemannaz on the outer border of the circle.You draw a small knife from your belt and prick your forefinger with the point. As the blood wells,you trace over the rune with it, intoning the rune-name mannaz.

In the Teutonk cosmos, it is the water flowing up through the well itself, as distinct from the well(perthro) or the path and action of the water (uruz). Laguz is essentially an undifferentiated force whichuruz cleanses, shapes, and guides.You can see this dual nature in the great ambivalence with which the Germanic peoples viewedthe waters of their world. Water is the bright waters of life and the dark waters of death. The ocean was agreat source of the Norse people’s prosperity and their easiest road to travel (Njord), but it was also the85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"greedy devourer of ships and men (Ran) which only one skilled in magic could protect against. Althoughthe rivers and streams were, quite literally, the waters of life for those who dwelt near them and could notlive without them, the Germanic people have more tales of ill-meaning wights in the waterways theydepended on than any other people.The most famous of these, of course1 is die Lorelei on the Rhine, lurmg sailors to their deaths;but her sisters inhabit almost every stream and marsh of the North.Standing water where venom collects and ferments was thought of as much more dangerous thanrunning water, which was active, life-holding, and holy. Grendel and his mother are good examples of thewoe-working powers of laguz as it represents the festering subconscious, Grendel is the chronic symptomof the monster-brood hidden beneath the waters of the pool. When he is slain above water (the symptomis suppressed), his mother wreaks a slaughter several times worse than his had been. Only when Beowulf,whose heroic reputation has been grounded on his abilities as a swimmer, goes down into the pond andslays Grendel’s dam in her home do the killings cease. This tale shows the need for the mage to be able tofind hidden sources of woe and deal with them in the layer at which the woe was written-able to farethrough the lightless waters of the subconscious and the hidden worlds in which magic works alike.Laguz is the rune by which you may search back through the layers of that-which-is and move through itsstructure at will to read orlog.As well as being a rune of concealment and the unknown, laguz is a rune by which life is broughtforth from darkness and the hidden is brought forth into the light. It is the “waters of life” which aresprinkled on the newborn child if it was not to be left to die, in order to show its acceptance in the circleof the living. It is also a rune which shows and/or combats poison. The alternate form of the rune’s name,laukaz,means “leek,” and this is the rune to which Sigrdrifa refers when she tells Sigurdhr, “You shallsign a blessed drink with these to ward against danger, / and put a leek in the brew. / Then, I know, yourmead will never be blent with harm.”‘ The working of the rune in this manner is shown in the saga ofEgill Skallagrimsson who, suspecting poison in a drink that had been given to him, scratched a runeseveral times on his horn, stabbed the palm of his hand, and reddened the runes with blood, whereuponthe horn burst asunder-as a result of the sudden inflowing of life- force and yeast acting on the venom-andthe drink fell out onto the straw. All the plants of the allium family, including onion and garlic, show theworking and nature of laguz: while the bulb stays hidden, the great life-force in it shows itself by the swiftupward growth of the green stalk, and all of these plants are powerful strengtheners in both the physicalworld and the hidden realms.Laguz is a rune of the transitions between life and death-the awakener at life’s beginning and thewater to be crossed at its end. You should remember that Odhinn often appears as a ferryman to claim thedead.Laguz is used to fill yourself with life-force and to send that force from world to world. It makesyour sensitivity to shifts in the flows of power around you greater, especially when hints of danger maybe felt. This sensitivity may also be applied to the magnetic fields of the earth.Laguz is used to probe the subconscious and the unknown, and mastery of this rune is needed todeal with the problems you find in the realms it governs.In workings of woe, laguz is the rune of seduction, deception, illness, and poison. It may be usedto worsen chronic health problems and cause longstanding problems of all kinds to surface.Ritually, laguz represents the mead or ale used in rites. It rules all magics of brewing anddrinking. It is also seen in the magical use of spittle and blood, the body fluids which carry the life-force.In the personal sphere, laguz may be called upon for physical and magical strength andpsychological insight. It is the complement of the conscious mind, mannaz.Laguz brings out the effects of past workings.Used with other runes, laguz is a strengthener; it may be used in sending runes between worlds. Ifyou wish, you can use it either to set runes to work in secret or to bring them up from their root in thehidden realms of being.A stone that works well with laguz is malachite, whose alternating bands of dark and light greenshow the twofold being of this rune. Malachite is filled with powerful life-force, a healer with might thatflows like the wave. Its layered structure also shows its nature within the Well of Wyrd, a hint towards theuse of this rune for sinking to the point of origin and claiming the power flowing from your roots.86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Laguz: MeditationYou stand at the bottom of a great waterfall, white spray splashing up into your face from the churningriver. A little green boat is tied to the drooping branches of a willow tree on the bank, tugging against therope in the grip of the current. You step into the boat cutting the rope loose and taking up the oars as yourcraft skims swiftly downriver, jerking this way and that as you skillfully guide it among the rocks thatwhip the water into white froth. You sense rather than see the sharp edges below the surface of the water,pushing your boat away from the hidden boulders that could tear its bottom out at any moment.After a while, the water deepens and you move smoothly along with the current down through thetwisting of the river through the high, craggy mountains above. You pass through a region of vineyardsand rich farmlands along the side of the great hills, watered by the streams that flow down from the topsof their peaks to feed the river. Although the water you ride on is dark, every now and then you can seethe glint of gold in its depths, and the pale flashing of fish.High above the sounds of the river, you hear the faint crystal sound of a woman’s voice singingwordlessly. You strain to hear it more closely, but it is cut off as the river turns around the curve of amountain’s foot. When you have rounded the mountain, you hear the voice again, clearer and morecompelling, like the sweet voice of a silver bell rippling over the water in shimmering waves of sound.Entranced, you let your oars fall, drifting closer to the hidden singer as the river runs along. You roundone last curve and see her sitting on a rock in the shallow backwaters, her legs hidden beneath the ripplingstream. She wears a wet, loosely woven green dress which is half-slipping off one shoulder; long blackhair streams around her face and down her back.

Half-entranced still, you put your oars into the water to steer around the peril and strike hardagainst a jagged line of rocks that would have shredded your boat in a few seconds. Looking hard at thedark water beyond, you see that the river runs deep and hard around the maiden’s rock; if you hadfollowed her call any farther, you would have been drowned. She stops singing, rising up on her rock.Instead of legs, she has the black, scaly tail of a great fish, dripping with moss and waterweed. Her mouthopens in a snarl of anger and you see the sharp layers of a shark’s teeth within. Hastily you shove out intothe main current and let it carry you away from her. You glance back anxiously to see if she has slippedinto the water behind you, but she is waiting for her next meal, tail hidden beneath the river and delicatelips curved in a sweet, melancholy smile.As you move along, the earth about you begins to shake, the tremors rocking your boat. You steeras close to the middle of the river as you can. Slowly the earthquake dies down, but the ruins of afarmhouse to your left tells you that the land has suffered much worse, and not long ago: the brokenbricks are freshly whitewashed, and the pool of blood to one side of the rubble is not completely dry.The river runs along swiftly, cutting through high, wave-eaten sandstone cliffs to flow out into theocean. Behind you, you hear a deep rumbling. Looking back, you see the land beginning to shake again,moving more violently until one of the bluffs collapses into a great slide of sand, cracking away in hugechunks that shatter on the beach or topple into the ocean. The high waves catch your little boat and fling itabout until something lifts it into the air from beneath, turning it over and casting you into the cold, darksalt water.

You sense a threat and swim deeper,letting the darkness of the water hide you. There are more shapes below, nine water-nicors twice the sizeof a man but roughly man-shaped, finned and dark- scaled with heads that round into thick ridges of bonerunning from their eyesockets across the tops of their skulls.

The rune poem may refer to the spring pro- cession of Nerthus in the wagon. As describedby Tacitus, and in the Norse equivalents of this procession, the mortal consort of the deity rode in orahead of the wagon carrying the god’s statue, and it is plausible that what is described here is Nerthus’consort mg riding ahead until the goddess’ return to the sacred island, when he might very well be slain.The god mg, of course, would be re-embodied in each year’s male sacrifice, and during the days of theprocession the incarnation of the god would be encouraged to impregnate as many women as he could.This may be the source of the beliefs of many of the Germanic royal houses that they were descendedfrom mg or Freyr; their ancestors had indeed been fathered by the god dwelling in the body of a man.This may be seen as a Vanic likeness to the ideas shown by the Rigsthula and the rune mannaz - mannazunites the divine descendant with the heavens and spiritual wisdom of the Aesir, ingwaz unites her/himwith the earth and the nature-wisdom of the Vanir.The stave-shape of ingwaz may show either the castrated male or the seed: both are appropriate tothe rune, as the feminine principle receives the life-force of the masculine principle through both bloodand seed, then holds it through gestation and brings it forth into being. This is written of in the story ofFreyr and Gerdhr: to win the maiden, Freyr must give up his horse-the symbol of phallic fertility in Vanicntuals~and his sword, the symbolism of which is obvious. One of the names of Odhinn is also Jalkr, or“Gelding.” This may refer to Odhinn’s initiation into the art of seidhr-magic, which, along with some ofthe Vanic rites of worship, were considered by the general Norse public to be “unmanly.” The reason forthis was that to assume the feminine powers of vision and understanding or to give himself up wholly tothe feminine principle, a man had to be capable of entirely giving up his masculine identity, even to thepoint of dressing and living as a woman for a time-a practice common to many forms of shamanism, andsomething which Odhinn is implied to have done in his practice of seidhr-magic, as well as somethingdone frequently by his trickster-aspect, Loki. In this manner a man can create in the realms of spirit as awoman does in the earthly world. This is the magic by which the horse Sleipnir, a major vehicle ofOdhinn’s power, was conceived and born by Loki in the shape of a mare. Ingwaz is the gateway by whicha man can achieve a full understanding of the mysteries of women. The true vitki is, like Odhinn, bothwholly bipolar and even hermaphroditic.Ingwaz is the rune by which power is stored, a gateway to the hidden realms.

In this case you will need to re-color or chant ingwaz aftereach use, in order to return the active might to its potential state.The stone of ingwaz is ivory, which is essentially masculine but which is said to enable spiritual self-sacrifice, showing forth the way in which ingwaz combines virility and passivity.Ingwaz: MeditationYou stand at the outskirts of a small farming village, just within sight of the little thatched cottagesamong the muddy fields.

She is dressed only in birch branches and flowers, her long brown hair rippling down over her half-hidden breasts. The wagon stops as the Lord drops his breeches and takes her in full view of the town ashis stallion mounts the wagon’s mare. Should she bear a child of the god, it will be a sure sign of hislingering blessing. At first she is frightened and shy, but as the grasses sprout around her in the wave ofmight from Nerthus’ wagon and the strength of the god fills her, she cries out in her joy.Ing remounts his satisfied stallion and the godly procession rides onward, Ing before the wagon anda riderless mare behind it.

The Norse counted the twenty-four-hour period by nights and measured it by thesolarliringar(seeraidho) which was divided into two “days” - sunrise to sunset and sunset to sunrise. Hence the idea of“day” holds the idea of transition between the time of light and the time of darkness. This thought is alsoshown in the story of the birth of Day in theProse Edda.Night was the dark daughter of a giant calledNorfi. Her first marriage was with a chthonic being named Naglfari (ship of the dead) by whom she borea son named Audh (“the wealthy”; fitting when you think of the association of the world beneath theearth’s surface with treasure). She was next married to Annar (“The Second”), whom other referenceshint was Odhinn in one of his many disguises. Their daughter was Jord, the Earth, the mother of many ofthe gods and goddesses including Thor and Frigg. Her last mate was Delling (“the Shining One”) whofathered Day on her, after which both Night and Day were set to ride through the sky, Night on the horseHrimfaxi (Frostymane) and Day on the horse Skinfaxi (Shining Mane), This progressive synthesis whkhleads from the chthonic to the heavenly realms shows the waxing power of synthesis. Night’s firsthusband is of a nature not far removed from her own giantish heritage. Her second husband, Odhinn, ismore of an opposite and hence their child is higher and more powerful than the first. Delling is Night’sexact polar opposite, and their union not only creates the transcendent being Day but ‘Hi the originalparticipants to the same level of transcendence.Dagaz is the completion of the processes of gebo and elhaz. The synergy gained by the activeexchange of energies shown in gebo - the “alchemical marriage” - reaches its transcendent substance indagaz. This rune may fairly be compared to the spiritual philosopher’s stone. In sexual alchemy, dagaz isthe moment of orgasm in which the goal of the working is made real. As the completion of elhaz – themoment of unity with the valkyrja and the higher realms- dagaz is written out in thc Sigrdrifumal inwhich Sigurdhr must pass through the barrier which is described variously as a fire and a wall of shields(elhaz) to awaken his valkyrja Sigrdrifa, whereupon she chants the “Hail to day.”1Dagaz is the rune of the achievement of transcendent consciousness, in which the participantbecomes one with the universe in a flash of blinding awareness. It is the moment of awakening, theeternal moment of being reached through Hegel’s process of thesis - antithesis-synthesis.Dagaz is chiefly useful as a rune of meditation. It transforms consciousness and being on all levels.Magically, dagaz can be used to bring something to completion, particularly in the settingsdescribed above. It is useful in all workings of an “alchemical” type, whether they be practical or solelyconcerned with consciousness.Ritually, dagaz represents the moment of power at sunrise and sunset.92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Used with other runes, dagaz synthesizes their might into a single transcendent awareness.

This boundary naturally came to define the land whichcould be inherited, and in due course, kinship, social position, and even law and custom. For example,othala establishes the degrees of relationship within which one might avenge a wrongagainst a clanmember by killing or claiming money from the offender.1 The boundaries of law were clearly defined inalmost every case, and usually this was according to inheritance and birth. Although the Teutonic peoplewere not awed by noble or royal parentage, there was a strong distinction made between those born offree parents, those born of bondservants, and those born of thralls. Exceptions came in the cases of thoseborn of unwed free persons or certain types of mixed-class unions in which the father, if the kin agreed,was required to hold a rite of adoption to bring the child within the boundaries of the kin. Also when achild of any social class was weak or deformed, it was not slain outright but rather, b& mg unworthy ofthe support of the clan, was left outside the boundaries of its land - circumstances under which even anadult could hardly survive, as seen by the high degree of severity attached to the punishment of outlawry.The Norse were no harsher in this respect than any other people of their time, and far less so than theSpartans, for instance; however, their circumstances were such that they could not afford to support adrain on their resources. It was considered that the child did not have a soul until the ninth day, and wasthus not entirely human. The naming ceremony bound the soul to the child and brought it within the circleof a clan, after which exposure would be seen as murder.As the rune of inheritance, othala rules not only the bounds of the clan itself but also the mysteriesof inherited power. This rune is tied to the wisdom of thekinjylgja,a guardian power who bears are-semblance to the fylgja, the valkyrja and the disir. The kinfylga is a feminine personification of aparticular family’s might who usually attaches herself to the head of the clan, although at times she willpass to a younger member who is better fit to wield her might. Othala rules both that might which isinherited from the genetic ancestors and that which is inherited from the ~ancestors” of the spirit-that is,your previous existences. Either, or both if they are harmonious, may be the determinant of the nature ofyour personal power. In the end, this leads back to the “udal lands” of the Risgthula-the divine inheritanceshown in mannaz. This is the rune of Odhinn’s might as Allfather: by his inheritance of the might of bothjotuns and gods, he has become identified with the roots of power for every living being. His assumptionof this heritage makes him the fit leader of every clan.Although othala is an enclosure, it is not an isolated enclosure. It may be gainfully increasedthrough the powers of gebo expressed as marriage, as the giving of hostages, or as the relationshipbetween ring-giver and warrior, although the ties of inherited blood usually prove to be stronger than thelegal inclusion within the clan.94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"As the final rune and completion of the futhark, othala holds all the runes; the power of the runes isour own mystical heritage.The rune othala is used to strengthen the ties of clan, especially those which relate to familycustoms and practices.

It is particularly useful here in conjunction with mannaz and ansuz (mark thenumerical correspondence also). It may be used to gain an earthly inheritance in cases of legal questions,or to bring you back to the homeland of your ancestors and roots into family history.Othala is used to gain wealth in the form of possessions and immobile property, as set against themobile wealth of fehu. It also protects that which you rightfully own.Othala shows both inclusion and exclusion; in workings ofwoe, it may in certain combinations andsettings be used to cast an individual out beyond its borders, the borders of human society. It may alsocreate a sense of racial or cultural prejudice. The vitki working with this rune must always be careful notto let her/himself be bound by it!In ritual workings, othala shows the circle or ritual enclosure. The outer circle is the ordinary spaceof society (Midgardhr); the circle of the vitki is the holy circle, corresponding to Asgardhr. It also showsthe mysteries of the ancestors and the blood-and-soil of the homeland as the truth held in all the beliefsabout “native earth.”Used with other runes, othala defines their sphere of working, particularly in those cases where thematter at hand is a boundary of some kind-magical, social, or physical. It is good as a part of wardings. Itmay also be used well in meditations to learn more of your past.A stone which works well with othala is petrified wood, which is particularly known for itscapability to bring out the memories and talents of past lives, and which can also be used to awaken theslumbering dragon of ancestral might.Othala: MeditationYou stand outside, in a valley, at sunset, inside a fence which encloses a wide diamond-shaped yardaround a house. You recognize this house as your childhood home, set alone in this bit of fertile landsurrounded by high, rocky mountains. You begin to walk the long stretch of the fence around the field,tools in your hand to repair any breaks in it you might find.The sky darkens quickly when the sun has sunk behind the dark mountain peaks. The wind fromthe heights moans and howls eerily, sweeping down through the rocks in a whispering blast of cold. Asthe night settles into windy blackness, you see that the fence is beginning to glow with a faint goldenlight. You sense that wild things are moving beyond its border. You can just see the shadows of theirmisshapen forms.One of the wild things lopes up to the fence, moving now on four legs, now on two, lifting its faceup to sniff at the boundary. It seems to be a manlike wolf or wolflike man, with flat face and long limbscovered with coarse gray hair. The wolf-creature howls, a mournful, desperate sound that sets the hairsprickling up on your arms and down your back, and runs back into the night. You know that you haveseen avargr,an outlaw, cursed to live as a wolf beyond the bounds of kin and clan, and shudder in bothpity and revulsion.Finally you have completed your rounds of the fence. Certain that nothing can break through it,you enter your house. Your family is eating dinner inside; it is warm and bright, and you are glad to jointhem.As you eat, you see a faint brightness out of the corner of your eye. You turn your head and see therune othala in bright gold upon the floor. Inside it stands a woman in golden robes.

Structuralrelationships are those determined by placement in the futhark order, including division into aettir,Schneider’s “futhark pattern of manifestation,” = and all relationships discovered through number.Conceptual relationships are those in which the basic idea of a rune is closely tied to the basic idea ofanother, either overtly through name and references in the Rune Poems or through linkages of nature andfunction.Because of the manner in which all of the runes are woven together, one may, and should try to,find an endless number of ties between them. One may see here a model of the universe as a whole and ofthe human mind at work, keeping in mind that even the most contorted chain of logic will come up withtruth when working to prove something true-in this case, the dependence of every part of the universe onevery other part and the infinite web of connections between them. One may observe how well theQabalists have done by the use of gematria (numerical calculations in which each Hebrew letter isassigned a number and words of the same value are assumed to be equivalent in nature) . . . or even bydiscovering Qabalistic truths in the rhymes of Mother Goose.2 Although the latter may sound exceedinglysilly, the discipline of looking into everything-no matter how frivolous or ordinary-to see the workings ofthe runes is an excellent form of meditation, strengthening both one’s capabilities to use the runespractically and one’s ability to read the cast runes aright.STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPSThe greatest complex of structural relationships, which was the best-known of traditional (pre-Christian)runic theory, is the division of the futhark intoaettir-acurious term which may mean either “eights” or“families.” This term is also used for the eight divisions of the compass and their winds. The division ofthe futhark into aettir was retained even after it was reduced to the Younger form and no longer made upof three literal “eights.”The firstaettis formed of the essential elements and abilities which the vitki must have developedwithin her/himself: magical force (fehu), vital shaping power (uruz), dynamic/active force (thurisaz),inspiration and galdr-skill (ansuz), rhythm and timing (raidho), control of energies and skill to aaft them(kenaz), the ability to give and receive power (gebo), and self-confidence in an integrated personality(wunjo). This is called Freyja’s aett because it be- gins with the first rune of her name and is largelydefined by the runes associated with her, beginning with the basic energy of fehu and continuing with theability to control, form, and use the power in Midgardhr and the immediately surrounding worlds in<which the might of Freyr and Freyja mainly works.The second aett is alternately called Hagal’s aett and Heimdall’s aett. (* Schneider proposes anunknown god Hagal, possibly associated with the creation of the world, as an explanation for some of themysteries of hagalaz; there is no reference to this being in any other source.) This aett holds withir’ itselfthe runes writing forth the shape of the cosmos, those being also the runes of the vitki’s initiation into thehigher levels of consciousness. It begins with the wholeness of the universe’s structure (hagalaz) andcontinues through testing to awaken the inner fire (nauthiz), primal ice and the bridge of consciousness(isa), the cycles of the year and the growth of the seeds of power within the vitki (jera), the vertical trunkof Yggdrasill and the initiation by ordeal (eihwaz), the Well of Wyrd and the vitki’s ability to understandand use its power, the yew-tree/Bifrost bridge and the communication between vitid and valkyija, and thewheel of the sun and the vitki’s magical will (sowilo). Both the hailstone (hagalaz) and Heimdallr arefining in naming this aeft, the one marking it as the aett of cosmological structure, the other as the aett ofrising awareness and expanding consciousness, as Heimdallr, the guardian of the bridge, also hearseverything that happens in the Nine Worlds.The third aett is called the aett of Tiwaz because of the rune that begins it: the spear is the emblemof Tyr in his oldest aspect as Sky-Father, and it is this aspect to which the aett-name refers esoterically.97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"For this reason some moderns have chosen to rename this the aett of Odhinn, as appropriate to his laterstatus and the character of this aett as the aett of the gods and the fully initiated vitki. Tiwaz is the Sky-Father/victory rune; berkano the Great Mother, birth, and death; ehwaz the Twin Gods and kings; mannazthe godly might of men, laguz the power over life and hidden sources; ingwaz is Yngvi-Freyr and thegod’s sacrifice; dagaz the rune of transcendent completion; and othala the inheritance that encompassesall.Within the aett-structure are the eight triads formed by the division of the futhark into aettir. Thesecombinations often prove to be among the most practical of structural relationships in runic workings.Meditating on their interrelationships is a most valuable source of insight into the more hidden sides anduses of each rune.

For instance, in a rite to draw on the wisdom of one’s ancestors, you might take intoaccount that numerically mannaz (20) holds within itself the powers of ansuz (4) multiplied by raidho (5),both of which are also structurally and conceptually tied to mannaz and hence will greatly enhance itsworkings; further, mannaz (20) plus ansuz (4) equals othala (24), which is obvious in this context.Needless to say, this will work better in some things than in others. The art of the vitki consists, amongother things, in being able to tell which method of association is most effective under whichcircumstances. Regular experimental meditations are good for this purpose, and various numericalpatterns may offer a guide to beginning these meditations.CONCEPTUAL RELATIONSHIPSConceptual relationships are, by their nature, harder to classify than structural relationships; however,they turn out many times to be somewhat easier to work with. When one has seen the process ofidentifying conceptual relationships by different means, one should quickly be able to find a host ofcorrespondences and build up one’s personal work with them on one’s own.Perhaps the most obvious of conceptual relationships are those which fall into clear elementalcategories. Among the fire runes are fehu, kenaz, nauthiz, eihwaz, and elhaz; fehu may be used tostrengthen the working of any of the others. The runes of ice are isa and hagalaz. In the category of waterare laguz, perthro, and uruz, the relationship between which has been discussed at length. Ansuz andtiwaz (as the Sky-Father) are the runes of air. The runes of earth are berkano, ingwaz, jera, and othala.Outside of these categories, the remaining runes are those that show the interactions between theelemental powers. Indeed, all the runes do this to some extent, being different aspects of the primal forcesworking through the universe; but a distinction can be made between the runes that clearly characterize asingle element and the runes of synthesis.The rune poems are also a good guide to conceptual relationships: sowilo’s use in guiding one overthe sea as written forth in the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem clearly shows it as an answer to the perils of thesea written of in the verse for laguz, for instance. The relationship between ehwaz, the horse, and the threedifferent types of horses mentioned in the raidho/eihwaz/laguz triad should be clear; ehwaz, the fetch, isthe vehicle of the farings written forth in the runes of traveHing1 while the understanding of ehwaz inconnection with one’s earthly vehicle is needed if one is to be able to use raidho to keep it going andprotect it on the road. Whenever one finds the name of one rune or a reference to its action in the verse ofanother, one should meditate on the ties between the two and the use of the one in complementing,controlling, or mitigating the workings of the other.The most traditional conceptual divisions of runic action are written forth in the Sigrdrifumal.These are victory runes, ale runes (for dealing with the turnings of Wyrd), help runes (in birthing, orbringing-to-being), sea runes, limb runes (for healing), speech runes, and mind runes. Obviously most ofthe runes fall into more than one of these categories, although they may seem stronger in one aspect thananother. Rather than trying to break down the futhark, theredehere would seem to be to learn all thevarious workings of each rune and how to use them effectively in all the possible ways, discoveringwhich work together in which categories and manners. The rune poems and the Havamal will, again, be99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"excellent guides at first for association in this way.Runic relationships can also be found in the shapes of the staves. This is particularly clear whenone stave is put in the place of another, as in the case of the Elder elhaz replacing mannaz in the YoungerFuthark or the alternate Elder ingwaz set for the Anglo- Saxon jera. One of the better examples of the useof shape-determined relationships is thealuformula, a common runic inscription which calls on the flowof magical energy, vital force and inspiration. Laguz is the life-force flowing upward; ansuz shows thesame shape effective on and transformed through both the conscious and the subconscious; uruz showsthis power flowing through every level of being as a vital, shaping energy. The formulalaukaz, “leek,”also begins with this combination of like-shaped staves, adding the craft of kenaz and the guarding mightand upward-reaching spiritual power of elhaz to the basic idea. The fact that each word also has a fittingmeaning-alu being a drink that both strengthens and inspires, tied to the source-thought of laguz by thatrune’s use in brewing magic, and laukaz being the quick-growing, vital leek which was also used inkennings for “warrior”-adds a further dimension of might to these inscriptions.100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"9 READING THE RUNESReading the runes rightly is perhaps the most difficult of the runic skills, as it calls for a deep andthorough knowledge of all the runes and their interaction with each other, as well as considerable insightand the mental training not to be swayed by your desire for a certain answer. You must know how therunes work for woe as well as for weal and always be on your guard against the tendency to put the mostfavorable interpretation on every rune that falls Unlike the Tarot, reversal of runes has no meaning; theiraspects depend entirely on position, interaction, and the context of the question.Perhaps the best way to learn how to read the runes is to do it daily in the morning, writing downthe runes and your reading of them, and then at night writing what occurred in the course of the day andcomparing it to the runes of the morning. As so much of the practice of this lore has been lost, it can onlybe reclaimed through practice together with contemplation.MAKING THE RUNESThe most traditional method of making the runes is to carve them individually on twigs, small wands, orslips of wood. This should be done as if each were a taufr, except that rather than using a galdr-spell toshape the force into the use one wants, you should strive to fill the stave with the wholeness of its being,both for weal and for woe. You may make runes for longterm use, or, in matters of great importance,carve a set of twigs for a single casting, after which they are burnt. If you are unable to make your ownrunes, you should cleanse, charge, and color a bought set as if you had made it yourself. In empoweringthe casting runes, after the Circle Rite, you should call on the power of Odhinn and on Urdhr, Verdhandtand Skuld. For a single-use ritual, this calling should also include your question. The steps ofconcealment and bringing forth after the carving and coloring may be left out altogether, or you mayreplace them with these steps:1. Wrap the runes in a black cloth, binding them about nine times. Chant:“Within the dark watersof Urdhr’s deep well Wait all Wyrd’s runesthe world there writtenNine nights in the webthe knowing Norns weave.Walk the circle nine times deosil, your body turning widdershins.2. Trace the rune perthro around the wrapped runes with gandr or sax, singing its name. Unwrap therunes, intoning:Runes written forthto work from Wyrd’s wellFlow forth from the darknessto be read arightWritten by UrdhrVerdhandi and SkuldShow me what iswhat shapes and shall be!In a single-use ritual, the staves may be cast now; otherwise, say,Wrought is the work. So shall it be!See the runes enclosed in a shining sphere of might which holds the power in them, ready to show thestreams of their force flowing forth from the Well when they fall. Place them in their pouch or castingcup.3. Absorb the energy of the circle into yourself or return it to the universe.101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CASTING THE RUNESThe simplest method of rune-casting is the three-rune spread. Holding the pouch or casting cup, youshould face north with closed eyes, meditating on the Well of Urdhr and the streams of power flowingforth from it to shape the tree Yggdrasil (some of the images from the meditation on perthro may behelpful here). You now concentrate on the shape of your question and try to feel the streams that areflowing into it. When you feel a strong connection, you should trace the rune perthro around the pouch orcup and say,“Flowing now forth from Wyrd’s world-wellStaves shall show all Set into beingUrdhr who is Verdhandi becomethShadow-Skuld should be!”Cast the runes onto the cloth. Eyes closed, pick up three runes, whispering “Urdhr-Verdhandi-Skuld,” and lay them out in that order. The first will show that which is-the roots and layers shaping thesituation you asked about. The second will show that which is coming into being now, and the third willshow what should result from the interweaving of Urdhr and Verdhandi if nothing is done to changethings.The three-rune reading may, if you wish, be expanded into nine, which will give you a morecomplete view of the factors interacting in each phase of being.Amore complex method, which is much more likely to be accurate and easier to judge with regardsto weal-working and woe- working aspects of the runes, is to follow the ritual up to the casting, but ratherthan picking three or nine runes up, to leave them all untouched on the cloth and interpret them fromthere. Only those which have fallen face-upward should be read; those which are facedown are the runesof forces that are either too deeply hidden to affect the immediate question or are absent from thesituation. The positions in which they fall will help you to determine both meaning and degree ofimportance. You should try to see the overall pattern of the runes first, tracing out the major lines orclumps of runic power, which will represent the chief factors at work in the reading. Generally lines willshow you a progression of force, moving from the rune nearest the reader outward; clumps will indicatethat the runes in question are working together simultaneously.When the runes fall in relatively straight lines, the next thing to look for is smaller lines that crossthe greater ones at perpendicular angles.~ These lines are lines of blockage; the runes in them will workwoe, reacting badly with the runes of the greater progression. They are hazards which must be crossed orwritten around. Lesser lines that slant into the greater lines may be seen as “feeders.” They are lesserfactors that contribute to or rise from the larger progression. They will more often work weal than woe,although not invariably. Some runes do not work well together in any position, while others almost neverwork weal in any ordinary situation. A sudden decline of energy in a linear pattern (say, from fehu orsowilo to isa) or a rune of disruption (such as thurisaz or hagalaz) should in most cases be taken as awarning.In clumps you should look for interactions within aettir divisions and conceptual interaction todetermine which aspects of each rune will show through. Berkano together with ingwaz or jera, forinstance, will in most cases show a good result, while berkano next to isa would show great inactivity,silence, and perhaps even death. Runes that touch interact more strongly than runes that do not. Slightoverlapping may be a sign of unity: one rune hiding another shows either concealment or blockage andwoe-working, depending on whether the topmost stave is one that normally indicates concealment or not.Those interested in further work with divination should consult Edred Thorsson’sAt The Well ofWyrd,the only reliable book on the subject which is currently available. Unfortunately, the market isflooded with texts on what is alleged to be runic divination, written by people with little knowledge ofmagic and less of Teutonic tradition (one book even calls the runes, which are almost purely Germanic inorigin and solely Germanic in use, the Celtic Runes!). You should beware of “experts” who cannotbackup their expertise with legitimate historical research and knowledge of the Teutonic mind.102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"10 TOOLS OF TEUTONIC MAGICThe ritual implements of Teutonic magic are somewhat simpler in conception than those of traditionalceremonial magic, although the correspondences, materials, etc. can be elaborated upon to the limits ofthe vitki's ingenuity.THE SAXThe most important tool used in runic magic is the sax-knife with which the runes are carved. For askilled runic worker, this is the only tool necessary, as described in theEgil's Sagawherein the hero EgilSkallagrimson, works a number of magics at need simply by carving and coloring the runes. The sax isedged on one side only, slanting sharply down from the dull side about an inch back from the point;It is exceedingly important that this knife be kept sharp, both for symbolic purposes and for ease ofcutting and shaping wood for tines, carving the runes, and drawing blood if that is the means of coloringused.The sax can be used in every case where thegandris called for. Unlike ceremonial magic, Teutonicmagic uses the knife for invoking and sending force as well as for banishing. The only magical purposefor which the knife should almost never be used is the cuffing and digging of magical herbs, because thetouch of cold iron is considered to break their power. This may of course be wished in certain cases whereyou are breaking an enchantment (see Chapter 13, Elecampane). The point of the sax is also useful inlaying pigment into the runes, although if blood is used you must be very careful about cleaning it after toavoid corrosion, Some vitkar prefer to use a thin triangle of wood for inlaying the pigment and a specialcarver or ristir for etching runes into various surfaces, as described in Edred Thorsson's Futhark.Fitting gods to call upon in the hallowing of the sax are Odhinn (who, as Lord of the Runes, shouldbe called upon in all rites dealing with the runes in general), Tyr, and Freyr. In all hallowing of runictools, it is also well to call upon Urdhr, Verdhandi, and Skuld, the three Norns.THE GANDRThegandr,or wand, is used for calling up, sending, and charging objects with runic force. Theexact thickness and length will of course be the personal choice of the vitki, depending on yourcircumstances; if you want to carry it in a purse or a pocket, it will clearly need to be fairly small, whereasif you have a full harrow (altar) set up, it may be quite a bit bigger. Generally, the gandr should not bethinner than a finger nor too thick to wrap your hand around; a measurement often found is the lengthfrom elbow to either the tip or the base of the middle finger. It is good, if you can, to keep all of yourtools in relative proportion to each other and to yourself, thinking of them as extensions of your ownbeing.The gandr is traditionally made out of either wood or bone. Hazel and yew are perhaps the mosttraditional; ash and oak are also good, and if you feel a particularly strong pull to a certain tree, you arebest advised to go with that rather than crippling your own magic for the sake of a system. In the case ofbone, it should come from an animal that the vitki knew and considered strong and worthy or else fromone that the vitki fought him/herself on equal terms: slaying a full-grown buck with a knife or a wolf withbare hands, for example. Using a gun in this case is unfitting and cowardly If you should otherwise come103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"upon the bones of a suitable creature, it is best that the animal have died naturally. If not, it mustnothavebeen killed for sport but for a needful purpose such as food, and you must perform a fitting rite of thanksand lay the animal's spirit to rest before attempting any other hallowings.When the raw wood for the gandr has been taken from the tree (see Chapter 21, Rite of Tree-Gift),it is necessary to strip the bark off, preferably using no tools other than the sax, and sand the woodsmooth. You may at this time make an oil by carefully heating (though not boiling!) appropriate herbs inlinseed oil, straining it clear through a coffee filter, and charging it with the force of the futhark either in asingle rite or nightly from New Moon to Full. The wand should then be rubbed with this oil until itgleams. This technique can be used in the making of talismans as well.The runes carved upon the gandr can range from a simple carving of the futhark to whatever thevitki's mind can come up with. It is suggested that the numerical value of the inscription be either amultiple of 24 (the futhark) or 9. Adding the vitki's own name to a runic inscription was frequently doneand it is fitting to work it into the carving on the gandr, as that tool is a representation of the vitki's will.In hallowing the gandr, you should call upon Odhinn Galdrfadhir (father of magical songs) and theNorns.THE HORN OR CUPThis tool is used to hold water, ale, or mead as fitting to various rites. A natural horn is best, as thisby its very being refers to the aurouchs of uruz, the shaping life-force which works from the horn.If you find a natural horn which has not been prepared, you will need to sand it down and polishwith steel wool, then jeweler's rouge. To clean the inside it is best to pour boiling water down the hornand let it sit till cool, then repeat several times to sterilize and clean out debris. During this process, youshould intone the rune uruz and trace it over the horn, visualizing the waters of the rune flowing through,cleansing it and filling it with power. Finally, you should melt paraffin in a double boiler-being verycareful not to let it catch fire, as it is highly flammable-pour it into the mouth of a horn, and swirl itaround until the entire inside is coated, pouring out any excess wax before it can set.The runes can be scrimshawed onto a horn fairly easily with the sax. Depending on the material ofthe cup, professional etching may be needed. The runes laguz, uruz, and perthro should be prominent inthe inscription. A sample might be UR ALU URUZ POUR URUZ URDHR URUZ POWER URUZ,written around the rim of the vessel thus:which adds up numerically to 216 or 9 x 24, the futhark multiplied by the number of wholeness, and alsocontains 9 uruz-runes.Thorsson also recommends that the vitki have a horn or cup with the word Odhroerir (the mead ofpoetry) etched on it, in runes and drink mead out of this for Odhinnic inspiration.[1] This can be madeinto a mighty rite on its own.THE STAFFThe staff can be seen as a larger gandr, being made and hallowed in much the same manner. It isuseful in drawing power from and faring through the higher and lower worlds. It shows the vitki'sunshakeable will piercing through all the realms. At the most elaborate extreme, you might carve aneagle at the top and a dragon at the bottom in reference to the World-Tree. This tool is not however, asnecessary as sax, gandr, or horn/cup; use of it will largely depend on individual preference.FIREPOT CANDLESA firepot with coals is good to have, if possible. It signifies the quickening power ofMuspellheim.2 Recels (incense) is burned on the coals. Also, a newly hallowed item may be passed104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"over the coals or through the smoke to increase its power. The firepot should be set within the southernpoint of the circle.Candles are used largely as focuses at the beginning of a ritual, representing the vitki's mightshaped by will. If you regularly charge your ritual candles, kenaz is the appropriate rune to use. Acandle may also be fully charged in the same manner as a talisman and burnt in a ritual to free its fullmight into the working.Candles are needed for light in nighttime workings, since having an electric light on is disruptive tothe more delicate flowings of energy. The candles should, if possible, be lit directly from the firepotwith an appropriate line of galdr and then set on the harrow before the vitki. Alternatively, candles canbe set within the borders of the circle at either the four or the eight points of the compass. If you wish,candles used in this manner can be charged with the fires of elhaz and worked into the warding of thecircle.Candle colors are dependent on the intuition of the vitki and the purpose of the rite. Red candlesserve well for almost everything; white and blue are also good general colors which may be preferred incertain meditational and religious rituals. Otherwise, see the guide to Colors in Chapter 11.MORTAR AND PESTLEThese items are used for grinding pigment and recels. Magically, only iron or steel areunacceptable materials. Practically, you will do best with a small stone mortar and pestle (available atmany herb stores and/or head shops). Wood is more difficult to grind roots and bits of wood in;earthenware tends to be rather breakable.If graving runes on these items is possible, a good simple formula is eight wunjo-runes spacedevenly around the rim of the mortar and a ninth on the top end of the pestle. The runes around the rimblend the forces from the aettir of the heavens and the divisions of the runic circle, while the ninth shapesand completes the harmony, bringing the numerical value up to 72(3 x the futhark count a particularlypowerful number in traditional runic workings).It is necessary to clean the mortar and pestle thoroughly after every use, as it is both sloppy anddisruptive to have bits of the last working's energies interfering with those of the next. As you scrub thephysical residue out under running water, you should also see the cleansing power (uruz) of the waterrunning all through the mortar and pestle to remove all the magical residue.THE HAMMERThe hammer is really more religious than magical in nature; however, inscriptions exist in whichThorr is called upon \"to hallow the runes.\" Magically, it is used to drive out all wights and forces whichare detrimental to the working and to fill the place or thing in question with holy might. Should you bemagically assailed, the hammer can be used in rites of defense. The sign of the hammer should be paintedor carved on or above the doors and windows of your house to ward it and bring \"luck\"-the weal-workingof the energies within.The hammer should be all of iron or steeL or else have an oaken handle; the head should besymmetrical, like that of a mallet, rather than a carpenter's hammer. It should be as heavy as the vitki cancomfortably handle. If possible, a swastika should be graven on each end. A good inscription for the haftmight be THORR VEURR (Thorr the Hallower): (96=8 x 12 - orgarnic wholeness,power of the winds brought forth into the earth).To use the hammer in hallowing, you should swing it three times deosil over the object or personbeing hallowed, chanting a galdr such as \"Veurr hallow vitki's might\" or \"Hammer hallow these holyrunes,\" envisioning a great rush of shining might whirling into your object from the swinging hammer.105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE HARROWThe harrow, or altar, should be the center of your place of working. This place may be eitheroutdoors or indoors; if outdoors, in the center of a grove is preferred, but hardly necessary. If you can doyour workings under the open sky, it is important to be assured of your privacy and freedom fromdistraction. Trucks and airplanes roaring by hardly enhance concentration, while some people (and police)become very upset when faced with any form of magical or pagan working.The most traditional form of harrow is one made of heaped stones under the open sky. If youshould find a large natural boulder set in an appropriate place that feels right for your working, so muchthe better. In this case the circle, rather than being drawn or embroidered, should be cut into the eartharound the harrow with your ritual knife.If a stone harrow should be impractical, the next best choice is one made of oak or ash. A smallflat-topped cabinet in which the ritual tools can be stored when not in use is excellent for this purpose.This harrow can be rubbed with a charged oil in the same manner as the other wooden tools. If you sowish, the futhark ring can be carved upon it along with such other inscriptions as seem fitting, dependingon whether it is used more for worship or for magic, or equally for both.106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"11 LAWS OF TEUTONIC MAGICPOETICS OF GALDRMAGICThe essential goal of ritual is to provide a focus by which the magician can most effectively raise andguide power. This is of particular importance in runework because of the many-sided being of the runes,which requires firm and specific concentration on the side of a rune's being and the result wished if youwant to avoid unforeseen consequences. Control is of the greatest importance: a miscast or unguided spellis far, far more likely to cause woe than weal. Despite the current romantic attachment to \"wild magic\"among those who are more familiar with fantasy novels than with real life, the true mage must be able torule everything she/he does, or it is very likely to destroy him/her. Ritual can generally be divided intotwo major categories: physical action and verbal incantation. To work a spell is literally to en-chant; theword galdr comes from a root meaning \"to sing.\" Unfortunately, the writing of the poetic part of the ritualis often difficult for the ordinary person, as it calls for a good understanding of poetics as well as magic.The more powerful a runesong is as a piece of poetry-as something which both stirs the heart and shapes aclear image in the mind-the more power it will draw up from the depths of the vitki's being and the betterit will guide that power. Poetry's effectiveness depends on four elements: rhyme, rhythm, image, andsense. The last of these is simply the message encoded in the poetic work; the more deeply you feel thereason for your working, the more strongly the sense of the galdr will affect you. If you can findcorrespondencesforyour working in the larger universe, this will also increase the might of your galdr-both psychologically as you feel the greater forces with which you are working and magically as you calltheir might into the ritual. The idea of rhyme covers not only the end-rhymes which are thought of bymost Westerners as a distinguishing characteristic of \"poetry,\" but all the consonance of sounds which canbe achieved in a poetic work. These include alliteration (initial letters the same), assonance (\"rhyming\"vowels, different consonants), and consonance (same consonantal sound within words)-all of which are ofgreat value in runic work, as the vitki can weave the sound of the runes he/she is using into her/hisincantation, thereby strengthening the power of their vibration at every level of his/her being and focusingher/his subconscious along with his/her conscious. An excellent example of how this works can be seen inan exerpt from Dylan Thomas:The force that through the green fuse drives the flower Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees Is my destroyer. And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.Although this stanza has little overt rhyme, the consonantal pattern offlower-destroyer~evercreates thesame sense of impetus and unity that a standard rhyming pattern would. Therr-sound, creating a feelingof rushing motion is emphasized over and over: \"The force thatthroughthe green fusedrivestheflower,\" etc.In Teutonic magic you will do best to stick to the patterns of Teutonic verse, in which \"rhyme\"appears only as alliteration, placing the emphasis on the alliterated words. This is particularly powerful inrunic work. If you, for instance, were to chant: \"ByraidhoIridetheroad a-right,\"you would not onlygain the benefit of the repeated sound of the rune but also direct that rune fully into your intention,strengthening the sense as well.The use of rhythm in incantation serves several goals. As an element of poetry, rhythm sets agreat deal of the tone and character of the poem. You can compare the slow, funereal beat of Foe's \"TheRaven,\" for instance, with the galloping hoofbeats of \"Paul Revere's Ride.\" The rhythm of the incantation,107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"as much as the words, shapes the quality of the energies it raises. The bestgaidrar,of course, are chantedor sung rather than spoken, with each word given its full vibrational and rhythmic value. When this isdone right, the rhythm of the spell will also regulate the breath of the vitki, putting her/him into a state oftrancelike concentration. It is best if this can be done with the rite of hallowing the circle; Thorsson'sHammer Rite(Futhark),with its slow incantation of each of the runes and necessary breath control, is agood ritual for this purpose. Rhythm unifies the physical and the mental being. If the spell can beaccompanied with drumbeats and dancing, so much the better. If the setting does not permit this, the vitkishould strive as greatly as possible to create a rite which has a similar effect on the consciousness of theworker. The most important words of the galdr should of course fall on the emphasized beats of theincantational rhythm, which, in Teutonic poetry, are usually those that share the wished-for rune sound inalliteration or, if necessary, consonance.Image may be thought of as the means by which the sense of the galdr is translated into mentallyand emotionally striking terms. This is also some of the purpose of symbolism: a candle lit may show thefire of a person's life; the candle snuffed out is that person's death, the fire of life gone from his/her eyesand her/his body cooling. If this is done in the proper way and under the proper conditions, it will causethe like happening in the target who has been identified with the candle.The use of image and symbol in your galdrar should be done so as to give you a full emotional andmental awareness of the might with which you are working and the end to which you guide it. A coupleof lines of poetry should be able to create the same effect in the prepared mind as an entire guided runicmeditation. The power of poetry lies in its compactness: through sound and image it can encode a vastamount of passion and magical power in a very little space, filling the mind with the wholeness of aconcept that would have taken a thousand ordinary words to communicate.Also hidden in the use of image is the thought behind \"the power of the true name\"-that which is noless that the absolute understanding of a person or thing expressed in a single word or image and whichcan be reached only through immediate mystical experience or by the power of skaldcraft tocommunicate(and at the same time gain power over) it (ansuz). This is also one of the ideas behind theGermanic riddle-poetry known as kennings-to demonstrate the fullness of your knowledge and hence ofyour power. By calling a warrior \"oak-of-battle,\" the skald communicates the warrior's strength, her/hisendurance, his/her unyielding courage in a fight, and her/his rulership over other warriors, as the oak isusually the tree of rulership in the Indo-European tradition. With this understanding, you might strengthenthe oak's trunk with tiwaz and set the sun-wheel of sowilo to shine through his/her branches for vktory; oryou might blast the mighty oak with the lightning-stroke of thurisaz.Those kennings which refer to kinship - calling Thorr \"son of Jord (Earth),\" for instance-areeffective because, knowing a person's kin, especially forebears, you know more of the layers which haveshaped that person and hence more of that-which-she/he-is. You can see this in the sagas, which usuallystart by telling about the grandparents and parents of the hero in question. Certain elements of this powermay also have been borrowed from Finnish magic, in which, to enchant someone, you must know thatperson's full lineage-all that has gone into creating the person of the moment and that still works withinthat person's being.The image in magical poetry both encodes an idea or force in magically understandable and hence usableform and gives it the capability to impact upon all levels of the mage's awareness, concealing it andbringing it forth at the same time. For both of these reasons it is important in Teutonic magic to keep asclosely as one can to words with Anglo-Saxon roots. Firstly, monosyllables have more gut-level impactand are more immediately descriptive than polysyllables, being usually the first words associated withimages in a child's mind. This is especially noticeable and powerful when you are dealing withonomatopoeicwords-roar, crash,etc. Generally speaking, the more concrete and basic an image is, theeasier it is to visualize and the more powerful its effects will be. Secondly, every word in a tongue is aproduct of the unconscious thought-system from which it has stemmed, and hence it carries certainimplications about the workings of the universe. Thus, words grounded in the Germanic world-view willbe more powerful in runic work because these words come from the same framework of thought thatproduced the runes as we know them. An exact etymology is not as necessary for poetic work as it is forscholastics; nevertheless, you should be able to tell the difference between words of Germanic and wordsof Romantic origins, and likewise between words with Indo-European and non-Indo-European roots, the108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"former in both cases being greatly preferable. Older, even archaic, words tend to be more reliably Anglo-Saxon-faring for \"journey\" or \"travel,\" for instance. The serious student will do well to find at least a briefguide to the Anglo-Saxon language, which is not too difficult for anyone who reads both English andGerman, once you grow used to the vocabulary. Failing this, the translation of thePoeticEddaby Lee M.Hollander and the works of J.R.R. Tolkien are good guides to the use of \"Teutonic English,\" Tolkienbeing perhaps the ultimate example of a Germanic linguist recovering the vitality of Anglo-Saxon speechand Germanic legend in modern English. Of course, certain words simply have no current Anglo-Saxonbased equivalent; the choice in this case is between using current Latin-based words or reviving Anglo-Saxon/Old Norse forms for one's personal use.TEUTONIC RITUAL AND LAWS OF MAGICCertain basic laws hold true and virtually unchanged throughout all forms of magical workings.Others vary in both expression and effectiveness from culture to culture. As Teutonic magic workssomewhat differently than the more familiar Western ceremonial magic or those neo-pagan traditionswhich have been created in the twentieth century from archetypal patterns, it is important to know themajor elements of this form of ritual work well; only a fool does a magical rite which she/he does notunderstand.THE VITKI IN RITUALThe greatest part of magic is the vitki him/herself: her/his confidence in self and personal power,belief in the effectiveness of the rite itself, and complete absorption in the work during performance. Aninsecure magician cannot master any energy or other being effectively. One whose mind is split betweenbelief and skepticism or concentration and self-consciousness will be unable to use his/her full power andhence dilute the effectiveness of the rite. Complete certainty and confidence are absolutely necessary. Forthis reason, spells from all traditions often include statements of power and confidence at the beginningand the end of the working.Related to this is the creation of the magical persona for any given rite - one of the secrets behindthe many disguises of Odhinn. An example of this use may be seen in the All-father's theft of Odhroerir:As Odhinn could gain the mead of poetry only through betrayal and workings of woe, he disguisedhimself under the name of Bolverk, Evil-worker, and began his work with the murder of several field-thralls, building up the magical energy and the identity of the persona he needed to use. The use of themagical persona charges the rite with an added certainty and intensity, as can be seen in severalrunestones in which the vitki has identified her/himself by a name which is fitting to the purpose of theinscription, thus filling the enchantment with the totality of the person performing the runes and suchgodly aspect as she/he has taken upon him/herself.1Creation of a Magical Persona:1. Draw or trace your circle. Standing outside the circle facing north, concentrate on filling it withthe energy appropriate to your rite. The example here will be a rite of warding. The vitki will ofcourse subsitute colors, names, descriptions etc. as appropriate. In this case, the energy will begold with a faint rainbow shimmering.2. When the space within the circle is so thoroughly charged that you can see the rainbow-gleaming gold with your open eyes, visualize the energy drawing together into a human shape,which may be male or female depending on the purpose of the rite. In this case either is fitting,though the female may be slightly more so. She is tall and very fair, with sky blue eyes andlong hair so blond it is almost white streaming from beneath her elk-antlered helmet. Greatwhite swan's wings arch up behind her. She wears a golden byrnie and carries a golden swordwhich shimmers with rainbow fire. Her golden shield has a burning rainbow elhaz graven on it,109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"and she holds both shield and sword up in a defensive position. When you can see her clearly,you chant:\"Hail to thee, Brightshield! Hail, heaven-bright warder!\"3. Step forward into the circle, moving into Brightshield's place and take up her defensive stance,merging with her as you do so. You feel the elk-horned helmet on your head, the weight ofshield, sword, and byrnie, and the strength of the great white wings which arch out from yourback. You are created as a defender, shining with holy fire. Your sky-blue eyes see through allthe Nine Worlds; you are ready to meet and overcome any threat. You cry out, hearing yourvoice ring through all the realms of being,\"I am Brightshield, heaven-bright warder,My might shines in shield and sword.My worth shall throw back all workings of woe,Where the secret staves I write, shall ward.Not wight nor witch, not etin nor alf, Shall withstand the strength of works I wreak.I am Brightshield, heaven-bright warder!\"4. Set up and proceed with the rite as normal, including the initial drawing of the circle andcreation of the ritual space, as your crossing its bounds broke the first circle. All of this shall bedone in the persona of Brightshield.5. When the ritual has been completed, including the breaking of the circle and rewrapping oftools (except gandr or sax, whichever was used in creating Brightshield), draw a second circlearound yourself and assume the original defensive stance of Brightshield. You, the vitki, willthen walk out of Brightshield, leaving her standmg inside the circle. Close the circle behindyou and stand for a moment, being sure that your visualization of the persona inside is clear.Say,\"I am (your magical name) the vitki. Brightshield, thy work is wrought!\"6. See her slowly dissolving into her component energy, until her form has melted altogether intorainbow-sparkling golden light within the circle.7. Break the circle and return the energy to the universe. Alternatively, you may choose to storeeach persona in an item of jewelry or ritual dress so that you may assume each one by simplyputting the article on, rather like the way in which one changes shape in seidh-magic.SILENCESilence in preparing for the rite is important because it helps one to focus on the ritual and avoiddissipating energy. Mundane words and unnecessary actions distract the vitki's mind and weaken his/herpower. in magic, every action must be deliberately willed for a specific effect. In Teutonic magic it isnecessary to go to and from the place at which you perform any magical act in silence, no matter whatyou see or who tries to talk to you. This silence should be maintained in all ways when garbing andsetting up the harrow. During the rite no words other than words of magic should be spoken, and youmust be thoroughly silent when cleaning up afterwards and putting one's tools away.RITUAL GARBThe ritual garb, like the rule of silence, reinforces the fact that everything about a ritual is set apart,concentrated in power, and willed. Some prefer to work skyclad; however, it is generally thought that110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"clothing put on solely for ritual work is better, because the act of donning this garb aids in concentratingthe mind on both the conscious and the subconscious levels. The exact type of clothing used is not asoverwhelmingly important in Norse magic as in high ceremonial workings, but it is still meaningful.Traditional Norse clothing-tunic, breeches, hooded cloak-is easy to make and comfortable to wear. Thebreeches are traditionally red, the cloak dark blue. A simple robe may also be used at need. One shouldbear in mind when choosing colors, designs, etc. for ritual clothing and jewelry, that the more supportingcorrespondences one can find in the Teutonic universe and the runes themselves, the more power one willbe able to call into these things. In a sense one can say that the use of ritual garb and a magical nameworks in much the same manner as the creation of a magical persona, the difference being that rather thanentering a persona for a single rite or type of rite, one is expressing the wholeness of one's true self withpower in all things.THE CIRCLEThe use of a circle in magic appears virtually worldwide. It is every bit as traditional in Teutonic magic asin Western ceremonial workings, serving several essential purposes. First, it separates the vitki from themundane world, creating an area which is an all-encompassing microcosm ruled by the vitki's will. Itblocks out both mental and magical forces, concentrating the vitid's mind altogether on her/his purpose.As an impenetrable boundary, it is a necessary warding against the multitude of hostile/ reactive forceswhich the use of magic always draws. It also serves as a focus within which power can be raisedeffectively.The design of a circle can range from a simple ring to an exceedingly elaborate structure, accordingto the knowledge and inclination of the vitki. A good simple circle is the rune-ring divided by the aett ofthe solarhringar:111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"If circumstances keep one from drawing or painting a circle on the floor, or if one travels often, a goodalternative is the embroidering of a circle on a large piece of cloth which can be spread on the floor. Ninefeet is the traditional width; the circle can be smaller if necessary but should be at least slightly wider thanthe outstretched arms of the vitki, because you do not want to be putting parts of your body outside it. Thecircle should actually be visualized as a sphere of shining power. Although it is possible sometimes tostretch it from the inside, this will weaken the circle as a whole, which is not a good idea. Putting bothfeet outside the circle, or allowing a break in the physical structure, will break the entire circle. The bestway not to have to push against the sphere of power is to make a list of all necessary earthly tools, and tomake sure thatallthese things areinsidethe space of the circle before you draw it. It isabsolutelynecessaryto retrace a permanent circle before each working, going over its lines with fingertip, gandr, orsax and visualizing its brightness Springing up in light of an appropriate color.One should lie within the circle when faring between the worlds, as it is both a place of power andwill ward off hostile forces. Closely related to the charging of the circle is the practice of circle-walking, which raises power in aspiral of concentration. To draw down heavenly mights or to enact the passage of the sun (\"nights\" in the112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Teutonic tradition, the \"day\" being the half-passage of the solarhringar), walk or dance deosil; to draw upearthly mights, walk widdershins (the direction of the Earth's turning). Widdershins was given itsunfortunate reputation because of its association with the magic of Nerthus, Freyja, and Het and becauseof the frequent use of chthonic power in curses. It is not intrinsically negative, woe-working, or any sortof perversion of the order of nature.The walking of the circle should generally be done lightly, almost as a dance, although differentrituals will of course need different rhythms. It may be found effective to spin one’s body in the directionopposite to that of the spiral. At first this will cause giddiness, but once controlled, it will add to thepower one is drawing into the circle.RECELSRecels, or incense, is used in Teutonic tradition for cleansing a place or thing: \"smoking out\" thosewights and powers which are not wished within.3 It can also be used in the process of charging theworking space with the desired energy and levels of vibration. While it is not absolutely necessary for thevitki to make his/her own recels, the scarcity of appropriate scents on the general market will almost forcethis upon one; and of course, properly made recels will be much more powerful than any store-boughtincense, (Chapter 13 may provide a useful basis for composing your recels.) Folk names for herbs,especially those based on Anglo-Saxon or other Germanic beliefs, will be a good guide to their powers,Cunningham's Magkal Herbalism, and Grieves' Modern Herbal are excellent sources for further research.In making one's recels, one should trace the runes of the workmg over the materials, intoning theirnames and feeling the might of each one flowing through the gandr into the recels. One should continueto chant the names of the runes and perhaps a line of galdr describing the purpose of each in the workingas you grind, channeling the flow of the runic power through one's body and the pestle into the recels. Itmay be further charged with a drop of blood when the grinding has been done. It is best to make onlyenough for one ritual; if excess is left over it can be disposed of in the running water of the sink or elsekept in a clean, dry, glass jar with a clear label so that it may be used again in the next rite of this sort oneperforms. Runes may also be cut, colored, and scraped into recels for the purpose of directing them into aplace where visible motions and audible chanting seem inappropriate, or where the force of the fullyactivated rune is needed and there is no time to cut and color it-though in this case some galdr will benecessary to direct the runic power to its end.GOD-CALLING; HAMINGJAIt is general practice in almost all fields of magic to perform a brief god-calling after the drawing ofthe circle and before beginning the active part of the ritual. This furthers the process of banishingunwanted/raising wanted energies. By calling the gods to witness her/his acts, the vitki consciouslyguides his/her power through all the worlds. This idea is furthered by the practice of calling upon one godat each quarter of the compass, four being a number of earthly completeness and manifestation. It is alsopossible to call upon one deity for each of the aett- divisions of the solarhringar. This further strengthensthe working in that, by speaking the name of the god, one calls into oneself a little of the hamingja-force(mana) of the god, adding that energy to the rite. It is recommended, however, that if one is making areally serious attempt to pull in the hamingja of a being much larger than oneself, that one have a staff orsimilar large focus that one can channel the energy into so as to avoid having one's brains stir-fried.The hamingja is the storehouse of magical/life energy which everything possesses to some degree.4It is closely tied to the faculty of shape-changing, being that undifferentiated force which is the strengthof thehamr,or hide-that fine body which goes forth, often in the shape of another being, in the faringbetween worlds. The hamingja, however, can be passed temporarily between one person and another; itwas not unusual for a Norse king to \"lend his luck\" to a messenger or champion. The personal hamingjacan be increased by workings of magic and courage. When drained by the expenditure of magicalenergies, it will refill to its normal level within a period dependent on the strength and activity of thevitki. It is not unusual for magicians to set up deposits of this force outside of their bodies which can bedrawn upon when they require more power than their normal capacity. These deposits can be built up ineither objects or places, as wished; they should, however, be well warded against both magical andphysical discovery and/or tampering.113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"As well as seeking to augment his/her own store of hamingja force by magical practice and othermeans, the vitki will also want to be aware of that contained in the items with which she/he works. Agreat number of the Anglo- Saxon charms give directions for recognizing stronghamingjurin specificcases, generally by some unusual feature showing power: a nettle which has forced its way through astone wall (called for in a charm against rheumatism) clearly has more strength than an ordinary nettle;wood from a tree which has grown twisted together with two others will make a more powerful rune-tinethan wood from an ordinary tree; a stone with a natural hole in it has a great deal of power within, and soon. Most such specifics having been lost with the interruption of the oral tradition, however, theidentification of strong hamingjur will in practice be largely dependent on the vitki and his/her ability todraw on the wisdom of her/his racial or personal predecessors.SIMILARITY AND CONTAGIONSimilarity and contagion are the two most general laws of magic. Briefly, the Law of Similarityholds that things which seem alike, are alike; the Law of Contagion rules that things once in contact willremain in contact; and in both cases, whatever happens to one will happen to the other. Similarity is usedheavily in skaldcraft and symbolic actions: two things are compared, thus forging the magical linkbetween them, then the vitki works her/his will on the one he/she can directly control. Contagion isgenerally used either in aiming a spell or in drawing power from something large of which one has apiece. If, for instance, one wanted to start 6 thunderstorm, one might carve the appropriate formula withrunes for lightning (thurisaz), wind (ansuz), and rain (uruz) on a piece of oak wood-hopefully from a lightning-struck oak-then mingle a bit of thunderstorm water with the pigment forcoloring and rub the consecrated tine with the water, using the completed tine to sprinkle the water on theground, and finish the rite by hurling the tine upward with a thunderous shout of \"THORR!\" The use ofthunderstorm water is Contagion, the lightning-struck oak mingles Contagion with sympathetic hamingjaforce; the sprinkling of the water and throwing the tine up with a shout like thunder is Similarity, and theuse of Thorr's name is hamingja-calling.BLOOD, BREATH AND SPITTLEThe Laws of Similarity and Contagion can be further seen in the magical use of blood, breath, andspittle. As the breath is the sign of life and the source of power for the spoken work, as well as beingidentified with the spirit, it should be clear to the vitki that her/his own breath is a powerful vehicle forfilling anything with life and magical force. Hence it is needful to sing the galdrar as close to the carvedtine and as intensely as possible so that the force of the breath and vibration of the words should fill it.This is also effective when using liquid as a vehicle of power. A vast number of Germanic charms aresung over a liquid which is then drunk by the subject.Blood is, of course, the life-force of all animals; hence, by coloring the runes with your blood orwith magically charged red pigment, which is equivalent to blood by the Law of Similarity and the powerwhich the vitki has put into it the vitki is filling the runes themselves with life. Alcohol may also be usedin this manner, especially if the runes are to be scraped into a drink. A traditional alchemist would saythat the effectiveness of this is due to the fact that alcohol is the life-force of plants and hence works inroughly the same vitalizing manner as blood or its magical equivalent.Spittle carries the personal hamingja-force in the same manner as breath or blood, but to a lesserdegree. Spittle is often used in the swearing of an oath, under the Law of Contagion: as it has a bit ofoneself and one's power in it, spitting to seal an oath is magically holding oneself hostage to one's word.The mingling of two people's spittle is like the mingling of blood, but the binding created is much lessintense, being suitable for legal contracts and so forth. As a vehicle of power, spittle is often used tothrow up a quick barrier of protection: one spits three times to block off woe-working energies.CONCEALMENT; BINDINGThere are two types of concealment in ritual practice. The first, temporary concealment, in whichan item is wrapped in a black cloth or buried in the ground for a period of time, is used in the creation of amagical item. This is intended as a period of gestation (berkano) in which the powers that have beenworked into the item may come into full being. This is particularly useful when coming into physical114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"being is desired. The second, permanent concealment, is done (as a part of ritual outside of practicalconsiderations) for the purpose of making the working more effective in the hidden realms of power. Anitem may be physically hidden in the earth, beneath the floorboards of a house and so on, or runes may beconcealed by numerical encoding or by other means such as \"ice-runes,\" in which row and placement areindicated by tallies of isa-runes, the larger showing the row and the smaller showing the placement in therow. Other runes have been used in this manner, but isa, being simplest is most common. An example ofthis can be seem in the encoded name of Odhinn: /////////////////////////////// (0=3:8; D=3:7; 1=2:3; N=2:2; N=2:2) The aettir can also be reversed so that 0=1:8 and so on. There are several forms of runic encoding whichwork on this principle.The power of secrecy is in some ways similar to the power of silence; it concentrates the energyand attention into the working and separates it from any distraction so that it can pierce more effectivelythrough the hidden realms of being. For this reason it is also a good idea to keep one's magical toolswrapped in black cloth or kept in a special box when not in use. Silk is preferred by many traditionalistWestern magicians because of its value as a psychic insulator; linen is preferred by traditionalist vitkarbecause of its association with Hel/Holda, the Concealing Mother.Binding and unbinding play a fairly important part in ritual because of the direct control of energythey represent. The act of tying a knot or tracing a circle about something is one of the most immediatelypowerful ways to achieve mastery and hold force in, while the untying of a ritual knot generates a suddenrush of energy which should be directed at the moment of untying. The traditional example of this is thewell-known figure of the weather- worker loosing and binding the winds by tying and untying the mouthor a bag or a knotted string-a \"wind\" being any rush of power.FIRE AND WATER; BREWINGFire and water or other liquids often appear in ritual workings, usually as complementary forces.Both are, of course, tools of cleansing and are frequently used as such, although in runic practice thecorrespondence would be to kenaz or nauthiz for fire and to uruz for water, rather than to the elementalfehu and laguz. In using a flame or sprinkling water for ritual cleansing, you would want to make thatdistinction in your mental structure and verbal formulae. The elemental forces are used for direct transferof life and hamingjaforce, fehu being the quickening of life and hamingja-power and laguz the basic life-energy. The use of air in this setting, of course, would be as the magical breath carrying the life-power ofspirit.Running water plays an important part in Teutonic magic. Whenever the use of water is called forin a ritual, it is best to go out before sunrise and gather running water from either one or three streams, orelse to gather the dew off the grass, since both run- fling water and dew have the particular active qualitywhich is so mighty in the Well of Wyrd-they are said to bring life and renew the strength of youth.Running water can be used to either cleanse something enchanted or to simply carry woe-workingenergies away from you.The use of water or other liquids, especially alcohol, as a vehicle for runic forces is an ancienttradition; both the highest myths and the simplest charms hold drinks of power into which runes havebeen scraped and over which galdrar have been sung. Liquid is, in fact, an ideal condenser of energies,being by nature highly receptive and manipulable.If you have access to a shop which sells materials for home- brewing, you will find it vastlypreferable to brew your own ritual mead and ale, performing a rite which climaxes with the adding of theyeast to the mixture. Runes may be daily traced and vibrated into the froth of the yeast on top, andappropriate herbs may be added to the drink as well, either by steeping them in it or by making a fairlystrong tea with the water which is used for brewing. This may in fact make the brewing of mead easier, asit is sometimes difficult to get honey and water alone to ferment. You should be very careful that the115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"herbs you use for this purpose are nonpoisonous, and also remember that a little herbal taste can go a verylong way: half or a quarter of an ounce of dried herbs is enough to flavor a five-gallon batch of strongmead quite thoroughly. It was common practice among the Norse people to brew their enchantments intoale or mead; you may make small batches for specific purposes, or hallow a general-purpose batch whichmay be directed towards more specific ends later. Care should be taken if the enchantment itself isdirectly tied to the ever-growing action of the yeast. It is quite possible to end up with something muchstronger than you expect and hence potentially disastrous (rather like intending to smoke marijuana andending up on a surprise acid trip).If you are unable to actually brew an enchanted drink, scraping the runes into mead or ale andsinging the galdrar into it, being sure that your breath stirs the surface of the liquid, is equally astraditional. A more potent enchantment may be set into mead by repeating the rite for three or nine nights.Herbs may be steeped in it as well, though the same cautions apply as do to brewing with herbs. A singlefresh leaf or small dried pinch is quite enough for one bottle.Another alternative to brewing, especially if you wish to use herbal lore in conjunction with runicpower, is the creation of herbal tinctures or fluid condensers. These are less traditional than the other twomeans, being dependent on distilled liquor as a base, but are still within the spirit of Teutonic traditionand can be quite powerful. Herbal tinctures can be made by filling a clean glass jar two- thirds with freshor dried herbs, then filling it to the brim with Everclear or unflavored vodka (methyl alcohol must not beused). This should be done on the night of the New Moon, after which one should trace the runes and singthe galdrar appropriate into the tincture every night of its maturation. If runes are to be scraped into it, thisshould be done on the night of the Full Moon after the tincture is strained, or else a drop of the vitki'sblood should be added on that night in the final ritual of enchantment. A few drops of this tincture may betaken internally (if none of the herbs used were poisonous); otherwise it may be used to charge an itemwhich, for whatever reason, cannot have runes carved into it. The herbs strained out may be dried slowlyin your oven and used as recels.NUMBERNumber is used in Teutonic magic for the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of runic writings andspells. It differs from standard Western numerology in that the Germanic counting worked on a base-12system (whereby we still have “eleven, twelve\" instead of \"oneteen, twoteen\"). Hence the consciousnessof \"perfect numbers\" is shifted to twelve, its factors, and their multiples.Number in runic inscriptions can be shown by the total of the numbers of the runes in theinscription or by the number of runic staves (bind-runes counting as a single stave). These numbers canbe used to multiply the potency of a runic incantation or to guide the sphere through which it works,according to either general Teutonic numerology or the specific numerology of the runes.ONE:One is the prime source and the end of the synthesizing process; in all Indo-European cultures, asingle thing or deity will quite often be divided into three aspects: Odhinn = Odhinn/Vili/Ve, Odhinn/Hoenir/Lodurr; the Well of Wyrd = Hvergelmir, Mimir, Urdhr, etc. An understanding of this continualprocess of division and synthesis is important to the working of Teutonic magic, especially as numericallore is concerned.TWO:In Teutonic magic, the power of duality is not so much conflict of opposites (which, to beeffectively powerful, must be resolved into the synthesis of the triad) as it is the common working ofcomplements (ehwaz). This can be seen in the archaic dual kingship, the Vanic twins Njord/Nerthus andFreyr/Freyja, and the pairs Geri/Freki (Odhinn's wolves) and Huginn/Muninn (Odhinn's ravens), as wellas the other manifestations of dual power discussed under ehwaz. It is associated with active balance.THREE:Three is the first of the great magical numbers of the Teutonic people. As two is the number ofactive balance, three is the number of action/reaction. It represents the synthesis of opposites to createdirected force (see thurisaz), as fire and ice create the first life. A chant or word of power is often repeatedthree times to set it into action, and a rune is carved three times to multiply and activate its power. It isboth permissible and effective to alter the galdr slightly with three repetitions, being sure to stick to the116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"alliteration in each case. A formula for active defense, for instance, might read \"Thurisaz break the woe-worker's words / Thurisaz break the woe- worker's works / Thurisaz break the woe-worker's will!\" thusmultiplying the power and effect of the rune.FOUR:Four is the number of stability and the completeness of earth. It bears reference both to the fourdwarves who forged Freyja's necklace/girdle Brisingamen, the ring of earth-power which is one of theoldest emblems of the Earth Goddess among the Northern Europeans, and to the dwarves Nordhri, Austri,Sudhri, and Vestri (the four points of the compass). It is a number of wholeness and manifestation. It isalso associated with the sun in its aspect as the stable source of warmth and light. It is frequently used inrituals which deal with the fertilizing effect of the sun on the earth, especially rituals of worship; it mayalso be used for localizing and containing a problem.FIVE: The Germanic week was five days long; the number five appears in the Anglo-Saxon charms as anactive complement to the number four. Five is a number of active order and control.SIX:The number six does not appear often in Teutonic mythology or religion, though the six-sided figureis a powerful emblem. As the unity of the balanced activity of two and the synthesis-activity of three, it isa number of great potential magical power.SEVEN:The number seven is more characteristic of Oriental and Mediterranean occult studies than ofTeutonic magic; it does not appear in the myths or in native charms. Thorsson identifies it as \"the numberof death and passive contact with other worlds.\"4EIGHT:As four is the completeness of earth, eight is the completeness of the heavens and theotherworlds. It is the divisions of the solarhringar, the eight winds, the eight legs of Sleipnin etc; it is thenumber of travel between the worlds. Like two and four, it is a number of harmonious wholeness.NINE: Nine is the greatest of Teutonic magical numbers: There are Nine Worlds, Odhinn hangs ninenights on Yggdrasil, magical songs are taught in either groups or multiples of nine. Holy fires are oftenmade with wood from nine different trees, and nine nights is\" a standard period of time between a magicalworking and its final effect. Nine and its multiples are often used to bring things into being and empowerthem in all realms. It bears the same sort of active relationship to eight that three does to two and five tofour: it is power, direction, and rulership over the organic forces of the even number.TEN and ELEVEN: These numbers are used seldom, if ever, in Teutonic magicTWELVE:Twelve is a great Teutonic number of wholeness and being. There are twelve gods and twelvegoddesses (24, the most complete number of the Teutonic system), and twelve great halls in Asgard; theuse of the quasi-duodecimal system of counting has already been mentioned. Twelve is the number ofpower brought into earthly being and earthly being strengthened by power. Multiples of twelve are allmighty, the most powerful being the 24 of the futhark and its multiple by three, 72.THIRTEEN: This is a mighty number of wisdom and magical power. It is considered \"unlucky\" by thecommon people because its mysteries are not for the unwise, weak, or untaught. The mysteries ofnumbers beyond these may be understood by their factors, both as those are seen in general Teutonic loreand in the futhark. Even numbers always carry a power of balance; odd numbers, especially primenumbers, a sense of active will.COLORThe most powerful colors known to the Indo-Europeans were red, blue, and white, with red being thegreatest of those. Red is the color associated with life, with blood, and with power in general; it is thecolor most often used in magic. The nature of blue varies with its shade: in its lightest hues it is thedaytime sky, the color of hope and revealed wisdom; in its darkest shades it is the sky at night and the117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"dark sea, the color of hidden wisdom and mystery-the color of Odhinn's cloak. The sea or air between theworlds often appears as dark blue. White is the color of intensity of spirit aspiration, and activity;Heimdallr is \"whitest of gods,\" and to be fair or shining is a sign of power. The English word \"white\"comes from the Anglo-Saxon hvit, meaning \"silver-white\"; silver and white are functionally identical.Purple can be seen as a shade of either blue or red; it appears several times in the Anglo-Saxonsources.Gold, like red, is a color of power and life. Like white, it is a color of spiritual aspiration andintensity of energy, although more earthy in nature.Green and brown are colors of the earth. Dark green is associated with the Vanic mysteries, lightgreen with birth and the Vanic power springing forth. Green is also associated with the fertility andhidden mysteries of water. Brown is associated with the Dokkalfar.Yellow is a color of ambition and fertilization. It may be seen, in one aspect, as the masculinecomplement to green. It can also be seen as the color of the sun's workings upon the earth, or a veryearthy gold.Black is the ultimate color of concealment and mystery, into which dark blue anddarkgreen bothshade. It is the color of stlllness and death, and the womb of rebirth.TIMEThe Teutonic use of time in magic is not nearly as strictly regulated as that of ceremonial magic. It ismainly ruled by the position of Moon and Sun, although certain times of the year are more powerful thanothers.The times of day which are traditionally used in Teutonic magic are sunset, midnight, and sunrise;it is unusual for a ritual to be performed between sunrise and sunset. Sunrise is best for religious rites,some meditational rituals, and collecting of herbs and hallowed water. Sunset is also good for religiousrites and some meditations; trials should begin at sunset. Midnight is best for practical magic, for someinitiations, and for divination. These times are by no means the only times at which you may performrituals of any sort; as always, it will depend on both the individual vitki1s intuition and her/hiscircumstances.The day of the week is relatively unimportant in Teutonic magic. If it is convenient, the day whichbears the name of a god fitting to one's rite may be used for extra harmony of atmosphere, but omittingthis detail will not detract from the rite's efficiency in any way. The days of the week correspond thus:Sunday=Sunna, Monday=Mani, Tuesday=Tyr, Wednesday=Odhinn, Thursday=Thorr, Friday=Freyja(also Freyr or Frigg). Attempts have been made to force Saturday to correspond to Loki, but these havebeen largely unsuccessful. A closer similarity lying between Saturn and Nerthus might be suggested, asboth are chthonic deities with power over agriculture and keepers of the dead, but there is no historicalreason to maintain this correspondence in the days of the week.The strongest influence in scheduling your rituals will probably be the phase of the Moon. TheNew Moon is good for beginnings and the increase of growth; the Full Moon is the night when magicalpower is at its strongest flow in the open; the waning Moon is good for bindings and putting magics intoconcealment; and the dark of the moon is the night of the greatest hidden magical power. Most magic istraditionally done at either the new or full Moon.The most important times of the year are the solstices, the equinoxes, and the full moonsimmediately following these peaks of power. In tradition, at least, the mightiest time of magic is thetwelve nights of the Yule feast, beginning at the night of the Winter Solstice. At this time, the Wild Huntrides and the other worlds are closest to the earth.118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"12: OTHER MAGICAL SYMBOLSAlong with the runes, the Teutonic people used a rich array of other symbols which were mightyemblems of both religion and magic. Most of these are older than the runes, having been used during theBronze Age (in Scandinavia, roughly 160OA50 B.C.E.), but their use continued through the runic period.THE SUNWHEELThe sun-wheel is one of the oldest symbols ofNorthern Europe. It represents the power of the sunas an ordering force, the sun in its daily wagon-round through the sky (raidho). Also appears assolar cross.AEGISHJALMAR (Helm of Terror)This symbol appears carved beside the figures ofwarriors; a more complex form is still used inIcelandic magic.

Wearing the valknut is a sign toOdhinn that one is ready to be taken into the ranks of hischosen warriors at any time he chooses. In this symbolyou may see the interwoven workings of Urdhr-Verdhandi-Skuld, or of Odhinn in his many tripartiteforms. Meditation upon this image is well worthwhile.HAMMERhe hammer of Thorr is the greatest of Teutonic symbolsof warding.

They are often worked into charms or hung with redthread over the windows and doors of a house to ward it. Herbs were also used in brewing and in aid ofother forms of magic, both galdr and seidhr.A great deal of the deeper herblore of the Germanic peoples has been stamped out by Christianity,but echoes of it have remained in the folk names and traditions concerning some plants, and the keen eyewhich knows what to look for may find the traces that lead back to the workings of our ancestors.Many of these attributions were aided by, though not wholly dependent on, the attributions listedby Edred Thorsson in Futhark.ACONITE: Called Tyr's Helm or Wolfsbane, this plant is so poisonous that it should not be touched evenbarehanded. It is associated with the harsher justice-dealing sides of tiwaz. Another name, Auld Wife'sHood, suggests a possible tie with the Norns and perthro.AGRIMONY: Traditionally laid under the head to cause a deathlike sleep, which was supposed to lastuntil the plant was removed. Still used to aid sleep and quiet distracting thoughts. Agrimony works wellwith isa.ANGELICA: Angelica is traditionally an herb of warding and cleansing. It is thought to guard against andeven cure the plague. The plant was once prominent in Lettish paganism. Its harvesting in the earlysummertime was marked by a ritual song which has, unfortunately, be- come either so antiquated orcorrupt as to become unintelligible, but which is still learned in childhood and sung today.[1] Christianityassociated this plant with the Archangel Michael. It was fairly common for Christianity to substitute thetermangelfor \"valkyija,' \"fylgja,\" or \"dis.\" The mention of Michael may show that this plant wasoriginally tied to Heimdallr, the fairest of the Aesir. All of the Angelica's parts are considered effectiveagainst woe-working magic of any sort.Angelica is used in touching the highest realms of Yggdrasil being associated with elhaz and thecleansing fire of Bifrost.APPLE: Apple trees which are good bearers are wassailed at Yule, and their fruits are eaten at that time ofblessing. It is the Apples of Idunn which give the gods their endless youth and strength. The Apple is atree of fruitfulness, healing, and joy. It works well with jera.ASH: The Ash is a very holy tree. Yggdrasil is said by some to be an Ash; Askr and Embla, the firsthumans, were made from an Ash and an Elm by Odhinn, Hoenir, and Lodurr. Ash wood is good for thegandr and for the vitki's harrow. It is associated with ansuz and hagalaz.BEECH: The Beech tree was connected with the casting of lots in early Germanic times. Its name in someGermanic dialects means \"book,\" hinting that its wood was used for runic writings. It is associated withperthro.BISTORT: Also called Twice-Writhen, Adder-Wort, Snakeweed, and Dragon-Wort. The root is knownfor its twice-turned shape which writhes back upon itself. It is fitting to use with nauthiz.BLACKBERRY: The Blackberry is frequently used in the cure of various forms of swelling, the suffererbeing passed through a natural loop in the hedge. It is particularly useful in turning back runes of woe.The Blackberry is good to use with kenaz.CHAMOMILE: Called Baldur's Brow (a name shared with several small white flowers in the North), thisplant makes a calming tea and brings joy and peace on all levels. Chamomile works well with wunjo.124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"COWSLIP: The Cowslip is also called Key Flower. It is thought to open the door into Freyja's hall ormound. It is closely tied to kenaz.ELDER: Also called Hylde-Moer, this tree is closely tied to the female Vanic powers. The name Eldercomes from the Anglo-Saxonaeld,\"fire,\" being a reference to the use of the hollow branches in blowingup fires. The Elder tree is still held in great respect in England and the Northern countries. Her wood isnot burned for ordinary purposes and is only cut after one has asked permission with the formula, \"LadyEllhorn, give me some of thy wood and I will give thee some of mine when it grows in the forest.\" It isthought that if a cradle is made of Elder wood, Hylde-Moer will come and strangle the child laid in it.The Elder tree is associated with second sight. In Denmark it is thought that standing under her onMidsummer's Eve will enable one to see \"the king of Fairyland\" and all his men come riding by. It is alsowritten that the pith of the branches can be cut into rounds, soaked in oil, lighted, and floated on a pan ofwater to show one all the witches and sorcerers around one. [2] The Vanic might can be seen in all ofthese workings; Hylde-Moer is a form of Holda or Hel; as Freyja, she rules the doings of \"witches\" andthe visionary power of seidh-magic. The Elder tree is associated with fehu and, to a lesser degree, withberkano.ELECAMFANE: Called Elf-dock or Elf-wort by the Anglo-Saxons, Elecampane was used largely towork against the ills done by elves-to stab the plant's root with an iron knife was to break the elvishmagic. Elecampane may be used to gain the favor of the Alfar as well. A gift for them may be left by theroots of a wild patch. If the root is being used in recels, a drink, or a taufr, it should be dug before sunrisewithout the use of iron and covered, and the digger should speak no word from the time she/he leaves thehouse to the time he/she returns with the root. It should be kept hidden, preferably under the harrow.GARLIC: This plant's name means \"spear-leek.\" It is also called Gruserich (\"king of the grasses\"). [3]Sigurdhr's wife Gudhrun likens him to \"the garlic grown the grass above,\" [4] a reference to this plant'squick-springing might. Garlic is a great strengthener, both magically and physically. It is associated withboth laukaz and tiwaz.HAZEL: The Hazel tree was used for hedging in courts of law in earlier Germanic times. \"Wishing rods\"were made of peeled Hazel boughs, and Egill Skallagrimsson used a Hazel stave in making hisnidhing-poleagainst Eirik Bloodaxe and Queen Gunnhild. It is said that oak and Hazel cannot be planted or usedtogether. The Hazel is fitting to use with raidho.HOUSELEEK: Also called Thorr's Beard. This herb is traditionally planted on the roofs of houses toward off the danger of lightning or fire, and was thought to be a protection against sorcery as well.

Its name,laukaz,is an alternate namefor the rune laguz and a powerful formula for runic talismans.LOOSESTRIFE, YELLOW: In folklore, yellow loosestrife is thought to quiet savage beasts and ease thestruggling of oxen at the plow and restless horses. It is good to use with ehwaz.MANDRAKE: The European Mandrake(Atropa mandragora),which should not be confused with theAmerican Mandrake or May-Apple(Podophyllurn peltatum),is called by the name Alruna and thought tobe one of the most powerful of herbs. Alruna is also the name of a wise-woman, and the Mandrake isoften spoken of in the feminine. It is associated with eihwaz. Certain customs connected with the transferof the family's root from father to son or brother to brother [5] also may tie it to the kinfylgja.

It is used as a stuffing for pillows which open the vision of dreams. Mugwort can be made intoamulets to aid travellers. It guards one from woe-working beings on both bodily and spiritual journeys.The Nine Herbs Charm mentions it as a protection against poison, serpents, and “the loathsome foeroving through the land\" (probably an ill-wishing seidh-farer).

The working of seidhr-magic originated with the Vanir and wasbrought to the Aesir by Freyja, who taught it to Odhinn.Historically, seidhr seems to have been thought of as less respectable than galdr-magic, andcertainly as unmanly. In the Lokasenna, Loki taunts Odhinn with having woven spells and flown aboutlike a witch, \"were these womanish ways, I ween\".[1] Aseidhkona(female) was feared, but respected; aseidhmadhr(male) was looked upon with contempt as well as fear. This attitude probably stemmed fromthe fact that the Germanic women were always thought of as closer to the worlds beyond Midgardhr andthe workings of the Norns, and that the magical workings involving faring forth into the other realms andfore-seeing that-which-should-become were largely kept from men. Consequently, over the course oftime seidhr became classed simply as \"women's magic.\" It is also true that visionary ability is more easilyawakened in women than in men, and that seidhr, like many shamanic forms, may have involved thetemporary feminization of the male practitioners.The term seidhr is used here to cover a number of related arts:faring forth from one's body, usually in the \"hide\" of an animal or with the aid of the fetch; sending thefetch out itself; performing works to directly affect the mind or soul of another while out of the body;sitting out in a circle at night to hold conversation with various spirits and beings; and the trance of thespakonaorspamadhr(ill- translated as \"prophetess,\" \"prophet\"), the faring to the Well of Urdhr for thesake of seeing the patterns of what is becoming and what should be ~- fore-sight much surer but harder toachieve than the reading of the runes, being shown as visions rather than a casting, which depends on thevitki's ability to read and understand and which thus may be easily mis-read. The word “seidhr\" is relatedto the root for \"seethe,\" and it is thought that part of this practise involved the boiling of objects formagical purposes while singing magical songs (perhaps part of the origin of the \"witches' brew\" offolklore?) There has not, however, been much study done in recreating this aspect of seidh-magic, and itwas not well thought of even in heathen times.FARING FORTHThe first of these crafts, faring forth in the shape of an animal, is the most commonly written ofamong the seidh-skills. The Heimskringla mentions that \"Odhinn could shift his appearance. When he didso his body would lie there as if he were asleep or dead; but he himself, in an instant, in the shape of abird or animal, a fish or serpent, went to distant countries on his or other men's errands.\" [2] It is alsodescribed how another wizard went forth in the shape of a whale to scout out Iceland for an invasion, bothjudging the earthly lay of the land and testing the strength of the guardian spirits of the land (see Chapter18, Landvaettir). This tale shows that one of the advantages of seidhr is that when one is faring forth, oneis able to see all manner of things which are hidden from the eyes of the body. This practice has survivedlong past the coming of Christianity in most Germanic areas. Tales of witches going forth in the hides ofother creatures were not unusual as late as the sixteenth century, when the well-known witch IsobelGowdie confessed to having gone into the skin of a hare or a cat.Faring forth in an animal hide should not be confused with theberserkergang,although both havebeen classed as forms of lycanthropy. When one fares forth, one keeps one's human mind and only theshape changes. In the berserker fit, one is altogether overcome by the beast within, and dressing in theanimals skin is merely an aid by which its spirit can take one over. The two workings are similar in manyways, but one is a magical means to a number of possible ends while the other is an end in itself andbelongs properly to battle-magic and the mysteries of Odhinn. Also, the berserkergang, being limited toone type of animal, would seem to call upon the might of the fylgja, while one wight can take many formsthrough simple shape-changing. This is further discussed under Outdwellers.128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"FARING FORTH: THE WORKINGEarthly Tools:Gandr, sax (held in the hands); if the circle is large enough, the staff should be used inplace of the gandr.Recels (by choice):Will vary according to the faring's goal, but should always contain a great deal ofmugwort.Garb:Seidh-robes, vitki's garb, or skyclad. There is reference to Freyja using a cloak of falcon feathersto fly through the worlds, and using a mask or similar symbolic garment to take the spiritual shape of ananimal is a frequent shamanic practice. Should it be wished, if one has a hide of the creature one is goingto become - an item of clothing with a claw, tooth, feather, etc., or a mask - one can enspell that item withthe power of holding the animal's shape, so that simply by putting it on one's spirit can be shaped andfreed. The runes fehu (for the hamingja-force), ansuz (for the loosing of the soul and travelling on thewind-roads), and raidho (for the faring-forth and to ward one on the way) are good for this working;others may also suggest themselves to the aspiring seidhkona or -madhr. Runic aids should be workedbefore the first faring; the filling of the garment with the shape-power should be done at its end, in thesame way that one charges an item with a magical persona. The garment is, however, not necessary to thisparticular craft.It is wise and prudent to do all one's trance-workings from the inside of a warded circle. The emptylich is vulnerable to anything that might wander by, and if the soul should find a swift withdrawalnecessary, it is much, much better to have a circle to come back into. Of course, one's working roomshould already be well warded, but the extra guarding is still good when one is leaving part of oneselfopen.Time: At choice; however, this work may be easier at first if done at night.Circle-Walking: Deosil, if faring to the elemental worlds or above Midgardhr; widdershins, if faring toSvartalfheim or Hel or if one will be calling upon the hidden powers in one's workings outside the lich.Rite:1. Circle Rite (see Rites)2. (if recels is used) Light the coals, chanting,Fire from Muspeliheim free recels' mightForth fare the flame-clouds ready my roadWafting, shall ward me in my wide wanderings.Walk the circle thrice, bearing the recels.3. Facing northward, raise head and hands and chant:Heidh, I hail thee hide-wise in faringWoman of seidhr's secret soul ways.Fearless, I fare forth hide and hugr flyingTo see and shape things hidden to see and shape my will!4. Lie down on your back, sax in right hand and gandr or staff in left, making very sure all bodyparts, hair, etc. are within the circle and out of danger from the recels burner. Close eyes andbreathe deeply, setting up a regular rhythm. Feel your hide within your lich, the two shaped thesame, the hamingja-force pulsing through both with breath and blood-but different-the one finer,freer, bound only to the other with a silver cord connecting the navel. Now picture in your mindthe shape of the animal you want to take. Breathe it into yourself { feeling your arms becomewings or hands narrowing to paws, feathers or fur sprouting or skin hardening to scales, face129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"jutting forward into a beak or muzzle. When you have fully changed, you should be aware of theseparation between your animal hide and your human lich. Open the eyes of your hide andbreathe in with it, lifting or turning away from your body. Stand or hover, raising your head, andlook about your room, clearly seeing both the earthly room in full detail and whatever magic hasbeen worked upon it or lingers within. When this sight has become clear, you may fly or run forthfrom your room. It is best at first to fare to close and well- known spots on the surface ofMidgardhr. When you have become skilled in this, you may try to go higher to Alfheim or belowMidgardhr's skin to Svartalfheim.For faring forth to the elemental worlds, you should see yourself in beast-shape standing at thebeginning of a road or root which arches through the mist in the direction of the world you seek.Do NOT STEP OFF THIS ROAD. Should you be threatened by another wight on it, you shouldeither make the sign of the Hammer or trace and send an elhaz-rune at it, which will ward awayunhallowed wights. You should also be able to shield with your staff. Asking questions of thesebeings is good and can be a source of much wisdom, but you should be wary of giving your ownname; rather, like Odhinn, you should have a number of use-names for the road. Remember that itis unwise to trust strange wights, no matter how fair they may seem. The roads between theworlds are dangerous, and it is not uncommon for a wound received in this faring to appear in theearthly body, or for mages to die of a seeming heart attack while travelling. When in doubt, returnto your body at once.5. To return in your body, see yourself merging into your empty lich. Feel every detail of yourshape changing back into that of a human. Now aware of the human-shaped spirit within thebody, let the two breathe deeply together three times, melding until they no longer feel separate.Even if you seem to have had little or no success in faring forth, this step MUST BE DONEEVERY TIME, or else the hamingja may be lost, which can cause illness or worse. Separatinghugr(thought) andminni(memory) from the lich can be hard for some people; the only cure forthat is frequent practice. You may, at first, find yourself going forth in your sleep without havingplanned to. In this case draw a circle about your bed or attach a copper wire to your sax and stringit around the legs of your bed to form a closed circle of warding, and always be sure to do a fulland mindful returning to your body.With more experience in faring forth, one will probably find, as in runic workings, that one has lessneed for the trappings of ritual. The purpose of the rife is both to concentrate one's faculties to use one'sfull power effectively and to train one so that the essence of the working becomes ever more accessible atneed.Faring forth with the aid of one's fylgja may be done in the same manner as written above, exceptthat rather than changing one'shamr,one remains in human shape and rides on the back of the fylgja,which should be easy to see with the eyes of one's soul. When one has established an aware relationshipwith the fylgja, one may send it forth to gather information or fill it with added hamingjapower and haveit act for one.SPAE-CRAFTThe craft of fore-seeing has not been worked with much in modem times, but it has beenthoroughly written of. The practice of this form of visionary magic was looked on with more favor thanwere the forms typically described as seidhr, as it was almost always used for weal and its practitionerswere wise and holy people. Spakonur often went about from place to place prophesying, and athorough description of one is given in the Saga of Eirlk the Red. The woman wore a blue cloak withfastenings of straps, and it was set with stones around the border down to the hem. She wore glass beadsaround her neck and a black lambskin hood lined with white catskin. She carried a brass-mounted staffthe head of which was inlaid with stones. She was girded with a young bearskin belt and to this hung alarge pouch in which she kept her instruments of magic. On her feet she wore shaggy calfskin shoes with130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"long, heavy thongs, on the ends of which were large brass buttons. She had catskin gloves upon herhands, the white fur of which was turned inward. The food given this woman to honor her was preparedfrom the hearts of every kind of animal that there was in the neighborhood. To enter her trance, she satupon the witch's seat(seidh-hjallr).The women formed a circle about her and a young girl sang the ritualsong called Vardhlokur (Watch-guard) which had been taught to her by her foster-mother.3 Another sagatells of an Icelandic Vala who travelled accompanied by fifteen boys and fifteen girls, who wouldpresumably form the circle and sing the song.The greatest tools of spae-craft seem to have been the staff and hooded cloak. The staff was asymbol of the spae-worker's authority and may have been used in typical shamanic fashion for thejourney between worlds. The hood was placed over the head during the working. It would seem to havecut off the spae-worker from the seen world and made her/him able to receive wisdom from the hiddenrealms. This was done for both fore-seeing and to deal with problems that could not be solved by ordinarymeans, as when the Icelandic lawspeaker Thorgeirr, faced with the problem of reconciling pagans andChristians under one law, contemplated the issue in silence \"under the cloak\" for a day and a night beforehe called the folk to the law-rock.4131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"SECTION III: GODS AND WIGHTS15: TEUTONIC RELIGIONThe religion of the Teutonic peoples held within itself every possible level of spiritual consciousness andearthly practicality. All weal-working wights were honored at the proper times, from the spirits of rock,stream, and tree on up to All-Father Odhinn. This honor however, even when paid to the highest of thegods, never took the form of the mindless submission that some sects of Christianity have been so quickto promote. The Teutonic belief is that humans are sib to the gods; we are literally \"Heimdallr's children.\"[1] Thus we honor them as the parents and elders of our house who have brought us forth, who teach us,and who give us the wisdom and strength to follow the paths of might that they themselves walk. We aresisters and brothers to the wights of the land, with whom we meet and work on equal terms. Teutonicworship is for those who are proud and strong-not sheep led by a shepherd but humans who can act ontheir own, though able to listen to redes of wisdom and glad of the gifts that make us more like to thegods. Only a fool would scorn their help at need, but to gain that help you must be strong and worthy ofit, depending first of all on yourself.The main act of worship was theblot,or blessing. The greatest blessings, and those most widelypracticed among the Germanic peoples, were the four seasonal blessings of Yule, Ostara, Midsummer's,and Winternights. With the exception of Midsummer's, which was celebrated on the Summer Solstice, thedates for these blessings would vary within roughly a month after the marking point of the solar year. TheWinternights blessing was called Winter-fyllith (Winter Full-Moon) among the Anglo-Saxons. This mayshow that one way of choosing the exact time for the blot was by the Full Moon following the equinoxes.The Yule feast began on the Winter Solstice and continued until January 1 or January 6.Winternights will usually be held in the month following the Fall Equinox. This blessing is alsocalled Alfablot, Disablot and Freyblot. At it the ancestral wights and the Vanic powers are honored. Itwas generally, though not always, the custom for a woman to carry out this rite. The most characteristicrunes for this festival are berkano, ingwaz, and jera.All the gods and goddesses can be honored at Yule, thought it is particularly associated withOdhinn (one of whose many names was Jol), Freyr, and perhaps Ullr. The sacrifice was a white boarwhich was led around the benches. The folk would put their hands on this animal and swear oaths for thecoming year before it was slain. The oath-ring was also passed at the Yule festival. It was, and is,traditional to decorate the hall or home with holly, ivy, pine, and mistletoe at this time of year. The\"Christmas tree\" is also a pagan custom:gifts of food and drink were left for the alfar and land-wights beneath trees in the wood, and whenhanging real animals and men on trees as sacrifices had been discouraged, the folk turned to bread imagesand then to decoration in general. The burning of the Yule log is also traditional, and the last of one logshould be saved to light the next year's fire. Appropriate runes are jera, eihwaz, and sowilo.Ostara is associated with the goddess Ostara, of whom little is known otherwise. It usually falls inthe month following the Spring Equinox, possibly on the Full Moon of that month. Processions weremade through the fields at this time to bless them. The giving of colored eggs was also a part of this ritualand still is, Bonfires were lit at this time, and it is said that maidens in white (perhaps Ljosalfar) werevisible in the hills and wild places on Easter morning. Good runes are dagaz and berkano.Tyr, and perhaps Forseti, would have been especially honored at Midsummer's, as it was near tothis time that the Thing took place. The lighting of the need-fire is traditional; it should, if possible, bebuilt of nine kinds of wood and have nine kinds of holy herbs burnt in it. Fitting runes are raidho, tiwaz,and sowilo.The central act of the blessing was the sacrifice of one or more animals. The blood was spilled upon thealtar and sprinkled over the folk; the flesh was seethed in a cauldron and eaten at the feast. Evidenceshows, however, that sacrifice was performed less for its ownsake than as a hallowing of the slaughter,132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"which was a practical necessity. The month of slaughtering was called Blotmonath(month ofblessing) inheathen England, and it is likely that each animal was hallowed before it was slain. For this reason, unlessone owns a farm at which animals are slaughtered regularly, it is not needful or even desired to revive thecustom of animal sacrifice (it is also illegal, and leads to bad press). Pouring an offering of mead or aleover the harrow or onto the earth is all that is needed. Alternatively, one can make animals out of bread(charging them strongly with life-energy) and ritually slaughter and eat them, sprinkling mead or ale fromthe blessing bowl. The gift of loaves shaped like animals was used in Germany for several centuries afterthe Christianization of that land, and even today in Sweden the Yule boar survives as a pig- shaped cake.It is further customary to drink several minnehorns (horns of memory) at these feasts, according tothe gods being honored. The best-documented toasts are those of Yule, where the first horn was drunk toOdhinn for victory, the second to Njord for fair winds and good sailing, and the third to Freyr for peaceand prosperity. It is also written that some drank to Odhinn for victory in battle, but those who trustedmore to their own strength called upon Thorr. If you feel particularly drawn to one of the gods orgoddesses more than the others, you should of course drink that toast. Likewise, it is fitting to drink theminne of heroes, dead ancestors, and absent friends.Blessings can be offered at any tie of great need. You should, however, remember that the givingof a gift creates an obligation and that if you do this too often it begins to become annoying-to the gods aswell as to humans.The practice of Teutonic religion is not necessary to the practice of Teutonic magic, but it is helpfulboth in that it strengthens your relationship with the gods-all of whom can aid in different aspects ofmagic-and in that it brings you to a greater awareness of the godly forces expressed in the runes, as wellas of the Teutonic mindset as it grows to encompass the twentieth century. Performance of the blessingsis also good for strengthening your sensitivity to the seasonal flows of power, just as the rite \"Hail toSunna\" raises your ability to feel and use the greatest points of power in the course of the day.Guidelines and examples of the seasonal blessings may be found in Edred Thorsson's Book of Troth.In magical work with the gods, it is best to spend some time reading about them and performingmeditations before you start performing rituals that involve them. Kevin Crossley-Holland'sTheNorseMythsis a good beginning source; theEddasare, of course, invaluable. Meditations on the godsthemselves can be performed from the descriptions here as searches. For guided meditations, onepossibility is to use the meditation for the appropriate rune and instead of following it all the way through,stopping the reading at the point where you meet the god or goddess and allowing that being to speakdirectly to you, bringing yourself back to your own body and the earth after a space of time (no more thantwo to five minutes for a beginner). For this you will do best to tape yourself reading it. StephenMcNallen's tape \"Pathways to the Gods\" (available through World-Tree Publications, P.O. Box 961,Payton, AZ 85547) is an excellent source of truly beautiful guided meditations.133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"16: AESIRThe Aesir are largely gods of spiritual awareness, intellect, and war. The masculine Aesir are generallycharacterized by air and/or fire; the feminine (Asynjur), by earth and/or water, often overlapping with theVanic goddesses.ODHINNThe greatest god of the runes is, of course, Odhinn. Saying this, you must keep in mind that the word\"rune\" speaks not only of the runic alphabet, but also means \"secret.\" Odhinn is the lord of hiddenwisdom and of the roots of power.The name Odhinn means \"fury\" or \"inspiration.\" It is derived from the Indo-European Wodanaz,\"Master of fury/inspiration\"[1] and related to the modern Germanwuetendand archaic Englishwood,bothof which carry a meaning of \"furious,\" \"mad,\" and \"wild.\" His name has been suggested to be roughlycognate to that of Vata, Lord of the Winds, in the Rig Veda.Odhinn's first form was probably that of a wind-god known by his furious rushing through the sky.He is the leader of the dead, as seen in that most enduring survival of Teutonic lore, the Wild Hunt. TheWild Hunt is thoroughly documented in every country where Germanic people have settled. It has evenbeen suggested that the song \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" is a contemporary version of the same.[2] Thisfirst naming of Odhinn as the lord of fury and death is one of the keys to his being: considering that furyis also inspiration and death the pathway to the greatest knowledge, one can see the pattern formingbehind the seemingly capricious and sinister being of the greatest of the gods.Odhinn's late usurpation of Tyr's position as All-Father brings into focus an interesting anomaly ofTeutonic belief: in no other Indo-European religious system is the god of writing (and/or conductor of thedead) set in the highest place. The Roman invaders of Germany identified Odhinn with Mercury-both arepsychopomps; both are associated with intelligence, swift movement changeability, and deception; andboth encompass aspects of the archetypal Trickster - characteristics that are not normally associated withrulership in the Indo-European mind. While it has been suggested that Odhinn is analogous to Varuna asthe king-magician of Dumezil's tripartite Indo-European system, Tyr being the king- judge, the problemwith this is that the cult of Odhinn All-Father is a fairly late development, found and spreading at a timewhen the tripartite system might naturally be expected to be breaking down as a consequence ofmigration and changing circumstance, rather than shifting back into the exact pattern of the Rig Veda.Indeed, the tripartite system is not supportable within Germanic social or religious history.Part of Odhinn's change in status is undoubtedly due to his association with war: from leader of thedead he became chooser of the dead and Valfather (father of the slain), hence finally the chooser ofvictory in battle. However, the primary source of Odhinn's cultic might is the source of his own power:Odhinn's rise to the All-Father's seat corresponds closely with the rise of runic magic among humans,both in time and in space. This is borne out by the great importance given to runic wisdom among theTeutonic peoples and the respect in which those who knew it well were held, as contrasted to the lesscomplimentary view of the Vanic seidh-magic-the magic of a cult which, though never displaced by theAesir and more beloved by the folk than the cult of Odhinn, was nevertheless overshadowed by All-Father, especially among the skalds, of whom Odhinn was the patron.As the lord of runes and incantation, Odhinn also became the lord of poetry. The story of his theftof Odhroerir, the mead of poetry, offers great insight into his nature. Here Odhinn is seen as shape-changer, trickster, betrayer, rescuer of the hallowed mead, and giver of poetry's power to other wights. Hemingles the holy inspiration which is the height of Teutonic spirituality with oath-breaking, the act mostdespicable to the Teutonic mind, because both are part of his purpose; he becomes serpent and eagle atneed.Thus, by the mystery and paradox of Odhinn's nature, he holds all things within himself. He buildsthe walls to ward Midgardhr and Asgardhr, but wanders outside at will. He is a lord of oaths and ofbetrayal, of making and unmaking. As a god of war he makes his heroes invincible till he himself comesto take them in battle. It is said, and rightly, that Odhinn enjoys stirring up strife: only through struggle134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"can one be tested and grow, and only by the clash of opposites can synthesis be achieved. Every step ofthe Odian path is a battle of some sort, whether external or internal. He is not a comfortable patron andwas seldom loved by the folk as a whole. The worship of Odhinn was usually left to princes (who hadoften been personally chosen by the god), berserkers, rune-masters, and skalds-that is, to the initiated tothose whom Odhinn himself had already touched from birth or before. He was most worshipped by theSaxons, the Danes, and the Norwegian aristocracy. It is worth noting that the Norwegian settlers inIceland, being mostly peasants who wanted nothing to do with aristocracy or ceaseless warring, built notemples of statues to Odhinn, although his touch was still prominent in families such as that of EgillSkallagrimson.Odhinn follows an endless quest for wisdom. He is master of both galdr and seidh-rnagic, the latterof which he learned from Freyja. A great deal of his knowledge comes from the dead and the realms ofdeath. He is often spoken of as calling forth the dead to learn from them; in the Harbardzljodh, he says thesource of his knowledge is \"the howes-of-the-home,\"3 that is, barrows.On the Continent, Odhinn was also honored as a god of fertility and the harvest. The last sheaf inthe field was left standing for his horse, and certain harvest-rites were performed to him.4 Truly a god ofall things!A large part of the mystery of Odhinn is hidden in his many hypostases (aspects of a god which arewell-defined enough to act on their own). The most obvious of these are Odhinn's \"brothers\":Vili (Will) and Ve (Holiness) with whom he slays Ymir and shapes the worlds; and Hoenir and Lodurr,with whom he creates the human race from trees. In Odhinn/Hoenir/Lodurr we see the three activeelements of air, water, and fire which also form Bifrost: Odhinn suppliesoctid,the breath of life; Hoenirgives the odlir-quality, which is usually shown as a drink; and Lodurr supplies the spark of life andhamingja force, which is expressed as color and hair growth. Lodurr, fire, is further divided into Loki andHeimdallr, ungoverned fire and hallowed fire (they will be discussed individually). Hoenir appears later,twinned with Mimir in circumstances which would identify them as anthropomorphic counterparts ofHuginn and Muninn, thought and memory. He is spoken of for the last time after Ragnarok, when he will\"handle the blood-twigs\"5 as Odhinn returned and made whole.The animals associated with Odhinn are the wolf, the raven, the horse, the eagle, and the wyrm-beasts of battle, death, and spiritual wisdom.Names by which Odhinn may be called upon in incantations for various purposes include Grimnir(hooded one), Gangleri (Way- weary), Vegtamr (Way-tame), Hejan (War-god); Hjalmberi (Helm-bearer), Thekk (Welcome), Har (One-Eyed; High One - homonyms)1 Sath (Truthful), Svipal(Changeable), Sanngetal (Truth- finder), Bolverk (Bale-Worker), Fjolnir (Concealer), Hroptr (Hidden orMaligned), Sigfadhir (Victory-father), Valfadhir (father of the Slain or Chosen), Alfadhir (All-Father),Galdrfadhir (Father of Magical Songs), Jalk (Gelding), Gondlir (Wand-bearer), Svithur/Svitlrrir (theWise), Harbardhr (Graybeard), Vafuth (Wayfarer), Offlir (the Entangler) and Svafnir (Luller to Sleep orDreams)-both names of serpents at the roots of Yggdrasil, Mimir' 5 Friend, Gagnrath (Giving GoodCounsel), Drauga Drottin (Lord of Ghosts), Hangatyr (God of the Hanged), Karl af berge (the Man of theMountain), Hnikar (Thruster), Frigg's Husband, and others.Odhinn is generally seen as a tall gray-bearded man in a dark blue cloak, one eye being covered bya broad hat or with the cloak's hood. He is master of all disguise, however, and appears in many formsboth animal and human, even disguising himself as a woman at need. He rides the gray eight-legged horseSleipnir; his weapon is the spear Gungnir. He is followed by the ravens Huginn and Muninn, who fly outevery day to gather wisdom and tell him what has happened in the Nine Worlds, and by the wolves Frekiand Geri.LOKILoki was never worshipped; blessings were not made to him and his minne was not drunk. As the mostdestructive and counter- social side of Odhinn's being, he was viewed with little favor. In the myths hewas sometimes helpful and sometimes unhelpful. It is p05sible that the influence of Christianity may havediabolized him somewhat, creating the wholly baleful being of the later parts of the Norse cycle. At hisbest, Loki shows the more fallible and humorous sides of the Trickster; at his worst, he is betrayal andraw chaos. In secret lore, he brings forth those sides of Odhinn's being which were seen as unfitting for135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the All-Father: his sexual ambiguity and the externalization of \"Loki's children,\" the Fenris-Wolf andMidgardhr's Wyrm, both acknowledged as antitheses to the weal-working powers of the gods, and bothbeing beasts associated with the cult of Odhinn and necessary for the transformation of Ragnarok. Loki isa fire-spirit. He is never counted among the gods by anyone, but he is the blood-brother of Odhinn-a partof Odhinn, as all the beings identified as his \"brothers\" are, who carries out his will in ways that mayeither be clear to see or hidden behind the veil of poetic drama.HEIMDALLRHeimdallr's origin is shrouded in much vagueness, due to the loss of the poem which is supposed to havetold of his history and legends, the Heimdalisgaldr. It is written that he is the son of nine mothers, who arealso nine sisters; these have been identified with nine waves and/or giantesses. He is called brightest andhighest- minded of the gods, and the white god. Although seemingly one of the Aesir, he shares the Vanicwisdom of foresight. He has been slain at least once, with a man's head. It is suggested that the \"ninemothers\" motif may show that he was killed and reborn nine times. He is the guardian of Bifrost, keeperof the Gjallarhorn which he will blow at the beginning of Ragnarok. Heimdallr can hear everything thathappens throughout the Nine Worlds. His hearing, like Odhinn's eye, is kept in the Well of Mimir. Onemight easily suspect that both references indicate the identical awareness of \"that-which-is\" as well as\"that-which-is-becoming.\"Branston suggests a similarity between Heimdallr and Agni of the Rig Veda: both are sons of the waters,both are described as white with teeth of gold, both are sons of multiple mothers, guardians, and fathers ofthe social classes of humanity. The association with Agni, who is clearly identified as sacred fire, and hisrole as guardian of the fiery bridge Bifrost, as well as his ceaseless struggle with Loki (the spirit ofuncontrolled fire) would seem to show Heimdallr as the embodiment of the sacred flame.6 He is alsocalled Vindler (Turner or Borer), which might associate him with the need-fire. Alternatively, the Odhinn/Heimdallr/Loki triad may be seen as a precise reflection of the Odhinn (air)/Hoenir (water)/Lodurr (fire)triad, with Heimdallr distinctly watery and virtually Vanic in nature.The animal associated with Heimdallr is the ram; he also turned himself into a seal to fight withLoki once.As a side of Odhinn's being, he embodies the omnipresent and uplifting Odian consciousness-thatwhich strives ever after the highest.TYRAs mentioned in the description of the rune tiwaz, Tyr (also called Tiwaz, Zio), cognate to Zeus, was theoriginal Germanic sky father god, although only a few stories about him have survived, most notably thatof the binding of the Fenris Wolf. Tyr is the chief god of the Thing. He gives justice, honor, courage, andwisdom in battle. He is associated with the sword as well as the spear. The sword-dance was part of hisworship among the Swabians, and several scholars have identified him with the sword-god Saxnot.Though largely left out or displaced in myth, he remained one of the great figures in the religious life ofthe folk, particularly on the Continent.ULLRThis god, whose name means \"glory,\" was not known on the Continent; he appears to be a nativeScandinavian sky-god, possibly Finnish, whose place was taken by Odhinn. He is particularly singled out,even by Odhinn, as among the highest of the gods. It has been suggested that he is the \"all-powerful god\"by whom, along with Freyr and Njord, vows on one oath-ring were sworn; he is associated with the oathring in other places as well. His worship was fairly widespread in Scandinavia, although he is seldommentioned in the myths.It is written in one source, the severely Chrisfianized and euhemeristic Saxo, that Ulir tookOdhinn's place and bore his name for a time; and there are also references to the alternating worship pfUllr in the winter and Freyr in the summer, which would show that the worship of this god was confinedto the winter months, at which time it equaled or superseded that of the others. The name \"Ulir\" may beetymologically connected with Yule; it has also been suggested to be a reference to the lights of theaurora borealis in the winter sky136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"UlIr is the son of Sif and an unknown father, supposed by Ingvisson and others to have been arime-thurse. He is the stepson of Thorr. He is also associated with Skadhi, of whom he is considered to bethe male counterpart. He is said to be fair of face and a great warrior. Ullr is the god of snowshoes, of theshield, and of archery. He is called upon in duels and has knowledge of the runes. The tree holy to Ullr isthe yew. The attribution of UlIr to the Aesir is solely a matter of conjecture, as there is equal reason tonumber him among the Vanir.THORRThe god Thorr was, along with Freyr, the most generally worshipped of the Teutonic gods. In the greattemple at Uppsala, his statue was set in the highest place between and above those of Odhinn and Freyr.Thorr was generally seen as a faithful warder and provider, a god who would keep faith with hisworshipers, as contrasted with Odhinn.In myth, Thorr is usually shown as the common man writ large:a tireless eater, drinker, and fighter (though none too bright). The Eddic lay Harbardzljodh gives aninteresting picture of the differences between Thorr and Odhinn. The two gods meet. Odhinn beingdisguised as a ferryman, and they engage in a contest of boasting. Thorr's list of triumphs deals with hisslaying of giants and berserkers; Odhinn's with seduction, betrayaL and stirring up war. Odhinn theninsults Thorr, who can only reply with the threat of force, and refuses to ferry him over the river, forcinghim to walk around the long way. It is interesting to note that Thorr, who fights against the giants, is verylike them in strength, size, great appetite, and seemingly uncomplicated character. This is why he is soeffective as a warder, being able to beat them at their own game, as it were. Thorr is the foe of theMidgardhr's Wyrm; this side of hisbeing is spoken of further in chapter 20.Thorr is the warder of Midgardhr; he is also the warder and hallower of all things holy. Thehammer is swung over something to hallow it. It is put in the lap of the new bride both as a fertilitysymbol and as a consecration; it is also used to hallow the funeral pyre. The uses of the hammer symbolhave already been described. A flash of lightning at the beginning of any undertaking was thought of as avery good omen. In this side of his being, Thorr is sometimes called upon in runic inscriptions to hallowthe runes or that upon which they are carved. He is also called Veun-Hallower or Holy Warder-andVingthorr, \"Thorr the Hallower.\"Like Odhinn, Thorr seems to have usurped certain aspects of the Sky-Father's position. He is oftencompared to Jupiter, as the benevolent sky-god who can also hurl thunder and lightning and who is thegreatest of gods. Thorr's aid was called upon in bringing ships safely out of storms. He is also the god ofthe pillars which support the roof of a house or temple. His image was sometimes carved into these, andsome of the early settlers in Iceland called upon his aid in finding their steads by throwing their house-pillars overboard and building where the god sent them.As the god ruling thunder, lightning, and rain, Thorr is something of a fertility god. The hammer is,of course, a phallic symbol, and the success of a harvest is as dependent on the sky as it is on the earth.He was thus invoked for prosperity and for a good harvest.Thorr can always be seen to embody the powers of order, protection, and holiness. He, rather thanOdhinn, was the defender of Norse heathenism against Christianity; the battle of the faiths was thestruggle between Red Thorr and the White Christ. The most beloved of the Teutonic heroes were thosesuch as Beowulf who, like Thorr, fought only against the woe-working chaos embodied by the out-dwellers. If one should be unable to restrain a need to call upon Loki, or if that wight's presence shouldseem to be making itself known in one's life, one should at once call upon Thor~ \"whose strength keepsLoki in line\" (Ingvar Solve Ingvisson, conversation).Thorr is always shown as large, burly, and red-bearded; flame flashes from his eyes. He walks or rides ina chariot drawn by the two he-goats Tanngnjost (Tooth-gnasher) and Tanngrisnir (Tooth- gritter). It isinteresting that in parts of Germany, Santa Claus also rides in a chariot drawn by the two goats Donnerand Blitzen (Thunder and Lightning). Thorr can slay and eat his goats, and when he hallows their hidesand bones with his hammer Mjollnir they come to life again. This hammer, which always returns to hishand after it has been thrown, is the lightning he wields. His name, Thorr, Thunar (AS) or Donar(German), means \"Thunderer.\" He wears a girdle of strength, and iron gloves, as Mjollnir's handle is alittle short. He is the son of Jordr (earth) and father of a daughter named Thrudhr (might), and two sons137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"named Magni (the Strong) and Modhi (the Courageous).The holy animal of Thorr is the goat.BALDRBaldr, whose name means 1tprince't or \"lord,\" is the god of joy and light. The tale of his death is well-documented in a number of sources, and traces of his worship appear in several Scandinavian place-names, although there are no reliable mentions of a cult of Baldr. His wife is named Nanna; he is thefather of Forseti, god of righteousness. He is desired by Skadhi and welcomed gladly by Hel.FORSETIForseti is the god of justice, who is said to reconcile legal strife between men. He was mainly worshippedby the Frisians. The greatest seat of his cult was the temple on the island Helgoland, near a sacred springwhich the god brought forth when he gave the Frisians their code of laws. He hears oaths and keeps thepeace between men, his justice being fair and reasonable to all.BRAGIBragi was the god of poets and the skald of Valhalla, welcoming the honored dead into the hall. He is thehusband of Idunn, and runes are said to be carved on his tongue. According to myth, Odhinn got Bragi onGunnlodh when he stole the mead of poetry. The minne-cup is also called bragar-full when drunk to deadheroes or to seal an oath. Folk etymology connects it with Bragi, but it is actually derived frombragr,meaning the \"foremost\" or \"the best.\"7 Bragi is called upon for poetic skill and eloquence; the harp istraditionally associated with him. He is shown as old and long-bearded, in spite of the fact that his wifekeeps the apples of youth.VIDARR and VALIThese two gods are sons of Odhinn, both begotten for the purpose of revenge. Vali was fathered on themaiden or goddess Rind by trickery for the purpose of avenging Baldr's death on the blind Hodr. Vidarr isthe son of the giantess Grid, and he rips the jaws of the Fenris-Wolf apart after the Wolf has swallowedOdhinn. He is called 61the silent god\" and is associated with the depths of the forest. These two godstogether \"will ward the gods' fanes\"8 after Ragnarok.FRIGGFrigg, whose name means \"beloved\" or \"wife,\" is the best known of the Asynjur. A great many of theother goddesses listed are clearly hypostases of her, or else names by which she was known locally. Sheis the wife of Odhinn, and shares his high seat with him. Though she keeps her wisdom silent she knowswhat is and what shall be. In this side of her being, she is called Saga, \"she who sees and knows allthings.\"9 Like Freyja, she has a coat of hawk's feathers; she is a mistress of the highest aspects of seidh-magic. Odhinn comes to her for redes, though he does not always follow them. At times she deceivesOdhinn into protecting her favorites or, when their chosen mortals are in contention, betraying his own.Above all, Frigg is the goddess of marriage and childbirth. Among her handmaidens (hypostases?)are Lofn, who brings together those who have had difficulty in getting married; Vjofn, who inclinespeople to love and keeps peace between husband and wife; Hlin (Protector), who guards Frigg's favorites;Gna, who rides the horse Hofvarpnir (Hoof-tosser) through air and sea to tend to Frigg's works; Var1 whohears all vows made between men and women and punishes those who break them; Eir, goddess ofhealing; Snotra, goddess of prudence; and Syn, goddess of denial, who shuts out those who should notenter and aids in lawsuits. Fulla, a maiden with loose hair and a headband of gold who is said to be Frigg'smessenger, her sister, and a giver of her gifts, is also probably a hypostasis of Frigg. It is fitting to callupon her by the aspect which is most appropriate to one's working. Frigg is associated with, though notidentical to, the various goddesses of spinning such as Holda and Bertha on the Continent.Frigg is a goddess of earth, though she also has a watery side, as seen by her dwelling in Fensalir(Ocean Halls). As Saga, her dwelling is spoken of thus: \"Cold waves crash around the fourth I which iscalled Sokkvabekk. I Odin and Saga drink there gladly I all their days from golden vessels.\"10 Even138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"though she is a goddess of the Aesir, her character is closely related to that of the Vanir, who are alsogods of earth, water, and hidden wisdom.Frigg's symbols are the spindle and the distaff; she is mistress of all crafts of the home.IDUNNIdunn is the keeper of the apples of youth, which renewed the strength and life of the gods. She and herapples are stolen by Thjazi, the father of Skadhi, but Loki manages to steal them back and contrive thedeath of the etin. One may compare this to the many tales in which giants attempt to claim Freyja as abride. Both goddesses embody the vital force on which the Aesir are dependent.139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"17: THE VANIRThe Vanir are gods of earth and water whose power is called upon for peace and prosperity. They are saidto be wise and to have the power of foresight. The practice of seidhr-magic is associated with the Vanir.The war between the Aesir and the Vanir is thought to be a mythological representation of an actual cult-war which ended in the fusion of the two. Vanic worship was greatest in Sweden, and the Swedish kingswere thought to be descended from Yngvi or Freyr. As gods of fertility, they were also gods of death,with whom the practice of mound-burial was associated, cremation being more characteristic of the Aesiccult. They overlap in many ways with the disir and the three races of alfar.NJORD/NERTHUSThe name \"Njord\" is a form of the name \"Nerthus,\" although the one is male and the other female; bothderive from the Proto-Germanic* Nerthuz, which might refer to either gender. The root wordnerfromwhich our \"north\" is also derived means \"under,\"1 bringing out the hidden character of the Vanic powers.The procession of the goddess Nerthus, described by Tacitus, has been discussed under the runes berkanoand ingwaz, the key elements being the procession of the goddess in the wagon accompanied by thehuman priest, the sacred island, and the completion of the ceremony with the human sacrifice, the victimsbeing sunk in the lake. Tacitus calls Nerthus \"Mother Earth\";2 Njord, on the other hand, is clearly a godof wave and wind. The description of the holy island of Nerthus and the drowning of the victims mayindicate an original union of earth and water in this figure, which was later divided. It is mentioned in theEddasthat Njord got Freyr and Freyja on a nameless sister; one may suppose that at one time or indifferent places Njord and Nerthus may have been, like Freyr and Freyja, seen as twins. The bog- cult ofthe early Germanic people is probably related to this cult also. Large staves minimally carved to makethem either clearly female or male have been found in bogs, as have the bodies of men who weresacrificed either by being strangled or having their throats cut. In the Yngling saga, Snorri Sturlusonmentions a golden necklace which was the bridal gift of the daughter of Audhi the Wealthy (possiblyidentical with the chthonic Audh, son of Night) and which a later Ynglinga queen, Skjalf, used to strangleher husband with. It is p05sible that this story is based on the Nerthus sacrifice, being one of a long line ofmysterious deaths of the kings of the Ynglings, which have been associated with the royal sacrifice.3Certainly the necklace is one of the oldest symbols of this earth-goddess.Nerthus can be seen as embodying the earth, Njord as the fertile force of the ocean and its weal-working aspects. Like all the Vanir, he is a god of wealth, which in this case are the treasures hiddenbeneath the water's surface and the wealth of food therein. He is called upon for fair weather, favorablewinds, good fishing, and the riches cast up by the sea. Njord is also associated with the passage betweenlife and death, and with the rune laguz in its fertile and mysterious aspects. His emblems are the ship,which in some places was drawn over the land in place of a wagon or plough, and the bare foot a symbolof fertility. Oaths are often sworn \"by Freyr and Njord\".FREYRThis god's name is actually a title, meaning \"Lord\"; it is likely that he is identical to the early Yngvi ormg, consort of the goddess Nerthus. Several kings who are thought to be euhemeristic representations ofthis god are named Frodhi (Fruitful), and Turville Petre suggests that his full name and title could begiven as Yngvi-Freyr-inn-Frodhi, \"Lord Yngvi the Fruitful.\"4 Along with Odhinn and Thorr, Freyr wasone of the most widely worshipped of the gods.Like Nerthus, Freyr makes processions in a chariot accompanied by a human votary of the oppositegender. Like Njord, he is associated with the ship, being the owner of a magical ship calledSkidhbladhnir, which can sail over both sea and land, the realms of the Vanir. Such concept of the holykingship as the Norse had was wholly associated with the cult of Freyr, the proto-king whose rule wasone of peace and plenty and who confinued to make the land fruitful even after his death and burial in amound, at which he received sacrifice. This may be tied to the veneration of the Dokkalfar or mound-elves (discussed later). Freyr was also said to be bra of AIfheim and hence ruler over the Ljosalfar; likethem, he is associated with the fructifying air and light of the sun. According to Saxo, there were a140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"number of kings named Frodhi, which may show that this was a title indicating the embodiment of thegod in each mortal king.5Freyr is called upon for fruitfulness and prosperity, but he is also associated with strength in war.The kenning \"sport of Freyr\" means battle. He carried a magical sword which he gave away to win thelove of the maiden Gerdhr (symbolic gelding; see ingwaz, pp.147-50). He is called \"protector of the gods\"and \"ruler of the hosts of the gods.\" One of his holy animals, the boar, was frequently used on helmets tostrengthen and guard the wearer.Freyr is also called \"God of the World.\" He is addressed magically when the earthly working ofgodly power is wished, especially in matters concerning peace, happiness, and riches, or courage andprotection in battle. He is particularly honored at Yule and/or at Winternights. The worship of Freyr isprone to running in families, and it is not uncommon for those of Swedish descent to feel a specialfondness for this god.It is written that Freyr has a messenger named Skirnir (the Bright), who is often thought to beanother form of the god himself. He also has two other servitors, Bviggir (\"barley\") and his wife Beyla(bee),6 the personifications of both nourishment and drink.Statues of Freyr are usually ithyphallic, and those who worshipped him often carried small imagesof him about.The animals holy to Freyr are boar, horse, bull or ox, and stag. His own horse is called Blodhughofi (1)bloody-hoofed), and he also rides on the boar Gullinbursti (Golden-bristled), which is said to be able torun through the air and over the sea faster than a horse.7 He wields a hart's horn in place of his sword, andit is said that he killed the giant Beli with this weapon. The stag's antlers put up at the corners of the hallHeorot 8 were probably a sign of dedication to Freyr, the more likely so as Scyld Scefing, the father ofHrothgar's line, has been identified with several Vanic figures.FREYJAThe goddess Freyja was probably the most widely worshipped of the Norse goddesses. If she had aknown true name other than her title of \"Lady,\" she would lik&y be identified with Nerthus.As Odhinn is the most magical of the gods, Freyja is most magical of the goddesses. She is awanderer in search of her husband Odhr, who is of course Odhinn himself as lord of mysticalinspiration.9 As Odhinn seeks out the hidden wisdom in the Vanic realm of the dead, so Freyja seeks theactive power and wisdom of the Aesir-the ultimate mingling of these mights being found in the formulaof Odhroerir. She is the mistress of seidh-magic, which she teaches to Odhinn, presumably receiving hisknowledge of runic magic in turn. She has the feathers of a falcon, which she can put on to fly forththrough the worlds; at one point she lends them to Loki.The goddess Freyja goes by many names: Guilveig, Heidh the witch, Heithrun (a she-goat),Vanadis (goddess of the Vanir), Horn (flax), Mardoll (sea-light?), Gefn (giver) and Syr (sow),10 amongothers. Most of these names are probably forms by which the goddess was known in different locations,even as Frigg was known by a number of names and forms; she is said to have gone by several differentnames in her search for Odhr. The goddess Gefjun may also be one of her hypostases. Although Gefjun issaid to be a virgin in theProse Edda,Loki accuses her of selling herself for a necklace11 and Odhinnspeaks of her foresight)2 There is also a tale in which this goddess has four oxen-sons by a giant for thepurpose of ploughing out a chunk of Sweden to make the island Zealand.13Freyja is a goddess of fertility and sexual pleasure above all else. She is said to have slept with all theAesir and all the alfs and to have lain with her brother Freyr as well,14 an incestuous union like that ofNerthus and Njord1 which is furthermore the formula for the birth of a hero (cf. Sinfjotli, Hrolf Kraki).(The story of her giving her body to four dwarves for the necklace Brisingamen has been discussed underkenaz, p. 65 .) She also takes mortal men for her lovers, and it may be that the role of her consort wasexpected of her priests, as the priestess of Freyr was described as his wife. Like Idunn, she is the object ofgiants' attempts at theft. This is not only due to her beauty but also to the fact that she is the embodimentof the basic life- force which is necessary to the gods.In the same manner as Freyr, Freyja is as mighty in battle as in love. Her hall is called Folkvangnand she claims one half of the slain in every battle, Odhinn taking the other half. (She also receives thesouls of unmarried women.) She rides to the battlefield in a chariot drawn by two cats; also upon a boar141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"called Hildisvini (Battle-swine). Freyja is particularly called upon today by women who wish to regainthe strength which Christian culture has denied them for so long. In the mighty figure of this goddess youmay find proof that the Teutonic path is neither patriarchal nor oppressive to women, but rather that itbrings out the female power both as the source of life and as the woman's warrior- might.Animals sacred to Freyja are the sow, the cat, the falcon, the swallow, and the cuckoo.In magic Freyja is often called upon in matters having to do with love, prosperity, and women'smysteries, especially seidhrmagic. Different aspects of her power are discussed further under the runesfehu, kenaz, and berkano.SKADHIAlthough Skadhi is not herself one of the Vanir, she is classed among them because of her marriage toNjord. She is the daughter of the jotun Thjazi. It has been considered that like Ullr, she was one of theoriginal gods of Scandinavia, possibly Finnish in origin, and Branston even claims that she was theeponymous founder of Scandinavia: Skadinauja. Her name may mean \"Shadow\" or \"Scathe\"; she is thegoddess of snowshoes and a great huntress with the bow. She rules the high mountain regions and thefarthest pathways.Skadhi came armed to the Aesir seekingweregildfor her father Thjazi, whom they had slain. She set twoconditions: The first was that the gods should make her laugh, the second that she might choose one ofthem as her husband. To fulfill the first condition, Loki tied one end of a rope to his testicles and the otherto a goat and the grotesque antics performed by the two of them until the rope broke and Loki tumbledinto her lap finally made her laugh. Here one may see the formula of ingwaz again: the mock castrationand the surrender of the fiery masculine to fertilize the frozen feminine. The husband Skadhi wished wasBaldr-a solar figure-but shehad to choose her husband by his feet alone, and it so happened that thehandsomest pair of feet belonged to Njord. This is, obviously, part of the ancient fertility ritualsymbolized by the bare footprint. They married and lived comfortably for a while, but since Skadhi couldnot bear to live by the sea and Njord could not bear the howling of the wolves and wind in her mountainhome Thrymheim1 the two ifnally separated.In the tale of Njord and Skadhi one can see the relationship between isa and laguz, ice and water.The two are closely connected (the rivers of Hvergelmir flow out of Nifiheim, the realm of primal ice) butnot compatible: the nature of the yeasty waters is to seethe and bring forth life; though ice holds all thatwater is within it its nature is to still and May. They are wedded, but must remain separate. It is fiery Lokiwho must make Skadhi able to accept Njord, and indeed he claims later to have slept with her;16 herdesire is to the bright Baldr. It is also claimed that she had sons with Odhinn,17 and it is fitting that thegoddess of winter should mate with the god who is known by the wild winter winds.When Loki is bound by the guts of his son(as suggested by Skadhi), it is she who hangs a snake todrip venom onto his face as a torment, perhaps in revenge for the role he claimed in the death of herfather. She is not only huntress but a just, if harsh, avenger. Perhaps surprisingly, she was worshipped in anumber of places in eastern Sweden;~8-she speaks of her \"ve's (holy enclosures) and fields\" 19Skadhi may be called upon, together with Ullr, to hallow a hunt, and extreme cases, to wreak arighteous, if cruel, revenge. Ingvar Solve lngvisson suggests that on occasions when a criminal is beingjustly executed, a blessing be offered to Skadhi (or else Vali) in order to hallow the awe-full act of life-taking.20 Despite her dark and woe-working character, she is fair and a trustworthy ally.Besides the Aesir and the Vanir, there were a few other gods who were recognized by the Teutonicpeoples, and who might be prayed and sacrificed to even though they were not generally the objects ofcultic worship.AEGIR; RANAegir (the Terrifying), also called Hler (the Shelterer) and Gymir (the Concealing), is a god of the sea. Heis probably older than Njord and is described several times as a giant. As Le~ he is one of the three sonsof the giant Fornjot, the other two being Kari (wind) and Loge (fire), who embody the Gdhinn/Hoenir/142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Lodurr airi water/fire triad on the level of elemental forces. Njord rules the bounty of the sea; Aegirpersonifies the sea itself. He is less well- wishing than Njord, though not as cruel and greedy as his wifeRan (robber).Aegir and Ran take those who die in shipwrecks, and it was customary for sailors to hide a little bitof gold about them during storms so that Ran might welcome them well if they were drowned. Aegir'shall is lit with shining gold, and thus gold is called Aegir's Fire. He is the brewer of ale for the Aesir andis associated with the rune laguz. The daughters of Aegir and Ran are the nine waves, who may also bethe mothers of Heimdallr.Ran carries a net with which to catch the drowned. Aegir is associated with the great cauldron inwhich he brews ale, which may be related to the cauldrons of plenty in Irish legend.SOL; MANISol (Anglo-Saxon Sunna) and Mani are the personifications of the Sun and the Moon. It should beremembered that in all Germanic languages and cultures, the Sun itself is feminine, while the Moon ismasculine. Although it is not uncommon for some neo-pagans to identify this or that Teutonic goddesswith a moon goddess (Paul Schroeder), it is thoroughly incorrect. There arenomoon goddesses in theTeutonic pantheon; the concept is linguistically and culturally impossible.Sol is called \"the shining goddess\" from whose fires the earth is protected by the shield Svalin,\"Cooler.\" She is drawn in a wain by two horses, Arvakr (Early-Awake) and Alsvith (Very Swift),~ andpursued by the wolf Skoll.Mani is said to measure the time of the Moon's waxing and waning. In Teutonic thought, the Moonis not associated with emotion and the subconscious but with measurement regulation, and reason. He isattended by the two water-bearing children Hjuki and Bil, who are thought to be Jack and Jill of the folkrhyme. Mani is pursued by the wolf Hati Hrodhvitnisson (son of Fenris), also called Managarm, \"Moon'sDog.\"22143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"18: WIGHTS OF HELPThe termdisirmeans \"goddesses\"; it is applied to goddesses of a Vanic character, as distinct from theAsynjur who are the Aesic goddesses (though Freyja is sometimes classed among these). These goddessesare generally tied to a family. They rule the fertility of the land and the prosperity and success ofindividual houses. They often seem to be the spirits of particularly powerful female ancestors who, ratherthan going to their appointed halls, have chosen to stay among the beings of the earth and continue toeither work weal towards their descendants or call them to death when theirweirdsare dreed. They are, asit were, handmaidens of Nerthus who hold the powers of fertility, prosperity, and death.The disir are not only ancestral spirits, however; Freyja is called \"Vanadis,\" dis of the Vanir, andHel is referred to as \"jodis\", dis of the horse-that animal being of course used in funeral rites a great deal.It may be that the female ancestral spirits become blended with the Vanic goddesses in the same way thatsome male spirits blend with the Alfar. They are also associated with the Norns that come to every childthat is born in order to shape its life. It is said that the good Norns that come from good stock shape goodlives, but those that meet with misfortune owe it to the evil Norns.1 These Norns are associated with theVanic powers of the elves and dwarves, or Alfar and Svartalfar, to which the disir are closely related.There was an active cult of the disir: they were especially worshipped at the Winternights festival.Their worship was mostly presided over by women, although men also made sacrifices to them.Sometimes adisarsalar(hall of the dis) was built for this purpose, but the worship of the disir was usuallycarried out in the individual home, since they were the goddesses of the family. In later pagan times thesacrifice was that of a bull or ox, and mead or ale are currently used; however, in earlier times, they mayhave received human sacrifice. The Ynglinga Saga states that during onedisablot,Adhils, king of theSwedes was thrown and killed while riding his horse around the hall of the goddess. The horse's stumblewas blamed on a witch,2 but there is no way to tell whether this was arranged as a royal sacrifice orwhether the attendant dis took her sacrifice by force. There is a later story in which the eldest sonThidhrandi heard a knock at the door on the Winternights festival and went out, although everyone hadbeen warned to stay inside. He was set upon and mortally wounded by nine black-clad women on horses,while nine dressed in white stood by. The prophet(spamadhr)who was present at the feast told the familythat the women were the disk of the family, the black being those who clung to the old religion and werenot willing to be defrauded of their sacrifice in years to come, and the white, those who awaited the newreligion.3The Christian influence in the tale of Thidhrandi is obvious; however, the disir arecharacteristically divided into those who aid in life and those who call one to the grave, the former beingdressed in shining garments and the latter in black. If the disir are provoked to turn against members oftheir household, the result is death.The disir are closely associated with the kinfylgja and at times confused with her, as is thehamingja. The difference is that the kinfylgja is a single being who usually is attached to one member ofthe household for the duration of his (always male; women are more directly connected to the disir-power) life, while the disir are plural and look over the welfare of the entire family. The kinfylgja issometimes called the hamingja, but she is the collective haming ia-power of the ancestors embodied in aself-aware form, rather than the \"luck\" or mana of the individual hamingja.The disir often appear as women in dreams; they are also calleddraumkonur(dream-women). Theyare more likely to appear to a man's wife than to the man himself. They prophesy victory or death, andamong the Germanic tribes they were also said to aid in battle in the same manner as valkyrjur,strengthening their charges and laymg fetters on their enemies. The disir Thorgerd Horgabrudhr (\"bride ofthe altar\") and Yrp, ancestral spirits of the Haleygir, were called forth by sacrifice made by the JarlHaakon Sigurdsson during a battle and appeared in a raging hailstorm from the north, arrows flying fromtheir fingertips. [4]The disir may be called upon for wisdom or help atneed,although the same cautions should beobserved in their case as when making sacrifice to the gods. The Rite of Disir-Redes may be found inChapter 21.144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"ALFARThe Alfar are divided into three races: Ljosalfar, Dokkalfar, and Svartalfar, or Light Elves, Dark Elves,and Black Elves, the last being also called dwarves.The wordAlfmay be derived from a root meaning \"shining\" or \"white,\" being related to the Latinalbusand Sanskritrhbu.Ingvisson suggests here that a connection may also exist between the originalCeltic name for Scotland, Alba, and the Alfar-folk. It is also possible, however, that \"alf\" is derived fromthe Indo-European*lbh-/*lehb-/*lobh-,which means \"to cheat\" or \"to be cunning.\"5 At different timesand in different forms the Alfar fit both of these descriptions. They are commonly thought to be the causeof sickness; their arrows (elf-shot) cause stroke and paralysis, and the Anglo-Saxons had a number ofcharms which were meant to heal the ills given by elves. All the Alfar are wise magicians. They willfrequently take an interest in individual humans, as shown by such names as Aelfrede (Elf-counsel),Aelfgifu (Elf-gift), and so forth. The Alfar are also unpredictable, taking pleasure or offense at theslightest things; your manners and bearing are exceedingly important in dealing with these wights.The first distinction made between the races of the Alfar must be between the Ljosalfar andSvartalfar, who are created independently of humankind, and the Dokkalfar, the mound-elves, who havemuch in common with the disir, being thought to be in some aspects the masculine counterparts of thesebeings. The clearest account of a human becoming numbered among the mound-elves is the story of OlafGudrudsson, a minor king who, after his death, was called the Elf of Geirstadhir and to whom sacrificewas made for good harvests. Other accounts, however, show that the mound-elves were not whollymasculine nor wholly human in origin, and it is likely that what occurs in cases such as Olaf's is similar towhat occurs with the disir: when a human has become altogether identified with the land and itsfruitfulness in life, that person, if buried in a mound, may remain with the Vanic spirits who dwell thereand rule over those things, becoming one of the Doickalfar. It is these elves to whom blessings are madefor healing and good harvest, and probably these elves to whom the autumn alfablot (held, like thedisablot, at Winternights) was given.The Dokkalfar dwell in mounds, hillocks, and rocks. They are great magicians and teachers ofmagic, and it may have been to their abodes that Odhinn refers when he says that he learned his wisdomfrom the \"men, very old men, / who dwell in the wood of the home.\"6 Blessings may be made to theDokkalfar in one's own home, or one may seek out a place where they dwell if one wishes to ask a favorfrom them. The best time to approach them is at sunset for they are not fond of daylight. They appear asvery beautiful, though pale, humanlike wights in noble clothes (the term \"Dark Alfar\" refers to theirabodes, not their appearance or moral character, despite the attempts of modern fantasy writers to attach itto one or the other of the latter characteristics). They may be seen at their dwellings or in dreams after onehas made a sacrifice to them, The Dokkalfar at times need the help of humans, and they always repaysuch help richly.The Ljosalfar are wights of light, air, and thought who dwell in Ljosalfheimr, the upper reaches ofMidgardhr's atmosphere, which is ruled by Freyr. It is these Alfar who are often spoken of together withthe Aesir, whose spiritual dwelling borders on Asgardhr. Unlike the Dokkalfar and Svartalfar, they lovethe brightness of the Sun, and they are sometimes seen at the festival of Ostara as white- clad women inthe far reaches of the hills. They are often, though not always, personified as feminine, in contrast to theSvartalfar, who are almost always masculine. The Ljosalfar are the keepers and teachers of wisdom, andthey are the source of earthly inspiration, as the Svartalfar are the source of earthly manifestation. It isprobably from these wights that the Anglo-Saxon adjectiveaelfsciene,\"bright as an elf,\" was firstderived.The Ljosalfar communicate with humans in dreams and sudden bursts of inspiration. They mayappear as shining4air humans or as flashes of light-colored brightness.Of the Svartalfar or Dvergar, there has been more written than about their kin. They were created by thegods out of the maggots that had crawled through the flesh of the slain Ymir. They are very clever smiths,who forged Freyja's necklace, Thor's hammer, Sifs hair, Freyr's ship, and a hoard of other treasures of thegods. Their dwelling, Svartalfheim, is beneath Midgardhr's surface, and it is there that they hoard theirgold and jewels. The dwarves are the earthly craft and power which give shape and being to theinspiration of the Ljosalfar. It was Svartalfar who slew Kvasir and made the mead Odhroerir from hisblood (kenaz), transforming the raw material of wisdom into the craft and art of poetry from which any145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"who could might drink. Thekoboldsof the German mines maybe classed as Svartalfar, as may all of theknocking spirits heard in subterranean works.The Svartalfar are said to be miserly and grudging, as well as more ill-tempered than the otherraces of Alfar. The worddwarfis etymologically connected with the idea of harming, oppressing, ormaliciously deceiving.7 Like the Dokkalfar, they are skilled in magic, having learned the runes throughthe dwarf Dvalin, and they know magical songs; unlike them, they almost never willingly teach theirmagical knowledge, though at times they may teach the art of smithing to a mortal. The name \"Gandalf\"meaning Wand-Elf or Sorcerer-Elf, was originally the name of a Norse dwarf!8 It is not uncommon forthe Svartalfar to curse things that they are forced to make, such as the sword Tyrfing, or that are stolenfrom them, such as Andvari's hoard. They are also said to steal human women and children, perhapsbecause there are few dwarvish women. Yet although they are often untrustworthy, viciously vengeful,and malicious, they can be surprisingly loyal and friendly to humans who treat them well.Sacrifice is seldom made to Svartalfar, except in rituals where all the Alfar are honored together,such as the Alfablot in Thorsson' 5Book of Troth.In matters of craft it is best to call upon the Ljosalfarand the Svartalfar together, as the two are complementary forces. The Svartalfar are said to be dark ofcomplexion, ugly, perhaps twisted; they often appear as short but very powerful men with long graybeards.LANDVAETTIRThe namelaudvaettirmeans \"wights of the land.\" In this group can be classed all the beings who guardcertain places, those who are bound to rocks, streams or trees, and the lesser nature spirits in general.They are very clearly distinguished from the ancestral wights: Indeed, the landvaettir seem to have beenmost powerful in Iceland, where humans had just arrived. It was written in the pagan law of Iceland(roughly 930 C.E.) that the dragon heads of ships had to be removed before the ships came into sight ofland, so as not to frighten the landvaettir. At one point King Harald Gormsson hired a wizard who went toIceland in the form of a whale to spy out the land, and who saw that all the mountains and hills were fullof land-wights, both large and small. At every place where the wizard attempted to come to land he wasattacked – by a dragon heading a herd of poisonous beasts; by a huge bird and an army of birds; by amountain giant and an army of giants. 9 These were the native landvaettir of Iceland, who were thus seento be so strong that it would be useless to attack the country. Landvaettir have been known to befriend particular humans, helping all things to go well for themin their daily lives. One example of this was the Icelander Beorn, who dreamt that a giant came to himand asked him to be his partner. He agreed, and was thus befriended by the vaettir, who followed him andhis brothers about and could easily be seen by those with second sight. Bloody sacrifice was not offeredto these wights, but it was very common to leave a bit of food or pour out ale in front of those placeswhich they were especially known to frequent, or else go to these places, hallow the food to them, and eatit oneself. Rocks, trees, waterfalls and sometimes streams or wells are the commonest dwelling places ofthe Landvaettir. It was thought that they would not stay in a place where someone had been slain, whetherfrom anger or from fear is uncertain. In modern times they are not likely to dwell too near majorhighways or where there is a great deal of pollution or disturbance; however they do not shun humancompany and do not object to houses, roads and such as long as their holy places are not destroyed so thatthese may be built. The Landvaettir are visible to the sensitive and to those faring forth from their bodies. They alsoappear in dreams. They do not change shape, but an individual landvaettr may appear as almost anything.VALKYRJURThe concept of the valkyrja is one of the most complicated in Teutonic thought. The name means\"chooser of the slain\" and the most widely accepted description of the valkyrja is that she(or they;valkryjur often ride in troops of nine or three times nine)rides on horseback over the battlefield, takingthose whom Odhinn wishes for his own to Valhalla. Valkyrjur can be seen by those who are sighted in therealms of the spirit; they usually appear in times of strife and storm. Like Odhinn, they first appear asfurious and warlike, characteristics which never entirely vanish from them. The names of the valkyrjur inthe Grimnismal include Skogul (the Raging One), Hlokk (the Shrieker), and Hild (battle). Before the146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"battle of Clontarf twelve valkyrjur are seen weaving a web of human entrails, the reels and shuttles ofwhich are arrows and a sword, the spindles spears, and the warp weighted with men's heads. As theyweave they sing a song of prophecy about the battle to come, and finish by tearing the cloth in two - sixcarrying one half to the North and six to the south.10As weavers and choosers of men's deaths, they are associated with the Norns, and Skuld is thename of a Norn and a valkyrja alike. Only with the aid of the valkyrja can a mortal human cross Bifrost ashas been mentioned earlier. Within Valhalla, they bear drink to Odhinn and theeinherjar(his chosenwarriors). The valkyrjur hover invisibly over the heads of their chosen warriors and shield them both inbattle and from magic. They are often said to wear swan dresses when flying out to battle. The valkyrjaSigrdrifa teaches magical wisdom to Sigurdhr. In the cycle of the Helgi lays and the story of Sigurdhr,one sees these magical maidens in mortal bodies from which they fare forth to shield the hero who isdestined for them. The hero and his valkyrja are reborn, meet again, and live out their lives togetherseveral times, though his is always shortened by violence either as a direct or an indirect result of hismating with her.The valkyrja is best understood as a guardian spirit and personification of that in the soul which is closestto Odhinn, as both her furor and her mystical wisdom show. Like the fylgja, with whom she has much incommon, she is a semi-independent being who is capable of going forth on her own. She often acts inways of which the ordinary person is altogether unaware, except as symbolically shown by the tales ofthese battle-maids. One of the greatest goals of the male vitki is to be \"wed\" to his valkyrja-to consciouslyreach her, learn from her, and be led upward by her; the goal of the female vitki is to become consciouslyone with her valkyrja-to be a valkyrja in the sense that the title is given to mortal women. Those with asubtle understanding of this will know that these purposes are not necessary different; but the humanmind is normally so constructed that they call for different forms of symbolic expression.When the valkyrja is seen, she usually appears as a shiningly fair woman dressed in armor andcarrying weapons. If the weapons are bloody, it foretells a battle.147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"19: OUTDWELLERSThe concept of the innangardhs and the utangardhs has been somewhat discussed under Nine Worlds ofYggdrasil (see Chapter 1). The innangardhs is the realm of ordered space, social structure, the human, andthe known; the utangardhs is the realm of disorder, the unhuman, the uncanny, and the unknown. It is thewild world of the forest and the outlaw. It is also the realm into which you fare to gain wisdom andmagical power as does Odhinn. Magic is, indeed, by nature characteristic of the utangardhs, as orderedreligion is of the innangardhs. Those wights which are specifically characterized as \"outdwellers\" arethose whose beings are strongly contradictory to the ordered nature of the innangardhs. However, youshould never forget that not only are parts of the vitki's own being - such as the fylgja and even thevalkyrja in some aspect closely akin to the outer world, but the most powerful mediator between therealms is the vitki her/himself.~ Hastrup further points out that only one who is him/herself a part of theutangardhs can effectively deal with its uncanny wights, as seen in the Grettis Saga in which Grettir is theonly human who can deal with the malicious trolls and ghosts troubling more ordered folk, preciselybecause he is an outlaw and thus sib to these beings.2 Likewise, a number of the greatest Teutonic heroesbear markings or come from families which tie them to the powers of the utangardhs, and it is preciselyfrom this that they derive their uncanny might, even as the gods must often turn to the jotuns for mates.THE VARGRPerhaps the most characteristic inhabitant of the utangardhs was the wight called thevargr.This termmeans wolf,\" though it. has a more brutal connotation than the standardulfr;it was also used colloquiallyto mean \"outlaw,\" which may have been its original sense. Etymologically it is connected to u-argr,\"restless,\"3 which should at once lead the mind back to Odhinn. The heaviest form of outlawry was calledskoggangr(\"forest-going\"); one who had been outlawed was a forest-man or an outlying man, the latterterm being used for any wight who lived outside the bounds of society, whether as outlaw, robber, oruncanny being. The termutilegja(\"lying out\") is also related to the sitting-out of seidh-magic4 (seeChapter 14). The outlaw, being outside of the gardhn had ceased to be human; he is \"wod-frekawerewulf\"-the fury-greedy werewolf- in the laws of Canute wulf-heafod (wolf's head) among the Anglo-Saxons.It is obvious that the vargr (outlaw) is closely related to and frequently the same as the vargr(ravening wolf). He is, in fact, often a skin-changer or a berserker. (The vargr is almost always a he in thestories-although women often have wolf-fylgur, they ordinarily ride on their backs rather than putting ontheir skins, and only one vague poetic reference to a female berserker exists.)5 The Volsunga Sagadescribes how Sigmundr and Sinfjotli become outlaws for a time, when Sigmundr wishes to test thestrength of his son, and how the two of them find a house in which other outlaws are sleeping withwolfskins hung over their heads. The Volsungs steal the skins and put them on, turning into wolves, andgo forth from there to kill some more travellers. By putting on the skin of an animal in company with theproper ritual, one can either fare forth in its shape or draw the fylgja-mind into oneself to become aberserker. Those who do this are calledeigi einhamir,\"not of one skin.\" This is a trait which is passeddown through family lines, so that one sees genealogies such as Bjorn, son of Ulfhedhinr (Wolf-skin-coat,another name for a berserker) son of Ulfhamr (Wolffiide/shape) son of Ulf (Wolf) son of Ulfhamr whocould change forms.6 Unfortunately, those who received this heavy gift of Odhinn's in the lattergenerations were (and are) usually untrained and unable to control it; the ability to control it usually camethrough initiation into the secret cults of the Germanic warrior-band.The berserker is not always an outlaw, but he is always outside the bonds of society, and the rules ofthe innangardhs do not bind him as they bind other people. It was not uncommon for berserkers to roamthrough the land, challenging peaceful farmers toholmgang(ritual single combat), which the victim couldonly escape by forfeiting all he had to the challenger. The berserker was a fearsome opponent: hecharacteristically gnawed at the edge of his shield, frothing at the mouth In his battle-trance he had themind of the creature which was his fylgja, usually a wolf or a bear. His strength was several times greaterthan normal, he did not feel blows, and those berserkers who were especially skilled in trance and battle-148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"magic entered a state in which weapons would not bite on him. When combat was over he becameexhausted and frequently passed out for a time.The berserker fury is one of the oldest aspects of the cult of Odhinn. The Heruli, who were also thefirst runemasters and possibly the greatest spreaders of Odhinn-worship, cultivated the practice offighting with only shield and cloak as protection. The best latter-day example of the tie between theberserkergang, runic magic, and Odhinn's other gift of poetry can be found in the family line of EgillSkallagrimson. Egill's grandfather, named Ulfr, was said to be cheerful and active during the day butgiven to fits of uncontrollable savagery and drowsiness as evening approached. Because of this, \"peoplesaid that he was much given to changing form(hamrammr),so he was called Kveldulfr (EveningWolf).\"7 This would refer to Kveldulfr faring forth in the form of a wolf; later in the saga it is describedthat he became a berserker in battle, although he was an old man and the strain killed him shortly after.Kveldulfr had two sons, one of whom, Skallagrimr, took after him in both appearance and temperament,and who was prone to berserkergang not only in battle but also in games. Egill Skallagrimson was darkand ugly, like his father and grandfather but unlike his brother and uncle. He is not described as aberserker in his saga, but he was possibly the greatest of Old Norse poets and certainly of runemasterswithin written history.In modern times, the path of the berserker is not to be followed by anyone who has not been subject togreat physical discipline(such as intensive martial arts training) in conjunction with the magical andspiritual disciplines of Odhinn. Even in the wilder times of the Germanic tribes and Vikings, berserkerswere viewed with mistrust and often horror; one can imagine how someone like Skallagrimr, who becametoo excited in a game and began to kill people, would be treated now. For almost everyone now,knowledge of the berserkergang is only useful inasmuch as it throws light on the process of shape-changing and faring forth in the fylgja or another hide(hamr).THE LIVING DEADAmong the Teutonic undead are ghosts, which are souls without bodies, anddraugar,which are deadbodies animated by part of the human soul. The ghost would seem to be the hamr or hide, sometimestogether with the mind and sometimes lingering as a sort of spiritual memory of a person's death. TheEyrbygga Saga describes men drowned to sea who came, dripping wet, to drink the Yule ale and werewelcomed by their relatives. The Faereyinga Saga tells of how a Faroese magician summoned the ghostsof three missing men to see how they had died; two were dripping wet, but the third was bloody and heldhis head in his hand, showing that he had swum to shore and been slain there. These ghosts do not seemto hear or speak, and if they are motivated it is in the vaguest sort of way.Spirits also appear without hamr(form) but as fiery shapes, like will-o-the-wisps.8 These would bethe hamingjur of the dead which have no thought, and barely feeling. Although they have no lich or hamrto sustain their forces, they may try to steal hamingja-power from whatever is around them. This beingthe case, it accounts for the cold felt in the presence of some dead, which are themselves felt as warmspots; it is a sort of low keyed and semi-sentient vampirism.The dead are often thought of as living inside their barrows. In a lay of Helgi Hundingsbana, the deadman's wife Sigrun goes into his barrow. He stays there with her at night, but he and his followers ride upto Valhalla to fight in the daytime. Barrows are sometimes seen open, with lights burning within. In thesecases those who dwell inside are written of as feasting and joyous. These, however, do not fall into therealm of outdwellers but are rather a continuance of social order: one is with one's ancestors or in on&shome. These dead stay where they are and do not trouble the living, though they may give theirdescendants gifts or good advice; they often overlap with the Dokkalfar. Only when the barriers arebroken-when the living enter the barrow uninvited or to steal from the dead-do the dwellers within thehowe become ill-wishing. The most terrifying sort of Teutonic undead is thedraugr,the living corpse. The body of this wightdid not decay, although it might show signs of death such as swelling or changing color. The draugr isinhumanly strong and often hungry for living flesh and blood-the vehicles of the hamingja force. Like theloose hamingja, its touch is cold, stealing life and courage. It is also said to be ringed with fire, thehamingja-force that enlivens it. Sometimes it is held to its barrow; often it walks and kills whatever it canfind outside, banging on the roofs and doors of houses and trying to break in. With some exceptions, this149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"being can be described as the lich(body) enlivened by hamingja-force and possibly hamr, but without anyof the conscious aspects of the soul. The true draugr does not recognize people who were known to it inlife, nor, with only a few exceptions, can it speak. The Egill's Saga tells how Skallagrimr's corpse wastaken out through the broken wall, apparently so that if he should walk after death, he would come to thewall and not the door-the blind movement of the undead's instinct. Although no overt connection appearsbetween the berserker or skin-changer and the undead in Germanic myth, as in Slavic countries where itis thought that a werewolf will become a vampire after death, precautions are frequently taken to preventanyone with uncanny powers from walking: the corpses of witches are often staked down with rune-carved sticks, heads cut off, and so forth.The Grettis Saga describes Grettir's fights with two wights who are said to bedraugar,although theydiffer from the usual walking dead in their level of awareness and mental activity. The first is Karr theOld, who has characteristics of both draugr and Dokkalf. Although he is clearly described and seems toact as an undead, his hauntings are carried out for the sole purpose of increasing his son's holdings, andhis son's wish is enough to act as a warding for others. Grettir slays this wight by cutting his head off andclapping it alongside the draugr's thigh, a traditional means of laying these beings.9 The second, Clam, isthe mighty and vicious draugr of a mighty and vicious man who was slain by an unnatural being on thefirst night of Yule. His body was found, blue and swollen, but so heavy that it could not be moved, whichis one of the usual traits of draugar. Glam walked for two years, more in the autumm and winter and lessin the bright seasons, slaying men and destroying farms, and finally Grettir came to grapple with him.Grettir eventually overcame Glam by wrestling, but when their eyes met by moonlight he was horribly dismayed (compare with the eyes of the sorceror). The saga says that there was more fiendish craft inGlam than in most other ghosts, giving him the ability to speak to Grettir. Glam cursed Grettir so that heshould never grow in strength, that he should always be an outlaw and alone, and that he should alwayssee Glam's eyes before his own, which left him with a hideous terror of being alone in the dark.10Glam is an exceptional draugr, as he seems to have become undead by his own will and strength,thus retaining something of a mind and the power to curse. In most cases the draugr is mindless, seemingto be accidentally created when the hamingja for some reason or other remains with the body. Otherwise,the lich is sometimes animated by a sorceror for the purpose of working woe, and the hamingja filling itmight be that of the sorceror or of a sacrifice. This is not to be confused with Odhinn's practice of carvingrunes to make the dead speak, or of summoning up ghosts; those works are concerned with the actualmind of the dead person, and any other parts, body or soul, are incidentals which make communicationbetween the living and the dead easier. When the consciousness of the dead person is willingly present, itis usually in the setting of disir, Dokkalfar, or other well-wishing barrow wights. However, disturbmg thedead or angering them is very dangerous, and even a magical circle is not always warding enough whenyou have called an unwilling ghost up to Midgardhr. In workings with the undead, runic magic was moreoften called upon to prevent their workings or to keep them from doing harm than to create them.JOTUNSThe termjotunis used in English as a general description of the descendants of Ymir. These beingsembody the proto-forces of the universe before it was divided into utangardhs and innangardhs. They arethus chaotic by nature and belong to the world of the utangardhs now. In general, it can be said that theyembody the raw forces of wild nature.The jotuns are loosely divided into three separate races, although these frequently blurred, especiallyunder the demands of the Norse poetic form. Nevertheless the functions and nature of these beings can beclearly seen, even though the terminology has broken down. In Runelore, Thorsson classifies them asetins(ONjotunn,jotnar),which he writes forth as ageless, non-evolving beings of great power, wisdom,and magic;rises,the characteristic \"giants\" of legend; andthurses,the unintelligent antagonists ofconscious- ness and order, which are further divided intorime-thursesandfirethurses.Risir commonlydwell in mountains and cliffs, rime-thurses among the rocks in cold, icy places. lilsir sometimes matewith humans, and the hero Starkadh was the grandson of such a pairing. The gods frequently mate withetins and risir, and none of the Aesir are without some trace of the blood of the jotun kindred.The nature of etins and risir varies as drastically as the nature of any other highly conscious class ofbeing. Some, like Aegir and the wise etin Mimir, are helpful to the gods; others, like Utgardsloki and150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Surtr, are their foes. The thurses, on the other hand, are always foe to the innangardhs.~~ Loki is of therace of etins, and he may be taken as in many ways characteristic of that kind, although his light andhumorous side is not generally seen as a part of etinish nature.With individual exceptions such as Mimir,there is no reason to make blessings to any of the jotunish kindred; their types and names may, however,be used as specifics in banishing (etins ilL Thrym's kin, and so on), and it was also the custom in cursingto threaten one's foes with mating a particularly loathsome thurse such as Hrim grimmnir12 or Lothi, \"theHairy.\" 3 Also, it should be remembered that humans as well as Aesir partake of the jotunish heritagethrough our godly ancestry. It is thus our part to seek (as Odhinn does) after the wisdom and might heldby the etins and risir, as well as that of the gods.OTHER OUTOWELLERSGRENDEL, GRENDEL'S DAMThe first two monsters with whom Beowulf fights are beautifully typical of the outdweller. They arenumbered among the \"children of Cain,\" a Christianization of the outdweller concept which neverthelesscarries the sense of the original thought of outcast/outlaw well, encompassing \"giants, elves, ettins, orcs,rocs\" 4 as well as the monstrous Grendel himself. Grendel is called variouslyeotonandthyrs;like aberserker, he and his mother are both invulnerable to ordinary weapons. They are dwellers in a stagnantmere, the abode of the worst Teutonic water-wights (see laguz).These two are particularly terrible because they are not kept out by the walls of the innangardhs,but must rather be slain by its guardian, Beowuif, who has certain characteristics in common with Grettir,although he is a far more socialized and reasonable figure. Like Grettir, he was said to have been a lazychild; he had superhuman strength which made him a fit bodily match for monsters. Beowuifs prowess isgreatest in the water, in which he is initiated in shamanic fashion; 15 this is his heritage from theutangardhs, and because of it he can vanquish the water-monsters, only being slain at last by a wyrm offlame and earth.TROLLSThe Troll is a Scandinavian breed of wight which is in many ways similar to the jotun kindred, thoughusually smaller and less fearsome. \"Troll\" is also a term used to describe most things uncanny-a witch orsomeone else's dis will be called a troll-wife, while bad weather is still \"trowie weather\" in theShetlands.16 Again, the name of troll is sometimes used interchangeably with that of etin, ris, or thurs.The trolls are able to possess people, as well as drag them off and kill them. Like theberserkergang, this possession was supposed to be extinguished by baptism; and it may be that the twowere related, as it was possible for a person to have a troll as fylgja. \"Trolls take you!\" is a common curse,but there is no way to tell whether it means mental possession or simply murder.Trolls range from small and rather comical creatures to large and ferocious wights which havemuch in common with their cousins the thurses. They are often ugly and misshapen, though not always;like all the races of Ymir's children, the troll kindred has a few among it who are both beautiful and wise.They dwell inside of mountains, hills, and hillocks. The sun turns them to stone.Trolls can do favors for mortals and sometimes breed with them: troll-women seduce human men,and troll men often capture human women. There are several people called Half-Troll in the sagas. Grettirhimself was sheltered for a while in the valley of the halftroll Thorir.HULDRU-FOLKThe Huldru-folk (hidden people) or Elle (alder)-folk are halfway in nature between trolls and landvaettir,They are peoples of the mound and forest, not slain by sunlight, but who often try to capture mortals bytricks and magic. These peoples are beautiful but usually deformed by animal parts or hollow backs. TheWood-folk of the German forests are similar to their Scandinavian cousins in both character and nature.All of these beings can be both helpful and harmful to humans, depending on their whims and how theyare treated. Food is sometimes left for them. They are keepers of magical wisdom, generally that relatedto the lore of plants and healmg, though they also cause sickness at times. 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"20: BEASTSIn Teutonic tradition, as among most people who live closely in tune with their own world, animals ofvarious kinds are known to have special elements to their beings which make them particularlyappropriate to the cults of certain gods, in certain magical workings, or as tutelary spirits. By knowing thegreatest beasts of the Teutonic world and the thoughts which our ancestors associated with them, you canenhance your workings and your own understanding. Often animals will be seen in visions or dreams, andthese beings must be understood if you are to receive the wisdom being given you.BEARThe Teutonic people thought of the bear as the greatest of the beasts. It is frequently the fylgja ofsomeone who is exceedingly strong, both in body and in mind. Along with the wolf, it is a commonfavorite of shape-changers and berserkers; one often finds Bjorn (bear) as a personal name. The bear isthought of as being similar to a human in intelligence, aware of honor and fairness. Although it is a beastof the utangardhs, it is not one of uncontrolled fury and destruction such as the wolf, but rather moregoodhumored and moderate. The name \"Beowulf' literally means \"beewol{\" which is a kenning for bear,and Beowulf is typical of bear-heroes in his strength and in that his strength is directed against monstersrather than men. Bjorn was also a side-name of of Thorr,1 although the bear was never specifically madeholy to him.BIRDS, lesserThe smaller birds, such as cuckoo, swallow, and titmouse, have the Vanic gifts of foresight and wisdom.Sigurdh is told by the woodfowl where the sleeping Sigrdrifa lies and that Reginn plans to murder him.2Folk beliefs still hold that the cries of the cuckoo can tell you the length of your life remaining andwhether good or ill will befall you.3 The robin is hallowed to Thorr; if you disturb its nest your house willbe struck by lightning.4 Shape-changers often take the forms of swallows.The flight and actions of birds of all sorts can be omens.The greater birds are more important to Teutonic magic and are spoken of individually.BOARThe boar is the greatest of the Vanic beasts, holy to Freyja and Freyr. According to legend, he taughthumans to plow by rooting up the earth with his tusks. He is also a fearsome warrior. The boar's head wasused on helmets, especially on those worn by the followers of the Vanic cult, to protect themselves inbattle and frighten their foes. One of these was named Hildisvini (Battle-swine), the name of Freyja's ownboar, and Davidson suggests that the story of Freyja disguising her lover Ottar as her mount really refersto the use of a boar-mask in Vanic ritual.5 Served at table, a boar's head cannot be carved by someonewho is not of clean reputation and tried bravery.CATThe cat is sacred to Freyja. The cats who drew her chariot have been mentioned earlier. Treating thesecreatures well will bring the goddess' blessing on one's love and marriage.The cat is frequently the fylgja of women and strongly tied to seidhr-magic. For this reason, it hasbeen thought of as the familiar of witches down to this day. Although the cat and its place in magic areusually feminine, there was one wizard, the Icelander Thorolf Skeggi, who had twenty black cats thatguarded him bravely when he was attacked. The cat is also seen as a sort of helpful home-sprite, servantand family luck in one.6CATTLEThe bull and the ox were frequently sacrificed to Freyr, Thon, and the disir or alfar. Like other animals ofgreat strength, these are very powerful fylgjur. War-chariots were drawn by oxen; the cow was alsohonored, and the hallowed cow Sibilja was even led into battle.7 The cow would seem to be associated152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"with Freyja, as Nerthus' wagon was drawn by kine. Milk is, obviously, a source of strength and vitalpower (see uruz). The horns of cows were decorated and adorned with gold and are still decked withflowers and ribbons today in Germanic areas.Tame cattle are spoken of further under fehu, the aurochs under uruz.DEERThe stag is the fylgja of a noble man or king. Helgi Hundingsbana is compared to the stag towering aboveall the other forest animals.8rt isholy to Freyr. Stag's antlers are put up, as at Heorot, to hallow a placeto him and call upon h is protection. After the loss of his sword, Freyr fought with the horn of a hart.According to one version of the Sigurdhr story, the hero was nursed by a hind in the woods. To thedying Fafflir, he names himself \"Stag\" (or \"noble animal\").9 He also appears as a stag in a dream, it beinghis animal fetch.Four harts gnaw at the bark of the World-Tree; these embody the entropic forces of earthly nature.The stag often leads the one who follows it to a magical place or to a vision, and it is notuncommon for otherworldly beings to take the shapes of deer in order to lure a hunter onward.EAGLEThe eagle is the greatest of birds. An eagle sits at the top of the World-Tree. The eye of the eagle is thefar-sighted, piercing, wise eye of the Teutonic hero, and the eagles scream at the hero's birth.11 In thehidden lore of the Teutonic people, the eagle is the bird embodying the noble one, the one who hasfulfilled her/his spiritual potential. It is associated with jera,12 being in fact this rune in its highest form.As the transformation of that which is hidden in earth to that whichfliesforth into the heavens as theirruler-the noblest bird-jera is the upward spiral of the eagle's path. This may be seen in the story ofOdhroerir, in which Odhinn brings the mead forth from inside the mountain and carries it back toValhalla as an eagle.The winds are often embodied as an eagle: Hraesvelg (Corpse-gulper), an etin in eagle's shape, sitsat the end of the world and the beating of his wings Mows forth all the winds.~3 Shetlanders are said tocall forth the storm wind as a great eagle. ~The eagle is a bird of Odhinn, and his followers sometimes made sacrifices to him by the carvingof the blood-eagle.The falcon shares many characteristics with the eagle, though it is usually feminine, whereas theeagle is most often shown as masculine.HORSEThe horse is associated especially with the worship of Freyr and of Odhinn. The god may take upresidence in the body of a horse, as is hinted at by the Freyfaxi (Frey-mane) of the Vatnsdaelasaga, whichwas worshipped by its owner, and that of Hrafnkell, which was hallowed to the god and which its slayershad to hood before pushing it over a cliff as a sorcerer would be hooded, in order to avoid the magic ofhis gaze. Horses were very often sacrificed, and the eating of horseflesh was the mark of a heathen, whichis why people of northern Christian countries have been brainwashed to react to the thought of eatinghorse with revulsion. The phallus of the horse was especially holy. There is a story of one family whichpreserved this organ with onions and herbs, keeping it wrapped with a linen cloth in a chest and bringingit forth every evening to pass it around the people in the house. It was affectionately called Volsi, andeach person who held it spoke a verse ending with the refrain \"May Mornir receive this sacrifice.\"15Mornir is thought to be the name of a giant-woman, comparable to Gerdhr or Skadhi; arguments to thecontrary seem rather forced.The horse's head is put up on or carved on a stake to make anidhing-pole(pole of insult), which isused for curses and political criticism. Horses' heads are carved on the gables of the roof in Lower Saxonyor buried in a barn for the sake of warding.16In its oldest form, the horse is a solar animal. Its mane seems like the rays of the sun, and it is thebeast which draws the wain of the sun across the sky (see raidho).As the horse of Odhinn, it is the bearer of the dead, and misshapen horses or grays were often153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"thought to be omens of death and disaster. The horse is also the vehicle of travel between the worlds: Itmay be that the stick of thegandreidwas sometimes a sort of hobbyhorse, and a number of folk taleshave survived in which a witch turns a stick or reed into a horse and rides it to \"meet with the deviL\" theChristian term for the myrkreid (dark-ride) or kveldreid (night- ride) of the seidhr-worker.The use of the horse in divination and as the vehicle of godly wisdom is discussed under ehwaz.RAVENThe raven is the bird most associated with Odhinn. It is the bird of battle, and for one to be followed byravens on the way to war is a good sign, because it means that one will feed them well. Ravens flyingoverhead or croaking is a sign that Odhinn has heard one's prayers or accepted one's sacrifice and willhelp one. The raven was often embroidered on magical banners-an Anglo-Saxon account says that theNorse flag was of plain white silk, but a raven appeared on it in wartime. When the army was to win theday, its beak was open and wings fluttering, but when they were to lose, it sat still and its feathersdrooped. The Jarl Sigurdhr of the Orkney Islands had a raven banner which his mother had made. Thisbanner was so enchanted that whoever it was borne before would win the battle, but the standard-bearerwas doomed to die. Sigurdhr won many fights with its aid, but at the Battle of Clontarf (1016), after twomen had been killed under the banner, he was forced to take it up himself and so lost his own life and thebattle.The raven is a bird of cunning, wisdom, and trickery as well as of war. Odhinn's ravens Huginn andMuninn have been spoken of often-they are the bearers of Odhinn's mind, who often fly before his chosento show them their way. The deceptive nature of the raven appears often in later Germanic folklore, andGrimm says that the raven seems to combine within himself the folklorish characteristics of wolf and offox, melding the greed of one with the other's cunning.WOLFThe nature of the wolf has been somewhat discussed under the chapter on the vargr. The wolf is the fylgjaof a ferocious person, usually a warrior or a witch. Witches ride on the backs of their wolffylgjur, usingserpents for reins.The wolf is the embodiment of fury and chaos, which is seen in all its forms in Odhinn. As a being ofwoe, the nature of the wolf is shown in the Fenris-Wolf, the epitome of brute wildness. Coupled with this,however, one should consider the fact that it was lucky to meet a wolf when setting out on anyundertaking, just as it was lucky to meet a warrior. The wildness of the wolf is also its great strength.WYRM (first printed as The Northern Dragon, Northways 1, 1)The wordwyrmis the original Germanic-based term for a serpent or dragon,dracabeing adopted fromthe Latin draco at a very early time.When the dragon appears in Teutonic legend, it is nearly always as a frightful menace which mustbe slain by the hero. Sigurdhr's victory over Fafnir is his deed of daring \"which soar(s) highest theheavens beneath.\"18 In the case of Beowulf and Wiglaf, the dragon is the only fitting end for the agedBeowulf, who is clearly too great a hero for any man's sword to cut down, while Wiglafs role in the rightraises him to the position of Beowulf’s heir (the king lacking any heir of his own body). The hero israised up by his vktory over the dragon, but these are heroes who are already exceptional in some way.Beowulf has already proved himself mighty against the out-dwellers, and indeed has a few traits of theout- dweller himself (see Chapter 19, Grendel). Sigurdhr is the son of a shape changer, lineage whichgives him added strength in dealing with the dragon. The hero who holds this might, who stands at theborder of the gardhr, is the one who is closest to the great workings of Wyrd.The rewards which the wyrm holds for the hero who slays it also write its own nature forth. The first ofthese is, of course, the gold which is the embodiment of the dragon's vast magical might (see fehu; notethat the wyrm is said, when set upon a pile of gold, to grow to the exact size of the treasure), as is itspower of breathing fire or fiery venom. The hoard is concealed within a mound, which inBeowuifisunquestionably a burial mound. In the story of Fafflir, while no burial has taken place, the hoard is aninheritance, Sigurdhr's first plan being to win back that portion of Hreithmar's gold which Fafnir had keptfrom his brother Reginn. Not only is the power-hoard hidden, but it comes specifically from the \"past\"-the154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"concealed layers of that-which-is, which lie dark until a further turning awakens them. As Bauschatzpoints out the dragon only flies forth when disturbed by some deed which brings into the play the greatestturnings of Wyrd, coiling and layering in secret for years and coming forth at the point in becoming whenthe entirety of that- which-is is to be shifted.19 This can be seen in the figure of Nidhhoggr who lies at thevery roots of the World-Tree, hidden in the deepest layers of that-which-is, and who does not take flightuntil the end of Ragnarok when all is reshaped (the tie between the burial mound and the Well of Wyrdcan be seen in the rune perthro and its triad, kenaz-perthro-ingwaz).In bothBeowuifand the Sigurdhr story, a great deal of thought is given to the act of bringing thehoard forth from its place of hiding, which is to say, bringing the power forth from darkness so that theliving may make use of that inheritance which they have won from the deeper layers of that-which-is. Thecorpse of the Beowulf dragon is then tossed off a cliff and into the sea, showing its return to the hiddenlayers, even as Nidhhoggr must sink back after his moment of flight.20 It will be noted that the dragon ofTeutonic folklore is as often a creature of water as of earth; this is another means of showing theunderstanding of the dragon as the power dwelling beneath that which one can see. Water is, like thegrave mound, the holder of the gold/power of those who have lived before; it is, further, an even clearersign of the Well of Urdhr and its springing water which, through the layers of that-which-is, shapes that-which-is-becoming.The second reward which the dragon holds for the hero is the shaping of this inherited hoard inwisdom. Fafnir warns Sigurdhr of theweirdwhich he will win if he takes the dragon's gold and answersquestions about the workings of the worlds. By drinking Fafnir's blood and eating his heart, Sigurdhrgains the knowledge of things hidden, which is one of the greatest parts of the dragon's being. Only whenhe has claimed this inherited wisdom can he learn the secret of the sleeping Sigrdrifa (see Chapter 18,Valkryjur) and work the next great turning of his weird.As the embodiment of hidden might, the dragon is also present in the pathways of power which flowbeneath the skin of the earth. Lore showing this side of the dragon's being is particularly rich in Englandand other parts of Britain where the patterns of power have been marked with such care, but the Norsecertainly knew about this might and its use. The clearest showing-forth of the dragon or serpent as thegreat flow of earth-power is the Midgardhr's Wyrm which girdles the globe. Thorr's struggle with it inHymiskvidha shines forth as the shape of the tales in which a heavenly wight binds the earth-dragon to itstask of holding the world together either by pinning it down or by slaying it, As Thorr's power comesfrom the meeting of Odhinn's wind-might with the earth his mother, he is most well-matched with theWyrm. The dragon/serpent flow is a pathway for those who know how to use it; witness Odhinn's takingof snake-shape to enter Hnitborg and reach the Odhroerir-mead. These paths are, like the wyrms of thestory, a source of power and wisdom for the strong and a danger for the weak and unwary, holding theroots of the world together or gnawing at them in the same buried darkness.The chief open uses of the dragon were on weapons, as the prow of the longship, or in intertwinedornamentation; the coiled, rune-etched wyrm is a well-known sight to the learner of Teutonic lore. Thewyrm coiled on the hilt of the weapon to strengthen the wearer's hand, and ran up and down the blade sothat it would be mighty and deadly in battle, As the ship's prow, the dragon worked in several ways: itshowed the ship safely through the dark paths of the waters; it brought the force of the dragon's fierystrength and bravery into those warriors who used it as their battle-sign; and it aided in wreaking fear andwoe in those it was used against. It will be marked that the dragon's head had to be removed beforecoming into sight of land, and this was perhaps done in order not to frighten the landvaettir, but moreoverbecause the dragon in the open was the sign and agent of a great upheaval in the land-aweirdunwanted,when one hoped to return to a peaceful home. The use of the rune-carved wyrm on a memorial stoneshowed the power of the person remembered and of the deeds done which, though hidden in the layers oflives, would still work upon the worlds and be reachable to those who know how to draw forth mightfrom hiding. The wyrm further hints that secrets are held in the actual writings which only those whoknow can read and learn, thus shielding the mysteryand gaining the added might of concealment.The wyrm has sides of being which make it sib to the workings of several gods. As the keeper ofsecret wisdom, it is a part of odhinn's mysteries-the god takes the form of a serpent and shares names withthe wyrms at the roots of the World-Tree. The use of the wyrm in runic writings has been spoken of, andthe understanding of the dragon-paths is needed by the vitki. The relationship between Thorr and the155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Midgardhr's Wyrm is well known: though foes, they are in a sense sib, Thorr's lighting (as sowilo) beingthe heavenly mirror of the earth's dragon might and the moment of greatest power being the meeting ofthe heavenly flow with that of the earth (thuriaz). However, most of the shapes of the dragon's being showit to be as much a Vanic wight as one of Aesic works. It is a dweller in the mound, the place of Vanicburial and the stead of a number of rites honoring Vanic beings. As the keeper of earth-hidden treasures,it can be said to ward Freyja's wealth, just as the water dragon coils around the sunken riches of Njord.The foresight of the dragon seems nearer to the fore-sight and soul-deep knowing of the volva's seidhr-magic than to the rune-readings of galdr-power. The foresight of the Vanir is well known. Its concealmentbeneath earth or water makes the wyrm well fitted for a place among Vanic wights, as does its fierywealth. Like Freyja and Freyr, it strengthens the warrior-it holds the Vanic wisdom of the mound-deadfrom whom even Odhinn can learn and to whom he comes for knowledge of what should become. Theclaiming of the ancestral might which is shown so strongly in the dragon's being is also as much of theVanir as of the Aesir.156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"SECTION: IV APPENDICESRITESCIRCLE RITEPurpose: To set up a holy enclosure of warding and power for the performance of a rite.Earthly Tools: Gandr or sax; otherwise, as needed for following ritual.I.

If possible, one should stand with head and hands raised, facing east at sunrise, south atmidday, west at sunset, and north at midnight.(SUNRISE) Sing:“Hail to Sunna shining in risingHail the burning bringer of day.Dawn-breaking light is life of the earth.Whirls the sun-wheel ever onwardsHail to thee in the dawn!”(MIDDAY) Sing:162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"“Hail to Sunna shining in brightnessHail in holy heavens of dayMid-day light shining is life of the earth.Whirls the sun-wheel ever onwardsHail to thee in the day!”(SUNSET) Sing:“Hail to Sunna shining in settingHail in darkening death of the dayEvening’s red light blood and fire of life.Whirls the sun-wheel ever onwardsHail to thee in the evening!”(MIDNIGHT) Sing:“Hail to Sunna shining in darknessHail to thee in night’s blackest hourShroud of dark water and earth hides thy shining.Whirls the sun-wheel ever onwards,Hail to thee in the night!”RITE OF MIMIRTime: Ideally done at midnight, preferably done at night before going to sleep.I. Circle RiteII. Light the coal and sprinkle the recels on, chanting,“Flame-might from Muspellheim free in the fire Recels-smoke rising to hallow this hailWell it is wafting my will it shall wreak.”III. Light the candle and chant,“Candle, kindled Harrow’s holy fireThrough World-Tree’s darkness To Well show the way.Well do I ken Where Ygg’s eye is hiddenIn the wondrous Well of MimirWhere the Nine Worlds’ Wisdom is writtenFrom Midgardhr I wend my way to the Well.”IV. Strike the edge of the cup or horn with the gandr or sax and vibrate: “Asgardhr!” Wait until thelast resonance has died down and repeat the action, vibrating, “Hel! Midgardhr! Alfheii’n! Svartalfheim!163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Muspellheim! Vanheim! Niflheim! Jotunheim!” Pause for a moment of absolute silence, then strike thecup again, crying, “Mimir!”V. Staring into the waters of the cup or horn, chant so that your breath stirs the surface of the water“Hail, Mimir, wisest of the etin-kind,Hail to thee, Bolthorn’s famous son,Hail, warder of wisdom’s dark well.I have come to thee in the hidden hourBeneath the root of Ygg’s rune-ridden treeWhere Odhinn bought his draught with an eye.Mimir, warder of memory’s mightMy ancestors’ draught I come to drain,The waters of wisdom I come to drink.”VI. Meditate on the cup or horn until you can see that its rim is the rim of a stone well, with a greatevergreen rising from it, its roots concealed in the well’s depths. As you slowly drain the contents of thecup in one draught, see the world of what is around you: all that has gone to makeup that-which-is aliveand stretching outward into becoming, as the needles of the tree stretch outward, nourished by the waterflowing up from the hidden roots and through all the layers of wood to shape them.VII. Chant:“Mimir I thank, with hallowed draught homeward Fare I, all filled with memory’s might.”VIII. Draw the energy of the circle in or return it to the universe; if you used a physical circle, eraseor counter-trace it before stepping out.

Generally it is best to find the tree when onehas plenty of time and can concentrate on one’s magical sense of which tree is right, rather than feelinghurried by the movement of the sun. Also, trees process knowledge more slowly than humans, so it iskinder to give your wooded brothers and sisters a little time to prepare for being cut, as well as workingthe first might you put into the tree more thoroughly into the wood. This is not, however, absolutelyneedful.I. Go silently out to a wooded place and sit down on the ground, facing north with your palms on theearth. Breathe deeply and regularly, concentrating on the earth beneath you: fruitful mother, keeper ofseeds, womb and tomb of all that lives. Do this until you feel her might thrumming through your handsand body, until you feel that you are touching the deep, hidden, and silent wisdom of Mother Nerthus.Whisper softly,“Hail, holy earth who givest to all,All sib, who spring Sons and daughters, from thee.”164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Tell her your goal, singing the names of each of the runes softly, and ask for her help. Wait until youfeel some sort of answer. It may be as clear as a voice in your mind; it may be a soft inner tugging orurging in this direction or that, or any of a number of other things.II. Follow your sense of where to go until you reach a tree past which you feel you should not walkany further. Sit before it, facing north. With your palms on its trunk, breathe deeply and clear your minduntil you feel that you are touching the indwelling wight. Sing,“Hail to thee, tree-sib! A gift for a giftGive I at need that this work be wrought.”Whisper your purpose and need to the tree, singing the runes into it.Hail, warder of wisdom’s dark well.I have come to thee in the hidden hourBeneath the root of Ygg’s rune-ridden treeWhere Odhinn bought his draught with an eye.Mimir, warder of memory’s mightMy ancestors’ draught I come to drain,The waters of wisdom I come to drink.”VI. Meditate on the cup or horn until you can see that its rim is the rim of a stone well, with a greatevergreen rising from it, its roots concealed in the well’s depths. As you slowly drain the contents of thecup in one draught, see the world of what is around you: all that has gone to make up that-which-is aliveand stretching outward into becoming, as the needles of the tree stretch outward, nourished by the waterflowing up from the hidden roots and through all the layers of wood to shape them.VII. Chant:“Mimir I thank, with hallowed draught homewardFare I, all filled with memory’s might.”VIII. Draw the energy of the circle in or return it to the universe; if you used a physical circle, eraseor counter-trace it before stepping out. Extinguish the candle with a brief galdr such as “Candle-flamekindled now curl back to hiding,” and the coals with, perhaps, “Fire-might back to Muspellheim fare.”III. Pour the mead or ale into your hallowed vessel and make the sign of the Hammer or widdershinsswastika over it and the bread. Say,“Hallowed the holy drink I give,Hallowed be this breadWeal it work with glad heart givenGiven, a gift for a gift.”Set the bread down and pour the drink out at the tree’s roots.IV. Find the branch that seems best-fitted for your use. If possible, this should be one whose pruningwill only help the growth of the tree. Trace the runes you wish to use over it with your gandr, singingtheir names and a galdr telling the goal of your working. If you are doing this rite in two parts, tell the treewhen you are going to return to cut it, continuing with step Vat sunrise or sunset. Do not speak to anyonewhile leaving or coming back.165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"V. Meditate on the might of Nerthus flowing up through the tree and on the power of the tree itselfflowing into your branch, shaped by the shining runes you sang. Aware of this power, you are also awareof the pain you are about to cause to your tree-brother or -sister. Put that energy into tree and branch aswell. If a tear falls, touch it to the place where you are about to cut.VI. Cut the branch with one swift stroke if possible (this is why a hallowed axe may be needed),crying out sharply as a bright burst of might runs from your center down your weapon and into the tree,cutting through its limb. The wood should not be allowed to touch the ground, if possible. Hold it in bothhands, concentrating on sealing the bright life-force it still holds inside a shining sphere, then wrap it inblack cloth and put it away. Touch the tree where you have cut it, pouring some of your own strength intoit to help it heal. It is thought right by many to put a drop of your own blood on the wound in the tree.VII. Say a short blessing of thanks to the tree, then put your hands on the earth again and thankNerthus for her gift. Return home in utter silence.RITE OF WHEELSPurpose: To enliven the magical wheels of the body through runic meditation.The term “wheels of the body” is used in Teutonic magic for the whirling points of power along the spinewhich the Hindus call “chakras” and the Celts “cauldrons.” These wheels are gateways bringing mightfrom the various forms of the soul into the earthly body and from the hidden worlds of power into thesoul. Normally they are small and dim, moving sluggishly. For proper magical functioning, it is importantto open and enliven each of them in turn, awakening the specific quality of power which dwells in everylevel of your being. This awakening will make both magical and psychic functioning easier, since inaddition to allowing a greater passage of power through you it also increases your perceptions and aids inawakening your own hidden abilities. This exercise has been designed to strengthen and enliven thewheels of power from crown to feet and back again through the use of specific runes and colors.Lie down or sit with back straight, knees and feet together, palms on thighs, eyes closed. Begin deepmeditative breathing until you are completely relaxed and feel yourself in a state verging on trance.Slowly begin to vibrate the sound of sowilo, “sssss,” seeing and feeling this rune whirling in wheels ofwhite radiance at your crown, brow, throat, heart, solar plexus, groin/base of your spine, and feet. Whenyou feel this strongly, throw your force up to the crown of your head, vibrating the rune elhaz and seeinga sphere of rainbow-sparkling white spinning there with a brilliant red elhaz at its hub. Do this until youcan feel the crown of your head tingling with its radiant might. Breathe inward, seeing a white raystretching downward to the center of your forehead. Vibrate the rune mannaz, seeing a deep violet sphereof glowing light whirling in the center of your forehead around a burning red mannaz while the wheelabove your crown spins with none of its rainbowed-white light lost. Again, do this until you can feel theforce of the wheel as a bodily sensation in the center of your brow. Breathe inward, sending a purple raydown to your throat. Vibrate the rune ansuz . The color of this wheel should be deep, shining blue, therune, as all of the runes will be, red. Continue as before, sending a blue ray down to your heart, singingthe rune wunjo and enlivening this sphere with gold. The wheel in your solar plexus should be a richorange-red; vibrate jera. The wheel at your groin should be a deep, deep green-blue with a glowing center of red-gold at thebase of your spine; vibrate laguz. At your feet, the wheel should be a shade of brown-green so dark it isalmost black; vibrate berkano. Now aware of all the wheels spinning through your body, see the light theyare giving off blend into a sphere of might around your body which glows darkly in the bottom third,bright red in the middle, and shades to shining gold at the top. This sphere is both might and shieldaround you.When you have become good at doing this, perform the rite as above. After vibrating berkano,166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"breathe several times deeply while concentrating on all the wheels spinning together. Then vibrate therune sowilo, feeling an added power whirling into the lowest wheel. Sing eihwaz as you bring the mightup from your root to the wheel at your groin in a brilliant stream of red-gold might, then sowilo as youstrengthen that wheel. Repeat the eihwaz-sowilo process, letting the red-gold power flow up your spineand into each of the wheels to the top. Concentrate on the wheel at the crown of your head for a littlewhile longer, then bring the might down to your roots again in the same manner. Stand with legs spreadand arms and head upraised, vibrating, “Asgardhr-Midhgardhr-Hel!” Hold this peak for a few moments,then allow the fiery power to sink into darkness in your spine again. See the power of the wheels spinningout the dark-red-gold sphere of might and warding around you as at the previous completion.167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"GlossaryAesir (eh-sir): Gods of air, war, and spiritual consciousness.

The Saga of the Volsungs. East Brunswick, NJ:Associated University Press, 1982. A good book which includes not only translations, but comments on thehistorical origins and backgrounds of the various versions of the Volsung Saga.Baring-Gould, Sabine. The Book of Werewolves. New York, NY:Causeway Books, 1973. Contains a vast amount of fascinating information presented in a well-organized andrelatively unbiased fashion.Bauschatz, Paul.The Well And The Tree.Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1982.Thebook to readfor anyone who wants to understand the nature of Wyrd; no one attempting serious rumc divination should bewithout it. It can still be ordered.Baynes, H. G. Germany Possessed. London: Jonathan Cape Ltd., 1941. This book is marred from the heathenviewpoint by its rabidly Christian orientation. It was written by an Englishman during WWII, so its biases areonly to be expected. Nevertheless it provides a fascinating study of the breakthrough of the dark side of theOdhinnic archetype.Bessason, Haraldur/Glendinning, R.J.(eds.). Edda. Canada: University of Manitoba Press, 1983. A collection ofshort but very good essays.Beyerl, Paul. The Master Book of Herbalism. Custer, Washington:Phoenix Publishing Co., 1984. A Wiccan or quasi-Wiccan work. His folklore and medical attributions are almostall found in Grieve. Although some of his modern magical uses are interesting and effective, a great deal of thework (particularly the attribution of various herbs to various gods) seems to be largely a product of hisimagination. Warning: Beyerl does not identify poisonous or dangerous herbs as such, though he describes someof their uses. This book should not be used without external references of greater reliability and responsibility.Bord, Janet & Cohn.The Secret Country.London: Paladin, (c) 1978, 1985. An interesting study of the folklore ofthe British landscape.Branston, Brian.Gods of the North.New York: Thames & Hudson, Inc., (c) 1975, 1980. Branston ranges frombrilliant to eccentric in this book, which should not be used as a single source for anything, but often providesstartling insights or alternate perspectives on general problems in Germanic studies (such as the nature andidentity of Heimdallr). Lost Gods of England.London: Thames & Hudson Ltd., 1957, 1974. Generally more reliable than Gods of theNorth, although his comparisons of the Norse myths to Mediterranean cults in the latter parts of the book do notseem to me particularly well-founded.Chisholm, James (tr. and commentary).Poetic Edda.(c) 1989. An excellent literal translation which is exceedinglyvaluable to the study of Teutonic magic. This version was created specifically to aid magical and deep religiousunderstanding among those who are not able to use the Old Norse original and is the only one recommended forpurely magical use. Cooper, Jason D.Using the Runes.Wellingborough, Northampton-shire: the Aquarian Press, 1986. Not a terriblyimpressive book, although Cooper does offer some interesting thoughts on the relative developments of the cults ofTyr and Odhinn. Crossley-Holland, Kevin.The Norse Myths.New York: Pantheon Books, 1980. A very good introduction to Norsemythology. The Eddic stories have been competently rewritten here to appeal to the modern mind without maulingthe stories themselves or their meanings.

New York:Bell Publishing Co., 1981. An excellent work and most highly recommended, as are all of Ms. Davidson’s writings. Her books are particularlyinformative concerning the mysteries of the Vanic cults.Pagan Scandinavia.London: Thames & Hudson, 1987. This book deals more with pre-Viking Age customs andartifacts. Dumezil, Georges.Gods of the Ancient Northmen.Berkeley/Los Angeles/London: University of California Press,1973. A highly speculative work, dealing with Indo-European roots and comparisons of European myths to the RigVeda. Scholarly Teutonic heathens tend to become either Dumezihians who go about talking about the tripartitefunctions of society (king/judge/priest, warrior, and provider) or anti-Dumezihians who froth at the mouth when thisstuff is mentioned, claiming that these divisions could not be supported in any Teutonic society. I do not think muchof Dumezil myself, but his work has been very influential. The serious student of Teutonic subjects should read itfor him/ herself and draw her/his own conclusions. The very influential Edred Thorsson is a strong Dumezilian.Eliade, Mircea; W. R. Trask (tr.).Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.Bohlingen Series 46.

A good book on scholarlyrunology.Glob, P. V.; Rupert Bruce-Mitford (tr.). The Bog People. Ithaca, NY:Cornell University Press, 1969. A nice book on, as it says, the bog people (early sacrifices, possibly to Nerthus,preserved by the acids of the peat bogs in which they were buried).

A brilliant article I think, but then I also wrote it.Gumdas.Gemm Elixirs and Vibrational Healing.Boulder, CO: Cassandra Press, 1985. Good information on theproperties of stones and different ways to use them. As well as the channeled information, there is a great deal oflegitimate folklore concerning gems in this book.Hastrup, Kirsten. Culture and History in Medieval Iceland. Oxford:Clarendon Press, 1985. An excellent work which thoroughly details several major elements of Teutonic thought,particularly concerning innangardhs and utangardhs.179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Heaney, Seamus.North.London: Faber & Faber Ltd., 1975. Beautiful poetry, including a number of poems aboutthe bog people.Hollander, Lee (tr.).The Poetic Edda.Austin: University of Texas Press, (c) 1962, rep. in paperback 1986. Abeautiful poetic translation which is good for Teutonic liturgical use, especially when working with those whoare less deeply initiated into the frequently obscure mysteries of Northern poetic usages. Unfortunately,Hollander was often forced to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of meter and alliteratio~ do not try to use thisversion for detailed magical study, especially when working with kennings and other aspects of the languageused in these holy poems. What Hollander does offer is a stunning example of the use of Germanic English (asopposed to Latimzed) as it should be used in Teutonic rituals. Saga of the Jomsvikings.

A fascinatingbook by the father of modern runology and creator (discoverer?) of the Armanen futhark. Although sometimesvon List ranges into the romantic, airy, or downright bizarre, his intense depth of understanding and brilliance ofapproach make this an important book to any student of runic magic.MacCullough, John. Mythology of All Races, vol. 2:Eddic.New York, NY: Cooper Square Publishers, Inc., (c)1930, 1958, 1964. One of the best books available on Teutonic religion as viewed from an Eddic standpoint,although MacCullough also works quite a bit with folklore. Highly recommended.Magnusson, Eirikr/Morris, William (trs.).

This book deals solely with the Anglo—Saxon futhark; a number of their interpretations of the Rune Poemare very good. The attempts to set the runes on the Qabalistic Tree of Life are wholly ludicrous, but theirgenerally experimental attitude seems a very good thing, and they do offer some valuable alternate perspectives.Page, R.

An excellentreference work.Tyson, Donald. Rune Magic. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications, 1988. Tyson is primarily a ceremonialmagician, best known as the author of The New Magus. Rune Magic shows a great deal of research andthought. It also is written from the perspective of someone who is at best a little dubious about heathen deitiesand at worst sees them as unpredictable and dangerous beings which must be controlled by a transcendental“All-Father.” Many of his practices, such as the use of the pentagram in ritual, are taken directly fromceremonial magic and have little place in Teutonic workings. However, Tyson is a very good practicalmagician; some of his suggestions in that department and some of his insights into the runes make this bookworth the trouble, though it is recommended to check his interpretations against those of other writers.181"}]
