Copyright Mark Stavish 1997.11 March 1997ForewordThe following exercises are designed to assist in freeing the most potent energy known to humanity andresident in creation. They are not designed for someone with little or no esoteric experience. In general,it would be advisable to have at lest one to two years of practical, daily experience with the Middle Pillarand/or Pentagram Rituals; in addition, an equal amount of time with the Hexagram Rituals. Severalworking of the 32nd through 24th Paths on the Tree of Life would also be desirable[1], and regularpractice of once a week or so of “Rising on the Planes”[2]. Common sense, a willingness to “Make hasteslowly”, and a balanced lifestyle may be the best protection against any unpleasant side effects of these,or other, esoteric practices[3]. It is very important that you keep a diary of your practices andexperiences with the exercises given.The amount of time it will take to experience the Secret Fire is unknown, although preparation is thebest guarantee of success. The amount of time given to each exercise should not exceed more than 15 or20 minutes in the beginning, and then 30 or 45 minutes after the first half year or so. It is also stronglyadvised that anyone undertaking these exercises also maintain a regular, daily usage of spagyrictinctures for each of the planetary qualities of the day it is used. This additional, slow, and methodicalcleansing of the subtle psychic channels will aid in relieving some of side-effects of esoteric work. Thenightly application of “Dream Yoga” is also suggested, as this will attune the student to the qualities ofthe day while sleeping, aid in interior contacts, and may shed light on particular problems of theWork.[4]While this may seem like a lot of work, it is not. Tinctures are fairly easy to make, all that is required istheir regular use. This takes no more time than swallowing a vitamin. Dream yoga is done as we arefalling asleep anyhow, no additional time required for this either. What is does take is regularity,commitment, and perseverance. Qualities that assure, albeit confer, adepthood. Best of luck in yourpractices. In the Bonds of Esotericism,Ora et labora,Mark StavishWilkes-Barre, PennsylvaniaApril 1997IntroductionIn the Western esoteric practices there is an apparent knowledge gap regarding the role of esotericpractices and their effects on the subtle, and not so subtle, bodies of practitioners. In the East, allpractices, whether designated as such or not, are designed to awaken the semi-dormant energy residentin all creation, and ‘living beings’ in particular. This energy is known as “Kundalini”, “The Serpent Fire”,and the “Dragon” depending on tradition. Extreme care has been taken, despite contradictions betweensystems, to chart the effects of exercises on this latent energy, and how it ‘flows’ through the physical,emotional, and psychic body, at what stages, and in relation to which exercises. Such a detailed analysisis lacking in modern Western estotericism.For modern kabbalists, the most common introduction to ceremonial magic is through the Lesser Ritualof the Pentagram and the Middle Pillar Exercise. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to show how this,and related exercise can stimulate the Secret Fire, and to suggest exercises for its regulation by esotericstudents who are engaged in a Hermetic path, such as general studies or alchemy, who may haveexperienced its awakening and are in need of simple and direct exercises for its regulation.Theoretical BackgroundThe majority of modern esoteric students are familiar with the Middle Pillar exercise, as such, it will bethe fundamental basis for much of this article. In addition, the Sepher Yetzirah, and a limited number ofalchemical references will be made."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html2 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMThe basis of kabbalah is that through increasing levels of density, humanity came into its present state ofphysical incarnation and psychic evolution. Through rituals, exercises, and meditations, the energylatent in creation generally, and the body of the practitioner in particular, can be “awakened”, purified,and directed. This energy can then be used for spiritual development, psychic expansion, or physicalhealth and improvement.Creation - “In the Beginning ...”Creation is seen to have taken place, in Western kabbalistic and alchemical terms, in the followingprocess.The Divine mind of God, the Absolute, or in Hebrew the Ain Soph Aur (Limitless Light), through a seriesof expansions and contractions establishes the boundaries of Creation. The first world is the most subtle,and closest to the original state of non-existence, and is Atzilooth. This is called the world of Fire, because of the lively, undefined, and almost uncontrollable nature of fire. Next is Briah, or the World ofArchetypes and forms as our human mind can grasp them. It is symbolized as the World of Air, and isthe result as a barrier world that is formed by the creation of the next World, Yetzirah, or Water. This is the highly psychic and emotionally charged world immediately behind the veil of material existence, orAssiah. Also known as the World of Earth, because of the solid, concrete nature of material life.The purpose of this scheme, is to show that creation occurs in increasingly dense levels of energy-matter,from the most subtle, or Fire, to the most dense, or Earth. Within this context of increasing density,there also arises a series of ten planes or levels of consciousness which combines with energy-matter,known as Sepheroth, or spheres of being. They occur in a pattern of: unity, reflection, polarity,reflection, polarity, unity, reflection, polarity, unity, and finally materialization. This basic idea ofunity-polarity-and re-harmonizing, is the basis of kabbalistic and alchemical practices, and is derivedfrom the observation of Nature.Each World is a reflection to a denser or more subtle degree than the one before or after it. EachSepheroth is a reflection, in part, of what proceeds or follows it. However, since each reflection is onlypartial, or slightly distorted, each Sphere takes on its own unique characteristics. Only the so-called“Middle Four Sphereoth” have the ability to harmonize or reflect in total all of the energies of creation,on some level.This ‘zigzag’ of Creation is called the “Lightning Flash”. The return of energy from dense matter, backthrough the various stages, Sepherith, and Worlds of Creation is known as the “Path of the Serpent”because of its reverse, or complimentary ‘zigzag’ nature back up this diagram called the Tree of Life.For the alchemist, somewhere between the third and fourth level, or sphere of creation, energy takes onthe characteristic that will allow for the formation of matter at some future state, or level ten. Thisenergy is called Prima Materia, Chaos in the Bible, Spiritus Mundi (Spirit of the Earth), and others.Here, duality is made complete, and genuine polarity exists, as opposed to simple the potential, or idea,of polarity that had existed previously. Energy is divided into active and passive modes, with the activeenergy constituting the energies of life, and the passive one the energy of matter. In “The Golden Chainof Homer”, the active energy is called Niter and the passive energy is called Salt.The energy of Life manifests in two forms, Fire and Air. While both are predominately active in nature,fire is the more active of the two, with Air being slightly passive because of the partial Water Element inits makeup. Potential Matter manifests its energy as Water and Earth. These Elements have nothing todo with the material bodies of the same name, and as such are capitalized and called “Elemental” todistinguish them from the earth we walk on, water we drink, air we breath, and fire we cook with. Theyare in fact, energetic states, each with their own unique characteristics, as well as each of the previouslymentioned ten levels of consciousness within them. The Elements also have preferred ways ofinteracting with each other, to form the Three Principles of alchemy. There are in fact, forty differentways energy-matter-consciousness can manifest in our world.The Three Essentials are the alchemical principles of Sulpher, Mercury, and Salt. Like the “Elements”these principle concepts are to be thought of a “Philosophical” and not literally as chemical elements orcompounds. The Alchemical Sulphur, or Soul, of a things predominates in the animating principles ofenergy (Fire) and intelligence (Air); Alchemical Salt, or the physical body of a thing, predominates inunconscious forces, psychic, and instinctual intelligence (Water) and solid matter (Earth); AlchemicalMercury, or general life force, predominates in intelligence (Air) and instinctual forces, and psychicenergy (Water), as such it is the link, or bridge, between the higher forces of Sulphur and the lower bodyof matter.In the mineral realm the dominant energy is that of Earth, a little Water, and very little Air or Fire. Inthe vegetable realm, the dominant energy is Water and Air, but little Fire and Earth. In the animalrealm, the dominant force element is Fire, then Air, but little Earth. These qualities need to beunderstood as they have been defined for the following information to be of any use to the practicing, oraspiring, Hermeticist. For example, using the above definitions, we can say that the plant realm has an"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html3 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMabundance of instinctual energy (Water) and intelligence, i.e. a specific function (Air), but little directenergy (Fire), as this is received passively from the sun; and little hard, physical, matter (Earth).In the East as in the West, the idea of principle Elements and Philosophic Principles are expressed inmore or less the same manner. This original undifferentiated energy from creation is often called inIndian philosophy, and modern occult, and New Age circles, as akasha, or Spirit. However, akasha, consists of two (2) aspects, one active as we have noted, Niter, and the other passive, Salt. The energiesof Niter are also referred to as the force of Kundalini, or spiritual forces. In alchemy, this is the SecretFire. To the Salt, belongs the force of Prana, or Vital Energy. The function of the Vital energy is to maintain physical life forms and existence. It is completelyinstinctual and unconscious and is heavily influenced by cosmic cycles, astrological pulses, and othernatural phenomena. The function of the Secret Fire is to increase in humanity, the only place where it ispresent, its sense of self, or “I”. At the lowest level or functioning, this is the ego, at its highest, it isDivinity incarnate, as both are two sides of the same coin. One is ‘self’ in relation to the physical worldand others; the other is ‘self’ in relationship to all of Creation and as a co-creator.In the vast majority of humanity, this Secret Fire, or liberating energy of self-consciousness, liesdormant, asleep at the base of the spine, coiled like a serpent. Only a small amount manages to escape,reaching a sepherothic level, or so-called chakra, thus creating a loci of consciousness for each person. If it reaches the top of the skull, and beyond, a spiritual awakening can occur, allowing for a descent andre-ascent of the energy, during which the psychic centers can be awakened allowing for themanifestation of psychic powers and related phenomena.The Secret Fire ascends as a result of a temporary weakening of the Vital Energy in the physical body.This is why so many spiritual awakenings take place under great physical stress, times of illness, ornear-death-experiences. When the Secret Fire will ascend through the various psychic-physical currentscausing it to be enveloped in a sphere of luminous light.The experiencing of the Secret Fire, as a result of the suppression of the physical body’s Vital Energy, cancreate condition which manifests in various forms:-Some perceive the bright light as an angel, their Higher Self, or “Holy Guardian Angel”, others as aspiritual teacher.-Astral projection may result, along with perception of the immediate surroundings.-Uncontrolled physical movements may also result, typical of so-called ‘kundalini phenomena’: shaking,rapid breathing, swinging of the torso, uncontrolled giddiness, and sitting straight upright in thePharonic position.After a period of time, the energy will descend, and return to the base of the spine.The effects of this awakening will take some time for the consciousness of the individual to adjust to, andnot limited to the ‘non-physical’ realms. The physical body, although to a lesser degree, is also changedand improved in functioning, constituting a genuine “re-birth’ on several levels. However, it is up to themind, or sense of “I”, of the individual, to cooperate with this influx of power if more permanent changesin consciousness are to be made.As we can see, the concept of kundalini, or the Secret Fire, is linked to two polar concepts: that of theundifferentiated creative energy, and the second, as the seed of this energy locked on each cell ofmaterial creation, and focused in humanity at the base of the spine.When this energy rises as a result of psychic experiences, and not because the physical weakness, cancause the Vital Energy of the body to be concentrated on various areas of the body, creating physical andpsychic disturbances. If the energy becomes concentrated in the head, it can create the illusion of aspiritual awakening, as well as the well known “hot and cold” flashes, or currents, up and down thespine. The effects of the Secret Fire however, and not its re-distributive effects on the Vital Energy, cancreate the following phenomena:Intense pains suggestive of an illnessCrawling sensations of ants or small bugs over the skin, as well as a ‘jumping’ sensation of theenergyA feeling of crystal clear calmness and tranquillity, rise from center to center to the top of theheadAscending in the famous ‘zigzag’ or Rising Serpent patternThe energy can skip a center or twoThe energy can reach the top of the head in a flash of lightThe character attributes of both positive and negative are exaggerated and sexual power isincreased."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html4 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMIf the energy rises to the top of the head, then it becomes possible to work directly on the Vital Energywithin the body, and use it, as a means of enhancing the psychic experience and spiritual awakening.In short, the psychic centers must first be awakened by the Secret Fire and purified, before the energy ofthe physical body, can be concentrated upon them. Thus, our psychic exercises, and esoteric meditations are designed to prepare our minds, bodies, andconsciousness for the liberation of the Secret Fire buried deep inside us. Through a progressive cleansingof the blood, nervous system, and endocrine glands, the ‘chains’ of the Vital Energy upon the Secret Fireare reduced and eliminated, allowing the ever present power and energy, a veritable pressure waiting tobe released, to spring into action. Thus, the Serpent doesn’t really sleep, it is we who are asleep to itspresence and potential blessing.The Secret Fire and the Sepheroth“So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flamingsword which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life.” Genesis 3:24The use of the “Tree of Life” has been both a blessing and a curse for modern esotericism. Whenunderstood, the “Tree” offers a complete and working model of Creation on both the microcosmic andmacrocosmic scales. However, where many fail is on the personal level. The ability to apply the oftenvery general information of the Tree to personal experiences of the initiate when they deal withphysiological phenomena is profoundly lacking in modern esoteric circles. The reasons for this areseveral: First, many modern esotericists simply repeat what they have learned without experiencingwhether or not it is true on a personal level; second, the language of kabbalah is multi-leveled, with thesame word having several meanings, thus many who are using the words don’t know what they actuallymean, or on what level it may be interpreted; thirdly, the diagram of the Tree is simply too neat andcompartmentalized. Many kabbalists are unable to adapt to the fact that interior reality is much moreflexible than the Tree allows when applied to the two dimensional page or illustration.These problems are farther complicated by the idea of “One Tree” but “Four Worlds” making muchmeaningful, practical information nearly impossible to come by regarding the crises of spiritualawakening and so-called Kundalini phenomena as it relates to kabbalistic practices. When compared tothe clear and explicit information available from Taoist and Tantrik sources, it is no wonder that somany Americans and Europeans prefer those systems to those more culturally and historically related.To help resolve these problems in the transmission of knowledge, only information that has arelationship to experience of the author or others he has discussed this topic with will be included here.Theory will be stated as theory, and experience as experience. The meaning of common kabbalisticwords will be defined, and redefined, to keep the communication clear and direct. An extensive use ofconfusing and somewhat irrelevant god-forms, references to mythology, and cosmology unconnected tothe personal experience will be avoided.Arousing the Sleeping Serpent“Just as Moses lifted up the flaming serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that allwho believe may have eternal life in him.” John 3:14-15The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram is often the first ritual learned by aspiring magicians. Its function isto teach the basic mechanics of solitary ritual, and to give a basic technique whereby destructive energiesmaybe repelled or dispersed from the sphere of influence of the operator. The symbols used in the ritualare fundamental to other rituals of a more complex nature, however, to disregard the Lesser Ritual assomehow less effective is a mistake. A ritual, no matter how simple or complex is only as effective as theskill of its operator. Repeated use of the LRP is can be more effective than incompetent or irregular useof more sophisticated rites.In total, there are approximately six fundamental rituals used in Western occultism reflecting aninfluence of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: 1) the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram 2) theSupreme Ritual of the Pentagram 3) the Lesser Ritual of the Hexegram 4) the Greater Ritual of theHexegram and 5) the Rose+Cross Ritual. The use of The Flashing Sword appears to be irregular, however it will also be considered along with its companion exercise or, The Rising Serpent.Within these, the use of the Middle Pillar is optional, it is however, the Middle Pillar Exercise which doesthe most to purify the bodily energies, or Vital Energy, and make pathways for the release of the SecretFire.The Middle Pillar“I will make the victor a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will writeupon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, whichcometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.” Revelations 3:12"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html5 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMSeveral variations of the Middle Pillar Exercise exist, however their fundamentals remain the same.Whether or not one uses the Elements as suggested by Regardie in “True Art of Healing” or theSepherothic/planetary correspondences as he later suggests (and is most commonly used) in his book“The Middle Pillar” is irrelevant. The methods used by the Arum Solis will also be considered as analternative exercise.The theoretical basis of the Middle Pillar is that through imagination, breath, and concentration, thepsychic energy of creation, here principally Yetzirah, can be directed allowing for a purification of theVital Energy that holds the Secret Fire in check. As our psychic centers are cleansed of emotional, moral,and materialistic residue, they better reflect the cosmic energy that works through them. Through itspre-described pattern of circulating the energy, the Middle Pillar assists in smoothing out the edges ofour aura, as well as increasing the flow of energy in general directions, so that the psychic pathways,both large and small, can be purified and strengthened through an increase of Vital Energy.The pathways described for the Middle Pillar are circular in nature. They are for the most part large,clear, and bright, with a reflective quality too them. Regardie says that the psychic spheres should beimagined like large, clear, brilliant diamonds if no other color is known. Although, in the end, the entiresphere, or extended aura, of the practitioner should be imagined as a brilliant diamond radiating heatand light.The beauty of the Middle Pillar is that it, like many esoteric practices, is really a layered exercise.Containing an almost infinite amount of flexibility and growth potential. As the practitioner develops inskill and manipulation of the imagery, the amount of new possibilities increases.One of central movements of the Middle Pillar is the “Fountain of Light”. Here, the practitionerimagines a brilliant force of energy forcing its way up through the soles of their feet and out the top oftheir head, spraying along the edges of their aura, making it strong and clear of any roughness, andgathering again at their feet. This cyclic imagery is repeated several times. This key part of the exercise,is the central part that prepares the central pathways for the eventual release of the Secret Fire. It is alsosimilar to Eastern practices as seen in Chinese Chi Kung, Indian Tantra, and Tibetan Vajrayana yoga.This being said, it is also clear that some differences exist between Eastern and Western methods ofreleasing the Secret Fire. The methods of direct work on the psychic centers, and an upward climbing ofthe spinal column is more traumatic than the more general work of the Middle Pillar. It is for thisreason, that the techniques of yoga, save a few, that are aimed straight away at releasing the Secret Fire,require supervision of a guru. Being that they so restrict the activities of the practitioner, and requireclose supervision, they are also systems that are impractical for day to day life in American andEuropean culture. While similarities exist, and will be examined, the major differences appear to be the following:1) Indian yoga is aimed principally at liberation from the physical realm in as quick a method aspossible. Western esoteric practices are aimed at the perfection of matter and the psyche within thematerial world, and not an abandonment of it.2) Chinese yoga, or Chi Kung, is more akin to Western practices, in that it is aimed at perfection of thematerial world, and even the spiritualizing of the body into a “Body of Light”. It however, is more akin toIndian yoga, in that it starts at level of the etheric body (nadis or acupuncture points) and proceeds fromthere. This “from the bottom up, and inside out” approach is different from the Middle Pillars “topdown, outside in” method. Because the etheric body is directly effected early on, the effects are moredramatic, as well as potentially traumatic for the unprepared. In the Middle Pillar, the etheric body isoften the last thing effected. This is because the symbolism used, as well as the need to develop skills inconcentration, visualization, and meditation effect primarily the mental outlook of the practitioner for along period of time. Only after considerable practice, of a year or more, on a daily basis, do the effects ofthe Middle Pillar begin to sink into the astral body, and eventually filter into the etheric and physicalbodies of the practitioner. It is stated in one source, that it takes a minimum of three years for even themost advanced yoga practitioner to release the Kundalini through special exercises. A ‘release’ which wehave stated, is not a release per say, but the removal of obstacles to its natural expression. This is acritical point, since it is often said that to experience kundalini will often take twenty years of practice ofesoteric exercises, or even Hatha Yoga, the same amount of time it took Nicholas Flamel to confect ThePhilosopher’s Stone. During a recent workshop, Jean Dubuis stated that it may be possible to completethe extremely dangerous Flamel Method in three years. It may be that for the alchemist, the interiorcreation of the Philosopher’s Stone is nothing short of the kundalini experience, and the exteriorcreation of the Stone is the ability to direct this Cosmic creative energy at will.3) Tibetan systems run somewhere between the Chinese and Indian, in that they are concerned withliberation, but also with the creation of an etherial body made from their bodily essences. This Diamond Body, or Rainbow Body, is pure light and can materialize at the will of the adept. Like the Chinese andIndian systems, the Tibetan use a rituals for the purification of the mind and emotions of thepractitioners, as well as the visual images in both anthropomorphic deities and abstract geometric"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html6 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMforms. The Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram fulfill this function when performing the MiddlePillar.Thus, we can see, the major differences in Eastern and Western practices can be summarized in functionand reference point of origin. The East seeks liberation through progressive untying of the knots ofignorance that bind humanity to incarnation. The West seeks to perfect the material world makingmaterial reality a reflection of spiritual reality. One accomplished, the adept can then proceed todis-incarnate at will. The Western approach seeks to be more active in the world and to transform it,while the Eastern approach is to see the world as an illusion that is impermanent, and as such, is morepassive. Such philosophies, like all beliefs and cultures, reflect the physical environment of their earliestorigin. In tropical and sub-tropical zones the concern with time is less important that in the Northernhemisphere where a winter without food stores means death for the community. The cold, harshrealities of arctic zones produce a different theory and technique, and as such, different ideal (gods) thanagricultural areas. Whether one is a hunter nomad or an established agrarian society is reflective of thephysical landscape they live in, and as such effects values, needs, and spiritual philosophy andtechnique.This is of critical concern whenever one is considering adopting the esoteric practices on another land orculture. Why did it arise, and under what circumstances? Are those same conditions applicable today,and in the life of the potential practitioner? In view of current conditions, are the practices beingconsidered progressive or regressive in nature? That is, are they forward moving, or simply anidealization of a mythical past ‘golden age’?Salt, Saturn, Sexual Ecstasy, and Spiritual Bliss “The heart girt with a serpent is my Name!” Chaldean OraclesSalt is a symbol of wisdom and learning. Saturn, is associated with Ouroboros, the Great Serpent bitingits tail, symbolic of limitation. As such it is closely allied with the earth, but also all of material creation,and those things which border on non-being, or Eternity. In one 15th century manuscript, the serpent is made of two colors, red and green. Red is outside and green is inside. Green, the color of Nature and ofVenus, is the beginning of the Work. Red, the color of the Stone, and Mars, is the end of the Work.“Sapiens dominabitur astris.” The wise shall exercise dominion over the stars. As we correct theastrological imbalances (i.e psychic centers or chakras) within ourselves, astrological conditions outsidehave less of a negative effect on us. We gain dominion over the ‘stellar’ forces and can “make the sunshine in our oratory when we will it so.”The seventeenth century pupil of Jakob Boehme, Gichtel placed the cosmic spiral, or “Wheel of Nature”within the human body. J.G. Gichtel’s Theosophica Practica, 1898. Saturn is the crown, Jupiter the brow, Mars the throat, Sun with a serpent around it, the heart, Venus liver, Mercury the spleen, andMoon the sexual organs, or in straight theosophic decent down the Tree. It is the Heart with a serpentthat attracts our attention. Here he also places the Element of Fire.Egyptian initiates were also called scarabs because they pushed along the egg of their regeneration.Mysteria Magica, vol 3 The Magical Philosophy: The brow included in the Middle Pillar (called: ClavisRei [1st Formula] The Rousing of the Citadels) and the color scale varies with each center. An additionaluse of the rising twin serpents of the Caduceus are included at the end. The brow is attributed to Saturn,and is said to balance out the Yesod center, as well as add power to the remaining centers in the MiddlePillar as the Golden Dawn and Aurem Solis present it.Alchemically, Salt is derived from the union of Elemental Earth and Elemental Water (or Assiah andYetzirah), the Secret Fire is ‘hidden’ in the Salt (material body) and represents the unconscious,instinctual forces that seek release. It is sometimes called “Hellfire” in that if uncontrolled, or poorlyreleased, it can reek havoc on the body and psyche of the student, via its purifying effects. This isillustrated by the 31st Path, or Path of Fire, sometimes mistaken for “Purgatory” or “Hell” by the un-regenerated who pass through this Path after death. This Path is also under the direction of Mercury andShin, the symbols of spiritual guidance and evolution. For those interested in Notarikon, Shin shares thesame numerical value, 300, as the Hebrew phrase, “The Spirit of the Living God.”“I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I,whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”Matthew 3:11The letter Shin is often used in meditation as a symbol of Divine light, life, love, or presence. It isimagined above the head, just touching the crown, then inside the head proper (as it is associated withintelligence and the energy of the nervous system in the Sepher Yetzirah), descending into the heart, and finally, expanding from there to engulf the meditator in a sea of fire. Because it consists of three flamingYods, or tongues, it is sometimes associated with the flaming tongues of Pentecost, and a variety of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html7 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMTrinitarian concepts.Several possible interpretations are available to use regarding this statement: One suggests that Johnthe Baptist was initiating repentance as well as entrance into the watery world of Yetzirah, but thatJesus, was offering a path of initiation into the fire of the Soul, or full adepthood. A secondinterpretation is that John was offering initiation up the 29th Path, or the Path of Water; while Jesus wasoffering the harder and more rigorous Path of Fire, or the 31st Path to his disciples. Neither of these is adefinitive answer, only a modern kabbalistic attempt to understand Scripture in the context of initiaticpractices. The mention of the Holy Spirit is more informative however, as this phrase was adopted by theJews during the period of the Babylonian Captivity and represents the origin of Persian and Chaldeaninfluences on Jewish mystical beliefs.The term Holy Spirit (Ruach Elohim) is derived from the Zend Avesta, and the phrase, Spenta Mainyu,or “Holy (Creative) Spirit”. The creative power is implied and not stated in the original, an appears to belost in subsequent translations into modern languages via Jewish and Christian traditions. This SpentaMaiynu is a purifying and regenerating energy and intelligence with a cosmic host of six or sevenintelligence’s at its command.“It [Spenta Mainyu] is the self-realizing quality or activity of Ahura Mazda (the Good Mind); it is theself-generating energy that leads to the creation and evolution of the universe. Spenta Mainyu is dynamic and creation is an ongoing process. For Zoroaster, holiness meant also abundance, growth, andhealth. Spenta Mainyu represents the principle of augmentation and development in the universe.” (F.Mehr, p.29)This power and their beings comprise the Mathrem, or Mathra, literally, ‘the sacred word of power’,which is the basis for the development of the practice of mantra in India and “Words of Power” in theMiddle East and Egypt. Manthrem or Mathra is in its own right held to be the supreme mantra fromwhich all others are derived, in the same fashion as YHVH is the origin of all Hebrew Divine Names.This is mentioned because in Persia and Babylon, the convergence of what would develop intosemi-independent Eastern and Western esoteric practices is complete. In one respect, it could be said tobe the original home of yoga, kabbalah, alchemy, and magic as we know them. Period art andarchitecture shows winged creatures familiar to Jewish and Egyptian tradition, planetary diagrams, anearly version of the Tree of Life, and several variations of the intertwined serpent motif.The Cosmic Triangle of Fire “The successful adept must be endowed with a knowledge of the material of the Great Work; also withfaith, silence, purity of heart, and prayerfulness. After passing through the gate surmounted with thehieroglyph of philosophic mercury he traverses the seven angles of the citadel, representing the chiefoperations of the Great Work - calcination, dissolution, purification, introduction into the sealed Vase ofHermes, transference of the Vase to the Athanor [furnace], coagulation, putrefaction, ceration,multiplication and projection. And even upon reaching the Petra Philosophalis, he finds it is held incustody by a formidable dragon.”Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae, Heinrich KhunrathSaturn is related to Mercury in alchemical text, and is given the same ambiguous sexuality, orandrogyny, and named it ‘Mercurius senex’.In Tiphareth, the geometric symbol is the interlaced triangles of water and fire, or the Star of David.When expanded to connect the planetary sepheroth of the Tree (with Saturn being attributed to Daath),the Triangle of Water connects the spheres of Mars, Jupiter, and Luna. The Triangle of Fire connectsSaturn, Venus, and Mercury.Just as Orobouros is cosmic energy (the serpent) limiting itself (Saturn), Venus is the creative cosmicforce multiplying itself in life (its vegetative nature) as a prism splits the light of the sun. Mercury, likeSaturn in many respects, is androgynous, and controls the fire of creation, directing it in the creation ofthe Philosopher’s Stone. Mercury holds the Caduceus, or winged staff with two serpents intertwinedaround it. The Wings represent sublimation, the serpents the basic forces of creation. There crossingover is the psychic centers, often given as seven in number, here representing the colors in the spectrum,plus white (Venus). Central to the diagram is Sol, which is the cosmic creative forces which unify,enliven, and harmonize creation, and which we can hope to contact. It is central, and directs andcontrols all of the other planets, psychic centers, or aspects of Cosmic energy.By contacting the fire of the Sun, we can open the fire of the other psychic centers (via Venus), and moreeasily direct the restrictive and enlightening energy of Saturn, through the powers of the Mind, orMercury.To understand these multi-faceted aspects of the planets, particularly Venus and Mercury, it isimportant to have done the Pathworkings up to Tiphareth. While this is not required to perform the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html8 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMtechniques later in this monograph, it is a help for an understanding of the theoretical part.However, we can begin to understand the relationship of the Spheres to each other by undertaking aseries of meditations based on the following idea:Venus is the regenerating, sensual, active life force in its vegetative and unconscious manner. It respondsto heat, light, and emotion. On the Path of the Decent, Venus splits the singular rays of the Sun into themany facets of the color spectrum, and as such, can lead us to a better understanding of the relationshipbetween multiplicity and unity, the psychic centers and planets, and their unique natures. On the Path ofAscent, Venus re-unites the divergent energies, both planetary and personal (psychic centers) andharmonizes it into a singular force, although still multi-colored, until it returns to the Sun as pure light.“This Stone rises in growing, greening things.” Wherefore when the Green is reduced to its formernature, whereby things sprout and come forth in due time, it must be decocted and putrefied in the wayof our secret art.” Splendor solis, TrismosinThe Stone is made through the greening of nature (Netzach) and it returning to its source (Tipahreth) byputrefaction (Death card of the path connecting them).Mercury gives form and meaning to the diverse energies made by the splitting actions of Venus, andre-unites them as fundamental forces, symbolized by the Caduceus. Mercury is Psychopomp, or Guide ofthe Soul, and directs the energies that Venus represents. Since both Venus and Mercury sit at the base ofthe Pillars of kabbalah, they access the material, astral, and mental realms, and can influence all three tosome degree. On the Descent, Mercury creates form and structure, for the body, the mind, or the soul,and on the ascent, Mercury helps free us from the limitations of form, without forgetting its lessons.The serpent is primordial force or energy, fire and water being the principle two of creation, with air andearth following them. Because it shed it’s skin, it is seen as a symbol of regeneration and renewal. It isalso dangerous, deadly, can be found often in ‘guardian’ roles near springs or water as well as deserts.When controlled or mastered, is seen as mastering a powerful and deadly, yet regenerating force, basicto creation, or possibly from which creation came.The Secret Fire is directly linked to the sexual, (i.e. principle and most basic creative forces) inhumanity. Here, the relationship between ‘bliss’ ‘ecstasy’ and the erotic impulse can be clearly seen andexperienced. The development of a host of ‘sexual yogas’ and ‘sex magic(k)’ practices bear this out tosome degree. However, it is the sexual desire in humanity that acts as its basic drive and evolutionaryforce. It is also suggests that the ability and need for mystical experiences is biologically rooted. Only beignoring the most basic of pleasures, sex, can we ignore the drive to ecstatic union on some level. The‘little death’ or petite morte, is a forerunner of the ‘big death’ as we let go and experience divine oblivion.Sexual power, linked to our innate drive for mystical experiences, is also linked to human evolution, andsome kind of predetermined point or state to which we are being directed.This is a significant point, in that almost all of modern Western societies psychological illnesses arefocused around sexual repression and obsession. If the Secret Fire flows freely, or with greater strength than before, without the proper purification of theVital Energy of the physical body, it is possible that it will result in what appears to be extreme physical,but more likely psychological illness in the form of schizophrenia and psychosis; instead of psychic gifts,genius, and either transpersonal states, or simply altered states of consciousness.Wilhelm Reich, the father of Orgon Therapy states that the basis for all mental-emotional disturbancesare anchored in the physical body, and that these anchors can be released through breathing techniques,somewhat similar to pranayamana. Since the body is the “Salt” of alchemy, and partially composed ofaccessible unconscious elements through its “Watery Element” all of our emotional and physicalexperiences become indelibly marked, associated, or stored in our physical body. If these blocks, orenergy concentrations of emotional and physical trauma (composed of Vital Energy) are not removedbefore the Secret Fire begins to flow more intensely, the so-called negative side effects of ‘Kundaliniphenomena’ will appear.Abuse of drugs, alcohol, and sexual extremes only worsen the condition in that they inadvertentlyrelease the Secret Fire by weakening the physical body and its link to the astral, thereby damaging theetheric substructure, and create energy blocks in the end rather than diminish them, when the mind andbody attempt to make repairs. A nervous system damaged by substance abuse makes a tricky vehicle for the clear, clean, and powerfulexpression of the Secret Fire. It is through our nervous system (under the domain of Yesod-Luna) thatwe engage both the physical world, as well as out interior world. It links the body (Malkooth) with theMind-Intellect (Hod) as well as instinctual, creative, and sensual urges (Netzach). If it is damaged, ourability to relate fully, creatively, and productively to these psyhco-physical-spiritual parts of our selfbecomes endangered. If it is damaged, then our most direct and important link to our Holy Guardian"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html9 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMAngel, and means of releasing the Secret Fire safely (via Tiphareth) is threatened in this incarnation.“Listen, then while I make known the Grand Arcanum of this wonder-working Stone, which at the sametime is not a stone, which exists in every man, and may be found in its own place at all times.... It iscalled a stone, not because it is like a stone, but only because by virtue of its fixed nature, it resists theaction of fire as successfully as any stone....If we say that its nature is spiritual, it would be no more thanthe truth; if we describe it as corporeal, the expression would be equally correct; for it is subtle,penetrative, glorified, spiritual gold. It is the noblest of all created things...it is a spirit or quintessence.”A Short Guide to the Celestial Ruby, Philethes.Freeing the DragonHow long it takes to un-block our psychic anatomy for a more complete and harmonious functioning ofthe Secret Fire is unclear. It is stated that even the most advanced yogis require a minimum of threeyears of special practice for this to occur. Since that kind of training takes place under specialized andsupervised conditions, it can be assumed that modern Western life requires more time, as well asself-reflection and referral, since the average Western occultist, be they kabbalist, alchemist, or both, willspend the majority of their time working alone or at best in occasional small groups.Certain schools of yoga as well as kabbalah and Sufi practices view the heart as the center of theindividual universe, and the most important of all psychic centers. By opening the heart, we gain accessto our Interior Master, or Holy Guardian Angel (messenger),characterized by a strong manifestation ofintuition. This is the final resting place for the Serpents Tongue after its ascent over the skull, and asBoehme and Hermetic imagery have shown, the “Heart girt with a serpent” is the ideal to which mysticsaspire.As one yogi put it, we approach the “Big King” first, and allow him to direct the activities of the serpent -language not unfamiliar to Hermeticists.Adam Kadmon: Secret Fire and YHVH“For our God is a consuming fire.” Hebrews 12:29While alchemy, kabbalah, and astrology have been homogenized in modern esoteric practices to createan almost seamless synthesis, this is not true of earlier periods. Traditionally, alchemy and astrologyplayed almost no role in Jewish kabbalah[5], and while it has been put forward that may Jews werealchemists, and some great alchemists possibly Jews[6], no manuscripts of Jewish alchemical practicesseem to exist in any great number. Even the most famed Esch M’saref, or “The Refiner’s Fire”, is acompilation of material, focusing mainly on gematria, and not a ‘chemical’ work in itself.Early kabbalists imagined creation taking place in several stages, from which was generated theanthropomorphic image of the ‘primordial man’, or Adam Kadmon. This ‘first man’ was imagined asbeing crated out of the four-letters of the Divine Name stacked one on top of the other. Yod was thehead, Heh, the arms and shoulders, Vau, the spine and sexual organs, and the final Heh, the hips andlegs. A host of attributes and qualities came to be associated with each letter, and as a whole, it formedits own school of kabbalistic meditation. By adding other letters, altering combinations, and substitutingletters based on numerological equivalents, additional Divine Names, names of archangels, angels, andother spiritual beings were generated.The oral tradition of Adam Kadmon is similar to that of the Egyptian god Osiris, in that Osiris wasdismembered and reconstructed, while Adam “Fell” to pieces, and it is the work of the kabbalist toreconstruct the Original Adam. Each of us is said to be a piece of this original soul, and it is our purposeto find our place in Creation, via kabbalistic methods.Saint-Germain and the Most Holy Three-Fold WisdomThe idea of Secret Fire in initiatic psycho-alchemical texts such as The Most Holy Trinsophia (Three Fold Wisdom)[7] illustrate the point of hidden fire, associated with volcanic power, and under theinfluence of Venus. Works such as this bear a strong resemblance to alchemical-kabbalistic texts, andeither use mystical symbolism of these esoteric schools, or such symbols are used to interpret the textsmeaning. In the text, Saint-Germian reportedly recounts the details of his initiation through the twelve degrees ofCosmic Consciousness. The use of earthly fire in the form of volcanic eruptions, lava, and seas of flamesymbolize the presence of an underlying matrix of living energy that pervades material and non-materialcreation, uniting and constantly renewing it through what can be seen as violent activity.La Tres Sainte Trinsophie is comprised of twelve sections, each with its own illustration. The mostobvious alignment that can be seen, is between the twelve sections, the zodiac, and the stages ofalchemy. It can also be suggested, for our considerations, the seven major and five minor psychic"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html10 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMcenters. The story begins with Saint-Germain on the lava beds of Vesuvius, later he passes an alter on which is acup, with a winger serpent intertwined around it twelve times. Saint-Germain then enters into a vastrealm of fire, in the midst of which is a greenish-gold serpent with ruby eyes which he must dominatewith a sword, the symbol of an enlightened will. With this act, anger, hate, and pride are cast out of hisconsciousness, and the senses are brought under direction.In one of the scenes depicted, Saint-Germain is in front of a triangular alter with an elaboratecandlestick . It’s base if formed out of two intertwined serpents and terminates at a lotus, with the taperplaced in the center. Two inscribed panels accompany the illustration. The first one reads: “To the strongis given the burden” and the second, “Kindle a fire upon the high place that the sacrifice may be borneupward to the Desired One.” The final illustration shows the heavens ablaze with light and a trianglesurrounded by a square and circle. The initiate, here Saint-Germain, is accompanied by Isis Revealed,the goddess of life and Nature.The pictures described illustrate that even at the end of the Illuminist era, classical alchemical andkabbalistic symbolism was in widespread use by esotericists. However, its direction was changed fromclassical, or laboratory alchemy, to ‘philosophic’ or ‘spiritual’ alchemy. Just as kabbalah had undergonea radical transformation at the hands of alchemists and Christian mystics, alchemy itself had alsochanged. While such manuscripts may be of dubious value for practical laboratory work, fortunately,they still are of value for interior spiritual initiation - an initiation that only the Secret Fire can bring.ExercisesThe Middle PillarThe Middle Pillar is a well known exercise to almost every student of magic. The details of the exerciseare clearly outlined in Israel Regardie’s book of same name, and will not be gone into here. Instead,exposition of those point relevant to the Secret Fire will be outlined. These points are:The establishment of Malkooth.1.Circulation of the Light2.The Fountain of Light3.Malkooth as Kether4.Relationship of Tiphareth to Malkooth and Kether5.Secondary considerations will be paid to:The Ritual of the Pentagram1.The Ritual of the Hexagram2.Establishing MalkoothMalkooth or ‘Kingdom’ is a complex sphere in that it represents several broad concepts simultaneously.It is at once, our feet when the Tree of Life is projected on the human frame (and the knees and base ofspine when seated or kneeling); all solid matter, earth, and all material creation. It is our bones, and themarrow they contain is a personal aspect of the Secret Fire. It is important that we have a strong sense offoundation when we talk about Earth and Malkooth, so that in meditation we can remain grounded andsecure. The stronger our sense of connection to the earth and our bodies we have, the more energy wecan generate and the easier it will be to direct it. It is analogous to trying to build a skyscraper on apoured slab concrete for a foundation verses a four-story subbasement. The better the foundation, thestronger the structure.Since the Secret Fire is hidden in the Earth, it is good to spend some time, even several years, workingthrough the details of the Pentagram rituals. Cleansing, harmonizing, projecting, and withdrawing theenergy represented there into yourself and surrounding area. The North is an especially important areafor concentration, in that it is Earth of Earth, and is our hidden gateway to the Secret Fire. Buried in thesolid nature of matter, is a underlying vibrant energy that is continually pulsating, giving rise to formand life, and turning energy in matter and matter into energy. This underlying nature is illustrated in theSign of Taurus, the zodiacal sigil given to the North. In it we see the Moon crowning a circle with a dot inthe center, or the Sun. This combined lunar-solar sign for earthly nature points to the theory that allmatter is simply condensed sun light, or hidden fire.By associating the heaviness of Earth and the underlying heat it contains (the molten, volcanic core)with our feet, knees, and base of spine (and eventually our whole skeletal system), we can begin toexperience the literal network creation is formed from. This imagery is reinforced by the statement thatMalkooth and Kether are one. By imaging that an unlimited stream of energy is pulsating into and out ofcreation from the Ain Soph Aur at Kether, and then imaging the same for material creation as youenvision it, at Malkooth. All to often the spheres are imagined as being static beings or states, whennothing is farther from the truth. They are alive, dynamic, and constantly interacting with each other"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html11 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMand the energy-matter matrix. This interaction is most clearly seen on the Middle Pillar and the centralspheres. Kether-Tiphareth-Malkooth TriadIn Western and some Eastern esoteric practices, all exercises begin with a drawing down of energy fromthe Crown, or Kether. This is done because Kether, is on the edge of “non-existence” draws energy intoand out of being. This energy is then regulated, until it becomes manageable by our humanconsciousness, said to be somewhere around Chesed, on the Cosmic scale of things.On the personal level, Kether, or our personal Crown, regulates the flow of energy into and out of ourbodies. We then direct this energy through our brain and nervous system, until it becomes manageableby our consciousness. Just as Kether is the bridge between Being and Non-Being on the Cosmic Scale,our personal Kether is the bridge between energy and matter. In our personal being, this is the pinealgland.Malkooth is the final condensing of these Cosmic forces, and on the Cosmic Scale is all of materialcreation. On our personal level, it our physical bodies, and as an intermediary, the environment we liveand move in with others. Since Malkooth is a World, that of Asssiah, as well as a Sphere, it has its own“Kether aspect” or ability to create matter that goes from the most dense to most subtle. These subtlerforms of matter border on their own realm of “Non-Being” or that which crosses over from the purely material to the psychic. In our bodies this would be the prostate and sexual glands, perineum, and baseof the spine. The meeting place for these two polar aspects of our being and creation, is in the Heart Center, orTiphareth. Here, all of creation is harmonized and brought into a state of dynamic tension and vitalityaround an intelligent center. This intelligence direct the other aspect of creation so that they work inharmony with one another for the good of all. This is our heart pumping blood to all of our organs, ourpituitary gland, or “Master Gland” giving directions to all of our endocrine system, our Solar Plexus,regulating nerve energy in general; and the nucleus of each atom, cell, or the Sun in our solar system.In its role of chief mediator of forces, Tiphareth is constantly sending vital energy to all area of creation,and transmitting energy from the Crown, or highest abstract realms, to Malkooth, or the densist levels ofmatter. It in many ways, is the regulator of this energy to such s degree, that it can be said that matteritself is actually made by Tiphareth. In physical terms this means that all matter is nothing butcondensed light energy. In personal terms, its means that our bodies and environment are the creationof our deepest held thoughts.To help develop a more conscious and functional relationship between these three centers ofenergy-matter-consciousness exchange, the following exercise is suggested:Imagine a brilliant sphere of Light with a binding, almost point black center, just above or touching thetop of your head. Inhale, drawing down a shaft of this sphere into your Heart. Exhale, sending the shaftof light through your body and legs out the soles of your feet, into the molten center of the Earth. Inhaleagain, visualizing the fiery energy of this Center of the Earth moving up in a golden reddish stream toyour Heart. Hold it, energizing the heart in brilliant light. Exhale, seeing the light expand in heat, light,life energy, and power.It is important at this point, that the energy not only be coordinated with the inhalation, but be‘breathed up’ from the earth and not forced. This can be done by imagining a strong, flexible, hollowtube or canal running from the center of the earth, or feet, to the heart center. The energy can also beimagined running up the feet, as a pulse, entering the spinal column, and focusing energizing the heart area. Imagine after a period of time, that it is in the heart of the universe, and the adept, that matter andenergy meet and are created. Just as our ‘heart felt’ feelings direct the limitless energy of Kether into manifestation, so do they directmanifestation back to Kether, or elsewhere, if we desire.It is very important that the heart not be overheated, and that the energy once accumulated becirculated or discharged in some fashion. This can be into a talisman, a healing treatment, or into a glassof cold water which is then consumed. It can also be discharged out the solar plexus as a generalcirculation to the rest of the aura.In addition, the vowel sounds associated with the Rose+Cross ritual, or A.I.O. may be intoned aftercompetency in the basic techniques gave been acquired. First, practice intoning the sounds as a singlebreath, resonating from the center of your heart. After a while, begin splitting the sounds so that Aresonates with the head; I with the heart; and O with the Solar plexus. After a period of time, move the Osound down to the perineum where it will have a stranger affect on the ‘Malkooth’ sphere(s).

It also effects theprostrate gland in men.Yesod- Link Between the SelvesYesod sits astride the gateway to the invisible, and is the repository for all that ascends and descendsinto manifestation. It represents several key elements of our being, including our nervous system andbrain; psychic centers; unconscious yearnings and desires; and locus of memory. Through its sometimesdark and troubling, but always powerful waters, we can come into direct contact with our Holy GuardianAngel in Tipahreth. By imagining Yesod as a gateway that reflects up as well as down, we can learn todirect our psychic energies in either direction. This way, Yesod is more than just a doorway which weknock at and hope something is thrown out to us, but instead is a portal we can move through and exist consciously. While much of this early expansion will take place in dream states, such as lucid dreaming,and spontaneous astral projection, eventually a greater degree of control will emerge, in whichconsciousness is projected willfully and returns with full memory of its experiences.This state can be quicken though, by reinforcing Yesods link to Malkooth (for memory) and Tiphareth(willed consciousness). The following exercises are designed with these two goals in mind.After performing the Middle Pillar, focus your attention on Yesod. Imagine it as a large sphere extendingto the edges of your expanded aura, violet in color. Shrink it back to normal size and then imagine all ofyour physical energy, in malkooth, and through out your body, is moving up toward Yesod. This is yourability to move, manifest, and create in the material world. Imagine the spheres merge and becomeharmonious. Now, pull it up even further to Tiphareth, and bath the combined material andpsychic-sexual energy of Yesod in the golden light of Tiphareth, and feel the three merge into one. Afterseveral minutes project them back to their original positions.Imagine the light of Yesod as being simultaneously dual in nature, reflecting up toward Tiphareth anddown toward Malkooth.Move to Tiphareth and do the same, imagine its light reflecting down toward Yesod, and up towardKether, the source of all energy.Imagine the Elements as pure and perfect ideas, emanating from Tiphareth through a clear field ofYesod, and condensing into matter. Imagine your thoughts as pure and perfect ideas, being projectedfrom your heart, with the combined sexual-creative energy of Yesod, into manifestation in malkooth.Imagine the pure light and energy of Kether above your head, becoming accessible in Tiphareth, yourheart, and manifesting as pure creations in Malkooth, beneath your feet. Feel the energy reverse thisprocess, going from hard, cold, dense matter, to abstract energy forms, to pure, undifferentiated energy.In addition, the Clavis Rea Formula can be an effective illustrator of this point.Circulation of the Light, after the establishment of the spheres should be vivid, clear, and deep in thebody as well as extended out form it. This can be done is phases, with the first phases working gently onthe outside, forming broad bands of light, and increasing in density and power as they begin to reachdeep below the surface of the tissue, to the bones themselves. This helps to anchor the power in thebody, while expanding and clearing the aura. At all times, the energy should be palpable.The Fountain of Light should move through the spinal column slowly at first, and with greaterintensity and speed as experience progresses. The burst should be lively and bright, with a clear fluid likeflame coursing around the edges of the expanded aura, at a radius of three to four feet on all sides. Loseyour self in the flow of energy, as it passes through your body, out your head, into your feet, up your legs,purifying and energyzing as it goes.At the conclusion of the exercise, you may withdraw the energy into the sub-epidermal layer of yourbody, feeling it strengthen and energize the tissue, sinking into the bones and purifying the marrow, anessential element in long life and strong bones. This should also be done along the spinal cord, imaginingthat the soft tissue between the vertebrae are packed with energy and the nerve connections are strongand vital. The Rituals of the Pentagram and HexagramThe rituals of the Pentagram re use for directing the principle Elements of the material world (Assiah),matter-energy matrix closest to our consciousness, and the outer-materially directed personality of thisincarnation. It is through directing and purifying to some degree these Elements, that we can begin toturn our attention inward and have the Vision of our Higher Self, or Holy Guardian Angel, that exists inKether, communicated with in Tiphareth, and reflected to us in the subconscious of Yesod.The ego, or self-created image of self in relation to the material world is completely dominated by theserituals, and through them, we can adjust our sense of self, so that we may direct our energies toward"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html13 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMSelf. When this is done, we not only can converse with our Holy Guardian Angle, but realize that we andit are one and the same.The pentagram rituals can also be used in this same respect for creating material conditions that are toour advantage, as well as spiritual advancement. They can be used to create an near materialenvironment for the sustaining of planetary forces as well. In this aspect, the several rituals are oftencombined.The planetary rituals of the Hexagram represent the manipulation of inner and outer planetary forcesthrough our own psychic centers. They can result in direct physical manifestations of body orenvironment, or in interior experiences of an initiatic nature. Such initiations signify an expansion ofconsciousness, and increased activation of the psychic centers involved, and possible generalization ofthe effects to other centers. For example: a solar ritual will bring increased activity to the psychic ‘heart’center, but also to the pineal gland in the brain as it is solar in nature. A lunar ritual will bring increasedmemory and mental clarity, but also will stimulate the nervous system, and psychic centers generally, aswell as cyclic sexual impulses. A Venus ritual will stimulate the kidneys, sexual impulses, and increaseones sense of beauty, harmony, and artistic expression. It will also add power to all of the psychic centersas a result of Venus’ ‘prism effect’ on psychic energy if directed properly, and increase the flow of love tothe heart.Thus, each planet has its specific and general effects, as well as manifestations on the mental, emotional,and material planes. As we increase in awareness, and contact more consciously the various planetaryspheres within us, they will appear to take on an almost objective existence. In these semi-objectivestates, we can contact others of a similar vibration, or communicate with the various ‘beings’ of theinvisible world. These worlds also have degrees of density, hence the use of Elemental attributes in thevertical mode of expression. The densest world is Malkooth/Assiah, with each of the planets having a‘home’ in the Quarters, and Yetzirah is more subtle and given the attribute of Water, with its own specialrelationship to the Planets. Next, there is Briah, with its Airy, expansive nature, and peculiarrelationship to the planets, and finally, Atziluths fiery nature, from with the previous worlds are butdenser and more stable expressions. Just as our consciousness shifts in its relationship to things when itmoves to the astral from the material, it shifts again when it moves from the lunar astral to the solarastral, or mental worlds; and again when the move is from the Mental to the Spiritual.These shifts can best be explained as going from object relationships (material), to subject relationships(I-Thou), to direct relationships, and finally identity relationships. On earth we view things as objects separate from us. In the lunar astral we experience them a objects, but with a relationship to them. Inthe Solar astral, we experience a thing directly, that is we know it. In the Spiritual realm, we are it.This helps to explain some of the statements made about kundalini experiences in yoga, as well as themystical experiences of other esotericists. In kundalini, or Secret Fire experiences, the aspirant oftentalks of being ‘one with creation’, or having the ability to look inside the nature of things. This wouldindicate that the energetic impulses being released are expanding awareness to the level of Briah. Whenthe final level is reached, Atzilooth, we become like the Bibical Enoch “who walked with God and was nomore”.This framework also helps explain why many magicians succeed or fail at magic. The identity of‘another’ doing the work for us, is a very materialistic approach to magic. Later on, after experiencingthe reality and illusions of the astral worlds, the direct, or personal relationship is built, in which the magician sees the powers being directed as aspects of his or her self, and not exterior to their being. Thisform of expression is more akin to the level of the adapt, but also the mystic, and practitioner of yogawho visualized the chakras as inside their body and not exterior worlds, as in Western Pathworking. Atsome point however, all of these various viewpoints merge, and systems become blended in theexperiences and evolving psyche of the disciple. The difference is more as a point of origin, not as a finaldestination.Note of Caution!! It is very important that all of the following exercises are preceded by a period ofprayer and devotion to the Cosmic and that their fruits be offered as gifts to the Creator. They must alsobe started by invoking the energy from above in some fashion, be it the Qabalistic Cross, the MiddlePillar, the Clavis Rei, or simply as a beam of light coming from above, entering at the Crown, andterminating at the base of the spine or feet depending on your posture. This is critical of any negativeside effects are to be avoided or minimized, as only energy radiating from Kether can be contacted without creating an imbalance in our system. Here, we seek to use this energy to repair imbalances, notforget it, and inadvertently create new ones. Also, at the end of each meditation, return the energy to theCosmic either imaginatively, or by offering the fruits of your spiritual labor to God.Triangle of FireThe Triangle of Fire represents a specific aspect of Tiphareth and should be considered in relationship tothe Middle Pillar, although it can be performed independent of it, or as we will see, as an adjunctexercise to intensify the effects of both exercises."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html14 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMAfter establishing your working space, focus your attention on your heart. Imagine the great intertwinedStar or Shield of David, in gold, associated with this sphere. Feel the upper triangle radiating a pulsingheat, and the lower one, a running coolness. Imagine them turn into a combined fiery triangle of Fire,and glistening triangle of Water. In the center is a brilliant dot, Yod, or Shin, as you decide.The lower triangle of Water is our relationship of consciousness to the psychic and material worlds. TheUpper triangle of Fire, is our relationship to the spheres of adepthood, spiritual illumination, andinterior revelation.Imagine yourself as the center point, between these two living triangles. Turn your attention to the FireTriangle. Let the Water Triangle fade from consciousness. Feel yourself in the center of a small pyramidof Fire. It you were to stand up, you could touch the apex. Seated or kneeling, you sense the great fire allaround you. Surrounding the base of the pyramid is a giant serpent with its tail in its mouth. Close youreyes and feel with each breath, and heart beat, the fire pulse in unison and grow more intense. The fireradiates both outward from the pyramid, as well as inward to its center, where you are. Loose yourself inthe pulsing, living, flame. Intone the Divine Name IAO, resonating it outward from the center of yourheart to the edges of the universe. Feel the fire grow bright with each vibration and the serpent stir.At some point you may feel, or imagine the serpent rising, and reaching a point of extension. Go with it,and view through its eyes. Return when you are done, by imagining the serpent coil back, placing its tailback in its mouth, the fire regulating, and the triangle merging with the triangle of water, both turninggold, and exiting to consciousness.Saturn and the Secret FireThis is special series of exercises relating to Saturn and its relationship to other planets, and the asmanifestor of Creation. This exercise is directly related to the previous one, or The Triangle of Fire.When placed on the Tree of Life, the Hexagram connects the spheres of Yetzirah and Briah, giving agateway to Atzilooth, with Saturn where Daath is placed.The Triangle of Fire is composed of Saturn at the apex, and Mercury and Venus at the base corners, withthe Sun in the center. By meditating on the qualities of these planets, and their relationship to eachother via this diagram, we can see that Saturn is the secret sphere, that offers us access to theenergy-matter-consciousness continuum. Imagine yourself in the center of the Triangle of Fire again,pacing the Astrological signs, or godforms of Saturn, above, or above and before your, Mercury at yourright, and Venus at your left. See them as living and vital, with a thin strand of fire, light, and love,connecting them. Remember, Saturn is often given as the sign for matter, and Venus inverted as the sign for Antimony, orthe Earth. Continue this meditation for several weeks, or once a week, for several months. Fifteen totwenty minutes is all that is needed.YHVHThe following method of meditation is based upon the fundamental associations known to every studentof kabbalah. It can be performed by experienced or novice students alike, although novices should spendmore time on the fundamentals to insure success later on, without having to go back an repeat thebasics. This series of exercises relates to the stages and Elements of Creation and the nature of the Primordial orarchetypal expressions of consciousness. Those who have experience working with Hebrew and/or theElements as outlined in basic magical practices will be able to move more quickly through this exercise.Those who have little or no experience in magic will find it a suitable and powerful introduction to theseconcepts on a very personal level.The Hebrew doctrine of Creation sets forth the idea that the Primordial Man, or Adam was composed ofthe four lettered name of God stacked in vertical form to appear as sort of stick figure being. In addition,all of creation could be found to have it origin in this sacred name, and it pronunciation was closelyguarded, so much so, that it is now lost. The discovery of its proper intonation is said to bring power overeverything, so much so, that there are schools of kabbalah that only work with the various manipulationsof this Name as their form of meditation.For us, the Tetragrammaton will be used as a visual and mnemonic guide for our meditations andexercises designed to release the Secret Fire in Creation.The standard Elemental applications will be applied: Yod (Head, endocrine system) is associated withFire; Heh (shoulders/chest, and cardiopulmonary system) with Air; Vau (Spine/Nervous system,including sense organs) with Water; and the Final Heh with the dot (the hips, legs and feet, and skeletalsystem) with Earth.The dot in the final Heh symbolizes the secret, hidden point of light, life, and love in all of creation, and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html15 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMhidden in matter. It is this secret force that when liberated brings us to the heights of divine bliss andconsciousness in the original Fire of Yod.As with all exercises, begin by drawing energy, in some fashion, down from Kether to the Earth. This canbe through the Kabbalistic Cross, the Middle Pillar, or the Psychic Pump as previously described. Once acalm center is established, and a sacred space to contain the energy, either through the PentagramRitual, or imagining a vast and empty dome sphere around you (about six to nine feet in diameter), youmay proceed.Imagine the Primordial Man in front of you, vast and towering. Merge with the image, growing in size asyou do. See the flaming Yod as your head, and imagine that it, or a ray from it, projects itself downwardthrough the Airy world. Forming the first Heh, and continues into the Watery world, gaining density andweight, forming the Vau, and finally, into the world of solid matter, forming it, along with the Final Heh.There, the flame grows small, flickering brightly, but only as a small spark, compared to its vast andbrilliant place of origin, and to the dark, cold, solid world of matter in which if now appears trapped.Identify with the solid earth. Feel your feet rooted to it. Imagine that they, your legs, knees, and hips, areall heavy, solid, and firm, immovable and dense. Feel and imagine the great strength and stability thatthis offers you and appreciate it, as it is the foundation of your being. Continue with this imagery, andsense a point of dense, brilliant, heat and light in the center of this dark, solid matter. See it growbrighter and stronger, as though it were the center of the Earth itself. Continue with this heat and light,and let a strand of it move up from the center of the earth, through the layers of solid matter and rock toyour feet, forming a sphere of great heat and light. After several days, pull the energy up to your knees. After several more days, pull it up to your hips. Afterabout a month of practice, pull it up and focus it at the base of your spine.Extend the solid earth imagery to include your skeletal structure as well. Breath the fire up from thecenter of the earth, feel it focus around your spine, and move up to the top of your head. Imagine thatyour head is an empty sphere, waiting to receive the energy from below. Feel the energy coursethroughout your body, focusing on the bones. Breath it into them, cleansing them of any weakness ordisease. See the marrow inside grow, and fill them with its bright red power. Extend it across the skull,jaw, and teeth. As before, when you are done with the meditation, absorb as much energy as you can,and send the rest to the center of the earth, closing off the contact.After a month or two of this exercise, move on to the Vau. See the energy move through your feet, to thespine, and move up and through its narrow center column to the brain. Imagine that as it enters thespinal column, with each breath, the fluid contained therein, course up and across your brain, nurturingthe tissue, and descending back down. Imagine your senses becoming stronger and more acute. Visualizethe vast fiery energy coming form the center of the earth as increasing your psychic sensitivity andpsychic centers. This can be imagined simply as the nervous system becoming bright and healthy.Then, move on to the next, or First Heh. Here sense the energy as having moved up your feet, into thespine, and when it reaches the upper body and back of the head, it also fills the lungs with greater powerand expansion. Feel yourself lifted up and expanded, as though your vision was made clearer, and senseof purpose, and destiny more definite. Imagine the lungs being charged with bright, warm healingenergy, vitalizing the breath and blood.After a few days, imagine the vital power moving from the middle of the shoulders, down the arms, andto the hands. During this period experiment with projecting, circulating, and receiving energy through your hands. Ingeneral, the right hand should project positive, expansive, electrical energy; and the left should projectmagnetic, passive, and receptive energy. By holding the hands together, in the classic prayer position, infront of the chest with the back of your thumbs just touching the sternum, the heart center can beenergized. In addition, the energy circulated creates a psychic ‘belt’ or ‘dome’ around the upper portionsof the head and shoulders. Practice pulling energy down from the sun, moon, planets, and Cosmicthrough the left hand and into the earth or a talisman with the right.Use the classic Sign of the Philosophus, or hands raised above the head with thumb and forefingerstouching to form a triangle, to pull energy down into both palms and out through your feet. Try storing itin your solar plexus (you may want to use the Sign of Practicus for this) and projecting it as previously described.[9]Then, move to the Yod. Here after the energy has moved up to the brain, see the head grow bright andluminous. Feel it absorb the fire from below and rejoicing its return. Sense the center of your headgrowing powerful, warm, and bright. Focus on this single point of brightness, and then send it backdown to the earth, while reaching out to the universe with it. Feel yourself lost in s fiery world ofprimordial power, wisdom, and love. Feel as though you are of vast stature, towering immensely throughout the solar system. Feel as though the planets themselves are your psychic centers, and the sun is yourheart, the Earth your footstool and the original point of creation your crown. When you are done, shrink"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html16 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMyourself back, and shut down the meditation. This energy once experienced has tremendous healing potential. By freeing our negative and destructivethoughts into the center of the earth for purification and renewal, we open ourselves to a more energyand expanded consciousness through the removal of psychological blocks. Through drawing up the fieryhealing energy of the earth, and packing it slowly, smoothly, and methodically deep into our cells, formthe bones and its marrow upward and outward, we can increase our psychic sensitivity to telluriccurrents, weather patterns, and magnetic conditions. In addition, we add strength, energy, and vitalityto our physical bodies.[10]The Flashing Sword and the Rising SerpentYesod, Hod, and Netzach in the Secret FireThis section examines the relationship between the sepheroth of the Tree of Life to the Secret Fire, andthe impact of two spheres in particular that govern the nervous system, early psychic awakening, andsexual power.The rising of psychic power from Malkooth, effects not only the feet and perineum, but also triggers aresponse in the adrenals atop the kidneys. This is often accompanied by a surge of energy, as theseglands are the seat of out ‘fight or flight’ response. They are also secondary sexual organs, and as theenergy drops down, to enter into the base of the spine (also a Malkooth center) before rising up thespinal cord and erergyzing the entire body, it stimulates those nerves and psychic clusters associatedwith Yesod and Netzach. It is from this stimulation that images, fantasies, sexual potency andaggressiveness, and psychic awareness, sometimes bordering on pszophrenia and psychosis, areexperienced. Intense heat and a sense of purging may also be experienced as a result.When the energy reaches the area of Hod, or Mercury, usually prior to Netzach, but not always, it is saidto be following the Path of the Serpent. This Path is illustrated by a Serpent climbing the Tree of Life,reversing the direction of the descent of the Lightning Flash. Here, the Secret Fire awakens the mind tomagical possibilities and structures, but without power. It may energize the brain and speedup patternsof thought, insight, and association, but often this may be vented through excessive talking andverbalization, or routing it through the throat center.If the energy is not spent, but directed in its upward Path of Return, or ascent, then the very realproblem of having to direct the will and consciousness in a singular fashion toward creating a pathwayfor the energy to flow is encountered. These pathways are the mental and astral constructs, or symbols,used in magical, religious, and esoteric rites.The principle pathway, or map used to direct the Secret Fire is the caduceus of Mercury. Here, the twinserpents intertwine themselves around the central pillar, and themselves form two side or supportingpillars, leading to a winged apex, or crown, shaped like a pine cone, or the pineal gland.When it reaches this point, then Crown, it bestows illumination, Cosmic Consciousness, and can bedirected further towards greater spiritual activity, or toward material or psychic manifestation. Thisenergy, or light, is like the rays of the sun (Tiphareth) being split into the many rays of the spectrum(Netzach) by the use of optical filters (Hod).In Hod we not only create, but also clean any existing mental filter, so that the energy rising backtowards its source may be properly identified and experienced for what it is, prior to its beingharmonized into a single ray of light by Netzach. Even after harmonization however, the energy may nothave to be returned to the Tiphareth. If left to its own devises, it probably will, as that is its naturalinclination. The sudden influx of power and energy may create a strengthening of the recently vivifiedastral worlds, of which Netzach is the symbolic apex.The Death card which rules the Path between Netzach and Tiphareth signifies the task of the initiate atthis stage of the journey, and of the sacrifice that lies ahead. Only by loosing their individuality, orthrough ‘death’, can the separate forces under the direction of Netzach combine to lead the initiatetoward adepthood. The reverse of this is also true in one sense, in that by leaving the collective behind,the individual is born, the true individual of Tiphareth. This suggests, that genuine initiation can onlytake place when we are no longer dependent upon the collective power of an egregore for our sense ofprotection, purpose, and illumination. The watery astral womb of Yetzirah must be left, for either the dryair of Malkooth’s material life, or Tiphareth’s spiritual renewal.Along with the intertwined serpents of the caduceus, we find implied in the symbolism the chakras, orpsychic centers, upon which the Secret Fire acts in its journey. These centers express modes ofconsciousness, loci of physical and psychic power, and are related in various ways to the nervous andendocrine systems as we have seen.In Western esotericism, several methods of expressing these psychic centers exist. There is the use of theplanetary names, or mundane chakras as they are called, for the sepheroth. Here, the planets follow the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html17 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMdescent of mezla, or Divine Energy, down the Tree of Life and are placed at corresponding locations onthe human body. Kether, Hockman, and Binah are in the head; Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphareth are inthe upper chest and shoulders; Netzach, Hod, and Yesod in the hips and sexual organs; with Malkoothlocated at the feet. This works well as a mnemonic devise and for the exercise known as the Flashing Sword and Rising Serpent, but is not very useful when it comes to attributing planetary powers tospecific organs, as in alchemy.Another set of attributes is to simply take the Middle Pillar and apply either its Elementalcorrespondences as given by Regardie The True Art of Healing, or the more well known planetarycorrespondences as he gives in his book The Middle Pillar. Along the same lines, it is not uncommon toapply the ascending set of Hindu tattwas, or Elemental signs in an ascending manner at each of thecross-bars and spheres on the central column of the Tree of Life.While none of the above sets of designating centers of psychic force is perfect, each works in its ownparticular area, and as such, it might be better to simply accept the symbols given for each exercisewithout trying to create ‘a grand synthesis’ that will sound good, but be cumbersome or useless forpractical purposes.Looking at the ascent of energy from a more Western viewpoint, it is possible to view the psychic centersnot as singular and specific organs, but in many instances as clusters of organs working in concert.Students of Eastern esoteric practices will recognize that the New Age system of seven chakras neatlyarranged with an ascending chromatic scale is not easily found in yoga or tantra.Instead, what is found, is just as much contradiction and confusion as in modern synthetic Westernesoteric systems. Whether one uses a system of five, six, or seven psychic centers depends on whichsystem is being practiced. The addition or subtraction of a particular center matters only in relations tothe details of that particular practice and its aims. Thus, when viewing the psychic cneters as objectiverealities, we enter into a realm fraught with danger. Instead, we need to look at the centers in terms offunction and relationship to each other. If in an exercise we notice that a centers activities are notlimited to the feet, chest, sexual organs, or head, then we have entered into a deeper understanding ofthat locus of energy. If we find that other organs are being stimulated as well, then we will find that wehave begun moving from a strictly symbolic and mental relationship to the psychic centers to a personaland experiential one. This transition to personal experience is what development is all about, and notsimply neat and comfortable packages of occult lore and information as is given in endless tables ofcorrespondences.In one recent Golden Dawn publication[11] a set of correspondences was given for four of the majorpsychic centers using kerubic attributions. The root center was attributed to the Calf of Revelations; thesexual center to the Angel; the Solar Plexus to the Lion; and the Eagle to the heart. No Correspondenceswere given for the remaining centers. Using this as a basis for discussion and experimentation, I wouldinstead suggest the following listing as a more effective alternative:1st Bull or Saturn[12] or Moon[13] with Fire in the Heart2nd Eagle or Jupiter or Mercury Water in the liver3rd Lion or Mars or Venus Earth in the lungs4th Angel or Venus or Sun Air in the bladder5th Spirit or Mercury or Mars6th Luna or Moon or Jupiter7th Sol or Sun or SaturnThis suggests that the order of the planets in the spheres is very relative to ones state of consciousness,and that the correspondences at the time of our descent into material consciousness may be differentfrom the order during our re-ascent into Eternity.If we consider what the alchemists say about Saturn, that it is the beginning and end of the Work, thenthis re-arrangement of the centers may be true.In an article entitled, “From The Restored New Testament”[14], the basic idea of four centers of thegenitals, navel, heart, and head is used along with titles taken from The Book of Revelations of St. John.Genitals 1st and 2nd centers The False SeerNavel 3rd center The Red DragonHeart 4th center The BeastHead 5th, 6th, and 7th centers The Cross, The Lamb, The Spiritually Wise, and Illumination TheConqueror In an accompanying chart, the order of the planets is given from Saturn at the base, to Luna at theCrown, in straight kabbalistic fashion, with a slightly different color scale than usual: Yellow andsliver-white (Saturn), pale blue (Jupiter), red (Mars), green (Sun), dark blue/indigo (Venus),orange-yellow (Mercury), violet, silvery opalescent (Moon). Each center is also associated with a zodiacal"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html18 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMsign, a seal on the great scroll, and one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The remaining fivesigns of the zodiac are attributed to the Elements and Spirit.The problem presented by the Book of Revelations, is that if it represents a pattern of progressive interior initiation linked to the ultimate experience of the Secret Fire, it is written in a highly symbolicformat. Many of the keys to these symbols may be very local and period specific in origin, requiringextensive research into 1st century era Gnostic, Christian, Merkavah, and Greco-Roman initiaticpractices.This is not to imply that this is an impossible nut to crack, only that it is one wherein we must weigh thereward against the effort. To assist those who answer this in the affirmative, the above keys have beengiven. For this manuscript however, it raises more questions than horns on “The Beasts” head, to whichthe answers are not immediately forthcoming. The answers may be in some of the older and lessaccessible schools of Christian kabbalah found in Eastern Orthodoxy, more so than in those Christiankabbalists of Rome, as they are more focuses on the Gospel of John, and have not completely rooted outtheir mystical wing, or use of symbols for Illumination.Exercise After preparing your oratory, or place of working, imagine that your spine is the central pillar of theCaduceus. Establish it well, with a round bottom, wings at level of the throat, solar disk, and a pine coneor brilliant knob at the top. Visualize it in white or reddish-gold, with the left serpent in blue or black;and the right serpent in red. Their tails should meet or cross-over at the base of your spine and continueto overlap five more times with their heads facing toward each other, tongues extended, at the level ofthe throat accompanied by an extended pair of wings. The image should be mounted by a solar disk atthe level of the head, surmounted by a pine cone. After a period of several weeks with the above imagery, additional symbols can be added. In the center ofeach circle formed should be imagined in progressive order, the kerubic animals listed above. At thelevel of the throat should be akasha, or Spirit; and the Lunar qualities should dominate the back of thehead, with Solar dominating the front. Both universal aspects are imagined as unified at the top, andentering and existing through the brilliant sphere or pine cone (pineal gland).If possible, the left serpent should be imagined to have lunar, watery, passive, magnetic qualities. Theright serpent, solar, electric, fiery, expansive qualities. The central column mediates, balances, andcontains both simultaneously.After the above images are successfully imagined and maintained, the symbols can be progressivelymeditated upon. It is important to go in strict order from top to bottom or bottom to top. If a psychicblockage is encountered don’t force it. Simply smooth it away gently as you progressively move throughthe set of symbols. Don’t spend more than seven or ten days on any one symbol. Remember, that it isbest to start new esoteric periods on a Saturday when the psychic power is at its height for the week. Thismeans that it will take a minimum of seven weeks to move through the seven principle symbols on thecentral column, and an additional three weeks for the basic diagram and two serpents.This is a strong exercise, so don’t force it. It anything unpleasant is experienced, shorten the periods ofmeditation. Initially, no more than 15 minutes should be spent on this exercise.The Serpent of Fire and the Spear[15]Of all the exercises in this work, the following are the easiest to perform regardless of the level ofexperience of the operator. Their basic concepts will already be familiar to many students, and are usefulas guides in a fundamental understanding of the Secret Fire that exists in the West.Visualize a vast point if brilliant light above your head, so intense that it appears black. Move it down tothe top of your head, feel it sinking into your body and psyche, permeating your consciousness. Fee itmove out, extending to form a sphere of golden light and fire around you to a diameter of four to six feeton all sides. Let this sphere of light grow in intensity and power, and know that it is a strong containerfor the Cosmic forces you are about to invoke.Imagine a shaft of fire, like a spear, blaze down from the point of light above you, penetrate your skull,and move through your body and into the center of the earth. Feel the earth reverberate with its impact,and imagine a stream of living fire, like a golden-red serpent, move in the reverse direction of the shaft,up your spine, and into the hallow of your skull. It is important that you imagine your skull as a hollowand vast receptacle of this creative and transforming energy. After several repetitions of this cycle, focusyour attention on your heart, and imagine there, a chalice, stone, or other receptive symbol for yourhighest Self. Wait for a response, and then let everything merge into a vast sea of living golden light, fire,and love. At the conclusion of the exercise, draw the energy into yourself, and offer it as a gift to theCosmic. Basic exercises for its regulation"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Secret Fire: The Relationship Between Kundalini, Kabbalah, and Alchemyhttp://www.hermetic.com/stavish/essays/secret-fire.html19 of 211/21/2007 6:44 AMSolar Plexus as chief regulator of energy in the bodyIf after an exercise there is too much energy in your heart or head area, move it down to the solar plexusand imagine it being circulated out and around your body through that center. This will work after a fewminutes, and is especially good for circulating energy that arises from sexual stimulation after theseexercises.Grounding outIt is important to establish firm points of Kether and Malkooth in these exercises. If Malkooth isinsufficiently established, the risk of flightieness and disconnectedness from everyday life is possible.More importantly, if a strong sense of connectedness is not established at Malkooth, much of the energywill have no where to go, and will be wasted. If it appears that too much energy has been generated andis causing problems that simply circulating it out the Solar Plexus will not solve, then consider thefollowing:1.Imagine the energy streaming our of your hands and feet into the earth.2.Place your hands in a bowl of cold water and imagine the energy pouring into it.3.Walk on the grass or earth with your feet in direct contact.4.Drink a cold glass of water.These suggestions are for the discharge of energy accumulations that may be unpleasant. Consider thema sort of psychic first aid. The nature of these exercises generally, is to increase the amount of energy wecan handle, and to direct it wisely and slowly for the purification of our psyche and body. Discharging itrepeatedly will slow that process, however, maintaining a state of irritation, frustration, andperterbability as a result of esoteric practices is also a drawback.Circulating the LightSimply put, always circulate the energy when you are done with an exercise. The suggestions of theMiddle Pillar, or out the Solar Plexus and around the edges of the extended aura work well.####Additional Notes for ConsiderationCrowley states that the 24th Path is attributed to the Goddess Kundalini in 777. Knight has the caduceuswith the sign of Scorpio at the bottom. Scorpio is the sign of the 24th Path.Square breathing is to be done with the exercises whenever possible. On the inhale, pull the energy downfrom the crown; hold in the feet, earth, and/or base of spine; exhale to head; hold on the exhale. Repeat.This adds a great deal of energy to the exercises and limits the amount of time they can be done in anyone sitting.Each sphere has its own Tiphareth, i.e. Great Star, uniting the smaller “spheres within a sphere” on theTree of that particular level. Thus, when we direct our attention to the harmonizing influence ofTiphareth we effect all of the planets it touches. When we direct our attention to the Triangle of Fire ofTiphareth, we effect the Fire aspect of all of the Spheres connected to Tiphareth. However, Saturn,Mercury, and Venus, may have a greater response. This of course means, karma (Saturn), creativeenergy (Venus), and intellect/energy conduits (Mercury).As such, it then is easier to regulate planetary energy with the hexagram than the septagram. Thehexagram regulates energy via Tiphareth, the septegram via Netzach.In alchemy, Fire and Air are the matrix of Energy; Water and Earth are the matrix of Matter. Earth‘energy’ is essential for sustaining health; Water for sustaining initiation; and Fire for initiation itself;Air makes Fire accessible.Salt is the lower yetzirah and assiah; Mercury is Higher Yetzirah and Lower Briah; Sulphur is HigherBriah and Lower Atzilooth. Salt is prone to lunar impulses. Mercury is prone to solar impulses. Sulphur is prone to zodiacal andCosmic impulses.
