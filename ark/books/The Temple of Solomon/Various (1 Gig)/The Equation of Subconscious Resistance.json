The reduction of R is the prime concernof metamorphosis and behavior/cognitive modification. For thepurposes of this paper, when “behavioral pattern” is used itis referring to both behaviors and cognitive processes ofbehaviors.R is defined here as a behavioral pattern that has becomeingrained in the “subconscious” processes of the practitioner,which influence would be negative toward an operation ofmagic. In order to determine the power of R, the strength of a behavior pattern must be determined. The strength of abehavior pattern can be determined by analyzing the factorsinvolved. Following the excellent theoretical framework ofThomas Brown2, the behavioral strength can be determined bythe length of time the behavior has been occurring (L), the frequency of the behavioral occurrences (F), and the connection of the behavior to other behavioral patterns orother stimuli (C)3. Place these three variables on a scalefrom 1 to 10 (1 being: (L) never, (F) not at all, (C) none.And 10 being (L) a very long time, (F) always, (C) many). Thenadd the three scores and multiple them by 3.333 and divide theresult by 100 and round up to the nearest hundredth. Thisgives the behavior strength a number ranging between 0.1 and1.0, 0.1 being a very weak behavioral pattern and 1.0 being avery strong and entrenched behavioral pattern. In the eventthat the behavior being quantified actually promotes theoccurrence of the magical activity, then R is not at issue.In summation: R = ((L+F+C)*3.333)/100Therefore:M = GL(1-A)(1-((L+F+C)*3.333)/100)If the behavior pattern quantification is on the low end ofthe spectrum, the probability of success will be increaseddepending on the other variables."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/equation.html2 of 21/22/2007 6:38 PMIf the behavior pattern quantification is too high thepossibility that the operation will be a success will approach0. In order to circumvent this from happening, the behaviorpattern must be altered. This can be accomplished throughmetamorphosis and a multitude of magical operations with thechange of behavior as the intention. However, magicaloperations to modify the behavior must take the behavioralquantification into account and will probably result in a lowprobability of success as well. Metamorphosis techniquesdevised by the practitioner and traditionalbehavioral/cognitive modification should then be employed. Theemployment of various techniques to reduce R should be aimed at reducing F and C, as L may be hard to manipulate at theoutset. It is important to note that the behavior will put upresistance to alteration and the practitioner will have to exceed this resistance in order to ultimately change R.It is hoped that this expansion assists in furthering theanalytical examination of the variables of magic.

Edinburgh: James Ballantyne.3 It is to be noted that Brown identified a total of nine associations thatimpacted behavior. The three included here are evidentially some of themost powerful associations. The practitioner is encouraged to examine theother associations and include them in the calculation and makemodifications to the calculation process to reflect the included factors."}]
