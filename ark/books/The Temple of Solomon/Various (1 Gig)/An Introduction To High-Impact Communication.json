Sex.If you’re like most people, when you see or hear words likethose above, you get a little bit of a jolt.But saying words like power and money and sex isn’t the onlyway to have emotional impact on other people.In fact, when someone knows how to use the other dimensionsof human communication—how to coordinate the way he or she talkswith what he or she says—that person can grab your attention just assecurely as a bouncer pins your arms behind your back.And not just grab your attention—someone who knows how tospeak to your gut instincts, the emotional part of your mind, can makeyou want what you didn’t realize you wanted, and open your mind topossibilities you didn’t know you could have.You can develop this power. You can learn to reach beneathpeople’s “reasons,” so that you can guide and drive their gut responses,open and inflame their imaginations. You can learn how to lead, inspire,motivate, and connectConventional communication—the way most people go abouttrying to get others to change opinions, beliefs, and behavior—assumesthat facts and arguments guide feelings and beliefs, and therefore, thatfacts and arguments guide behavior.Synchronized communication, or, as we call it, GutTalk, assumesthat feelings and beliefs drive behavior, and, for that matter, that feelingsand beliefs determine how facts and arguments will be interpreted.GutTalk addresses someone’s feelings and instincts, in order tochange that person’s idea of “the facts”.And Sexual Key shows you how to use the structure of femalelanguage and emotion to emotionally bond with and sexually arousewomen extremely quickly—in the space of a conversation. Women arewaiting for entirely different signals than the ones men feel and usuallysend—Sexual Key shows you how to send those signals, so you cantouch women’s emotions and make them feel incredibly good, while atthe same time arousing them sexually."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4.GUTTALK is a method of moving the listener’s feelings byignoring the rational part of his or her mind, and speakingdirectly to his or her emotions.Ordinary speechaims at the intellect.The listener’sintellect interpretsand analyzes thisspeech.After the intellecthas interpreted thisspeech, the listener’sinstincts andemotions respond.GUTTALK aims forthe gut.GUTTALK speaksto the instincts intheir own language.It is therefore morepowerful andcompelling."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"52. Monkey Hear, Monkey Feel Many years ago, I was sitting at a café when a fairly average-looking man in his late thirties sat down nearby a striking young blondeof nineteen or twenty. She paid no attention to him. Within a fewminutes, though, he had started telling her of how she resembled a friendof his in college. He went on to talk about how much he’d loved college,and how much he’d enjoyed traveling when in college, and how muchhe’d enjoyed meeting people in college, and how much he’d enjoyedtravelling and meeting people and getting laid when in college. He wenton and on, talking about how friends of his had travelled to Berlin, andbeen picked up by strangers; how he had gone to Paris, and been pickedup in a café; how wonderful it was to suddenly become attracted to astranger. He proceeded to recount increasingly improbable stories he’dread, he claimed, in the newspaper, of a drunken man climbing in thewrong window and making love to a woman not his wife; of a womanwho decided to quit her boring job and start her own business, themoment she found herself falling for a stranger who entered herworkplace one day; of a rock band questioned by the police because ofsex acts they were alleged to have performed with groupies during apublic performance. Etc. The stories this fellow told were increasingly unrelated; in fact,they were linked only by their theme: Sex. And was the young lady upset or embarrassed by this? Well, her face and upper chest were certainly red. And shebegan to quiver in her seat. And she often seemed to stop breathingentirely. And her mouth was slightly agape, and her pupils looked as bigas nickels. So, no, she wasn’t upset—she was really turned on. In time,when the man’s friend and ride appeared, such that the man had to go,the girl ripped open her purse and hurriedly scribbled her number withoutthe man even asking for it. She made him promise to call her. As you can imagine, this incident gave me some food forthought. In case you’re wondering, the man’s success in this case wasn’tdependent on extraordinary luck—the chance of finding the one womanin a million aroused by such talk.

I like receiving that kind of email, and knowing that you nowknow how to make the people around you—especially women—feelincredibly good, in ways that stun them. Words are tools for giving other people new experiences; ifsomeone else hasn’t seen a whale rise up and spout water into the air, yetyou have, you can put the things you saw, heard, and felt at the time intowords, convey these words to your listener, and your listener will beginto imagine the experience. As he or she begins to imagine theexperience, he or she will begin to feel some of the sensations described,because the unconscious mind must identify with an experience, mustfeel it, in order to understand it. As it happens, the approach taken by the man with the youngblonde was successful—but it was also terribly, terribly inefficient.You can arouse women much more quickly, and the products offered bywww.sexualkey.com will show you how."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"73. The Basics, or How Powerful Communication Works Powerful, effective communication a) grabs the listener’sattention, and b) spurs the listener’s feelings and imagination indirections the communicator wants. The first effect, in which your listener becomes drawn into whatyou are saying and comes to pay more attention to it, than, for example,the fact you are both standing on a street corner, or the fact that thestoplight has changed, or the fact that your listener ought to be rushing toan appointment--in short, the effect wherein your listener is enjoyinglistening to you and is more interested in what you are saying than inother things--we'll call Engagement. ENGAGEMENT STIMULATION"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 The second effect, in which as you talk at length about yourweekend in Tahoe, your listener begins visualizing ski slopes, trees, thedull and filtered winter sun, warm fireplaces, warm beverages, andbearskin rugs--and not only visualizes, but imagines, subtly, feeling whatit would be like to have these experiences, we’ll call Stimulation. Engagement is getting your listener absorbed in what you are saying. Stimulation is getting your listener to imagine experiencing what youare talking about.  "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"94. The Head and the Gut, or The Two Ways We Handle InformationBecoming a great communicator is easy, if you think of the personyou’re communicating to as being made of two separate parts. These twoseparate parts, which, for simplicity’s sake, we’ll call the Head and theGut, handle information in very different ways.THE HEADThe Head distinguishes causes from effects,assigns names, and interprets complex language.THE GUTThe Gut associates experiences with emotional states,looks for relationships, and moves toward what is similar or familiar.The Head uses words and logic to analyze and communicateinformation. That is, the Head picks information apart, tries to put labelson it, compares it to existing beliefs, thinks about what factors caused itand what effects it will have on other things, plans future steps andmakes decisions. Emotionally detached, the Head uses symbol systemslike language and mathematics to store and communicate complexinformation.The Gut responds to information through that information’semotional associations. If a particular stimulus or piece of information isexperienced at the same time a strong feeling is being experienced,should that stimulus or datum be experienced again, the Gut will againfeel something of the strong feeling that came with it before. Astorehouse of experience and accumulated lessons, it relies on habitrather than planning or decision to guide its responses. The Gut can"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10distort or delete new information in order to maintain present habits andbeliefs. It understands and communicates with bodily feeling, bodilymovement, metaphor, and a vast range of subtle cues.The Head makes plans and expresses ideas in words.The Gut provides or withholds the emotional energy necessary tocarry out your plans and make your words compelling to others. Itexpresses itself through the way your words actually sound and the wayyou look and move as you say them. Guiding action in accordance withits habits and impulses, it frequently overrides the Head’s plans,decisions, and ideas.To change someone’s behavior, you must change the emotionsassociated with that behavior; that is, you must move the Gut.This, incidentally, is why debates rarely change the opinions andemotions of those with strongly held beliefs—why two guests on Sundaymorning political talk shows, though of relatively similar intelligence andeducation, can argue round and round for hours, neither making a dent inthe others’ convictions. Debates are intellectual in nature; the Gut easilydeletes and distorts inconvenient facts. This is also why insights spawnedin the therapist’s office and resolutions made on New Year’s Eve areboth so often to no lasting effect; products of the Head, they may nothave the support of the Gut."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"115. The Means, or What the Gut WantsWords produce thoughts and gut responses--even words not socharged as power and money and sex. And words that seem to us true,words that exactly match what we are already thinking or that matchwhat we can see and hear and feel, make us pay attention and eager tohear (and feel) more. This is because the instinctive part of the mind isengaged by having its own experiences and perceptions, its own model ofthe world, fed back to it.The instinctive part of the mind is always seeking sustained,accurate feedback; when it receives it, it opens up so as to learn andexperience as much as possible.When the mind opens up like this, it’s easy for it to think and dothings it otherwise would not or could not.We can also put the matter this way:On a rational, analytical level, the Other person (hereafter calledO) wants new information, wants to understand things, wants to makeplans, wants to get from point A to point B.On an emotional, instinctual level, O wants information that istrue—that is, information which he/she can verify with his/her eyes andears and fingers, or information that fits what he/she already believes.To make someone completely focused on what you’re tellinghim/her—to engage that person’s instincts and imagination, express anuninterrupted series of things which he/she can verify with his/her sensesas being accurate, and/or an uninterrupted series of opinions with whichhe/she agrees.When you say many things your listener can immediately verify asaccurate according to his/her sensory perceptions and abstractbeliefs, your listener’s emotions become engaged and his/herimagination opens up.ExerciseUsually after spending a little time with somebody you can get a prettygood feel for the sorts of ideas with which he or she would agree, and forthe ways he/she views things. Just for the sake of loosening up a bit and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12getting into the habit of trying things out, try the following simpleexercise.1) Sit down and talk with someone, such that you can see his or herface.2) At one point, speaking at a relaxed pace, express several ideas in along unbroken series which you think will accord generally withyour companion’s worldview, or better yet, offer a long series ofstatements--at least six or seven--which you’re pretty sure yourcompanion will feel are true and factual. You can say anything fromthe “The sky is blue” and “We’re sitting in an office” to “It’s true, Ishould have married you long ago,” depending on what you thinkyour listener will agree with.3) So that there is a smooth flow between these statements, link themwith prepositions such as and, as, while, so, since, and because.4) Observe his or her response. When, as you speak, your listenerbegins to seem either very focused on what you are saying or looksvery dreamy, give your listener an instruction, or a detaileddescription of an emotional state which you’d like him or her toexperience.5) Your instruction will have unusual force and impact.Example:“You’ve been sitting at this table for at least thirty minutes, andI see you’ve been sampling some of their coffee, and we’venever seen each other before, and I know nothing about you—nothing about where you’re from, or what you do, or whereyou’d be right now if you could be anywhere, or what you’dmost enjoy doing if you were there...but I think it would be greatto feel as comfortable as if you’re at the beach, feeling thesunlight relax you completely, just because this feels so good.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 6. A Conclusion which Presents an Invitation, Or, The Paths of Edgar and Gareth, In Their Entirety, As Recorded, Or, Fortunately, Not Another Damn Allegory of the Cave Well, now that you’ve caught a glimpse of some new tools, orperhaps see some new and better ideas of handling tools you’ve alwayshad, here’s a little story, which you can make a larger one. *** There once were two brothers, Edgar and Gareth. Edgar andGareth lived in a valley remarkable for its sheer quantity of trios ofbrothers, trios of sisters, only children, wicked stepmothers, and rivalroussiblings who choose different ways of life. In fact, until fairly recently,most children had been expected to set out in search of strangecrossroads--and cross them--and find magical implements--and wieldthem--and encounter strange people with strange ways; all this, with theobject of returning to the valley and preparing it for the next generationof children, who would in due time emerge thoroughly unprepared andperfectly ready.These days, the valley was in constant contact with othervalleys, and the valleys learned from one another at an ever increasingmatch, and the magical implements were more or less owned by bigconglomerates. All this being so, Edgar and Gareth decided that the bestway to prepare themselves was to do themselves what the valleys weredoing, and so learned the artful science of learning and communicating.They learned it so well that they found an old weaver, a holdover from anearlier time, one now content to weave his sacks into pillows and hisblankets into sacks, and combining their skills, they reminded him of theskill and inspiration which once had been his; and, so inspired, he wovefor them one magical sack apiece. One sack, if torn, would automaticallyrepair itself; the other could hold an object only so long, but wouldtransform any object placed within it. Edgar chose the first sack, andGareth chose the second.Impatient to finally leave the valley, the two set off for thenearest crossroads, found one, shook hands, and separated to follow theroad’s two forks.Edgar found many fruit alongside the road he took, and he tookto stopping and cramming into his sack as many fruit as he could find.After all, he reasoned, if his sack tore, it would repair itself; he was"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14pushing his sack to its logical extreme, and therefore, making the bestpossible use of it.Gareth also found many fruit alongside his road. He gatheredsome, then, remembering the weaver’s not very precise description of hissack’s qualities, found himself pausing often to inspect the things he’dcollected.Edgar found that nothing in his life could compare to thepleasure of grabbing as many fruit as he could; he was young, his sackwas large, the world was a place of many valleys--life was going to befun indeed.Gareth found that it helped to be careful about what he put in hissack. Fruits that were flawed when he put them in were often thoroughlyrotten when he took them out; on the other hand, things that had seemedworthwhile at first became, later, remarkably so, and in surprising ways:What was once merely a particularly shiny apple emerged later with astem of gold. Sometimes the fruits and nuts and little toys he collectedturned out to be not objects at all but squirrels and foxes and birds andeven people. Gareth became fairly mellow about the process; when asquirrel popped out of his sack, he led it to a tree; when a bird poppedout, he tossed it into flight. Eventually he was even nonchalant on thoseoccasions when a young girl popped out of the sack, figuring that she’dmeet lots of girlfriends in the towns ahead and would tell all of her newfriends of the magical and fascinating person now approaching.Edgar had by this point filled and broken his bag many times.The first time it tore, he thought, It’s tough to keep what I want, so themost important thing is getting what I want as fast as I can get it, beforemy bag breaks. Damn thing is pretty unpredictable.The remarkable thing is that Edgar had the same thought eachtime his bag broke; and since he was collecting things faster and faster,his bag was tearing and spilling more and more often. No matter,though--Edgar would just try harder and gather things faster.Since Gareth’s sack could only hold so much and would not ofitself stitch back together if torn, Gareth had not only to choose carefullywhat to put in his sack but to start giving things away and trading thingswith those whom he met. He began to acquire a degree of fame, and sohad the finest things in every valley routinely offered him. People tookpleasure in knowing that things once in their care were now travelingwith one surrounded by such an aura.Edgar found that those whom he passed had started to notice hishabit of gathering every thing he found and stuffing it in his sack."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15Sometimes they were around when it tore and spilled and patched itself;word of this process and of his practices seemed to reach towns before hedid, and he began traveling at night and through difficult terrain so as toavoid the villagers’ curious eyes.Since Gareth found that everything that he liked was, in oneform or another, perpetually being offered him no matter where he went,he began to think of entire villages as being like magical sacks; then herealized that this equally applied to whole valleys; and probably to thewhole vast world itself, though perhaps not to big conglomerates.Edgar began to find living in caves useful.It occurred to Gareth that, in one way or another, anything couldbe usefully compared to anything else, so long as the comparison teachessomething.Caves, Edgar noticed, were filled with bugs. And a great manybugs could be stuffed into a single sack. And if they were not preciselydelicious, at least they didn’t look at him funny when he ate them. Every individual, Gareth decided, was best thought of as amagical sack. Being a magical sack himself, he let his old sack now betaken by the wind.This magical sack finally blew into Edgar’s cave. Edgar lookedup and noticed the cloth interloper; though initally hesitant--he was veryconcerned about his ability to digest cloth--he eventually stuffed the newsack into his old bulging sack. He heard the familiar sound of seamsripping, and was gratified. After all, he was Edgar, He Who Lives inCaves, Frightens Children, and Makes Cloth Rip.Gareth resolved to lend himself out as someone else’s magicalsack, and went out to find an old weaver.Maybe this story stops right here. Maybe Gareth actually getssidetracked, and winds up focusing on how the Mets are doing this year;maybe he satisfies himself with sitting on the couch and watchinginfomercials. Maybe Edgar sticks to his diet of bugs. On the other hand,perhaps your mind’s eye sees one or both of the brothers taking a bolder,further step. Again, I don’t know, because Edgar and Gareth are insideyour mind now, and you have to supply the next step yourself.If you want there to be another chapter, you’ll have to be theone to create it and live it.For the tools to do this—to get hold of Sexual Key and GutImpact--you might want to visit www.sexualkey.com."}]
