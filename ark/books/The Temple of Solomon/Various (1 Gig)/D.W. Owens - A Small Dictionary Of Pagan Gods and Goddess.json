There is no pretense of original or exhaustiveresearch here.The information isdrawn from popular books and standard reference works such as can be found inanylibrary.There have been manythousands of pagan deities, of course, and a truly complete listing of them isprobably impossible.This littlelisting of only a a few hundred gods does not pretend to be any more than arandom sampling of the riches of the pagan religious genius.Many will disagree with my choices -- why this god and not that one?Why was this pantheon ignored altogether?The answer is that the choices are almost completely arbitrary, beingthose gods I thought important or interesting enough to make a note of.I remind the reader that this is a little piece done in spare moments,and not a major scholarly work. One caveat.Sourcessometimes disagree with each other, and the pagan pantheons were quite fluid,changing all the time.One godwould split into several, or several gods would merge into one, and often onegod was considered an aspect or form of another god.The pagans borrowed deities from each other quite freely, and the variouscults went in and out of fashion much the same way that rock groups go in andout of fashion in our own day.Withthat explanation (or excuse), I accept all blame for any truly glaring errors. Blessed be.
