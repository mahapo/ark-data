[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"I - Magical Objection Mastery By Kenrick E. Cleveland Exposing and using the 24 doorways into the mind to Obliterate any objection at will"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The patterns Deframing - applying Meta-Model distinctions to uncover and challenge to the structure or representation of a belief. 1. Chunking down - How, what when, who specifically. Break it into smaller parts. 2. Reality strategy - How do you know? What do you (V, A, K) to represent that in your mind? (Then attack that.) Content Reframing - challenging parts of the belief's content by redefining them, providing counter-examples, or applying the belief or content against themselves. 3. Redefine the external behavior - (External behavior or event) doesn't cause/equal (stated feelings/thoughts), 0 causes/equals (your new definition). 4. Redefine the internal state - Your (emotion) isn't caused by (event or cause), it's caused by (some other event). 5. Reflexively apply EB to self/listener - (Turn the external event back at the person.) 6. Reflexively apply IS to self/listener - (Turn the internal state back at the person.) 7. Reverse presuppositions pattern - (The stated cause) doesn't actually cause (what they said), it causes (the opposite). 8. Counter example - Do you know any examples where X caused something other than Y? Do you know any examples where something other than X caused Y? (What objection was), but perhaps you're forgetting (counter example). How can you say (objection) when (counter example). 9. Intention of EB - (External behavior or event) is actually (invent a plausible intention for it that suits your needs). 10. Cause of ES - (External behavior) is because (invent a plausible cause for it that suits your needs). Pre-framing - altering an earlier meaning, intention, or cause to get what you want. Making up or manipulating a context in the past which frames the belief in such a way as to cause the person to change it per your suggestion. This category doesn't usually work by itself. Combine it with others. (You can use it as a powerful pace, prior to blowing up their belief.) 11. Manipulate the prior intention - You have that belief so that you can (invent a purpose or intention for the belief which you can leverage). 12. Manipulate the prior cause - You have that belief because (make up previous events which caused the belief and can be used as leverage). Alternate Futures - Describing an alternate future that changes the belief or objection. Finding a context in the future in which the belief doesn't make sense or is insignificant, or the belief's consequences are undesirable. Talking from the position of now, where the future changes the now. This pattern is GREAT for eliminating objections before they arise. Also, you can use this pattern to \"pace and lead\" (going more global with each step) the outcome of your choice. 13. Immediate or short-term consequence - (Paint a picture of the immediate effect of the EB=IS belief.) 14. Outcome of outcome - (The short term consequence) will lead to (additional longer term consequences.) 15. Eternity - (Talk about now from the distant future, usually in global terms.) Bigger Picture - Finding a larger context to think about the belief that provides a natural environment for the belief to change. This pattern doesn't usually work well by itself. Combine with pre-framing. 16. Model of the world - That's an interesting model of the world! (To combine with pre-framing, say, \"Here's why you have it.\")"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"17. Criteria/values - (Pick one of their criteria or values and show them how their belief prevents them from getting it. Works very well when criteria are extracted from the presuppositions in the belief.) 18. Allness - (Apply to a class of people of events.) If all (consumers, people, etc.) believed that... 19. Time - For how long? When does this belief not make sense? (Sometimes, this works on its own) 20. Have to/modal operators - (Restate their modal operator and suggest a different one. Have to => must, etc.) 21. Equality - (Challenge the idea that the EB and the IS are the same thing. Assert that they are different.) 22. Ecology - (This pattern is a combination of the Alternate Futures category and the criteria pattern above. Challenge that the belief or objection has undesirable consequences.) Believing that... or The consequences of that... or With that kind of negativity... 23. Huge global misconceptions - Do you always (connect belief or objection with huge global statement.)? Metaphor - Telling a story, possibly seemingly unrelated, which somehow correlates to the belief or situation, and provides alternative viewpoints and options which help the unconscious mind to make the associations it needs to change limiting beliefs and become unstuck. 24. Metaphor/story - Align the story so it's isomorphic in structure to the situation you are changing via the metaphor. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The objections 1. Cancer causes death. 2.

If those laws weren't in place, then they wouldn't be broken!\" 5. \"Now there's a poverty mindset if I ever saw one. Where did you get such an impoverished model of the way the world works?\" 6. \"Why, that kind of belief in itself is almost criminal. How dare you stereotype the weak, poor, and homeless as criminals?\" 7. \"Now that you really think about it, it makes sense that those who live in poverty need the system to help and protect them, and so would never want to commit crimes against it, doesn't it?\" 8. \"Have you ever stolen anything? You're not poor, are you? White-collar crime is on the rise these days. Some executives are embezzling millions of dollars from their corporations! What about the author of the Harry Potter books? Did you know that she was a starving author until she got her big break?\" 9. \"Poverty is really a signal of tremendous technological growth. The people who end up jobless and poor simply can't keep up with the changing times!\" 10. “I always thought crime was caused by a profound motivation to really get ahead in life, with just one thing missing - the knowledge of how to do it legally!\" 11. \"What a great way you've found to motivate yourself to stay above the poverty line. Wouldn't you rather strive for prosperity instead? What do we need to do together in order to help you become wealthy?\" 12. \"I'm very glad you pay so much attention to politics. Let's visit a Boys and Girls club and see where people like you do get to make a difference.\" 13. \"With an attitude like that, you're going to treat all people in need of your help like criminals. How many of them do you think you'll help turn to crime?\" 14. \"You know, the more you believe that crazy idea of how the world works, the more anxiety you'll feel about becoming poor and turning to crime. And everyone knows that the more you focus on something, the more likely it'll happen. Wouldn't you rather turn your attention to helping those in poverty gain the skills necessary to make it on their own?\" 15. \"You know, a few hundred years from now, your great great grandchildren might be researching their family tree, and they might see you as 'the bum in our family who died penniless in a prison cell.' Wouldn't you rather them remember you as the generous uncle their grandparents always talked about who came up with some spectacular idea and made millions on it?\" 16. \"That's an interesting belief you have. Studies actually show that only X% of criminals are living below the poverty line.\" 17. \"Do you feel that belief makes your view of the world richer? Or does it make you feel down in the dumps?\" 18. If everyone believed that, all the homeless people you don’t see would be ransacking your house instead of living in shelters and trying to find jobs. 19. \"Was it always this way? Will it always be this way? Even after we eliminate poverty?\" 20. \"Must poverty always cause crime? What would you think if you saw a homeless man win the lottery with his last dollar? What would you say if I told you that my family lived on welfare for several weeks after coming to the US, without a penny to our names, before my parents got jobs? And that now my family's income is almost in the 6-digit range, just a few years later?\""},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"21. \"The idea that poverty is a crime went out with debt prisons.

Do you think it alienates you from people you might otherwise learn a lot from?\" 23. \"So the amount of money a person at a moment in time determines his morals and willingness to follow laws?

I seem to remember something about Bill Gates, questionable business practices, and an anti-trust lawsuit.\" 24. \"My good friend Richard Dennis had been driving a bus for years without enough money to make ends meet. His son was extremely sick. Then, when he and I became acquainted, I taught him a little about psychology and persuasion. He went on to find a way to restore his son's health, and become an amazing salesman of nutritional products, single-handedly building a huge company.\" 3. You don't need to know persuasion to be a good salesperson. You just need to be good at closing. 1. \"Which salesmen that you know are extremely successful know nothing of persuasion besides closing?\" 2. \"What in your life experience has convinced you that salesmen don't need to know persuasion, only how to close?\" 3. \"If all you have is a high pressure close, you'll be your client's enemy, and get nothing but buyers' remorse in the end.\" 4. \"A smooth close only happens at the end of a sale where the client is persuaded that making a purchase is in his best interest.\" 5. \"Who persuaded you that you only need to be good at closing to be a successful salesman?\" 6. \"Whoever sold you on that belief must be very persuasive!\" 7. \"Have you ever worked with the top salesperson in your company and noticed how when she sells, she makes everything build up to a smooth, easy close? Now that's persuasion at its best!\" 8. \"I tried to test that theory a few years ago. I took all the best closes I've seen people use, and tried to use just those closes to sell memberships in my club. The few sales I did have canceled their memberships after just a month. When I went back to using criteria, binds, time-release suggestions, and all of the other techniques I know, my close rate shot right back up and most of the clients I've sold are still active members.\" 9. \"When a salesman pulls off a great close, it's usually because of the skill with which he persuaded the client throughout the sale.\" 10. \"People buy things when those things give them something that they're looking for. While a good close is hit-or-miss, a master of persuasion knows how to find out what someone wants, and sell it to them.\" 11. \"That belief is a wonderful way to keep yourself from the sometimes difficult work of learning persuasion. And following that thought, think of how much easier each sale will be when you can use the persuasion techniques we teach to focus in on exactly what will sell a person, and inoculate against any objections or buyer's remorse!\" 12. \"It's great that you've had the chance to study some great closers and begin to emulate their success. Now, why don't you step up a level and watch some of my students do their magic and see what you can learn from them!\" 13. \"If closing is all you think it takes to be good at sales, you'll experience a very rude awakening after a few days of real life experience selling.\" 14. \"That belief won't get you very far in sales. In fact, after failing in sales, most people get depressed because they think they have no social skills. That leads them to become failures at everything else they try. Now, wouldn't you rather learn how to persuade?\" 15. \"After you've retired, would you like to be seen by your successors in the company as someone who was a 'great closer', or as an amazing salesman who created a relationship with each client and revolutionized the way the company does business?\""},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"16. \"Funny that you see it that way. Most salespeople I know tell me that the most important part of the sale is building the initial rapport and credibility. The best ones I know also say that it's real important to know what the client wants and give it to him.\" 17. \"Do you think that belief will really help you learn to become a better salesman?\" 18. \"There was a time when most sales were just high pressure closes. That's the reason so many people have a negative view of sales. Today, when good salespeople sell, their clients don't feel 'sold,' they feel like they are doing what's in their best interest.\" 19. \"This used to be true in the heyday of the Dale Carnegie sales courses. Things have changed, in case you haven't noticed.\" 20. \"So being good at persuasion can't ever be the reason a salesperson is successful? What would happen if someone sold you a product without any kind of close? Would you feel sold, or would you feel that you're doing exactly what's in your best interest?\" 21. \"Since sales is just being a good closer, I guess learning the closing techniques you've learned has made you into such a good salesman you can't get any better.\" 22. \"Is that kind of belief useful? How often do you limit the breadth and depth of your learning like that?\" 23. \"Do you usually restrict being good at something as the result of knowing how to do only one skill? Is driving a car only dependent on being able to press the gas and brake pedals?\" 24. \"I remember driver's ed back in high school. I was in the car with a friend of mine who was so focused on the stop signs and stoplights that he forgot to steer. He would look at the stoplight ahead from several hundred feet away and hold his arms rigid on the steering wheel. All that changed after he was leaning to the right a little once, and almost ran the car next to us off the road. He learned to pay attention to all aspects of driving the car.\" 4.

How overrated is it? How would you rate it so it wouldn't be overrated? How do you know it's not underrated?\" 3. \"Persuasion isn't vital only in presenting a case. Attorneys also need to persuade their clients to hire them. An attorney can't be successful without clients!\" 4. \"Granted, a very good knowledge of law and precedent is necessary for success as an attorney. Still, a lawyer can't be successful without persuasion skills. He would end up as a college professor!\" 5. \"That argument wouldn't persuade me to hire you as an attorney, that's for sure!\" 6. \"When you become a successful attorney, tell me that persuasion skills had very little to do with getting there.\" 7. \"Besides persuading judges and juries that their argument is valid, persuading their clients to hire them, and persuading themselves to be congruent in the courtroom, can't you find anywhere else that attorneys use persuasion to achieve success?\" 8. \"All the successful attorneys I can think of have persuaded me of their competence and success. The more you think of any successful attorneys, the more persuasion you'll notice them using. After all, they persuaded you that they're successful, didn't they?\" 9. \"A lot of successful attorneys didn't learn persuasion skills formally. Instead, they found that their people skills gave them an amazing advantage over their colleagues and rivals. Now imagine how successful they'd be if they had a precise, workable system to increase their charisma and persuasion abilities!\" 10. \"Most attorneys who don't have powerful persuasion skills spent a lot of their time in intense study, learning everything they could about the laws relating to their field of practice. We've expended the same intense effort in developing an easy-to-learn, workable system of persuasion, because attorneys like you didn't have the time. Now you can have the best of both worlds.\" 11. \"That belief has worked very well to motivate you to study law intensely to become the best attorney you can be, hasn't it?

How would you influence the interpretation of the Constitution and related precedents without persuasion skills?\" 13. \"A lot of attorneys I have taught came to me after watching potential clients, one after another, hire other attorneys because they couldn't convince the potential clients to hire them.\" 14. \"If you keep cutting skills you don't think you need out of your life, how stagnant do you think your life will become? Without expanding your skills and learning new things, you'll begin to fail first professionally, then in your personal life, and it'll just get worse from there.\" 15. \"In the end, when your colleagues think of you, do you want them to remember you as a bookworm who knew the law better than anyone else and made sure they knew that, or as a lawyer who knew how to keep clients happy, whom clients raved about, and who had a charisma and presence in the courtroom that swayed judges and juries to his point of view?\" 16. \"It's fascinating what you do and don't think of as important to your success as an attorney. I know several more experienced attorneys who would argue that point with you. Where'd you learn to attach so little importance to persuasion?\" 17. \"Do you find that beliefs which cause you to limit yourself from learning skills enhance your success?\" 18. \"If all attorneys believed that, we'd never have any precedents. Who would convince the courts of the validity of one argument or another in a highly controversial situation?\" 19. \"When did the ability to persuade judges and juries to view a case or the law in a certain way become outdated?\" 20. \"Is it possible to overrate an essential part of something? If persuasion wasn't necessary to success as an attorney, how many attorneys would you see on TV and in the yellow pages advertising their services and trying to persuade clients to hire them?\" 21, \"On the contrary, being an attorney is all about persuasion! Not only is getting clients persuasion, but everything you do in the courtroom is persuasion.\" 22. \"Does it serve you well to avoid learning required skills? Did you fail any tests in school when you thought something wasn't going to be on a test, and then it was?\" 23. \"How often do you leave out important parts of things? Do you ever decide that you don't need flour in a cake? Do you think that would turn out good?\" 24. \"There's a Russian fairy tale about a boy who finds a jinni in a bottle. The jinni takes a liking to the boy for freeing him. One day as they're walking along a sidewalk, the boy points out a gold watch and says 'I wish I had one.' The jinni makes him a watch, and the boy puts it on, noticing how heavy it is. It turns out that the jinni made the watch of solid gold, so it didn't work! The framework was there - but the inner workings weren't. It's the same way with persuasion and law. You can know all there is to know about law, but if you can't persuade people to take your point of view, you won't get anywhere.\" 5.

I work with many people whose experience is quite the opposite of what you imagine it is. The difference between you and them is attitude, and having had someone like me guide them in their first steps. Wouldn't you like to try again from the beginning?\" 17. \"Aren't you, right now, risking that you might never really make as much as you want, and do what you really want in life? Doesn't that burn?\" 18. \"If everyone believed that, people who are highly successful in MLM, like me, wouldn't exist.

'What would happen if you joined this MLM with me, and didn't get burned, but instead, got some very nice profits for doing work you really enjoyed doing? Would you attribute it to having me as a guide and teacher, or to the experiences you've already had with MLM?\" 21. \"If MLMs were really the same thing as getting burned, do you think such a significant percentage of the US population would be involved with them?\" 22. \"How useful is it to let isolated previous experiences limit you from a whole class of opportunities?\" 23. \"Do you always generalize bad experiences from isolated circumstances to something much more global that quickly?\" 24. “I remember one time, not long before I got my black belt in karate, our karate school had a little sparring tournament. There were two teams, and at the end, we were tied. The tiebreaker fight ended up being one of my friends against me, a three-point fight. When I scored the second point on him with a punch, he blocked a little slow, and brought his whole arm down on top of my thumb. I didn't realize it, but that broke it. We kept fighting, and I won the match, but for weeks the doctor wouldn't let me spar again, until my thumb healed.

In fact, they'll all look at you through eyes of distrust, and you'll be able to feel it. It'll eventually wear you down to the point where you won't be able to sell ever again. So if I were you, I'd focus on getting customers what they want and need so they can feel comfortable purchasing from you. For example, I need time to think about it.

But it's more important to me to make sure I don't miss out on other opportunities I'm considering, and even more important that I don't miss out on making sure that this decision is right for my family and me. I guess it all depends on the interpretation of missing out.\" 17. \"How often do you completely miss out on sales by pressuring your potential customers and pushing them too hard to make a decision?

I put lots of pressure on myself every time I tried to make a sale, because I knew if I didn't make the sale, someone would be missing all of the benefits I saw in my product. One day my manager called me into his office and said 'Jim, some of your customers are complaining about how much pressure you put on them when you sell them.'

Our family needs a house of that quality, and you're haggling about a few thousand dollars that will only end up increasing our mortgage by less than fifty dollars a month!\" 7. \"That doesn't make sense at all. The fact that they want to sell the house is the very reason that they won't lower the price on it!\" 8. \"My secretary's best friend at work was selling her house, and instead of lowering the price she used a different real estate agent, who told her to raise the price and brought in an affluent couple to look at the house.

It all comes down to whether you want this house, or whether we need to start looking for less expensive houses for you.\" 17. \"Does that belief often save you money?

That sure explains the dismal direction our country's social, political, and legal systems have been heading in!\" 21. \"If youth and inexperience means being qualified for office, then maybe my ten year old grandson should be running for President.\" 22. \"Have you found that it helps your political career to attack other candidates' advantages instead of focusing on the issues?

Instead of calling me names, why don't you tell me about your day? It helps to vent.\" 13. \"Calling people names like that sure won't win you many friends. You'll alienate most of the ones you have in a real short while if you haven't already.\" 14. \"You're going to alienate all your friends like that, and then you'll be alone and depressed, and the more depressed you become the angrier you'll be at the people around you.

Maybe you see all the things that are going well for you, and feel empowered to change all the things that aren't going so well, but still feel desperate, like you're really missing something vital in your life but can't get it? Do you notice how much that desperate feeling grows with every moment that you don't accept Jesus into your life?\" 14. \"The sense of emptiness that you feel inside, because you haven't let Jesus in your heart to fill that void, will keep expanding to the point where you'll believe it perfectly fine to hate, to commit crimes and to commit awful sins.

I don't know why you'd have so little respect for devout Christians like me. I guess you might've had a bad experience with another Christian who tried to convert you and didn't realize that everyone has his or her own style of worship. Because I respect personal styles, and know that the only thing that really matters is accepting Jesus into your heart as your guide and savior, people find me very refreshing, easy to talk to, and convincing.\" 17. \"Does bashing Christians really make good use of your time?\" 18. \"If everyone was as closed minded as you, and closed off their heart to the love of Jesus, none of us would be alive today because the human race would destroy itself.

One of my friends used to laugh at me because I am such a devout Christian. I do everything I do because I love God. Two years ago he suffered a heart attack, and as he was rushed to the hospital, he found himself being pulled out of his body and to a place that is indescribable. Jesus spoke to him, and showed him heaven and hell. Jesus said that he would be given a second chance to live, and told him to rethink his life's purpose.

In fact, that's exactly why I gave you the advice I did - to make sure you don't get screwed over.\" 12. \"Have you been burned or cheated by another attorney?

So I see how you could misinterpret it as being old-fashioned. But don't you think I might have a reason other than being afraid to change? I do things the way I do them because I know that way has worked for decades, and is likely to keep on working.\" 13. \"Pay attention to the way I do things, or you'll just end up reinventing the wheel.\" 14. \"If you don't pay attention to established methods, you're going to waste a lot of time reinventing the wheel. Think of how far you can go in life if you start by learning what we already know so you don't have to rediscover it. That way you have a jumping off point to start innovating from.\" 15. \"When you've passed on, do you want your colleagues and family to remember you as another rebel who ended up wasting his time reinventing the wheel? Or would you rather be remembered for taking what is available already and innovating and improving on it, and really making a difference by, as Isaac Newton said, standing on the shoulders of giants?\" 16. \"People your age so often think of people my age as old-fashioned. Ask anyone that's my age; we do things the way we do them because in our experience that way of doing things works, not because we don't know how to change with the times. We are the people whose experience today's innovations are based on.\" 17. \"Does starting from ground zero and ignoring what's already known really help you to innovate?\" 18. \"We'd probably still be in caves if everyone disregarded past experience. Every generation would literally reinvent the wheel.\" 19, \"How long will you continue trying to reinvent the wheel before you realize that the right way to innovate is to start with what we already know?\" 20. \"I have to manage the business this way because I'm old fashioned? What would happen if you started from scratch and spent thirty years organizing a business, continually rearranging it to make it better, and tweaking it until you found a model that really work? I know. You'd end up with a business much like mine.\" 21. \"Since doing what works makes you old fashioned and obsolete, I assume your suggestion is to throw out everything we know how to do and start all over? That sounds like big progress to me!\" 22. \"Do you find you're more successful by accusing people of doing something wrong instead of analyzing how and why they do it, especially if it works for them?\" 23. \"How common is it for you to accuse people of being something instead of learning from them?\" 24. \"One of my friends wanted to major in computer science. He bought himself a top of the line computer in high school, and set to work learning how to use it. By the time he figured out how to use the basic software that came with it, in a few months, new versions of some of the programs came out, and faster processors came out. Of course, he believed that his computer and software were now obsolete, so he bought a new processor and installed the new versions of the programs. This went on for about a year until he was broke from buying newer and 'more"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"powerful' things without even really knowing what to do with them. The secret is to figure out how and why things work first, and then determine what's required, what will work and what won't.\" 27. I want a raise. 1. \"How much of a raise? For doing what?\" 2. \"What do you think of when you think of wanting a raise? What do you see, or hear, or feel? How do you evaluate that in your mind?\" 3. “I made you responsible for more interesting and challenging projects to test whether you deserve a promotion and raise, and to make you think so that you would never be bored. It's not a signal that I'm ready to give you a raise now.\" 4. “I can't give you a raise for being in charge of the projects for only two months. I can only give you one when you're promoted, and it will take a few more months before you reach that level of experience.\" 5. \"It's very difficult to try to get a raise approved for you at this point. You've only been working in your new capacity for a couple of months.\" 6. “I know how you feel. I wish I were paid more too, with everything I have to do. I have to direct this entire department, write the project proposals, take care of the personnel needs like salary and benefits, follow up on projects, and in general direct this department. Unfortunately, we just can't give you a raise at this point.\" 7. “I just gave you a new, high-tech, challenging project to do so that you grow and learn and gain some essential experience that will take you very far in your field. You need to appreciate this opportunity. Once you're a bit more experienced here, we'll talk about a raise.\" 8. \"You already make more than most of your coworkers who have a similar level of responsibility, and you've only been at your level for a couple of months.\" 9. \"I put you in charge of some very important, challenging high-tech projects. I want you to show me that you can handle that kind of responsibility and have the technical knowledge and learning ability to handle the technical aspects of the project. After you've passed the test, you'll get a full-blown promotion and raise.\" 10. “I gave you more responsibility because you indicated that you believe you're ready for it. When you've proven yourself in successfully completing the projects you've been assigned, you'll be up for a promotion and raise.\" 11. “I know you want more money so that you can live more comfortably, do more of what you want and give your family more of what they want. Just think of this company like a family. We have to stick to a budget too. Right now, the money it would take to give you a raise is tied up elsewhere.\" 12. \"You've gotten a lot more responsibility recently so I see why you might think it's time you got a raise. Actually, I gave you more responsibility to give you a chance to prove yourself capable of working at this level and gain some experience so that we can give you a full promotion and raise when we have the budget to promote someone. Rest assured, the next person to get a raise will be you.\" 13. \"If you ask for a raise or a promotion as often as you do for much longer, I'll give it to you, and give you so much responsibility you won't be able to handle it. Both your skills and the budget to pay you for them take time to develop.\" 14. \"Keep asking and I'll give you a raise and a lot more responsibility than you I be able to handle. Then, when you screw up, you're out. Imagine what that'll do to your family. First you won't have time for them with all the work you'll have, and then you won't have any money to support them with. Maybe it would be better for you to take your time and expand your skills and gain some experience first, so that we can gradually promote you and increase your pay.\" 15. \"After you've retired, how do you want your coworkers to see you end up? As a greedy bum who cared about nothing but getting more money, or as a hard working individual who took his time, gained the necessary experience, and ended up in a very prominent position and getting paid a lot, with a pension plan that ensures a very comfortable retirement?\" 16. “I can see why you might think it's time for you to get a raise - after all, I did just start putting you in charge of more sophisticated projects than you're used to. Upper management, however,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"believes that you need to gain some experience and prove yourself with these projects before they're ready to approve a raise for you.\" 17. \"Do you think you'll end up making more money by wanting it and asking for it? Or do you think that maybe you have to do more to make more?\" 18. \"If every employee in this company asked for a raise as often as you do, the company would be bankrupt within a year. Especially if they had as little experience as you in their positions. Once you prove that you can handle the technical aspects and additional responsibility of your new duties, you'll get a raise.\" 19. \"You've only been in charge of projects at this level for two months. How long do you think you need to prove yourself and gain enough experience to warrant a full promotion and raise?\" 20. \"Just because I put you in charge of a couple of challenging high-tech projects two months ago, I have to give you a raise now? On the contrary, starting with those projects is only the first step you're taking toward a promotion and raise.\" 21. \"If having to do slightly more challenging work automatically means it's time for a raise, I should go talk to upper management about getting a raise for having to deal with you asking for a raise after only two months working on the level of projects you're in charge of now.\" 22. \"Will it work better for you to just ask for a raise, or prove that you can handle the level of projects that you were recently put in charge of and gain some experience to back up your deservingness for a raise? What do you think?\" 23. \"Do you usually complain and ask for money instead of working to demonstrate that you deserve and are worth it?\" 24. \"One day, millions of years ago, a piece of coal worked its way up through the layers of the earth into fresh air. It noticed all the other rocks around it, the multi-colored granite, the rose-colored quartz, the amethyst, and thought 'l am plain and black. Yet, just as these stones, I have made my way up to the top of the soil. Why am I not beautifully colored?' And the coal continued to try to change color. For millions and millions of years it kept trying, as more and more stuff piled up on top of it. Today, that piece of coal is the diamond in the engagement ring you gave your wife when you asked her to marry you. "}]
