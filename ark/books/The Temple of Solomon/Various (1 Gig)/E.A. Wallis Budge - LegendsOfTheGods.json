Wallis BudgeLondon, 1912[Editorial note: Throughout the text “####” represents images which cannot be transcribed.]PREFACE.The welcome which has been accorded to the volumes of this Series, and the fact that some of them havepassed into second and third editions, suggest that these little books have been found useful by beginners inEgyptology and others. Hitherto the object of them has been to supply information about the Religion, Magic,Language, and History of the ancient Egyptians, and to provide editions of the original texts from which suchinformation was derived. There are, however, many branches of Egyptology which need treatment in a similarLegends Of The Gods1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"manner in this Series, and it has been suggested in many quarters that the time has now arrived when thepublication of a series of groups of texts illustrating Egyptian Literature in general might well be begun.Seeing that nothing is known about the authors of Egyptian works, not even their names, it is impossible towrite a History of Egyptian Literature in the ordinary sense of the word. The only thing to be done is to printthe actual works in the best and most complete form possible, with translations, and then to put them in thehands of the reader and leave them to his judgment.With this object in view, it has been decided to publish in the Series several volumes which shall be devotedto the reproduction in hieroglyphic type of the best and most typical examples of the various kinds ofEgyptian Literature, with English translations, on a much larger scale than was possible in my “First Steps inEgyptian” or in my “Egyptian Reading Book.” These volumes are intended to serve a double purpose, i.e., tosupply the beginner in Egyptian with new material and a series of reading books, and to provide the generalreader with translations of Egyptian works in a handy form.The Egyptian texts, whether the originals be written in hieroglyphic or hieratic characters, are here printed inhieroglyphic type, and are arranged with English translations, page for page. They are printed as they arewritten in the original documents, i.e., the words are not divided. The beginner will find the practice ofdividing the words for himself most useful in acquiring facility of reading and understanding the language.The translations are as literal as can reasonably be expected, and, as a whole, I believe that they mean whatthe original writers intended to say. In the case of passages where the text is corrupt, and readings are mixed,or where very rare words occur, or where words are omitted, the renderings given claim to be nothing morethan suggestions as to their meanings. It must be remembered that the exact meanings of many Egyptianwords have still to be ascertained, and that the ancient Egyptian scribes were as much puzzled as we are bysome of the texts which they copied, and that owing to carelessness, ignorance, or weariness, or all three, theymade blunders which the modern student is unable to correct. In the Introduction will be found briefdescriptions of the contents of the Egyptian texts, in which their general bearing and importance are indicated,and references given to authoritative editions of texts and translations.E. A. WALLIS BUDGE.BRITISH MUSEUM, November 17,1911.I. THE LEGEND OF THE GOD NEB−ER−TCHER, AND THE HISTORY OFCREATION.The text of the remarkable Legend of the Creation which forms the first section of this volume is preserved ina well−written papyrus in the British Museum, where it bears the number 10,188. This papyrus was acquiredby the late Mr. A. H. Rhind in 1861 or 1862, when he was excavating some tombs on the west bank of theNile at Thebes. He did not himself find it in a tomb, but he received it from the British Consul at Luxor,Mustafa Agha, during an interchange of gifts when Mr. Rhind was leaving the country. Mustafa Aghaobtained the papyrus from the famous hiding−place of the Royal Mummies at Der−al−Bahari, with thesituation of which he was well acquainted for many years before it became known to the Egyptian Service ofAntiquities. When Mr. Rhind came to England, the results of his excavations were examined by Dr. Birch,who, recognising the great value of the papyrus, arranged to publish it in a companion volume to Facsimilesof Two Papyri, but the death of Mr. Rhind in 1865 caused the project to fall through. Mr. Rhind's collectionpassed into the hands of Mr. David Bremner, and the papyrus, together with many other antiquities, waspurchased by the Trustees of the British Museum. In 1880 Dr. Birch suggested the publication of the papyrusto Dr. Pleyte, the Director of the Egyptian Museum at Leyden. This savant transcribed and translated somepassages from the Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys, which is the first text in it, and these he published inRecueil de Travaux, Paris, tom. iii., pp. 57−64. In 1886 by Dr. Birch's kindness I was allowed to work at theLegends Of The GodsI. THE LEGEND OF THE GOD NEB−ER−TCHER, AND THE HISTORY OF CREATION.2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"papyrus, and I published transcripts of some important passages and the account of the Creation in theProceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, 1886−7, pp. 11−26. The Legend of the Creation wasconsidered by Dr. H. Brugsch to be of considerable value for the study of the Egyptian Religion, andencouraged by him[FN#1] I made a full transcript of the papyrus, which was published in Archaeologia, (vol.lii., London, 1891), with transliterations and translations. In 1910 I edited for the Trustees of the BritishMuseum the complete hieratic text with a revised translation.[FN#2][FN#1] Ein in moglichst wortgetreuer Uebersetzung vorglegter Papyrus− text soll den Schlussstein meinesWerkes bilden. Er wird den Beweis fur die Richtigkeit meiner eigenen Untersuchungen vollenden, indem erdas wichtigste Zeugniss altagyptischen Ursprungs den zahlreichen, von mir angezogenen Stellen aus denInschriften hinzufugt. Trotz mancher Schwierigkeit im Einzelnen ist der Gesammtinhalt des Textes, denzuerst ein englischer Gelehrter der Wissenschaft zuganglich gemacht hat, such nicht im geringstenmisszuverstehen (Brugsch, Religion, p. 740). He gives a German translation of the Creation Legend on pp.740, 741, and a transliteration on p. 756.[FN#2] Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum, London, 1910, folio.The papyrus is about 16 ft. 8 in. in length, and is 9 1/4 in. in width. It contains 21 columns of hieratic textwhich are written in short lines and are poetical in character, and 12 columns or pages of text written in longlines; the total number of lines is between 930 and 940. The text is written in a small, very black, but neathand, and may be assigned to a time between the XXVIth Dynasty and the Ptolemaic Period. The titles,catch−words, rubrics, names of Apep and his fiends, and a few other words, are written in red ink. There aretwo colophons; in the one we have a date, namely, the “first day of the fourth month of the twelfth year ofPharaoh Alexander, the son of Alexander,” i.e., B.C. 311, and in the other the name of the priest who eitherhad the papyrus written, or appropriated it, namely, Nes−Menu, or Nes−Amsu.The Legend of the Creation is found in the third work which is given in the papyrus, and which is called the“Book of overthrowing Apep, the Enemy of Ra, the Enemy of Un−Nefer” (i.e., Osiris). This work contained aseries of spells which were recited during the performance of certain prescribed ceremonies, with the object ofpreventing storms, and dispersing rain−clouds, and removing any obstacle, animate or inanimate, which couldprevent the rising of the sun in the morning, or obscure his light during the day. The Leader−in Chief of thehosts of darkness was a fiend called Apep who appeared in the sky in the form of a monster serpent, and,marshalling all the fiends of the Tuat, attempted to keep the Sun−god imprisoned in the kingdom of darkness.Right in the midst of the spells which were directed against Apep we find inserted the legend of the Creation,which occurs in no other known Egyptian document (Col. XXVI., l. 21, to Col. XXVII., l. 6). Curiouslyenough a longer version of the legend is given a little farther on (Col. XXVIII., l. 20, to Col. XXIX., l. 6).Whether the scribe had two copies to work from, and simply inserted both, or whether he copied the shortversion and added to it as he went along, cannot be said. The legend is entitled: Book of knowing theevolutions of Ra [and of] overthrowing Apep.This curious “Book” describes the origin not only of heaven, and earth, and all therein, but also of GodHimself. In it the name of Apep is not even mentioned, and it is impossible to explain its appearance in theApep Ritual unless we assume that the whole “Book” was regarded as a spell of the most potent character, themere recital of which was fraught with deadly effect for Apep and his friends.The story of the Creation is supposed to be told by the god Neb−er−tcher. This name means the “Lord to theuttermost limit,” and the character of the god suggests that the word “limit” refers to time and space, and thathe was, in fact, the Everlasting God of the Universe. This god's name occurs in Coptic texts, and then heappears as one who possesses all the attributes which are associated by modern nations with God Almighty.Where and how Neb−er−tcher existed is not said, but it seems as if he was believed to have been an almightyand invisible power which filled all space. It seems also that a desire arose in him to create the world, and inLegends Of The GodsI. THE LEGEND OF THE GOD NEB−ER−TCHER, AND THE HISTORY OF CREATION.3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"order to do this he took upon himself the form of the god Khepera, who from first to last was regarded as theCreator, par excellence, among all the gods known to the Egyptians. When this transformation ofNeb−er−tcher into Khepera took place the heavens and the earth had not been created, but there seems to haveexisted a vast mass of water, or world−ocean, called Nu, and it must have been in this that the transformationtook place. In this celestial ocean were the germs of all the living things which afterwards took form in heavenand on earth, but they existed in a state of inertness and helplessness. Out of this ocean Khepera raisedhimself, and so passed from a state of passiveness and inertness into one of activity. When Khepera raisedhimself out of the ocean Nu, he found himself in vast empty space, wherein was nothing on which he couldstand. The second version of the legend says that Khepera gave being to himself by uttering his own name,and the first version states that he made use of words in providing himself with a place on which to stand. Inother words, when Khepera was still a portion of the being of Neb−er−tcher, he spake the word “Khepera,”and Khepera came into being. Similarly, when he needed a place whereon to stand, he uttered the name of thething, or place, on which he wanted to stand, and that thing, or place, came into being. This spell he seems tohave addressed to his heart, or as we should say, will, so that Khepera willed this standing−place to appear,and it did so forthwith. The first version only mentions a heart, but the second also speaks of a heart−soul asassisting Khepera in his first creative acts; and we may assume that he thought out in his heart what manner ofthing be wished to create, and then by uttering its name caused his thought to take concrete form. This processof thinking out the existence of things is expressed in Egyptian by words which mean “laying the foundationin the heart.”In arranging his thoughts and their visible forms Khepera was assisted by the goddess Maat, who is usuallyregarded as the goddess of law, order, and truth, and in late times was held to be the female counterpart ofThoth, “the heart of the god Ra.” In this legend, however, she seems to play the part of Wisdom, as describedin the Book of Proverbs,[FN#3] for it was by Maat that he “laid the foundation.”[FN#3] “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up fromeverlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths I was brought forth . . . . . . .Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: while as yet he had not made the earth,nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared the heavens I was there: whenhe set a compass upon the face of the depth: when he established the clouds above: when he strengthened thefountains of the deep: when he gave to the sea his decree, . . . . . . when he appointed the foundations of theearth: then I was by him, as one brought up with him. . . . . . .” Proverbs, viii. 22 ff.}Having described the coming into being of Khepera and the place on which he stood, the legend goes on totell of the means by which the first Egyptian triad, or trinity, came into existence. Khepera had, in some form,union with his own shadow, and so begot offspring, who proceeded from his body under the forms of the godsShu and Tefnut. According to a tradition preserved in the Pyramid Texts[FN#4] this event took place at On(Heliopolis), and the old form of the legend ascribes the production of Shu and Tefnut to an act ofmasturbation. Originally these gods were the personifications of air and dryness, and liquids respectively; thuswith their creation the materials for the construction of the atmosphere and sky came into being. Shu andTefnut were united, and their offspring were Keb, the Earth−god, and Nut, the Sky−goddess. We have nowfive gods in existence; Khepera, the creative principle, Shu, the atmosphere, Tefnut, the waters above theheavens, Nut, the Sky−goddess, and Keb, the Earth−god. Presumably about this time the sun first rose out ofthe watery abyss of Nu, and shone upon the world and produced day. In early times the sun, or his light, wasregarded as a form of Shu. The gods Keb and Nut were united in an embrace, and the effect of the coming oflight was to separate them. As long as the sun shone, i.e., as long as it was day, Nut, the Sky−goddess,remained in her place above the earth, being supported by Shu; but as soon as the sun set she left the sky andgradually descended until she rested on the body of the Earth−god, Keb.[FN#4] Pepi I., l. 466.Legends Of The GodsI. THE LEGEND OF THE GOD NEB−ER−TCHER, AND THE HISTORY OF CREATION.4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The embraces of Keb caused Nut to bring forth five gods at a birth, namely, Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, andNephthys. Osiris and Isis married before their birth, and Isis brought forth a son called Horus; Set andNephthys also married before their birth, and Nephthys brought forth a son named Anpu (Anubis), though heis not mentioned in the legend. Of these gods Osiris is singled out for special mention in the legend, in whichKhepera, speaking as Neb−er−tcher, says that his name is Ausares, who is the essence of the primeval matterof which he himself is formed. Thus Osiris was of the same substance as the Great God who created the worldaccording to the Egyptians, and was a reincarnation of his great−grandfather. This portion of the legend helpsto explain the views held about Osiris as the great ancestral spirit, who when on earth was a benefactor ofmankind, and who when in heaven was the saviour of souls.The legend speaks of the sun as the Eye of Khepera, or Neb−er−tcher, and refers to some calamity whichbefell it and extinguished its light. This calamity may have been simply the coming of night, or eclipses, orstorms; but in any case the god made a second Eye, i.e., the Moon, to which he gave some of the splendour ofthe other Eye, i.e., the Sun, and he gave it a place in his Face, and henceforth it ruled throughout the earth, andhad special powers in respect of the production of trees, plants, vegetables, herbs, etc. Thus from the earliesttimes the moon was associated with the fertility of the earth, especially in connection with the production ofabundant crops and successful harvests.According to the legend, men and women sprang not from the earth, but directly from the body of the godKhepera, or Neb−er−tcher, who placed his members together and then wept tears upon them, and men andwomen, came into being from the tears which had fallen from his eyes. No special mention is made of thecreation of beasts in the legend, but the god says that he created creeping things of all kinds, and among theseare probably included the larger quadrupeds. The men and women, and all the other living creatures whichwere made at that time, reproduced their species, each in his own way, and so the earth became filled withtheir descendants which we see at the present time.Such is the Legend of Creation as it is found in the Papyrus of Nes−Menu. The text of both versions is full ofdifficult passages, and some readings are corrupt; unfortunately variant versions by which they might becorrected are lacking. The general meaning of the legend in both versions is quite clear, and it throwsconsiderable light on the Egyptian religion. The Egyptians believed in the existence of God, the Creator andMaintainer of all things, but they thought that the concerns of this world were committed by Him to thesuperintendence of a series of subordinate spirits or beings called “gods,” over whom they believed magicalspells and ceremonies to have the greatest influence. The Deity was a Being so remote, and of such an exaltednature, that it was idle to expect Him to interfere in the affairs of mortals, or to change any decree orcommand which He had once uttered. The spirits or “gods,” on the other hand, possessing natures not farremoved from those of men, were thought to be amenable to supplications and flattery, and to wheedling andcajolery, especially when accompanied by gifts. It is of great interest to find a legend in which the power ofGod as the Creator of the world and the sun and moon is so clearly set forth, embedded in a book of magicalspells devoted to the destruction of the mythological monster who existed solely to prevent the sun from risingand shining.II. THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.The text containing the Legend of the Destruction of Mankind is written in hieroglyphs, and is found on thefour walls of a small chamber which is entered from the “hall of columns” in the tomb of Seti I., which issituated on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes. On the wall facing the door of this chamber is painted in redthe figure of the large “Cow of Heaven.” The lower part of her belly is decorated with a series of thirteenstars, and immediately beneath it are the two Boats of Ra, called Semketet and Mantchet, or Sektet and Matet.Each of her four legs is held in position by two gods, and the god Shu, with outstretched uplifted arms,supports her body. The Cow was published by Champollion,[FN#5] without the text. This most importantmythological text was first published and translated by Professor E. Naville in 1874.[FN#6] It wasLegends Of The GodsII.

Arch., vol. viii., p. 412 ft.The legend takes us back to the time when the gods of Egypt went about in the country, and mingled withmen and were thoroughly acquainted with their desires and needs. The king who reigned over Egypt was Ra,the Sun−god, who was not, however, the first of the Dynasty of Gods who ruled the land. His predecessor onthe throne was Hephaistos, who, according to Manetho, reigned 9000 years, whilst Ra reigned only 992 years;Panodorus makes his reign to have lasted less than 100 years. Be this as it may, it seems that the “self−createdand self−begotten” god Ra had been ruling over mankind for a very long time, for his subjects weremurmuring against him, and they were complaining that he was old, that his bones were like silver, his bodylike gold, and his hair like lapis−lazuli. When Ra heard these murmurings he ordered his bodyguard tosummon all the gods who had been with him in the primeval World−ocean, and to bid them privately toassemble in the Great House, which can be no other than the famous temple of Heliopolis. This statement isinteresting, for it proves that the legend is of Heliopolitan origin, like the cult of Ra itself, and that it does notbelong, at least in so far as it applies to Ra, to the Predynastic Period.When Ra entered the Great Temple, the gods made obeisance to him, and took up their positions on each sideof him, and informed him that they awaited his words. Addressing Nu, the personification of the World−ocean, Ra bade them to take notice of the fact that the men and women whom his Eye had created weremurmuring against him. He then asked them to consider the matter and to devise a plan of action for him, forhe was unwilling to slay the rebels without hearing what his gods had to say. In reply the gods advised Ra tosend forth his Eye to destroy the blasphemers, for there was no eye on earth that could resist it, especiallywhen it took the form of the goddess Hathor. Ra accepted their advice and sent forth his Eye in the form ofHathor to destroy them, and, though the rebels had fled to the mountains in fear, the Eye pursued them andovertook them and destroyed them. Hathor rejoiced in her work of destruction, and on her return was praisedby Ra, for what she had done. The slaughter of men began at Suten−henen (Herakleopolis), and during thenight Hathor waded about in the blood of men. Ra asserted his intention of being master of the rebels, and thisLegends Of The GodsII. THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"is probably referred to in the Book of the Dead, Chapter XVII., in which it is said that Ra rose as king for thefirst time in Suten−henen. Osiris also was crowned at Suten−henen, and in this city lived the great Bennu bird,or Phoenix, and the “Crusher of Bones” mentioned in the Negative Confession.The legend now goes on to describe an act of Ra, the significance of which it is difficult to explain. The godordered messengers to be brought to him, and when they arrived, he commanded them to run like the wind toAbu, or the city of Elephantine, and to bring him large quantities of the fruit called tataat. What kind of fruitthis was is not clear, but Brugsch thought they were “mandrakes,” the so−called “love−apples,” and thistranslation of tataat may be used provisionally. The mandrakes were given to Sekti, a goddess of Heliopolis,to crush and grind up, and when this was done they were mixed with human blood, and put in a large brewingof beer which the women slaves had made from wheat. In all they made 7,000 vessels of beer. When Ra sawthe beer he approved of it, and ordered it to be carried up the river to where the goddess Hathor was still, itseems, engaged in slaughtering men. During the night he caused this beer to be poured out into the meadowsof the Four Heavens, and when Hathor came she saw the beer with human blood and mandrakes in it, anddrank of it and became drunk, and paid no further attention to men and women. In welcoming the goddess,Ra, called her “Amit,” i.e., “beautiful one,” and from this time onward “beautiful women were found in thecity of Amit,” which was situated in the Western Delta, near Lake Mareotis.[FN#15] Ra also ordered that infuture at every one of his festivals vessels of “sleep−producing beer” should be made, and that their numbershould be the same as the number of the handmaidens of Ra. Those who took part in these festivals of Hathorand Ra drank beer in very large quantities, and under the influence of the “beautiful women,” i.e., thepriestesses, who were supposed to resemble Hathor in their physical attractions, the festal celebrationsdegenerated into drunken and licentious orgies.[FN#15] It was also called the “City of Apis,” (Brugsch, Dict. Geog., p. 491), and is the Apis city of classicalwriters. It is, perhaps, represented by the modern Kom al−Hisn.Soon after this Ra complained that he was smitten with pain, and that he was weary of the, children of men.He thought them a worthless remnant, and wished that more of them had been slain. The gods about himbegged him to endure, and reminded him that his power was in proportion to his will. Ra was, however,unconsoled, and he complained that his limbs were weak for the first time in his life. Thereupon the god Nutold Shu to help Ra, and he ordered Nut to take the great god Ra on her back. Nut changed herself into a cow,and with the help of Shu Ra got on her back. As soon as men saw that Ra was on the back of the Cow ofHeaven, and was about to leave them, they became filled with fear and repentance, and cried out to Ra toremain with them and to slay all those who had blasphemed against him. But the Cow moved on her way, andcarried Ra to Het−Ahet, a town of the nome of Mareotis, where in later days the right leg of Osiris was said tobe preserved. Meanwhile darkness covered the land. When day broke the men who had repented of theirblasphemies appeared with their bows, and slew the enemies of Ra. At this result Ra was pleased, and heforgave those who had repented because of their righteous slaughter of his enemies. From this time onwardshuman sacrifices were offered up at the festivals of Ra celebrated in this place, and at Heliopolis and in otherparts of Egypt.After these things Ra declared to Nut that he intended to leave this world, and to ascend into heaven, and thatall those who would see his face must follow him thither. Then he went up into heaven and prepared a place towhich all might come. Then he said, “Hetep sekhet aa,” i.e., “Let a great field be produced,” and straightway“Sekhet−hetep,” or the “Field of peace,” came into being. He next said, “Let there be reeds (aaru) in it,” andstraightway “Sekhet Aaru,” or the “Field of Reeds,” came into being. Sekhet−hetep was the Elysian Fields ofthe Egyptians, and the Field of Reeds was a well−known section of it. Another command of the god Raresulted in the creation of the stars, which the legend compares to flowers. Then the goddess Nut trembled inall her body, and Ra, fearing that she might fall, caused to come into being the Four Pillars on which theheavens are supported. Turning to Shu, Ra entreated him to protect these supports, and to place himself underNut, and to hold her up in position with his hands. Thus Shu became the new Sun−god in the place of Ra, andLegends Of The GodsII. THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the heavens in which Ra lived were supported and placed beyond the risk of falling, and mankind would liveand rejoice in the light of the new sun.At this place in the legend a text is inserted called the “Chapter of the Cow.” It describes how the Cow ofHeaven and the two Boats of the Sun shall be painted, and gives the positions of the gods who stand by thelegs of the Cow, and a number of short magical names, or formulae, which are inexplicable. The generalmeaning of the picture of the Cow is quite clear. The Cow represents the sky in which the Boats of Ra, sail,and her four legs are the four cardinal points which cannot be changed. The region above her back is theheaven in which Ra reigns over the beings who pass thereto from this earth when they die, and here wassituated the home of the gods and the celestial spirits who govern this world.When Ra had made a heaven for himself, and had arranged for a continuance of life on the earth, and thewelfare of human beings, he remembered that at one time when reigning on earth he had been bitten by aserpent, and had nearly lost his life through the bite. Fearing that the same calamity might befall his successor,he determined to take steps to destroy the power of all noxious reptiles that dwelt on the earth. With thisobject in view he told Thoth to summon Keb, the Earth−god, to his presence, and this god having arrived, Ratold him that war must be made against the serpents that dwelt in his dominions. He further commanded himto go to the god Nu, and to tell him to set a watch over all the reptiles that were in the earth and in water, andto draw up a writing for every place in which serpents are known to be, containing strict orders that they are tobite, no one. Though these serpents knew that Ra was retiring from the earth, they were never to forget thathis rays would fall upon them. In his place their father Keb was to keep watch over them, and he was theirfather for ever.As a further protection against them Ra promised to impart to magicians and snake−charmers the particularword of power, hekau, with which he guarded himself against the attacks of serpents, and also to transmit it tohis son Osiris. Thus those who are ready to listen to the formulae of the snake−charmers shall always beimmune from the bites of serpents, and their children also. From this we may gather that the profession of thesnake−charmer is very ancient, and that this class of magicians were supposed to owe the foundation of theircraft to a decree of Ra himself.Ra next sent for the god Thoth, and when he came into the presence of Ra, he invited him to go with him to adistance, to a place called “Tuat,” i.e., hell, or the Other World, in which region he had determined to makehis light to shine. When they arrived there he told Thoth, the Scribe of Truth, to write down on his tablets thenames of all who were therein, and to punish those among them who had sinned against him, and he deputedto Thoth the power to deal absolutely as he pleased with all the beings in the Tuat. Ra loathed the wicked, andwished them to be kept at a distance from him. Thoth was to be his vicar, to fill his place, and “Place of Ra,”was to be his name. He gave him power to send out a messenger (hab), so the Ibis (habi) came into being. Allthat Thoth would do would be good (khen), therefore the Tekni bird of Thoth came into being. He gave Thothpower to embrace (anh) the heavens, therefore the Moon−god (Aah) came into being. He gave Thoth power toturn back (anan) the Northern peoples, therefore the dog−headed ape of Thoth came into being. Finally Ratold Thoth that he would take his place in the sight of all those who were wont to worship Ra, and that allshould praise him as God. Thus the abdication of Ra was complete.In the fragmentary texts which follow we are told how a man may benefit by the recital of this legend. Hemust proclaim that the soul which animated Ra was the soul of the Aged One, and that of Shu, Khnemu (?),Heh, &c., and then he must proclaim that he is Ra himself, and his word of power Heka. If he recites theChapter correctly he shall have life in the Other World, and he will be held in greater fear there than here. Arubric adds that he must be dressed in new linen garments, and be well washed with Nile water; he must wearwhite sandals, and his body must be anointed with holy oil. He must burn incense in a censer, and a figure ofMaat (Truth) must be painted on his tongue with green paint. These regulations applied to the laity as well asto the clergy.Legends Of The GodsII. THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"III. THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS.The original text of this very interesting legend is written in the hieratic character on a papyrus preserved atTurin, and was published by Pleyte and Rossi in their Corpus of Turin Papyri.[FN#16] French and Germantranslations of it were published by Lefebure,[FN#17] and Wiedemann[FN#18] respectively, and summariesof its contents were given by Erman[FN#19] and Maspero.[FN#20] A transcript of the hieratic text intohieroglyphics, with transliteration and translation, was published by me in 1895.[FN#21][FN#16] Papyrus de Turin, pll. 31, 77, 131−138.[FN#17] A. Z., 1883, p. 27 ff.[FN#18] Die Religion, p. 29.[FN#19] Aegypten, p. 359 ff.[FN#20] Les Origines, V. 162−4.[FN#21] First Steps in Egyptian, p. 241 ff.It has already been seen that the god Ra, when retiring from the government of this world, took steps throughThoth to supply mankind with words of power and spells with which to protect themselves against the bites ofserpents and other noxious reptiles. The legend of the Destruction of Mankind affords no explanation of thisremarkable fact, but when we read the following legend of Ra and Isis we understand why Ra, though king ofthe gods, was afraid of the reptiles which lived in the kingdom of Keb. The legend, or “Chapter of the DivineGod,” begins by enumerating the mighty attributes of Ra as the creator of the universe, and describes the godof “many names” as unknowable, even by the gods. At this time Isis lived in the form of a woman whopossessed the knowledge of spells and incantations, that is to say, she was regarded much in the same way asmodern African peoples regard their “medicine−women,” or “witch−women.” She had used her spells onmen, and was tired of exercising her powers on them, and she craved the opportunity of making herselfmistress of gods and spirits as well as of men. She meditated how she could make herself mistress both ofheaven and earth, and finally she decided that she could only obtain the power she wanted if she possessed theknowledge of the secret name of Ra, in which his very existence was bound up. Ra guarded this name mostjealously, for he knew that if he revealed it to any being he would henceforth be at that being's mercy. Isis sawthat it was impossible to make Ra declare his name to her by ordinary methods, and she therefore thought outthe following plan. It was well known in Egypt and the Sudan at a very early period that if a magicianobtained some portion of a person's body, e.g., a hair, a paring of a nail, a fragment of skin, or a portion ofsome efflux from the body, spells could be used upon them which would have the effect of causing grievousharm to that person. Isis noted that Ra had become old and feeble, and that as he went about he dribbled at themouth, and that his saliva fell upon the ground. Watching her opportunity she caught some of the saliva of theand mixing it with dust, she moulded it into the form of a large serpent, with poison−fangs, and having utteredher spells over it, she left the serpent lying on the path, by which Ra travelled day by day as he went aboutinspecting Egypt, so that it might strike at him as he passed along. We may note in passing that the Banyoro inthe Sudan employ serpents in killing buffaloes at the present day. They catch a puff−adder in a noose, andthen nail it alive by the tip of its tail to the round in the middle of a buffalo track, so that when an animalpasses the reptile may strike at it. Presently a buffalo comes along, does what it is expected to do, and then thepuff−adder strikes at it, injects its poison, and the animal dies soon after. As many as ten buffaloes have beenkilled in a day by one puff−adder. The body of the first buffalo is not eaten, for it is regarded as poisonedmeat, but all the others are used as food.[FN#22]Legends Of The GodsIII. THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS.9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"[FN#22] Johnston, Uganda, vol. ii., p. 584. The authority for this statement is Mr. George Wilson, formerlyCollector in Unyoro.Soon after Isis had placed the serpent on the Path, Ra passed by, and the reptile bit him, thus injecting poisoninto his body. Its effect was terrible, and Ra cried out in agony. His jaws chattered, his lips trembled, and hebecame speechless for a time; never before had be suffered such pain. The gods hearing his cry rushed to him,and when he could speak he told them that he had been bitten by a deadly serpent. In spite of all the words ofpower which were known to him, and his secret name which had been hidden in his body at his birth, aserpent had bitten him, and he was being consumed with a fiery pain. He then commanded that all the godswho had any knowledge of magical spells should come to him, and when they came, Isis, the great lady ofspells, the destroyer of diseases, and the revivifier of the dead, came with them. Turning to Ra she said, “Whathath happened, O divine Father?” and in answer the god told her that a serpent had bitten him, that he washotter than fire and colder than water, that his limbs quaked, and that he was losing the power of sight. ThenIsis said to him with guile, “Divine Father, tell me thy name, for he who uttereth his own name shall live.”Thereupon Ra proceeded to enumerate the various things that he had done, and to describe his creative acts,and ended his speech to Isis by saying, that he was Khepera in the morning, Ra at noon, and Temu in theevening. Apparently he thought that the naming of these three great names would satisfy Isis, and that shewould immediately pronounce a word of power and stop the pain in his body, which, during his speech, hadbecome more acute. Isis, however, was not deceived, and she knew well that Ra had not declared to her hishidden name; this she told him, and she begged him once again to tell her his name. For a time the godrefused to utter the name, but as the pain in his body became more violent, and the poison passed through hisveins like fire, he said, “Isis shall search in me, and my name shall pass from my body into hers.” At thatmoment Ra removed himself from the sight of the gods in his Boat, and the Throne in the Boat of Millions ofYears had no occupant. The great name of Ra was, it seems, hidden in his heart, and Isis, having some doubtas to whether Ra would keep his word or not, agreed with Horus that Ra must be made to take an oath to partwith his two Eyes, that is, the Sun and the Moon. At length Ra allowed his heart to be taken from his body,and his great and secret name, whereby he lived, passed into the possession of Isis. Ra thus became to allintents and purposes a dead god. Then Isis, strong in the power of her spells, said: “Flow, poison, come out ofRa. Eye of Horus, come out of Ra, and shine outside his mouth. It is I, Isis, who work, and I have made thepoison to fall on the ground. Verily the name of the great god is taken from him, Ra shall live and the poisonshall die; if the poison live Ra shall die.”This was the infallible spell which was to be used in cases of poisoning, for it rendered the bite or sting ofevery venomous reptile harmless. It drove the poison out of Ra, and since it was composed by Isis after sheobtained the knowledge of his secret name it was irresistible. If the words were written on papyrus or linenover a figure of Temu or Heru−hekenu, or Isis, or Horus, they became a mighty charm. If the papyrus or linenwere steeped in water and the water drunk, the words were equally efficacious as a charm against snake−bites.To this day water in which the written words of a text from the Kur'an have been dissolved, or water drunkfrom a bowl on the inside of which religious texts have been written, is still regarded as a never−failing charmin Egypt and the Sudan. Thus we see that the modern custom of drinking magical water was derived from theancient Egyptians, who believed that it conveyed into their bodies the actual power of their gods.IV. THE LEGEND OF HERU−BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.The text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics on the walls of the temple of Edfu in Upper Egypt, and certainportions of it are illustrated by large bas−reliefs.

We shall see as we read that the writer of the legend as we have it was notwell acquainted with Egyptian history, and that in his account of the conquest of Egypt he has confounded onegod with another, and mixed up historical facts with mythological legends to such a degree that his meaning isfrequently uncertain. The great fact which he wished to describe is the conquest of Egypt by an early king,who, having subdued the peoples in the South, advanced northwards, and made all the people whom heconquered submit to his yoke. Now the King of Egypt was always called Horus, and the priests of Edfuwishing to magnify their local god, Horus of Behutet, or Horus of Edfu, attributed to him the conquests of thishuman, and probably predynastic, king. We must remember that the legend assumes that Ra, was still reigningon earth, though he was old and feeble, and had probably deputed his power to his successor, whom thelegend regards as his son.PLATE I.

Horus and Isis capturing the Hippopotamus−fiend.In the 363rd year of his reign Ra−Harmakhis[FN#23] was in Nubia with his army with the intention ofdestroying those who had conspired against him; because of their conspiracy (auu) Nubia is called “Uaua\" tothis day. From Nubia Ra−Harmakhis sailed down the river to Edfu, where Heru−Behutet entered his boat, andtold him that his foes were conspiring against him. Ra−Harmakhis in answer addressed Heru−Behutet as hisson, and commanded him to set out without delay and slay the wicked rebels. Then Heru−Behutet took theform of a great winged Disk, and at once flew up into the sky, where he took the place of Ra, the oldSun−god. Looking down from the height of heaven he was able to discover the whereabouts of the rebels, andhe pursued them in the form of a winged disk. Then he attacked them with such violence that they becamedazed, and could neither see where they were going, nor hear, the result of this being that they slew eachother, and in a very short time they were all dead. Thoth, seeing this, told Ra that because Horus had appearedas a great winged disk he must be called “Heru− Behutet,” and by this name Horus was known ever after atEdfu. Ra embraced Horus, and referred with pleasure to the blood which he had shed, and Horus invited hisfather to come and look upon the slain. Ra set out with the goddess Ashthertet (`Ashtoreth) to do this, andthey saw the enemies lying fettered on the ground. The legend here introduces a number of curious derivationsof the names of Edfu, &c., which are valueless, and which remind us of the derivations of place− namespropounded by ancient Semitic scribes.[FN#23] i.e., Ra on the horizon.PLATE V. Horus standing on the back of the Hippopotamus−fiend, and spearing him in the presence of Isis.PLATE VI. The “Butcher−priest” slicing open the Hippopotamus−fiend.In gladness of heart Ra proposed a sail on the Nile, but as soon as his enemies heard that he was coming, theychanged themselves into crocodiles and hippopotami, so that they might be able to wreck his boat and devourhim. As the boat of the god approached them they opened their jaws to crush it, but Horus and his followerscame quickly on the scene, and defeated their purpose. The followers of Horus here mentioned are called inthe text “Mesniu,” i.e., “blacksmiths,” or “workers in metal,” and they represent the primitive conquerors ofthe Egyptians, who were armed with metal weapons, and so were able to overcome with tolerable ease theindigenous Egyptians, whose weapons were made of flint and wood.

Because Horus gained his victory by means of metalweapons, Ra decreed that a metal statue of Horus should be placed at Edfu, and remain there for ever, and aname was given to the town to commemorate the great battle that had taken place there. Ra applauded Horusfor the mighty deeds which be had been able to perform by means of the spells contained in the “Book ofSlaying the Hippopotamus.” Horus then associated with himself the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet, whowere in the form of serpents, and, taking his place as the winged Disk on the front of the Boat of Ra,destroyed all the enemies of Ra wheresoever he found them. When the remnant of the enemies of Ra, saw thatthey were likely to be slain, they doubled back to the South, but Horus pursued them, and drove them downthe river before him as far as Thebes. One battle took place at Tchetmet, and another at Denderah, and Horuswas always victorious; the enemies were caught by chains thrown over them, and the deadly spears of theBlacksmiths drank their blood.After this the enemy fled to the North, and took refuge in the swamps of the Delta, and in the shallows of theMediterranean Sea, and Horus pursued them thither. After searching for them for four days and four nights hefound them, and they were speedily slain. One hundred and forty−two of them and a male hippopotamus weredragged on to the Boat of Ra, and there Horus dug out their entrails, and hacked their carcases in pieces,which he gave to his Blacksmiths and the gods who formed the crew of the Boat of Ra. Before despatchingthe hippopotamus, Horus leaped on to the back of the monster as a mark of his triumph, and to commemoratethis event the priest of Heben, the town wherein these things happened, was called “He who standeth on theback ever after.”The end of the great fight, however, was not yet. Another army of enemies appeared by the North Lake, andthey were marching towards the sea; but terror of Horus smote their hearts, and they fled and took refuge inMertet−Ament, where they allied themselves with the followers of Set, the Arch−fiend and great Enemy ofRa. Thither Horus and his well−armed Blacksmiths pursued them, and came up with them at the town calledPer−Rerehu, which derived its name from the “Two Combatants,” or “Two Men,” Horus and Set. A greatfight took place, the enemies of Ra were defeated with great slaughter, and Horus dragged 381 prisoners on tothe Boat of Ra, where he slew them, and gave their bodies to his followers.PLATE VII.

After this Horus andSet engaged in a fight which lasted a very long time, but at length Horus drove his spear into the neck of Setwith such violence that the Fiend fell headlong to the ground. Then Horus smote with his club the mouthwhich had uttered such blasphemies, and fettered him with his chain. In this state Horus dragged Set into thepresence of Ra, who ascribed great praise to Horus, and special names were given to the palace of Horus andthe high priest of the temple in commemoration of the event. When the question of the disposal of Set wasbeing discussed by the gods, Ra ordered that he and his fiends should be given over to Isis and her son Horus,who were to do what they pleased with them. Horus promptly cut off the heads of Set and his fiends in theLegends Of The GodsIV.

After this Isis appointed Horus of Behutet to be the protecting deity of her son Horus.The fight between the Sun−god and Set was a very favourite subject with Egyptian writers, and there aremany forms of it. Thus there is the fight between Heru−ur and Set, the fight between Ra and Set, the fightbetween Heru−Behutet and Set, the fight between Osiris and Set, and the fight between Horus, son of Isis, andSet. In the oldest times the combat was merely the natural opposition of light to darkness, but later theSun−god became the symbol of right and truth as well as of light, and Set the symbol of sin and wickedness aswell as of darkness, and ultimately the nature myth was forgotten, and the fight between the two gods becamethe type of the everlasting war which good men wage against sin. In Coptic literature we have thewell−known legend of the slaughter of the dragon by St. George, and this is nothing but a Christian adaptationof the legend of Horus and Set.After these things Horus, son of Ra, and Horus, son of Isis, each took the form of a mighty man, with the faceand body of a hawk, and each wore the Red and White Crowns, and each carried a spear and chain. In theseforms the two gods slew the remnant of the enemies. Now by some means or other Set came to life again, andhe took the form of a mighty hissing or “roaring” serpent, and hid himself in the ground, in a place which wasever after called the “place of the roarer.” In front of his hiding−place Horus, son of Isis, stationed himself inthe form of a hawk−headed staff to prevent him from coming out. In spite of this, however, Set managed toescape, and he gathered about him the Smai and Seba fiends at the Lake of Meh, and waged war once moreagainst Horus; the enemies of Ra were again defeated, and Horus slew them in the presence of his father.PLATE XI. Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing human victims with the assistance of Isis.PLATE XII. Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing Set in the form of a crocodile.Horus, it seems, now ceased to fight for some time, and devoted himself to keeping guard over the “GreatGod” who was in An−rut−f, a district in or near Herakleopolis. This Great God was no other than Osiris, andthe duty of Horus was to prevent the Smai fiends from coming by night to the place. In spite of the power ofHorus, it was found necessary to summon the aid of Isis to keep away the fiends, and it was only by her wordsof power that the fiend Ba was kept out of the sanctuary. As a reward for what he had already done, Thothdecreed that Horus should be called the “Master−Fighter.” Passing over the derivations of place− nameswhich occur here in the text, we find that Horus and his Blacksmiths were again obliged to fight bodies of theenemy who had managed to escape, and that on one occasion they killed one hundred and six foes. In everyfight the Blacksmiths performed mighty deeds of valour, and in reward for their services a special district wasallotted to them to dwell in.The last great fight in the North took place at Tanis, in the eastern part of the Delta. When the position of theenemy had been located, Horus took the form of a lion with the face of a man, and he put on his head theTriple Crown. His claws were like flints, and with them he dragged away one hundred and forty−two of theenemy, and tore them in pieces, and dug out their tongues, which he carried off as symbols of his victory.Meanwhile rebellion had again broken out in Nubia, where about one−third of the enemy had taken refuge inthe river in the forms of crocodiles and hippopotami. Ra counselled Horus to sail up the Nile with hisBlacksmiths, and when Thoth had recited the “Chapters of protecting the Boat of Ra” over the boats, theexpedition set sail for the South. The object of reciting these spells was to prevent the monsters which were inthe river from making the waves to rise and from stirring up storms which might engulf the boats of Ra andHorus and the Blacksmiths. When the rebels and fiends who had been uttering, treason against Horus saw theboat of Ra, with the winged Disk of Horus accompanied by the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet in the formof serpents, they were smitten with fear, and their hearts quaked, and all power of resistance left them, andthey died of fright straightway. When Horus returned in triumph to Edfu, Ra ordered that an image of theLegends Of The GodsIV.

Horus of Behutet in the form of a lion slaying his foes.V. LEGEND OF THE BIRTH OF HORUS, SON OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.PLATE XIV. The Procreation of Horus, son of Isis.The text which contains this legend is found cut in hieroglyphics upon a stele which is now preserved in Paris.Attention was first called to it by Chabas, who in 1857 gave a translation of it in the Revue Archeologique, p.65 ff., and pointed out the importance of its contents with his characteristic ability. The hieroglyphic text wasfirst published by Ledrain in his work on the monuments of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris,[FN#24] and Igave a transcript of the text, with transliteration and translation, in 1895.[FN#25][FN#24] Les Monuments Egyptiens (Cabinet des Medailles et Antiques), In the Bibliotheque de l'Ecole desHautes Etudes, Paris, 1879−1882, plate xxii. ff.[FN#25] First Steps in Egyptian, pp. 179−188.The greater part of the text consists of a hymn to Osiris, which was probably composed under the XVIIIthDynasty, when an extraordinary development of the cult of that god took place, and when he was placed byEgyptian theologians at the head of all the gods. Though unseen in the temples, his presence filled all Egypt,and his body formed the very substance of the country. He was the God of all gods and the Governor of theTwo Companies of the gods, he formed the soul and body of Ra, he was the beneficent Spirit of all spirits, hewas himself the celestial food on which the Doubles in the Other World lived. He was the greatest of the godsin On (Heliopolis), Memphis, Herakleopolis, Hermopolis, Abydos, and the region of the First Cataract, andso. He embodied in his own person the might of Ra−Tem, Apis and Ptah, the Horus−gods, Thoth andKhnemu, and his rule over Busiris and Abydos continued to be supreme, as it had been for many, manyhundreds of years. He was the source of the Nile, the north wind sprang from him, his seats were the stars ofheaven which never set, and the imperishable stars were his ministers. All heaven was his dominion, and thedoors of the sky opened before him of their own accord when he appeared. He inherited the earth from hisfather Keb, and the sovereignty of heaven from his mother Nut. In his person he united endless time in thepast and endless time in the future. Like Ra he had fought Seba, or Set, the monster of evil, and had defeatedhim, and his victory assured to him lasting authority over the gods and the dead. He exercised his creativepower in making land and water, trees and herbs, cattle and other four−footed beasts, birds of all kinds, andfish and creeping things; even the waste spaces of the desert owed allegiance to him as the creator. And herolled out the sky, and set the light above the darkness.The last paragraph of the text contains an allusion to Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, and mentions thelegend of the birth of Horus, which even under the XVIIIth Dynasty was very ancient, Isis, we are told, wasthe constant protectress of her brother, she drove away the fiends that wanted to attack him, and kept them outof his shrine and tomb, and she guarded him from all accidents. All these things she did by means of spellsand incantations, large numbers of which were known to her, and by her power as the “witch−goddess.” Her“mouth was trained to perfection, and she made no mistake in pronouncing her spells, and her tongue wasskilled and halted not.” At length came the unlucky day when Set succeeded in killing Osiris during the warwhich the “good god” was waging against him and his fiends. Details of the engagement are wanting, but thePyramid Texts state that the body of Osiris was hurled to the ground by Set at a place called Netat, whichseems to have been near Abydos.[FN#26] The news of the death of Osiris was brought to Isis, and she at onceLegends Of The GodsV.

All legends agree in saying that she took the form of a bird, and that she flew aboutunceasingly, going hither and thither, and uttering wailing cries of grief. At length she found the body, andwith a piercing cry she alighted on the ground. The Pyramid Texts say that Nephthys was with her that “Isiscame, Nephthys came, the one on the right side, the other on the left side, one in the form of a Hat bird, theother in the form of a Tchert bird, and they found Osiris thrown on the ground in Netat by his brother Set.”The late form of the legend goes on to say that Isis fanned the body with her feathers, and produced air, andthat at length she caused the inert members of Osiris to move, and drew from him his essence, wherefrom sheproduced her child Horus.[FN#26] Pepi I., line 475; Pepi II., line 1263.This bare statement of the dogma of the conception of Horus does not represent all that is known about it, andit may well be supplemented by a passage from the Pyramid Texts,[FN#27] which reads, “Adoration to thee,O Osiris.[FN#28] Rise thou up on thy left side, place thyself on thy right side. This water which I give untothee is the water of youth (or rejuvenation). Adoration to thee, O Osiris! Rise thou up on thy left side, placethyself on thy right side. This bread which I have made for thee is warmth. Adoration to thee, O Osiris! Thedoors of heaven are opened to thee, the doors of the streams are thrown wide open to thee.

Thyelder sister took thy body in her arms, she chafed thy hands, she clasped thee to her breast [when] she foundthee [lying] on thy side on the plain of Netat.” And in another place we read:[FN#29] “Thy two sisters, Isisand Nephthys, came to thee, Kam−urt, in thy name of Kam−ur, Uatchet−urt, in thy name of Uatch−ur . . . . . . .Isis and Nephthys weave magical protection for thee in the city of Saut, for thee their lord, in thy name of'Lord of Saut,' for their god, in thy name of 'God.' They praise thee; go not thou far from them in thy name of'Tua.' They present offerings to thee; be not wroth in thy name of 'Tchentru.' Thy sister Isis cometh to theerejoicing in her love for thee.[FN#30] Thou hast union with her, thy seed entereth her. She conceiveth in theform of the star Septet (Sothis). Horus−Sept issueth from thee in the form of Horus, dweller in the star Septet.Thou makest a spirit to be in him in his name 'Spirit dwelling in the god Tchentru.' He avengeth thee in hisname of 'Horus, the son who avenged his father.'

Horus hath presented to thee thy members, hehath collected them completely, there is no disorder in thee. Thoth hath seized thy enemy and hath slain himand those who were with him.” The above words are addressed to dead kings in the Pyramid Texts, and whatthe gods were supposed to do for them was believed by the Egyptians to have been actually done for Osiris.These extracts are peculiarly valuable, for they prove that the legend of Osiris which was current under theXVIIIth Dynasty was based upon traditions which were universally accepted in Egypt under the Vth and VIthDynasties.[FN#27] Mer−en−Ra, line 336; Pepi II., line 862.[FN#28] I omit the king's names.[FN#29] Teta, line 274; Pepi I., line 27; Mer−en−Ra, line 37; and Pepi II., line 67.[FN#30] Pyramid Text, Teta, l. 276.PLATE XV.PLATE XVI.

The text was republishedand translated into French by E. de Rouge in 1858,[FN#34] and several other renderings have been given inGerman and in English since that date.[FN#35] When the text was first published, and for some yearsafterwards, it was generally thought that the legend referred to events which were said to have taken placeunder a king who was identified as Rameses XIII., but this misconception was corrected by Erman, whoshowed[FN#36] that the king was in reality Rameses II. By a careful examination of the construction of thetext he proved that the narrative on the stele was drawn up several hundreds of years after the events describedin it took place, and that its author was but imperfectly acquainted with the form of the Egyptian language inuse in the reign of Rameses II. In fact, the legend was written in the interests of the priests of the temple ofKhensu, who wished to magnify their god and his power to cast out devils and to exorcise evil spirits; it wasprobably composed between B.C. 650 and B.C. 250.[FN#37][FN#32] Choix de Monuments Egyptiens, Paris, 1847, plate xxiv.[FN#33] Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature, New Series, vol. iv., p. 217 ff.[FN#34] Journal Asiatique (Etude sur une Stele Egyptienne), August, 1856, August, 1857, and August−Sept.,1858, Paris, 8vo, with plate.[FN#35] Brugsch, Geschichte Aegyptens, 1877, p. 627 ff.; Birch, Records of the Past, Old Series, vol. iv., p.53 ff.; Budge, Egyptian Reading Book, text and transliteration, p. 40 ff.; translation, p. xxviii. ff.[FN#36] Aeg. Zeit., 1883, pp. 54−60.[FN#37] Maspero, Les Contes Populaires, 3rd edit., p. 166.The legend, after enumerating the great names of Rameses II., goes on to state that the king was in the“country of the two rivers,” by which we are to understand some portion of Mesopotamia, the rivers being theTigris and Euphrates, and that the local chiefs were bringing to him tribute consisting of gold, lapis−lazuli,turquoise, and logs of wood from the Land of the God. It is difficult to understand how gold and logs of woodfrom Southern Arabia and East Africa came to be produced as tribute by chiefs who lived so far to the north.Among those who sent gifts was the Prince of Bekhten, and at the head of all his tribute he sent his eldestdaughter, bearing his message of homage and duty. Now the maiden was beautiful, and the King of Egyptthought her so lovely that be took her to wife, and bestowed upon her the name “Ra− neferu,” which meanssomething like the “beauties of Ra.” He took her back with him to Egypt, where she was installed as Queen.During the summer of the fifteenth year of his reign, whilst Rameses II. was celebrating a festival ofAmen−Ra in the Temple of Luxor, one came to him and reported that an envoy had arrived from the Prince ofLegends Of The GodsVI. A LEGEND OF KHENSU NEFER−HETEP[FN#31] AND THE PRINCESS OF BEKHTEN.16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Bekhten, bearing with him many gifts for the Royal Wife Ra−neferu. When the envoy had been brought intothe presence, he addressed words of homage to the king, and, having presented the gifts from his lord, he saidthat he had come to beg His Majesty to send a “learned man,” i.e., a magician, to Bekhten to attendBent−enth−resh, His Majesty's sister−in−law, who was stricken with some disease. Thereupon the kingsummoned the learned men of the House of Life, i.e., the members of the great College of Magic at Thebes,and the qenbetu officials, and when they had entered his presence, he commanded them to select a man of“wise heart and deft fingers” to go to Bekhten. The choice fell upon one Tehuti−em−heb, and His Majestysent him to Bekhten with the envoy. When they arrived in Bekhten, Tehuti−em−heb found that the PrincessBent−enth−resh was possessed by an evil spirit which refused to be exorcised by him, and he was unable tocast out the devil. The Prince of Bekhten, seeing that the healing of his daughter was beyond the power of theEgyptian, sent a second envoy to Rameses II., and besought him to send a god to drive out the devil. Thisenvoy arrived in Egypt in the summer of the twenty−sixth year of the reign of Rameses II., and found the kingcelebrating a festival in Thebes. When he heard the petition of the envoy, he went to the Temple of KhensuNefer−hetep “a second time,”[FN#38] and presented himself before the god and besought his help on behalfof his sister−in−law.[FN#38] Thus the king must have invoked the help of Khensu on the occasion of the visit of the first envoy.Then the priests of Khensu Nefer−hetep carried the statue of this god to the place where was the statue ofKhensu surnamed “Pa−ari−sekher,” i.e., the “Worker of destinies,” who was able to repel the attacks of evilspirits and to drive them out. When the statues of the two gods were facing each other, Rameses II. entreatedKhensu Nefer−hetep to “turn his face towards,” i.e., to look favourably upon Khensu. Pa−ari− sekher, and tolet him go to Bekhten to drive the devil out of the Princess of Bekhten. The text affords no explanation of thefact that Khensu Nefer−hetep was regarded as a greater god than Khensu Pa−ari− sekher, or why hispermission had to be obtained before the latter could leave the country. It is probable that the demands madeupon Khensu Nefer−hetep by the Egyptians who lived in Thebes and its neighbourhood were so numerousthat it was impossible to let his statue go into outlying districts or foreign lands, and that a deputy−god wasappointed to perform miracles outside Thebes. This arrangement would benefit the people, and would,moreover, bring much money to the priests. The appointment of a deputy−god is not so strange as it mayseem, and modern African peoples are familiar with the expedient. About one hundred years ago the priests ofthe god Bobowissi of Winnebah, in the Tshi region of West Africa, found their business so large that it wasabsolutely necessary for them to appoint a deputy. The priests therefore selected Brahfo, i.e., “deputy,” andgave out that Bobowissi had deputed all minor matters to him, and that his utterances were to be regarded asthose of Bobowissi. Delegates were ordered to be sent to Winnebah in Ashanti, where they would be shownthe “deputy” god by the priests, and afterwards he would be taken to Mankassim, where he would reside, anddo for the people all that Bobowissi had done hitherto.[FN#39][FN#39] Ellis, Tshi−speaking Peoples, p. 55.When Rameses II. had made his petition to Khensu Nefer−hetep, the statue of the god bowed its head twice,in token of assent. Here it is clear that we have an example of the use of statues with movable limbs, whichwere worked, when occasion required, by the priests. The king then made a second petition to the god totransfer his sa, or magical power, to Khensu Pa−ari−sekher so that when he had arrived in Bekhten he wouldbe able to heal the Princess. Again the statue of Khensu Nefer−hetep bowed its head twice, and the petition ofthe king was granted. The text goes on to say that the magical power of the greater god was transferred to thelesser god four times, or in a fourfold measure, but we are not told how this was effected. We know frommany passages in the texts that every god was believed to possess this magical power, which is called the “saof life,” or the “sa of the god,”.[FN#40] This sa could be transferred by a god or goddess to a human being,either by an embrace or through some offering which was eaten. Thus Temu transferred the magical power ofhis life to Shu and Tefnut by embracing them,[FN#41] and in the Ritual of the Divine Cult[FN#42] the priestsays, The two vessels of milk of Temu are the “sa of my limbs.” The man who possessed this sa could transferLegends Of The GodsVI. A LEGEND OF KHENSU NEFER−HETEP[FN#31] AND THE PRINCESS OF BEKHTEN.17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"it to his friend by embracing him and then “making passes” with his hands along his back. The sa could bereceived by a man from a god and then transmitted by him to a statue by taking it in his arms, and thisceremony was actually performed by the king in the Ritual of the Divine Cult.[FN#43] The primary source ofthis sa was Ra, who bestowed it without measure on the blessed dead,[FN#44] and caused them to live forever thereby. These, facts make it tolerably certain that the magical power of Khensu Nefer−hetep wastransferred to Khensu Pa−ari−sekher in one of two ways: either the statue of the latter was brought near to thatof the former and it received the sa by contact, or the high priest first received the sa from the greater god andthen transmitted it to the lesser god by embraces and “passes” with his hands. Be this as it may, KhensuPa−ari−sekher received the magical power, and having been placed in his boat, he set out for Bekhten,accompanied by five smaller boats, and chariots and horses which marched on each side of him.[FN#40] Text of Unas, line 562.[FN#41] Pyramid Texts, Pepi I., l. 466.[FN#42] Ed. Moret, p. 21.[FN#43] Ibid., p. 99.[FN#44] Pepi I., line 666.When after a journey of seventeen months Khensu Pa−ari−sekher arrived in Bekhten, he was cordiallywelcomed by the Prince, and, having gone to the place where the Princess who was possessed of a devil lived,he exercised his power to such purpose that she was healed immediately. Moreover, the devil which had beencast out admitted that Khensu Pa− ari−sekher was his master, and promised that he would depart to the placewhence he came, provided that the Prince of Bekhten would celebrate a festival in his honour before hisdeparture. Meanwhile the Prince and his soldiers stood by listening to the conversation between the god andthe devil, and they were very much afraid. Following the instructions of Khensu Pa−ari−sekher the Princemade a great feast in honour of the supernatural visitors, and then the devil departed to the “place which heloved,” and there was general rejoicing in the land. The Prince of Bekhten was so pleased with the Egyptiangod that he determined not to allow him to return to Egypt. When the statue of Khensu Pa−ari−sekher hadbeen in Bekhten for three years and nine months, the Prince in a vision saw the god, in the form of a goldenhawk, come forth from his shrine, and fly up into the air and direct his course to Egypt. Realizing that thestatue of the god was useless without its indwelling spirit, the Prince of Bekhten permitted the priests ofKhensu Pa−ari−sekher to depart with it to Egypt, and dismissed them with gifts of all kinds. In due coursethey arrived in Egypt and the priests took their statue to the temple of Khensu Nefer−hetep, and handed overto that god all the gifts which the Prince of Bekhten had given them, keeping back nothing for their own god.After this Khensu Pa−ari−sekher returned to his temple in peace, in the thirty−third year of the reign ofRameses II., having been absent from it about eight years.VII. A LEGEND OF KHNEMU AND OF A SEVEN YEARS' FAMINE.The text of this most interesting legend is found in hieroglyphics on one side of a large rounded block ofgranite some eight or nine feet high, which stands on the south−east portion of Sahal, a little island lying inthe First Cataract, two or three miles to the south of Elephantine Island and the modern town of Aswan. Theinscription is not cut into the rock in the ordinary way, but was “stunned” on it with a blunted chisel, and is, insome lights, quite invisible to anyone standing near the rock, unless he is aware of its existence. It is in fullview of the river−path which leads from Mahallah to Philae, and yet it escaped the notice of scores oftravellers who have searched the rocks and islands in the Cataract for graffiti and inscriptions. The inscription,which covers a space six feet by five feet, was discovered accidentally on February 6th, 1889, by the late Mr.C. E. Wilbour, a distinguished American gentleman who spent many years in research in Egypt. He firstLegends Of The GodsVII. A LEGEND OF KHNEMU AND OF A SEVEN YEARS' FAMINE.18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"copied the text, discovering in the course of his work the remarkable nature of its contents and then his friendMr. Maudslay photographed it. The following year he sent prints from Mr. Maudslay's negatives to Dr.Brugsch, who in the course of 1891 published a transcript of the text with a German translation and notes in awork entitled Die biblischen sieben Jahre der Hungersnoth, Leipzig, 8vo.The legend contained in this remarkable text describes a terrible famine which took place in the reign ofTcheser, a king of the IIIrd Dynasty, and lasted for seven years. Insufficient Nile−floods were, of course, thephysical cause of the famine, but the legend shows that the “low Niles” were brought about by the neglect ofthe Egyptians in respect of the worship of the god of the First Cataract, the great god Khnemu. When,according to the legend, king Tcheser had been made to believe that the famine took place because men hadceased to worship Khnemu in a manner appropriate to his greatness, and when he had taken steps to removethe ground of complaint, the Nile rose to its accustomed height, the crops became abundant once more, and allmisery caused by scarcity of provisions ceased. In other words, when Tcheser restored the offerings ofKhnemu, and re−endowed his sanctuary and his priesthood, the god allowed Hapi to pour forth his streamsfrom the caverns in the Cataract, and to flood the land with abundance. The general character of the legend, aswe have it here, makes it quite certain that it belongs to a late period, and the forms of the hieroglyphics andthe spellings of the words indicate that the text was “stunned” on the rock in the reign of one of the Ptolemies,probably at a time when it was to the interest of some men to restore the worship of Khnemu, god of the FirstCataract. These interested people could only have been the priests of Khnemu, and the probability that thiswas so becomes almost a certainty when we read in the latter part of the text the list of the tolls and taxeswhich they were empowered to levy on the merchants, farmers, miners, etc., whose goods passed down theCataract into Egypt. Why, if this be the case, they should have chosen to connect the famine with the reign ofTcheser is not clear. They may have wished to prove the great antiquity of the worship of Khnemu, but itwould have been quite easy to select the name of some king of the Ist Dynasty, and had they done this, theywould have made the authority of Khnemu over the Nile coaeval with Dynastic civilization. It is impossible toassume that no great famine took place in Egypt between the reign of Tcheser and the period when theinscription was made, and when we consider this fact the choice by the editor of the legend of a famine whichtook place under the IIIrd Dynasty to illustrate the power of Khnemu seems inexplicable.Of the famines which must have taken place in the Dynastic period the inscriptions tell us nothing, but thestory of the seven years' famine mentioned in the Book of Genesis shows that there is nothing improbable in afamine lasting so long in Egypt. Arab historians also mention several famines which lasted for seven years.That which took place in the years 1066−1072 nearly ruined the whole country. A cake of bread was sold for15 dinanir, (the dinar = 10s.), a horse was sold for 20, a dog for 5, a cat for 3, and an egg for 1 dinar. When allthe animals were eaten men began to eat each other, and human flesh was sold in public. “Passengers werecaught in the streets by hooks let down from the windows, drawn up, killed, and cooked.”[FN#45] During thefamine which began in 1201 people ate human flesh habitually. Parents killed and cooked their own children,and a wife was found eating her husband raw. Baby fricassee and haggis of children's heads were ordinaryarticles of diet. The graves even were ransacked for food. An ox sold for 70 dinanir. [FN#46][FN#45] Lane Poole, Middle Ages, p. 146.[FN#46] Ibid., p. 216.The legend begins with the statement that in the 18th year of the reign of King Tcheser, when Matar, the ErpaPrince and Ha, was the Governor of the temple properties of the South and North, and was also the Director ofthe Khenti men at Elephantine (Aswan), a royal despatch was delivered to him, in which the king said: “I amin misery on my throne. My heart is very sore because of the calamity which hath happened, for the Nile hathnot come forth[FN#47] for seven years. There is no grain, there are no vegetables, there is no food, and everyman is robbing his neighbour. Men wish to walk, but they are unable to move; the young man drags along hislimbs, the hearts of the aged are crushed with despair, their legs fail them, they sink to the ground, and theyLegends Of The GodsVII.

The councillors are dumb, and nothing but wind comes out of thegranaries when they are opened. Everything is in a state of ruin.” A more graphic picture of the misery causedby the famine could hardly be imagined. The king then goes on to ask Matar where the Nile is born? what godor goddess presides over it? and what is his [or her] form? He says he would like to go to the temple of Thothto enquire of that god, to go to the College of the Magicians, and search through the sacred books in order tofind out these things.[FN#47] i.e., there have been insufficient Nile−floods.When Matar had read the despatch, he set out to go to the king, and explained to him the things which hewished to know. He told him that, the Nile rose near the city of Elephantine, that it flowed out of two caverns,which were the breasts of the Nile−god, that it rose to a height of twenty−eight cubits at Elephantine, and tothe height of seven cubits at Sma−Behutet, or, Diospolis Parva in the Delta. He who controlled the Nile wasKhnemu, and when this god drew the bolt of the doors which shut in the stream, and smote the earth with hissandals, the river rushed forth. Matar also described to the king the form of Khnemu, which was that of Shu,and the work which he did, and the wooden house in which he lived, and its exact position, which was nearthe famous granite quarries. The gods who dwelt with Khnemu were the goddess Sept (Sothis, or theDog−star), the goddess Anqet, Hap (or Hep), the Nile−god, Shu, Keb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Horus.Thus we see that the priests of Khnemu made him to be the head of a Company of Gods. Finally Matar gavethe king a list of all the stones, precious and otherwise, which were found in and about Elephantine.When the king, who had, it seems, come to Elephantine, heard these things he rejoiced greatly, and he wentinto the temple of Khnemu. The priests drew back the curtains and sprinkled him with holy water, and then hepassed into the shrine and offered up a great sacrifice of bread−cakes, beer, geese, oxen, and all kinds of goodthings, to the gods and goddesses who dwelt at Elephantine, in the place called “Couch of the heart in life andpower.” Suddenly he found himself standing face to face with the god Khnemu, whom he placated with apeace−offering and with prayer. Then the god opened his eyes, and bent his body towards the king, and spaketo him mighty words, saying, “I am Khnemu, who made thee. My hands knitted together thy body and made itsound, and I gave thee thy heart.” Khnemu then went on to complain that, although the ground under theking's feet was filled with stones and metal, men were too inert to work them and to employ them in repairingor rebuilding of the shrines of the gods, or in doing what they ought to do for him, their Lord and Creator.These words were, of course, meant as a rebuke for the king, who evidently, though it is not so stated in thetext, was intended by Khnemu to undertake the rebuilding of his shrine without delay. The god then went onto proclaim his majesty and power, and declared himself to be Nu, the Celestial Ocean, and the Nile−god,“who came into being at the beginning, and riseth at his will to give health to him that laboureth for Khnemu.”He described himself as the Father of the gods, the Governor of the earth and of men, and then he promisedthe king to make the Nile rise yearly, regularly, and unceasingly, to give abundant harvests, to give all peopletheir heart's desire, to make misery to pass away, to fill the granaries, and to make the whole land of Egyptyellow with waving fields of full ripe grain. When the king, who had been in a dream, heard the god mentioncrops, he woke up, and his courage returned to him, and having cast away despair from his heart he issued adecree by which he made ample provision for the maintenance of the worship of the god in a fitting state. Inthis decree, the first copy of which was cut upon wood, the king endowed Khnemu with 20 schoinoi of landon each side of the river, with gardens, etc. It was further enacted that every man who drew water from theNile for his land should contribute a portion of his crops to the god. Fishermen, fowlers, and hunters were topay an octroi duty of one−tenth of the value of their catches when they brought them into the city, and a titheof the cattle was to be set apart for the daily sacrifice. The masters of caravans coming from the Sudan were topay a tithe also, but they were not liable to any further tax in the country northwards. Every metal−worker,ore−crusher, miner, mason, and handicraftsman of every kind, was to pay to the temple of the god one−tenthof the value of the material produced or worked by his labour. The decree provided also for the appointmentof an inspector whose duty it would be to weigh the gold, silver and copper which came into the town ofElephantine, and to assess the value both of these metals and of the precious stones, etc., which were to beLegends Of The GodsVII.

He who failed in any way to complywith the enactments was to be beaten with the rope, and the name of Tcheser was to be perpetuated in thetemple.VIII. THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF HORUS, ANDOTHER MAGICAL TEXTS.The magical and religious texts of the Egyptians of all periods contain spells intended to be used againstserpents, scorpions, and noxious reptiles of all kinds, and their number, and the importance which wasattached to them, suggest that Egypt must always have produced these pests in abundance, and that theEgyptians were always horribly afraid of them. The text of Unas, which was written towards the close of theVth Dynasty, contains many such spells, and in the Theban and Saite Books of the Dead several Chaptersconsist of nothing but spells and incantations, many of which are based on archaic texts, against crocodiles,serpents, and other deadly reptiles, and insects of all kinds. All such creatures were regarded as incarnations ofevil spirits, which attack the dead as well as the living, and therefore it was necessary for the well−being ofthe former that copies of spells against them should be written upon the walls of tombs, coffins, funeraryamulets, etc. The gods were just as open to the attacks of venomous reptiles as man, and Ra, himself, the kingof the gods, nearly died from the poison of a snake−bite. Now the gods were, as a rule, able to defendthemselves against the attacks of Set and his fiends, and the poisonous snakes and insects which were theiremissaries, by virtue of the fluid of life, which was the peculiar attribute of divinity, and the efforts ofEgyptians were directed to the acquisition of a portion of this magical power, which would protect their soulsand bodies and their houses and cattle, and other property, each day and each night throughout the year. Whena man cared for the protection of himself only he wore an amulet of some kind, in which the fluid of life waslocalized. When he wished to protect his house against invasion by venomous reptiles he placed statuescontaining the fluid of life in niches in the walls of various chambers, or in some place outside but near thehouse, or buried them in the earth with their faces turned in the direction from which he expected the attack tocome.PLATE XVII. The Metternich Stele—Obverse.PLATE XVIII. The Metternich Stele—Reverse.Towards the close of the XXVIth Dynasty, when superstition in its most exaggerated form was general inEgypt, it became the custom to make house talismans in the form of small stone stelae, with rounded tops,which rested on bases having convex fronts. On the front of such a talisman was sculptured in relief a figureof Horus the Child (Harpokrates), standing on two crocodiles, holding in his hands figures of serpents,scorpions, a lion, and a horned animal, each of these being a symbol of an emissary or ally of Set, the god ofEvil. Above his head was the head of Bes, and on each side of him were: solar symbols, i.e., the lily ofNefer−Tem, figures of Ra and Harmakhis, the Eyes of Ra (the Sun and Moon), etc. The reverse of the steleand the whole of the base were covered with magical texts and spells, and when a talisman of this kind wasplaced in a house, it was supposed to be directly under the protection of Horus and his companion gods, whohad vanquished all the hosts of darkness and all the powers of physical and moral evil. Many examples of thistalisman are to be seen in the great Museums of Europe, and there are several fine specimens in the ThirdEgyptian Room in the British Museum. They are usually called “Cippi of Horus.” The largest and mostimportant of all these “cippi” is that which is commonly known as the “Metternich Stele,” because it wasgiven to Prince Metternich by Muhammad `Ali Pasha; it was dug up in 1828 during the building of a cisternin a Franciscan Monastery in Alexandria, and was first published, with a translation of a large part of the text,Legends Of The GodsVIII. THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF HORUS, AND OTHER MAGICAL TEXTS.21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"by Professor Golenischeff.[FN#48] The importance of the stele is enhanced by the fact that it mentions thename of the king in whose reign it was made, viz., Nectanebus I., who reigned from B.C. 378 to B.C. 360.[FN#48] See Metternichstele, Leipzig, 1877. The Stele was made for Ankh−Psemthek, son of the ladyTent−Het−nub, prophet of Nebun, overseer of Temt and scribe of Het (see line 87).The obverse, reverse, and two sides of the Metternich Stele have cut upon them nearly three hundred figuresof gods and celestial beings. These include figures of the great gods of heaven, earth, and the Other World,figures of the gods of the planets and the Dekans, figures of the gods of the days of the week, of the weeks,and months, and seasons of the year, and of the year. Besides these there are a number of figures of localforms of the gods which it is difficult to identify. On the rounded portion of the obverse the place of honour isheld by the solar disk, in which is seen a figure of Khnemu with four ram's heads, which rests between a pairof arms, and is supported on a lake of celestial water; on each side of it are four of the spirits of the dawn, andon the right stands the symbol of the rising sun, Nefer−Temu, and on the left stands Thoth. Below this are fiverows of small figures of gods. Below these is Harpokrates in relief, in the attitude already described. He standson two crocodiles under a kind of canopy, the sides of which are supported by Thoth and Isis, and holdsTyphonic animals and reptiles. Above the canopy are the two Eyes of Ra, each having a pair of human armsand hands. On the right of Harpokrates are Seker and Horus, and on his left the symbol of Nefer−Temu. Onthe left and right are the goddesses Nekhebet and Uatchet, who guard the South of Egypt and the Northrespectively. On the reverse and sides are numerous small figures of gods. This stele represented the power toprotect man possessed by all the divine beings in the universe, and, however it was placed, it formed animpassable barrier to every spirit of evil and to every venomous reptile. The spells, which are cut inhieroglyphics on all the parts of the stele not occupied by figures of gods, were of the most potent character,for they contained the actual words by which the gods vanquished the powers of darkness and evil. Thesespells form the texts which are printed on p. 142 ff., and may be thus summarized:—The first spell is an incantation directed against reptiles and noxious creatures in general. The chief of thesewas Apep, the great enemy of Ra, who took the form of a huge serpent that “resembled the intestines,” and thespell doomed him to decapitation, and burning and backing in pieces. These things would be effected bySerqet, the Scorpion−goddess. The second part of the spell was directed against the poison of Apep, and wasto be recited over anyone who was bitten by a snake. When uttered by Horus it made Apep to vomit, andwhen used by a magician properly qualified would make the bitten person to vomit, and so free his body fromthe poison.The next spell is directed to be said to the Cat, i.e., a symbol of the daughter of Ra, or Isis, who had the headof Ra, the eyes of the uraeus, the nose of Thoth, the ears of Neb−er−tcher, the mouth of Tem, the neck ofNeheb−ka, the breast of Thoth, the heart of Ra, the hands of the gods, the belly of Osiris, the thighs ofMenthu, the legs of Khensu, the feet of Amen−Horus, the haunches of Horus, the soles of the feet of Ra, andthe bowels of Meh−urit. Every member of the Cat contained a god or goddess, and she was able to destroy thepoison of any serpent, or scorpion, or reptile, which might be injected into her body. The spell opens with anaddress to Ra, who is entreated to come to his daughter, who has been stung by a scorpion on a lonely road,and to cause the poison to leave her body. Thus it seems as if Isis, the great magician, was at some time stungby a scorpion.The next section is very difficult to understand. Ra−Harmakhis is called upon to come to his daughter, andShu to his wife, and Isis to her sister, who has been poisoned. Then the Aged One, i.e., Ra, is asked to letThoth turn back Neha−her, or Set. “Osiris is in the water, but Horus is with him, and the Great Beetleovershadows him,” and every evil spirit which dwells in the water is adjured to allow Horus to proceed toOsiris. Ra, Sekhet, Thoth, and Heka, this last− named being the spell personified, are the four great gods whoprotect Osiris, and who will blind and choke his enemies, and cut out their tongues. The cry of the Cat is againreferred to, and Ra is asked if he does not remember the cry which came from the bank of Netit. The allusionLegends Of The GodsVIII.

Isis, it seems, was shut up in some dwelling by Set after he murdered Osiris, probablywith the intention of forcing her to marry him, and so assist him to legalize his seizure of the kingdom. Isis, aswe have already seen, had been made pregnant by her husband after his death, and Thoth now appeared to her,and advised her to hide herself with her unborn child, and to bring him forth in secret, and he promised herthat her son should succeed in due course to his father's throne. With the help of Thoth she escaped from hercaptivity, and went forth accompanied by the Seven Scorpion−goddesses, who brought her to the town ofPer−Sui, on the edge of the Reed Swamps. She applied to a woman for a night's shelter, but the woman shuther door in her face. To punish her one of the Scorpion−goddesses forced her way into the woman's house,and stung her child to death. The grief of the woman was so bitter and sympathy−compelling that Isis laid herhands on the child, and, having uttered one of her most potent spells over him, the poison of the scorpion ranout of his body, and the child came to life again. The words of the spell are cut on the Stele, and they weretreasured by the Egyptians as an infallible remedy for scorpion stings. When the woman saw that her son hadbeen brought back to life by Isis, she was filled with joy and gratitude, and, as a mark of her repentance, shebrought large quantities of things from her house as gifts for Isis, and they were so many that they filled thehouse of the kind, but poor, woman who had given Isis shelter.Now soon after Isis had restored to life the son of the woman who had shown churlishness to her, a terriblecalamity fell upon her, for her beloved son Horus was stung by a scorpion and died. The news of this eventwas conveyed to her by the gods, who cried out to her to come to see her son Horus, whom the terriblescorpion Uhat had killed. Isis, stabbed with pain at the news, as if a knife had been driven into her body, ranout distraught with grief. It seems that she had gone to perform a religious ceremony in honour of Osiris in atemple near Hetep−hemt, leaving her child carefully concealed in Sekhet−An. During her absence thescorpion Uhat, which had been sent by Set, forced its way into the biding−place of Horus, and there stung himto death. When Isis came and found the dead body, she burst forth in lamentations, the sound of whichbrought all the people from the neighbouring districts to her side. As she related to them the history of hersufferings they endeavoured to console her, and when they found this to be impossible they lifted up theirvoices and wept with her. Then Isis placed her nose in the mouth of Horus so that she might discover if he stillbreathed, but there was no breath in his throat; and when she examined the wound in his body made by thefiend Aun−Ab she saw in it traces of poison. No doubt about his death then remained in her mind, andclasping him in her arms she lifted him up, and in her transports of grief leaped about like fish when they arelaid on red−hot coals. Then she uttered a series of heartbreaking laments, each of which begins with the words“Horus is bitten.” The heir of heaven, the son of Un−Nefer, the child of the gods, he who was wholly fair, isbitten! He for whose wants I provided, he who was to avenge his father, is bitten! He for whom I cared andsuffered when he was being fashioned in my womb, is bitten! He whom I tended so that I might gaze uponhim, is bitten! He whose life I prayed for is bitten! Calamity hath overtaken the child, and he hath perished.Whilst Isis was saying these and many similar words, her sister Nephthys, who had been weeping bitterly forher nephew Horus as she wandered about among the swamps, came, in company with the Scorpion−goddessSerqet, and advised Isis to pray to heaven for help. Pray that the sailors in the Boat of Ra may cease fromrowing, for the Boat cannot travel onwards whilst Horus lies dead. Then Isis cried out to heaven, and hervoice reached the Boat of Millions of Years, and the Disk ceased to move onward, and came to a standstill.From the Boat Thoth descended, being equipped with words of power and spells of all kinds, and bearing withhim the “great command of maa−kheru,” i.e., the WORD, whose commands were performed, instantly andcompletely, by every god, spirit, fiend, human being and by every thing, animate and inanimate, in heaven,earth, and the Other World. Then he came to Isis and told her that no harm could possibly have happened toHorus, for he was under the protection of the Boat of Ra; but his words failed to comfort Isis, and though sheLegends Of The GodsVIII.

Evil, evil is his destiny,for it hath entailed the deepest misery for him and death.”In answer to these words Thoth, turning to Isis and Nephthys, bade them to fear not, and to have no anxietyabout Horus, “For,” said he, “I have come from heaven to heal the child for his mother.” He then pointed outthat Horus was under protection as the Dweller in his Disk (Aten), the Great Dwarf, the Mighty Ram, theGreat Hawk, the Holy Beetle, the Hidden Body, the Divine Bennu, etc., and proceeded to utter the great spellwhich restored Horus to life. By his words of power Thoth transferred the fluid of life of Ra, and as soon asthis came upon the child's body the poison of the scorpion flowed out of him, and he once more breathed andlived. When this was done Thoth returned to the Boat of Ra, the gods who formed its crew resumed theirrowing, and the Disk passed on its way to make its daily journey across the sky. The gods in heaven, whowere amazed and uttered cries of terror when they heard of the death of Horus, were made happy once more,and sang songs of joy over his recovery. The happiness of Isis in her child's restoration to life was very great,for she could again hope that he would avenge his father's murder, and occupy his throne. The final words ofThoth comforted her greatly, for he told her that he would take charge of the case of Horus in the JudgmentHall of Anu, wherein Osiris had been judged, and that as his advocate he would make any accusations whichmight be brought against Horus to recoil on him that brought them. Furthermore, he would give Horus powerto repulse any attacks which might be made upon him by beings in the heights above, or fiends in the depthsbelow, and would ensure his succession to the Throne of the Two Lands, i.e., Egypt. Thoth also promised Isisthat Ra himself should act as the advocate of Horus, even as he had done for his father Osiris. He was alsocareful to allude to the share which Isis had taken in the restoration of Horus to life, saying, “It is the words ofpower of his mother which have lifted up his face, and they shall enable him to journey wheresoever hepleaseth, and to put fear into the powers above. I myself hasten [to obey them].” Thus everything turned onthe power of the spells of Isis, who made the sun to stand still, and caused the dead to be raised.Such are the contents of the texts on the famous Metternich Stele. There appears to be some confusion in theirarrangement, and some of them clearly are misplaced, and, in places, the text is manifestly corrupt. It isimpossible to explain several passages, for we do not understand all the details of the system of magic whichthey represent. Still, the general meaning of the texts on the Stele is quite clear, and they record a legend ofIsis and Horus which is not found so fully described on any other monument.IX. THE HISTORY OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.The history of Isis and Osiris given on pp. 248 is taken from the famous treatise of Plutarch entitled De Isideet Osiride, and forms a fitting conclusion to this volume of Legends of the Gods. It contains all the essentialfacts given in Plutarch's work, and the only things omitted are his derivations and mythological speculations,which are really unimportant for the Egyptologist. Egyptian literature is full of allusions to events which tookplace in the life of Osiris, and to his persecution, murder, and resurrection, and numerous texts of all periodsdescribe the love and devotion of his sister and wife Isis, and the filial piety of Horus. Nowhere, however,have we in Egyptian a connected account of the causes which led to the murder by Set of Osiris, or of thesubsequent events which resulted in his becoming the king of heaven and judge of the dead. Howevercarefully we piece together the fragments of information which we can extract from native Egyptian literature,there still remains a series of gaps which can only be filled by guesswork. Plutarch, as a learned man and astudent of comparative religion and mythology was most anxious to understand the history of Isis and Osiris,which Greek and Roman scholars talked about freely, and which none of them comprehended, and he madeenquiries of priests and others, and examined critically such information as he could obtain, believing andhoping that he would penetrate the mystery in which these gods were wrapped. As a result of his labours hecollected a number of facts about the form of the Legend of Isis and Osiris as it was known to the learned menof his day, but there is no evidence that he had the slightest knowledge of the details of the original AfricanLegends Of The GodsIX. THE HISTORY OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Legend of these gods as it was known to the Egyptians, say, under the VIth Dynasty. Moreover, he neverrealized that the characteristics and attributes of both Isis and Osiris changed several times during the longhistory of Egypt, and that a thousand years before he lived the Egyptians themselves had forgotten what theoriginal form of the legend was. They preserved a number of ceremonies, and performed very carefully all thedetails of an ancient ritual at the annual commemoration festival of Osiris which was held in November andDecember, but the evidence of the texts makes it quite clear that the meaning and symbolism of nearly all thedetails were unknown alike to priests and people.An important modification of the cult of Isis and Osiris took place in the third century before Christ, when thePtolemies began to consolidate their rule in Egypt. A form of religion which would be acceptable both toEgyptians and Greeks had to be provided, and this was produced by modifying the characteristics of Osirisand calling him Sarapis, and identifying him with the Greek Pluto. To Isis were added many of the attributesof the great Greek goddesses, and into her worship were introduced “mysteries” derived from non−Egyptiancults, which made it acceptable to the people everywhere. Had a high priest of Osiris who lived at Abydosunder the XVIIIth Dynasty witnessed the celebration of the great festival of Isis and Osiris in any large townin the first century before Christ, it is tolerably certain that he would have regarded it as a lengthy act ofworship of strange gods, in which there appeared, here and there, ceremonies and phrases which remindedhim of the ancient Abydos ritual. When the form of the cult of Isis and Osiris introduced by the Ptolemies intoEgypt extended to the great cities of Greece and Italy, still further modifications took place in it, and thecharacters of Isis and Osiris were still further changed. By degrees Osiris came to be regarded as the god ofdeath pure and simple, or as the personification of Death, and he ceased to be regarded as the great protectingancestral spirit, and the all−powerful protecting Father of his people. As the importance of Osiris declined thatof Isis grew, and men came to regard her as the great Mother−goddess of the world. The priests describedfrom tradition the great facts of her life according to the Egyptian legends, how she had been a loving anddevoted wife, how she had gone forth after her husband's murder by Set to seek for his body, how she hadfound it and brought it home, how she revivified it by her spells and had union with Osiris and conceived byhim, and how in due course she brought forth her son, in pain and sorrow and loneliness in the Swamps of theDelta, and how she reared him and watched over him until he was old enough to fight and vanquish hisfather's murderer, and how at length she seated him in triumph on his father's throne. These things endearedIsis to the people everywhere, and as she herself had not suffered death like Osiris, she came to be regarded asthe eternal mother of life and of all living things. She was the creatress of crops, she produced fruit,vegetables, plants of all kinds and trees, she made cattle prolific, she brought men and women together andgave them offspring, she was the authoress of all love, virtue, goodness and happiness. She made the light toshine, she was the spirit of the Dog−star which heralded the Nile−flood, she was the source of the power inthe beneficent light of the moon; and finally she took the dead to her bosom and gave them peace, andintroduced them to a life of immortality and happiness similar to that which she had bestowed upon Osiris.The message of the cult of Isis as preached by her priests was one of hope and happiness, and coming to theGreeks and Romans, as it did, at a time when men were weary of their national cults, and when thespeculations of the philosophers carried no weight with the general public, the people everywhere welcomed itwith the greatest enthusiasm. From Egypt it was carried to the Islands of Greece and to the mainland, to Italy,Germany, France, Spain and Portugal, and then crossing the western end of the Mediterranean it enteredNorth Africa, and with Carthage as a centre spread east and west along the coast. Wherever the cult of Isiscame men accepted it as something which supplied what they thought to be lacking in their native cults; richand poor, gentle and simple, all welcomed it, and the philosopher as well as the ignorant man rejoiced in thehope of a future life which it gave to them. Its Egyptian origin caused it to be regarded with the profoundestinterest, and its priests were most careful to make the temples of Isis quite different from those of the nationalgods, and to decorate them with obelisks, sphinxes, shrines, altars, etc., which were either imported fromtemples in Egypt, or were copied from Egyptian originals. In the temples of Isis services were held atdaybreak and in the early afternoon daily, and everywhere these were attended by crowds of people. The holywater used in the libations and for sprinkling the people was Nile water, specially imported from Egypt, and toLegends Of The GodsIX.

The festivals and processions of Isis were everywhere most popular,and were enjoyed by learned and unlearned alike. In fact, the Isis−play which was acted annually inNovember, and the festival of the blessing of the ship, which took place in the spring, were the most importantfestivals of the year. Curiously enough, all the oldest gods and goddesses of Egypt passed into absoluteoblivion, with the exception of Osiris (Sarapis), Isis, Anubis the physician, and Harpokrates, the child ofOsiris and Isis, and these, from being the ancestral spirits of a comparatively obscure African tribe in earlydynastic times, became for several hundreds of years the principal objects of worship of some of the mostcultured and intellectual nations. The treatise of Plutarch De Iside helps to explain how this came about, andfor those who study the Egyptian Legend of Isis and Osiris the work has considerable importance.THE HISTORY OF CREATION—A.THE BOOK OF KNOWING THE EVOLUTIONS[FN#49] OF RA, AND OF OVERTHROWING APEP.[FN#49] Kheperu.

The sky (or heaven) had notcome into being, the earth did not exist, and the children of the earth[FN#50], and the creeping, things, hadnot been made at that time. I myself raised them up from out of Nu[FN#51], from a state of helpless inertness.I found no place whereon I could stand. I worked a charm[FN#52] upon my own heart (or, will), I laid thefoundation [of things] by Maat,[FN#53] and I made everything which had form. I was [then] one by myself,for I had not emitted from myself the god Shu, and I had not spit out from myself the goddess Tefnut; andthere existed no other who could work with me.

I was ONE: by myself, and there was no other being who worked with me in that place. I made allthe things under the forms of which I appeared then by means of the Soul−God which I raised into firmness atthat time from out of Nu, from a state of inactivity. I found no place whatsoever there whereon I could stand, Iworked by the power of a spell by means of my heart, I laid a foundation [for things] before me, andwhatsoever was made, I made.

Now behold, they brought my Eye to me after two henperiods since the time when they went forth from me. I gathered together my members which had appeared inmy own body, and afterwards I had union with my hand, and my heart (or, will) came unto me from out of myhand, and the seed fell into my mouth, and I emitted from myself the gods Shu and Tefnut, and so from beingthe ONE god (or, the only, god) I became three gods; thus the two other gods who came into being on thisearth sprang from me, and Shu and Tefnut rejoiced (or, were raised up) from out of Nu in which they were.My father Nu saith:— They covered up (or, concealed) my Eye with the plant−like clouds which were behindthem (i.e., Shu and Tefnut) for very many hen periods.

Now men and women were speakingwords of complaint, saying:—“Behold, his Majesty (Life, Strength, and Health to him!) hath grown old, andhis bones have become like silver, and his members have turned into gold and his hair is like unto reallapis−lazuli.” His Majesty heard the words of complaint which men and women were uttering, and hisMajesty (Life, Strength, and Health to him!) said unto those who were in his train:—“Cry out, and bring to memy Eye, and Shu, and Tefnut, and Seb, and Nut, and the father−gods, and the mother−gods who were withme, even when I was in Nu side by side with my god Nu. Let there be brought along with my Eye hisministers, and let them be led to me hither secretly, so that men and women may not perceive them [coming]hither, and may not therefore take to flight with their hearts.

And the gods spake in the presence of his Majesty, saying:—“Speak unto us, forwe are listening to them” (i.e., thy words). Then Ra spake unto Nu, saying:—“O thou first−born god fromwhom I came into being, O ye gods of ancient time, my ancestors, take ye heed to what men and women [aredoing]; for behold, those who were created by my Eye are uttering words of complaint against me. Tell mewhat ye would do in the matter, and consider this thing for me, and seek out [a plan] for me, for I will not slaythem until I have heard what ye shall say to me concerning it.”[FN#58] The god here addressed appears to have been Nu.Then the Majesty of Nu, to son Ra, spake, saying:—“Thou art the god who art greater than he who made thee,thou art the sovereign of those who were created with thee, thy throne is set, and the fear of thee is great; letthine Eye go against those who have uttered blasphemies against thee.” And the Majesty of Ra,said:—“Behold, they have betaken themselves to flight into the mountain lands, for their hearts are afraidbecause of the words which they have uttered.” Then the gods spake in the presence of his Majesty,saying:—“Let thine Eye go forth and let it destroy for thee those who revile thee with words of evil, for thereis no eye whatsoever that can go before it and resist thee and it when it journeyeth in the form of Hathor.”Thereupon this goddess went forth and slew the men and the women who were on the mountain (or, desertland). And the Majesty of this god said, “Come, come in peace, O Hathor, for the work is accomplished.”Then this goddess said, “Thou hast made me to live, for when I gained the mastery over men and women itwas sweet to my heart;” and the Majesty of Ra said, “I myself will be master over them as [their] king, and Iwill destroy them.” And it came to pass that Sekhet of the offerings waded about in the night season in theirblood, beginning at Suten−henen.[FN#59] Then the Majesty of Ra, spake [saying], “Cry out, and let therecome to me swift and speedy messengers who shall be able to run like the wind . . . .;” and straightwaymessengers of this kind were brought unto him.

Now they made seven thousand vessels of beer. Now when the Majesty of Re,the King of the South and North, had come with the gods to look at the vessels of beer, and behold, thedaylight had appeared after the slaughter of men and women by the goddess in their season as she sailed upthe river, the Majesty of Ra said, “It is good, it is good, nevertheless I must protect men and women againsther.” And Ra, said, “Let them take up the vases and carry them to the place where the men and women wereslaughtered by her.” Then the Majesty of the King of the South and North in the three−fold beauty of the nightcaused to be poured out these vases of beer which make [men] to lie down (or, sleep), and the meadows of theFour Heavens[FN#61] were filled with beer (or, water) by reason of the Souls of the Majesty of this god.

Behold, the goddess Isis lived in the form, of a woman, who had the knowledge ofwords [of power]. Her heart turned away in disgust from the millions of men, and she chose for herself themillions of the gods, but esteemed more highly the millions of the spirits. Was it not possible to become evenas was Ra in heaven and upon earth, and to make [herself] mistress of the earth, and a [mighty] goddess—thusshe meditated in her heart—by the knowledge of the Name of the holy god? Behold, Ra entered [heaven] eachday at the head of his mariners, establishing himself upon the double throne of the two horizons. Now thedivine one had become old, he dribbled at the mouth, and he let his emissions go forth from him upon theearth, and his spittle fell upon the ground. This Isis kneaded in her hand,[FN#66] with [some] dust, and shefashioned it in the form of a sacred serpent, and made it to have the form of a dart, so that none might be ableto escape alive from it, and she left it lying upon the road whereon the great god travelled, according to hisdesire, about the two lands. Then the holy god rose up in the tabernacle of the gods in the great double house(life, strength, health!) among those who were in his train, and [as] he journeyed on his way according to hisLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"daily wont, the holy serpent shot its fang into him, and the living fire was departing from the god's own body,and the reptile destroyed the dweller among the cedars. And the mighty god opened his mouth, and the cry ofHis Majesty (life, strength, health!) reached unto the heavens, and the company of the gods said, “What is it?”and his gods said, “What is the matter?” And the god found [no words] wherewith to answer concerninghimself. His jaws shook, his lips trembled, and the poison took possession of all his flesh just as Hapi (i.e., theNile) taketh possession of the land through which he floweth. Then the great god made firm his heart (i.e.,took courage) and he cried out to those who were in his following:—“Come ye unto me, O ye who have comeinto being from my members,[FN#67] ye gods who have proceeded from me, for I would make you to knowwhat hath happened. I have been smitten by some deadly thing, of which my heart hath no knowledge, andwhich I have neither seen with my eyes nor made with my hand; and I have no knowledge at all who hathdone this to me. I have never before felt any pain like unto it, and no pain can be worse than this [is]. I am aPrince, the son of a Prince, and the divine emanation which was produced from a god. I am a Great One, theson of a Great One, and my father hath determined for me my name. I have multitudes of names, and I havemultitudes of forms, and my being existeth in every god. I have been invoked (or, proclaimed?) by Temu andHeru−Hekennu. My father and my mother uttered my name, and [they] hid it in my body at my birth so thatnone of those who would use against me words of power might succeed in making their enchantments havedominion over me.[FN#68] I had come forth from my tabernacle to look upon that which I had made, and wasmaking my way through the two lands which I had made, when a blow was aimed at me, but I know not ofwhat kind. Behold, is it fire? Behold, is it water? My heart is full of burning fire, my limbs are shivering, andmy members have darting pains in them. Let there be brought unto me my children the gods, who possesswords of magic, whose mouths are cunning [in uttering them], and whose powers reach up to heaven.” Thenhis children came unto him, and every god was there with his cry of lamentation; and Isis[FN#69] came withher words of magic, and the place of her mouth [was filled with] the breath of life, for the words which sheputteth together destroy diseases, and her words make to live those whose throats are choked (i.e., the dead).And she said, “What is this, O divine father? What is it? Hath a serpent shot his venom into thee? Hath a thingwhich thou hast fashioned lifted up its head against thee? Verily it shall be overthrown by beneficent words ofpower, and I will make it to retreat in the sight of thy rays.” The holy god opened his mouth, [saying], I wasgoing along the road and passing through the two lands of my country, for my heart wished to look upon whatI had made, when I was bitten by a serpent which I did not see; behold, is it fire? Behold, is it water? I amcolder than water, I am hotter than fire, all my members sweat, I myself quake, mine eye is unsteady. I cannotlook at the heavens, and water forceth itself on my face as in the time of the Inundation.”[FN#70] And Isissaid unto Ra, “O my divine father, tell me thy name, for he who is able to pronounce his name liveth.” [AndRa said], “I am the maker of the heavens and the earth, I have knit together the mountains, and I have createdeverything which existeth upon them. I am the maker of the Waters, and I have made Meht−ur to come intobeing; I have made the Bull of his Mother, and I have made the joys of love to exist. I am the maker ofheaven, and I have made to be hidden the two gods of the horizon, and I have placed the souls of the godswithin them. I am the Being who openeth his eyes and the light cometh; I am the Being who shutteth his eyesand there is darkness. I am the Being who giveth the command, and the waters of Hapi (the Nile) burst forth, Iam the Being whose name the gods know not. I am the maker of the hours and the creator of the days. I amthe opener (i.e., inaugurator) of the festivals, and the maker of the floods of water. I am the creator of the fireof life whereby the works of the houses are caused to come into being. I am Khepera in the morning, and Ra(at the time of his culmination (i.e., noon), and Temu in the evening.”[FN#71] Nevertheless the poison wasnot driven from its course, and the great god felt no better. Then Isis said unto Ra, “Among the things whichthou hast said unto me thy name hath not been mentioned. O declare thou it unto me, and the poison shallcome forth; for the person who hath declared his name shall live.” Meanwhile the poison burned with blazingfire and the heat thereof was stronger than that of a blazing flame. Then the Majesty of Ra, said, “I will allowmyself to be searched through by Isis, and my name shall come forth from my body and go into hers.” Thenthe divine one hid himself from the gods, and the throne in the Boat of Millions of Years[FN#72] was empty.And it came to pass that when it was the time for the heart to come forth [from the god], she said unto her sonHorus, “The great god shall bind himself by an oath to give his two eyes.”[FN#73] Thus was the great godmade to yield up his name, and Isis, the great lady of enchantments, said, “Flow on, poison, and come forthLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"from Ra; let the Eye of Horus come forth from the god and shine(?) outside his mouth. I have worked, and Imake the poison to fall on the ground, for the venom hath been mastered. Verily the name hath been takenaway from the great god.

Andsimilarly, a certain man, the son of a certain man, shall live and the poison shall die.” These were the wordswhich spake Isis, the great lady, the mistress of the gods, and she had knowledge of Ra in his own name. Theabove words shall be said over an image of Temu and an image of Heru−Hekennu,[FN#74] and over an imageof Isis and an image of Horus.[FN#66] Here we have another instance of the important part which the spittle played in magical ceremoniesthat were intended to produce evil effects. The act of spitting, however, was intended sometimes to carry acurse with it, and sometimes a blessing, for a man spat in the face of his enemy in order to lay the curse ofimpurity upon him, and at the present time, men spit upon money to keep the devils away from it.[FN#67] The gods were, according to one belief, nothing more than the various names of Ra, who had takenthe forms of the various members of his body.[FN#68] Thus the god's own name became his most important talisman.[FN#69] The position of Isis as the “great enchantress” is well defined, and several instances of her magicalpowers are recorded. By the utterance of her words of power she succeeded in raising her dead husband Osiristo life, and she enabled him by their means to beget Horus of her. Nothing could withstand them, because theywere of divine origin, and she had learned them from Thoth, the intelligence of the greatest of the gods.[FN#70] Or, “the period of the summer.” The season Shemmu, began soon after the beginning of April andlasted until nearly the end of July.[FN#71] Khepera, Rd, and Temu were the three principal forms of the Sun−god according to the theologicalsystem of the priests of Heliopolis.[FN#72] The name by which the Boat of Ra is generally known in Egyptian texts. It was this boat which wasstopped in its course when Thoth descended from the sky to impart to Isis the words of power that were toraise her dead child Horus to life.[FN#73] i.e., the fluid of life of the sun, and the fluid of life of the moon. The sun and the moon were thevisible, material symbols of the Sun god.[FN#74] The attributes of this god are not well defined. He was a god of the Eastern Delta, and was associatedwith the cities where Temu was worshipped.THE LEGEND OF HORUS OF BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.XII. In the three hundred and sixty−third year of Ra−Heru−Khuti, who liveth for ever and forever, HisMajesty was in Ta−Kens,[FN#75] and his soldiers were with him; [the enemy] did not conspire (auu) againsttheir lord, and the land [is called] Uauatet unto this day.

Then the Majesty of Ra Harmachis said unto thy divine KA, “O Heru−Behutet, O son of Ra, thouexalted one, who didst proceed from me, overthrow thou the enemies who are before thee straightway.” AndHeru−Behutet flew up into the horizon in the form of the great Winged Disk, for which reason he is called“Great god, lord of heaven,” unto this day. And when he saw the enemies in the heights of heaven he set outto follow after them in the form of the great Winged Disk, and he attacked with such terrific force those whoopposed him, that they could neither see with their eyes nor hear with their ears, and each of them slew hisfellow. In a moment of time there was not a single creature left alive. Then Heru Behutet, shining with verymany colours, came in the form of the great Winged Disk to the Boat of Ra− Harmachis, and Thoth said untoRa, “O Lord of the gods, Behutet hath returned in the form of the great Winged Disk, shining [with manycolours] . . . . . . children;” for this reason he is called Heru− Behutet unto this day. And Thoth said, “The cityTeb shall be called the city of Heru−Behutet,” and thus is it called unto this day.

Then said Ra to Heru− Behutet, “There is sweet life in this place,”and for this reason the abode of the palace of Heru−Behutet is called “Sweet Life” unto this day. And Ra, saidunto Thoth, “[Here was the slaughter] of mine enemies; “and the place is called Teb[FN#79] unto this day.And Thoth said unto Heru−Behutet, “Thou art a great protector (makaa);” and the Boat of Heru−Behutet iscalled Makaa[FN#80] unto this day. Then said Ra unto the gods who were in his following, “Behold now, letus sail in our boat upon the water, for our hearts are glad because our enemies have been overthrown on theearth;” and the water where the great god sailed is called P−Khen−Ur[FN#81] unto this day. And behold theenemies [of Ra] rushed into the water, and they took the forms of [crocodiles and] hippopotami, butnevertheless Ra−Heru−Khuti sailed over the waters in his boat, and when the crocodiles and the hippopotamihad come nigh unto him, they opened wide their jaws in order to destroy Ra−Heru−Khuti. And whenHeru−Behutet arrived and his followers who were behind him in the forms of workers in metal, each havingin his hands an iron spear and a chain, according to his name, they smote the crocodiles and the hippopotami;and there were brought in there straightway six hundred and fifty−one crocodiles, which had been slain beforethe city of Edfu. Then spake Ra−Harmachis unto Heru− Behutet, “My Image shall be [here] in the land of theSouth, (which is a house of victory (or, strength); “and the House of Heru−Behutet is called Nekht−Het untothis day.[FN#76] i.e., Apollinopolis, the modern Edfu.[FN#77] i.e. drops of blood.[FN#78] i.e., from the city.[FN#79] i.e., Edfu.[FN#80] i.e., Great Protector.[FN#81] i.e., “Great Canal.”XIV.

And Heru−Behutet was at theback (or, side) of them in the Boat of Ra, and there were in his hands a metal lance and a metal chain; and themetal workers who were with their lord were equipped for fighting with lances and chains. And Heru−Behutetsaw them[FN#84] to the south−east of the city of Uast (Thebes) some distance away. Then Ra said to Thoth,“Those enemies shall be smitten with blows that kill;” and Thoth said to Ra, “[That place] is called the cityTchet−Met unto this day.” And Heru−Behutet made a great overthrow among them, and Ra said, “Stand still,O Heru−Behutet,” and [that place] is called “Het−Ra” to this day, and the god who dwelleth therein isHeru−Behutet−Ra−Amsu (or, Min).

And Heru−Behutet followed them, being equipped with all his weapons of war to fightagainst them. And Heru−Behutet made a journey in the Boat of Ra, together with the great god who was in hisboat with those who were his followers, and he pursued them on the Lake of the North twice, and passed oneday and one night sailing down the river in pursuit of them before he perceived and overtook them, for heknew not the place where they were. Then he arrived at the city of Per−Rehu. And the Majesty of Ra said untoHeru−Behutet, “What hath happened to the enemies? They have gathered together themselves in the water tothe west (?) of the nome of Mertet in order to unite themselves with the enemies [who serve] Set, and who arein this region, at the place where are our staff and sceptre.” And Thoth said unto Ra, “Uast in the nome ofMertet is called Uaseb because of this unto this day, and the Lake which is in it is called Tempt.” ThenHeru−Behutet spake in the presence of his father Ra, saying, “I beseech thee to set thy boat against them, sothat I may be able to perform against them that which Ra willeth;” and this was done. Then he made an attackupon them on the Lake which was at the west of this district, and he perceived them on the bank of the city . .. . . . which belongeth to the Lake of Mertet. Then Heru−Behutet made an expedition against them, and hisfollowers were with him, and they were provided with weapons of all kinds for battle, and he wrought a greatoverthrow among them, and he brought in three hundred and eighty−one enemies, and he slaughtered them inthe forepart of the Boat of Ra, and he gave one of them to each of those who were in his train. Then Set roseup and came forth, and raged loudly with words of cursing and abuse because of the things whichHeru−behutet had done in respect of the slaughter of the enemies. And Ra said unto Thoth, “This fiendNehaha−hra uttereth words at the top of his voice because of the things which Heru−Behutet hath done untohim;” and Thoth said unto Ra, “Cries of this kind shall be called Nehaha−hra unto this day.” AndHeru−Behutet did battle with the Enemy for a period of time, and he hurled his iron lance at him, and hethrow him down on the ground in this region, which is called Pa−Rerehtu unto this day. Then Heru−Behutetcame and brought the Enemy with him, and his spear was in his neck, and his chain was round his hands andarms, and the weapon of Horus had fallen on his mouth and had closed it; and he went with him before hisfather Ra, who said, “O Horus, thou Winged Disk, twice great (Urui−Tenten) is the deed of valour which thouhast done, and thou hast cleansed the district.” And Ra, said unto Thoth, “The palace of Heru−Behutet shallbe called, 'Lord of the district which is cleansed' because of this;” and [thus is it called] unto this day. And thename of the priest thereof is called Ur−Tenten unto this day. And Ra said unto Thoth, “Let the enemies andSet be given over to Isis and her son Horus, and let them work all their heart's desire upon them.” And she andher son Horus set themselves in position with their spears in him at the time when there was storm (or,disaster) in the district, and the Lake of the god was called She−En−Aha from that day to this. Then Horus theson of Isis cut off the head of the Enemy [Set], and the heads of his fiends in the presence of father Ra and ofthe great company of the gods, and he dragged him by his feet through his district with his spear driventhrough his head and back. And Ra said unto Thoth, “Let the son of Osiris drag the being of disaster throughhis territory;” and Thoth said, “It shall be called Ateh,” and this hath been the name of the region from thatday to this. And Isis, the divine lady, spake before Ra, saying, “Let the exalted Winged Disk become theamulet of my son Horus, who hath cut off the head of the Enemy and the heads of his fiends.”[FN#85] i.e., the Mediterranean.XVI. Thus Heru−Behutet and Horus, the son of Isis, slaughtered that evil Enemy, and his fiends, and the inertfoes, and came forth with them to the water on the west side of this district.

And Horus, the son of Isis, transformed himself into a similar shape, even asHeru−Behutet had done before him. And they slew the enemies all together on the west of Per−Rehu, on theedge of the stream, and this god hath sailed over the water wherein the enemies had banded themselvesto−ether against him from that day to this.

And Ra said, “Set hath taken upon himself the form of a hissing serpent. Let Horus, the son ofIsis, in the form of a hawk−headed staff, set himself over the place where he is, so that the serpent may nevermore appear.” And Thoth said, “Let this district be called Hemhemet[FN#86] by name;\" and thus hath it beencalled from that day to this.

Beholdthe god Thoth, the great god, the Chief of Maat[FN#203] [both] in heaven and on the earth, said unto me,“Come now, O Isis, thou goddess, moreover it is a good thing to hearken,[FN#204] [for there is] life to onewho shall be guided [by the advice] of another.

Two scorpions, Tefen and Befen, were behindme, two scorpions, Mestet and Mestetef, were by my side, and three scorpions, Petet, Thetet, and Maatet (or,Martet), were for preparing the road for me. I charged them very strictly (or, in a loud voice), and my wordspenetrated into their ears: “Have no knowledge of [any], make no cry to the Tesheru beings, and pay noattention to the 'son of a man' (i.e., anyone) who belongeth to a man of no account,” [and I said,] “Let yourfaces be turned towards the ground [that ye may show me] the way.” So the guardian of the company broughtme to the boundaries of the city of Pa−Sui,[FN#209] the city of the goddesses of the Divine Sandals, [whichwas situated] in front of the Papyrus Swamps.[FN#210][FN#209] “The House of the Crocodile,” perhaps the same town as Pa−Sebekt, a district in the VIIth nome ofLower Egypt (Metelites).[FN#210] Perhaps a district in the Metelite nome.When I had arrived at the place where the people lived[FN#211] I came to the houses wherein dwelt the wives[and] husbands. And a certain woman of quality spied me as I was journeying along the road, and she shut herdoors on me. Now she was sick at heart by reason of those [scorpions] which were with me. Then [the SevenScorpions] took counsel concerning her, and they all at one time shot out their venom on the tail of thescorpion Tefen; as for me, the woman Taha[FN#212] opened her door, and I entered into the house of themiserable lady.[FN#211] In Egyptian Teb, which may be the Tebut in the Metelite nome.[FN#212] Taha may be the name of a woman, or goddess, or the word may mean a “dweller in the swamps,”as Golenischeff thinks.Then the scorpion Tefen entered in under the leaves of the door and smote (i.e., stung) the son of Usert, and afire broke out in the house of Usert, and there was no water there to extinguish it; [but] the sky rained uponthe house of Usert, though it was not the season for rain.[FN#213][FN#213] i.e., it was not the season of the inundation.Behold, the heart of her who had not opened her door to me was grievously sad, for she knew not whether he(i.e., her son) would live [or not], and although she went round about through her town uttering cries [forhelp], there was none who came at [the sound of] her voice. Now mine own heart was grievously sad for thesake of the child, and [I wished] to make to live [again] him that was free from fault. [Thereupon] I cried outLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"to the noble lady, “Come to me. Come to me. Verily my mouth (?) possesseth life. I am a daughter [well]known in her town, [and I] can destroy the demon of death by the spell (or, utterance) which my father taughtme to know. I am his daughter, the beloved [offspring] of his body.”Then Isis placed her two hands on the child in order to make to live him whose throat was stopped, [and shesaid], “O poison of the scorpion Tefent, come forth and appear on the ground! Thou shalt neither enter norpenetrate [further into the body of the child]. O poison of the scorpion Befent, come forth and appear on theground! I am Isis, the goddess, the lady (or, mistress) of words of power, and I am the maker of words ofpower (i.e., spells), and I know how to utter words with magical effect.[FN#214] Hearken ye unto me, Oevery reptile which possesseth the power to bite (i.e., to sting), and fall headlong to the ground!

O poison of the scorpions Petet and Thetet, penetrate not [into his body]. [O poison of] the scorpionMaatet (or, Martet), fall down on the ground.”[FN#214] By uttering spells Isis restored life to her husband Osiris for a season, and so became with child byhim. She made a magical figure of a reptile, and having endowed it with life, it stung Ra as he passed throughthe sky, and the great god almost died. In Greek times it was believed that she discovered a medicine whichwould raise the dead, and she was reputed to be a great expert in the art of healing men's sicknesses. As agoddess she appeared to the sick, and cured them.[Here follows the] “Chapter of the stinging [of scorpions].”And Isis, the goddess, the great mistress of spells (or, words of power), she who is at the head of the gods,unto whom the god Keb gave his own magical spells for the driving away of poison at noon−day (?), and formaking poison to go back, and retreat, and withdraw, and go backward, spake, saying, “Ascend not intoheaven, through the command of the beloved one of Ra, the egg of the Smen goose which cometh forth fromthe sycamore. Verily my words are made to command the uttermost limit of the night. I speak unto you, [Oscorpions] I am alone and in sorrow because our names will suffer disgrace throughout the nomes.

Now the lady Usert suffered pain andanguish the whole night, and her mouth tasted (i.e., felt) the sting [which] her son [had suffered]. And shebrought her possessions as the penalty for not having opened the door to me. Oh the child shall live and thepoison die! Verily Horus shall be in good case for his mother Isis.

Though it be the wise man's duty, O Clea,[FN#259] to apply to the gods for every good thing which hehopes to enjoy, yet ought he more especially to pray to them for their assistance in his search after thatknowledge which more immediately regards themselves, as far as such knowledge may be attained, inasmuchas there is nothing which they can bestow more truly beneficial to mankind, or more worthy themselves, thantruth. For whatever other good things are indulged to the wants of men, they have all, properly speaking, norelation to, and are of a nature quite different from, that of their divine donors. For 'tis not the abundance ofLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"their gold and silver, nor the command of the thunder, but wisdom and knowledge which constitute the powerand happiness of those heavenly beings. It is therefore well observed by Homer (Iliad, xiii. 354), and indeedwith more propriety than be usually talks of the gods, when, speaking of Zeus and Poseidon, he tells us thatboth were descended from the same parents, and born in the same region, but that Zeus was the elder andknew most; plainly intimating thereby that the empire of the former was more august and honourable than thatof his brother, as by means of his age he was his superior, and more advanced in wisdom and science. Nay, 'tismy opinion, I own, that even the blessedness of that eternity which is the portion of the Deity himself consistsin that universal knowledge of all nature which accompanies it; for setting this aside, eternity might be moreproperly styled an endless duration than an enjoyment of existence.[FN#259] She is said to have been a priestess of Isis and of Apollo Delphicus.II. To desire, therefore, and covet after truth, those truths more especially which concern the divine nature, isto aspire to be partakers of that nature itself, and to profess that all our studies and inquiries are devoted to theacquisition of holiness. This occupation is surely more truly religious than any external purifications or mereservice of the temple can be. But more especially must such a disposition of mind be highly acceptable to thatgoddess to whose service you are dedicated, for her especial characteristics are wisdom and foresight, and hervery name seems to express the peculiar relation which she bears to knowledge. For “Isis\"[FN#260] is aGreek word, and means “knowledge,” and “Typhon,”[FN#261] the name of her professed adversary, is also aGreek word, and means “pride and insolence.” This latter name is well adapted to one who, full of ignoranceand error, tears in pieces and conceals that holy doctrine which the goddess collects, compiles, and delivers tothose who aspire after the most perfect participation in the divine nature. This doctrine inculcates a steadyperseverance in one uniform and temperate course of life, and an abstinence from particular kinds of foods, aswell as from all indulgence of the carnal appetite, and it restrains the intemperate and voluptuous part withindue bounds, and at the same time habituates her votaries to undergo those austere and rigid ceremonies whichtheir religion obliges them to observe. The end and aim of all these toils and labours is the attainment of theknowledge of the First and Chief Being, who alone is the object of the understanding of the mind; and thisknowledge the goddess invites us to seek after, as being near and dwelling continually with her. And this alsois what the very name of her temple promiseth to us, that is to say, the knowledge and understanding of theeternal and self−existent Being (tou ontas)−now, it is called “Iseion,” which suggests that if we approach thetemple of the goddess rightly, and with purity, we shall obtain the knowledge of that eternal and self−existentBeing (to on).[FN#260] The Egyptian form of the name is As−T, ####, ####, or ####. Plutarch wishes to derive the namefrom some form of {greek oida}.[FN#261] In Egyptian, Tebh.III. The goddess Isis is said by some authors to be the daughter[FN#262] of Hermes, [FN#263] and by othersof Prometheus, both of them famous for their philosophic turn of mind. The latter is supposed to have firsttaught mankind wisdom and foresight, as the former is reputed to have invented letters and music.[FN#262] According to the Egyptian Heliopolitan doctrine, Isis was the daughter of Keb, the Earth−god, andNut, the Sky−goddess; she was the wife of Osiris, mother of Horus, and sister of Set and Nephthys.[FN#263] The Egyptian.

Now, by the former of these are meant such who carry about them looked upin their souls, as in a chest, the sacred doctrine concerning the gods, purified from all such superfluities assuperstition may have added thereto. And the holy apparel with which the Hierostoli adorn the statues of thesedeities, which is partly of a dark and gloomy and partly of a more bright and shining colour, seems aptlyenough to represent the notions which this doctrine teaches us to entertain of the divine nature itself, partlyclear and partly obscure. And inasmuch as the devotees of Isis after their decease are wrapped up in thesesacred vestments, is not this intended to signify that this holy doctrine still abides with them, and that thisalone accompanies them in another life? For as 'tis not the length of the beard or the coarseness of the habitwhich makes a philosopher, so neither will these frequent shavings, or the mere wearing of a linen vestment,constitute a votary of Isis. He alone is a true servant or follower of this goddess who, after he has heard, andhas been made acquainted in a proper manner with the history of the actions of these gods, searches into thehidden truths which lie concealed under them, and examines the whole by the dictates of reason andphilosophy.[FN#264] The Hermopolis here referred to is the city of Khemenu in Upper Egypt, wherein was the greatsanctuary of Thoth.[FN#265] i.e., Righteousness, or Justice. The goddess referred to is probably Maat.IV. Nor, indeed, ought such an examination to be looked on as unnecessary whilst there are so many ignorantof the true reason even of the most ordinary rites observed by the Egyptian priests, such as theirshavings[FN#266] and wearing linen garments. Some, indeed, there are who never trouble themselves to thinkat all about these matters, whilst others rest satisfied with the most superficial accounts of them: “They pay apeculiar veneration to the sheep,[FN#267] therefore they think it their duty not only to abstain from eating itsflesh, but likewise from wearing its wool. They are continually mourning for their gods, therefore they shavethemselves. The light azure blossom of the flax resembles the clear and bloomy colour of the ethereal sky,therefore they wear linen”; whereas the true reason of the institution and observation of these rites is but one,and that common to all of them, namely, the extraordinary notions which they entertain of cleanliness,persuaded as they are, according to the saying of Plato, “none but the pure ought to approach the pure.” Now,no superfluity of our food, and no excrementitious substance, is looked upon by them as pure and clean; such,however, are all kinds of wool and down, our hair and our nails. It would be the highest absurdity, therefore,for those who, whilst; they are in a course of purification, are at so much pains to take off the hair from everypart of their own bodies, at the same time to clothe themselves with that of other animals. So when we are toldby Hesiod “not to pare our nails whilst we are present at the festivals of the gods,”[FN#268] we ought tounderstand that he intended hereby to inculcate that purity wherewith we ought to come prepared before weenter upon any religious duty, that we have not to make ourselves clean whilst we ought to be occupied inattending to the solemnity itself. Now, with regard to flax, this springs out of the immortal earth itself; and notonly produces a fruit fit for food, but moreover furnishes a light and neat sort of clothing, extremely agreeableto the wearer, adapted to all the seasons of the year, and not in the least subject, as is said, to produce ornourish vermin; but more of this in another place.[FN#266] A rubric in the papyrus of Nes−Menu in the British Museum orders the priestesses of Isis andNephthys to have “the hair of their bodies shaved off” (No. 10,188, col. 1), but they are also ordered to wearfillets of rams' wool on their heads.[FN#267] Probably the ram of Amen. Animal sacrifices were invariably bulls and cows.[FN#268] This saying is by Pythagoras—{greek Para dusian mh`onuxizou}. The saying of Hesiod (Worksand Days, 740) is rendered by Goodwin:—Legends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"“Not at a feast of Gods from five−branched tree, With sharp−edged steel to part the green from dry.”V. Now, the priests are so scrupulous in endeavouring to avoid everything which may tend to the increase ofthe above−mentioned excrementitious substances, that, on this account, they abstain not only from most sortsof pulse, and from the flesh of sheep and swine, but likewise, in their more solemn purifications, they evenexclude salt from their meals. This they do for many reasons, but chiefly because it whets their appetites, andincites them to eat more than they otherwise would. Now, as to salt being accounted impure because, asAristagoras tells us, many little insects are caught in it whilst it is hardening, and are thereby killedtherein−this view is wholly trifling and absurd. From these same motives also they give the Apis Bull hiswater from a well specially set apart for the purpose,[FN#269] and they prevent him altogether from drinkingof the Nile, not indeed that they regard the river as impure, and polluted because of the crocodiles which are init, as some pretend, for there is nothing which the Egyptians hold in greater veneration than the Nile, butbecause its waters are observed to be particularly nourishing[FN#270] and fattening. And they strive toprevent fatness in Apis as well as in themselves, for they are anxious that their bodies should sit as light andeasy about their souls as possible, and that their mortal part should not oppress and weigh down the divine andimmortal.[FN#269] It is quite possible that Apis drank from a special well, but the water in it certainly came from theNile by infiltration. In all the old wells at Memphis the water sinks as the Nile sinks, and rises as it rises.[FN#270] On account of the large amount of animal matter contained in it.VI. The priests of the Sun at Heliopolis[FN#271] never carry wine into their temples, for they regard it asindecent for those who are devoted to the service of any god to indulge in the drinking of wine whilst they areunder the immediate inspection of their Lord and King.[FN#272] The priests of the other deities are not soscrupulous in this respect, for they use it, though sparingly. During their more solemn purifications theyabstain from wine wholly, and they give themselves up entirely to study and meditation, and to the hearingand teaching of those divine truths which treat of the divine nature. Even the kings, who are likewise priests,only partake of wine in the measure which is prescribed for them in the sacred books, as we are told byHecataeus. This custom was only introduced during the reign of Psammetichus, and before that time theydrank no wine at all. If they used it at any time in pouring out libations to the gods, it was not because theylooked upon it as being acceptable to them for its own sake, but they poured it out over their altars as theblood of their enemies who had in times past fought against them. For they believe the vine to have firstsprung out of the earth after it was fattened by the bodies of those who fell in the wars against the gods. Andthis, they say, is the reason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad and beside themselves,filling them, as it were, with the blood of their own ancestors. These things are thus related by Eudoxus in thesecond book of his Travels, as he had them from the priests themselves.[FN#271] Called ANU in the Egyptian texts; it was the centre of the great solar cult of Egypt. It is the “On” ofthe Bible.[FN#272] The Sun−god was called Ra.VII. As to sea−fish, the Egyptians in general do not abstain from all kinds of them, but some from one sortand some from another. Thus, for example, the inhabitants of Oxyrhynchus[FN#273] will not touch any thathave been taken with an angle; for as they pay especial reverence to the Oxyrhynchus Fish,[FN#274] fromwhence they derive their name, they are afraid lest perhaps the hook may be defiled by having been at sometime or other employed in catching their favourite fish. The people of Syene[FN#275] in like manner abstainfrom the Phagrus Fish[FN#276]; for as this fish is observed by them to make his first appearance upon theircoasts just as the Nile begins to overflow, they pay special regard to these voluntary messengers as it were ofthat most joyful news. The priests, indeed, entirely abstain from all sorts in general.[FN#277] Therefore, uponLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the ninth day of the first month, when all the rest of the Egyptians are obliged by their religion to eat a friedfish before the door of their houses, they only burn them, not tasting them at all. For this custom they give tworeasons: the first and most curious, as falling in with the sacred philosophy of Osiris and Typhon, will be moreproperly explained in another place. The second, that which is most obvious and manifest, is that fish isneither a dainty nor even a necessary kind of food, a fact which seems to be abundantly confirmed by thewritings of Homer, who never makes either the delicate Pheacians or the Ithacans (though both peoples wereislanders) to feed upon fish, nor even the companions of Ulysses during their long and most tedious voyage,till they were reduced thereto by extreme necessity. In short, they consider the sea to have been forced out ofthe earth by the power of fire, and therefore to lie out of nature's confines; and they regard it not as a part ofthe world, or one of the elements, but as a preternatural and corrupt and morbid excrement.[FN#273] The Per−Matchet.[FN#274] Probably the pike, or “fighting fish.”[FN#275] In Egyptian, SUNU, the Seweneh of the Bible, and the modern Aswan.[FN#276] A kind of bream, the an of the Egyptian texts.[FN#277] Compare Chap. CXXXVIIA of the Book of the Dead. “And behold, these things shall be performedby a man who is clean, and is ceremonially pure, one who hath eaten neither meat nor fish, and who hath nothad intercourse with women” (ll. 52, 53).VIII. This much may be depended upon: the, religious rites and ceremonies of the Egyptians were neverinstituted upon irrational grounds, never built upon mere fable and superstition, but founded with a view topromote the morality and happiness of those who were to observe them, or at least to preserve the memory ofsome valuable piece of history, or to represent to us some of the phenomena of nature. As concerning theabhorrence which is expressed for onions, it is wholly improbable that this detestation is owing to the loss ofDiktys, who, whilst he was under the guardianship of Isis, is supposed to have fallen into the river and to havebeen drowned as he was reaching after a bunch of them. No, the true reason of their abstinence from onions isbecause they are observed to flourish most and to be in the greatest vigour at the wane of the moon, and alsobecause they are entirely useless to them either in their feasts[FN#278] or in their times of abstinence andpurification, for in the former case they make tears come from those who use them, and in the latter theycreate thirst. For much the same reason they likewise look upon the pig as an impure animal, and to beavoided, observing it to be most apt to engender upon the decrease of the moon, and they think that those whodrink its milk are more subject to leprosy and such−like cutaneous diseases than others. The custom ofabstaining from the flesh of the pig[FN#279] is not always observed, for those who sacrifice a sow to Typhononce a year, at the full moon, afterwards eat its flesh. The reason they give for this practice is this: Typhonbeing in pursuit of this animal at that season of the moon, accidentally found the wooden chest wherein wasdeposited the body of Osiris, which he immediately pulled to pieces. This story, however, is not generallyadmitted, there being some who look upon it, as they do many other relations of the same kind, as foundedupon some mistake or misrepresentation. All agree, however, in saying that so great was the abhorrence whichthe ancient Egyptians expressed for whatever tended to promote luxury, expense, and voluptuousness, that inorder to expose it as much as possible they erected a column in one of the temples of Thebes, full of cursesagainst their king Meinis, who first drew them off from their former frugal and parsimonious course of life.The immediate cause for the erection of the pillar is thus given: Technatis,[FN#280] the father of Bocchoris,leading an army against the Arabians, and his baggage and provisions not coming up to him as soon as heexpected, was therefore obliged to eat some of the very poor food which was obtainable, and having eaten, helay down on the bare ground and slept very soundly. This gave him a great affection for a mean and frugaldiet, and induced him to curse the memory of Meinis, and with the permission of the priests he made thesecurses public by cutting them upon a pillar.[FN#281]Legends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"[FN#278] Bunches of onions were offered to the dead at all periods of Egyptian history, and they wereregarded as typical of the “white teeth” of Horus. The onion was largely used in medicine.[FN#279] The pig was associated with Set, or Typhon, and the black variety was specially abominatedbecause it was a black pig which struck Horus in the eye, and damaged it severely. See Book of the Dead,Chap. CXII.[FN#280] In Egyptian, TAFNEKHT, the first king of the XXIVth Dynasty.[FN#281] An unlikely story, for Tafnekht had no authority at Thebes.IX. Now, the kings of Egypt were always chosen either out of the soldiery or priesthood, the former orderbeing honoured and respected for its valour, and the latter for its wisdom. If the choice fell upon a soldier, hewas immediately initiated into the order of priests, and by them instructed in their abstruse and hiddenphilosophy, a philosophy for the most part involved in fable and allegory, and exhibiting only dark hints andobscure resemblances of the truth. This the priesthood hints to us in many instances, particularly by thesphinxes, which they seem to have placed designedly before their temples as types of the enigmatical natureof their theology. To this purpose, likewise, is that inscription which they have engraved upon the base of thestatue of Athene[FN#282] at Sais, whom they identify with Isis: “I am everything that has been, that is, andthat shall be: and my veil no man hath raised.” In like manner the word “Amoun,” or as it is expressed in theGreek language, “Ammon,” which is generally looked upon as the proper name of the Egyptian Zeus, isinterpreted by Manetho[FN#283] the Sebennite[FN#284] to signify “concealment” or “something which ishidden.”[FN#285] Hecataeus of Abdera indeed tells us that the Egyptians make use of this term when theycall out to one another. If this be so, then their invoking Amoun is the same thing as calling upon the supremebeing, whom they believe to be “hidden” and “concealed” in the universal nature, to appear and manifest itselfto them. So cautious and reserved was the Egyptian wisdom in those things which appertained to religion.[FN#282] The Egyptian goddess Net, in Greek {greek Nhid}, the great goddess of Sais, in the Western Delta.She was self−existent, and produced her son, the Sun−god, without union with a god. In an address to her,quoted by Mallet (Culte de Neit, p. 140), are found the words, “thy garment hath not been unloosed,” thusPlutarch's quotation is correct.[FN#283] He compiled a History of Egypt for Ptolemy II., and flourished about B.C. 270; only the King−Listfrom this work is preserved.[FN#284] He was a native of the town of Sebennytus.[FN#285] Amen means “hidden,” and AMEN is the “hidden god.”X. And this is still farther evinced from those voyages which have been made into Egypt by the wisest menamong the Greeks, namely, by Solo, Thales Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and, as some say, even by Lycurgushimself, on purpose to converse with the priests. And we are also told that Eudoxus was a disciple ofChnouphis the Memphite, Solo of Sonchis the Saite, and Pythagoras of Oinuphis the Heliopolite. But none ofthese philosophers seems either to have been more admired and in greater favour with the priests, or to havepaid a more especial regard to their method of philosophising, than this last named, who has particularlyimitated their mysterious and symbolical manner in his own writings, and like them conveyed his doctrines tothe world in a kind of riddle. For many of the precepts of Pythagoras come nothing short of the hieroglyphicalrepresentations themselves, such as, “eat not in a chariot,” “sit not on a measure (choenix),” “plant not apalm−tree,” and “stir not the fire with a sword in the house.” And I myself am of the opinion that, when thePythagoreans appropriated the names of several of the gods to particular numbers, as that of Apollo to theunit, of Artemis to the duad, of Athene to the seven, and of Poseidon to the first cube, in this they allude toLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.69"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"something which the founder of their sect saw in the Egyptian temples, or to some ceremonies performed inthem, or to some symbols there exhibited. Thus, their great king and lord Osiris is represented by thehieroglyphics for an eye and a sceptre,[FN#286] the name itself signifying “many−eyed,” as we are told bysome[FN#287] who would derive it from the words os,[FN#288] “many,” and iri,[FN#289] an “eye,” whichhave this meaning in the Egyptian language. Similarly, because the heavens are eternal and are neverconsumed or wax old, they represent them by a heart with a censer placed under it. Much in the same way arethose statues of the Judges at Thebes without hands, and their chief, or president, is represented with his eyesturned downwards, which signifies that justice ought not to be obtainable by bribes, nor guided by favour oraffection. Of a like nature is the Beetle which we see engraven upon the seals of the soldiers, for there is nosuch thing as a female beetle of this species; for they are all males, and they propagate their kind by castingtheir seed into round balls of dirt, which afford not only a proper place wherein the young may be hatched, butalso nourishment for them as soon as they are born.[FN#286] The oldest form of the name is As−Ar, ####; the first sign, ####, is a throne, and the second, ####,is an eye, but the exact meaning represented by the two signs is not known. In late times a sceptre, #### tookthe place of the throne, but only because of its phonetic value as or us. Thus we have the forms #### and####.[FN#287] This is a mistake.[FN#288] In Egyptian, #### ash, “many.”[FN#289] In Egyptian, #### art, Coptic ####, “eye.”XI. When you hear, therefore, the mythological tales which the Egyptians tell of their gods, their wanderings,their mutilations, and many other disasters which befell them, remember what has just been said, and beassured that nothing of what is thus told you is really true, or ever happened in fact. For can it be imaginedthat it is the dog[FN#290] itself which is reverenced by them under the name of Hermes[FN#291]? It is thequalities of this animal, his constant vigilance, and his acumen in distinguishing his friends from his foes,which have rendered him, as Plato says, a meet emblem of that god who is the chief patron of intelligence.Nor can we imagine that they think that the sun, like a newly born babe, springs up every day out of a lily. Itis quite true that they represent the rising sun in this manner,[FN#292] but the reason is because they wish toindicate thereby that it is moisture to which we owe the first kindling of this luminary. In like manner, thecruel and bloody king of Persia, Ochus, who not only put to death great numbers of the people, but even slewthe Apis Bull himself, and afterwards served him up in a banquet to his friends, is represented by them by asword, and by this name he is still to be found in the catalogue of their kings. This name, therefore, does notrepresent his person, but indicates his base and cruel qualities, which were best suggested by the picture of aninstrument of destruction. If, therefore, O Clea, you will hear and entertain the story of these gods from thosewho know how to explain it consistently with religion and philosophy, if you will steadily persist in theobservance of all these holy rites which the laws require of you, and are moreover fully persuaded that to formtrue notions of the divine nature is more acceptable to them than any sacrifice or mere external act of worshipcan be, you will by this means be entirely exempt from any danger of falling into superstition, an evil no lessto be avoided than atheism itself.[FN#290] The animal here referred to must be the dog−headed ape, ####, which we see in pictures of theJudgment assisting Thoth to weigh the heart of the dead. This dog−headed ape is a wonderfully intelligentcreature, and its weird cleverness is astonishing.[FN#291] The Egyptian Tehuti, or Thoth.[FN#292] ####.Legends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.70"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"XII. Now, the story of Isis and Osiris, its most insignificant and superfluous parts being omitted, runs thus:—The goddess Rhea,[FN#293] they say, having accompanied with Kronos[FN#294] by stealth, was discoveredby Helios[FN#295] who straightway cursed her, and declared that she should not be delivered in any month oryear. Hermes, however, 'being also in love with the same goddess, in return for the favours which he hadreceived from her, went and played at dice with Selene,[FN#296] and won from her the seventieth part ofeach day. These parts he joined together and made from them five complete days, and he added them to thethree hundred and sixty days of which the year formerly consisted. These five days are to this day called the“Epagomenae,”[FN#297] that is, the superadded, and they are observed by them as the birthdays of theirgods.[FN#298] On the first of these, they say, Osiris was born, and as he came into the world a voice washeard saying, “The Lord of All[FN#299] is born.” Some relate the matter in a different way, and say that acertain person named Pamyles, as he was fetching water from the temple of Dios at Thebes, heard a voicecommanding him to proclaim aloud that the good and great king Osiris was then born, and that for this reasonKronos committed the education of the child to him, and that in memory of this event the Pamylia wereafterwards instituted, which closely resemble the Phallephoria or Priapeia of the Greeks. Upon the second ofthese days was born Aroueris,[FN#300] whom some call Apollo, and others the Elder Horus. Upon the thirdday Typhon was born, who came into the world neither at the proper time nor by the right way, but he forceda passage through a wound which he made in his mother's side. Upon the fourth day Isis was born, in themarshes of Egypt,[FN#301] and upon the fifth day Nephthys, whom some call Teleute, or Aphrodite, or Nike,was born. As regards the fathers of these children, the first two are said to have been begotten by Helios, Isisby Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys by Kronos. Therefore, since the third of the superadded days was thebirthday of Typhon, the kings considered it to be unlucky,[FN#302] and in consequence they neithertransacted any business in it, nor even suffered themselves to take any refreshment until the evening. Theyfurther add that Typhon married Nephthys,[FN#303] and that Isis and Osiris, having a mutual affection,enjoyed each other in their mother's womb before they were born, and that from this commerce sprangAroueris, whom the Egyptians likewise call Horus the Elder, and the Greeks Apollo.[FN#293] i.e., Nut, the Sky−goddess.[FN#294] i.e., Keb, the Earth−god.[FN#295] i.e., Ra.[FN#296] i.e., Aah.[FN#297] In Egyptian, “the five days over the year,”[FN#298] In Egyptian thus:— I.

Osiris having become king of Egypt, applied himself to civilizing his countrymen by turning them fromtheir former indigent and barbarous course of life. He taught them how to cultivate and improve the fruits ofthe earth, and he gave them a body of laws whereby to regulate their conduct, and instructed them in thereverence and worship which they were to pay to the gods. With the same good disposition he afterwardstravelled over the rest of the world, inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, not indeedcompelling them by force of arms, but persuading them to yield to the strength of his reasons, which wereconveyed to them in the most agreeable manner, in hymns and songs, accompanied with instruments of music.From this last circumstance the Greeks identified him with their Dionysos, or Bacchus. During the absence ofOsiris from his kingdom, Typhon had no opportunity of making any innovations in the state, Isis beingextremely vigilant in the government, and always upon her guard. After his return, however, having firstpersuaded seventy− two other people to join with him in the conspiracy, together with a certain queen ofEthiopia called Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at that time, he formed a crafty plot against him. For havingprivily taken the measure of the body of Osiris, he caused a chest to be made of exactly the same size, and itwas very beautiful and highly decorated. This chest he brought into a certain banqueting room, where it wasgreatly admired by all who were present, and Typhon, as if in jest, promised to give it to that man whose bodywhen tried would be found to fit it. Thereupon the whole company, one after the other, went into it, but it didnot fit any of them; last of all Osiris himself lay down in it. Thereupon all the conspirators ran to the chest,and clapped the cover upon it, and then they fastened it down with nails on the outside, and poured meltedlead over it. They next took the chest to the river, which carried it to the sea through the Tanaitic mouth of theNile; and for this reason this mouth of the Nile is still held in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and isnever mentioned by them except with marks of detestation. These things, some say, took place on theseventeenth day of the month of Hathor, when the sun was in Scorpio, in the twenty−eighth year of the reignof Osiris, though others tell us that this was the year of his life and not of his reign.XIV. The first who had knowledge of the accident which had befallen their king were the Pans and Satyrs,who inhabited the country round about Chemmis,[FN#304] and they having informed the people about it,gave the first occasion to the name of Panic Terrors, which has ever since been made use of to signify anysudden fright or amazement of a multitude. As soon as the report reached Isis, she immediately cut off one ofthe locks of her hair, and put on mourning apparel in that very place where she happened to be; for this reasonthe place has ever since been called “Koptos,” or the “city of mourning,” though some are of opinion that thisword rather signifies “deprivation.” After this she wandered round about through the country, being full ofdisquietude and perplexity, searching for the chest, and she inquired of every person she met, including somechildren whom she saw, whether they knew what was become of it. Now, it so happened that these childrenhad seen what Typhon's accomplices had done with the body, and they accordingly told her by what mouth ofthe Nile it had been conveyed to the sea. For this reason the Egyptians look upon children as endued with akind of faculty of divining, and in consequence of this notion are very curious in observing the accidentalprattle which they have with one another whilst they are at play, especially if it be in a sacred place, formingomens and presages from it. Isis meanwhile having been informed that Osiris, deceived by her sisterNephthys, who was in love with him, had unwittingly enjoyed her instead of herself, as she concluded fromthe melilot−garland which he had left with her, made it her business likewise to search out the child, the fruitof this unlawful commerce (for her sister, dreading the anger of her husband Typhon, had exposed it as soonas it was born). Accordingly, after much pains and difficulty, by means of some dogs that conducted her to theplace where it was, she found it and bred it up; and in process of time it became her constant guard andattendant, and obtained the name of Anubis, and it is thought that it watches and guards the gods as dogs domen.[FN#304] In Egyptian, Khebt, in the VIIIth nome of Lower Egypt.XV. At length Isis received more particular news that the chest had been carried by the waves of the sea to thecoast of Byblos, and there gently lodged in the branches of a bush of tamarisk, which in a short time hadgrown up into a large and beautiful tree, and had grown round the chest and enclosed it on every side soLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"completely that it was not to be seen. Moreover, the king of the country, amazed at its unusual size, had cutthe tree down, and made that part of the trunk wherein the chest was concealed into a pillar to support the roofof his house. These things, they say, having been made known to Isis in an extraordinary manner by the reportof demons, she immediately went to Byblos, where, setting herself down by the side of a fountain, she refusedto speak to anybody except the queen's women who chanced to be there. These, however, she saluted andcaressed in the kindest manner possible, plaiting their hair for them, and transmitting into them part of thatwonderful odour which issued from her own body. This raised a great desire in the queen their mistress to seethe stranger who had this admirable faculty of transfusing so fragrant a smell from herself into the hair andskin of other people. She therefore sent for her to court, and, after a further acquaintance with her, made hernurse to one of her sons. Now, the name of the king who reigned at this time at Byblos was Melkander(Melkarth?), and that of his wife was Astarte, or, according to others, Saosis, though some call her Nemanoun,which answers to the Greek name Athenais.XVI. Isis nursed the child by giving it her finger to suck instead of the breast. She likewise put him each nightinto the fire in order to consume his mortal part, whilst, having transformed herself into a swallow, she circledround the pillar and bemoaned her sad fate. This she continued to do for some time, till the queen, who stoodwatching her, observing the child to be all of a flame, cried out, and thereby deprived him of some of thatimmortality which would otherwise have been conferred upon him. The goddess then made herself known,and asked that the pillar which supported the roof might be given to her. Having taken the pillar down, she cutit open easily, and having taken out what she wanted, she wrapped up the remainder of the trunk in fine linen,and having poured perfumed oil over it, she delivered it again into the hands of the king and queen. Now, thispiece of wood is to this day preserved in the temple, and worshipped by the people of Byblos. When this wasdone, Isis threw herself upon the chest, and made at the same time such loud and terrible cries of lamentationover it, that the younger of the king's sons who heard her was frightened out of his life. But the elder of themshe took with her, and set sail with the chest for Egypt. Now, it being morning the river Phaedrus sent forth akeen and chill air, and becoming angry she dried up its current.XVII. At the first place where she stopped, and when she believed that she was alone, she opened the chest,and laying her face upon that of her dead husband, she embraced him and wept bitterly. Then, seeing that thelittle boy had silently stolen up behind her, and had found out the reason of her grief, she turned upon himsuddenly, and, in her anger, gave him so fierce and terrible a look that he died of fright immediately. Otherssay that his death did not happen in this manner, but, as already hinted, that he fell into the sea. Afterwards hereceived the greatest honour on account of the goddess, for this Maneros, whom the Egyptians so frequentlycall upon at their banquets, is none other than he. This story is contradicted by those who tell us that the truename of this child was Palaestinus, or Pelusius, and that the city of this name was built by the goddess inmemory of him. And they further add that this Maneros is thus honoured by the Egyptians at their feastsbecause he was the first who invented music. Others again state that Maneros is not the name of any particularperson, but a were customary form of complimentary greeting which the Egyptians use towards each other attheir more solemn feasts and banquets, meaning no more by it than to wish “that what they were then aboutmight prove fortunate and happy to them.” This is the true import of the word. In like manner they say that thehuman skeleton which is carried about in a box on festal occasions, and shown to the guests, is not designed,as some imagine, to represent the particular misfortunes of Osiris, but rather to remind them of their mortality,and thereby to excite them freely to make use of and to enjoy the good things which are set before them,seeing that they must quickly become such as they there saw. This is the true reason for introducing theskeleton at their banquets. But to proceed with the narrative.XVIII. When Isis had come to her son Horus, who was being reared at Buto,[FN#305] she deposited the chestin a remote and unfrequented place. One night, however, when Typhon was hunting by the light of the moon,he came upon it by chance, and recognizing the body which was enclosed in it, he tore it into several pieces,fourteen[FN#306] in all, and scattered them in different places up and down the country. When Isis knewwhat had been done, she set out in search of the scattered portions of her husband's body; and in order to passLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"more easily through the lower, marshy parts of the country, she made use of a boat made of the papyrus plant.For this reason, they say, either fearing the anger of the goddess, or else venerating the papyrus, the crocodilenever injures anyone who travels in this sort of vessel.[FN#307] And this, they say, hath given rise to thereport that there are very many different sepulchres of Osiris in Egypt, for wherever Isis found one of thescattered portions of her husband's body, there she buried it. Others, however, contradict this story, and tell usthat the variety of sepulchres of Osiris was due rather to the policy of the queen, who, instead of the real body,as she pretended, presented to these cities only an image of her husband. This she did in order to increase thehonours which would by these means be paid to his memory, and also to defeat Typhon, who, if he werevictorious in his fight against Horus in which he was about to engage, would search for the body of Osiris, andbeing distracted by the number of sepulchres would despair of ever being able to find the true one. We aretold, moreover, that notwithstanding all her efforts, Isis was never able to discover the phallus of Osiris,which, having been thrown into the Nile immediately upon its separation from the rest of the body,[FN#308]had been devoured by the Lepidotus, the Phagrus, and the Oxyrhynchus, fish which above all others, for thisreason, the Egyptians have in more especial avoidance. In order, however, to make some amends for the loss,Isis consecrated the phallus made in imitation of it, and instituted a solemn festival to its memory, which iseven to this day observed by the Egyptians.[FN#305] In Egyptian, the double city Pe−Tep. See the texts from the Metternich Stele printed in this volume.[FN#306] The fourteen members are: head, feet, bones, arms, heart, interior, tongue, eyes, fists, fingers, back,ears, loins, and body. Some of the lists in Egyptian add the face of a ram and the hair. The cities in which Isisburied the portions of his body are: Koptos, Philae in Elephantine, Herakleopolis Magna, Kusae, Heliopolis,Diospolis of Lower Egypt, Letopolis, Sais, Hermopolis of Lower Egypt, Athribis, Aq (Schedia), Ab in theLibyan nome, Netert, Apis.[FN#307] Moses was laid in an ark of bulrushes, i.e., papyrus, and was found uninjured.[FN#308] We meet with a similar statement in the Tale of the Two Brothers, where we are told that theyounger brother, having declared his innocence to the elder brother, out off his phallus and threw it into theriver, where it was devoured by the naru fish.XIX. After these things Osiris returned from the other world, and appeared to his son Horus, and encouragedhim to fight, and at the same time instructed him in the exercise of arms. He then asked him what he thoughtwas the most glorious action a man could perform, to which Horus replied, “To revenge the injuries offered tohis father[FN#309] and mother.” Osiris then asked him what animal he thought most serviceable to a soldier,and Horus replied, “A horse.” On this Osiris wondered, and he questioned him further, asking him why hepreferred a horse to a lion, and Horus replied, “Though the lion is the more serviceable creature to one whostands in need of help, yet is the horse more useful in overtaking and cutting off a flying enemy.”[FN#310]These replies caused Osiris to rejoice greatly, for they showed him that his son was sufficiently prepared forhis enemy. We are, moreover, told that amongst the great numbers who were continually deserting fromTyphon's party was his concubine Thoueris,[FN#311] and that a serpent which pursued her as she was comingover to Horus was slain by his soldiers. The memory of this action is, they say, still preserved in that cordwhich is thrown into the midst of their assemblies, and then chopped in pieces. Afterwards a battle took placebetween Horus and Typhon, which lasted many days, but Horus was at length victorious, and Typhon wastaken prisoner. He was delivered over into the custody of Isis, who, instead of putting him to death, loosed hisfetters and set him free. This action of his mother incensed Horus to such a degree that he seized her, andpulled the royal crown off her head; but Hermes came forward, and set upon her head the head of an oxinstead of a helmet.[FN#312] After this Typhon accused Horus of illegitimacy, but, by the assistance ofHermes, his legitimacy was fully established by a decree of the gods themselves.[FN#313] After this twoother battles were fought between Horus and Typhon, and in both Typhon was defeated. Moreover, Isis is saidto have had union with Osiris after his death,[FN#314] and she brought forth Harpokrates,[FN#315] whoLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"came into the world before his time, and was lame in his lower limbs.[FN#309] The texts give as a very common title of Horus, “Horus, the avenger of his father.”[FN#310] There is no evidence that the Egyptians employed the horse in war before the XVIIIth Dynasty, afact which proves that the dialogue here given is an invention of a much later date than the original legend ofOsiris.[FN#311] In Egyptian, TA−URT, the hippopotamus goddess.[FN#312] According to the legend given in the Fourth Sallier Papyrus, the fight between Horus and Set beganon the 26th day of the month of Thoth, and lasted three days and three nights. It was fought in or near the hallof the lords of Kher−aha, i.e., near Heliopolis, and in the presence of Isis, who seems to have tried to spareboth her brother Set and her son Horus. For some reason Horus became enraged with his mother, andattacking her like a “leopard of the south,” he cut off the head of Isis. Thereupon Thoth came forward, andusing words of power, created a substitute in the form of a cow's head, and placed it on her body (Sallier, iv.,p. 2; see Select Papyri, pl. cxlv.).[FN#313] Horus inherited the throne by his father's will, a fact which is so often emphasized in the texts that itseems there may be some ground for Plutarch's view.[FN#314] This view is confirmed by the words in the hymn to Osiris, “she moved the inactivity of theStill−Heart (Osiris), she drew from him his essence, she made an heir.”[FN#315] In Egyptian, HERU−PA−KHART, “Horus the Child.”XX. Such then are the principal circumstances of this famous story, the more harsh and shocking parts of it,such as the cutting up of Horus and the beheading of Isis, being omitted. Now, if such could be supposed to bethe real sentiments of the Egyptians concerning those divine Beings whose most distinguishing characteristicsare happiness and immortality, or could it be imagined that they actually believed what they thus tell us everto have actually taken place, I should not need to warn you, O Clea, you who are already sufficiently averse tosuch impious and absurd notions of the God, I should not, I say, have need to caution you, to testify yourabhorrence of them, and, as Aeschylus expresses it, “to spit and wash your mouth” after the recital of them. Inthe present case, however, it is not so. And I doubt not that you yourself are conscious of the differencebetween this history and those light and idle fictions which the poets and other writers of fables, like spiders,weave and spin out of their own imaginations, without having any substantial ground or firm foundation towork upon. There must have been some real distress, some actual calamity, at the bottom as the ground−workof the narration; for, as mathematicians assure us, the rainbow is nothing else but a variegated image of thesun, thrown upon the sight by the reflection of his beams from the clouds; and thus ought we to look upon thepresent story as the representation, or rather reflection, of something real as its true cause. And this notion isstill farther suggested to us as well by that solemn air of grief and sadness which appears in their sacrifices, asby the very form and arrangement of their temples, which extend into long avenues and open aisles in someportions,[FN#316] and in others retreating into dark and gloomy chapels which resembled the undergroundvaults which are allotted to the dead. That the history has a substantial foundation is proved by the opinionwhich obtains generally concerning the sepulchres of Osiris. There are many places wherein his body is saidto have been deposited, and among these are Abydos and Memphis, both of which are said to contain hisbody. It is for this reason, they say, that the richer and more prosperous citizens wish to be buried in theformer of these cities, being ambitious of lying, as it were, in the grave with Osiris.[FN#317] The title ofMemphis to be regarded as the grave of Osiris seems to rest upon the fact that the Apis Bull, who isconsidered to be the image of the soul of Osiris, is kept in that city for the express purpose that it may be asnear his body as possible.[FN#318] Others again tell us that the interpretation of the name Memphis[FN#319]Legends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.75"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"is “the haven of good men,” and that the true sepulchre of Osiris lies in that little island which the Nile makesat Philae.[FN#320] This island is, they say, inaccessible, and neither bird can alight on it, nor fish swim nearit, except at the times when the priests go over to it from the mainland to solemnize their customary rites tothe dead, and to crown his tomb with flowers, which, they say, is overshadowed by the branches of atamarisk−tree, the size of which exceeds that of an olive−tree.[FN#316] Plutarch refers to the long colonnaded courts which extend in a straight line to the sanctuary, whichoften contains more than one shrine, and to the chambers wherein temple properties, vestments, &c., werekept.[FN#317] In what city the cult of Osiris originated is not known, but it is quite certain that before the end ofthe VIth Dynasty Abydos became the centre of his worship, and that he dispossessed the local god An−Her inthe affections of the people. Tradition affirmed that the head of Osiris was preserved at Abydos in a box, and apicture of it, #### became the symbol of the city. At Abydos a sort of miracle play, in which all the sufferingsand resurrection of Osiris were commemorated, was performed annually, and the raising up of a model of hisbody, and the placing of his head upon it, were the culminating ceremonies. At Abydos was the famous shaftinto which offerings were cast for transmission to the dead in the Other World, and through the Gap in thehills close by souls were believed to set out on their journey thither. One tradition places the Elysian Fields inthe neighbourhood of Abydos. A fine stone bier, a restoration probably of the XXVIth Dynasty, whichrepresented the original bier of Osiris, was discovered there by M. Amelineau. It is now in the EgyptianMuseum at Cairo.[FN#318] Apis is called the “life of Osiris,” ####, and on the death of the Bull, its soul went to heaven andjoined itself to that of Osiris, and it formed with him the dual−god Asar−Hep, i.e., Osiris−Apis, or Sarapis.The famous Serapeum at Memphis was called ####.[FN#319] In Egyptian, Men−Nefer, i.e., “fair haven.”[FN#320] Osiris and Isis were worshipped at Philae until the reign of Justinian, when his general, Narses,closed the temple and carried off the statues of the gods to Constantinople, where they were probably melteddown.XXI. Eudoxus indeed asserts that, although there are many pretended sepulchres of Osiris in Egypt, the, placewhere his body actually lies is Busiris,[FN#321] where likewise he was born.[FN#322] As to Taphosiris, thereis no need to mention it particularly, for its very name indicates its claim to be the tomb of Osiris. There arelikewise other circumstances in the Egyptian ritual which hint to us the reality upon which this history isgrounded, such as their cleaving the trunk of a tree, their wrapping it up in linen which they tear in pieces forthat purpose, and the libations of oil which they afterwards pour upon it; but these I do not insist on, becausethey are intermixed with such of their mysteries as may not be revealed.[FN#321] In Egyptian, Pa−Asar−neb−Tetu, “the house of Osiris, the lord of Tetu.” In the temple ofNeb−Sekert, the backbone of the god was preserved, according to one text, but another says it was his jaws(?)and interior.[FN#322] This view represents a late tradition, or at all events one which sprang up after the decay of Abydos.[FIRST EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]XXII. Now as to those who, from many things of this kind, some of which are proclaimed openly, and othersare darkly hinted at in their religious institutions, would conclude that the whole story is no other than a merecommemoration of the various actions of their kings and other great men, who, by reason of their excellentLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.76"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"virtue and the mightiness of their power, added to their other titles the honour of divinity, though theyafterwards fell into many and grievous calamities, those, I say, who would in this manner account for thevarious scenes above−mentioned, must be owned indeed to make use of a very plausible method of eludingsuch difficulties as may arise about this subject, and ingeniously enough to transfer the most shocking parts ofit from the divine to the human nature. Moreover, it must be admitted that such a solution is not entirelydestitute of any appearance of historical evidence for its support. For when the Egyptians themselves tell usthat Hermes had one hand shorter than another, that Typhon was of red complexion, Horus fair, and Osirisblack, does not this show that they were of the human species, and subject to the same accidents as all othermen?[FN#323] Nay, they go farther, and even declare the particular work in which each was engaged whilstalive. Thus they say that Osiris was a general, that Canopus, from whom the star took its name, was a pilot,and that the ship which the Greeks call Argo, being made in imitation of the ship of Osiris, was, in honour ofhim, turned into a constellation and placed near Orion and the Dog−star, the former being sacred to Horus andthe latter to Isis.[FN#323] Red is the colour attributed to all fiends in the Egyptian texts. One of the forms of Horus isdescribed as being “blue−eyed,” and the colour of the face of Osiris is often green, and sometimes black.XXIII. But I am much afraid that to give in to this explanation of the story will be to move things which oughtnot to be moved; and not only, as Simonides says, “to declare war against all antiquity,” but likewise againstwhole families and nations who are fully possessed with the belief in the divinity of these beings. And itwould be no less than dispossessing those great names of their heaven, and bringing them down to the earth. Itwould be to shake and loosen a worship and faith which have been firmly settled in nearly all mankind fromtheir infancy. It would be to open a wide door for atheism to enter in at, and to encourage the attempts of thosewho would humanize the divine nature. More particularly it would give a clear sanction and authority to theimpostures of Euhemerus the Messenian, who from mere imagination, and without the least appearance oftruth to support it, has invented a new mythology of his own, asserting that “all those in general who arecalled and declared to be gods are none other than so many ancient generals and sea−captains and kings.”Now, he says that he found this statement written in the Panchaean dialect in letters of gold, though in whatpart of the globe his Panchaeans dwell, any more than the Tryphillians, whom he mentions at the same timewith them, he does not inform us. Nor can I learn that any other person, whether Greek or Barbarian, excepthimself, has ever yet been so fortunate as to meet with these imaginary countries.[In Sec. XXIV. Plutarch goes on to say that the Assyrians commemorate Semiramis, the Egyptians Sesostris,the Phrygians Manis or Masdis, the Persians Cyrus, and the Macedonians Alexander, yet these heroes are notregarded as gods by their peoples. The kings who have accepted the title of gods have afterwards had to sufferthe reproach of vanity and presumption, and impiety and injustice.][SECOND EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]XXV. There is another and a better method which some employ in explaining this story. They assert that whatis related of Typhon, Osiris, and Isis is not to be regarded as the afflictions of gods, or of mere mortals, butrather as the adventures of certain great Daemons. These beings, they say, are supposed by some of the wisestof the Greek philosophers, that is to say, Plato, Pythagoras, Xenocrates, and Chrysippus, in accordance withwhat they had learned from ancient theologians, to be stronger and more powerful than men, and of a naturesuperior to them. They are, at the same time, inferior to the pure and unmixed nature of the gods, as partakingof the sensations of the body, as well as of the perceptions of the soul, and consequently liable to pain as wellas pleasure, and to such other appetites and affections, as flow from their various combinations. Suchaffections, however, have a greater power and influence over some of them than over others, just as there aredifferent degrees of virtue and vice found in these Daemons as well as in mankind. In like manner, the wars ofthe Giants and the Titans which are so much spoken of by the Greeks, the detestable actions of Kronos, thecombats between Apollo and the Python, the flights of Dionysos, and the wanderings of Demeter, are exactlyLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"of the same nature as the adventures of Osiris and Typhon. Therefore, they all are to be accounted for in thesame manner, and every treatise of mythology will readily furnish us with an abundance of other similarinstances. The same thing may also be affirmed of those other things which are so carefully concealed underthe cover of mysteries and imitations.[In Sec. XXVI. Plutarch points out that Homer calls great and good men “god−like” and “God's compeers,”but the word Daemon is applied to the good and bad indifferently (see Odyssey, vi. 12; Iliad, xiii. 810, v. 438,iv. 31, &c.). Plato assigns to the Olympian Gods good things and the odd numbers, and the opposite to theDaemons. Xenocrates believed in the existence of a series of strong and powerful beings which take pleasurein scourgings and fastings, &c. Hesiod speaks of “holy daemons” (Works and Days, 126) and “guardians ofmankind,” and “bestowers of wealth,” and these are regarded by Plato as a “middle order of beings betweenthe gods and men, interpreters of the wills of the gods to men, and ministering to their wants, carrying theprayers and supplications of mortals to heaven, and bringing down thence in return oracles and all otherblessings of life.” Empedocles thought that the Daemons underwent punishment, and that when chastened andpurified they were restored to their original state.][Sec. XXVII. To this class belonged Typhon, who was punished by Isis. In memory of all she had done andsuffered, she established certain rites and mysteries which were to be types and images of her deeds, andintended these to incite people to piety, and, to afford them consolation. Isis and Osiris were translated fromgood Daemons into gods, and the honours due to them are rightly of a mixed kind, being those due to godsand Daemons. Osiris is none other than Pluto, and Isis is not different from Proserpine.][Sec. XXX. Typhon is held by the Egyptians in the greatest contempt, and they do all they can to vilify him.The colour red being associated with him, they treat with contumely all those who have a ruddy complexion;the ass[FN#324] being usually of a reddish colour, the men of Koptos are in the habit of sacrificing asses bycasting them down precipices. The inhabitants of Busiris and Lycopolis never use trumpets, because theirsounds resemble the braying of an ass. The cakes which are offered at the festivals during Paoni and Paopi arestamped with the figure of a fettered ass. The Pythagoreans regarded Typhon as a daemon, and according tothem he was produced in the even number fifty−six; and Eudoxus says that a figure of fifty−six angles typifiesthe nature of Typhon.][FN#324] The ass is associated with Set, or Typhon, in the texts, but on account of his virility he also typifiesa form of the Sun−god. In a hymn the deceased prays, “May I smite the Ass, may I crush the serpent−fiendSebau,” but the XLth Chapter of the Book of the Dead is entitled, “Chapter of driving back the Eater of theAss.” The vignette shows us the deceased in the act of spearing a monster serpent which has fastened its jawsin the back of an ass. In Chapter CXXV. there is a dialogue between the Cat and the Ass.[Sec. XXXI. The Egyptians only sacrifice red−coloured bulls, and a single black or white hair in the animal'shead disqualifies it for sacrifice. They sacrifice creatures wherein the souls of the wicked have been confined,and through this view arose the custom of cursing the animal to be sacrificed, and cutting off its bead andthrowing it into the Nile. No bullock is sacrificed which has not on it the seal of the priests who were called“Sealers.” The impression from this seal represents a man upon his knees, with his hands tied behind him, anda sword pointed at his throat. The ass is identified with Typhon not only because of his colour, but alsobecause of his stupidity and the sensuality of his disposition. The Persian king Ochus was nicknamed the“Ass,” which made him to say, “This ass shall dine upon your ox,” and accordingly he slew Apis. Typhon issaid to have escaped from Horus by a flight of seven days on an ass.][THIRD EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]XXXII. Such then are the arguments of those who endeavour to account for the above−mentioned history ofIsis and Osiris upon a supposition that they were of the order of Daemons; but there are others who pretend toLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"explain it upon other principles, and in more philosophical manner. To begin, then, with those whosereasoning is the most simple and obvious. As the Greeks allegorize their Kronos into Time, and their Herainto Air, and tell us that the birth of Hephaistos is no other but the change of air into fire, so thesephilosophers say that by Osiris the Egyptians mean the Nile, by Isis that part of the country which Osiris, orthe Nile, overflows, and by Typhon the sea, which, by receiving the Nile as it runs into it, does, as it were, tearit into many pieces, and indeed entirely destroys it, excepting only so much of it as is admitted into the bosomof the earth in its passage over it, which is thereby rendered fertile. The truth of this explanation is confirmed,they say, by that sacred dirge which they make over Osiris when they bewail “him who was born on the rightside of the world and who perished on the left.”[FN#325] For it must be observed that the Egyptians lookupon the east as the front or face of the world,[FN#326] upon the north as its right side,[FN#327] and uponthe south as its left.[FN#328] As, therefore, the Nile rises in the south, and running directly northwards is atlast swallowed up by the sea, it may rightly enough be said to be born on the right and to perish on the leftside. This conclusion, they say, is still farther strengthened from that abhorrence which the priests expresstowards the sea, as well as salt, which they call “Typhon's foam.” And amongst their prohibitions is one whichforbids salt being laid on their tables. And do they not also carefully avoid speaking to pilots, because thisclass of men have much to do with the sea and get their living by it? And this is not the least of their reasonsfor the great dislike which they have for fish, and they even make the fish a symbol of “hatred,” as is provedby the pictures which are to be seen on the porch of the temple of Neith at Sais. The first of these is a child,the second is an old man, the third is a hawk, and then follow a fish and a hippopotamus. The meaning of allthese is evidently, “O you who are coming into the world, and you who are going out of it (i.e., both youngand old), God hateth impudence.” For by the child is indicated “all those who are coming into life”; by the oldman, “those who are going out of it”; by the hawk, “God”; by the fish, “hatred,” on account of the sea, as hasbeen before stated; and by the hippopotamus, “impudence,” this creature being said first to slay his sire, andafterwards to force his dam.[FN#329] The Pythagoreans likewise may be thought perhaps by some to havelooked upon the sea as impure, and quite different from all the rest of nature, and that thus much is intendedby them when they call it the “tears of Kronos.”[FN#325] Plutarch here refers to Osiris as the Moon, which rises in the West.[FN#326] According to the texts the front of the world was the south, khent, #### and from this word isformed the verb #### #### “to sail to the south.”[FN#327] In the texts the west is the right side, unemi, #### in Coptic, ####.[FN#328] In the texts the east is the left side, abti.[FN#329] Each of these signs, ####, except the last, does mean what Plutarch says it means, but his method ofreading them together is wrong, and it proves that he did not understand that hieroglyphics were usedalphabetically as well as ideographically.[Secs. XXXIII., XXXIV. Some of the more philosophical priests assert that Osiris does not symbolize the Nileonly, nor Typhon the sea only, but that Osiris represents the principle and power of moisture in general, andthat Typhon represents everything which is scorching, burning, and fiery, and whatever destroys moisture.Osiris they believe to have been of a black[FN#330] colour, because water gives a black tinge to everythingwith which it is mixed. The Mnevis Bull[FN#331] kept at Heliopolis is, like Osiris, black in colour, “and evenEgypt[FN#332] itself, by reason of the extreme blackness of the soil, is called by them 'Chemia,' the veryname which is given to the black part or pupil of the eye.[FN#333] It is, moreover, represented by them underthe figure of a human heart.” The Sun and Moon are not represented as being drawn about in chariots, but assailing round the world in ships, which shows that they owe their motion, support, and nourishment to thepower of humidity.[FN#334] Homer and Thales both learned from Egypt that “water was the first principle ofall things, and the cause of generation.”[FN#335]]Legends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.79"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"[FN#330] Experiments recently conducted by Lord Rayleigh indicate that the true colour of water is blue.[FN#331] In Egyptian, Nem−ur, or Men−ur, and he was “called the life of Ra.”[FN#332] The commonest name of Egypt is Kemt, “black land,” as opposed to the reddish−yellow sandydeserts on each side of the “valley of black mud.” The word for “black” is kam.[FN#333] Plutarch seems to have erred here. The early texts call the pupil of the eye “the child in the eye,” asdid the Semitic peoples (see my Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, p. 136). The Copts spoke of the “black of theeye,” derived from the hieroglyphic “darkness,” “blackness.”[FN#334] There is no support for this view in the texts.[FN#335] It was a very common belief in Egypt that all things arose from the great celestial ocean called Nu,whence came the Nile.[Sec. XXXVI. The Nile and all kinds of moisture are called the “efflux of Osiris.” Therefore awater−pitcher[FN#336] is always carried first in his processions, and the leaf of a fir−tree represents bothOsiris and Egypt.[FN#337] Osiris is the great principle of fecundity, which is proved by the Pamylia festivals,in which a statue of the god with a triple phallus is carried about.[FN#338] The three−fold phallus merelysignifies any great and indefinite number.][FN#336] Plutarch refers to the vessel of water, with which the priest sprinkles the ground to purify it.[FN#337] He seems to refer here to the olive−tree: Beqet, “olive land,” was one of the names of Egypt.[FN#338] Plutarch seems to be confounding Osiris with Menu, the god of generation, who is generallyrepresented in an ithyphallic form. The festival of the phallus survived in Egypt until quite recently.[Sec. XXXVIII. The Sun is consecrated to Osiris, and the lion is worshipped, and temples are ornamentedwith figures of this animal, because the Nile rises when the sun is in the constellation of the Lion. Horus, theoffspring of Osiris, the Nile, and Isis, the Earth, was born in the marshes of Buto, because the vapour of dampland destroys drought. Nephthys, or Teleute, represents the extreme limits of the country and the sea−shore,that is, barren land. Osiris (i.e., the Nile) overflowed this barren land, and Anubis[FN#339] was theresult.[FN#340]][FN#339] The Egyptian Anpu. The texts make one form of him to be the son of Set and Nephthys.[FN#340] Plutarch's explanations in this chapter are unsupported by the texts.[Sec. XXXIX. In the first part of this chapter Plutarch continues his identification of Typhon with drought,and his ally Aso, Queen of Ethiopia, he considers to be the Etesian or north winds, which blow for a longperiod when the Nile is falling. He goes on to say:—]As to what they relate of the shutting up of Osiris in a box, this appears to mean the withdrawal of the Nile toits own bed. This is the more probable as this misfortune is said to have happened to Osiris in the month ofHathor, precisely at that season of the year when, upon the cessation of the Etesian or north winds the Nilereturns to its own bed, and leaves the country everywhere bare and naked. At this time also the length of thenights increases, darkness prevails, whilst light is diminished and overcome. At this time the priests celebratedoleful rites, and they exhibit as a suitable representation of the grief of Isis a gilded ox covered with a fineblack linen cloth. Now, the ox is regarded as the living image of Osiris. This ceremony is performed on theLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"seventeenth and three following days,[FN#341] and they mourn: 1. The falling of the Nile; 2. The cessation ofthe north winds; 3. The decrease in the length of the days; 4. The desolate condition of the land. On thenineteenth of the month Pachons they march in procession to the sea, whither the priests and other officialscarry the sacred chest, wherein is enclosed a small boat of gold; into this they first pour some water, and thenall present cry out with a loud voice, “Osiris is found.” This done, they throw some earth, scent, and spicesinto the water, and mix it well together, and work it up into the image of a crescent, which they afterwardsdress in clothes. This shows that they regard the gods as the essence and power of water and earth.[FN#341] The 17th day is very unlucky; the 18th is very lucky; the 19th and 20th are very unlucky. On the17th day Isis and Nephthys made great lamentation for their brother Un−nefer at Sais; on the 19th no manshould leave the house; and the man born on the 20th would die of the plague.[Sec. XL. Though Typhon was conquered by Horus, Isis would not allow him to be destroyed. Typhon wasonce master of all Egypt, i.e., Egypt was once covered by the sea, which is proved by the sea−shells which aredug out of the mines, and are found on the tops of the hills. The Nile year by year creates new land, and thusdrives away the sea further and further, i.e., Osiris triumphs over Typhon.][FOURTH EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.][Sec. XLI. Osiris is the Moon, and Typhon is the Sun; Typhon is therefore called Seth,[FN#342] a wordmeaning “violence,” “force,” &c. Herakles accompanies the Sun, and Hermes the Moon. In Sec. XLII.Plutarch connects the death−day of Osiris, the seventeenth of Hathor, with the seventeenth day of the Moon'srevolution, when she begins to wane. The age of Osiris, twenty−eight years, suggests the comparison with thetwenty−eight days of the Moon's revolution. The tree−trunk which is made into the shape of a crescent at thefuneral of Osiris refers to the crescent moon when she wanes. The fourteen pieces into which Osiris wasbroken refer to the fourteen days in which the moon wanes.][FN#342] In Egyptian, ####, or #### which Plutarch seems to connect with set, ####.[Sec. XLIII. The height of the Nile in flood at Elephantine is twenty− eight cubits, at Mendes and Xois lowNile is seven cubits, and at Memphis middle Nile is fourteen cubits; these figures are to be compared with thetwenty−eight days of the Moon's revolution, the seven−day phase of the Moon, and the fourteen days' Moon,or full moon. Apis was begotten by a ray of light from the Moon, and on the fourteenth day of the monthPhamenoth[FN#343] Osiris entered the Moon. Osiris is the power of the Moon, Isis the productive faculty init.][FN#343] Marked in the papyrus Sallier IV. as a particularly unlucky day.[FIFTH EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.][Sec. XLIV. The philosophers say that the story is nothing but an enigmatical description of the phenomena ofEclipses. In Sec. XLV. Plutarch discusses the five explanations which he has described, and begins to state hisown views about them. It must be concluded, he says, that none of these explanations taken by itself containsthe true explanation of the foregoing history, though all of them together do. Typhon means every phase ofNature which is hurtful and destructive, not only drought, darkness, the sea, &c. It is impossible that any onecause, be it bad or even good, should be the common principle of all things. There must be two opposite andquite different and distinct Principles. In Sec. XLVI., Plutarch compares this view with the Magian belief inOrmazd and Ahriman, the former springing from light (Sec. XLVII.), and the latter from darkness. Ormazdmade six good gods, and Ahriman six of a quite contrary nature. Ormazd increased his own bulk three times,and adorned the heaven with stars, making the Sun to be the guard of the other stars. He then createdtwenty−four other gods, and placed them in an egg, and Ahriman also created twenty−four gods; the latterLegends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.81"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"bored a hole in the shell of the egg and effected an entrance into it, and thus good and evil became mixedtogether. In Sec. XLVIII. Plutarch quotes Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Aristotle, and Plato in support of hishypothesis of the Two Principles, and refers to Plato's Third Principle. Sec. XLIX. Osiris represents the goodqualities of the universal Soul, and Typhon the bad; Bebo[FN#344] is a malignant being like Typhon, withwhom Manetho identifies him. Sec. L. The ass, crocodile, and hippopotamus are all associated with Typhon;in the form of a crocodile Typhon escaped from Horus.[FN#345][FN#344] In Egyptian, Bebi, or Baba, or Babai, he was the first−born Son of Osiris.[FN#345] See the Legend of Heru−Behutet, {pr. 67}.The cakes offered on the seventh day of the month Tybi have a hippopotamus stamped on them. Sec. LI.Osiris symbolizes wisdom and power, and Typhon all that is malignant and bad.]The remaining sections contain a long series of fanciful statements by Plutarch concerning the religion andmanners and customs of the Egyptians, of which the Egyptian texts now available give no proofs.Legends Of The GodsCHAPTER IV.82"}]
