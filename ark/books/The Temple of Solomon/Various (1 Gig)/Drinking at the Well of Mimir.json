There are plentyof researchers out there far more knowledgeable than I, and I have no problem withthat. I don’t consider these books revolutionary in any way either; I seriously doubtwhether they will change the practice of Ásatrú in the modern world. What theyare is an Ásatrú man’s view of the world after having been Ásatrú two years shortof a full third of a century. They aremy views.When I was in 6th grade just entering junior high school in Lambertville, Michi-gan, I had few thoughts about religion. Our town was a collection of German-AmericanLutherns (who, like my grandfather, rarely, if ever, attended church) and Polish-AmericanCatholics who only went to church until they were old enough to start helping onthe farm. My mom was the oddball French-Canadian-Ojibwa Catholic who forcedme to go to Mt. Carmel Catholic church until I was 14 years old and who doesnot know to this day that Ischwäntst(played “hookey”) catechism from age 8 on.I asked my Grampa Jack one morning when we were hoeing corn what religion hewas. After a minute of leaning on his hoe and thinking he said, “I guess I belong tothe Linzie religion” and that was good enough for my 6th grade mind. Back then,I really didn’t think much about anything except for Laura Berry (who still comesto mind off and on) and Melanie Sigler.I wasschwäntsingMr. Thompson’s study hall one fine day and wound up in theschool library which really wasn’t much except that Laura or Melanie might showup once in a while. I don’t know why I was looking at the books on the shelves (ararity for me at the time), but I ran across an old book:Norse mythology,legends of giants and elves, trolls, wizards.The tales, poetry and the like were all familiar to me familiar to me. I had heardmany of the stories, and nasty giants, ogres, and elves were all a part of growing upin that time and place which almost seems like a foreign country now.Growing up in a German-Polish-American farming community which had barelycrept into the 20thcentury in the early 1960’s, one was barely out of rural Germanyand the stories were common. Most kids (except for the ones just moving from the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PrefacevFigure 1. Frontispiece of the old book(a)city or just visiting on summer vacation) and about half the adults of my parents’generation accepted the reality of elves. I remember the time when old PussigVanGunten and his wife climbed the tree in front of their place, and told the roadcrew that if they were going to chop down the tree, they would have to chop it downwith the two 80 year olds in it. Pussig was smart enough not to tell the road crewjustwhythe tree couldn’t be chopped down, but most of usknewwhoreallylivedin that tree. So, when I pulled the smelly old book down, it felt familiar.I creaked open the cover and read the quote by some guy named Thomas Carlyle.“I think Scandinavian Paganism, to us here, is more interesting than anyother. It is, for one thing, the latest; it continued in those regions of Europetill the eleventh century: eight hundred years ago the Norwegians were stillworshippers of Odin. It is interesting also as the creed of our fathers; themen whose blood still runs in our veins, whom doubtless we still resemble inmany ways. Strange: they did believe that, while we believe so differently. Wehave tolerable means to do it; for there is another point of interest in thesemythologies: that they have been preserved so well.“Neither is there no use in knowing something about this old Paganismof our fathers. Unconsciously, and combined with higher things, it is us yet,that old faith withal. To know it consciously brings us into closer and clearer"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Prefacevirelations with the past,-with our own possessions in the past. For the wholepast, as I keep repeating, is the possession of the present. The past had alwayssomething true, and is a precious possession. In a different time, in differentplace, it is always some other side of our common human nature that hasbeen developing itself.”–Thomas CarlyleI loved that book and read it cover to cover at least four times a year for the next3 years. My Grampa Jack was “Linzie religion” and so was I, but I belonged to theÁsa-Faith as well.I later bought a second printing of the book and still enjoy it. After 30 years ofÁsatrú the book has begun to even take on the smell of that original I once held inmy hands.I love the fact that I am a 3rdgeneration German-American. I now live in thesouthwest in a predominantly hispanic community and enjoyenchiladas y tamalesas much as I doSauerkraut mit Schinken und Äpfeln,but I never mistake where Icame from. I read a lot more now than I used to and move a little slower than whenI was still chasing Laura (and I do meanchasing—she was fast). I have a family ofmy own and I am 30+ years and 2000 miles away from the place of my upbringing,but I feel more a German-American now than I did growing up. I wrote this bookas an expression of thanks, I suppose.This book came together over a period of 10 years. I started in 1990 (the yearthat our town’s electricity went out on Superbowl Sunday), and I lost the firstthirty or so pages to an old, borrowed Apple IIe. Fortunately, I still had the originalhandwritten copy. Since that time, I’ve gone through 3 computers, Windows3.1,Windows95, Windows98, and now Linux/ FreeBSD; countless rewrites, and havelost half my hair, grown long in the tooth, became a Grampa, and got remarriedonly to have two more sons (one of whom is “Jack” born 99 years and 9 days afterhis namesake and founder of the ‘Linzie-religion’). A lot has happened in those 10years.The book actually started out as a 5-page essay but quickly took on a life of itsown sprawling out well beyond a ream of paper. The topics wander mainly becauseI like it that way. It starts with the individual who slowly discovers his relationshipto the world. It starts at the center of the universe, i.e.me–(yes, I’m slightlynarcissistic),and then looks out, then up, then down, and then further out. It isnot an instruction manual, but rather a record of learning. I’ve put in beaucoupquotes and named the authors and their books as well. There are plenty of personalobservations in here (actually, the bulk of what’s here ispersonal observations–Ijust ‘scotch-taped’ the personal observations together with quotes).I’m well aware that authors like to argue.

The older I get, the less I like toargue and the more I like to play fiddle and play with my sons (and my wife, whenshe lets mecatchher). If you want to get hold of me to tell about a great fiddletune you heard, you’ll have my undivided attention; on the other hand if you wantto tell about a mistake I made in my logic–forget it, I’m not biting.I put this book out for free. I did that for a reason. If you find that some of myideas are good, fine, they are there for the taking. Information is really no differentfrom fiddle tunes in my mind. They are both there to be taken–enjoyed. I don’tfigure the book’s a top-seller anyway, so I prefer to give it away. The way of lifethat the Ása-Faith offers is an enjoyable thing, and this is my way of giving-back.One other thing: I believe that the Ása-Faith should be free and personal. Noone cantellanother how to experience life, and certainly, no one shouldpayto learnabout how to experience life. I am not against people coming together for Ása-Faithholidays, but I still don’t like organized religion any more than Grampa Jack did. IwroteThe Ásatrú Folk Manifesto1in honor of him. He was my greatest inspiration,was a family man, and farmer, an upstanding member of our little community, aregular at the Grange, and the best of Grampas.1See Appendix forThe Ásatrú Folk Manifesto.It is self explanatory."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Chapter 1World ViewsRecently, I made a trip to the State of Washington to visit some friends.I had never been there before so they opted to take me out and show me thesights particularly the mountain plant life since I am an avid herbalist in myadopted home of New Mexico where I have lived most of my life. Some ofthe sights I had seen piqued my interest, others simply bothered me such asthe late rising of the sun and overcast skies, but on the last day of my stay Itruly saw a miraculous event in the sky: a huge, inverted thunderhead. Thiswas no ordinary thunderhead. I am well acquainted with impressive NewMexican thunderclouds, some of the most impressive in the world, but thisthunderhead was the Grandmother Thunderhead of All, and the fact that itwas built upside down was, by far, the most remarkable event in the skies thatI had seen since Halley’s comet!After a few minutes of the awe-inspiring sight (the imagination roams atthe speed of light in the presence of such majesty), Nancy, the driver, said,“Boy, Mt. Ranier looks great in this light!” Visions of massive rains, andlightening snapped out to be replaced by a magnificent mountain.

World Views2of that mountain “looks” like a thundercloud because she revealed Herself tome.On my return to New Mexico, I mentioned the sight of the inverted thun-derhead to a friend of mine. She said that she had seen it the first time shewent to Washington as well. Apparently, that mountain spirit reveals herselfto New Mexicans—we have an affinity with mountain spirits, you know.This chapter is about a different way of conceptualizing the world, about seeing it ina different light from some very different angles. It is about understanding the worldas would an anthropologist. It is odd but very true that the thing which absolutelyfascinates anthropologists about folks from other cultures is also that which irritatesand angers others who hold rigidly fixed belief systems such as separatists fromcertain Muslim sects now living world wide and dwellers in the breadbasket orheartland of the United States, and it should also be mentioned in the same sentencethat white, Anglo-Americans and Europeans are not necessarily the only xenophobesin the world. To grasp importance of and sometimes even deadly seriousness ofworldviews and the deeply ingrained effect that stems from the rigidity some ofthese, one only need to think back as far as the recent events in Bosnia, opposingreligious groups within a single culture trying to annihilate each other. This bookis not about separatism, though. In fact, if anything, it, like the anthropologist,elevates and celebrates the vast differences between cultures.Each culture in the world has its own way of viewing how things are put together,how things relate to one another in time and space, and what the meaning of eachevent is. Each interprets events through its own history, language, landscape, eco-nomic support system, religion, and its social structure. Each fits the individualinto a concept of the whole. This is the worldview of a culture. Over a periodof time, the tangled Shakespearean web of events within which each culture is en-meshed changes significantly enough that the culture itself is measurably changed,sometimes so much so that the members of the particular culture begin to separatethemselves out from their ancestral heritage. Sometimes a change like this comesslowly and easily while at other times being spurred on by plagues, drought or war,but a shift in worldview for any culture is inevitable. This book documents such ashift.The prehistory of Europe is nebulous and open to much speculation as to whatactually happened prior to the written historical record, and in spite of the fact thatmuch has been recorded since the time when Romans still occupied Britain, whenthe historical Jesus was still in the ancient equivalent of diapers, and when the greatGerman Nation was still but a handful of small clans separated from one another byvast stretches of primeval forest. So much has changed that the records themselvesdo not even seem accurate. A trip to the history section of any university library"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views3will inform the reader quite sufficiently as to just how much there is that we just donot know.This book is not really about history though. It is, however, about worldviews:oneworld view in particular. But before commencing any further, perhaps, thewordworldviewshould be defined so that everyone concerned is understanding theconcept in a similar fashion.worldview,n. sing. (plur. -s), a matrix or set of matrices that an individualhuman being or a defined group of human beings utilize for the purpose ofstoring, manipulating, and accessing information.1The problem with this definition, although precise, it is not self-explanatory.First, just exactly whatkindof “information” is meant here? The term “infor-mation” is not limited to any specific type (at least in this definition). Normally,with such a “scientific” sounding word, one immediately thinks of that informationwhich is learned from textbooks and experiments, but there is no need to be sotechnical. “Information,” in its most basic form, is of the most immediate kind:data collected from the body-data about what is going on inside the body, in theimmediate surroundings of the body, data collected through the sensory systems (vi-sual, tactile, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory). In other words, the “information”collected really relates to what one cansenseandknow.Primary information is gained from sensory experience, but information can alsobe gained secondarily by talking with someone, watching events on TV (or hearingthem on the radio), reading books about worldviews, etc. Even though the lattertype is extremely prevalent, experience generally holds the primary position. Forexample, all school-aged children learn that the sun does not move around the roundball of the earth, but that the earth rotates on its axis resulting in a visual illusionof the sun’s “movement.” The average individual’s sense of vision stores this visualinformation (primary) of the sun’srisingandsettingso much so that the Englishlanguage continues to use these terms as a standard way of marking time. We speakofsunriseand talk aboutwhen the sun goes down below the horizonand not aboutwhen the earth’s rotation brings the sun into view.Primary or sensory informationis deeply rooted into one’s culture regardless of whether the information is corrector not.In this same example, it is easy to see the less important status the secondary in-formation has. Indeed, although it also comes through the same sensory systems-through1Do not bother to look up this definition in any dictionary because I made it up. It may ormay not be similar to that which is defined in Anthro 101 textbooks; I do not really know. Thisdefinition was constructed from many different sources. ”worldview” is simply the translation ofthe German wordWeltanschauungwhich according to the American Heritage Dictionary (1978)means ”a comprehensiveworldview, especially from a specified point of reference.”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views4reading, hearing lectures, seeing movies , etc.-it does not leave the same impact onthe human mind as the “direct” experience of watching a sunrise!Now, there is a problem with what has just been termed “direct experience,”however. The human being is a complex animal, and because of this complexitymany things are often chalked up as direct experience when, in fact, they are not.For example, a young man walks into the grocery, and looks directly in to the eyes ofa young woman of approximately the same age, who then smiles at him. The “directexperience” is that of a young womansmilingat a young man; the “interpretation” ofthe event, on the other hand, is that the young womanlikesthe man (which may ormay not be the case). The physical event or experience is then stored together withthe interpretation of the event. As could be easily guessed, this kind of informationstorage can lead to a whole variety of problems for the individual.Direct experience as the primary source of information becomes even more con-fusing and complex in the case of “hallucinations” or simply “imaginings.” A hallu-cination is direct experience without a correlate in physical reality, and also oftenwithout a correlate in consensus reality. However, because hallucinations do involvedirect experience, i.e. are “experienced” by the individual, they must be treated as apart of that individual’s (or group’s) reality. Even more confusing is that people dealwith hallucinations (at least by this definition) quite often. For example, memoriesfit this definition, and so do dreams, fantasies, ideas, visualizations, etc., but mosttwentieth century people disregard this type of information to be either illusory orhaving come from the mind’s memory banks and give greater credence to only thosethings which have a correlate in physical reality. At least, this is howsomepeoplerespond. Here is a ficticious example which could be found in almost any dailynewspaper:A man has killed his wife in what seems to becold blood.An investigationreveals that the manfeltthat his wife was having an affair with a mutualacquaintance. Further investigation reveals that the wife had to work late atleast two times per week, and the husband who has been known to be quitejealous, killed her in a fit of rage one evening after she returned from work.As it turns out, the man was quite mistaken. His wife fearful of the jealousoutbursts had been faithful to her husband all along.Fantasy, fueled by the powerful emotions of insecurity and jealousy, has createda veryreal-feelinghallucination, a direct experience, with no more relationship tophysical reality than the wife’s not being home, and sorealdid it feel that theindividual felt “forced” or “obliged” to react. Although seeming a pretty extremeexample, on the one hand, most folks will “misinterpret” at least one other person’sbehavior on a daily basis and then will react to their own misinterpretations asif they were a part of physical or consensus reality. The problems presented by"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views5fantasy, memories (as in “false memory syndrome”), or even ideas fueled by powerfulemotions are quite common in spite of the fact that the 20thcentury is supposedto be the age of logic, reason and enlightenment.So callednormalpeople come equipped neurologically with some ability to dis-tinguish between what takes place in physical/ consensus reality and what doesnot. This is a decision that is mediated by an area of the brain called the limbicsystem, and, interestingly enough, this is also the same area of the brain which isinstrumental in the production and the tempering of emotions. If this area of thebrain is damaged in certain ways, the person has a very difficult time differentiat-ing between direct experience, which is related to events occurring in the externalenvironment, and fantasy or hallucination, which is produced completely within thebrain itself. These same people tend to feel that characters in a book or on televisionare part of consensus, physical reality as well. Generally, these problems are relatedto the psychological disorders of schizophrenia, personality disorders, and mentalretardation and are beyond the scope of this book. In spite of the fact that thesefolks respond to many things which have no basis in physical reality, it must beunderstood that they are directly experiencing the events.Common sense will usually tell us that our interpretation of thereal worldis thedirect result of personal experience with it, but the above examples complicate sucha simplistic version of reality. The above examples indicate that there are manytwo-way interactions which occur with experience feeding into interpretation which,in turn, guides how one experiences. The above example of the man shooting hiswife was not just an example of a single misinterpretation, but rather the shootingwas the result of a very complex personal reality which was built slowly out of therepeated interactions between personal experience (the man’s wife being late twicea week) and his interpretation (she is having an affair). These repeated interactionswere built up, one on top of the other, like layers of plaster across the surface ofa wooden table. After enough layers are put down, the resulting plastered surfacebegins to differ greatly from the original wooden layer until it’swoodenessis nolonger recognizable. This is how a worldview, or a personal interpretation system,affects the interpretation of reality.The difficulties that normal people experience when reacting to their own misin-terpretations is fairly commonplace and show up in the home, in social settings, andat the workplace, and because it is so common, people or groups of people create setsof rules to help individual members of the defined group decide what isreal(worthresponding to) and what is not. These rules also define how bits of information mustrelate to one another. For example, in 20thcentury America, a dream is not treatedasrealbecause it does not correlate with physical, consensus reality, even though,depending on the sub-group that one belongs to, a dream might be interpreted"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views6as memories, as completely random neuronal firings, as the brain working out itsproblems by bringing itself back into balance, as thesoulvisiting other places, oras aspirit visiting the individual. There are rules, then, for how a dream is to beinterpreted and dealt with depending on the cultural surroundings. The abstractconcept ofdreamfits into a nice cubby-hole somewhat like a postbox at the postoffice. This post office-style arrangement of reality is called amatrix,and there arecultural rules governing how all pieces of information are to be handled, how theyare to be stored, how each piece relates to the others, etc.Those who suffer from mental disorders are often operating with a different setof rules than others around them. Because of this, they tend to behave or react insome very socially inappropriate ways. They work by a completely different set ofrules than those they were taught as children, and this idiosyncratic set of rules isoften in conflict with the general or consensus set of rules (the common worldview) ofpeople they work or interact with. In some cases, these folksappeartounderstandconsensus reality (that which members of a defined group agree upon), but havevery often added, for reasons only known to themselves, other supplementary ruleswhich can result in some very bizarre behavior patterns. In other cases, there arethose who seem completely incapable of functioning within the matrix as prescribedby theirgroup,and these are often institutionalized for their own protection.Interestingly enough, somewhere in this discussion,foreignersmust fit. Anthro-pologists are well acquainted with this phenomenon ofculture clash.A young student from the University of New Mexico finds his first assign-ment in Zaïre. The first 6 months of the assignment are spent by his being thelaughing stock and endless source of entertainment for the locals. They loveto tell him little harmless lies such asa spirit-lives-in-everyone’s-left-nostrilorthe death sentence is applied for burping at the dinner table, and forenjoyment, they often work very hard to set up a whole variety of situationssimply to watch his inappropriate reactions.On the other hand the tribal members think the student a fool for notknowingthat medicines must be applied with certain feathers to be truly ef-fective or that the eyeballs of sheep are delicacies to be served only to honoredguests.The difference between a foreigner and one with a mental disorder is that the normal,but naive, foreigner is able to quickly learn about and adapt to his new setting. Verysoon, out of a sense of self preservation, he learns which behaviors his adopted culturedeemscrazyand consciously drops them from his repertoire, and even though hemay always be considered aforeigner, his attempts and successes in trying to learnthe new culture gradually become acceptable to the locals to a degree which isdefined by that group."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views7Occasionally, there are problems associated with one worldview clashing withanother. The mildest of these is what is normally termedculture shockwhere oneperson begins to interact with a culture that is slightly different than his own, suchas moving from one area of the United States to another. Moving from Kansasor Michigan to a small town in Arizona will make clear to anyone that there aredistinct, albeit subtle, regional differences in accents (dialects), slang vocabulary,the types of jokes people tell, customs relating to gender differences, cooking/ eatinghabits, styles of dress, acceptable color coordination for homes, styles of furniture,leisure-time activities, etc. ad infinitum. The reason for the existence of culturaldifferences should be obvious and predictable, but how each individual will react tosuch differences is not. The individual can view the differences as curious pointsof interest, somethingto write home about, or might be quite incapable (withoutassistance) of understanding and accepting the differences between cultures to thepoint where cultural differences can become a source of disgust or even hatred,in some extreme cases, leading to pathological behaviors or hate crime: racial orcultural discrimination, assaults, cross-burnings, hate speech, even murder. Theease with which an individual can move from one worldview to another is partof that individual’s make-up and is highly correlated with socio-economic status,cultural background, behaviors learned as a child, and religion/ education.A worldview is not only made up of things/ concepts fit into a matrix or amental filing system but is also made up of how these things relate to one another.In some cases, relationships are obvious and require little thinking. In Michigan,kielbasa(a form of smoked sausage), Polish culture, and farming communities areclosely correlated; in New Mexicochiles, Hispano/ Native American culture, south-western cooking are all easily related. However, the blatant extermination of owlsby members of the northeastern New Mexican culture is not easily explainable nor,even after it is explained, is it easily accepted byforeigners,especially 20thcenturyAnglo-Americans from an urban background. The fact is that owl in this area ofthe country is associated with thefactthat witches (brujas) fly around the smallcommunities in the dark of the night spying on innocent Christians and castingmalevolent spells resulting in sickness, madness, and in some cases, death. For thepeople of the northeastern New Mexican culture, the evil reality of the owl is justas much arealityas viral infections are for the modern physician. For these people,the equation, owls =brujas, is true.It isrelationshipsbetween events and objects, in other wordsthe personal in-terpretation based on a cultural worldview,which create the most complicated dif-ferences between cultures. For the average American, an owl is a night-flying birdof prey which in many areas of the United States is on the endangered species list.Possession of live birds, feathers from dead birds, and causing the death of any"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views8of the various owl species found throughout the country is illegal (and immoral tosome degree), and for the most part, these birds are usually thought of as being animportant part of the ecology of its geographical area. This way of viewing owlsand their relationship to the earth is part of the “standard American” worldview.However, to many of southwestern heritage such a view is absurd! The owl is,in fact, evil! The “spotted owl controversy” of the early 1990’s, which started inthe Pacific Northwest, brought these two previuosly insignificant views into conflictand, in some cases, actually became the source of physical altercations between thetwo opposing factions. Though seemingly important to the members of each partyinvolved, to those taking a neutral stance, the fights appeared trivial, and the idea oftaking sides sounded ridiculous. Who is right depends entirely upon the worldviewfrom which one is judging. For lumberjacks and Hispanics dead owls are fine; forNative Americans all owls are to be avoided if possible; and for the ecologicallyminded, dead owls were a sin against nature and a blemish on humanity. For folksof different heritages, relationships such as these can be confusing.Differences in worldviews have been the cause of wars from time to time. Onegroup persecutes another because both are unable to create some kind of “commonground.” The most bloody wars in history have been fought over differing world-views, often in the name of religion (which is just another layer in one’s worldview),such as the Crusades, and some of the cruelest cold wars, such as the Inquisitionwhich had by some reports approximately 6 million so-called heretics put to death.2Indigenous cultures almost always end up being overrun based on the idea thatthey are “Heathen” regardless of whether such a statement is actually true. Saamí,Filipinos, Jews, Africans, Bushmen, and Native Americans of both northern andsouthern hemispheres have all been subjected to often more than one attempt atgenocide because the members of the incoming culture were incapable of adapting toor accepting the native worldview. Even in the year 1999, in countries such as Nor-way, Canada, and the United States which are supposed to be technologically andsociologically advanced and somewhat culturally sensitive, prison inmates, hospitalpatients, and persons dying in rest homes are denied access to spiritual practicesif such practices fall outside the accepted “normal” religious definitions. In thesesame countries, cults practicing neo-Nazism, racial purity, political exclusivity, and2This number has been rather hotly debated. Some members of the New Age movement(usually neo-pagans) like to claim the highest number which is over 6 million, but this authorhas seen reports which indicate that the number may have been much lower. Additionally, thepresentation is such that itsoundslike it happened all at one time like a tribal extermination, butthe fact is that the executions lasted over a period of 6 centuries and the deaths included men,women, children, and folks from all cultures known at the time. Reports of these deaths have alsomade it sound as though the folk exterminated were primarily women, but this is also not the case."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views9even “barrio” gangs continue to flourish and carry on the traditions of inflexibility,intolerance, and xenophobia.So far, particular worldviews have been discussed as if they belong to particularcultures, and, to some degree, that is true. There is another interesting feature ofworldviews, however: they canchangewithin the same culture over a period of time.They become altered due to various changes taking place in the social, economic,or physical environments. The worldview of the midwestern American farmer, forexample, has changed drastically over the past 50 years. Changes in technology,communications, weather conditions, education and educational standards, humanmovement patterns, economics, and general experience have all come together tobring about changes in how the once rural Iowan or Nebraskan now views/ interpretshis world. In fact, there have been so many changes over the years that one couldeasily create a field of study at the university level revolving only around ruralmid-western United States of the early to mid-20th century! So far we have pointedout that worldviews are subject to change depending on the conditions supportingthem, but they can also be changed intentionally, and this book documents one suchchange.What is it that encourages or pushes one into adopting a different worldviewespecially when it may differ from “consensus reality” (the prevailing ‘mental filingsystem’ of one’s own community) or may differ radically from the one that onewas raised with? The overall purpose of a worldview has already been defined asa way in which we humans store and retrieve information. In computer terms, ifinformationis the “data,” then aworldviewis the filtering software which rendersthe data usable by the rest of the system. Data are no good unless one is able toretrieve and manipulate them to some end. Additionally. a worldview is a way for anindividual to be able toplacehimself spatially within the universe and temporallyin terms of history and allows him to communicate with others within the samesystem. The data are then manipulated so that certain predictions can then bemade about the universe. Without a worldview, the entire universe is simply madeup of a chaos of facts, a place wherein one cannot survive. Even cats and lizardswith their experience-generated worldviews are able to make certain predictionsabout the world around them. Were they not able to do so, they would starve todeath. But why would one wish to adoptanotherworldview in addition to the onethey were raised within?There really may not be any good answer to this question. Some folks are bornseemingly satisfied with the way the world appears to work around them whileothers are bornseeking. The question really seems to have much to do with a senseof “wholeness” which is what this book is about. A precise definition of “wholeness”is nebulous, but relates to a feeling of well-being within the universe, a feeling of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views10belonging. Some folks seem to be born with this feeling (the number is very few,however), but most begin to develop a feeling that “Surely, this can’t be all there is!”From that point on, the search has begun. It is this unfilled need which drives andspurs on scientific research, goads philosophers, causes spouse to leave spouse, andchildren to leave home. It is the feeling that the grass is always greener somewhereelse, the human longing to return to Eden, Oz, or to the Land of the Ancestors.The search for “wholeness” is the reason why cults and gangs never seem to lackfor members, and why suicide often seems the only viable choice for the chronicallydepressed. This book is about this search.Stability is an important function of a worldview. Stability comes from knowingwhere one stands within the family, community, or world and from being able topredict with a fair degree of accuracy what one’s standing will be tomorrow. Stabilitysprings from being able to remember and compare the past to the present, andfrom being able to project that information into the future: “I was born as mymother’s son, I still am my mother’s son, and I will continue to be my mother’sson.” Such a simplistic statement should be easily understood by anybody withany sense at all! Not quite . . . . There are a whole variety of events, disorders, orchoices which can lead to a disintegration of even the simplest forms of stability.Individuals in any of these cases can be thrown into madness where the world nolonger holds any meaning and where chaos is the order of the day! Amnesia inducedby blows to the head or by drug overdoses is a complete loss of identity in manycases requiring institutionalization and extensive treatment. Alzheimer’s Diseasedecreases the ability to interact with the world efficiently. Severe psychologicaldisorders such as schizophrenia and diseases like chronic drug or alcohol addictioncan lead to a break with one’s personal worldview and certainly with consensusreality by either mutating existing worldviews or in some cases even generatinga new one. Psychological trauma such as Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome, NearDeath Experiences (NDE’s), or the death of a loved one can lead to the permanentdismantling or rearranging of one’s worldview. Although for an outsider lookingin, it appears that nothing has changed, i.e. “he is still his mother’s son,” but forthe afflicted individual, it isthe worldthat has gone mad. There is no longer anystability. The world appears in a constant state of flux and, because of this, thereis no possibility of being able to predict. To end the madness, a new worldview isneeded to regain some sense of stability.Worldviews are changed by outside forces as well often associated with trauma,crises, or changes in consensus reality and is bound to occur particularly if theoriginal is very rigid in nature. Some of these changes may take place quietlythrough choices, although somewhat rarer and more difficult to obtain a completebreak from one’s own worldview, can also be effective. The adoption into certain"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views11religious brotherhoods such as monasteries, for example, or into certain militaryservices (particularly mercenary or undercover groups) is a personal choice thatsometimes requires/ forces a complete break from one’s own past which may include,then, the changing of how one perceives the world.Other changes occur somewhat more abruptly. Folks in this position occasionallybelong to very strict, fundamentalist traditions which sometimes make it very diffi-cult for the individuals to accept change. These folks try to divide their world intoeither black or white, and when confronted with too many verygreytones, begin tofeel the stability of their existence (i.e. their worldview) slip away. This can becomean impetus for them to renew their relationship to their worldview, or will eventuallyopen the doorway into chaos. In this way, religious fervor can override the tenetsof the religion itself to become the driving force behind religious wars promotingterrorism or genocide. This is probably what is also behind the proverbial “wildnessof the preacher’s daughter” (if it’s not a proverb it should be) with the rigid sexualityof early upbringing being ousted by puberty, and also behind the idea that peopleattending universities tend to fall away from their previous religious convictions.Members from both these groups get a little bit away from the nest that they wereraised in and begin to discover that the world is a little more complex than sayingprayers and attending service. Science and scientific discoveries, especially at therapid pace that they are being presented in the latter half of the 20thcentury, oftenconflict greatly with rigidly structured religion; thus the ongoing battle between thescientists/ evolutionists and the Creationists.It is not a battle for truth or even for reality; it is a battle between worldviews.Truthexistsas a part of reality, and no matter how people choose to interpretit,truth, in and of itself, exists. So the battle between a Right-to-Lifer and aRight-to-Chooser is really little more than a skirmish to determine whose opinionhas more supporters, more weapons, more voters, classier slogans, more charismaticspeakers, and better written propaganda, and has nothing to do with truth or withreality since these things will continue to exist no matter which side is eliminated,exterminated, or just beaten to a pulp. The battle between Creationists and theevolutionists is really no more important than whether the Dewey Decimal Systemis better than the Library of Congress or whether one walks 6 miles as opposedto 10 kilometers. Both groups are simply vying for the temporary (and arbitrary)position of “King of the Hill,” and the stability (if any) offered by His Royal albeitTransient Highness is fleeting.Stability comes in different flavors. If reality can be divided into an inner oran internal reality and an external reality, stability then is the one being equallymatched against the other. In some worldviews, the external is assumed to bestatic and non-evolving, so if any mismatch occurs, it is an internal problem, i.e."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views12psychological or spiritual. In other worldviews, the opposite happens, so that whenanything goes wrong the problem and the answer to the problem lies somewhereoutside the self. These are the two extremes, however, and most worldviews will liesomewhere on the continuum in between. In general, the only “dangerous” way ofviewing the world is through the idea that neither changes, in other words, through avery rigid and, consequently, non-tolerant, inflexible, and, therefore, fragile system.When one holds such a view, eventual instability is inevitable.According to some of the more modern psychological theories, small instabilitiesoccur all the time and are dealt with at almost an unconscious level. For thesethinkers, this is the “learning process.” Arnold and Amy Mindell, a husband andwife team of psychologists, call the point where instability is reached anedge,apoint where some type of change must occur to continue, and they maintain thatfor balance or reconciliation to be attained, onemustcross the edge. In their system,the edge is always marked by a guardian who must be overcome.“An edge is a filter to what you are perceiving. It marks the limits ofwho you are and what you imagine yourself capable of. It describes yourcapacities in a particular channel at a given moment.“Edges are a core issue in working with yourself because when you cometo an edge, you lose your perceptions. You suspect, you even somehow know,that some signal or some feeling is there, but for some reason you cannot let itin. You get confused. You know that something’s there, but you don’t seemto be fully aware of it. You have to ask again and again what’s happening.You forget things, and get embarrassed and mixed up at the edge.”3Mindell goes on to explain that the reason that “the edge” is so important is thatthe identity of the individual, i.e. the “ego” and how it relates to the rest of theworld, or the entire worldview is affected:“These edges are really important. . . because your whole identity asa person is called into question. The edge protects and conserves your oldidentity. Making that identity change isn’t very simple; it usually involves ahuge crisis.“There are all sorts of methods for getting across that edge.”4For many of the so-called newer scientists,not crossingthe edge can be dangerous toone’s mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health and that the way to wholenessis over the edge. In their writings the Mindells’ describe several methods for accom-plishing this, one of which is to “battle theedge figure,” a personification of one’s3Arnold and Amy Mindell,Riding the Horse Backwards: Process work in theory and practice,(Penguin Books, London), 1992, p.43.4ibid.,p. 46."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views13confrontation with instability. Some worldviews will consider theedge figureto bean internal or psychological construct while others consider it to be external withas much validity and physical density as anything else within consensus reality. Inthe past, as well as in the present, traditional cultures have had, and some continueto have, ways in which one who had come to the “big edge” could cross over intothe unknown, could become healed and could return to his or her community withthe message of healing. In most of the circumpolar cultures, for example, the onewho had returned was labeled “shaman.” For the Samí (Laplanders), such a onewas callednoaideorofelaš(the first term means ‘shaman’ and the second meansthe ‘pathfinder’). These individuals were often leaders and led their people ontopaths of wholesomeness, health and prosperity; they cared for the community andfunctioned as its guide. In other cultures, particularly of the temperate zones, thecommunity was led usually by a king who was the earthly representative of the luckand power of the community. In these temperate cultures, the one who stepped overthe edge and was able to return from the unknown was the healer (ASheliand=“healer” or the “one who heals”). This book deals with crossing over the “big edge”as handled by the Germanic peoples; it does not deal with shamans, but rather the“Wholemaker.”There are several reasons for my putting together this book now. On a personallevel, I have been cultivating the worldview of the Wholemaker for almost 30 years.It is a functional one in that I am able to fit comfortably into the latter half of the20thand first part of the 21stcenturies. My day job is in the field of mental health;I am well trained in science. I am quite happy with the fact that I am less than1/16 Native American and am of more than 3/4 northern and western Germanic.My people have been in the United States of America for less than 150 yrs. and, asfar as I know, no one in my family has ever done anything to merit a place inWho’sWho,Guiness Book of World Records, or even the front page of the local newspaper.About a dozen or so years ago, I met one of those “edge guardians” that theMindells write about, suffered for it, questioned my own place in history and thenmoved on. Somehow I had moved through a state of internal chaos (and quite a bit ofexternal chaos as well), and at the breaking point, I was “healed.” I can rememberyears spent chasing dreams and rainbows, wishing one day that I had been bornNative American, or that I could be famous or , at least, descended from someoneof fame or nobility. I remember seeing the movieRootsand remember how I longedforroots, too. My life was a pretense, and at one single point, the fragile pretensewas exposed. I was left with nothing, or almost nothing: I had my Germanic studiesand my mixed bag of a personal history. It was as if I had one Well of Information,and through all those years of pretending, the well had become so overgrown and"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views14filled with garbage that I had no idea of its depth or of the richness of its waters.This book then grew out of my own clean up exercise.Secondly, this book is dedicated to those whom I’ve come across over the yearsstanding frozen at the same crossroads that I stood at. They are scared to lookbehind themselves into their own histories because of what they may discover: theirlives have been a pretense as well. Many have gone on to clean up their own wells andhave become satisfied citizens of the 20th and 21st centuries. That is what healingis about in this book: bringing one to a state of stable satisfaction, satisfaction thattheir lives are their own and satisfaction that their lives have some kind of meaningin the overall scheme of things.This book wanders and its focus becomes very dim at some points. This isbecause it is a reflection of my process of coming into a state of wholeness. I’veworked in health related fields for almost 20 years now and never have I seen anyonesimply make a beeline into a perfect state of health. There are always meanderings,ponderings, backtrackings, and wanderings. The reader is forewarned. There arealso areas rich in technical details while other areas may show either lack of knowl-edge about certain topics, lack of understanding or simply what appears to be wildspeculation. The book may even seem incomplete at times. No matter, again itreflects my life which I consider to be in common parlance awork in progress.Some words of caution are necessary. The underlayer of this work is Germanichistory, but the accuracy of this worldview should be drawn into question. Exactly,how accurate can anyone be that a complete version of this worldview even exists?The fact is that no one can. It is not as though the traditions have continued downthrough the ages in an unbroken fashion like Buddhism, for example. Therefore,no such claim is being made here. Secondly, there does not appear to have beenanything like a pan-Germanic tradition; rather, traditions were localized in bothtime and space. The traditions of one town were not necessarily those of the nexttown over, and the traditions in a town in 950 CE may have differed significantlyfrom the traditions in the same town 50 years earlier. Thirdly, it is very difficult(perhaps impossible) to discuss traditions in and of themselves; one needs some kindof standard to compare them against, and that standard will almost always be thestandards set by the society/ culture through which the discussion comes. In thiscase, the discussion is by 20th century standards. Concepts which are completelyunknown or are at least very foreign to a culture needs analogies (comparisons) bothfor definition and explanation, and while one part of the comparison comes froman ancient Germanic tradition the other part comes out of consensus reality5, i.e.5”Consensus reality” is a term which will reappear throughout this entire book and its meaningwill depend upon the context in which it appears. It means ”a reality upon which a specified anddefined group of individuals agree upon.” Consensus reality for Christians is that ”God made"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views15the reality that the readers all agree upon. Let the reader be forewarned then, thisauthor makes no qualms about the Germanic world view as presented in this bookbeingresurrectedandreconstructedand, furthermore, can only speculate with thereader as to the accuracy of the information contained in these pages even thoughevery attempt was made to keep interpretation to a minimum.6The inherent danger, then, in reviving then following any tradition is that thetradition itself becomes dogmatic. There is something pleasant and comfortingabout engaging in ritualistic acts, but if the meaning becomes lost, the tradition iseither dead or might as well be dead. A poem by a Chinese Taoist goes“Watching a performance of warriors, I was told’This fighters tradition is600 years old.’And I saw a performance so mired in ritual–As if nothing valid had happened in 600 years.We must honor the classical without being irrelavent.”7The point is valid. Even many of the newer movements have become “so mired inritual” that its purpose is no longer known. The bulk of Christianity, much of theBuddhist, and even some of the more modern traditions such as Wicca have becometired and meaningless. There will always be a few who will attempt to revive themeanings of tradition, but these become quickly lost because of the familiar comfortthat ritual itself provides. This book discusses meaning behind Germanic traditionsin the hopes that some of the readers will pick up those meanings and be able toapply them in their lives today. Deng Ming-Dao comments on his poem by saying“The adherents [of a tradition] must be fully capable of manifesting the greatnessof their tradition in contemporary settings. If some says that they are an expertin traditional medicine, then they [sic] must be able to heal others today. . . . Ifsomeone says that they [sic] have mastered esoteric spiritual traditions, then theymust be able to manifest the spirit of that spiritual power today” (ibid.). Therethe world,” and for atheists, it is that ”the world came into being by chance as a by-product ofother processes which were taking place in the universe.” Individual differences always occur but”consensus reality” is a set of similarities which binds a group of individuals together.6Every attempt was made in the preparation of this book to keep out highly speculativeinformation. The author, on the other hand, is not a scholar in any area of Germanic history,literature, poetry, etc., and, so, if information has crept into the text which is more of the ”fantasygenre” as opposed to well-documented fact, the author offers his humblest apologies and is willingto stand corrected.7Deng Ming-Dao,365Meditations, (HarperSanFransisco, San Fransisco), 1992, p. 342."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. World Views16is no point in creating a new set of rituals for the 21st century because they willonly become dogma ina few short years. On the other hand, there is a richness instudying the worldview of one’s ancestors—acting through that worldview providesone a place in a long of tradition, and it is in thisplacethat people can find comfort.There are movements, at least in the United States, in several different directionswhich justify the writing of such a book now. First, there is the movement whichnot only places one into an ancestral lineage in terms of race, color, language, family,culture and tradition, but which also encourages humble pride and the senses of com-fort and of belonging to something greater than oneself. There is also the spiritualtradition as well; where one’s “ancestral-roots” offer a place within the communityof man, the “spiritual tradition” offers one a place in the cosmos. Anglo-Europeanshave too long been filling these needs by “inventing” historical roots and traditionsby creating “traditional cultures,” such as the 50 year old religion of Wicca,8or byfollowing spiritual paths which really have nothing to do with their own “roots,” suchas the so-called ”Red-Road” of the Native American or Voudoun of Creole-Haitianall the while justifying their actions by stating that these spiritual traditions areuniversal. Lastly, then, this book is written for those of Anglo-European extractionwho are searching for beauty, comfort, and a sense of belonging both to the diversecommunity of man and to the cosmos at large.Many books are designed to bepure discipline through ritual–there is very littleof that here; Germanic tradition is not really much about discipline/ ritual–for thatone can purchase paperbacks on any of the 85 different flavors of Wicca or it’s thinlydisguised derivatives; it is more about adventure. Life, for the ancient Germanicpeoples, was not to be a drudgery or, as is often presented in the modern Christianworldview, a test or a ’cross to bear.” Life was and can still be a vast unchartedsea full of creatures never before seen and events never before participated in. Theexplorers fare forth into the unknown and bring back health, wisdom and wholenessto their respective communities. The disciplines of this cultural tradition allow oneto navigate the chaos with a sense of strength and the ability to survive.In 986 CE Bjarni Herjolfson sailed out from Iceland bound for Greenland afterhaving heard it described by others. After several days of sailing, the ship becamelost in a windless fog. He came to three different lands to the west (one of whichwas Vínland or North America; the other two are still unidentified), and none wereconsistent with what he had heard about Greenland. Immediately thereafter, hisship was overtaken by a strong gale which lasted for four days. It took all the8Invented by Gerald Gardener ca. 1949 out of pieces of Anglo-European traditions well mixedand smoothed over with pieces from Leland’sAradia: Gospel of the Witches, Margret Murray’sThe Horned God,and Robert GravesThe White Goddessand just a dash of Freemasonry.

Thistime luck had finally brought them to the land they sought: Greenland, the adoptedhome of his father, Herjolf Bardarson.9It is this spirit of adventure matched withskills borne out of discipline that readers will need.9This tale comes from theGroenlendinga Sagatranslated by Magnus Magnusson and Her-mann Pálsson inThe Vinland Sagas: The Norse Discovery of America(Penguin Books, London),1965, pp. 51-55."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter 2ConnectionsMost modern folk tend to think of time and space as being an immutable partof reality, something that cannot possibly be changed or altered in any way, and the20thcentury American culture is no exception to the rule.

They put money into IRA’s, investin stocks, and save for their children’s college funds. Additionally, 20thcentury folkhave a tendency to worry and depress themselves about future events, becomingpsychologically and physically sick over the upcoming nuclear war, entropy, theinevitable economic depression, and the decay of society and disappearance of socialmores. Americans, as well as members of many other industrialized nations, live forthe future, and this is their reality.Cultures which have continued to place more importance on past events thanon the future are often considered “backwards” or ‘primitive” by modern standards,and anyone who seriously proposes that the modern concepts of linear time andthree-dimensional space may not be the only form of reality is deemed by the massesto be living in a fantasy world rather than in “true” reality.

Connections19in fact, its perception of time and space is little more than a mental construct, aninterpretation, an arbitrarily constructed system for the storage of information, orpossibly just a hallucination, having no more or less to do with “reality” than themental construct/ worldview of a Tibetan Lama, a South American witch-doctor,a Fundamentalist/ Creationist preacher, or a schizophrenic. Stepping outside this20thcentury worldview, however, is often difficult, not because one is movingback-wardsto more primitive thinking, but because such a move is not very sociallyacceptable and because the rigidity of modern thinking does not allow for shiftsoutside its concept of reality. Rather than having to experience resistance to shift-ing the way one thinks about reality, simple open-mindedness is exactly what isnecessary to understand the world as the ancient Germanic people saw it. It is nota step backwards, but a step laterally into a different but equally viable frameworkfor perception and storage of information.The ancient Germanic concepts of time and space differed greatly from those ofmodern man. Paul Bauschatz in hisThe Well and the Tree: World and Time inEarly Germanic Culture1a series of well thought out essays presents his interpreta-tion of worldview of the ancient Scandinavians which differs greatly from, and evenstands in direct opposition to, many modern paradigms, at least those within theindustrialized nations of the 20thcentury. His thesis is that the ancient Teutonicpeople held a concept that all within the known and unknown sectors of the Universeis encompassed in a World Tree and thattimeandspace, and even the World Treeitself, are but out-pourings of a spring or well from which that Tree sprang forthand was fed. His essays also aptly show how, society, religion, and the philosophyof that period of time were all tied together within this single concept.“The worlds of men, Gods, and other beings are directly expressed by theTree. Ultimately, however, all significant worldly concerns (concerns of theTree) are related and structured by that part of the cosmos configured bythe Well [the Well of Urð], which expresses that portion of universal realitylying beyond the direct reach of worldly, Tree-related beings, be they men,Gods, or others. The iconography of the Tree and Well mutually interact andsupport each other. The action of men, Gods, and other beings layer and1Paul Bauschatz in his landmark book presents the philosophical background for much ofthis chapter, and his work is quoted here often. If any book is a preliminary to this one, it isBauschatz’. However, the reader is cautioned that his writing style is very dense and the materialcovered is highly academic so that reading is often slow and laborious. I spent several years tryingto make my way through all the material and to understand it. Additionally, Bauschatz’ work wasprimarily literary in nature and was never meant to be a springboard for a practical worldview."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections20fill the Well, and these layering strata themselves structure and influence theaffairs of men.”2Bauschatz writes, however, from the angle of a literary critic and offers only asmattering of information which could lead to the practical application of such aworldview. On the other hand, such a world-view was apparently normal to theeveryday life of the ancient Teutons, in general, and may have been necessary to thework of their Cunning Folk3or Healers/ Whole-makers,4in particular. To under-stand Bauschatz, it is mandatory that one withhold any preconceived ideas aboutthe nature of space and time as it pertains to the average person, and because thisrequires a fairly large shift in the perception of reality from that which is commonlyaccepted in the 20thcentury, some explanation, description, and discussion areprobably necessary.Because 20thcentury society is extremely literate and because much has beenwritten in the past 50 years on what has been called the “East/ West Connection,”those seeking to interpret the spiritual path of the ancient northern Europeans oftenhave a difficult timenotincorporating the prejudices of the modern worldview intotheir understanding of the philosophies of northern Europe. There are phenomenawhich are described and defined extensively in modern books on spiritualism/ reli-gion/ New Age, such as reincarnation, out-of-body experiences, karma, and UFOs,which are occasionally “tacked on” to Germanic spiritual philosophy. This typeof patchwork is unnecessary. The Germanic worldview handles these phenomenaquite well, and there is no need to dilute the beauty and richness borne in theSaga-Masters’ minds. One simply needs to look deep enough into the system it-self! How these phenomena are stored within the Germanic worldview and howthey relate to other events within it often results in explanations, definitions, anddescriptions which differ greatly from the “Eastern view,” for example, but there isno need to generate the “patchwork quilt” philosophy so common today. The systemof the northern Europeans has always been complete in itself.An important feature of the ancient Germanic worldview that is often overlookedin modern discussions about northern folklore, anthropology, sociology, psychology,2Paul Bauschatz,The Well and the Tree: World and Time in Germanic Culture(Universityof Mass. Press), p. 19, 1982.3Cunning Folk is a loose translation of the wordsfjölkyngi(”much knowing” or ”much knowl-edge” or, possibly, ”knowledge of the many things”) andkloka män(”clever man”: cognate inmodern Germankluger man).4”Wholemaker” is a modern term based on the Anglo-Saxon epithet for Christ the ”Savior,”Heliand, which basically translates as the ”Primary” or ”Best of Healers.” In modern German, thephrasezum Heil machenmeans to make ”well” or ”whole.” Because these words all stem from thesame Indo-European root-word, the term ”Wholemaker” was developed and is used in this textwith ”whole” in its very broadest sense."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections21etc. is that these ancient folk were concerned with thehistoryof an object. Noobject, no ‘thing,’ could be presented, given, bought, borrowed or stolen which didnot have a history tightly bound to it, trailing like a ribbon behind it, far intothe past. Historical qualities of an object such as its sentimental value, sordidness,luckiness, or its inherent evil could be, and often were, far more important than itsactual function in daily life. The idea of underlying or “hidden” relationships withinall that is permeated the entire system of northern thought, showing up initially inthe eddaic5descriptions of the Creation of the universe, weaving an intricate patternof relationships throughout the sagaic literature and begins to slowly lose importancelong after the conversion to Christianity. In fact, vestiges of this concept continue tothis day although “keeping an object for sentimental value” is generally consideredfrivolous and somewhat “silly.” The tradition of attending to the history of an event,person, place, or and object is persistent and tenacious, but the importance has beenlost.Restoration of the importance of relationships, connections, and underlying cur-rents is not to be overlooked; it is the core of the ancient northern philosophy.Without an understanding of the dynamic concepts of space and time, the philos-ophy itself is little more than a collection of fairy tales, the mental meanderings ofan ancient people. On the other hand, being able to visualize the central role thatthe World Tree/ Sacred Spring complex plays in the entire thought system bringslife to the old philosophy allowing it to bloom in all its richness and detail. And, asin all great undertakings, it is necessary to start with the beginning.A Tale of the BeginningIn the beginning there were two realms. Far to the north lay Niflheim,the frozen, primal land of ice and snow, in the heart of which lay the Spring,Hvergelmir. From that Spring or Well flowed the eleven rivers, the Élivágar:Svól and Gunnþrá, Fjörm and Fimbulþul, Slíðr and Hríð, Sylgr, Ylgr, Víð,Leiptr, and Gjöll. Far to the south lay Muspell, the hot land of fire, forthfrom which shot sparks and flame. Between the two realms lay Ginnunga-gap, the great vast emptiness which separated the two. The icy rivers, theÉlivágar, flowed into the gaping void meeting Muspell’s spark and flame, and5Here we are making an assumption that the poems of the Elder Edda or Sæmander Eddaare actually older than the family sagas. The actual physical, written versions of the collectionof poetry known as the Elder Edda were written later than some of the mythological and familysagas. The source material of the Edda appears to be older in origin than that in sagaic literature,while some of the poetry itself is in reality younger than the saga material; hence, the assumptionis based on source."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections22the intertwining of the two wove swirls of ever shifting fog, ice and hoarfrost,always shifting from ice to water, to fog, and back again; constantly changing,building, growing, and falling back upon itself. This was the first Current, andwith the constant roiling of fire and the Élivágar’s poisonous waters and ice,life quickened and grew into the first being, the giant called Ymir. Thus,began the second Current or the first of a long lineage of beings.The rime-frost kept moving and shifting, and from it another being wasformed: the cow, Auðhumbla, who fed on the frothy, frozen brine. From Herteats flowed four mighty rivers of milk upon which Ymir was fed. On the firstday as Auð humbla licked away at the blocks of ice, the hair of a man appeared;by the second day, a head; and the third day, the entire man. He was calledBuri and was the first of the long lineage of the Gods. The process continuedand after a time, Buri had a son named Bor who eventually married one ofthe daughters of Bolþór (a frost giant), named Bestla. She and Bor had threesons: Óðinn, Vili, and Vé.The three sons bore no love for the frost giants, and after a time, theykilled Ymir. The blood from his wounds flooded the land of the frost giantsand killed all except Bergelmir and his wife (frost giants) who escaped withtheir lives in a boat made out of the trunk of a tree. The three sons laidYmir’s body in the Ginnungagap, which forms the world. His flesh becamethe Earth (Midgard), his bones became the mountains, his teeth and shards ofbone became the broken boulders that are strewn about. His blood flowed intolow areas becoming the salty seas and, eventually, the lakes of the world. Hisskull was raised up to become the sky. Pieces of brain were thrown up into theair to become clouds, and sparks as they flew out of Muspell were caught upand were tossed up to become the stars, the sun and the moon.. His eyebrowswere raised up from the surface of the earth to become a bulwark separatingMidgard from the Utlands (the Outlands) of Jötunheim.The sun began to warm the rotting flesh of Ymir, and from that newlymade earth all manner of things began to grow. Maggots quickened withinthe flesh becoming dwarves, and other Hidden Folk of the earth. Grass andleeks started, then trees came up, two of which became the first man andwoman.As the brothers were walking one day, they came upon two trees with nofixed fate, neither breathing nor speaking. They had no hair nor fairness offace. Óðinn gave them life’s breath; Vili, mind; and Vé, hair and fairness offace. Thus began the race of men on Midgard, and to them, the three brothersbecame Gods. Here was the beginning of the third Current of the Waters ofLife and the first of the long lineage of people."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections23A third tree rose higher and higher; its roots reached far out into theUtlands with one reaching the Well in Niflheim, Hvergelmir, another to theWell of Mímir in Jötunheim, and a third out as far as the Well of Urð inÁsgard, the newly made city/ home of the three brother/ Gods. The top ofthe growing tree reached to the furthest point in the heavens, the Nail (whichis now called the Pole Star). This tree encompassed all and became known tothe three brother/ Gods as Yggdrasil, to men as Læraþ, and to the giants asMímameið.The Tree which enfolded all things was not safe from the ravages of its inhabi-tants, however. Below the root which extended out over Hvergelmir lay the serpent,Níðhögg and her brood which eats and poisons the Tree from below, and“there is an eagle which sits in the branches of the Ash, and it has knowl-edge of many things, and between its eyes sits a hawk called Vedrfolnir. Asquirrel named Ratatoskr runs up and down through the Ash and carriesmalicious messages between the eagle and Níðhögg. Four stags run in thebranches of the Ash and feed on the foliage. Their names are Dáin, Dvalinn,Duneyr, and Duraþror. And there are so many snakes in Hvergelmir withNíðhögg that no tongue can enumerate them. As it says here: The Ash,Yggdrasil, suffers hardships more than people realize. Stags bite above, andat the sides it rots, Níðhögg eats away at it below.”6From above the hart, Eikþryrnir, ate away at the foliage, and from his antlers fellthe dew (honeydew) back through Midgard, eventually, back down into the Well ofHvergelmir. At the Well of Urð, the three strange women from the Utlands to theEast, the Norns, determined the fate of all things and besprinkled the Tree with thehealing Waters from the Well which served to stave off indefinitely the inevitabledestruction of the Tree. This was the outward appearance of the World Tree (akaYggdrasil or Læraþ)/ Sacred Spring.The Tree both supported and was supported by the force of dynamic tension,a balance between opposing dynamic forces. The ever changing flow of ice out ofNiflheim and the fire which flew out of Muspell kept the Tree and the supportingGinnungagap always in a state of flux much the same as a river that keeps changingits course through the forces of the relentless sameness of the currents.6Snorri SturlusonThe Eddatranslated by Antony Faulkes (Everyman’s Library, London)1987, pp. 18-19.

Connections24The circular aspect of the Flow of the Waters through the Tree has lived onin the collective memory of man and resurfaces periodically, most recently as theAmerican folk concept of the Round River which was rediscovered and explored byAldo Leopold, one of America’s first ecologists, when he described the Earth as a”biosphere” in his collection of essays,The Sand County Almanac.“One of the marvels of early Wisconsin was the Round River, a river thatflowed into itself, and thus sped around and around in a never -ending circuit.Paul Bunyan discovered it, and the Bunyan saga tells how he floated manya log down its restless waters. “No one has suspected Paul of speaking inparables, yet in this instance he did. Wisconsin not only had a Round River,Wisconsin is one. The current is the stream of energy which flows out of thesoil and into the plants, thence into animals, thence back into the soil in anever ending circuit of life. ’Dust unto dust’ is a desiccated version of theRound River concept.”7It would seem that the ancient Germanic peoples somehow naturally sensed theimportance of “dynamic tension” and flux several millennia before the various eco-logical crises of the 20th century forced people to take notice and describe themagain.The upward movement of the Waters of Life pouring out of Hvergelmir wascrucial to the well-being of Læraþ, the World Tree. The Waters flowed out ofNiflheim and up through the capillary structures of the Tree feeding all life as theymoved although this is a gross oversimplification of the process. The primary andoriginal source of the Waters in the pre-Christian Germanic mind was Hvergelmir,and it was only after the Tree had finally grown in place that the other two Wellsappear which serve to further distribute the Waters out to the far reaches of limband leaf.Looking through the filter of the Germanic worldview, movement does notcarrylife with it; “movement” itself is the equivalent of “life.” Waters rise up from a nebu-lous source below and are then distributed (or redistributed) out over Midgard, andbecause of this arrangement, there is a delicate relationship between an underworldand Midgard which has to be maintained. (This need will be more fully discussedin later chapters.) The Waters, once they reach the uppermost Well8, the Well ofUrð, mixed with clay serve to heal the World Tree from the damage caused by the7Leopold, AldoA Sand County Almanac(Sierra Club/ Ballantine Books, New York) 1966,p. 188. There can and will never be enough praise for this man and this work. Anyone wishing toseriously follow the path of ancient Germanic spiritual philosophy will find this book indispensable!8Over the years there have been some rather heated discussions about theactualplacementof the Wells. Frankly, I don’t feel that such an argument merits discussion here. The point isOfcourse, a Well can exist in the sky! Logic doesn’t apply to worldviews."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections25beings living in its protective branches, and they then fell back through Midgard,the underworld, and fed back into the original Well, Hvergelmir, in the form of dewwhich dripped from the antlers of the celestial hart, Eikþryrnir. In this way, theentire Tree was pulled into the healing process from the very top to the lowest rootover Niflheim.Bauschatz feels that the Wells were actually lumped together as one which hecallsUrth Well[sic] or Well of Wyrd. I’m not sure how necessary it is to go tosuch an extreme. The purpose (as a source of dynamic flow) is served with eitherone or three Wells (the number 3has more of a classical Germanic ring to it), butclouds could function as the source of flow without changing or adversely affectingthe worldview itself. One, two, or three Wells—the number matters little. Numberarguments show up in modern literature fairly often. Number, position in space, anddetails of history all seem to vary throughout the Germanic realm depending uponthe period of time in which the piece was recorded, and where the piece originated.Modern folk are wont to lay some importance on qualities like number, color, timeof day, etc. but this type of detail is better suited to more classical mythology likeRoman or Greek; the northern Europeans come across as being far more utilitarianin their approach to almost everything. The most pertinent point to the discussionhere is that the universe was viewed as points around which life-giving waters flowed;rather than a sterile rock, the universe was more like an archipelago.One area of detail which plays an interesting figure, however, is that the shapeof the Waters, their essence, was altered as they passed through each Well. Theoriginal function or purpose was that ofmovementorlife, but, over time, they wererecast in the form of “universal medicine” as they passed through the Well of Urð,and the alteration in the Land of the Giants at the Well of Mímir was the additionof wisdom. Óðinn drank from the Giant’s Well and the wisdom He obtained wasnot the ordinary ”intelligence” of the 21stcentury academician but the wisdom ofthe Tree/ Waters complex, knowledge of the past and present, and this wisdomflowed out in all directions. The Waters which were transformed in the Well ofMímir carried information from the Lands of the Gods, Men, and Giants, and afterthe transformation were spilled back out over the Lands within the Tree much thesame as elsewhere in the mythological cycle, the contents of Óðroerir,9the mead ofpoetry, was spilt back out onto Midgard.“The iconography locates wisdom in the well but imparts it to the Treethrough the reciprocal relationship between the two. A knowledge of the9The Mead of Poetry refers to a draft of magical mead (the Mead of Wisdom) spilt by Óðínnupon Midgard which became the impetus for poetic inspiration. See Faulkes translation ofTheEddapp. 62-64."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections26workings of Urð will lead one to wisdom, and the Eddas imply that suchknowledge is not easily gained.”10Knowledge or wisdom then was another characteristic of the Waters flowing up andout of Hvergelmir as they passed through the Wells of Mímir and Urð: knowledgeof movement.The ancient Scandinavians had a very simple periodic table of elements: fire andice combined to form everything in the Universe. From the standpoint of our modernworldview this sounds like a metaphor, but from the worldview being presented here,it is not. It wasfact. The current way of expressing the same thing, however, isE=MC2; mass, or “things,” is equal to the amount of energy divided by the speedof light squared. Now, it would be ridiculous to even suggest that early Germanicpeoples had some understanding of the Theory of Relativity (this is a type of tacticalcomparison often used by New Age writers: pure and utter nonsense), but they didhave some feeling that what was experienced on Midgard was an expression of energy(fire) and mass (ice) and the way they communicated this was through the use ofpoetic language to describe something that was to them real but intangible. Thepoint here is that the modern Cunning Man11, the scientist, is privy to the wisdomthat what is experienced is part and parcel of the human perceptual system and, assuch, is part of reality.It is interesting that the average man, utilizing the common 20thcentury world-view, feels his life is separate from the rest of Creation and, because of this, feelshimself to be individually important. On the other hand, scientists, as well aspeople following some of the more primitive spiritual paths, know (as part of theirworldview) that all “things” are related, or in other terms, little more than swirls andeddies within the flow of the Waters of Life whether they choose to label them God,the Tao, or simply Energy (with a capital einsteinian “E”) –nothing more than littlepools of mass and energy. They know that all things are constantly in a state offlux, ever moving and changing, and that the feeling of being separate from the restof the Universe is an illusion, or a corporeal metaphor, resulting from reality havingto be filtered through the human perceptual system. The feeling that things, events,or people have some kind of stability, some kind of physical realness, comes fromhow one whirlpool within Round River relates to another, and, if the relationshipchanges between two of these swirls in the Waters, the things themselves appearto change. A normal human changes the complete lining of his stomach every sixdays but does not notice the change because no relationships have changed; on theother hand, a dead animal as it decays appears to change because its relationshipto the rest of the universe has changed: parts have been exhausted as gasses, other10Bauschatz, p. 23.11”Cunning man” is a translation ofKlocka män."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections27parts go through chemical/ physiological changes. Everything, then, according toall these worldviews, is an expression of relationships: how one whirlpool of cosmicmass/ energy interacts with another. All things between Niflheim and Muspellfor the ancient northern Europeans were an expression of the flow of Waters, eventhe Gods themselves who were born of Buri who was released from the rime byAuðhumbla who, in turn, was born of the frozen brine formed at the meeting of fireand ice. E=MC2.Actually, fire and ice as the primal elements makes perfectly good sense. Muchof Scandinavia and Iceland were volcanicly active during the early centuries whenIceland was formed. Such images in nature are never taken lightly. Explosionsof lava when a flow crosses into an ice-field. Geysers, sparks, mud-pots, steamvents, and smoke interacting with the cold turn quickly into intricate white fernsof hoarfrost, the hissing, grinding, booming, ear-deafening “Cracks!,” squeals, andscreeches mixed with lung-burning fumes and smoke, and when all is quiet again,there is land or changes in the land which did not exist before. Within a few shortyears, new, rocky land springs to life and is covered with grasses, flowers, grazinganimals, birds, and eventually people. Observations of these phenomena are rarein the sagaic literature but show up in the eddaic poetry particularly those poemsdealing with cosmology.As mentioned earlier, merely being able to discuss connections between thingsin northern Germanic terms is all well and good but rather like trivia. Great forshowing off at parties. Ideas are merely ideas until they can be effectively (andusefully) applied in the present. Understanding that simply altering the relationshipbetween two or more objects will effect changes in the objects themselves, andsometimes these changes can be very great.The idea goes like this:I get into an argument with two other people. Now, these two people are firmlyconvinced that my position is incorrect so the chances of my convincing these twoare rather slim. For example, we might be arguing about an emotional topic like‘abortion.’ The argument can lead to a firm dislike possibly even moving into therealm of potential “enemies.” I have no chance of winning them over. If I wantto maintain a functional relationship with these people, I might opt to alter myrelationship to them. Since I probably won’t be engaging in an action which willinvolve the 3 of us in an abortion, I may wish to drop the seriousness of my tone."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections28The result will be a lessening in the tension between us and will allow for, at least,acceptable working conditions.The idea of altering the relationship between things to alter the end productworks. My own personal difficulty is that I like to think that I am right much of thetime, and it rarely occurs to me to simply drop the seriousness of the topic. I workwith handicapped children a lot, and they can often be a challenge behaviorally. Ihad a professor who sensed my frustration so he described to me a pair of conceptswhich he called “First and Second Order Change.” A first order change was whatI was trying to do most of the time; that is, I was trying to force the child tosimply alter his behavioral pattern, such as screaming at the top of his lungs, atmy request. When the request failed, I would try again and again, and of course,I failed. My professor suggested a different tack, a second order change—screamwith(notat) the child, for example. Find out how it felt to scream. Perhaps theacoustics in the room are interesting. Perhaps the acoustics of the voice. Maybe itfeels good to stretch the limits of the vocal system. Who knows, but altering mybehavior worked and was far less frustrating to both of us than my original method.Changing relationships between things produces an altered set of results (though,perhaps, not quite as predictable).The Germanic idea offjölkonngi12(ON.,trans.sorcery, literally “much knowl-edge”) may have had something to do with this idea of altering relationships betweenthings. Not much is known about how Germanic sorcerers went about their jobs, butmany, including myself, suspect that Germanic wizards much like their circumpolarcounterpart, the shaman, used trickery and psychology in addition to their craftto achieve results. The trickery and psychological techniques are important to thecircumpolar shaman because by these (especially if they are done well) the audience’sbelief system is either temporarily or permanently altered. The change in the beliefsystem results in a change in general behavior leading to the individual interactingwith the world differently. The change in interaction, i.e. relationship, results indifferent outcomes. Marionette shows are interesting. Done properly, with the rightlighting, good puppetware, and good puppeteers, the figures present the audiencewith the illusion that one is looking at a slice of real life. People are able to suspendtheir belief that puppets are just lifeless wooden figures and are really dependenton the movement of strings behind the curtain. And children, yes, children “know”that the personages on stage are real within their worldview even after they havebeen shown the strings and the operators; for them the illusion is complete. It’strue that it is difficult to “fool” children when performing a weak stage magic trick(this is common knowledge among stage magicians), but when the trick is “pulled12Fjölkonngiactually means ”much knowledge” but, as the word was used in Old Norse, theword means ”magic” or ”sorcery.” The literal translation serves our purpose well, however."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections29off” the children are fooled utterly and completely whereas adults will often reservesome amount of doubt. But, how curious it is that adults, even those who can laughknowingly about the children, believe in exactly the same way when it comes todealing with the “things” of Midgard.The average man who no longerbelievesin Santa Claus or magic tricksbelievesthat he is looking at a slice of life when he reads theNew York Times, but the trueCunning Man, one who has knowledge of the movement puppet’s strings behind thescenes, knows that the reader is only reacting to what he is visualizing while readingthe paper made to feel real by his emotional response to the visualization rather thanto the event itself. The actual event occurred in another place and another time, butfor the average manreading = experience. Of course, reading about somethingis no morerealthan a stage trick, but for the average man, the trickiscomplete: heis fooled. One should also note here that intelligence has nothing whatsoever to dowith the Cunning Man’s knowledge; one person is simply privy to the action behindthe curtain while the other is not. Reality for the Cunning Man is movement andmass, but for the average man it is only the interpretation of movement and massthat is real; he is completely incapable of looking up and seeing the strings behindthe newspaper story.A term which people often tend to use interchangeably with “knowledge” is “in-telligence.” The average man memorizes long strings of trivia and confuses thisprocess withknowledge. People with true knowledge, however, engage in actionswhich changes underlying relationships, and this in turn results in a change or al-teration of “things” on the surface level. Returning to the analogy of physical realitybeing a marionette show, Cunning Folk are able to act as the stage hands behindthe curtains who change the relationships between the strings so that the puppetson stage actually appear to move and change of their own accord. In this job, theneed for a sense of wholeness is crucial but an advanced degree in microbiology isnot. Intelligence need not be written off, however; it functions as a great lubrica-tion in social settings and can actually be used to fool people into changing theirrelationships to objects or other people, but intelligence does not impress or alterobjects themselves.Obviously, to view reality as a great marionette show is in itself just a worldview,but how does anyoneknowwhat is the correct one? The truth of the matter is thatno one does know which is the right one. No one single worldview is better than anyother (see Chapter 1). The problem is, and always will be, that reality simplyis,and each individual must translate it into something meaningful and useful. Someare content to live within a very small portion of reality and are able to extractall the meaning they will ever need through a very tight rigid translation system,seeing the world as black-and-white or good-vs.-evil, for example; others, if not"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections30most, need something more flexible - a lot ofgreycan fall between black-and-white.To extract the most meaning from life is the criterion for deciding what system orwhich worldview is right. The ancient Germanic folk, then, sensed reality in quitea different fashion than modern man. While modern man’s attention is caught uponly with the world of physical things, the ancient perception of the world was over-lapped with dreams and visions (now, usually called ‘hallucinations’ or ‘figments ofthe imagination’), in other words, perceptions and experiences without the presenceof a physical object. In theTale of the Beginningpeople were created from trees.To continue the metaphor, in our modern worldview, folks have lost the sense of atrunk and a root system which, combined, are the history orlineageof the organismand fall to believing that only thetreetops(i.e.,the outward appearances of things)represent reality, and because of the trivialization of objects’ histories, there is oftena feeling of separateness and alienation from the world. Any “non-treetop” informa-tion which flows up from below, i.e. comes from beyond the normal five senses, isignored or is not regarded as important totreetop reality. In the ancient Germanicworldview, however, the trunk and the root system were still regarded as an integralpart of reality. Knowledge could flow freely from beyond the self upward through alltrunks and, because all trees are nourished in the same earth, allowed for constant,albeit indirect, communication with all other parts of creation. Rather than feelingseparate and alienated, these ancient folk enjoyed an underlying sense of belonging,a sense of community even though they may have been alone much of the time.Of course, the early Teutons used exactly the same five traditional senses thatwe learn about in school and when they focused their attention was still thetreetops,i.e. the world of things. They accepted experience and perceptions coming up from“below” as being part of physical reality. A common concept from northern Europehanded down through folklore and oral history is “second-sight” which can be definedas information received from outside the traditional five senses.“Once they were churning at Vaaland, but they didn’t get any butter.Someone must have bewitched the churn. So they heated the scythe until itwas red hot, and thrust it down in the churn. On the following day, theywent to church, and there they met people from Møgedal. They exchangedgreetings, and the man from Vaaland asked how they were getting along inMøgedal. ‘Oh, not very well,’ said the Møgedal man. ’My wife cut threefingers off one hand.’’Well, it served her right, she was in our churn. We churned the wholeday without getting any butter,’ replied the man from Vaaland.”1313Kvideland and Sehmsdorf,Scandinavian Folk Belief and Legend."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections31Dreams, visions, and omens, then, were as acceptable as sources of knowledge asany experience within consensus physical reality, and this is well documented inboth sagaic and eddaic literature. Knowledge gained in either fashion could beincorporated into any decision making process. For the ordinary person though,action was carried out at the treetop level, the normal point of view.Direct access to knowledge was quite a different matter, and this was the realmof the Cunning Man. The Cunning Man’s or Whole-Maker’s was able to shift hisor her point of view from the treetops to that of the root system itself. Oftenthis person was regarded as something not quite human, something suspicious orperverse, because he or she had forsaken the safety of thetreetops, physical reality,and community to wander in the wilderness of the unknown. The suspicion here,of course, was that all sense of humanness and compassion for others were eitherperverted or lost leaving the individual to be viewed with the same mistrust usuallyreserved for “foreigners.” And, in northern European folk literature, these folk arevery often presented as dwelling on the brink of insanity or, sometimes, completelyover the edge. The motif of the wizard or witch completely consumed by his or herown spirits is very common in the folklore of northern Europe not only among theGermanic people, but also among the Celtic, Balto-Slavic and Finno-Ugric peoples.I tend to think of the Cunning Man as a distant cousin to the Japanese Bonsai-Master.TheBonsai-Masterunderstands that to change the outward appearance of hisminiature tree, actions must take place in the trunk, boughs and roots. The rootsmust be carefully trimmed periodically to effect fuller foliage; bends in the entiretree must start with the relationship between the trunk and root; and for the truemaster, the relationship between tree, pot or tray, rocks, dirt and moss is importantfor the overall effect so a tree may be carefully placed to one side and a rock turnedjust so before the tree is deemed presentable. The Cunning Man then had to haveaccess to knowledge of trunks and roots as well.The ancient Germanic peoples had developed several techniques to help themengage in proper action14without actually having direct access to knowledge. Thisshould not be confused with the idea that they acted out of ignorance; they didnot. They engaged in proper action which allowed them to function as an integralpart of the World Tree and its Flowing Waters, and by doing so they gained accessto luck and power which brought meaning and comfort to their lives, prosperity totheir fields, some assurance that the ground was made ready for their descendants.They were able to do this through the proper use of ritual/ ritualistic behaviorsuch as leaving out food for the Ancestors or the elves, attending to taboos suchas avoiding certain regions, certain acts, or certain foods, or observing holidays in14Proper action is based onknowledgeas opposed to that based on intelligence or simplereaction."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections32a manner which was consistent with their community and their time. They gainedtheir knowledge through close observations of the things of their world, the WorldTree, such as the behaviors of horses, the flight of birds, and other omens. Directaccess to the knowledge of the Well of Mímir was only for those few who weredestined by their lineage:“. . . men do not know directly anything of the nature of the reality ofthe well. It is clear, though, that it is, in opposition to tree-oriented reality,conceptual rather than physical, abstract rather than three-dimensionallyreal. Within the well, the interrelations among actions rather than actionsthemselves are of paramount importance; here, within the realm of the well,are the motives and reasons for and the final causes of the acts that occurwithin the realm of the tree. Within the well, the power of all events past stillsurges, writhes, twists, whelms, and weaves the whole of this greater reality‘out’.”15Although most of the ancients may not have been able to “look up and see the stringsoperating the cosmic puppet show,” by engaging in proper action as defined in theiroverall worldview, they were able to live out their lives within the community withfew problems. When need arose, the Cunning Man was usually available, to crawl upbehind the scenes and untangle snags and knots. For the early Germanic peoples weknow that this had much to do with the loss of luck, health, missing farm animals,irrational fears, and unexplainable ill health.Germanic ritualistic behavior was “proper action” which served to groom andstrengthen relationships between men and men, men and Gods, men and the ances-tors, and men and the forces of nature. Thesymbelor “sumble” as it is now written,according to Bauschatz, served to relate man to man through the ritualized sharingof drink, oath-making, and gift-giving:“No Gods are mentioned in the Germanic feast; indeed, the symbel doesnot seem to be an occasion upon which men’s affairs are related to those of theGods. As a matter of fact, a good deal of the material (literary) . . . indicatesthat both men and Gods share the practice of thesymbel. Thus, there areno prayers in the Germanic ritual. In thesymbel\\ldots the emphasis ison drinking, pledging, and swearing oaths. Those taking part directly andliterally associate themselves with the flow of events and hold themselvesresponsible for forthcoming actions.”1615Bauschatz, p. 125.16Bauschatz, pp. 80-81."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections33The ritual of theblót17(pronounced “bloat”) as described by Snorri in the Ynglin-gasaga, however, was the Germanic method for aligning the community with theGod-Powers and the Ancestors. The Julblót, or Christmas as it is called in thepost-conversion era, was a sacred time of celebrating the closeness of the commu-nity of the dead with the Land of the Living, and the álfar-blót, as described in St.’s Saga, most likely dealt with the making or remaking of ties between the world ofman and the guardians of nature. Relationships and connections dominated earlyGermanic religion and thought, and it was necessary to renew these periodically forthe sake of the living.It is important to realize here as well that the terms “ritual” or “ritualistic be-havior” often brings to mind, at least in this modern era, something similar to aformal ceremony. This is not necessarily the case and certainly is not the idea thatthis author is trying to convey. “Ritual” can be something as simple as leavingofferings at certain trees or tipping one’s hat toward specific rocks, or wells whenone visits the vicinity or the setting of an extra serving of food during the courseof a holiday season. Ritualistic behavior in this sense is more akin to a child’s“not-stepping-on-a-crack” type of tradition than to a Catholic mass. Granted, thereare a few descriptions of blóts conducted at certain times of the year such as the Jólblót described in the Heimskringla or large official blóts at the Icelandic Alþing orthe great blót allegedly performed every ninth year at the Vé at Uppsala Gammla,but these are the exception to our discussion rather than the rule. For the most part,when I am discussing “ritual,” I mean minor or private ritualistic behavior unless Ispecify otherwise. Secondly, ritual is a behavior that is dependent and secondary tohow an individual views the world around him and relates specifically to what onedoes to maintain alliance with that world.This is the real function, then, of religion: to systematically realign an individual,a family, or a community with the Powers governing it by allowing one to engage inproper action. The Flow of the Waters of Life passed through the underworld up tothe Land of the Living, but also, the Waters fell from the Heavens and trickled backdown through Midgard into the Land of the Ancestors. As long as the checks andbalances of the flow remained, everyone benefitted. When either the Communityof the Ancestors or of the Living withheld, the other suffered, but there was alsoa “boomerang effect” so that the withholder (initially) became the sufferer (eventu-ally). The situation became “unhealthy,” “unwholesome,” “unholy” and needed to17”Blót” is an Old Norse word which basically means ”a sacrifice.” Snorri describes the killingof the animal and the sprinkling of the attending crowd with the blood from thehlautbollí,or”blood bowl.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

This is the problem:If the early Germanic peoples accepted this idea of balances and checksbetween the different Lands in their worldview, which, by all indications,they did, then shouldn’t there be a single word or concept by which theycalled ”that which is balanced,” this ”power” which supposedly poured forthfrom Hvergelmir?The Polynesians, after all, have the concept ofmana; the Ojibwa havemanitou; theChinese,chi. Sorting through all the literature, eddaic, sagaic, and even modernfolklore, one runs across several terms which seem to indicate some form of localizedpower, but an overall term is lacking. I’ve seen books in the New Age section ofbookstores which apply these foreign terms to the northern Germanic worldview,but the authors admittedly made these deductions themselves. Swain Wodening inhis bookletBeyond Good and Evil: Wyrd and Germanic Heathen Ethics19listsmain(OE =mægen) as “the magical, spiritual, or life force possessed by every human be-ing” (p. vi), and he considers it to be comparable to themanaof the Polynesians andequates it with ”hamingja” of the ancient Scandinavians. Thorsson callshamingja“a magical force” attached to a human being,20even though it is usually definedas a “guardian-spirit” in glossaries, dictionaries, and books on northern mythology,but he does not explain why this force is attached only to human beings and notto mountains, trees, etc. Of course, one can always speculate that trees have a soulbut nohamingja, or that trees are only objects plain and clear, and that being thecase hamingja is a poor candidate as the counterpart tomana. Bauschatz inTheWell and the Treeprovides some very clear evidence that the early Scandinavians18We have not yet discussed the King’s role and how it relates to the role of the Cunning-Man.Whether one became a King or a Cunning-Man really depended on (at least before the Conversionto Christianity) where one lived. The roles and functions relate closely to one another, and as weshall see later, both are instrumental in the luck of the community.19Wodening, SwainBeyond Good and Evil: Wyrd and Germanic Heathen Ethics(EndweorcPress; Watertown, NY) 1994.20Thorsson, EdredFuthark: A Handbook of Rune Magic(Samuel Weiser; York Beach, ME)19 , p. 150."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

In other words, the ancients did not use the wordsin the fashion that the modern writers are intending. Modern writers are clearlylooking for something that translates (or can be translated) as “electricity/ energy”which can be directed, manipulated and utilized to heal as well as deal out deathblows, but what did the ancient Scandinavians think of such a concept? Did theyreally think oföndas a force which can fly like sparks from the fingertips?We moderns can be very creative sometimes. When we get an idea in our headsthat this must be the way a thing was, we whip out Occam’s Razor, bend it in halfand dash it to the ground in the blink of an eye, and then walk away. We are so firmand unwavering in our convictions that when we are faced with a simple fact, we willignore iteven when it comes directly from the source!The study of anthropology isalmost two centuries old now having gotten its start in the late Romantic Era by theearly collectors of folklore. The picture that is drawn by anthropologists of peopleliving in predominately rural areas is that these folk tend not to think in terms ofelectricity, energy, or power but in terms of spirits and ghosts.Hamingja(to bediscussed more fully later) is listed in most good ON dictionaries as a “guardianspirit” whose function was to help access power/ luck;öndorandmeans “breath,”23but in the modern Christian sense it means “holy spirit”;meginrelated to the modernEnglish word ”main” has the sense of “strength or even supernatural strength butin a physical sense” like the “strength” of a berserker, an ox, or a sorcerer.

According to Bauschatz’ work, the World Treeand all it contains are little more than outpourings or an overflow from the initialbattle between the ice rolling out of Niflheim/ Hvergelmir and the sparks flying outof Muspell. The overflow pours into and fills the Ginnungagap (“the gaping void”)as rime (“hoarfrost”) which is quickened by the ever changing tension between thetwo.One can easily speak of, visualize, and understand stagnant ice and fires, but the“quickening” itself is difficult to describe24. Of course, the idea that “ice can live”appears to be completely illogical, unscientific and irrational those of us living inthe modern industrial world. We are scientific. We know for example that wormsor ghosts don’t make us sick, but that it’s virii and bacteria which cause disease.Even though most of us have never actually seen a virus, nevermind having seen avirus infect another organism with a disease, we accept that virii and bacteria existbecause1. the germ theory of disease makes sense,2. diseases are explainable in these terms, and3. the germs respond to medications specifically antibacterial and antiviral.These are good reasons to accept “the germ theory of disease” but oddly enough,the same rationale was used as the basis for magic, charms, the humour theory,homeopathy, Bach Flower Remedies, and naturopathy. The “quickening” of ice isreally not much more mythical, weird, or mystical than that which comes out ofthe long chains of organic proteins to make up DNA. It is fairly simple to give adescription of the chains themselves, but what is it that brings life into the complex?When does the “quickening” occur? The early Scandinavians, in the eddaic poetry,offer the concept of dynamic tension and ever changing balance. They often utilizedthe words “Urð” (ON) or “Wyrd” (OE), but the concept of Wyrd as it is used bythe modern writers of Norse revivalism is only another snapshot of frozen Waters.So far, there is no single term to accurately provide knowledge of something akin to“mana,” “chi,” or “manitou.”Bauschatz in his first essay in The Well and the Tree ran into the same problem.Although his writing style is complex and somewhat difficult to wade through, andalthough he never clearly states the problem (at least not in one sentence), his24To ”quicken” means ”to bring to life.”"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections37response and ensuing discussion fills a full three pages.25The upshot of his presen-tation is that speakers of modern Germanic languages have lost or misplaced theconcept of a universal power which was originally contained in the overall meaningof the Old Norse word “brunnr.” Usually, the word is translated into modernEnglish simply as “well” or “spring,” but something has been lost in the translation.In northern Europe, springs are common and many of them are spectacular in theform of artesian wells, geysers, mineral springs, hot springs, cold springs, etc., andthe general format for naming each type in modern English is “descriptor + ‘spring’.”Furthermore, the word “spring” itself usually denotes simply a water source such asin “spring-fed lake” or “spring-fed river,” etc. For the early Germanic peoples, theterm “brunnr” implied a “spring-complex” as opposed to simply meaning a source ofwater.“The idea of the brunnr- came then to include the enclosure (the walls ofthe well), the water within it, and the powerful, active force that allows it tofill the differing developments of the reflexes of the word in modern languagesshow a separation of these earlier joined attributes.”26Some permutation of the wordbrunnr-is used in almost all modern Germaniclanguages, including English (“burne”), but each of these languages emphasize onlyone of the attributes of the original water–spring–movement complex. The originalmeaning of the word, then, included “movement” and “power” in a single word, butin modern English it is necessary to talk about the spring, the water, and the flow ofwaters separately. The concept of an all pervasive, universal power appears to havebeen most likely contained within the meanings behind the names for the primalWells or Burnes of Hvergelmir (primarily), and Mímir and Urð (secondarily), and,as a consequence, there was no separate term which would translate as “mana” or“chi.” The term settled for in the rest of this book is simply the “Flow of the Waters.”There is another concept which requires some further explanation: “balance.”The word is from the Latin (bi= ”two”;lanx= “a pan”) and is used profusely inbooks on modern occultism and neo-shamanism to mean an equalization of power.It almost seems impossible to talk about the workings of the Cunning Folk or Whole-makers without resorting to the term. Surely, if there was such an occupation asWholemaker there also must have been a word or phrase which essentially meant“to balance” in terms of a universal power or of the Flow of the Waters. (It mustalso be admitted that the word “balance” is used periodically throughout this text.)There is a concept which existed for the ancient Teutons that, likebrunnrfor theconcept of universal energy, stands in the place of “balance.”25Bauschatz, pp. 16-20.26Bauschatz, pp. 17-18."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

ON fem. name‘Olga,’ ‘Helga’ ( = ’holy’).”27Modern writers have come to depend on the concept of balance when talking abouthealing, and to depict the concept, they often resort to the Chinese Yin/ Yang. Thesymbol shows two slightly curved raindrop shapes in perfect balance completelyfilling and surrounded by a circle. Modern writers usually focus on thebalancebetween the two raindrop figures, but the early Germanic spiritual philosophers, atleast in light of thekailoword-complex as described above, apparently focused moreon thewholenessof the circle surrounding the figures.Stephan Glosecki in hisShamanism and Old English Poetryexpanded upon thisconcept of “wholeness” somewhat. He cites several verses from “Beowulf” wheretheskald(ON = “poet”) speaks of Beowulf having to “cleanse” (fælsian= tocleanse or purify) the Hall, Heorot, of the “unholy wight” (OEwiht unhælo=unwholesome or unholy being).28Although Glosecki’s discussion on this topic isshort and rather loose, he clearly demonstrates that the Anglo-Saxon mind-set wasin terms of whole-unwhole, healthy-unhealthy, holy-unholy, and also in terms ofprosperity-dearth, whole-wounded, and lucky-unlucky all related tohæl-unhæl.In another related argument, Glosecki presents the idea that early after thearrival of Christianity to the North, Jesus was deemed the “Healing One” by theEnglish-speaking people through the use of the epithetHeliandrelated to the OEword hælend. It is highly probable that one of the main reasons that Jesus wasacceptable to the early Englanders was because He, as the primary god-figure ofthe religion, was considered the “fore-most Healer,” the One who would maintainthe “wholeness,” “holiness,” “health,” and “prosperity” of the Germanic peoples. Itis also important to note that in some cases, at least early on during the conversion27American Heritage Dictionary,William Morris, ed.(Houghten-Mifflin; Boston) 1978, p.1520.28Glosecki, StephenShamanism in Old English Poetry(Garland Publishing,Inc.; New York)1989, pp. 176-79."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections39to Christianity, people simply accepted the “new God” into their already existentHeathen pantheon rather than dropping their Heathen faith completely.29The concept of “wholeness” is found sprinkled through both Western and North-ern Germanic literature-in the eddaic and sagaic literature from the descriptionof the Tree in the “Völuspá” to the ”healing” (whole-making) of districts such asHrothgar’s kingdom in Beowulf. At the beginning of time, right after the creationof Midgard by Óðinn, Vili, and Vé, there was a war between the two tribes ofGods, the Æsir and the Vanir, which required tricky negotiations and the mutualexchange of hostages to bring the Tree back into “wholeness.” This drive to negotiateand reconcile has been a part of Germanic philosophy since prehistoric times, andit formed the foundation of the wergild system which was a part of the legal systemused for setting things right in a community that had ceased to function in a healthymanner.30Negotiations, reconciliation, and actions taken to put a community backin order included the levying of fines, the removal of something (cf. Grendel in“Beowulf”) or someone as in the case of outlawry, or, most drastically, the actualcomplete changing of a thing from one state of being to another through destructionas in the case of Ymir at the beginning of time or even Ragnarök at the end of time.In the “Völuspá,” thevölvapredicted the end of the Tree wherein life has becomeso intolerable that the only cure is total destruction. In this case, the destructionof something is the catalyst for bringing something back into wholeness.All these actions served the purpose of bringing a “healing” or a harmony backinto a simple unit such as an individual who was ill or a field which was unable toproduce crops, or into a complex unit such as a community or a nation. As canbe seen from the examples cited above, the healer or Wholemaker could easily havebeen a priest, a diplomat, a judge, a warrior, a scientist, a lowly farmer, or a kingand did not need to demonstrate any superior knowledge nor any profound belief; heneeded only to be able to act with knowledge of the ”illness” or “unwholesomeness”and be able to guide the people or land back to a state of “health” or “wholeness.”He needed to engage in “proper action.”So far all that has been discussed is relationships in a horizontal fashion, in otherwords, all within the same time frame, the present, and, essentially, these can be29This dual-faith idea has been well expounded upon by many authors including Turville-PetreinMyth and Religion of the North,H.

Rather than being separated by time, they areseparated by distance only or in what we would call a cause-effect relationship, oneevent leading into another. Complex temporal relationships are often less obviousin the early writings of Germanic culture and are probably somewhat more difficultfor modern man to conceptualize let alone understand. Modern white Americanscan be heard to say, for example, “I had nothing to do with the slave trade; thatwas over a hundred years ago!” in response to remarks made by black Americansabout current living conditions, employment opportunities, and general attitudesof white America towards the black community. Modern folk generate an excuseout of theapparent temporal separationbetween events to absolve themselves fromthe responsibility of engaging in right action; instead, they use this as an excuse toturn their heads away, to ignore racial prejudice. The tired cliché “All that we haveis the present” is another way that people can remove themselves from and blindthemselves to events that have gone before, but such a belief would have seemedodd to an ancient Scandinavian sitting near the fire in a mead hall listening to apoet/ singer recite glorious battle songs composed in honor of a long dead king.For the ancient Teutonic peoples, the past was the very foundation upon whichthe present floats. Events taking place in the past directly determined the statusof the present. For the ancients, the responsibility for past action was not to beignored.“Thence wise maidens three betake them–under spreading boughs their bower stands–Urð one is hight, the other, Verthandi,Skuld the third: they scores did cut,they laws did make, they lives did choose:for the children of men they marked their fates.(Völuspá 20, Hollander, 1962)In the above verse, the Old Norse word usually translated as “fate” isørlög. For thepurposes of poetry, the translation may serve well enough, but from a philosopher’sor a cultural anthropologist’s point of view, “fate” or “fates” is a very poor choice.The ON word,lög, and its companion,lag, are defined in the Glossary to the PoeticEdda thusly:lagn. ’lay,’ order, disposition:heyra lag orða‘to catch the drift of words. In thepl. (lög) a) preordained fate:leggja lög‘to determine someone’s fate’; b) law.lög, seelag(Völuspá 20) andlögr."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections41lögr,m. 1. water, liquid. 2. sea.Although the word is translated as “fate,” one can easily see that the feeling behindthe word is more closely related to “layering” (as in ”silt falling to the bottom of ariver”), “ordering” (as in “the ‘layers’ of silt”), and “water.” Even the phraseheyralag orða(“to understand”) would then translate into something like ”to hear the’layers’ of the words” or ”to hear how the words ’layer’ themselves into meaning.”The prefixør-, which has as its cognate in modern GermanUr-, translates mostliterally as “primal” or “original.” The word,ørlög, then translates as “the mostsignificant things laid down, the earliest things accomplished.”31The Well of Urð, theUrðabrunn, is concerned with movement much the same asthe other Springs, but its outward flow is ordered and layered as opposed to chaoticseething of Hvergelmir. Somehow we have lost the sense of the word “spring.” Aspring in this new millennium brings to mind the image of asmall pondfed byan unknown source, but originally the word was concerned not with thethingthatwe now call a spring, but with the action and movement of the water. The word“spring” is a verb that was used as a noun for so long that it has all but lost its senseof being a verb. In the elder sense of the word, springs dealt with movement andaction which can be translated as the power of the Flow of the Waters through theTree. In the Tale of the Beginning above, the primary flow was to the center of theGinnungagap and up the Tree through the Lands of Giants, Men, and the Gods,but there is also a return flow back downwards which falls as dew from the antlersof the Hart, Eikþryrnir. It is the layering of action and movement into the thirdWell,Urðabrunn, at the beginning of this downward flow that is read each day, i. e.the “history” of the Tree, and the new layers are what becomes “the present,” “theNow.”The early Germanic peoples envisioned and experienced time differently thandoes modern man. They saw the past as being layered into an immense Spring withthe far past being the deepest layers, the immediate past as those layers just belowthe surface, and the surface of the Waters as the present. All that was above thesurface, i.e., had not been layered into the Spring yet was unknown. The surfaceitself had no real existence other than it was the dividing line between that which hadalready happened and that which was yet to be. All actions which were committedfell into the Spring and became layers slowly moving deeper into the past, and likerocks and logs slowly sinking below the surface of a lake, they directly affected theappearance of the surface. Such a conception of temporality is very different fromthe current idea that the past and the present are separate: “Then was then, andnow is now.” For the ancient Germanic people the clichÉ would have to be recastas “All we really have is the past for the present is still not ready yet.”31Bauschatz, p. 7."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections42Knowledge as defined above would also have a different feel to it since to betruly knowledgeable one would not only have to understand the connections betweenthings or events but would also have to know and understand the layering of actions/movements in the Well of Urð and how these layers were affecting the surface/present time.”The phraselög leggjais the usual term in Old Norse for the act of makinglaws, but the literal meaning of the phrase suggests something else.Leggjais ’to lay’, ’to place’, or ’to do’.Lög(the plural oflag) is literally ’strata’ or’that which has been deposited or laid down’.Lög leggjais, then, to lay downthat which has been laid down or to lay down or implant strata. There is astrong feeling of the physical here. Of courselögoccurs again inørlog seggja:‘to say or to speak theør-strata, theør-things-laid-down, theør-law’. Thephrase is usually translated as ‘to set fate’, but fate is a non-Germanic word.If fate’s meaning is to be limited to denoting ‘that which has been spoken’ or‘that which has been laid down’, then it translates the context well; if not, itwill cause problems.”32Knowledge, then, comes from having gained an understanding of the past.Snorri in theProse Eddatells of the Tale of Óðinn’s seeking wisdom from theWell of Mímir:“But under the root that reaches towards the frost-giants, there is whereMímir’s Well is, which has wisdom and intelligence contained in it, and theMaster of the Well is called Mímir. All-father (Óðinn) went there and askedfor a single drink from the Well, but He did not get one until He placed Hiseye as a pledge (into the bottom of the Well).”33One did not gain wisdom or knowledge simply by drinking from the Well; one hadto be able to see the layers/ actions and the currents, the connections, which relateone stratum to another to understand the true make-up of the surface. For Óðinnto have knowledge, His eye had to be left in the Well. Knowledge of the past or“remembering” the events and how they related to one another resulted in “knowing”the present, and this type of knowledge was within the scope of the Wholemaker’sskills. And indeed, it has often been the case, that modern collectors of northernEuropean folklore have found the local “healers” to be some of the best and mostcomplete repositories of local history, geneologies, as well as tales of the Otherworld.The Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages separates itself from otherEuropean languages of the same tree in that it does not have a built-in future tense.32Bauschatz, p. 6.33Snorri, p. 17."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections43To create the sense of the future, it is necessary to utilize modal auxiliaries such as“will” or a form of the present progressive “is going to” preceding the infinitive formof the target verb. Looking back at the “water/ flow/ movement/ power/ action”complex, one will notice immediately that which is above the surface of the water,i.e., the future, does not fall within the constraints of the complex and, therefore, isdevoid of power. For the Germanic people, the future had no real power; it did notexist within the realm of the Well and the Tree.It is the past, the ørlög, which is the shaping force of the present, not the future.The movement of the Waters bubbles upward from the chaotic seething of the Wellof Hvergelmir through the combined actions of Men, Giants, Ancestors, and Godswhich are then laid down in the Well of Urð, chaotic Waters now ordered, and theseeventually find their way back down into Hvergelmir. Every human action performedas part of the present becomes part of the layering process and with action comesresponsibility. Action performed in the benefit of the intertwined Well/ Tree isproper action.Men perform actions which affect the Tree and Flow of the Waters through it.Giants, Gods, Ancestors, Landvættir (land- and water-spirits) only have an effectin that they guide the actions of men either on a conscious or subconscious levelby regulating the Flow of the Waters in the sense of luck/ power, but there is noindication in either the eddaic or sagaic writings that they have any direct effectother than through men. People are led, guided, tricked, conned, forced, or advisedinto action by these ghost-beings usually invisible to the inhabitants of Midgard(except to those with second-sight), but it is only people who are the ones to actuallycommit the acts which are then laid down asørlög. The overall function of the folkof Middle Earth then seems to be as the executors of schemes made by either equalor greater beings. Man’s purpose in the overall plan is to lay down layers of the pastwhich become the foundations of the present.This is not to say that the Gods, Giants, or the Landvættir do notdoanythingfor they obviously do. For the ancients and up to fairly recently, theálfaror theElves , theJötnaror the Giants, and theVanirand some of the Æsir (particularlyThór) have been concerned with the well-being and fecundity of the earth. Weather,the care of certain localities, the fertility of animals, and the fruitfulness of plant-lifehave all fallen under their auspices. Even mankind itself was closely guarded andguided by the Gods, Ancestors, and a variety of other beings. However, it is onlythe actions of men which become theør-layers in theWell of Urðand which changethe nature of the Waters.The idea that the past is the container of power for the present is not spe-cific to the early Germanic culture. The same idea exists around the globe inpre-industrial nations where Christianity is not necessarily the primary religious"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections44philosophy. These cultures, in general, place a great amount of importance on fam-ily lineages, clan-structure, marriages (often arranged), and oral history of placesand people affected by significant deeds. Often modern people when reading aboutthese cultures misinterpret these philosophies as being form of “ancestor worship”and the long recitations of family lineages which are usually part of these culturesas being ritualized formality. What is often overlooked is that these people, by theiractions, are engaging themselves in the flow of power; to do so is to directly accessthe Flow of the Waters of Life in the Germanic sense of “luck.” These cultures allstrive to maintain or improve their luck in all areas of life.Everythinghas a lineage, but some lineages are simply more significant thanothers. To interact with a powerful lineage is a way to engage power either forevil (unhælo) or good. The gold-hoard of Andvari the Dwarf in Wagner’s famousNiebelungenlied(Saga of the Rheingold) was cursed upon its being stolen. Thatevil lineage was then melded with the lineage of an unsuspecting family when thegold was used by Óðinn, Loki, and Hnir as atonement (wergild) for death of Ottar,a son to Hreiðmar. Often, modern interpreters will attempt to show that the familysomehow “deserved” the curse of Andvari’s gold, but “deserving” really had nothingto do with it. The family interacted with a powerful, evil lineage, volunteering tobe blinded to the gold’s history because the satiation of their greed was foremost intheir minds, and as a result, the family’s lineage became inextricably part of thatcursed, evil line. On the other hand, Beowulf entwined his noble lineage with thatof another, the lineage of the “giantish sword” with which he used to do battle withGrendel’s mother, and as a result, his already great power became even greater sothat he was able to kill the monster which was indestructible by mere human hands.(Notice here how the “giantish sword” provides the power, but a man supplies theaction.) Bauschatz relates that“the extensive description of the sword may seem strange to modernreaders, because very little of it beyond the phraseecgum þyhtig, ‘mightywith blades,’ seems to be of any direct relevance to Beowulf’s problems. Allthis historical, descriptive material is, however, in the Germanic context, ex-tremely relevant. Hrunting, the sword he has tried to use against Grendel’smother and that has failed to bite, is the very best of human swords, butit is not sufficient to the greatness of this task. Beowulf is dealing with thegreater-than-human, and he needs a corresponding weapon; hence, we areexplicitly told of this sword’s origin and history. This greatest of swords willprovide the greatest action in the hands, naturally, of the greatest of men.As a result, the glory of the deed is shared by Beowulf and the sword.”3434Bauschatz, p. 100."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections45In early Germanic culture, wise men sought to interact with powerful and noblelineages which would provide them and theirs with luck and power. Only fools suchas the unfortunate but greedy family of Hreidmar in the Saga of the Rheingold wouldblindly align themselves with a lineage without knowledge of itsørlög. Therefore,the long recitations of lineages of pre-industrial, pre-Christian cultures such as areseen in the well-known “begats” of the Old Testament were never meant to be merelya formality but were of absolute necessity.Tacitus inGermaniaspoke of the importance of omens and divination to theGermanic peoples of 2000 years ago. In the 20th century, we often think of divinationas being either a parlor game or a serious way of glimpsing the future. But tothe Germanic forebears, divination was a way to gain knowledge of the past andits effects on the present. Mark Twain inLife on the Mississippidescribes veryclearly how important it is for the captain of a paddle-wheel steamboat to knowthe conditions of the waters, both on the surface and underneath, for the sakeand safety of the boat and passengers. Measuring the depth of the waters, or“sounding,” was used in close conjunction with visual inspection of the surface tomake determinations on passabilty. The exact same reasoning was used for theexistence of divination among the northern people: testing or “sounding” the pastwith all its connections between events and inspecting the present to determinethe proper course of action to be taken. Divination, then, had little or nothingto do with the future and certainly nothing to do with “predicting” events whichhad not yet come into being. It had only to do with gaining the wisdom oførlög,those conditions which made up the present, so that the seekers of knowledge couldadvantageously place themselves within the flow of power.The early Teutons have often been called a fatalistic group of people who believedthat man’s destiny (future) was rewritten at birth. Snorri tells of this setting of“destiny”:“There stands one beautiful hall under the ash by the well, and out of thishall come three maidens whose names are Weird, Verdandi, Skuld. Thesemaidens shape men’s lives. We call them norns. There are also other nornswho visit everyone when they are born to shape their lives, and these areof divine origin, though others are of the race of elves, and a third groupare of the race of dwarfs, as it says here: ‘Of very diverse parentage I thinkthe norns are, they do not have a common ancestry. Some are descendedfrom Æsir, some are descended from elves, some are the daughters of Dvalin.’Then spoke Gangleri: ’If norns determine the fates of men, they allot terriblyunfairly, when some have a good and prosperous life, and some have littlesuccess or glory, some a long life, some short.’ High said: ’Good norns, ones"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections46of noble parentage, shape good lives, but as for those people that become thevictims of misfortune, it is the evil norns that are responsible’. ”35However, if the concept of the future was, at best, hazy for the ancients, then sowas the idea of predestine. There are quite a large number of folktales where “fate”is cheated and an equally large number where fate is not cheated although goodattempts were made. The point is that, for the ancients, the future was not fixedabsolutely but only tentatively.It’s a fairly common belief that most early peoples believed in a fixed destiny.36Unfortunately, the namesUrð(cognate:“weird”; OEWyrd),Verdandi, andSkuldare often translated in the classical fashion to mean “Past,” “Present,” and “Future.”It is also necessary to consider that not only do modern scholars tend to view theNorns in such a fashion, but that by Snorri’s time Christianity had a solid footholdin the northern countries.“It is also clear, however, from all that has been presented that the Chris-tianization of the pagan Germanic peoples eventually must have created verygreat conceptual problems for them. The temporal reorientation towardthe future, which the Christian conception stresses so strongly, involved a180-degree wrench away from the past toward a future that did not even existprior to Christianization . . . . The term (Wyrd) comes to denote a somewhatambiguous concept in Christian times; sometimes it seems to refer to thewill of God, at others to something like Fortune (and, as such, subservientto God’s will), but it was there forcing itself meaningfully into the speechof those new Christians who struggled to reconcile it somehow with theirrecently acquired Christian orientation and belief.”37Because Christianization occurred prior to the recording of the eddaic and sagaicliterature (since anyone who was capable of writing in the roman script had beentrained by the Church), one needs to be very careful not only in the translation-interpretationbut also in the content of what was actually written. In any case, it is obvious fromthe time of Tacitus down that the early Germanic people held some concept ofdispensers of destiny orørlög, but information is lacking in the northern literatureas to the nature of what was actually dispensed. Until the early part of this century,there was a living tradition among the Norwegian Samí (Laplanders) of the threeGoddesses of childbirth who were known as the Daughters of Madderakka. Their35Snorri, p. 18.36This is another area where people tend to ignore the evidence as it is presented by theanthropologists. Moderns often hold set beliefs and then ”page through history books” looking forthe evidence that they are right. Getting into the habit of reading anthropology texts from frontto back with an open mind is a skill that can be learned and cultivated.37Bauschatz, p. 154."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections47names were Sarakka (saret= “to cleave”; akka = “old woman”), Juksakka (“bow oldwoman”), and Uksakka (“door old woman”), and they correspond to Urð, Verdandi,and Skuld respectively. Sarakka was the guardian of pregnancy, or the splitting ofwoman into two beings, who governed life in the womb. Umo Holmberg provides adescription of a ceremony dedicated to Sarakka:“. . . women in childbed drank ‘Sarakka’s brandy’ before deliverance and,together with other women, ate ‘Sarakka’s porridge’ after giving birth. Inthe porridge three sticks were placed; the first one was cleft and had threerings hanging from it, the second was black, and the third white. These wereall laid for three days at the door of the tent. If it were found that the blackstick had disappeared, it was believed to indicate that the mother or the childwould die. If, on the other hand, the white was lost, both would live.”38(Note: It is interesting that the tradition ofnornagreytr[Norn’s groats] was a customwhich lived on until fairly recently in this century as a birth custom among the FaroeIslanders and that the ceremony was basically the same as described for the Samíabove.) Juksakka warded over the birthing process and, according to tradition, wasable to change a girl-child to a boy immediately prior to birth if the proper sacrificeswere made to her. Her symbol was a small bow, and she would provide a boy childwith the necessary skills to become a good hunter. Uksakka lived under the doorto the tent and received the “newcomer on his arrival in the world, [and], later, shewatched over the first steps of the child to prevent its falling and hurting itself.”39The Samí made sacrifice to her by pouring a drink onto the ground by the doorwhere she dwells.If the names of the Norns,Urð,Verdandi, andSkuld, are translated as Bauschatzsuggests, i.e.“that which has become,” “that which is becoming,” and “obligation,”then the idea of the dispensation of “fate” as was retained by the Samí would runsomething like this:Part of the Flow of the Waters of Life are brought up together as a swirlor eddy out of the Well of Urð (‘that which has become’) and is moved to thesurface (‘that which is becoming’). Once the child is born out of the events38Holmberg, UmoFinno-Ugric Mythology,published as vol. 4 ofMythology of All Racesedited by J. A. MacCulloch (Boston MA) 1928, pp. 253-54. This book contains much materialpertaining to the cultures neighboring the Germanic realm immediately to the north and to theeast. Holmberg also has many discussions about the speculation of ”borrowings” between theScandinavians and the Finno-Ugric tribes. Holmberg’s material is also used in many of the chaptersthat follow and it was this work primarily which encouraged the author to look closely at theborder-zone culture as being a way to fill in gaps, particularly by what the Scandinavians chose to”borrow” presumedly to fill in gaps that they themselves perceived.39Holmberg, p. 254."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections48which have already occurred and is brought into the present time frame, itslineage (ørlögor ‘obligation’) is affixed.There is no need then to think in terms of destiny (future) when what is actuallybeing given to the child is its present complete with its heritage, and all obligations,debts, and deeds accomplished which occurred prior to the present. Such a view ofbirth may seem grim to modern readers. People of the 20th century like to thinkthat children are born with a “blank slate” (tabla rasa) which is a pleasant ideaexcept that science now says that, from a genetic standpoint, children are born withcertain physical and neurological characteristics with which each is destined to live.Research into such areas as addictive personalities, psychological traits, physicaltraits (such as muscularity or obesity), and socio-economic status has shown thatchildren are born with package and parcel which comes from the lineage of theirforebears. Grim or not, the idea that children are born with the debts and obligationsof their immediate ancestry is viable in this day and age.The concept of heritage at birth, which was apparently affixed at the namingceremony, is really little more than the idea that each individual has his own startingpoint provided at birth. From that point on, the future is undetermined and eachis free to do with his life as he will within the constraints of heritage. However,it has been shown that past actions determine the make-up of the present, and itmay well be that two lineages, prior to a child’s birth, are on a collision course withone another improving the probability that certain events will occur in the future.Knowledge oførlögbecomes vital then for gaining access to luck/ power. Sincenothing is really predestined, those things that have already been put into motioncan be modified so that all eventually can benefit, but proper changes can only bemade by acting knowledgeably; acting without knowledge is a fool’s game.ørlögisonly fixed up to the present so that one can interact with other lineages and canthereby gain access to power which ultimately can result in changing what was oncea dull, miserable starting point into a rich and prosperous life.With the Germanic concept of time and space laid out, the next obvious questionsshould be, “Is such an ancient philosophy applicable in this day and age, and if so,what changes would the application of such a philosophy bring about?”The answer to the first part of the question is always going to depend uponpersonal experience. The “ancientness” of the philosophy makes no difference; theimportant issues are whether it works and whether one’s current philosophy is a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections49success or a failure, i.e. a functional worldview. In the 20thcentury, there areseveral problems which recur in the therapy rooms of counselors, psychologists,and psychiatrists: feelings of isolation or alienation, depression, addictions, feelingsof powerlessness or victimization, low self-esteem and a variety of psycho-somaticillnesses. Some seek out help from conventional medicine while others try to improvetheir spiritual side by connecting with all different kinds of cults, sects, organizedchurches or alternative medical practices such as homeopathy, shamanic counseling,crystal healing, etc. The bottom line is that many would like to know how they fitinto the world as it stands today, and a good spiritual philosophy should be able todefine that role.The ancient Germanic spiritual philosophy is applicable today in that it matcheswell with the current knowledge base of the scientific and, in particular, the medicalcommunities, but, more importantly, by shifting modern man’s point of view frommaterial things more toward the relationships between events, people, places, etc.,one is free to find one’s role in the overall functioning of the world in a realisticfashion, free to relate to the world in such a way that all can benefit. The spiritualexplorer will find that after applying this weltanschauung, the role of any singleindividual appears relatively small and usually fairly insignificant within the scopeof the entire picture, but also with this same realization comes a sense of belonging.An incredible sense of freedom begins to develop out of the idea that the futureis still unwritten. At every turn of the present, one is granted a series of choices,choices which will place him in the mainstream of life if he so chooses. Choosingto look at the currents (relationships) flowing through the world rather than at themyriad material things reminds people that they are never truly isolated;40the veryexistence of any single person is, in essence,entirely dependent on the number andquality of relationships that the individual has to the rest of the world; pathologicalego-centrism, which is the taproot of all the psychological problems listed above, isnot a part of this philosophy although self-enjoyment and love of life are certainlygood possible outcomes. Always, though, the answer to the first question is personaland individualized.Many changes can be brought about by the mere acceptance of this ancientphilosophy, but there are many changes necessary in the way a person lives beforebenefits can be won. Individualism, for example, is a trait commonly ascribed tothe ancient Germanic peoples of the Viking Era (roughly 700 - 1000 CE) and even40Through this book the imagery of water, the flowing of water, movements of water areprevalent. This is not an error. I have chosen to avoid the traditional interpretation of ”fate asthe universal weaving” mainly because I find it a tired metaphor, but also because the ancientNorse (and the early Indo-European culture in general) placed the imagery of water into theircosmologies. I personally find the concept of water much easier to work with and much moreprevalent in eddaic/ sagaic literature and in later folk lore as well."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections50earlier, but the ancient interpretation of the concept was somewhat different thanthat which has developed in the latter half of the 20thcentury. Back then, peopleunderstood that a person was only an individual in that he or she brought specialpersonal talents into the overall functioning of the community. Talents or skills weredeveloped by the individual but were “gifted” to the totality of the community inwhich one lived. A Viking warrior’s skills were added to the collective skills of thecrew because only by finely-worked team effort were battles won with a minimumloss of life. A woman’s skills in the household or in the fields were added to those ofthe family unit or to those of the community. Individualism, then, had more to dowith one’s individualized function/ role within a community, country, or world thanwith acting “individually,” contrary to or in spite of current trends. This philosophyalso brings with it responsibility to family, friends or community and responsibilityfor one’s actions and ensuing consequences. By choosing to look at relationshipsbetween things instead of simplyatindividual things, one quickly begins to realizethat no act is ever committed in complete isolation, and that each act initiates a setripples in the large pond (reverberating effects) with the greatest effects being feltclosest to the act’s point of origin. To use an exaggerated example, if a woman slaysher husband, the effects are felt greatest in the families of both parties, slightly lessso in the community (depending on the size and the ’tightness’ of the community),and at the national level, the actisreported but generally merits but one or twosmall paragraphs on the some back page of USA Today (if even that). However, if asenator commits the same act, because of the number and quality of his relationshipsthroughout the nation, i.e., the quality or power of individualørlag(pl. form) hehas interacted with, the effect felt is greater.In this worldview, responsibility is a burden that only human beings bear, and itcomes in two distinct varieties: responsibilitytofamily, community, and ultimatelyto the entire Tree/ Waters complex, and responsibilityforone’s own actions. Inthe Germanic system this is so because only people are capable of committing phys-ical acts which result in new layers being put down in the Well of Urð affectingthe Flow of the Waters/ power/ luck through the whole Tree. The wise person,according to this ancient spiritual philosophy, chooses to interact with strong, com-patible lineages, such as Beowulf’s interaction with the “giantish sword’s lineage,”strengthening the individual line, but also better to gain access to the flow of power/luck for the individual himself. By accepting this challenge of responsibility and byacting in an honorable manner, one is assured of at least maintaining one’s standingin life in the community if not ultimately improving it. To act out of ignorance,voluntarily or otherwise, one is dooming himself and his lineage to loss of power/luck. Germanic sagaic literature is filled with such stories. Responsibility meansacting out of wisdom."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections51The spiritual road begins with accepting one’sstarting pointin the world. A childis born from a family tree, a bloodline, complete with debts and payments. Some ofthese take the form of genetic inheritances, some of socio-economic status, and othersare simply learned over the course of growing up. People inherit psycho-emotionaltendencies with all the strengths and weaknesses passed down through familial aswell as community lineages. Some babies are born from blue-collar lines and somefrom white. Whatever the case may be, all have a starting point inherited at birth,and none, absolutely none, are born as a “blank slate.” Each member of the existingfamily will slight differences in inheritance because of being born at different times,but all access the same lineage for luck or power.The great American dream (myth?) is that all sons have the same chance forpresidency, but this is little more than a dream and has nothing to do with reality.There is a current trend among young people (the trend actually has a long history)to turn their backs on their own personal history. Some refuse to admit, evento themselves, that they come from a long line of blue-collar workers, or perhapsfrom a lineage rife with alcoholics, thieves, prostitutes, con men or drug addicts.Some come from families with members who suffer from mental illnesses, or wheredomestic violence is a part of everyday life. Certain familial weaknesses are oftenembarrassing to individuals (although, oddly enough, an “addiction craze” has beenrather faddish for the past decade in spite of the fact that ‘addictions’ previouslywere thought of as the result of weakness). In any case, there are many who cannotaccept their own lineage for whatever the reason, and these spend a lifetime runningand hiding from their past.On the other hand, there are those who, while still not accepting their past,choose to fight against their lineage and their starting points in life. For the pasttwo decades or so, the fashion has been for “lineage-haters” to write books or appearon talk shows so that they can publicly denounce their past. But these are nodifferent in essence than those who turn their backs on their family lineage and hidetheir starting points in life behind glittery false fronts; they still are unable to accepttheir own origins and their ownørlög.The eddaic lay (’song’), theRigsthula(’the Song of Rig’), describes the startingpoints of people; in the pre-Viking era not all folk were created equally. The generalinterpretation of the “ Song of Rig” is that the White God, Heimdallr, at one timetraveled through Midgard. During his travels, He met up with Ai and Edda (GreatGrandfather and Great Grandmother), worker of the earth, and stayed with themthree nights. It was during this stay that a son, Thrall, was engendered. Eventually,Thrall married Thir-the-Drudge, and they, in turn, began the race of thralls (workersof the earth; slaves) having ten sons and nine daughters, all of whom had names suchas Stinking, Dumpy, Oak-Thighs, Shouter, and Horse-Fly. Heimdallr continued his"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections52journey and met up with Afi and Amma (Grandfather and Grandmother) with thesame results except that they became the original parents of the race of peasants(free men under a ruler or king). After a time, he met up with Faðir and Moðir(Father and Mother) who engendered the social class of free men and royalty.A common Ásatrú interpretation of this lay is to help explain and rationalize theexistence of royalty; however, taken at face value the lay says only that people arenot born equally, that they do not have the same lots in life. A popular trend in the20thcentury as a way to avoid one’s starting point in life is to accept reincarnationand to look into the “karmic” past or the “akashic records” for some sign of royaltyor heroic personages to compensate for what is conceived to be poor a startingpoint. This trend often involves selectively searching familial history to find royaltyor another aesthetically pleasing personality, and once such a personage can beclaimed, rightfully or not, he or she becomes the material for serious “name-dropping.Most of us can find something good in our personal lineages, I suppose, but we finda lot more that is unacceptable to our overly sensitive 21stcentury tastes. Thetendency is to consciously and conveniently “forget” the disagreeable characters withthe polly-annic attitude of “Out of sight, out of mind,” (therefore, “out of reality”)but this is a game only to fool ourselves. Accepting one’s starting point as it is notalways easy or comfortable, but at some point, itisnecessary.There are and most likely will always be some people who either accept theirstarting points in life and have adequate access to power/ luck or who do not acceptit and seem to enjoy adequate access anyway. They seem to be settled in theirways and do not have any real problems in maintaining their status quo. This canbe somewhat disconcerting to some. However, simply by being born into Midgard,each has a connection to the Flow of the Waters of Life regardless of whether aperson believes it or not; belief is not an issue here, a workable worldview is. Someof these folks live out their lives completely unconcerned about ancestry yet alwayscontinuing to access power/ luck from their familial lines. This is often the casewith many children who are adopted. Adoption also usually allows a child to beginlife with strong interactions with another lineage adding to the power/ luck theirfamily histories. They begin life with complex starting points. There are otherswho have, for whatever reason chosen to turn their backs on their heritage and seemto continue accessing power/ luck by acquiring and maintaining close ties to otherlineages. As long as these maintain those ties by living their lives in such a mannerthat they remain in good standing with the communities of Læraþ, the World Tree,and they continue to live well. Other people simply go along through life until theirpower/ luck runs out, then a change in the way of life becomes necessary.An individual starting point is the opening through which one’s lineage/ luckcan be tracked back to the source of the Waters. If one turns his back on his"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections53own lineage, he may be denying himself access to that source of power/ luck. Butmore crucially, since, in this worldview, people are born with bothpaymentsanddebtsof the family line, accepting one’s starting point also has much to do with theknowledge of personalørlög. The debts which were already settled prior to one’sbirth give access to power/ luck making the journey from birth to death comfortableand significant for the individual. Without luck, life is little more than a series ofwishes or daydreams. Unpaid debts and obligations, however, are very importantthough mainly because they can and often do drain away power/ luck from theindividual often resulting in the development of psychological or physical problemsas described above.Ralph Metzner, a successful clinical psychologist, ran into some of these problemsin his own life. He had spent years trying to find hisplace in the Treeby studyingeastern religions and philosophies such as Zen, meditation, experimentation withmind-altering drugs, etc., while at the same time he was turning his back on a“shameful,” unwanted past.“For some years, I have been gradually coming to a deeper realization ofthe importance of connecting with one’s ancestors. My own inner work andthe experiences of my students and my clients in psycho-therapy have longconvinced me that, while the origins of many disturbances can be found inpatterns of relationship with one’s parents (who are, after all, our ancestorstoo), one often needs to go beyond biographical factors to prenatal and peri-natal conditions, to multigenerational family patterns, and to ethnic, cultural,racial, or national influences \\dots. A few independent minded psychologistsand psychiatrists have occasionally ventured to suggest the existence of anancestral complex, or something like a family curse, that could be affectingthe inner psychic life of individuals and, hence, their relationships and generalattitude toward life.”41Metzner spent many years coming to grips with his ancestry both in understandingthe need to do so and in the acceptance of his own starting point, hisørlög. Theresult of this decades-long search is the book cited above, which, although containingsome historically inaccurate information regarding Germanic spirituality as it wasapparently practiced by the early Teutons, is an excellent internal view of a man’sthought processes while in search of his individual source of power/ luck, and itremains as a record of a man’s personal experience with the Gods and philosophiesof his ancestors.41Metzner, RalphThe Well of Rememberance: Rediscovering the Earth Wisdom Myths ofNorthern Europe(Shambhala; Boston) 1994, p. 5."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections54The spiritual philosophy of the early Germanic peoples, unlike that of Chris-tianity, was not a route to salvation since they did not believe that anything to besaved from. One starts out in life as part of a family lineage and remains part of hislineage. The worldview and its proscription for action and responsibility was a wayto access the power/ luck flowing with the Waters that fed the World Tree and a wayfor an individual to participate in the overall functioning of the Universe bringingmeaning and value into a life well-lived. Our primary concern today is generallyfor personal comfort through life, but for the ancients, the ultimate desire was tofit comfortably into the scheme of things which, of course, brought with it a senseof personal comfort and well-being. Really, once one realizes that no individual lifeis separate from any other, the main desires in life, i.e. to be the best that anyone can be, to live life to its fullest potential, and to go to the grave as a completehuman being, are the same no matter the century or the place. Only the process ofachieving these ends is different.Common 20thcentury philosophy is something like “I must learn to love myselfbefore I can love, care for and nurture others.” A quaint philosophy and rathercommonly heard, but it is very ego-centric (almost pathologically so) and typicalto this century. People alreadydo love themselves above all othersoften to thepoint that they sometimes forget thatotherseven exist (on freeways in the USA,in grocery store lines, at garage sales, etc.) and in their forgetfulness, they takethe lives and conditions around them for granted sometimes actually causing greatharm and destruction while engaging in their personal use of the world aroundthem. Self-gratification has been the rule for ages. In fact, it was the very thingthat brought the Roman Empire to ruin. Folks sate their desires for money, comfort,love, material goods, possessions, land and power without thought or concern forthe effects that greed is wreaking. They search for royalty in their pasts to satisfyand pacify egos that have grown great at the expense of everything around them,but, in reality, these modern folks are the inheritors of Andvari’s gold. It is not thatwe do not “love ourselves” but that there is no value to our lives.For the ancients, the spiritual goals of the 20thcentury would seem crude atbest, for they believed in leading a life that was “worth” (from the same IE root asUrð;Wyrd) something, and that interacting with the Waters of Life was the meansto a life of “worth.” TheHávamálor the ”Sayings of the High One” (one of thepoems in the Elder or Poetic Edda) is often viewed as the Viking Code of Conductas Lee Hollander’s introduction to her translation of it would indicate:“They (the poetic verses) stress especially the laws of hospitality, therules of decent conduct, the value of circumspection in one’s dealings withmen, the need for moderation in eating and drinking, the vanity of merewealth compared with true merit–all in the spirit of Germanic Heathendom,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Connections55with many a pearl of shrewd wisdom, of terse humor, of noble sentiment.We single out for admiration the deeply moving stanzas on having a home ofone’s own, however humble (Sts. 36-37), and those magnificently asseveratingthe lastingness, in a world subject to the law of change, of a fair name (Sts.77-78).”42The poem, however, is far more than a simple list of suggestions. When one readsthe poem in terms of interacting with the Flow of the Waters of Life, a differentpicture of early Germanic ”morality” begins to emerge.The only things gained by participating in life for these ancient Scandinavianswas ”worth” and a “fair name.” “Worth” went with the individual into the Land ofthe Ancestors, and the only thing left behind on Midgard after death was a startingpoint for descendants, good or bad depending on the individual’s choices in life.“Cattle die and kinsmen die,thyself eke soon wilt die;but fair fame will fade neverI ween, for him who wins it.Cattle die kinsmen die,thyself eke soon wilt die;one thing, I wot wilt wither never;the “doom” over each one dead.”Hávamál” Sts. 76-77, Hollander, tr.)The “doom over each one dead” is the individualørlög, the swirls and eddys left onthe surface of the Waters in the Well of Urð and the layers directly below, after onehas left Midgard. These layers become part of the starting point for the followinggenerations. By interacting knowledgeably with the flow of luck seething up fromthe original source, a person is able to leave a “fair layer” in the Well of Urð for thosecoming up later to act upon, and, in this way, then, one has led a life of worth.The “Sayings of the High One” is much more than a testament of Teutonicmorality; it is a manual for interacting with power/ luck in a fashion which willbenefit all who come later. The 165 stanzas of the poem stress acting with knowledgeand how to act so that knowledge does not pass one by. As Hollander mentioned inher introduction, there are many stanzas which deal with moderation, a sentimentnot commonly associated with the Viking era, because without moderation one is42Hollander, LeeThe Poetic Edda(University of Texas Press; Austin TX) 1962, p. 14."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

Greed, self-pity,depression, jealousy, envy, hate, and hunger all place blinders over the eyes so thatone becomes incapable of acting knowledgeably. In theHávamálstress is placedon taking care of oneself so that life is not just a series of “re-actions” but is rathera string of “actions” based on the knowledge of the past. And, indeed, the pastisstressed:“The unwise man waketh all night,thinking of this and that–tosses, sleepless and is tired at morn:nor lighter for that his load”(St. 23, Hollander, tr.).The poem guides one through a life where the future is yet unwritten and uncertain.The bulk of the poem implores one to interact with others cautiously. To interactwith anørlögwhich stems from a good lineage increases one’s own access to power/luck but a poor lineage decreases it and should be avoided, therefore, at all costs:“For from an evil man not ever wilt thoureward for good;a goodman, though will gain for theethe love and liking of many”(St. 123, Hollander, tr.).“With his friend a man should be friends everand pay back gift for gift;(the enemy’s scornful laughter he learn to repay,and eke give lies for lies)”(St. 42, Hollander, tr., [reformatted using the footnotes notes]).Stanzas 112-137 are all prefaced with “Hear thou, Loddfafnir, and heed it well, learnit, ’twill lend thee strength, follow it, ’twill further thee” which is often considered tobe just a formulaic device, but the “strength” which is lent is most likely that which isacquired from knowledgeable interaction, i.e., that which is gained from the Watersof Life. To imply that this is simply a formulaic phrase is a severe understatement.The value of the entire poem is that by using it as a set of guidelines one is lead"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

The wake left behind upon one’s death issuch a powerful one that all those coming after will benefit.The value, then, of resurrecting and practicing the spiritual philosophy of theancient Germanic peoples, even in the 20stcentury, is to generate a life of value,honor, and worth. By interacting with the Flow of the Waters of Life , one findshis individual place in the overall scheme of things. That which is left behind isnot just a meaningless stack of material goods, but a powerful gateway throughwhich descendants can gain access to the same power/ luck that pervades the entireUniverse. The spirituality of these people stands in direct contrast to the selfish,materialistic philosophies which are rampant in the world of the late 20th century,and acceptance of this ancient path requires for many a shift in focus of 180◦.

An extremely distant worldview, for example, such as viewing the earth uponwhich we live as a giant sea-cucumber would do little more than draw laughter,concern, or fear from the “non-believing faction.” Secondly, it should be functionalso that it can be used as the basis upon which fairly accurate predictions anddecisions can be made. Such decisions allow us to interact with the planet in away that both the individual and the planet itself benefit. The capability to “blowthe planet up three times over” has existed now since World War II, but to doso would serve no end. To be sure, there are groups of people who would loveto eliminate certain other groups of people, but to accomplish this by destroyingthe planet is the very epitome of non-functionality, akin to “cutting off the headto spite the nose!” Thirdly, a worldview should satisfy one’s set of aesthetics. Bysubscribing to a particular worldview, one should see the world with a sense of aweor wonder. Granted not everyone is going to see the world as a beautiful place;many seem to enjoy having something to complain about. Having something tocomplain about is in reality aesthetically pleasing to ‘complainers. They receive asense of enjoyment and fulfillment by discovering a “new thing wrong in the world”Finding something aesthetically pleasing then does not necessarily mean that onefinds beauty; finding something aesthetically pleasing means that one’s needs aresated with interpretations of the world which might include beauty, but also perhapswonder, or maybe just some new material to ponder.The first of the three general worldviews is common to many different Christiancommunities as well as to much of the scientific community: the earth is a sterile“rock” which functions as non-living matrix within which a system of ecospheresare located. An ecosphere, more realistically a biome, is a region of interdependentspecies of life which function together as a unit, for example, a swamp or a mountain,and includes all forms of life in that region from one-celled organisms all the wayup to the most complex forms (including the self-aware form, man). This theoryallows its followers to extract materially as much as possibly can be gotten from the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard60ecosphere within which they live without having to deal with feelings of compassion,sadness, or gratitude. This group is ruthless, i.e., devoid of any feelings in itsinteractions with the earth. (Note that “ruthless” here is not used in its negativesense but in a completely neutral sense.) This particular group has been responsiblefor much of the scientific advancement enjoyed by people living during the latterhalf of the 20th century including better nutrition, medicine/ surgery, improvedcommunication/ information systems, etc. Although much good has come out ofthis faction of mankind, not all discoveries have been good. The group with its lackof compassion for the environment has been responsible for many of the ecologicalcrises of the age, and as a result, many individuals are currently in search of aworldview which will prove to be less damaging to the environment and whichwill result in fewer feelings of guilt or shame for the individual. Remember theValdez/ Hazelwood incident in Alaska? DDT? Asbestos? Thorazine, thalidomide,and the first polio vaccines which resulted in psychoses, birth defects and comas,respectively? Chemical fertilizer? CFC’s? Our modern interaction with the earthhas also shown similar damaging results.Many from the scientific community are beginning to shift their views slightly.The scientific theory called the “systems theory” states basically that individualcomponents do not exist independent of one another but belong instead to a systemor a matrix and that the relationships between the components are just as importantas the components themselves. A human body, for example, is made up of billionsof individual cells and can be even further subdivided into molecules and furtherinto atoms, but to study the human body, one must take into consideration how allthese parts interact with one another. The second way of looking at earth, then, isas a single organism which expresses itself as billions of life forms.People who buy into this theory subscribe, generally, to the Gaia Matrix The-ory as first outlined and explored by James Lovelock or belong to one of the manyso-called “Earth-Religions” which are really branches of the pervasive New Age move-ment. Actually, it is not uncommon to find folk who accept both these worldviewsby blending them together. These folk, as opposed to the first group, do not actin a ruthless manner, but out of compassion, concern, and even love. They see theearth as a single “living” system where any manipulation of individual parts resultsin changes throughout the entire system. Many of the 20th century advances inecology, holistic medicine, anthropology, psychology, etc. are a direct result of thisage-old way of viewing the earth upon which we live. This view of the planet asthe “Earth Mother” has been around for possibly 10-20 millennia and seems to gothrough periods of renewal occasionally. The number of 21st century adherents tothis group appears to be growing quickly.The third theory states that the earth itself is part of an even larger system. Some"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard61from the scientific community are beginning to move in this direction although atthis point in time the second group seems to contain the largest numbers. Thisgroup holds that the universe itself (or possibly even a system of “universes”) isa single system or organism and, as in the second group, any change made in anindividual part of the system will affect the entire system. The 60 year old theoryof quantum mechanics is partially the result of the efforts of this group, as well assome of the newer ideas such as “chaos theory” both of which are far beyond thescope of this author.In the case of the ancient Germanic people, Earth is an integral part of a tripartiteconcept known to them as Yggdrasil, Lærað, Mímameið, or, in modern terms, theWorld Tree. In this ancient view, the entire universe is represented by the livingWorld Tree and contains all that there is and all that there can be. In modernGermanic languages, the normal word for the universe isdas(or other appropriatearticle)All,literally translated as “the everything.” In Chapter 1, the connectionsor the relationships between the individual parts were discussed. For the ancientsthese relationships are represented by the Flow of the Waters of Life with the word“Life” being that of the entire organism of the World Tree. For these folk, then,Dasgesamte All lebt,“The entire universe is alive!”Among these groups of people, for the most part, there are a large percentage ofpeople who are concerned about the welfare of the planet. The “sterile-rock” group’sconcern is purely selfish, however. The Christian faction believes that the earth ishere for man’s use, i.e., to be exploited: “All things in God’s Creation are here for theservice of Man.” This group is becoming concerned, however, that over-exploitationwithout control will eventually shorten man’s stay on the planet. With knowledgeof the effects of pollution, and the over-harvesting of non-renewable resources, mancan either poison himself into extinction or will run out of non-renewable resources(mainly fossil fuels) so that the planet becomes uninhabitable for anything exceptpossibly cockroaches, coyotes, and a large number of bacteria and virii. Many inthis group justify their use of the planet by stating that it is the Will of God andthat, since their stay on this planet is temporary, the extinction of a few speciesmatters little or is according to God’s Plan.The part of the scientific community that subscribes to the sterile-rock theory isoften very willing to explore alternative forms of energy in a unbridled fashion and isalso willing to move ahead with such experimentation to better the living conditionsof man. Many if not most of these scientists are careful not to “over harvest” anyone particular thing because they realize that there must be a balance, but, if aspecies of life happens to fall into extinction as a result of “forward motion,” so beit, as long as man benefits. This constant push forward resulted in the accidents atChernobyl and Three-mile Island, however."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard62The second group, the “Earth-Religion Group,” is much more cautious in itsapproach to research. These people are concerned about inter-relationships betweenbiomes and want to know what effect any experimentation is going to have at a locallevel as well as the regional, hemispheric, and global levels. Regardless of whetherany individual in this group believes that the Earth is a sentient being or not, heor she has a “feel” for the idea that any single change does not occur in isolation,but that one change results in everything being changed to some degree. Thesefolks often scream loudly at congressional hearings that an environmental impactstatement is either needed or is incomplete, that animals are in need of protectionfrom man, or that unchecked nuclear testing on the environment is a threat to alllife. This group has done much to improve not only the living conditions of manbut those of all organisms. In general, this group has done more than any otherfirst because it is very active at the national level, and secondly because it is alreadylarge and growing in numbers every day.The third group is almost completely unknown except in the so-called “backwardsThird World countries” where shamanistic or animistic practices are still prevalent,yet this is the group which will be dealt with most specifically in this chapter.The central idea is that man does not live on earth but on Middle-earth (MiddleWorld in the terms of neo-shamanism; Midgard in ON) which is situated between anUpperworld and a Lowerworld. This Middleworld or Midgard does not nor can notexist in isolation but is dependent upon the Upper- and Lowerworlds for sustenance.In more modern terms, it could be said that “earth” is but part of a greater whole.A modern, scientific analogy is that this world that we call the Earth belongs locallyto the solar system, regionally to the Milky Way galaxy on a broader scale, and tothe Universe on the broadest of scales. Additionally, there is no single point where“earth” stops and the rest of the solar system begins. Elementary particles, photons,neutrinos, and electrons, travel from the sun to the earth which in turn interacts withmoon and neighboring planets gravitationally; comets and asteroids travel about ona larger scale. The Hubble telescope has revealed to us that the solar system is but aminuscule archipelago of planets and planetoids floating in galaxy-sized seas of gas.This is accepted by most of the scientific community regardless of the group theybelong to. Not only is Earth part of a largerwholebut its edges are continuous withthe larger whole as well. In fact, everything that is acknowledged by the secondgroup is also acknowledged by this third group but the idea that effects, results,repercussions and reverberations are not only felt upon the planet but throughoutthe entire Universe to some degree at least. Even though these scientists usuallyaccept quantum physics and chaos theory viable models for explaining the workingsof the universe, they still have a difficult time moving from the idea that the universea “sterile thing” to the idea that it is “alive.”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard63In the tripartite system of the ancient Teutons, all parts are interdependent; i.e.,one part is always dependent on the other two. In ON this Universe was known asYggdrasil, Lærað, or Mimameið, and in more modern anthropological literature, asthe World Tree. The other, more common, way of looking at the ancient Germanicphilosophy of theAllis to say that “Yggdrasil” is how the World Tree was called bythe Gods, “Lærað” by men, and “Mimameið” by the giants.1Modern researchers suspect that the early Germanic people probably held deeprespect for Midgard and this probability will be discussed at length below; however,to say that the ancients followed an “Earth-Religion” as is described in much ofthe New Age literature is an oversimplification and is probably incorrect. Earth ispersonified in the eddaic and sagaic literature asJörd, Mother of Þór and one-timemate of Óðínn, and sometimes asRindorFjörgyn(speculative), but worship of thisgoddess/ giantess, although speculated through archeological finds, cultural anthro-pological studies, etc. as being a probability, is completely unrecorded so to labelthis ancient philosophy an Earth Religion is probably over-extension and perhapslittle more than wishful thinking among members of the New Age community. Sheis primarily known as the Mother of Þór and appears in kennings (poetic metaphors)as an adjective to describe objects or people. Snorri does say, however, that “Þór’smother Jörd and Vali’s mother Rind are reckoned among the Asynjur.”2AlthoughEarth does not appear to have been worshipped as an entity in the Germanic pan-theon, there are recordings of many public and private events which deal specificallywith fecundity, particularly in agricultural regions. The cults of the Vanir or Nerthuswould be an example of this (discussed later), but their ceremonial purpose may havehad more to do with the fertility of the earth through proper care than with beinga true “Earth-Religion” as defined by modern neo-pagans.The early Germanic peoples lived together in small communities usually com-prised of a few extended families living near one another. At the time of the VikingAge (usually thought to start at around 750 CE3), it was not uncommon to findsome communities allying themselves with others to form small regional kingdomssimilar to the concept of “counties” in the USA, and these were either lead by aking and his retinue or by a council4. Prior to their congregating in cities, northern1SeeSnorri’s Eddatranslated by Anthony Faulkes (Penguin Books, 1995) for a discussion ofkennings, a type of metaphor utilized by Heathen and Christian Germanic poets (called”skalds”)and specialized classical northern Germanic vocabulary such as these names for the World Tree.2InEddatranslated by Anthony Faulkes and published by Everyman’s Library (London) in1987, p. 31.3There has been and will continue to be serious debates as to the actual starting point of theso-called Viking Age. Such a discussion here is completely useless to our purpose; therefore, thestarting point is kept at roughly 750 CE which is little more than a midpoint between 500 CE and1000 CE.4Victor Mosby in hisHistory of the Swedish Peoplediscusses how these small community"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard64Europeans led a life which was closely bound to Earth and her moods. Up to theViking Age, the ancient Scandinavians depended almost entirely upon the Earth asa source of income. According to archeological evidence, the Swedes who occupiedSweden early on, from about 5000 - 3000 BCE, were hunters and gatherers, from3000 BCE to 0 CE, herded small livestock orsmale, and from 0 CE to the last cen-tury, were engaged in family farming operations. Additionally, they hunted gamein the wilderness, fished the lakes, streams, and fjords (in Norway), and foraged theforests for wild foods. In fact, until the industrial revolution most families entireincome came from farming, fishing or mining, and it was this close tie to the landthat shaped much of Germanic culture as it is known today.In the 20th century, vestiges of our agrarian way of life often go unnoticed. Forexample, the modern American “school year” was originally set up so that youngpeople would go to school when they were least needed around the farm. Thepayment of income tax comes when the last of livestock are sold off (most rancheswill not start selling this year’s calves until June). For the most part, these “customs”left over from farming days long gone are no longer meaningful since income foralmost 90% of American families comes from business and industry rather fromlaboring in nature. Lacking any firm ties to the cycles of nature or to the earth, itis no wonder that the “sterile-rock” group got such a strong foothold in this countrybetween 1920 and 1970.Up and into the last century, all aspects of folk life from birth to death, includingart, music, and spirituality, were shaped by the forces of nature and the changingof seasons. Secular festivals related primarily to planting and harvesting or animalhusbandry. The modern Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter were originallyHeathen holidays. Christmas was called Yule orJólwhich according to Snorriin theHeimskringlawas a holiday to celebrate the fertility of the fields for thecoming year but it also came during a period of leisure time at the tail end of thebutchering season and was closely tied to the disappearance and reappearance ofthe sun at the Arctic Circle during the winter solstice. Easter is allegedly namedafter an unknown Goddess or giantess tied to the return of spring to the land andwas known in the ancient north as “summernights.”5Both holidays, now under thesway of the Church, retain trappings and ritualized customs related to their earlierform as fertility festivals with but a thin veneer of Christianity. Baptisms, weddings,councils (which he calls aby) functioned. This type of government also became the standard forIceland with regional differences, of course. Both kingdoms and councils are also alluded to byTactitus in hisGermania.Both systems of government apparently have long histories and wereknown to work comfortably beside one another.5SeeHeimskringla: Saga of the Norse Kings,translated by Samuel Laing (Everyman’sLibrary #847, London), 1961, p. 13 and p. 49.

Midgard65and in some places of the north, even funerals were held off until spring when iceand snow had cleared enough so that traveling priests could perform the ceremonies.The North is a land of extremes in terms of the weather and the soil, so, really, it isinevitable that nature shaped and continues to maintain the shape of the northernfolk life.It was stated above that the early Germanic people did not generally practicean “Earth-Religion” as it is commonly defined today in that they did not worshipthe “Mother Earth” as a specific deity. On the other hand, the ancient Teutons didworship several deities who were closely involved in caring for the fertility of theland, specifically, the Vanir, Nerthus (a Goddess who is often viewed by moderninterpreters as the Earth personified). Temples were known, at least at the timeof the Viking Age, but the names usually utilized in Old Norse to mean “temple”had to do primarily with ”sacred land.” In general, these were groves, hills, mounds,and in other cases, mountains, waterfalls and springs. There are many place-namesthroughout the entire north ending in-lund(grove),-Vé(consecrated land),-hörg(harrow or altar). Tacitus, the Roman historian, stated that Germans“did not confine their gods within walls, and did not make images of them,but rather consecrated forests and groves, calling by the names of gods thathidden power which they beheld only with reverence of their own eyes. . .. These passages show that, among the Germans, the belief in personal butunseen gods was highly developed, and that worship was often conducted inthe open air, without buildings or idols. Later sources also show that open-airworship was widespread.”6Worship, religion, and spirituality, for the ancients were continuous with the landaround them, and they apparently found no real need to separate them until thecoming of Christianity when the folk were finally forced under penalty of bothChurch and secular law to cease the practice of leaving sacrifices for their Heathendeities, land- and water-spirits, and ancestors in these sacred places.Since folk-customs often die a very slow death, the Church even found it neces-sary to sanctify many of these sacred plots to one saint or another and build churchesor shrines either next to the original spot or immediately on top of them.“When Christianity was imposed, the most important Pagan sacred siteswere occupied and churches built upon them. TheVéat Jellinge, Denmark,is a prime example. Similarly, At Gamla Uppsala in Sweden, a great woodentemple existed until around 1100. It is thought that this site originated as a6InMyth and Religion of the Northby G. Turville-Petre, p. 175."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard66sacred grove, then evolved into aHörgrand then a temple. A cathedral wasbuilt upon the temple site.”7Pennick and Jones also present several cases where Christian holy places were dese-crated by the Heathen hoards such as “the action of Ota in Dublin” or “Peel Cathe-dral on the Isle of Man”, but he feels that this “might equally have been part of thereverent tradition of continuity.”8Their conclusion seems most reasonable in viewof the Germanic people’s spiritual philosophy of needing to interact with people,places, and objects of power/ luck.What the church leaders failed to understand is that for the northern peopleslandhas lineage; it has its own ̧orlög independent of the people living on it. A holyspot is ”holy” because that is its “fate,” and people gather there because itisholy,plain and simple. Family land is family land because the destinies of both landand family are intertwined, and people are drawn to these areas naturally becausepower/ luck pours up from the Original Spring through the underworld out onto thesurface of the land. Early on, the Church greatly disapproved of such activities asthis Canon enacted during the reign of King Edmund (959-975 CE) clearly reveals:“16. And we enjoin, that every priest zealously promote Christianity, andtotally extinguish every Heathenism; and forbid well-worshipping, and spir-itualism, and divinations, and enchantments, and idol-worshipping, and thevain practices which are carried on with various spells, and with peace-enclosures,and with elders, and also with various other trees, and with stones, and withmany various delusions, with which men do much of what they should not.”9Over the centuries, though, the Church has not needed to be quite as harsh as inthe early stages of conversion since it sanctified and rebuilt many of these holy spotsin the names of its saints which was, in the long run, much easier than trying toprevent the folk making periodic pilgrimages and leaving offerings. In general, theseholy places are often still maintained and protected by the local churches.7In Nigel Pennick’s and Prudence Jones’A History of Pagan Europe(p. 121), a historytextbook written by two practicing Heathens of the late 20th century. The book is very nicelydone and stays only with history as it has been documented. ”Legendary histories” such as thoseof the modern movement of Wicca or the older Freemasonry while mentioned are treated as un-substantiated claims.

Midgard67Northern Europe has a long history of regarding the earth, or at least specificplaces, as being holy, and this holds true not only for the Germanic peoples, but theCelts and Balts as well. The Roman historians, Tacitus and Procopius, both writingbefore 500 CE, discuss in their records of the North the importance of “sacred”places, which include islands, wells or springs, groves, hills and trees, and mentionthat these were named after Gods, spirits, or ancestors.10What remains today,however, are place-names that can be traced back to their etymological origins, andthese have been studied quite in depth since the development of historical linguisticsduring the middle of the last century. H. R. Ellis Davidson inThe Lost Beliefs ofNorthern Europestates that the “the study of the landscape and of the names givento local features that go back to early times”11is an important area of study, butthat caution is necessary in the interpretation of the information because many ofthese place-names are not as old as first speculated. A study of about 100 Icelandicplaces suffixed with the word-hof(usually denoting “temple”) was made in ca. 1910CE, and it was found that only about 5 of these existed in the early 1800’s. Shewarns that great “caution is needed, since even ifhofnames can be traced backto medieval times, they may merely indicate chapels built by the Christians, sothat there is little reliable evidence on which to draw” (pp. 54-55). The studies doreveal, though, that many ancient sites are generally associated with the worshipof Þór, Tyr, Frigg, Frey, Óðínn, and in northern Scandinavia, Ullr. Many of theseplaces have been confirmed as ancient religious sites, as opposed to habitation sites,through archeological excavation of pits containing what are obviously offerings andfire pits which are not the size or shape of normal cooking/ house-hold fires.In history recorded by the Germanic peoples themselves, there are places whichseem always to have been holy to the people; these would include meeting places forsecular/ legal/ religious reasons, and places which have been dedicated to ancestralspirits or particular Gods within the range of the sagaic era which extended roughlyfrom about 700 CE - 1300 CE. Iceland, in particular, has a large number of these,Thingavellir, the ancient place of the Icelandic parliament, and Helgafell (the nameof several mountains, actually) being some of the more famous. Uppsala in Swedenhas also been much described particularly by the German monk, Adam of Bremen.Family land holdings in the North have been important throughout all of writtenhistory with the rights to the holdings ever being passed down to the eldest son,but Moberg inA History of the Swedish Peopleconsiders the smallest unit of freesociety to have been the village rather than the family:10Idunnavols.4; 1-2; James Chisolm, “The Grove and the Gallows, 1992.11See p. 54-55 of Davidson’s book for a short discussion of cautions about reading too muchinto the old place-names. This is something that is often thrown to the wind in some of the newerliterature and articles."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard68“The village was the peasants’ castle. Its raison d’etre was mutual as-sistance. In illness, want or danger they came to each others’ assistance.Always there was someone in the village who knew how to drive out evil withfire and steel. If a cow fell sick, it was handy to have a neighbor who knewhow to cure it. Birth and marriage, death and funerals, all were the commonconcern of the village council. Agriculture too was carried out by the men ofthe village. The soil was distributed in such a way that the peasant’s plotsof land might well be scattered in thirty different places. Since the fieldswere tilled simultaneously, the work had to be done on a basis of mutualunderstanding. The cattle went out, hoof by hoof, to graze together on thecommon land. Each villager drew his water from the village well, and atfestivals all gathered on the same hillock, the ’court’ (hóf) of some god.”12He goes on to say that since about 1000 CE, there have been solitary farms onrecord, but these have always been associated with a village. The ancient Germanicpeople have always been social, community loving people as far as can be discernedfrom the archeological record, and they worked together and celebrated both lifeand death as a community.The concept of ownership is relatively new. In the 20th century “ownership”generally means “to belong to one person,” in fact, the word “own” comes fromthe same root-word as “one.” To truly have a sense of ownership, one needs alsoto embrace the idea that one is somehow immortal: one owns something now andone will continue own on into the future. This sense of continuity, however, wassomewhat foreign to the early Teutons who carried with them the idea that this lifewas somehow transient and that they would each pass away, leaving nothing butnames and memories of good deeds performed during their short stay on Midgard.This is the meaning of the formulaic line from theHávamálmentioned earlier,”Cattle die and kinsmen die, thyself eke soon wilt die.”13(Hollander, St. 76).Property was in one’s care until it was moved to another. Wealth was acquired sothat it could be given away. A kenning for a king was “gold-hater” because kings wereexpected to give what they had acquired. And ownership of land was no exceptionto this rule; it was passed on to the eldest son as the successor in stewardship overthe family lands which were lived upon and worked by the extended family. Theancestral lineage tied to the land was important so lands were often kept within thesame family, but trueownership, in the modern sense, did not develop until long12InA History of the Swedish People,p. 39, by Vilhelm Moberg. This is a very pleasant,easy-to-read history of the Swedish people republished as a two volume set by Dorset Press (NewYork) in 1989 from the original 1971 translation by Paul B. Austin.13Hollander translation,Hávamál,St. 76."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard69after the Christian invasion. By that time, people had forgotten about or neglectedancestral guardians, land-spirits (see below), and lineages of both families and land.In modern Germanic countries, lands still usually held by the same family gen-eration after generation, but this is becoming, for the most part, a matter of conve-nience. The last real vestige remaining of this ancient concept of stewardship is the“family heirloom” which is still fairly common throughout all the modern countrieswhere the descendants of Germans, Scandinavians, and Anglo-Saxons settled.Central to many communities in the north is the church and its graveyard. In-terestingly, the word in modern German for cemetery isderFriedhofand is cognateto the OEfridhgeardwhich was a sacred place where sacrificial offerings were left.The word literally translates as “peace-enclosure” where violence and bloodshed werebanned and which was often situated near plots where luck was felt to flow up fromthe Land of the Ancestors out over Midgard. Although it can not be said withany degree of certainty that thefridhgeardwas the fore-runner to the Christiancemetery, it is known and well recorded that burial mounds, howes, and barrowswere a central feature in many communities and were often considered to be theplace where wisdom could be dispensed throughout the community in the form ofreciting the laws or holding court. Additionally, the burial mound of ancestors isthe traditional place for the practice known asútisetjaor “sitting-out” which wasapparently a night-long vigil during which leaders and kings sought inspiration priorto making important decisions from the ancestors but was probably practiced bycommon folk for similar reasons as well. The topic of community cemeteries willbe expanded upon later in the chapter dealing with the underworld; the only pointbeing made here is that cemeteries have always been considered 1) a place wherefromluck and knowledge could flow out upon Midgard, and 2) by maintaining a line ofancestors buried beneath the soil, one could rest assured that the lineages of theindividuals within the community were bound well with that of the locale.The health of fields were important to the Germanic peoples, which is somewhatof an understatement since farmers’ livelihoods depended upon the ability of a fieldto produce; no farmer, even in the 20th century, can say that he does not mindif his fields are blighted or barren. However, the approach that the ancients usedwas that of “one person (really, a community) blessing and healing another.” TheAcre-botis a “field ceremony” which has survived in written form in an 11th centuryAnglo-Saxon herbal preserved as a manuscript in the Harleian Collection:“Earth, divine Goddess, Mother Nature, who generatest all things . . . thouindeed art duly called great Mother of the Gods . . . . Those who rightly"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard70receive these herbs from me, do thou make themwhole(my italics), and soforth.”14Although the main body of the “Acre-Bot” is Anglo-Saxon, the rite, in varyingforms was fairly well known throughout the entire Teutonic realm and versions ofthe ceremony can be found in manuscripts, “dating from the 6th century onwards,Breslau, Florence, Montpellier, and Vienna” (Grattan &amp; Singer, p. 432), alsothere is another Anglo-Saxon version in the Cotton Collection.Some of the “field charms” were yearly ceremonies to promote fertility as inthe well known ”Erce, Erce, Erce, mother of earth . . . .” version, and some wereconducted only when a field became ill:“Here is the remedy by which you can improve your fields, if they willnot grow properly, or if any harm has been done to them by sorcery orwitchcraft.”15The reason for the rites or “charms,” as they are often called, is the same in bothcases: to bring the field and its lineage back into wholeness (health). A field whoselineage has been crossed with another more unwholesome one becomes weak andlacks access to the flow of the Waters of Life. This could happen through some formof witchcraft or simply by the stewards of the field having broken some taboo. Inany case, the treatment of the field was the same as it would be for any other beingsuffering from a similar disorder.The scholarly interpretation of these charms has been varied but always alongsimilar lines. Storms, in hisAnglo-Saxon Magic, interprets at least one of the charmsas being hymns to the Sun and to Mother Earth.16Such views seem to be left overfrom the scholastic interpretations of the late 19th century á la Frazer’sGoldenBoughwhere all mythologies were deemed to be related to a Sun God and anEarth Goddess. In the mid-20th century, this particular view became the basis ofa pseudo Earth-Religion created by the Englishman, Gerald Gardener, known asWicca. These scholarly attempts at explaining the existence of the group of charmscollectively known as the “Acre-bot” neglected out of ignorance the idea of power/luck, lineage ( ̧orlög), and the early Germanic concept that the earth or Midgardwas really part of a greater whole. It should be noted that there is no true form of14Grattan and Singer article as quoted in Bonser’sThe Medical Background of Anglo-SaxonEngland,p. 431.15In Storms’Anglo-Saxon Magicpublished by the Hague ca. 1941.

The charms were conducted with thestewards of the land playing the role of Whole-maker or healer curing the land.Another ceremony, which had a relatively common form throughout the entireGermanic realm, was the leading of a wagon containing either a wooden image ofa deity of fertility or a human representative of a god or goddess through the localarea to promote an abundance of crops for the year. Usually, this rite took placein the spring so it can be assumed, at least according to the ideas being profferedhere, that the purpose of this ceremony was to “groom the lineages of people, places,and animals” so that all had good access to power/ luck. There is a description ofthe rite probably related to the Goddess Nerthus in Tacitus’Germaniaas havingtaken place in Denmark around the 1st century CE, and another two mentioned intheFlateyjárbókas having taking place in Sweden during the Viking Age. Mobergdescribes this ceremony and it’s probable relationship to a ceremony still conductedby the Swedish monarchy:“Each summer the wooden image of Frej [sic], set up in a wagon, madea journey through Sweden. Carried round the country to bless the grain onthe fields, the god promoted the year’s growth and reproduction. It is herewe probably have the origin or theEriksgata, a progress through the realmstill undertaken by Swedish kings after their accession.”17According to Snorri in theYnglingasaga, the kings of Sweden trace there ancestryback to the God, Frey, and because of this lineage the kings have access to thepower/ luck of that lineage:“They [the kings of Sweden] were worshipped by their subjects as pos-sessing supernatural powers. The common people believed their rulers couldregulate natural processes as they pleased, distribute rain and sunshine asmight best help the crops and promote the fertility of man an beast, produc-inghealthy, well-fashioned offspring free of all blemish or deformity. Undera good king the grain was plentiful, women became pregnant, cows calved,man and beast multiplied, and no monsters were born into the worldldots. Aslong as a ruler could prove his divine power by the happy courses of nature,he sat safely on his throne.”18As representative of a divine lineage, the Swedish king then traveled throughout hisrealm to allow all lands, beasts, and men to interact with him so that lineages wereintertwined and all life within the realm were increased in power/ luck.

Midgard72speaking of Gods, men, places, or objects. Interpretations of the ceremony in termsof Earth-Worship (as is often done) is not necessary because the increase in accessto luck here functions the same as it did for the lineage of Beowulf to interact withthe giantish sword–simply an interaction between lineages and an intertwining ofluck/ health/ wholeness.Without going into a deep analysis of the various field charms, a quick overviewshows that there are certain elements which are common to most of them. First,turves or sods were taken from each corner of the field and were marked so that theycould be placed back exactly as they were dug up. These sod-blocks represented theextreme boundaries of the land to be healed. These were then taken to be “blessed.”Secondly, a gift was made to the field itself. (This is consistent with what has alreadybeen discussed in the first chapter on gift-giving and the linking of lineages.) Thegifts usually consisted of incense, herbs, bread, yeast, milk, honey, and oddly, in theAnglo-Saxon tradition, old soap. Another charm also lists seeds collected from abeggar who was paid back in double. The prayer was directed to the “east” whichseems significant since usually prayers were directed to the northern quadrant ofthe compass. However, the spring of the year and the eastern quadrant are linked.Spring was felt to enter Midgard from the east. This eastern “tie” will be discussedin a section dealing with the northern skies (The Sky Connection) and also in thechapter dealing with the Underworld Tradition of the North, but it is clear thatthe eastern direction was important to the field ceremonies. Lastly, the turves werereturned their exact spots in the field bringing the ceremony to completion.The exact process of the “blessing” depended entirely on the religious orientationof the community. Early on, these blessings, of course, were completely Heathenin nature, but later on, some of these were mixed with Christian elements andHeathen elements were reduced in strength so that only terms such as “EorþanMoðer” (Mother Earth) and a conspicuously unnamed “God Almighty” were usedin the charms. Apparently, these terms were found acceptable by the Church. Thepurpose of the blessing was to call upon the powers that exist to help protect thefield from maliciousness. Originally, these powers were probably the Vanir, the álfar,or ancestral spirits all of whom seem closely related at least as far as agriculture isconcerned, and possibly Þór who protects Midgard from attacks by either giant ortroll forces.Cemeteries have already been mentioned as being a central focus for geographiccommunities, but certain burial mounds of specific ancestors, and especially kings,were considered to be the spirit home of local protectors of the fields. In Snorri’sHeimskringlathere is the case of Hálfdan the Black’s death and what occurred inthe countryside thereafter:“Now when the king drove over that stretch, the ice broke under him, and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard73he perished with many of his followers. He had reached his fortieth year then.There had been excellent seasons during his rule; and people were so affectedby his death that when they learned of his demise and that his body wasbeing returned to Hringariki in order to be interred there, men of influencefrom Raumariki, Westfold, and Heithmork came and prayed, all of them, totake the body with them to be buried in their lands; for it was thought thathe who got possession of it could expect good seasons.They reached an agreement in this wise, that the body was assigned tofour places: the head was laid in a mound at Stein in Hringariki, but eachof the others carried away their share and interred them in burial mounds intheir homelands, and all are called the Mounds of Hálfdan.”19The king’s power/ luck which had been increased over the forty years of his reign stillpoured out over the surface of Midgard even after his death, and, for a communityto access that power, gifts or sacrifices had to be given “for aye doth a gift look forgain.”20Since the eddaic and sagaic literature is primarily heroic in nature, ancestorsof either a family or of a community are rarely mentioned. Communities such asvillages belonged to the peasantry. Holmberg, speaking of the Finno-Ugric peoplesays that“the duties of the living with regard to the dead do not cease when thelatter have been carried to the grave with all honors. The dead continue toneed the help and care of the living. If a dead man is not given his rights, hemay resent it and, coming back, disturb the peace of his survivors.”21Although Holmberg is speaking of a culture east of the Germanic realm, there was alarge overlap in folk customs so that customs of the Swedes differ from those of theFinns for the most part in language only. The western Finns, for example, celebratedtheir general memorial feast for their ancestors at Yule or Halloween with the samecustoms as the Swedes; however, Christianity, as it existed in Sweden, covered upmany of the ceremonial aspects of these holidays which were to placate the dead forthe upcoming year.“In Germany and Scandinavia it was said that they came back at eitherHalloween or at Christmas, and there are records of food left out for them onChristmas Eve and the fire made up, while folk went to Mass. Next morning19Hollander translation, pp. 57-58, 1964.20Hávamál, St.. 145, Terry translation.21Holmberg, Umo,Finno-Ugric Mythology,p. 37, 1928."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard74their footprints might be seen on the ashes of the hearth, and in Iceland elveswere said to visit houses in a similar way.”22Davidson later presents a case from the Orkneys where an ancestral spirit (haugbuior “hogboy”) dwelling in a mound near a farm was periodically offered milk or winefor his protective services. When a farmer desecrated the dwelling place, a revengeof six cows was exacted. The most interesting part of the story, however, is that ittook place as late as the beginning of the 20th century.23Because the Vikings moved about often settling in new places, they were oc-casionally confronted with land-holdings which had no ancestors underneath. Thishappened in the case of the early Germanic invasions into Celtic or Baltic lands,Iceland, and Greenland. Since access to power/ luck was of greatest importance,they resorted to other methods. It is commonly reported, for example, that Vikinginvaders would “rape” the women of a country being invaded. So much so, in fact,that the idea of “rape” was often synonymous with “Viking invasion,” and there is nodoubt that these invaders most likely enjoyed their work. The end product of sucha brutal practice, however, was that the lineages of the invaders and the inhabitantsof the country being invaded were intertwined, giving the Vikings access to thepower/ luck of that land. Often the women who were raped were the daughters andwives of local leaders meaning that the lineage being interacted with was strong. Ifthe Vikings were simply brutal barbarians as some scholars believe, then why notrape and torture or kill the women or perhaps keep them as personal concubines?Usually, the women were left in their homelands to raise the illegitimate children ofthe invaders.There were other occasions when the country being “invaded” had no inhabitants,such as Iceland.“In early Iceland the dead could hardly be pictured as waiting in theirmounds for an opportunity to visit the living. There seems little doubtthat the natural world in both Celtic and Germanic areas was held to bepeopled with independent spirits dwelling in rocks, waterfalls, springs, andmountains. These were prepared to befriend the living and make the landfertile, but violence and bloodshed were offensive to them, in contrast tothe battle-spirits. No doubt the dead in their graves might also help theliving, and the spirit of a dead king, in particular, might possess such powers.Iceland, however, was without kings or ancestors, and there seems to havebeen a vigorous belief in a host of supernatural powers in wild places as wellas on the farms, and in natural hills as well as in burial places. The spirits22Davidson, H .R. E.,Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe, p.114,1988.23ibid."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard75driven out when Christianity came were not those of the pre-Christian deadwithin the earth. . . . As time went on, the power of dead ancestors becameimportant in Iceland as it had been in the land from which the Icelanderscame.”24Folktale collections from Iceland contain a very large percentage of tales dealing withdifferent land- or nature-spirits. Greenland was a country which presented a similarproblem. However, by the time the Germanic peoples settled there, Christianity,which took a dim view of the worship of ancestors and nature-spirits, was the domi-nant religion. The Greenland colony under Christian rule lasted approximately 300years before it failed. Perhaps one of the reasons for its failure as opposed to thesuccessful colonies of the Faroes, Shetlands, Orkneys, and Iceland was related to thefailure to establish a true relationship to the land. Certainly, there were other moreeconomically based reasons which satisfy the modern scholar, but the coincidence iscurious nevertheless.One of the roles of an ancestor after death was to help maintain the familialties to power/ luck, but the example of Iceland also demonstrates that there wereroles played by other beings which had an effect on the luck of the land-holding aswell. These beings were often bound to a specific geographical area and were calledbytusseorhuldrafolk. Such beings were non-organic (“never having been flesh andblood”) but had a lineage which ran through a limited geographical area whichsometimes is described as “7 miles by 7 miles”25in modern folklore. InScandinavianMythologyDavidson writes more at length regarding these land-spirits:“Such spirits do not seem to be regarded as ancestral, linked with particu-lar families, but rather as powers who resided in the very land itself. It was ofthe utmost importance for settlers in Iceland, a new and uninhabited country,to come to terms with them and win their favor. There are references in thesagas to mountain or cliff-giants, who were linked with certain features of theIcelandic landscape.”2624ibid.,p. 115.25InScandinavian Folk Belief and Legend,Kvideland and Sehmsdorf relate several folktaleswhich talk of the importance of boundaries in Germanic folklore. Some boundaries were natural,such as rivers or rocks, some were man-made such as roads or boundary-markers at the edge ofthe farm and some seem to be a combination of the two, such as 7 mi. x 7 mi. or 3 leagues froma particular point. Another curious feature of Germanic folklore is the more powerful the being,the wider the area it roams. Land-wights, farm-wights, and ancestors are spot specific; heroes,demi-gods, and ancestral leaders govern a region; and Gods travel the world over.26op.cit.,p. 117, 1969."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Chapter 3.

Goðafoss–Falls of the GodsIt makes good sense that the early settlers of Iceland would try to make peace withthese beings because they knew that it was the only way to tap into the land’spower/ luck without which life in the new country was sure to be unsuccessful.The next obvious question would be why these indigenous, non-organic beingswould even bother with men. After all, they are obviously more powerful and moreknowledgeable than men, and being discorporate, they are not in need of food orwealth. Davidson provides a clue:“Another race of beings linked closely with the earth were the land-spirits,said to follow ‘lucky’ men and to give help with hunting and fishing.”27Since the only real difference between these beings and men is the fact that menhave bodies (wherewith comes the need for food, shelter, clothes, etc.), and sincethese beings are an expression of the flow of the Waters of Life as they move throughthe Tree (for everything that could ever possibly exist is part of the Tree in earlyTeutonic world-view), then they are looking for the exact same thing that menare: a life of honor, value, and worth, which are built through interaction withother beings of power/ luck, as discussed in Chapter 1.

To strip everything down to its basiccore, all beings are little more than lineages seeking to interact with each other.It should be noted that although the termhuldrafolkbasically translates as abeing that “cannot be seen by humans, normally,” or “Hidden Folk,” it is not usuallyapplied to beings known as trolls, dwarves, or giants. There seems to be a differencein lineages. The lineages of giants can be traced can be traced back to Ymir andhis descendants. Apparently, early on, the race of giants was split into two basicgroups: 1) Ymir up through Bergelmir and his wife who survived the flood causedby the outpouring of blood after Ymir was killed (calledthursr), and 2) Buri upthrough a split lineage, one being the race of Gods, the other being giants (calledjötunar). Dwarves and trolls trace their lineages back to the corpse of Ymir, butare not truly the offspring of Ymir. Men trace there lineage back to the first manand woman, Ask and Embla, created by the Gods from trees with the same names,and land-spirits appear to have a similar lineage to people, most likely created bythe Gods (the Vanir) out of the Tree as opposed to dwarves, trolls and giants whocame into being prior to the existence of the Tree. According to folklore, all beingscan interact with the lineages of men, but those who have a lineage resembling thatof man tend to have the greater number of interactions.In the story of the creation of the World Tree, there are three Wells: 1) Hvergelmir,2) Mímir, and 3) Urð. It may very well be that the lineages of trolls, dwarves, andgiants (thursr) are related primarily to the Waters flowing out of Hvergelmir, theGods,Jötnar, and álfar to Mímir, and that men and ancestors spring forth fromUrdhr. This, however, is pure speculation with no real evidence to be gleaned fromeddaic, sagaic, or folkloric literature.There is another curiosity, however, and although it is merely conjecture, whenlooked at in light of the importance that the early Germanic peoples placed onlineages, appears to make sense out what has been confusing ever since scholars havebeen attempting to interpret Northern Mythology: the War between the Æsir andthe Vanir. The War between the Æsir and the Vanir relates back to an event where awitch of the Vanir comes to Ásaheim, and the Æsir suspecting some type of treasontry to kill her unsuccessfully. But it is the resolution of the war that is significant.The Æsir given as hostages to the Vanir were Mímir, a giant with impeccable wisdomand memory extending back to the beginning of time, and Hoenir, one of the threewho created humans. The Vanir given as hostages were Njörd, a God normallyassociated with wealth, prosperity, and the sea, and Freyr, a God associated withprosperity and fecundity of the earth and the ruler of Alfheim which was given tohim by the Gods as a toothgift.28Perhaps, there was a different cause for the War than is usually suggested. Sup-28A tooth-gift was a gift presented to a child at the cutting of his first tooth."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard78pose, initially, there was a scramble to populate Midgard, and the beings createdby the Æsir were people, and those created by the Vanir were the álfar/landvaetter(land-spirits). To resolve the conflict each side sends a God of extreme intelligenceand one of the creators of each side’s proposed populace for Midgard. The resolutionin the home of the Gods resulted in the Æsir and the Vanir living side by side, andthe resolution for Midgard was for man and land-spirit to live side by side with theonly real difference between the two being that the land-spirits were discorporateand non-organic.The evidence from the sagaic, eddaic, and poetic literature is scanty. However,an interpretation of the tale as a ”contest” between the tribes of Gods provides amotivating factor for the initiation of the conflict between the Gods and a rationalreason why land-spirits/ elves and men must seek to live in harmony with oneanother. It also offers some explanation as to why the cults of the álfar and of theancestors appear to overlap to the point of one being confused for the other. Lastly,it means that the Æsir did not overthrow the earlier worshipped Vanir but that thetwo tribes of Gods may have been worshipped together, or at least side by side, fromvery early on. Turville-Peter alludes to such in hisMyth and Religion of the North:“From such records as we possess, it does not appear that the polytheisticpagans of Scandinavia and Germany were so dogmatic or fanatical in theirreligious beliefs that they would be likely to go to war for the worship ofone tribe of gods or another. This first war in the world seems to be partof the creation myth. It explains how the [G]ods who promoted such dif-ferent interests as the Vanir and Æsir lived in friendship29. . . . They explainhow gods and men, who have such different interests and ambitions, as theagriculturalist, the merchant, the warrior and the king, can live together inharmony.”30According to such a view, because of their similar origins, land-spirits and men aredestined live side by side, by the same set of rules, interacting with one anotherthrough gift-giving, honor and respect. The relationship is tenuous, however, be-cause people are ever prone to petty squabbling, thievery, oath-breaking, lying, etc.,and land-spirits appear to be vengeful by nature, often being the source of diseaseto land, animal, or man.That the Huldrafolk were created by the Gods, similar to men, can be seen inthe Heathen idea that Álfheim was ruled over by Freyr, one of the Vanir, and inthe Christian idea that they were either the first children or the “hidden children”29InMyth and Religion of the North, by Turville-Petre (rpt. by Greenwood Press, Westport,Ct.) p. 160, 1964.30op. cit.,p. 162, 1964."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Chapter 3.

As creations of the Gods or of the Christian God,however, the lineages of both man and land-spirit are similar, and as a consequence,interactions between the two are common even in the most current folklore.There is much power in these interactions between lineages. Of all the Heathenknowledge and customs that the Church tried to eradicate, those dealing with localnature-spirits were by far the most difficult either to alter or get rid of. Knowledgeof some of these non-organic forces is still alive and well in all countries havingEuropean ancestry, although in some cases, like the United States, European beliefshave meshed with those of the indigenous peoples. The popularity of these beingscan be gleaned from any trip to the local bookstore, knick-knack shop, or even bywatching children’s cartoons on an afternoon after school. Gnomes, fairies, unicorns,gargoyles, nisses, necks, devas, dryads, naiads, mermaids, elves, and pixies can beseen every day in some of the most unlikely places. Even Christian angels of the20th century are little more than elves with wings. Sometimes, to be as ”politicallycorrect” as possible and not to offend Fundamentalist Christian groups, Huldrafolkare given made-up names likeThe Smurfsin the hope that fewer Fundamentalistswill take notice. Knowledge of nature-spirits is part of the living folk memory, andas long as Disney Cartoons, Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and the Wizard of Oz are stillaround, there is no chance of the memory being erased.The early Germanic concept of these hidden beings, however, was much differentthan the 20th century version. For them, they were truly forces with power for bothgood and evil. Interaction with the beings was inevitable for they not only dwelt inthe wilds of the mountains and forests, but everywhere on the land-holding. Hearths,bath-houses, cellars, thresholds, barns, stables, mounds, ponds, streams, and treeswere all likely abodes for the “Hidden People” as the Huldrafolk were known, andtheir individual names depended on their abode.Of all the different branches of the Teutonic folk, the Scandinavian people haveleft the most detailed record of non-organic beings and by far the largest numberof number of names for these beings. The names, however, are not usually personalnames of the beings, which by tradition the beings themselves did not give awayfor fear of giving away their own personal control and power, but are “noa-names”which describe only their roles or places of residence. Kvideland and Sehmsdorf inScandinavian Folk Belief and Legenddescribe them as being probably of the samespecies with names varying according to their roles:“The protection and welfare of the farmhouse and its immediate surround-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard80ings found expression in traditions about a solitary being called by variousnames.31Some of the farm beings recorded areTomte(in the northwestern districts),Nisse(in the southeastern),Gaardvord(literally, “yard-guardian”),Tusse,(invisible farm-hand), andTunkellwho seems to have held the “luck” of the farm from the originalman-settler onwards and was attached specifically to a farm and not to the familyas were the Nisse or the Tomte. Also there is another interesting dweller, aHaugbui(literally, a “mound-dweller) who may or may not have been ancestral in nature;the dwelling in the mound may have been a burial place. Other terms occasionallycrossed in the sagaic literature areArmaðrandSpámaðr.The function of many ofthese beings overlap and not all farms had them all as non-organic inhabitants.Some of the beings appear to be closely attached to the human household whileothers are more attached to the land. Thearmaðr(literally, “hearth man”) asdescribed in the saga of Ólaf Tryggvasson is one who seems attached to the householdand in stories where a family packs belongings and moves such a being will oftenmove with them; however, thetunkellis attached to the luck of the land. Kvidelandand Sehmsdorf paraphrasing Svale Solheim from a 1951 article on “Yard-fellows”state that“Solheim interprets the Norwegian materials as the remains of an ancientancestral cult; according to Solheim, thetunkellrepresents the original ownerof the farm, and, thus, the sum of good luck and prosperity associated withthe farm.”32Although these beings were associated with the land specifically, it was possibleto drive them out by destroying the residence, often an outbuilding or bunkhouse,which became a common act after the introduction of new agricultural techniquesand due to the indifference or antagonism of Christianity towards providing a specialdwelling area for these land-spirits.Offerings are reported to have been left for these domestic spirits well into thiscentury, but the attitude of the general populace, as recorded in modern folklore,towards these beings has been slowly leaning towards the view of them as a nuisancerather than a blessing. However, the 1994 Winter Olympics opening ceremony fromLillehammer, Norway, included scenes of land-spirits in a choreographed “battle”with “trolls” (landvættir) which may represent a shift in attitude toward this part ofthe northern Germanic heritage since the “good” land-spirits were indeed presentedin a traditional beneficent fashion.31op. cit.,p. 238.32Kvideland and Sehmsdorf, p. 247, 1988."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard81The benefits of interacting with the lineages of land-spirits revolved around main-taining one’s wholeness, one’s quality of life, in general, and increasing access toluck/ power. Individual and family health was maintained as the ancestral landsprospered. As with interacting with powerful human beings, one’s access to luck/power (ON =heill) was increased through interaction with powerful non-organicbeings as well. In a few recorded cases an individual was lead to buried wealthwhich improved the overall standing of the family within the community. The pro-tective function of these beings also took the form of presages of deaths, visitorsand approaching “bad luck” in whatever form it might take, and in at least onerecorded story collected by Ivar Aasen in 1842 agaardvordbeat up and killed a trollwhich had threatened a man’s life.33In spite of the wonderful benefits of interactingwith the lineage of a land- or domestic-spirit, the relationship was always tense anddangerous to some degree.The results of either knowingly or unknowingly interacting with these non-organicbeings in a inappropriate fashion could have dire results because the breaking of aspecific taboo would not only result in one’s family’s losing access to power/ luck,but also because the non-organic beings of either household or the wilds were noto-rious for exacting revenge. Revenge, although often directed at the taboo-breaker,was often carried out with unbaptized babies or couples immediately prior to theirweddings being very easy targets most likely because they had not been officiallyblessed and therefore under the protection of the Church. Acceptance of the Chris-tian religion was supposed to help protect one from the vengeful activities, but theHeathen utilized other protection in the form of charms or simply by setting thingsright with the offended spirit if it was at all possible. Ignorance was considered tobe of no protection whatsoever.Revenge was often considered to be a primary cause for disease, infant mortality(which was high at the time), death of mothers during childbirth, deformities ofchildren at birth (probably the source of “the changeling stories” in northern Euro-pean folklore), madness, or an individual’s simply disappearing (being lost foreverin the wilderness, for example). Madness, coma, and general malaise in culturessurrounding the Teutonic realm such as the Saamí or the Finns were, and still are,considered in the folk culture to be related to soul or power theft by non-organicbeings and is best treated by charms, ceremonies, or, in the worst cases, by theCunning Man (noaide), or the Whole-Maker. Within the Germanic realm, thereare a number of diseases well-recorded in not only the sagaic and folkloric literaturewhich are directly attributed to these non-organic beings (usually with the prefixalf-attached) but also in early and medieval herbals:33Folktales of Norwayby Reidar Christiansen, tr.

But these beings by theirnature are as fickle as people. Some are pleasant and easy to get along with, some aremean and love to deceive or trick people into either failure or dangerous situations,and some are simply indifferent. When having to deal with such unpredictability, itis easy to understand, in the long run, why some people have preferred not to have tointeract with these beings at all if given the choice. In several stories, farmers builtoutbuildings over the dwellings of thetunkelland were either required to move thebuilding or get rid of the spirit at the risk of losing the luck of the farm. On the otherhand, a large percentage of Celts Germans, Finns, Scandinavians, Saamí and variousislanders have opted to endure the tenuous relationship and its associated risks asopposed to ignoring thetusse-folkaltogether, perhaps bringing even a greater riskover the course of time. In the Heathen way of thinking, developing and maintaininga good relationship with the spirits of the area was considered to be the best practiceeven though it meant extra work and caution, for a good relationship resulted inhealth, luck, and prosperity for the family and community.The Christian conversion of the North was not a simple affair which was ac-complished over a few decades; it was a long term effort by the Church, which haslasted almost one and a half millennia, with knowledge about land-spirits, ancestors,elves, and other huldrafolk being the last Heathen practice to be eradicated. Peoplecould be forced to give lip service to the Abrahamic God, and the Church couldmake claims of eternal salvation after death, but its track record for increasing ormaintaining the prosperity of a farm was no better than the older system.

After the work was done there was still a certain amount oftrusting to one’s luck that the crops wouldn’t fail or that the grass would be goodor that the animals didn’t succumb to some epidemic, and obviously the Germanicpeoples, particularly in the far north, felt more comfortable trusting their luck tolocal spirits than to a foreign God who seemed more concerned about life after deaththan the dirt in the fields.If one allows that the eddaic and sagaic writings are representative of the people’sattitudes towards nature at the time of their commitment to manuscript and in spiteof the fact that there are most certainly Christian interjections and interpretationsin the texts, then the early Teutons were possibly not truly animistic in their phi-losophy. Animism implies that everything has a soul and a life to some degree,and some researchers enjoy pursuing evidence of such a philosophy believing thatall primitive peoples must buy into animism in one form or another.

One couldalso choose to take the perspective of lineage, and in doing so would quickly noticethat all things are “alive” in the sense that they all have a past or an ̧orlög.Nodirect evidence for such can be found in any of the Germanic writings, but suchcan easily be implied applying techniques of analysis similar to those which inspiredBauschatz or Glosecki. Which ever view one takes makes little difference in the longrun because it is quickly realized that all things must be treated with a degree ofrespect either as individual objects or as part of a larger domain under the care ofsome local guardian.For many moderns, an animistic worldview is frightening because any singleaction, no matter how small, may inadvertently irritate the spirit living within athing and may result in revenge for an act unknowingly committed or that beforeacting an individual would have to spend an inordinate amount of time asking forpermission which would result in very slow progress overall. For societies whichthrive on progress such as the industrial nations of the 20th century, such a processwould be slow and laborious. Additionally, it is well stated that modern Christiansbelieve that the “things” of this world are under the dominion of man, and so ananimistic worldview would not only be a hindrance to progress, but would alsostand in direct opposition to their God-given right to do what is necessary for thebetterment of mankind.

Midgard84animism considering it to be the most primitive of all religious beliefs and believing itto be the main reason why so-called primitive societies such as tribes in the Amazonor the East Indies have such a difficult time moving into the industrialized world.There is also something frightening about animism for 20th century man resultingin an overall distrust of animistic religions such as Voudoun, Santería, and some ofthe African tribal religions to the extent that an entire genre of “horror literature”has been created around the practices and practitioners.Such opinions are ill-founded and represent an egocentric human resistance tochanging one’s point of view rather than any real threat to progress. The earlysettlers of Iceland, for example, sought to live in harmony with their new environ-ment by seeking the assistance the local genii of the prospective settlement throughthe ritualized custom of gift-giving (offerings, sacrifices). Such an approach actuallyfacilitated progress rather than hinder it. Animism has little, if anything, to do withprogress; it has much more to do with acting out of an attitude of respect and honorfor those things outside of oneself, and a general sensitivity to the fact that no act isever committed in isolation of anything else. In 1992, a funeral service was held onthe rooftop of a large Japanese microchip firm. The services were conducted by aBuddhist monk and were performed for the benefit of the souls of all the microchipswhich were sacrificed over the past year through experimentation and through thedestruction of inferior products. The funeral was considered ”normal” by most ofthe Japanese population, including the administrators of the firm, but was “bizarre”enough in a western sense that it rated 10 minutes of airtime on National PublicRadio. Japan is considered to be a very progressive country, although many westernpeople feel that its sense of tradition is somewhat ”backwards,” “out- of-date,” orat least somewhat unnecessarily “old-fashioned.” These same western people alsonotice what seems to be a paradox between the practice of ancient tradition andthe development of high technology with its concomitant domination of the worldeconomy in Japan. Paradoxes only exist, though, for philosophically rigid peoplewho are unable to readjust their world view so that it reflects reality.The early Germanic peoples, at least during the Viking Age and shortly there-after, ranged greatly from being “highly superstitious” as is recorded in Tacitus’Germaniato devout atheists such as the Dane, Hrolf Kráki. Turville-Peter devotesan entire chapter to ”the Godless Men” in hisMyth and Religion of the Northbutconcludes the chapter with a discussion about the need even for these men to sub-scribe to the cultural, moral philosophy of the day which is best represented in theHávamál(discussed in Chap. 1). Animism, land-spirits, and polytheism are thoughtby many to be incompatible with many philosophies of the 20th century, but theidea that the world or Midgard is composed of a highly complex set of relationships,and that any act that is committed is never done in complete isolation, is not."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Midgard85The concept of ̧orlögwas understood by those who did not embrace any religion.They may not have believed in the World Tree, Yggdrasil, but they understood itsfunction; they may not have accepted the idea of the flowing of the Waters of Life,but they understood the workings of power;“Among these unbelievers was the Danish Hrolf Kráki, ‘most famous of allkings of ancient days’. Neither Hrolf nor his chosen champions ever sacrificedto the gods, but believed only in their own might and main (ON =a mattsinn ok megin). Hrolf once exclaimed that it was not the wicked Óðínn whogoverned men’s lives, but rather fate (auðna).”36In spite of the fact that atheists, or near atheists, existed, everyone (for the mostpart, because there are always exceptions) subscribed to the same set of spiritualprinciples. Turville-Petre in his discussion about the possible origins of theHávamáland the common knowledge that this poem was composed by several skalds (Ger-manic poets) even suggests that part of it may have been written by one or severalof these “godless men.”“Although the titleHávamál(Sayings of the High One) is given to thewhole collection only two of the first seventy-nine strophes contain allusion toÓðínn. The rest tell hardly anything about religion or belief in gods.

Yet the titleHávamális not altogether inappro-priate, even to this part of the collection. As I have attempted to explain,the cult of Óðínn, in some of its aspects, represents a breach with traditionand a rejection of traditional morality and social organization. In this waythe cult of Óðínn draws near to atheism.”37The author is addressing the fact that many men left their homelands and commu-nities during the Viking Age to sail the open seas. These men did not remain inany single place long enough to embrace any of the religious/ cultural aspects of thelocale but still felt the need to adhere to a spiritual philosophy which would enablethem to access power/ luck during their short stay on Midgard. This sophisticatedphilosophy was collected at some point during the Viking Age or within a few cen-turies thereafter and has come down through the centuries known as theHávamál.As discussed in Chapter 1, the poem is a collection of pieces of wisdom which whenapplied in life will allow an individual to grow in luck and power.

Midgard86to walk through life with respect and honor towards all life on Midgard, friend orfoe, and that action and interaction are the keys to accessing the Waters of Life.For the early Germanic peoples, Midgard was the place where all changes aremade. ̧orlögis the state of the Waters and in itself is static. Changes in one’s accessto power/ luck are made through deeds either for the good or bad. According tothe ancient cosmology as it exists today, the Waters rise up from their source, passthrough Midgard and, consequently, through the acts of Midgard which modify it,then into the realms of the Gods where it is redispersed back through Midgard inits changed form (through the Well of Urð), and back down to the source where thecycle is started over. All beings within the realm of the World Tree are involved inthe movement of these Waters, but Midgard, the realm of action, is the only placewhere they are modified, reshaped, and changed.Both tribes of the Germanic pantheon knew this, and for this reason there origi-nally was a “war” over Midgard which was resolved by resolving to work jointly. Theend result of this resolution was that no one group of beings, or Gods, would havecomplete dominion over Midgard. Through joint effort ̧orlögis continually modifiedand in this way the End of the World Tree, orRagnarökas it is called in the eddaicpoetry, is held off. In a sense, all beings are striving for the continued existence of theTree, Yggdrasil. The image of the Tree constantly renewing itself was discussed inChapter 1; the Tree is constantly being destroyed by forces hostile to it. The serpentNiðhögg and her brood is gnawing at the roots and the heavenly harts nibble at thetender new growth, but the Tree is ever repairing itself by allowing the Waters of Lifeto trickle back down through the lands in its protection into Hvergelmir, the source.The role that Midgard plays in this scheme of things is to continually to modifythe shape of these Waters ( ̧orlög) so that when they are poured upon the Tree bythe Keepers of the Well of Urð, they heal the wounds which are inflicted over thecourse of time. The joint effort of the two tribes of Gods is to guide the inhabitantsof Middle-Earth toward changing ̧orlögin such a way to stave off the end ratherthan move towards it, and it is Their foresight and guidance, Their understandingof the larger system through the personages of Mímir, Óðínn, Kvásir, and Njörd,that guide the dwellers of Midgard.The early Germanic peoples understood their roles as well. The constant strivingto interact with power/ luck was understood not to only improve the lot of theindividual or the family, but the community and ultimately the Tree itself. Theirguidelines for this interaction has been left to modern man through the words oftheHávamál.Modern research methods have revealed that the “Sayings of the HighOne” was not written by a single person but was composed by several, and accordingto at least one researcher, possibly even one of the ”godless men.” Many interpreters"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Chapter 3.

Page inChronicles of the Vikingsaddresses this issue:“In recent years there have been attempts to divert much of this materialto the post-Christian phase of the Viking Age, and indeed to as late as thetwelfth century. . . . It is fairly clear, at any rate to the unbiased, that(whatever the date of its edition into a compositeHávamál) a good deal ofthe poem derives from earlier times. Also that a good deal of it illustratesaspects of the Viking Age not otherwise recorded, notably the life of the pooror underprivileged.”38Regardless of whether “godless men” composed part of the poem, or that it cameinto its final edition during the post-Christian Era, the poem’s content is consistentwith behaviors recorded in writings from Tacitus (in the 1st century CE) on upthrough the Age of the Saga (700 CE through 1300 CE). The phenomenon of the“godless man” seems to have been a by-product of the Viking Age possibly due tolack of exposure to one’s own homeland (community) and one’s cultural history, butit did not change the knowledge that one needed to interact with power/ luck.The conversion to Christianity apparently did not affect the common man’sknowledge/ worldview that one needed to interact with one’s environment in aharmonious fashion, and that resolution is a far better means to an end than all outextermination. Perhaps man had forgotten about the original war between the tribesof Gods, but the noble method of bringing such a problem to a good conclusion washeld in the folk-memory to the point where the Scandinavian countries of Sweden,Norway, and even Finland, at least, have been able to maintain neutrality in theworld political arena for most of the current millennium. And, although Christianityhas been able to change the face of much folk philosophy it has been unable to wipeout completely the folk belief that one needs to interact honorably and respectfullywith the spirits that also form a part of this world, whether ancestral, land/ water,or domestic.The so-called New Age has really been an attempt at turning the modern folkmind back toward a concern for the environment and the land; however, this samegroup of people has turned its view away from their own cultural heritage andtowards eastern philosophies or Native American. Eastern, Native American, andGermanic philosophies, although having some things in common, are very differentin both approach and practice. As mentioned earlier, the ultimate goal of the easternphilosophies is to blend into the One (the first bardo), but the goals of the ancientnorthern Europeans appear to have been to make peace with the third (everydayreality) and second bardos (hallucinations and “second-sight” being here equated)38ibid.p. 140."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Chapter 3.

For modern man, looking at the world through the eyes of the ancient Teutonsresults in a very different view than he is accustomed to. The Earth is no longerhere solely for the purpose of serving man, but it is to be participated in as a partof a grander scheme. Individual objects, no longer owned, exist in relationship toall other things so that any action committed on one thing is not done in isolationbut affects a myriad of things.

Additionally, ancient Scandinaviaengaged in farming and herding indicating that there was much time for observationof the movements of the heavenly bodies for marking seasons, etc., but the greatestamount of information pertaining to sky lore must have been handed down orallythrough a different tradition of folklore than stories and legends since we have onlyscanty descriptions in written form.This dearth of information regarding the sky lore of the ancient northern Euro-peans is fact, yet there are more than a couple of modern writers/ astrologers whohave spent “years” allegedly re-creating systems of astrology based on Celtic or Norsesky lore apparently pulling their information out of thin air.Omenswere knownand are occasionally described in a document here and there. The Anglo-SaxonChronicles, the name given to a collection of handwritten periodic descriptions inreport form of significant events occurring in England from 1 CE to 1154 CE, evengives what is considered to be an early description of Halley’s comet and its evilportents.“A.

This kind of sooth-saying seems not to havebecome known till the latter part of the Middle Ages.”31InThe Saxon Chronicle, tr. by Rev. J.

That the night sky was important to the Germanic peoplehas been known since the time of the Roman historian Tacitus. In hisGermania,written around 0 CE, he writes that“except in the case of accident or emergency, they [the Germanii] assembleon certain particular days, either shortly after the new moon or shortly beforethe full moon. These they hold are the most auspicious times for embarkingon any enterprise.”5Even though indigenous northern European astrology is an interesting concept, itsexistence is not borne out by any of the facts as they exist today and does notappear to have had any place of importance in the Northern scheme of things.The ancient Germanic peoples were privy to much “scientific information” andmany very sophisticated technologies, such as navigation and time-keeping by thestars, but these do not appear in written form. They also understood well thetechniques of “damascened” steel for sword-making, fancy metal-working for jew-elry, very sophisticated techniques for boat-building, and had developed militarystrategy into an art-form which allowed them to rule northern Europe for almosta half millennium, but for them, writing seems to have been an art form reservedprimarily for poetry, stories, and their dearly loved histories of families, communities,and nations, not for the transmission of technical information. Incidental pieces ofinformation pertaining to the northern sciences and technologies did find their wayinto some of the sagaic and historical writings but as literary techniques to lendcredibility to their stories and as “fill-in.” Therefore, any claims to the discoveryof an indigenous northern European astrological system should be regarded as pure4ibid.p. 723.5InTacitus: The Agricola and the Germaniatr. by H.

Cultural anthropologists, archaeologists, psychologists, and other behavioralscientists occasionally come together in a team effort using historical knowledge fromtheir respective fields to recreate some of these, such as ancient sword-making orboat-building, for example. Most all of these technologies which have been recre-ated in such a fashion were used to produce artifacts such as can be found in thearcheological record from ancient grave or habitation sites: houses, clothing, jewelry,ancient cookware, weapons, boats, etc. Even certain medical practices have beenrediscovered by “team-sleuthing,” but a “system” such as astrology, without writtenor archeological evidence will remain little more than an armchair archeologist’sevening reverie.Germanic sky lore will probably always remain somewhat of a mystery, but fromthe fields of comparative folklore and comparative mythology, there is some evidencethat the skies over ancient northern Europe played a fair part in the formationand maintenance of the overall Germanic world view. Much of this informationwould reach far back into prehistoric times, however, and most likely will not everleave the realm of archeo-anthropological speculation. Consequently, much of whatfollows is little more than observations and coincidences and cannot really be proven,but backed by information from comparative folklore from neighboring geographicalareas and areas which are related to the Germanic region culturally, at least thereare some shreds of credibility to the theories presented here.There is one other concept that is probably part of the Teutonic ancestral her-itage that will need to be applied rather copiously in this presentation. It is namedafter an English philosopher of the 14th century and modern writers and scholarsoften dump it by the wayside when contemplating obscure topics such as northernEuropean sky lore: Occam’s Razor. The philosopher was William of Ockham, some-times spelled as Occam, and his philosophy was simple: the simplest explanationis often the best. Six hundred years down the line, dazzling complexity replacessimplicity, and the exquisite beauty of a Shaker chair is forgotten for all the glitterand moving parts of the “Amazing La-z-teen Vibra-lounger with Built-in End Ta-bles.” Enter: the New Age. “Vibra-lounger theories” are not necessarily wrong norare they generally malicious, they are simply overly complex, utilizing improbablecomparisons, and are usually unnecessary. All in all, the philosophy called “Occam’sRazor” is good and sound and probably can stand to be applied a little more oftenin this day and age.The wide ranging, personally collected folklore of Jakob Grimm’sTeutonic Mythol-ogyand Otto Sigfrid Reuter’sGermanische Himmelskundeplay a special role in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. The Sky Connection93the sky lore of the North. Both writers about midway through the 19th century,went about the rural areas of northern Europe collecting living folklore, and amongthe variety of information collected was much pertaining to a Germanic concept ofconstellations and their uses in a rural agricultural society. They did not find theremnants of a northern European or Germanic astrology but they did find that theyearly migration of heavenly bodies held special meaning for the farming, fishing,and herding communities as important markers of time. They found that therewere approximately 17 constellations in use at the time of the writings and manystar names which were most likelynotborrowed from the classical astronomical/astrological systems in use during the middle of the last century. A couple of theseare very interesting and form a basis for the following discussion.There are two sky features which are mentioned in the eddaic poetry; these arethe rainbow and the Milky Way. The rainbow has a long history in rural areasfrom all over northwestern Europe up to the current century of being consideredthe “brig’ o’ dread” or the Bridge of the Dead. The eddaic writings allude thatthe Bifröst or the ”Shimmering Way,” as it is described in Sturluson, not as theBridge of the Dead but rather the Bridge of the Gods, ás-bridge, or the “Power’sWay”. In England, Lapland (Finnmark; northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland),the archipelagoes of the Shetlands, Orkneys, and Faroes, and many, if not most, ofthe northeastern European localities, the Rainbow-Bridge leads to the Otherworld.Rudolf Simek inThe Dictionary of Northern Mythologyconcurs with this body offolklore and felt that Bifröst was the rainbow;6Jan de Vries, on the other hand,in hisAltgermanische Releligionsgeschichteassumes that the term Bifröst, in itstranslation as “the Shimmering Way,” refers to the Milky Way, the bright strip ofstarlight which progresses predictably through the night sky on a yearly basis, and,in northern Arctic and subarctic cultures closely adjoined to Scandinavia, the MilkyWay is indeed considered to be the road to the Land of the Dead.The World Tree and its associated “Homes” (ON =heim) is central to not onlyancient Germanic religion/ mythology, but also to both Indo-European and nonIndo-European religions as well. Cultures, diverse, and completely unrelated to theIndo-European, such as the Lakota Souix in North America, the Auricanians ofTierra del Fuego, the Mongolians of northern China, and some of the hindic sub-cultures of India share the same theme as the center of their perceived Universes.On the other hand, cultures as close as the Saamí, the Finns, the Ostiak, the Balts,and the Cheremiss of eastern Europe share a very similar belief system to the an-cient Germanic peoples, yet many modern writers prefer to search through thoseextremely distant (often not even related at all) cultures for comparative purposes.6InThe Dictionary of Northern Mythology,Rudolf Simek, tr. by Angela Hall (D.

The Sky Connection94Some even pull a little from the jewish Qabalah, a little from Assyrian astrology, alittle “channeled info from the Pleiedians” to be able to come up with highly complexsystems and charts complete with lines and circles to “make everything fit.” Thecurrent descriptions of the Germanic universe have become rather complex, but forall the knowledge available, it is not known how these ancient people truly visualizedthe World Tree and its homes.It is in the modern interpretation of the underworld, the World Tree, and the skyconnection that there is a dire need for the liberal application of Occam’s Razor. Themost recent “Germanic maps” of Yggdrasil contain nine separate worlds connectedby lines and arrows despite the fact that no such ancient depictions have ever beenfound either in written form or pictorially. The Teutons most likely started byobserving the universe around them.7They lived within a cosmos which was evermoving and changing, and learned to keep pace with the moving world around them.If the modern scientist starts with observation, he finds very quickly that symmetryand balance are but fleeting points in time, for not only does Nature abhor a vacuum,she also is not very fond of stasis. Without a static universe, lines and circles, nomatter how pretty they look, are not of much use.Watching the sky at night is an ancient pastime, still enjoyed by millions todaywhich can be educational, fun, and almost addictive especially when one has acopy of Peterson’sA Field Guide to the Stars and Planetsin hand. One can sitoutside on a summer’s evening for hours hanging names onto little points of light,naming groups of stars, and drawing mental pictures much the same way the ancientBabylonians or Romans did.Book in hand, one notices two things right away: 1) the hazy path of the MilkyWay is blatantly obvious even in many cities, and 2) it moves. Another curious thingabout this aggregation of stars that goes unobserved by many, if not most, is thatat midnight at the winter solstice it faces almost exactly north and south. Throughthe progression of the months (when observed at the same time each night), thisstripe of stars continues to change shape and rotate in a clockwise fashion so thataround April 1st it is east and west with the section shaped like a “Y” whose “arms”touch the eastern horizon. It continues to rotate on an apparent central axis so thataround October 15th it is centered again east and west with the arms of the “Y” tothe west. All these configurations are seen only at midnight.87See any of the books written by Edred Thorsson. Most of his books utilize a diagram ofthe World Tree which more closely resemble the quaballistic ”Tree of Life.” Many of the modernwriters apparently have a background in the Quaballah which is not well suited for understandingnorthern European concepts.8This phenomenon is readily observable using any commercial ”Star-Finder.” This rotatingstar map is available at most good ”chain” bookstores around the United States such as B. Dalton’sor Waldenbooks."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. The Sky Connection95There are some secondary observations which are equally interesting. The N-Sshape of the Milky Way at midnight at the winter solstice is very tight and narrow asif it were constricted or frozen in the cold of winter; whereas the E-W configurationson April 1st and Oct 15 look more like flowing streams of water. In reality, there isno change in shape; it is simply an optical illusion resulting from the Milky Way’srelationship to the horizons. Most interesting of all is that in mid-July at midnight(except in the far north where the midnight sun prevents a clear view), one can seethe Milky Way but it never makes a clean N-S shot; one side of the galaxy is eithera little too far to the southeast while the other is at the north point of the horizon,or the other is too far to the northwest.It is quite probable that the Milky Way served the ancient Germanic people as a“year-marker” of sorts. Sturluson has recorded in the Ynglinga Saga that there werethree holidays (sacrifices) during a year which were celebrated by all the Swedes andNorwegians in general.“On winter day (October 14th) there should be a blood-sacrifice for agood year, and in the middle of winter for a good crop (Yule, Þórri, Disting?);and the third sacrifice should be on summer day (April 14th), for victory inbattle.”9In Scandinavian folklore, and in those non-Germanic cultures surrounding the Ger-manic realm, these same sacrifice dates are also associated with the dead, the un-derworld, and with the cross-cultural phenomenon of the “Wild Hunt” where onecould be swept up by the swiftly moving hoards of souls following their leader who isvariously “identified as Óðínn, the devil, or some other demonic being,”10(usually oneof the álfar or elves; see Chapt. 4). People commonly believed that at these timesof the year one needed to excercise extreme caution because gates to the Land ofthe Dead stood open especially at Yule, the Middle of the winter sacrifice. BetweenApril 14th and October 14th people were basically safe from attacks out of the Landof the Dead. These dates basically coincide with the observations noted above aboutthe Milky Way in that there is no true N-S configuration for the summer months,and also with the fact that the number of nighttime hours is drastically decreasedduring the summer months.It is not known for sure that the ancient Germanic folk utilized the Milky Way inthis fashion, but this use was not unknown to the cultures immediately neighboringthe Germanic realm, and given their tendency toward trade in both goods andtechnology, it is not inconceivable that the early Scandinavians either picked up9InHeimskringla: History of the Kings of Norwayby Snorri Sturluson, tr. by Lee Hollander(University of Texas Press), p. 13, 1964.10InScandinavian Folk Belief and Legendby Kvideland and Sehmsdorf, eds., (University ofMinnesota Press) p. 273, 1988."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Chapter 4.

The Lapps (the Saamí), the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia,call the Milky WayLodde-raidaras,that is the “Path of the Birds”11(the ‘souls’), ortheJakke-moerka,the Year-Mark and definitely use the starry strip in this fashion.12The night was obviously important to the ancients; they reckoned time by nights.Tacitus in hisGermaniasays that“they do not reckon time by days, as we do, but by nights. All theirengagements and appointments are made on this system. Night is regardedas ushering in the day.”13Heathen holidays which have been passed down into the modern era are started incelebration the night before: Christmas Eve, Halloween, May Eve. Additionally,they reckoned annually by the number of winters. For them the word “year” implied“season.” The importance of the night sky as a marker of the passage of time is alsoreflected in their use of the word “moon” to mean month which was equal to two“fortnights”–note the measurment using ‘nights.’During the historical period, many of the sky lore traditions seem to have fallenby the wayside. The Roman calendar was used by the church (although runiccalendars continued to be used fairly commonly in the rural areas until well intothe late 1800’s). Whether the Milky Way, in fact, played the role as a sky-markeras well as being a candidate for the path to the Land of the Dead for the ancientTeutons is not known for certain but it can be surmised without much effort. In anycase, even though the ancient lore has been lost over the centuries to be replaced byother, more accurate, systems, the names of the ancient measurements of time havebeen retained and are still in use in virtually all the Germanic languages today.There is a third set of curious features about the Milky Way. This galaxy, fromthe point of view of the earth, is “forked” like a large letter “Y,” and the single-leggedbottom of the “Y,” near one side of the horizon, is in a compass direction 180 fromthe forked top, which touches the horizon at the opposite end of the sky (see Figure4). Reuter gives the names Vil and Van for each side of the ”fork” but the source ofhis information is not given.

These “rivers” flow around either11It is a common belief in many northern cultures (not just the Germanic) that the ’soul’leaves the body and travels to the underworld in the form of a bird or a butterfly (see J. Grimm’sTeutonic Mythology pp. 828-829).12InTuri’s Book of Lapplandby Juhan Turi (Anthropological Publications, the Netherlands)p. 289, 1966.13Tacitus,p. 110.14See Simek, p.350."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Chapter 4.

Perhapsthe arms of the “Y” were viewed by our ancestors as either a “gate” leading from theotherworld or two bridges, one leading to the sky and one leading to the underworld.Only scanty pieces of evidence can be had for either speculation. Neither classicalGermanic literature nor folklore sources contains any such specific information, butsuch a view of the night sky is neither impossible nor improbable within the confinesof Germanic cosmology.Like the Milky Way, rainbows exhibit some interesting features. They onlyappear in the morning or in the late afternoon because the sun needs to be ata fairly sharp angle from the horizon for light to be refracted properly throughwater particles in the air. Secondly, a rainbow only appears on the side of the skyopposite the sun so that in the morning a rainbow will appear in the western skyand vice-versa. Thirdly, because of the position of the sun necessary to producerainbows, south of the Arctic Circle, they will only run basically N-S direction.There is an interesting line in Snorri’sProse Edda:“There also is a place called Himinbiorg. It stands at the end of heavenat the bridge’s end where Bifröst reaches heaven.”15The point that Snorri is referring to is obviously the horizon where the edges of theunderworld, the sky realm, and Midgard all come together at the very place wherethe rainbow touches the ground. The place is unattainable by people in their crudeearthly bodies; it can only be reached by a discorporate being. Himinbjorg is theHall of Heimdall, the watching God, sometimes called the “White God.” Scholarsoften consider His duty to watch the “gates” to make sure that evil giants or trollsdo not enter into either Midgard or the sky realm. The placement of his hall ismost interesting, however; he is located at the point where the three realms cometogether giving additional credence to the idea that the same bridge, Bifröst, mayhave had a dual function in Germanic spiritual thought. It has also been shownabove that the rainbow was considered by some, including Snorri, to be the Ásbrú,and by others to be the “Brig o’ Dread.”Tony van Renterghem in his bookWhen Santa was a Shaman16speculates thatall the holidays between winternights and summernight were all originally dedicatedto the Dead, to the ancestors of the tribe, who were important to living descendentsfor luck, fertility (of animals, plants, and people), and general well being. Thetwo holidays which were specifically associated with the ancestors in Scandinavia15( InEddaby Snorri Sturluson, tr. by Anthony Faulkes, (Everyman’s Library, London) p.20, 1987.16Van Renterghem, T.

Because of the reciprocity between the middle- and underworlds(see Chapt. 4), the best time for travel for the inhabitants of the underworld wouldhave been at night in the winter (in middleworld terms) because in the Land Belowit would be early summer during the day. The primary Day of the Dead for theScandinavians was Yule–essentially Midsummer for the inhabitants of the Land ofthe Dead, and for the Celts it was Halloween or Samhain.For the inhabitants of northern Europe around 1000 CE, including the Scandi-navians, the Saamí, the Finns, The Rus (Germanic folk living in the border area/trade route along the Dnjeper), several of the east-European tribes, the Eve of theDead was somewhere between December 15th and January 15th, and the gate tothe Land of the Dead which lay far to the north, coincidentally at the north endof the rainbow-bridge and where the gate of the Milky Way lay at midnight on thewinter solstice.

Caution is necessary so thatunneeded complexity is not tossed into the picture out of habit; simplicity is farmore necessary than symmetry.Looking at the night sky, these ancient people saw fixed stars in constellationswith a hazy, star-studded band of light running through and around them. Atmidnight, once a year, the “open end” of the frozen, solid-appearing band of starsled directly from the center of the common night spectacular known to us as theaurora borealisto a point which passed immediately over the Land of the Living. Allthe colors were certainly awe-inspiring, but the flashing curtains of reds brought tomind bloody battles they had known in their lives with memories of ancestors andrelatives who had fallen by the sword. Memories, for these pre-scientific-age people,were not by-products of neurons firing in a pattern, but were actual visits by thesouls (hugr, hug: ON) of those remembered. With the sighting of the red mottledaurora borealis, memories were of those who had crossed the threshhold from life todeath, particularly as the result of violence. Umo Holmberg writes“During the pagan period, separate worlds for the good and the bad deadwere unknown. But, already at that time, there seem to have been viewsthat the dead attained to different worlds, not on account of their deedsduring life, but according to that which had been the cause of their death.Those who died in battle or as the result of some accident did not go to theunderworld but peopled another world up in the heavens. . . . According tothe Finnish Lapps the aurora borealis is ‘the dead in battle, who, as spiritsstill continue battling with one another in the air.”17He further adds that“to the same folk belief may ultimately be traced the Scandinavian beliefin Valhall, where the souls of the dead in battle dwell, and, according toGylfaginning,’take on their accoutrements, go out into the yard and fightand kill one another’.”18Looking more closely at the sky-gate formed by the forked end of the Milky Way, theancients noticed one side “seemed” to lead upward and the other down. Accordingto ancient folklore and even some of the more modern, there appears to have been atradition of two bridges to the otherworld, one leading to the fighting fields formingthe entire north end of the sky, and the other to the more peaceful landscape of theLands Below.17InFinno-Ugric Mythologyby Umo Holmberg inMythology of All Racesed. by J.

Theway to the Land Beyond certainly involved some dangers as in trying to cross a hugeriver on an old swaying bridge.No one can say with any degree of certainty that early Scandinavians thoughtin these images, but scholars are certain that these were exactly the images used bytribes immediately to the North, East, and West of the homeland of the Germanicrealm up to the middle of the last century, and even as late as 1995 in some of themore rural areas. It would seem very peculiar indeed if the ancient Scandinavianshad held a completely different set of beliefs.There seems to be substance to Jan deVries’ argument that Bifröst, the Shim-mering Way, may be seen in the Milky Way. The first part of the name, accordingto Simek, seems to mean “swaying” rather than “shimmering” from the ONbifato“shake” or “sway”which is exactly what the Milky Way appears to do as it rotatesaround the sky every night. In the night sky, then, the Road to Hel or Ásgard inits N-S orientation could be seen every night, but only at Yule did this orientationcoincide with midnight.The Teutonic heavens were, of course, supported by the branches of the WorldTree. Nowadays, Lærað is conceptualized as little more than a chart with circlesand lines with nine worlds symmetrically spaced throughout the whole thing. It isdoubtful, however, that the ancients thought of the universe in such terms. In fact,it not even clear if they really even understood how to create maps, never mindcharts and diagrams! If that were in their repertoire of skills surely there would beat least one type of pictograph which would represent the universe, but to date nonehave been found which would suggest such an arrangement of worlds although thereare glyphs which suggest the Tree itself.19With a neat application of Occam’s Razor, one is returned to a simple picturewhich the Germanic peoples could easily have seen as the physical arrangementof the universe: a green Earth covered partially by wide expanses of ocean, a sky19Some writers such as Edred Thorsson and Nigel Pennick show a particular glyph whichlooks similar to two ”Y’s,” one right-side up and the other upside down, superimposed upon oneanother so that there is three branches going up and three going down. The upper branches arethe branches of Lærað, and the lower ones are the roots.

Descriptions in Scandinavian literature do not tell usthat the Pole-Star represents the upper end of the World Tree,20but they showit to be the apex of the bowl-shaped sky. It also known from northern Europeanfolk culture that it was the primary reference point in the sky from which all othermovements were reckoned and compared to stationary geographical locations suchas mountains, local trees, house orientations, etc. In other words, as the stars movedaround the Pole-Star, the amount of movement could be easily visualized by how farthey moved in relation to the “stationary” earth-bound objects. But, it is the Samíto the north end of Scandinavia, and their eastern neighbors, the Finns, who haveremembered that the Nail (as they also call it) is the apex of Yggdrasil and it wouldbe well to note that the apex is slightly to the North (hence the term North Star).This concept is relatively common to rural folk throughout the entire circumpolarregion from the Baltic sea to the Aleutians; it may even have been common enoughthat it was not worth mentioning in heroic poetry or family sagas, since the mainthrust of such literature was to leave a record of either Gods or mennotto createa forerunner to the Duden “Picture Dictionary” of Life in the Viking Age.Doing away with all the modern low-charts and mathematical diagrams, thepicture of the universe becomes much simpler and clearer: a disk of the Earth, oneside being the World of the Living, the other, the Land of the Dead; a stationarysky much like a glass cover over a cheese plate; the land-sky connection, Lærað, inthe middle of it all holding all life within it. There are also two other connectionsbetween the plate and the glass cover which are not stationary, but move accordingto the time of day or the season: the Rainbow-Bridge or the “Brig o’ Dread,” andthe Bridge of the Night, the Shimmering Way, Bifröst. In both cases of the land-skybridges (they could have been the same bridge seen as the Milky Way at nightand the rainbow by day), the ends connect to points where sky meets earth, thehorizon, and the center rises up into the sky passing through the upper branches ofthe World Tree. This is a very simple arrangement compared to the many othersfloating around out there. Such an arrangement also matches up to most othertribal systems of the subarctic, both European and Asian, as well as many in themore temperate areas, for defining the cosmos. Is it too simple? After all didn’t theVölva in Völuspá mention that she rememberednineworlds not just three as thesystem here would imply?

The Sky Connection103Otherworld has a very real existence in some other parallel dimension or plane ofexistence, it is doubtful that northern Europeans thought about the reality of theLand of the Ancestors in terms of worlds lying truly separated from Midgard bydimensions of time and space. Pseudo-scientific explanations are usually offered bypeople trying to lend some credibility to faulty arguments. The Otherworld wassimplyherebut invisible, or under the earth/ up in the sky.On the other hand, people who really do have something to offer will often relyon metaphors based in current technology, mainly, because people tend to explainthe unknown or the difficult-to-explain with terms that both the explainer andthe listener will recognize and understand. Neuroscience in the latter half of the19th century explained the function of the human body in the simple “mechanical/clock-terms” of Newtonian physics, within 30 years, the explanations from classicalphysics gave way to the newer concepts from radio electronics, then it was psychol-ogy, and now, computers.Following this argument back into time, the technology of northern Europeansof 1000 years ago revolved around blacksmithing, farming/ herding, and trading/traveling/ raiding (sailing). The world was concrete, not abstract math. These peo-ple knew of other lands or countries on Midgard. They also described lands outsidethe realms of man (but not necessarily separated physically from the earth), suchas floating islands like Svínoy, or invisible or underground cities, towns and home-steads. They understood well the idea of different tribes, cultures, and boundarylines, but in none of their descriptions is there anything like worlds separated, trulyseparated, from the World of Man; Álfheim, Ásgard, Vanaheim can all be interpreted(using eddaic poetry) as contiguous with Mannheim. Travel back and forth throughMidgard world was common and had nothing to do with careening through emptyspace or hyper-jumping over dimensions of time and space and travel between thisworld and the Otherworld, though not quite as common (the stuff legends are madeout of), did not require warp-drive.The word “heim,” according toGlossary to the Poetic Edda, in its primarydefinition is ”1) settlement, farm or farms; place of residence;”21as 3rdand 4thdefinitions the meaning changes slightly to the “whole world.” However, there isno real implication that anything is ever meant beyond the idea of an inhabitedregion enclosed by some sort of boundaries. The word “land” carried more of themeaning of “a country,” and the word “ver old” carried the meaning of “world” or“universe.” The terms “Vanaheim,” “Ljósálfheim,” “Svartálfheim,” “Helheim,” “Nifl-heim,” “Muspelheim,” and “Jötunheim” all implied then the residence of . . .

Some worlds like the floatingisles, or Vanaheim, for that matter, could be glimpsed only periodically or only bypeople with the “second sight” but the general direction of where the land lay wasknown, the effects of the “home” could be felt, such as the spring winds flowing out ofJötunheim, and travellers from these lands, or homesteads, could be spotted eitherin person or by their deeds. Rocks were moved, rivers changed course their courses,lakes were formed. Where do the winds originate if not in the Utlands? It appearsthat none of the “heims” were thought to be truly disconnected from Midgard.All these measurements, configurations, and orientations of the Milky Way areformidnighton specific nights of the year, and although it is well documented thatthe Germanic peoples measured time by “nights” rather than days, is it reasonableto suggest that they would have known exactly when 12:00 am occurred since clockswould not be invented and in common use until 500 years after the invasion ofChristianity? Probably not. However, exact knowledge of hours and minutes is notreally necessary. Observations of the Milky Way and its orientation in the night skypoint up the fact that the Bridge of the Night Sky appears most solid in its N-S(the “split of the fork” touching the northern horizon) orientation and appears tobe fluid in its S-N orientation. The time of year in the far North when the bridgecan be observed in its “solid” state for the highest number of hours, of course, isaround Yule when there is no sun at all (above the Arctic Circle). The amountof time spent insolid formcontinues to increase from when the forked end of theMilky Way “rises” in the East and “sets” in the West which occurs during the ancientseason of winter, mid-October to mid-April, with its high-point around Yule, thetime of no sun. During summer, there is no problem with the reckoning of midnightsince the amount of time spent in actual darkness is minimal.All the evidence presented thus far would make it seem that the Milky Way, inparticular, and the night sky, in general, probably played a large role in the formationof the Germanic worldview with the sky being the top of the World Tree and theMilky Way being the Path of Souls lining up with the gate to the underworld onceevery 24 hours. The probability of this being fact is increased when one includescollected evidence taken from modern Scandinavian folklore and that from tribes22Saxo Grammaticus’Gesta DanoremorHistory of the Daneshas been translated severaltimes. The work, as translated, generally consists of nine books and was written in approximately1215 CE. The author is decidedly pro-Danish and anti-Heathen. The accuracy of the mythologicalmaterial upon which theGesta Danoremis based has been rather hotly debated over the years.For the purposes of this book, this author has chosen not to join the fray but simply regards thematerial for what it is, i.e., northern mythology recorded by a staunch anti-Heathen of the 13thcentury."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. The Sky Connection105of non-Germanic people living immediately to the north (Saamí) and to the east(Finns, and various small tribes living just east of the Ural Mountains). However,direct evidence is sorely lacking.By the time that the Germanic peoples had moved into the historic era and hadcommitted their own beliefs to parchment, many changes had taken place which werethe result of foreign influences being brought in by the Church and by importationsmade by the Vikings themselves who traveled extensively between the years of 700CE to 1100 CE. What is missing from the body of evidence is clear information thatthe Celtic peoples, who also had a fairly large body of lore pertaining to the nightsky, also understood the role of the Milky Way. Also lacking are vestiges of this folkbelief in modern Scandinavian folklore although it still exists in Saamí folklore. As aconsequence, the above information can only be presented as a series of coincidenceswith some degree of probability of it being fact.During the last century and continuing through the 20th century, there has beena move to reduce all religions in their “reconstructed form” to sun-moon worship. Thetheory was made popular with the publishing on Frazer’sThe Golden Bough23andhas been used as the basis for interpretation since that time. Storms inAnglo-SaxonMagic, 1948, was also caught up in this theory when attempting to interpret theAnglo-Saxon charms from the manuscript called theLacnunga; however, eddaicliterature relegates both the sun and the moon to demi-Gods who play only a minorrole during the creation of the World Tree and, according to the Völuspá, at theend of the World, the Ragnarök.Although the sun (ONSunna= a Goddess) and the moon (ONMaani; Máni=a God) were described in the eddaic poetry, complete with their lineages and their ̧orlög, there is no indication that they have ever been worshipped as anything butminor demi-gods and markers of the passage of time. In the Norse mythology as itexists today, these two were destined to be chased across the sky by the wolvesSköllandHatiuntil the final battle when they will be killed and devoured. There is muchfolklore and folkscience pertaining to the two in their roles as “markers of time,” andthis is discussed quite in depth by O. S. Reuter inGermanische Himmelskunde(Germanic Skylore), but even in the Anglo-Saxon charms they do not play as largea role as many wishful modern scholars would like.As stated earlier, astrology only began to appear in the north in conjunctionwith ancient medicine after the Roman and Christian invasions. Prior to that, itappears medicinal herbs were picked according to their own timing and ripeness withtwilight and dawn being the most propitious times, according to common folklore,because “the sky was lit, but there were no lights in the sky;” it was an “in-between23Frazer, Sir James G.The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion.MacMillanPublishing Co., Inc., New York, 1963."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Chapter 4.

Such “cracks” are commonin Germanic folk medicine and folk magic, such as making magic on the sand at apoint in between the levels of the tide or in a cave.24This concept continues to figurein modern native herbalism of northern Europe and will be discussed at length inlater chapters.The eddaic and sagaic writings do not contain anything directly pertaining tothe “lights of the sky,” but there is much in Finnish, Saamí, and modern (germanic)Scandinavian folk lore mostly revolving around the idea that the aurora borealis was“souls” flying to the Otherworld, and that the reddish hues often seen were bloodybattles either between warriors ornoaides(shamans).25There is a body of folklore,particularly among the Scandinavian Lapps (Saamí), and in modern northern Ger-manic folklore which at least concerns the phases of the moon for operations such asblood-letting, slaughtering animals, planting, harvesting, other farm chores, building24InThe Folklore of Orkney and Shetlandby Ernest Marwick (Rowman and Littlefield, NewJersey ) pp. 48-52, 1975.25There is a body of lore among the Saamí describing the ”fire Lapps,” but unfortunately,not much of this has been translated into English. The term ”fire Lapp” refers to thenoaideas hebattles other shamans, and the fire refers specifically to either the ”will-o’the-wisp (doubtful) orthe aurora borealis (most probable)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. The Sky Connection107, etc. However, from the information as it exists today, it is very difficult to tellwhat came from foreign sources, and what was only native knowledge to particularpeoples such as the Saamí, the Celts, or the Finno-Ugric subgroups. Many of thesecustoms deal with the moon as a primary temporal indicator for activities, and thisis congruent with the idea that the ancient Germanic peoples marked time by nightsand the moon as discussed above. Tacitus, inGermania, (cited earlier) records thatimportant activities took place according to the phases of the moon. It is likely thenthat the moon continued to play a large role in early Germanic culture.Additionally, given the diversity of local customs pertaining to the moon, severalother theories can be postulated.1. The moon as a marker of time for specific events was most likely widely accepted.a) The moon as a component in the making of charms, medicine, orseiðr(Ger-manic oracle/ magic with many shamanistic overtones) probably played arole since these operations were often done at night.i. The waxing moon generally dealt with operations requiring an increase(cutting hair, marriages, building, etc.);ii. the full moon for operations being done at “full maturity (cutting hay,chopping wood, etc);iii. the waning moon for decrease (making medicines to rid pestilence, etc.).26b) Sets of customs or interactions with the moon may have varied from villageto village or may have been familial or personal rather than pervasive.c) The customs may have varied easily over time depending on outside influ-ences, exchange of information between communities, etc.Holmberg inFinno-Ugric Mythologyand Hazlitt inFaiths and Folklore of the BritishIsles27give numerous examples of lunar knowledge as it existed between approxi-mately 1600 - 1900 CE, but very little can be said regarding the origins of thebeliefs, i.e., whether they were from foreign sources. The fact, though, that piecesof lunar knowledge were accepted easily indicates that lunar knowledge was mostlikely part of the Germanic worldview in some form or another, and it was feltthat the information “needed updating” regularly; it was most likely not part of thegeneral religious complex which tend to be more conservative in nature.Solar folklore is even more scanty in the Germanic culture, even though the Sunwas extremely important to the Samí and Finns, and as a Goddess or sometimes aGod, appears in many of their legends of folk cosmology. The sun for the Germanicfolk was considered to be feminine and still is in modern German (die Sonne), mayhave had oaths sworn to Her (or She functioned as a “witness”), and was greeted26See Grimm pp. 707-719.27Hazlitt, W.

Thisargument is supported by the idea that the eyes are the “lights of the head” andthis kenning continues to be used in modern English in the phrase, “knock one’sdaylights out!” Whatever place the sun may have held in the minds of the ancientfolk, it must have been relatively important to command bowing with bared headby the peasantry. Perhaps, as with the Saamí, She was held in a constant state ofreverence as the “Bringer of Warmth.”Lastly, the sky seems to have been the window through which the ancient Ger-mans and Scandinavians could view the effects of the otherworld upon Midgard.The sky held the Road of the Dead which ran over the apex of the World Tree andit was the screen against which played omens from both the Gods of the air, theÆsir, and the Ancestors. It was a physical, visual and constant reminder that theOtherworld was a reality, and was the link between this world and the next. Omens(ONheill= “portent or omen”) came in the form of birds’ flight patterns, shootingstars or comets, aurora borealis, or visions and were regarded as one of the bestforms of prognostication, pieces of which can be gleaned from the sagaic literatureand the heroic poetry.In spite of the fact that omens were definitely important to the ancients, theirinterpretation seems to have been by consensus of the community or, perhaps, indi-vidual. Perusal of the entire body of northern European folklore reveals that whatwas considered a “good omen” for one locality was interpreted as an “evil portent” foranother although there did seem to be general consensus that “red lights” in the skyor “a comet” were held to portend evil times ahead. Because of this inconsistency,any attempt to “recreate” a system of divination based on sky omens would bemeaningless.That the sky held a special place in the pre-Christian Germanic worldview isobvious, but how consistent that role was may never be discovered. In the view ofthe World Tree complex, it represented the apex of the Tree and was home to theRoad of the Dead which terminated at the gate to the underworld. Movements oflights in the sky-world marked the passage of time and presented to the inhabitantsof northern Europe indications for the correct timing of schedules pertaining towork and leisure, and individual or community activities, but unlike the cultures ofthe more southerly countries no indigenous form or system of astrology has beendiscovered. The sky itself was a visual link between the Land of the Living andthe otherworld lying above Midgard like a large sheet against which played visualmessages, omens and portents for those who knew how to see them and interpret28See Grimm pp. 700-706."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Chapter 4.

Beyond the sky’s being a link to the otherworld very little can be saidregarding any system of skylore which would cross cultural or spatial boundaries.The sky, as can be seen from Midgard, was part of the world of man.

If a gloomy life-after-death were all the tradition had to offer,it most likely would have been dropped from folk memory long ago; however, ithassurvived, and, if probed deeply enough, the Underworld of the ancients yields forthvast treasures which forms the very foundation of many ancient and modern folktraditions and holidays.Germanic tradition apparently did not depict the Underworld as simply theLand of the Ancestors but held that it was already populated by various races in amanner similar to the Celtic belief system. The Underworld was home to Giants,Elves, Gods, and a variety of otherworldly beings both beneficent and malicious.Although the ancient Germanic religion was officially laid to rest by approximately1200 CE, the beings of the Underworld tradition continued to play a large role in theso-called “fairy-tale literature.” This genre of literature, however, was originally notmeant as moralistic teachings for children, as is generally now the case, but was anintegral part of folk-culture dealing with life in rural areas and had much to do withthe oral transmission of information pertaining to farming, fishing, hunting, birth,healing, and death. Folklore was the “science” of the rural north, and fairy-taleswere the “science fiction.”Christians have an interesting way of handling the concepts of death and lifethereafter. Originally , in the Old Testament, there was an Underworld called Sheolor Gehenna. Without belaboring the point, Sheol or Gehenna (both mean basicallythe same) was a place where souls went after leaving the jewish version of Midgard.There were apparently no other places like Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory as thereare now in some branches of modern Christianity. About the time when Jesus issupposed to have walked the earth, there began a change in the way of thinkingabout the afterlife so that souls would no longer be loosed into an Underworld butwould return to Eden or Paradise, later called “Heaven” (from OE pl.heofenum= “heavens”); however, those gates were closed to any but of the line of Abraham.People from other cultures obviously experienced death, but by jewish proscriptionwere not to be allowed within the Gates of Paradise which was reserved for jewsonly. They had to go some place else, which from the jewish point of view of thetime, must have beensomewhat less than. The Underworld, Gehenna, (now emptiedof the Heaven-bound jews) fit that description in the Abrahamic cosmology–the newhome of the gentile dead.When Christians (a modified version of the the Judaism) began their all outeffort to redeem the northern world around 600 CE, the Underworld became arhetorical weapon for convincing the Heathen. By this time, demons, and all otherspooky critters which gave any good Christian the chills were also relegated to the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld112Underworld which they now called Hell after the northern Goddess of the Land ofthe Dead, Hel or Hela (ONHel). The list included not only Satan, Beelzebub, et al.but also heathen gods, demi-gods, and non-organic beings from all other culturesas well. Óðínn, Þór, and Saxnot were all dumped into the Underworld part ofwhich was called Helheim or the Home of Hel. Really, within the Christian logicof the time, this was not a bad line of reasoning. Heathens, unless baptized andaccepting of Jesus as their Savior, were doomed to the demon-filled Halls of Hel,which was “downwards,” and the good, properly baptized Christians were “deckedout” for Paradise which was by the same line of reasoning “upwards.” After theconversion of heathens to Christianity, the concept of “down” was considered bad,and “up” was associated with good.The northern concept of the Underworld was not always viewed negatively. Thestory of Frau Holle which is a common childhood story presents a view of an Un-derworld with two distinct sides to it. Granted, this is one of those “moral” storiesmentioned above about why it is such a good idea to do chores without complaining,but the visual images are quite interesting. First, it is a pleasantly lit land in contrastto the dreary picture one gets from the eddaic or sagaic writings. It does not lackfor food, light or comfort. There are fully leaved trees, blooming flowers, and wateraplenty. Similarly, but in a completely different tale describing a chieftain’s funeralamong the Rus1, Ibn Fadlan records a slave girl’s visions after peering into the Oth-erworld: “I see my master seated in Paradise, and Paradise is green and fair. . . .”2In fact, the Otherworld appears to be a mirror image of Midgard. Secondly, whatoccurs in the Underworld of Frau Holle has a direct impact on Midgard; both sistersare told to fluff the pillows until the feathers fly so that snow might cover the Earth.Thirdly, how the children behaved in the Underworld resulted in either fortune orfailure upon their return to their Middle-earth home.Actually, this concept of an Underworld having both dark and light sides seems tosurvive in a collective/ cultural memory of people with a Germanic/ Celtic ancestry.Baum’sThe Wizard of Ozis a modern tale which, although written mainly forchildren, has delighted both children and adults since it was written in the late1800’s. Oz exists “somewhere over the rainbow” which is highly reminiscent of the1The Rus were an Eastern branch of Scandinavians living in what is now called Finland andWestern Russia. It is their name (which is related to the word for ”red”) which gave Russia itsname.2Turville-Petre,Myth and Religion of the North,p. 273. Actually, Michael Crichton wrote afictional account of this story calledThe Eaters of the Deadwhich is quite pleasant to read. Hisversion is based on translations of several existing manuscripts of the Ibn Fadlan account whichCrichton is very careful to mention in his Afterword."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld113“brig o’ dread, na brader than a thread”3or the rainbow bridge Bifröst. The Landof Oz has both bright and dark aspects as well as good and evil. In Oz, the good isexemplified by Glenda the Witch of the North, and evil by the Witches of the Eastand West. In the eddaic literature, however, all these are combined in the two-sidedGoddess, Hel, whose face is half beautiful and half in decay. It is not known whetherBaum was drawing directly from Germanic mythology or not, but it can be surmisedthat he drew from his imagination and memory of childhood stories which oftenare but the surface structure of the collective/ cultural eduacation through oraltradition.On the one hand, these descriptions can be merely written off as a storyteller’sfanciful imagination; on the other, however, the tale weaver may have been recantingthe living oral tradition of his ancestry. With a little investigation into the folkmemories of cultures bordering the Germanic peoples such as the Finns, the Saamí,the Celts, and the Balts, one finds that the storyteller’s memory might even run alittle deeper than simply Old Norse, perhaps a Northern European–subarctic culture.For some, comparative mythology is truly a source of contention, and, in manycases, contention may be justified. Comparing North American mythology withGermanic (as is often done among New Age folk) is truly mixing apples and orangesexcept at a very broad and general level, but comparisons should not be completelydisregarded. While it is true that linguistically Finnish is non Indo-European, CelticisIndo-European having branched off the proto-Germanic line approximately 1000years earlier, Baltic appears to stem from a completely different line of Indo-Europeanand the Saamí language (Lappish) is a mixture of the languages of the indigenouspeople of Northern Europe, Finnish, and Swedish, and that all these languages differfrom one another greatly, the speakers of these different tongues demonstrate manycultural commonalities. True, each culture considers itself to be an autonomousethnic entity, but each is in a great part defined by geographic location, and geog-raphy, weather patterns, availability of and types of food, occupations determinedby the land, and cultural intercourse helped to create large border areas around theNorthern Germanic peoples where the distinguishing characteristics of one cultureblurred into the next often making it difficult for even the inhabitants of the regionitself to form any true alliance with either one culture or the other.These border zones become important, then, for the purposes of comparison.To ignore the similarities between these cultures, especially within the border-zoneregions themselves, would either have to be an act of prejudice based on somesilly notion of racial, religious, or cultural purity, or simple ignorance.

The Underworld114Teutons obviously were able to withhold their prejudices long enough to create theborder regions through both cultural and sexual intercourse in the first place!Trade, migration, and inter-marriage played a large role in the creation andmaintenance of these border areas. H. R. , in her conclusion toLost Beliefs ofNorthern Europepoints out that“once we reach the Viking Age, we have also to be prepared for tales andmotifs from abroad being imported by the Scandinavians returning from theirtravels to their homelands.”4One also needs to remember that while these importations seemed to be acceptedrather freely, they were accepted for two reasons:1. they were not felt to be necessarily incompatible with the existing beliefs of thetime, and2. they were most likely modified, or were at least modifiable, to fit into the currentprevailing worldview.One need only look at the changes made in Christianity after it arrived in the Northto see that even a conservative religion/ culture can and will be modified afterencountering another culture. (Note: the reader is referred to the section belowdealing with the creation of modern Christian holidays and holiday customs.)An interesting feature of border areas is that they tend to be in isolated areas,andisolationoften is concomitant withconservatism, a resistance to change. Thus,in Switzerland, for example, the regional dialects spoken in many of the valleys is aform of archaic southern German which disappeared in other areas 500 years ago,and in New Mexico, in the southwest corner of the United States, the dialect ofSpanish spoken is very closely related to that spoken in medieval Spain coming tothe continent in the early 1500’s with the conquistadors.In any nook of preserved tradition, the modern anthropologist or folklorist ishappy to find remnants of ancient cultures like rites of passage, food customs, andmagic related to hunting, occupation, marriage, and disease. For example, it is verycommon, not only in Northern Europe, to find a flourishing set of traditions revolvingaround the indigenous form of witchcraft (here in the anthropological sense, notthe New Age Wiccan) which is commonly applied to help family and friends andalso to harm enemies. These isolated areas have resisted changes brought by theearly Christian missionaries and the cultural legacies continue to this day so thatthe Shetland and Orkneys, and the lives of folks in the northern zones of Norway,Sweden, and Finland are still often controlled or manipulated to a great degree by4Ellis-Davidson, H.

But becauseborder zonesare being dealt withhere, the very nature of which is the blending of two or more cultures, care mustbe taken that one does not begin to believe that a culture is being observed in its“original form.”“When we survey the possible complications and varied influences whichcould have affected pre-Christian religion in Northern Europe, it is evidentthat such ‘scientific proof’ as Strenski desired in his criticism of the theoriesof Eliade is hardly possible to provide. Nor is it possible to reach firm con-clusions as to the religious beliefs and myths of the Indo-European peoplesfrom whom the Celts and Germans are descended.”5In spite of the “isolation = conservatism” theory, one must take some precautionsbecause changeshaveoccurred over the centuries, and it is usually not clear as towhat is original (if the term can be truly applied at all) and what is “imported.”The complex and pervasive nature of the entire Underworld in the Germanicworldview is not clearly depicted in the eddaic or sagaic writings. Studies of commonfolklore in Northern Europe indicate that knowledge of an Underworld formed anunderlying foundation to much of the belief system but did not necessarily stand outin detail. For the Northern European, the land seems to have been divided into atleast two parts. For the Germanic peoples, Helheim was the term usually reservedfor the Land of the Ancestors or the Land of the Dead, which was ruled over bythe female offspring of Loki, Hel; however, other parts of folk tradition in the Northsuggest that the Underworld was also considered home toálfar(elves), dwarves,some giants, theDísir(sing.dís; ‘a female demi-god’), and a few other assortedbeings who may also have been closely bound up with the tradition. Turville-PetreinMyth and Religion of the Northhas presented a fairly convincing position thatboth the álfar and the Dísir belong to the Land of the Dead.6This position is echoedby other scholars as well.In addition to these beings, there are numerous examples of guardian spiritsattached to certain families often going by the generic terms ofKynfylgja,fylgja,orhamingja(usually associated with luck), but also by the name of Elf (in the caseof amale guardian), such as the “Elf of Geirstad,” or simply Dís (in the case of afemale). From these descriptions it is difficult to determine, at least by the general5Ellis-Davidson, 1993, p. 159.6See Turville-Petre, E. O.

The Underworld117reader, whether these familial guardians are actually ancestors who have taken upa new role as family protector or whether they actually constitute a distinct raceunder a single generic name. Davidson is describing this same problem when shediscusses the fisherman, Þorolf, buried near Helgafell:“Helgafell is not unlike a large burial mound, and here we may have atransference of beliefs about dead leaders in their great mounds in Scandi-navia who brought blessing to the land when they were laid to rest in theirgraves. Snorri inYnglinga Sagatraces such beliefs back to the god Freyr,who once ruled over the Swedes at Uppsala and had his chief temple there.He is said to have brought good seasons and prosperity to the land, and sowhen he died, the Swedes brought great offerings to his mound, and believedthat he remained alive and potent in the earth. The connection which seemsto exist between Freyr and the elves and the land-spirits thus provides anadditional reason to associate them with the dead in their graves.”7When one looks to neighboring cultures for possible clarification, the problem re-mains. For example, no one is quite sure if thesidheconstituted a distinct raceof people who inhabited Eire (modern Ireland) prior to the coming of the currentinhabitants or if the race of thesidheconsidered to continue growing even in moderntimes because some of those who die from Earth are taken into the Blessed Land.In other words, it is difficult to tell if souls after death were understood to haveconstituted a “new tribe” or somehow have changed status. A similar blurry distinc-tion exists among the Scandinavian Lapps, the Finnish Lapps, and the Finno-Ugricpeoples proper.Perhaps, there is a parallel to the problem which, although not offering anyreal explanation, will make the ambiguity at least somewhat tolerable. The ancientNorthern Europeans were well aware that Midgard was comprised of several differentraces, cultures, and religions which moved around, intermingled, and overlapped tosome degree depending on geographic location. People south of what is now modernGermany had darker hair and skin than the northern peoples, Celts were tall, theSaamí were short and dark as were the Greenland Eskimo, etc. This does not reallypresent a problem to the modern way of thinking until somebody tries to figure outwho the indigenous people of France were, for example. If Midgard and Helheimwere understood to reflect one another in structure, then it might also be assumedthat tribes of beings living in the netherworld were as capable of migration andintermixing, trading, marrying, feasting and visiting as were their counterparts inMannheim, and remnants in Northern European folklore including Celtic, Germanic,and Finno-Ugric would indicate that this certainly was the prevailing belief.7H.

The Underworld118When Christianity came into Northern Europe, the idea that the Afterlife asastate of perpetual stasisseems to have come with it. The image of Paradise (orHell) as a resting place for all eternity replaced the many of the older beliefs of lifeafter death, and this concept of “Rest in Peace” continues into the 20thCentury.The Christian assumption is that once something enters into the Underworld, itsevolution stops, but, for the Scandinavian of a thousand years ago, the after-deathprogression in status of a local hero to that of a family protector, then continuing toincrease in status up to demi-god for the northern peoples was not that uncommon.Bard of Snæfell, Þorolf (mentioned above), and the “Elf” of Geirstad are examples ofthis elevation in status after death from local leader to guardian, and to these localdemi-gods sacrifices were offered on a regular basis. This very same mechanism forelevating status after death continued even after the introduction of Christianity tothe Scandinavian countries, so that Scandinavia itself possessed more local saintsper capita (unrecognized by the Vatican) than any other area of the world. Davidsongoes on to say“Evidently the conception of land-spirits linked with the dead within theearth was a persistent one, although it remains vague and unspecified in theliterary sources. Belief in the potency of such spirits to help or hinder menand women in their daily lives on the farms, and to unite with the king tobring blessing to the community was something difficult to eradicate. Theevidence of folklore makes it clear that it lived on in local legends long afterthe coming of Christianity, and it survives in vigorous folktales and rhymeswhich can still stir our imagination . . . . Cultivation of the soil, weaving andspinning, and the raising of animals all fell into the province of the naturespirits, and so apparently did the destiny and upbringing of children.”8Although nothing is solved as far as the nature of the Underworld is concerned, atleast the idea that it is as dynamic as Midgard offers some rationale for there beingso many variations in traditions revolving around death, burial, and beliefs in anAfterlife.For all the northern cultures concerned here, there appears to be a commontheme regarding the Underworld. Umo Holmberg says that “in its nature this Un-derworld resembles the world we live in everything.”9Later, he goes on to describethat it is a belief of the eastern Europeans that the dead live in villages below theearth and that these villages are comprised of the same people who lived togetherduring life. Granted he is talking about the Finno-Ugric people, but inThe Se-8op. cit., pp. 132-133.9Holmberg, UmoFinno-Ugric Mythology, inMythology of all Racesed. by John MacCulloch(Boston, Mass)1928, p. 72-82."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld119cret Commonwealth, Robert Kirk, a Scottish clergyman, describes exactly the samesituations for the inhabitants of the Scottish Underworld:“Their apparel and speech is like that of the people and country underwhich they live . . . . Their women are said to spin, very finely, to dye, totissue, and to embroider . . . ”10Here Kirk is talking about the land where thesidheand the co-walkers live, co-walkersbeing the equivalent of an Underworld doppelgänger which is intimately attachedto a person who still lives. Of course, the story of Frau Holle was mentioned earlierwherein bread was baked, beds were made and houses were in need of daily cleaning.All the northern non-Christian cultures (and even some of the Christian ones) seemto agree that life in the Underworld is no different than life on Midgard.Burial goods found in the Northern European countries would also indicate thatlife below was expected to be the same as above. Women have been found buriedwith household items such as combs, spindles, needles and needle-cases, cookingpots and utensils, even a supply of food. Men are found buried with those itemswhich were pertinent to their station in life, even to the point that kings wereburied with riches so, presumedly, they could continue playing the role of leader and“gold-hater” or “ring-giver”11as in kennings provided by Snorri. Logically, it wasexpected that the dead would continue with their activities of daily living just asthey had done while alive. Some burial goods have been found in a damaged state.For example, pots have been found which have been deliberately broken and swordsor other weapons have been found either bent, broken, or dismantled. It is knownthat in some local regions of the northern cultures that items destined for intermentwith their owner needed to first be “ritually killed.” From an animistic point of viewthis makes good sense since the “soul” of an object could not possibly be releaseduntil its earth-bound form was broken; however, because notallgrave goods aredamaged before burial, this theory can never be said to have been universal amongthe northern peoples. It is most likely related to regional cultural variations, andthe current belief held at the time. Damaged, “killed,” or in their original state,by their presence grave goods which relate to everyday activity indicate knowledgethat life below is a continuation of life above.The Underworld not only seems to reflect the land above seems but appears tobe inextricably tied to it as well. For all the northern peoples concerned here, thoseliving in the Land of the Ancestors reside in the “mountain below the mountain” or10Stewart, Robert J.Robert Kirk: Walker between the World(Element Books; Dorset, GreatBritain) 1990, p. 26.11The reader is referred to Chapter 3 for a discussion of these terms and what they meant tothe Northern Germanic peoples."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld120the “village below the graveyard.” For the Finns, Saamí, Shetlanders, Highlanders(Scotland), and many of the other small, rural Scandinavian districts, the cemeteryor burial place still represents both the “marker” of the Underworld home for thedead and also the “entry place” into the Otherworld (previously Helheim or Hel forthe Scandinavians) for the newly dead. Because of this, there are many precautionsto be taken when in a graveyard so not to “accidentally” bring them back to theLand of the Living as adraugr(ON = “reanimated corpse”).In many districts throughout Northern Europe, regardless of linguistic culture,there are customs surrounding interment which are precautionary in nature so thatthe newly dead will make a “one-way” trip to the graveyard because the soullesscorpse returning to the Land of the Living was considered very real, dangerous anddeadly. In many areas in the North, for example, a body is removed from a housethrough a specially created opening next to a door, between the removed door andthe hinged jamb, or through a “special” window so that when the corpse shoulddecide to return home, it cannot; its return path is blocked by closure. The beliefhere is that the body ordraugr12can only return by the same route by which itwas taken out. Additionally, there are customs dealing with the return of the corpsesuch chopping off the head and placing it between the knees to keep it from walking.All these customs taken together are to bring the dead to the final resting place andto make sure he stays there. The final resting place for the corpse represents thenew “home” in the Underworld and the soul’s starting place for its new life .When customs in Northern Europe pertaining to death and burial are inves-tigated by collecting by ethnologists, comparing both within single cultures andbetween neighboring regions, a hazy, but definite picture of a northern Underworldbegins to emerge which crosses cultural boundaries. The Underworld is similarin many respects to Midgard or the Land of the Living. The inhabitants live invillages and communities comprised of others from the same geographical locationon Midgard or in extended family units below the ancestral burial grounds. Life goeson differing little from the life they had known previously and they engage in thesame daily occupations known to them from above ground. There are others wholive below as well who have never had earthly such as theálfar,Svartálfar(dwarves),giants (jötunar), Æsir, and Vanir. The Underworld really seems to be a continuationof the life lived above ground with certain exceptions. There is intercourse with racesof beings rarely encountered above and with ancestors and friends who had gonebefore, and there are dangers as well as fortune associated with such encounters.12ONdraugr= ”reanimated corpse”often retaining a small amount of the personality ofwho the individual was previously, but which has tremendously increased strength, and is alwaysdangerous to the living except in special cases where the draugr’s killing harming an individualwas taboo, especially in the case of familial relationship."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld121One’s status or occupation after death is also subject to change depending on one’sreputation (fame) at the time of death and the continuing defense of that reputationafter death. And although interaction between the dead and the living is limited,the Underworld is intimately related to Midgard or the Overworld: the two feed oneanother.The ancient Teutonic peoples (as well as the Celts, Balts, Finno-Ugric peoples,etc.) understood well that the Underworld is not somehow separated from the restof the universe, i.e., the Lands with in the Tree, but plays a fundamental role in thewell-being of Lærað, the World Tree. The description of the Tree itself is relativelyunimportant here, but the movement of the Waters is not. According to SnorriSturluson in theGylfaginning, the Waters move from Hvergelmir, the spring in thedepths of the Ginnungagap, out through the eleven streams of the Élivágar andcourse upward through the Tree of the Worlds. The Waters feed all rivers, lakes,springs, wells, and seas of all the Worlds. Indeed, they truly are the source of alllife. They continue their journey until reaching the very top of the Tree where theydrip from the antlers of the four harts which feed on the uppermost buds of Læraðand fall back, some reaching Midgard as the morning dew and, obviously, eventuallyfall back into Hvergelmir completing the cycle. The role of the Underworld by itsvery location in the scheme of things is to distribute those Waters immediately upontheir release from the original Well out into the worlds and to receive the returnflow for funneling back into Hvergelmir.Another part of this intimate relationship between Middle-Earth and the Under-world is the idea of reciprocity. Holmberg describes the Underworld as resembling“the world we live in everything, with the exception that, seen with oureyes, everything there would appear inside out or upside down . . . The samerivers and streams exist there, but flow in opposite directions. The tops ofthe trees there grow downward; the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.”13Ailo Gaup, a Samí multi-media artist andnoaide, stated one time that “our An-cestors walk under the Earth, upside down, with their feet against the soles ofour feet.”14These mirror-images are more difficult to find in the bulk of Scandi-navian literature than in the neighboring cultures except in small pieces here andthere. The Frau Holle story offers some indication that the idea of reciprocity, ormirror-imaging, was not unknown to the early Germanic peoples. The shaking outof the feather bedding, normally done on sunny days, resulted in snow falling on the13op. cit., pp. 72-73.14Personal communication in Oct., 1994, in Albuquerque, NM, during a group discussionabout the Ancestors."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld122earth, and smoke from her fire resulted in fog. (One should take note that smokefrom a fire will only “rise” on clear, cool days which is opposite weather from afoggy day on Midgard.) In Saxo Grammaticus’Gesta Danorum, Hadding is led toa place where “herbs grow in winter.” In some folktales, touching an Underworldbeing with cold iron results in him feeling a burning pain. In other folktales, elves orother Underworld folk complain of starvation when there is an abundance of food onMidgard and vice-versa. Even the Hávamál alludes to the idea of reciprocity whenone is cautioned to observe moderation in everything, which, seems very much out ofplace since the general view of Vikings is that they tended to overindulge in almostevery area of life. Moderation in food and drink, here on Midgard, however, withreciprocity as the rule, meant a similar distribution of food and drink in the Landof the Forefathers. The concept of moderation may have been practiced, then, overthe centuries as part of an all-out effort by individuals or communities to maintain ahealthy give-and-take relationship to the Otherworld. Although mirror-imaging be-tween the Over- and Underworlds is never overtly depicted and only rarely alluded toin the eddaic or sagaic literature, it was definitely not unknown to our well-traveledTeutonic forebears, even if only mentioned lightly or implied in folktales.The way in which the ancient Teutons measured time also provides some in-dications as to how reciprocity may have fit into the overall scheme of things. Itis well attested that the normal unit for measurement of the year by the ancientScandinavians, as well as the Celts, was the half-year.“In Iceland, themesseriwere summer and winter, each season twenty-sixweeks in length, and the beginning of each was marked by feasting and reli-gious ritual. The passage of time was marked by winter and nights.”15The period of time betweenWinternightsandJúl16was especially dangerous forthe Scandinavian forebears as well as for their Celtic cousins since this was the timeof thegandreið, or the “Wild-Hunt,” which, in the Germanic culture, was believedto be Óðínn and a retinue of reckless followers riding across the land. Winternights(approximately mid-October) and Júl (Yule) are both holidays associated with theLand of the Dead and were variously viewed as times to commune with Underworldbeings: ancestors, the álfar, the Dísir, and local guardian/ demi-gods. The periodof time in between these two holidays was the “dangerous time of year when Ghostsride in the “Wild Hunt,” and folks were at risk of being swept up never to return15Ellis-Davidson, H. R.Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe(Syracuse University Press;Syracuse, NY) 1988, p. 37.16In other words, the period of time between October 14 (approximately) and the wintersolstice which were called ”Winternights” and ”Júl” (Yule) respectively. These are two of the ”threeholiday-celebrations” celebrated by the people of the Viking era according to Snorri Sturlason intheHeimskringla."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld123to their Midgard homes, or if they did, their sanity would not come with them.Winternights later became Halloween or “Hallowed Evening,” now, long associatedwith the grave, and Júl became Christmas. Although modern culture does notnormally link the latter with a Feast for the Dead, modern Saamí as well as manyScandinavians continue the older belief that it is the night when “the Dead walk” andstill consider Christmas Eve to be ”the most dangerous evening” of the year.17Forthose living on Middle-earth, winter was the time of rest and travel was kept to anextreme minimum out of necessity due to severe weather conditions and the hazardsof travel by either foot or horseback, but for the teeming dead it was “summer,” whenactivity level was at its peak, the time of travel.The period between mid-October and mid-January was important to the Ger-manic peoples for a variety of reasons. In the rural community, it was the time whenthe final harvests were put into storage, when animals were butchered and the meatwas prepared and hung. Life and activity within the home increased; weaving newcloth and the mending of winter clothes were common daily activities along withmaking ready for the upcoming festive holidays.For these people, the winter festivals were the high points of the year.“They met to renew their contract with the supernatural world, and toensure luck for the coming season, and this was something for the wholecommunity to share in not just selected guests.”18Luck and prosperity were brought forth from the Underworld through proper obser-vance of ritual during the winter months so they could be enjoyed throughout thesummer, only to have a part of the harvest returned back to the Land of the Dead atthe turning of the year at Winternights to start the cycle anew. Reciprocity, a cycleof give-and-take, for the ancients was the concept of the Underworld feeding intoMiddle-earth, and Middle-earth then feeding back into the Underworld in a neverending circle of events periodically marked by holidays.Holidays were the temporal markers of the cycle of the ancient year, but it wasnecessary for these events to be combined with physical-spatial markers as well. Thelocal graveyard was a family’s link to the Underworld. For luck, ancestors were keptplacated through sacrifice on certain holidays particularly during the winter monthswhen the spirits of the dead were most active, and these sacrifices were placed withinboth temporal and physical frameworks. Often these annual celebrations, or at leastpart of them, were carried out near or in cemeteries, burial mounds, etc. There aremany folktales which tell of aspiring poets or musicians who go to the graves of“past-masters” on these nights when the temporal-spatial doorways stood ajar, and17Holmberg,Finno-Ugric Mythology, p. 66.18Ellis-Davidson,Myth and Symbol in Pagan Europe, 1988, p. 40."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld124occasionally, there is the tale of the young heir who goes to the ancestral gravemound at Yule to retrieve the familial sword. Indeed, for many cultures includingthe Germanic, graveyards were very important and were well kept not solely for thepurpose of giving the corpse a “pretty place” to lie but because it was the link of thecommunity to the Underworld and the place from which the Waters of Life couldpour forth. By caring for the locale where the dead lay, the living could be assuredof help from below.That the barrow, i.e., family graveyard, was considered to be the home of ances-tors is well attested. Folklore from over the entire north relates stories concerning afamily member wandering near a new grave and seeing a newly dead family memberamong his or her relatives enjoying life after life. Cults of the dead or of ancestorworship were also very common in Northern Europe primarily at a local level. Deadgrandparents watched over the family homestead, the crops, or the livestock. AScandinavian rite calledútiseta(literally “sitting out”) involved sleeping on the burialmound of a dead ancestor for inspiration such as the aspiring poet did as reported intheFlateyjárbók, for example. One of the old English charms for preventing miscar-riage required the pregnant wife to step over the grave of a “dead man” presumedlybecause he had an intimate link with the Otherworld and, therefore, could intercedeon the part of the unborn child. Although not clearly spelled out in the charm,thegravecould very well have been that of a relative. Naming children after newlydead or famous ancestors was also a way of gaining the protection of that ancestorfor the child by providing the child with an Underworld connection, a linguistic linkto the Land of the Dead. A belt was removed from the howe of Ólaf (the “Elf”) ofGeirstad to be used in the birthing of a child most likely to gain the protection ofthis ancestor. The family graveyard was indeed a sacred place, an opening throughwhich luck/ power could flow into the community.During the Heathen period in the North, there does not appear to have beenany differences in where a person ”went” after death. In fact, it seems that everyoneprobably went to the same general place. In modern times the deciding factor ina soul’s final destination is a man’s “good works”: one either goes to “Heaven” as areward for a life well-lived, or goes to “Hell” as punishment for unrequited crimes.For the Heathen, however, the Otherworld was the only destination. Now that agross generalization has been made, the ubiquitous exceptions can be described.The conditions surrounding one’s death seems to have determined the final abodeof the soul. Holmberg inFinno-Ugric Mythologywhile discussing the beliefs of thetribes west of Russia, including the Saamí bordering Sweden.“During the pagan period, separate worlds for the good and the bad deadwere unknown.

The Underworld125during life, but according to that which had been the cause of their death[sic]. Those who died in battle or as the result of some accident did not goto the Underworld but peopled another world up in the heavens.”19Juha Pentikäinen in his brief essay “The Dead without Status” echoes the samethought but also includes the Germanic folk (both Heathen and Christian):“In that it contains the sociological termstatus,the concept of ‘deadwithout status’ is a reference to social position; it indicates that the problembefore us may be considered social as well as religious. The dead withoutstatus are thosewhose admission to the community of the departed has, forone reason or another, been denied(my emphasis). Such dead persons lackingposition or status either in the communities of the living or those of thedead, remain in a permanent transition phase that may be compared to theCatholic concept of Purgatory. Finnish belief tradition embraces a similarconcept,sijattomat sielut(placeless souls), which refers to those among thedeparted who are restless. In German tradition they are calledarme Seelen(poor souls).”20The cause of death or the condition of the corpse at the time of burial appearsto have been important throughout the entire northern half of Europe from theHeathen period well into this century.Most likely, the Land of the Dead was subdivided into different regions. It isquite probable that the early Germanic people saw the Afterlife as a reflection ofthis life. Communities of the dead, group of the dead traveling from one place toanother, the dead’s engaging in daily agricultural duties including herding cattle,cooking and weaving, engaging in battles between communities, and feeling ofhumanemotion are all commonly described activities throughout recorded history. If seeingthe Underworld as a reflection of Midgard is the most common view of the Land ofthe Dead in spite of the fact that it is contrary to Christian teachings, then there isonly one Land of the Dead as there is only one Land of the Living.Heathen reconstructionist groups of the latter half of the 20thcentury have atendency to glorify “death in battle” as some how being thenoblestway to diewith dying after a life of good works running a close 2nd place. Simply goinginto a common Land of the Dead is very distasteful for many if not most of the20thcentury Ásatrú folk. The Christian concept of “sitting at the right hand ofGod” seems to have washed over into their way of thinking so that “going into theHalls of their Gods” after death is far better than dying into the arms of their19op. cit.,p. 80.20Pentikäinen, Juha ”The Dead without Status” in Kvideland and SehmsdorfNordic Folklore,p. 128."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Chapter 5.

The idea is definitely modern, is most likely carry-over fromChristian upbringing,” and may never have really played any major part in theNorthern European Heathen worldview at all. This, however, is one of those thingsthat cultural anthropologists will be trying to sort out for a long time.The idea that becoming one of the “straw-dead”21was somehow a bad thing isan ill-founded modernism probably having its origin in the warrior sects of the LateViking Age. The Finns and the Saamí both had an ancient saying common into thiscentury that “going up” after death was a bad thing, and that “going downwards”(into the earth) was a good thing. “Going upwards” meant that one had died aviolent death, such as having been murdered or killed in battle, and the results ofthe bloody death could be seen in the night sky particularly in the omen of the“red lights,” a reddish aurora borealis, which forebode ill luck for the village. Intheir belief, they knew that the bloody dead went to the Finno-Ugric equivalent ofValhalla, and being usually a nonviolent people by nature, felt that an eternity ofwarfare and violence was one of the worst fates that could befall a person. Dyingback into the fold of the kin, where one was safe, fed, and loved, was ideal. Althoughthe Icelandic sagas are records of the exploits and lifestyles of a part-time-warriorsociety, most people in Scandinavia at the time were engaged primarily in agricul-ture, hence the need for gaining and holding the favor of the ancestors. For theprofessional mercenary, perhaps, the idea of becoming “straw-dead” was abhorrent,but, then, so was being stuck at home as a father/ farmer.Dying outside the circle of the kin was not a good thing. The drowned, forexample, were scooped up into the nets of Ran and were removed to her hall farbelow the waves. Egil Skallagrimson says“My lineage ends, like the storm-Felled maples of the forest.I have buried the bodiesOf too many of my kin.I search for speech, for tellingPraise of my long-dead parents.Words bud in my mind now, break,Blossom and blaze in green song.21”Straw-dead” is a kenning (Nordic-type metaphor) for one who dies in his/ her sleep eitherfrom illness or ”naturally.” In modern times, and probably in Heathen times as well, it is generallyused in a pejorative sense."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Chapter 5.

In the case of Egil’s son, thebody was found, and the funeral feast was made according to the ancient custom.Had the body not been found it would have been necessary to set up a memorial ofsome sort, a so-called “rune-stone,”most likely between the shore and the home, togive the dead one a new resting place beneath the earth. (Not every rune-stone wasset up for this reason, however.) Funeral pyres during mercenary or trading exploitsto far off places were also customary since the family burial ground was not readilyavailable, and funeral feasts and memorial stones were done just as if the warriorhad drowned. In any case, if one had died outside the kin circle, precautions werenecessary.In the 20thCentury, funerals and funeral preparations are done to placate theliving, but to the ancients this was not true. Minne-ales23were drunk 30 days aftera death and one year after a death. These “memory-ales” were drunk not simplyto honor the dead but also to help the deceased to remember those he/ she hadleft behind and that the family is ever in need of assistance. Minne-ales were alsodrunk to stay in good favor with the dead since the luck of the family flows fromthe Land of the Dead out into Midgard (see above). Juha Pentikáinen inNordicFolklorediscusses what he calls “the dead without status” quite extensively:22Egils Sagatr. by Christine Fell (Everyman’s Library; London, UK) 1975, pp. 146-49.23Literally ”memory-ales” or toasts to the honor of the dead usually done on the anniversaryof the death of a loved one (from the Old Englishminne= ”memory”)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld128“The intimate relationship between the family and its dead may be envi-sioned as a circle, one half of which is under the ground, the other half above. . . . The family organizes the funeral as well as periodic commemorativeceremonies, and provides for the dead by granting them part of the annualharvest. The dead direct threats against the family in the form of warningsagainst neglecting and against improper behavior.”24To offend the ancestors was to invite disaster to livestock, odal grounds, and kin,especially those yet to be born. To offend those under the ground, especially thosewhose status had moved up to local demi-god of the land, was to create somethingsimilar to a toxic waste dump. In New Age circles this is often described as “havingthe power of an area drained away,” but according to the Germanic worldview thenatural flow of the Waters of Life to an area was blocked.One is reminded of modern stories about businesses which will not prosper be-cause they are built over ancient Native American burial grounds. The stores orbusinesses are, in essence, the focus of revenge because the dead have been neglectedor dishonored and as revenge the flow of luck and prosperity which would normallyrise from the depths of the Underworld are being held back. In the 20thcentury, thedead are ignored for the most part unless they interfere with an individual’s abilityto make money.Niðstrond(“the strand of the corpses”;niðingwas the greatest insult a personcould receive, ”the lowest of people”), a place of suffering for evil or sociopathic peo-ple, is often interpreted as Christian in origin since the description of the inhabitantssuffering resembles that of a Christian Hell. But the concept ofNiðstronddoes notnecessarily have to have had a foreign source. In fact, the pre-Christian inhabitantsof the North seem very well to have understood the concept of a place of sufferingafter death (but not necessarily in a separate place as in the concept of a ChristianHell), which for them was any placeoutsidethe community as demonstrated by thepractice ofoutlawryas a form of punishment, prior to the invasion of the monks.The practices of outlawry and wergild as forms of retribution were practiced inNorthern Europe long before written history. If a man conducted himself in sucha way that he can no longer be safely supported by the community without harmcoming to that community, then he was sent away to dwell outside the realm ofhuman habitation. The concept of wergild was that not only is each man, woman,and child worth a certain price to a community, but that each body part was of valueas well. Wergild had to be paid by the wrong-doer when anyone was physically hurtor killed. The payment of wergild was an atonement for wrongs committed withinthe community and, in essence, was a way for an individual to buy his way back24op. cit.,p. 130."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld129into the community. If wergild was not paid for some reason, or if the crime was tooserious to allow for reintegration of the criminal into the community after payment,then a sentence of outlawry was commuted, which basically condemned the outcastto the wastelands outside the bounds of society, and the price of the wergild wasremoved from his own “head” at the same time which essentially condemned the manto death. He literally was free to be killed. If the term of outlawry was survived,the crime had been paid for, and the former outcast was re-enfolded into society.There were certain deeds which could not be atoned for in this life, and, there-fore, greatly affected life, in the Germanic way of thinking, as it continued in theUnderworld community. These were the betrayal and breaking of a formal oathto a comrade, friend, relative, or king, or the killing of a relative since wergildcould not be paid within the same family.25(Note: the payment of wergild wasan agreement between families, a negotiation.) A family could not pay itself forsomething it had done to itself; this is no payment at all. In these cases, afterdeath, the individual was outlawed by members of the ancestral community in theUnderworld which meant banishment to the northern wastelands, theNiðstrond.He was considered unfit to live within family or community, and being deprivedof family, companions, or a means of sustenance, there was only suffering, but nodeath or end to it all. Punishment after death in the Northern sense, then, is not ajudgement or proclamation of the Gods, it is simply being rejected by the family/community.The Underworld was viewed as a primary source of energy for the land, the com-munity and the family, but it was also the source of power/ luck for the individual.Luck or the individual’s or the family’s source of personal power flowed out fromthe Underworld and was disseminated throughout Midgard and the upper worldsas the result of an individual’s actions. One of the individual’s roles in life was tofunction as a distributor for that power, for the Waters of Life.According to tradition, there were three personal connections to the Underworld:thehamingja, thefylgja, and the body. Names for these connections exist or existedin traditions from other cultures as well usually associating the hamingja with theancestral line, the familial connection to the source of power/ luck, the fylgja as anindividual spiritual connector or guardian spirit, and the body or body/ soul complexas being fed bilaterally from the land (physical body) and the Underworld (ONhamr= “moldable spirit pattern for the body-shape”). Also, according to tradition, these25Wergild involved terms of payment of a price prescribed by the existing legal system forphysical damage caused to an individual. The terms of payment were agreed upon in front ofwitnesses by the families of the individuals involved. Payment of the wergild restored the individ-ual’s rights under the existing legal system. It should be noted, however, that restoration of rightslegally was not the same as restoration of social standing in the eyes of the community. Foote andWilson discuss this system in depth in theirThe Viking Achievement ..."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld130connections needed to be “groomed” and cared for, because if they were not, whatis commonly called “disease” could set in and cause generalized weakness to varyingdegrees or even death. Elf-shot, traditionally, was a source of weakness/ disease ora leaking-out of individual luck through holes in the hamr, whereas soul-loss or acomplete disconnection from the source of power was a cause of death.The hamingja and fylgja are interesting figures in the Underworld tradition. Be-cause the Scandinavian traditions of soul-craft and the Underworld have continuedto live in folk-tradition and have continued to evolve, some elements have tended tochange meaning or cause overlaps in distinction creating some technical problemsfor the modern 20thcentury researcher. In this age of science, the average persontends to like things to fit exactly into paradigms. Plants, for example, fit neatly intocomplex classification systems, and as new plants are discovered, they are found aplace in the botanical family tree; the plant, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to mindbecause it simplyexistsregardless of a scientist’s ability or inability to pigeon-holeit. Problems come up when one is confronted with a group of things which refuseto be neatly classified and such is the case with beings such as the hamingja andfylgja. One is perhaps better off defining the roles the beings play in the life of anindividual as opposed to attempting to classify the beings themselves.The overall function of the hamingja appears to be as an individual’s primaryconnection to the source of power flowing through the Underworld. Whether theconnection is to Hvergelmir, the source of the Waters of Life, no one can truly say.However, there does exist a description of its tie to ancestral lineage. Additionally,in a similar fashion, the luck of a family is usually passed down from generation togeneration as inViga-Glaums-sagawherein Vigfuss, Glum’s maternal grandfather,passed on his hamingja to Glum after dying. In this case, the name of the being“hamingja” is some confused with “fylgja” in the termkynfylgjaorfylgjakona.26Ingeneral, the hamingja takes the form of a woman, often helmeted, and appears largebut has no resemblance to any member of the family. Whether accompanying theindividual or the family, the being functions as the embodiment of the connectionto the source of luck, power, health, or prosperity pouring forth from the Land ofthe Ancestors.The distinction between individual or family luck becomes even more blurrybecause of little personalized “twists” put on it for the benefit of the individual. Infolklore, the motif of the fairy-godmother or of a group of three fairy-godmothers is26Kynfylgja,ON = ”kyn” (family) + ”fylgja” (guardian).fylgjakona,ON = ”fylgja” (guardianspirit) + ”kona” (woman). Generally, these terms are considered to be synonymous.The spirit was described inViga Glaum-sagaas a very large woman who was the embodiment ofthe family power/ luck."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld131often encountered. Much has been written about whether these beings are Norns(the Weavers of Fate), Dísir (demi-goddess protectresses), women of the álfar27, orancestral spirits. Judging by the amount of confusion the concept presents, in alllikelihood, all these theories are correct to some degree and classification becomesmeaningless. If this part of the system is viewed simply as “luck” which pours forthfrom the line of ancestors and which takes on a certain twist at the birth of anindividual, i.e. becomes personalized, there is at least some understanding of thefunction or the role the being plays, in spite of the inability to classify the actualbeing or beings.Luck is sometimes thought of as being a fixed storehouse of power. However,such an idea is not clearly indicated in the traditions of the ancient north as theyhave been passed down to us either through written of oral traditions. The hamingjadid not seem to function as a “store-house” of personal power or luck as some wouldhave it, but appears to have had more to do with access to power. Luck changes astimes change. If a relative died, the hamingja or fylgjakona moved on to the nextin line often as a last wish of the deceased but also apparently at the whim of thebeing itself.Access to luck was also apparently closely related to action. If a taboo, laidon the individual at birth (geis), was broken, the individual’s “access” to luck wasdecreased or completely inhibited. This is occasionally described as the individual’slosing “his power,” or having “his luck turn bad” or “his luck leave.” Davidson alludesto this connection:“The test of beliefs and practices was how far the individual who heldthem proved lucky and successful, for a fortunate man or woman was feltinstinctivelyto be in tune with the powers governing the world,(my emphasis)and it was prudent not to swim against the current.”28Gambling, which seems to have been a national pastime of our forebears, most likelyhad its origin as a method for “testing” access to luck as it does among many Northand South American tribal people to this day.Traditionally, the fylgja often took the form of an animal which was generallyrepresentative of an individual’s personality. A Swedish folk-tale tells of a younggirl who instead of going into a dance one night decided, for whatever reason, to27There is some argument as to whetherfemalesexisted among the álfar or not. The argumentseems pointless, however. What is really being discussed here is the idea that there was believed tobe some type of being which were 1) Otherworldly, 2) appeared to be more closely aligned with theGods (whether Vanir or Æsir), 3) and who seemed to have something to do with the assignmentor attachment of ̧orlögat or near birth.

The Underworld132peer through an open window. Inside the house where the dance was being held, shesaw different animals, such as foxes, geese, wolves, bears, etc., cavorting about theplace, and she recognized these animals as being the fylgja of the people attendingthe dance. All the animals dancing in the room reflected the personalities of thepeople there.These animals were also known to appear in dreams, and this is very well docu-mented in both folk-tale and in the sagas. In modern folk-lore research, the fylgjais sometimes called the dream soul. Kvideland and Sehmsdorf inNordic Folkloregive this description of the modern concept of the fylgja which apparently is nowa-days commonly mixed tightly with “conscious thought” or thehugham(ONhugr=“consciousness” or “thought”):“Although the hugham (variant spelling) and the fylge (variant spelling)often have the same appearance, the hug and hugham lead very unstablelives between the individual and the surroundings and can be consciouslycontrolled, while the fylgje and vor(d) are passive and people have very littlecontrol over them.”29The fylgja had an intimate connection with an individual so that there was noseparation until the death of the body, and in some cases the connection remainedafter a period of time even after death, particularly, if there was some unfinishedbusiness.That the fylgja was attached to the individual, as opposed to the hamingjaor kynfylgja whose connection to the individual was through one’s lineage, is wellattested. In Iceland, the fylgja was often described as being an animal which closelyrepresented the individual’s personality, but in Sweden and the Shetlands, the fylgjawas usually described as a doppelgänger, or an exact, otherworldly, duplicate of theindividual. People with the “second-sight” were able to see this double (either as ananimal or a person) and could tell much about an individual’s personality from it. InRobert Kirk’sThe Secret Commonwealththis being is described as the “co-walker”and throughout the northern lands there were many traditions surrounding it. Walk-ing a person to the door upon leaving was a common custom in all countries witha large population of Germanic/ Celtic ancestry which had its roots in allowing thefylgja out so that it did not become separated from the individual for separationcould mean death. Seeing one’s own fylgja or that of another often meant that deathwas immanent under certain conditions “If a person arrived immediately followingthevardöger(fylgja), he or she was going to die; if some time elapsed, the personwould live a long life.”3029Bente Alvers, ”The Concept of Soul in Nordic Folklore,” in Kvideland and Sehmsdorf, eds.,Nordic Folklore, 1989, p. 121.30ibid.,p. 118."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld133In folk tradition, the fylgja may also have been the vehicle for soul-travel duringsleep (“dreaming”) and for the Otherworld journeys of the noaide of the Samí culturealthough it should be mentioned that, in Norway, the dreamer did not always travelin the shape of a animal.31Additionally, the fate of the individual and his fylgjawere so closely tied that if the fylgja was injured during travel so also did theindividual suffer. The only apparent difference between traveling during sleep andtraveling voluntarily into the Otherworld was that during sleep the individual wasonly passively attending the dream-events, and during a noaide’s journey, the noaideor shaman was consciously aware and had control over his own behavior.Both the fylgja and hamingja, in function, had close ties to the Underworld and,no matter how they are described as beings, which is often confusing to the student oftradition and folk-lore, acted in ways very distinct from one another. The hamingjain its role as “guardian” as it is often described was a direct link through the lineof ancestors to the source of life. In itself, it did not “store” power, but dependingon an individual’s ability to disseminate power, functioned as a distributor. Thefylgja, in its role, worked in tandem with an individual, like a guardian angel inthe pop-Christian sense, to help lead him into situations which may have been ofbenefit from the standpoint of power. Such situations might have dealt with health,prosperity, or knowledge. Later on during the era of the Inquisition, individualswho had a good personal relationship with their fylgja often called these beingstheir “fetches.” An accused woman during a witch trial in 1660 described the fylgjaor vor(d) thus:“There is a vord in people’s breasts, which goes out at night when theyare asleep. And if an evil spirit comes and prevents it from coming backagain, that person will lose his mind unless it returns in a day or two.”32The vor(d) is a protector of a person’s health and well-being and is a Swedish wordfor “fylgja.”Caring for the ancestral line was important to virtually all the ancient NorthernEuropeans because of the need to maintain connections to the source of all power/luck which they knew to be deep in the Underworld. According to this line of logicno individual could truly function independently of the entire system; each hada role to play in the overall scheme of things. The “systems theories” now beingapplied in 20thcentury scientific thought is little more than an inevitable extensionof this age-old Heathen logic. The ancient Germanic peoples, however, realized that31In most of the Scandinavian stories about a dreamertravelingin his sleep, the dreamerperceives himself to still be human whereas a witness to the event (often another dreamer) sees thetraveler as an animal such as a bird, butterfly, wolf, etc. This differs from how a noaide perceiveshimself while traveling which is either as an animal or a man-spirit.32Østberg, KristianSvartboka(Oslo) 1925, p. 84."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Chapter 5.

Here the catalog of beings and roles that these beings played in thesystem of the Universe becomes uncountable. Everything in the visible world hadits Underworld counterpart. Everything had a “soul” hence the burying of weapons,tools, household goods, etc. with deceased persons; the recounting of the lineage ofa sword; or the naming of houses, boats, trees, etc. For the ancients, lineage wasimportant and was to be honored. For a tie to the past was a tie to the source oflife, and by “grooming” those ties, the Waters of Life remained free flowing.The Underworld tradition of the Teutons was already becoming misunderstoodand misrepresented by the time it was committed to writing by the Christians. Inthe folk mind, distinctions between concepts were already becoming blurry. Twelvehundred years of Christian indoctrination plus the growth of science which hasleaned towards breaking things down to their fundamental parts for analysis andclassification has damaged people’s ability to accept the idea that this are not allthere is, but that people themselves are only a small part of the whole. People areonly now beginning to realize that when a corpse is dissected for examination, forexample, they are no longer looking at ahumanbody because of one fundamentaldifference: a human bodylives. By regaining access to the ancestral lineage both interms of time and place, people will come to know exactly where they stand in theUniverse, and by doing so, they can come to know the limitless power of the Watersof Life flowing through the World Tree.Acceptance of relationships or connections between things and events and ofMidgard as being one small part of a whole is workable even in this day and age, butcomplete acceptance of the Germanic Underworld tradition is a little more difficult.First, people are trained from early on that non-physical beings outside of themselvesare constructs of the imagination, so to go around saying that one believes in elves,giants, dwarves, Gods, or ancestral or guardian spirits is to invite ridicule by peers,or worse, the local authorities. Consequently, the current trend is to talk aboutthe Underworld tradition in terms of symbols, analogies, and metaphors instead ofsimply accepting it for what it is: a worldview.The second reason that the Underworld tradition might be a little difficult toaccept is that there is another faddish tendency to make the Underworld traditioninto something that its not: a sweet, light, and airy place where all negatives areremoved. The Underworld like Midgard was divided in the early Germanic mind setinto halves, with the one half being the sanctuary of community and the other half aswilderness. Many in this modern age subscribe to an idea that the entire Universe isfilled with quaint butterfly winged fairies who cavort about the heads of those blessedwith Aquarian Age enlightenment just waiting for any chance to bestow glitteringgifts upon the New Age saints. This idea of ”fun elves and hobbits who love people”"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld135would not have only seemed foreign to the ancient Northern Europeans, but wouldhave been considered foolish or insane. Anyone believing such was leaving himselfopen to attack, illness, and possibly even death. The idea that the Underworld isa fun, cute, and exciting place is becoming relatively pervasive in the latter halfof the 20thcentury, however, so anyone proffering the idea that there might bedanger involved in the tradition will not only be viewed by the “authorities” asbeing slightly weird, but will also be lambasted by the newest generation of “psychicflower-children.”The Northern European Underworld is part of a worldview, a Germanic world-view to be precise, and in this worldview otherworldly beings, as with many inthe Land of the Living, are potentially dangerous. Destruction and creation areside-by-side processes. The ancient Germanic peoples did not survive by hidingthemselves in a quaint fairy-tale fantasy but by plowing their fields, butcheringtheir animals, and fighting and killing off invading forces when necessary. Theirworldview provided them with information regarding choices in the course of action.They lived their lives in the physical world as they interpreted it; they did not livea pretend life within the constructs of their imaginations.Another area of “wishful thinking” which is imposed by the New Age upon theGermanic worldview is that of reincarnation. The debate can (and reallyhas) goneon endlessly about whether or not the ancient Germanic people believed in someconcept which involved the transmigration of souls. This, for the most part, is animportation of the whole East-West connection thing (discussed in Chap. 2). It is anice philosophy which involves the learning of life’s lessons over a cycle of lifetimesand will not really be dealt with here. It should be mentioned, though, that in somerare cases in sagaic and eddaic literature, an individual (or at least part of him) wasrebornto carry out a specific task usually related to revenge or leadership. The twocases usually dredged up for “proof” of the belief of reincarnation are those of HelgiHundingsbane33(from the Sigurd cycle) and of St. Ólaf34. Without belaboring thepoint, Helgi had an act of revenge which needed to be carried out, and St. Ólafdenied being reincarnated. The fact that the individual asking St. Ólaf about thepossibility of reincarnation most probably relates to the idea that if a soul is notcompletely laid to rest, it will wander. Reincarnation, as it is commonly understoodtoday, most likely did not have a place in the early Germanic worldview. The passingon of familial luck/ power through the hamingja, and unrestful souls, however, did.These ideas are presented above and in Chap. 2.On the other hand, the ancient Underworld tradition is applicable in the 20thcentury and forms the basis of one of the most profound forms of transformation33Hollander, LeeThe Poetic Edda(University of Texas Press; Austin, TX) 1964, p. 179.34For a discussion of this see Ellis-Davidson’sMyths and Symbols in Pagan Europe,p. 122."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Chapter 5.

Its power is attested by literary authors, as well as clinicalpsychologists, as being probably the most common motif for personal-transformationand has been so since mankind has been engaged in the writing process. Evenbeyond literature, in the realm of the average person, near-death experiences havebeen transforming people since the beginning of time. Every single small communitycan name at least one person whose life has been drastically altered for the betterby a close brush with death, i.e. the Underworld, and over the past two decadesor so, many with terminal diseases such as cancer or AIDS whose lives have beenlengthened by modern medicine have given lectures, been on talk shows, and havewritten books about how their living with death has altered their views of life. Theapplicability of the Underworld tradition, then, is to allow people the chance to re-align their attitudes about living long before their own deaths occur. To accomplishthis, however, it is necessary that people learn to attend to, accept, and learn fromtheir own mortality, i.e., their own deaths.The Underworld tradition dealt with death. Reincarnation, although not totallyunknown, was not a part of the Germanic system of thought. For the most part,when someone died, he wasnotcoming back. Death is something from whichpeople hide these days. They like to soften the blow of the concept of death byusing euphemisms in their speech like “passed on,” or “went to a better life.” Deathis not discussed. All arrangements for burial of the “dearly departed” are left tofuneral directors. In fact, people have separated themselves so far from death thatthey don’t even know how to go through the normal process of grieving and needpsychologists and counselors to help them move beyond the “passing away of a lovedone.”Not only is human death not dealt with in any realistic way, but neither is thedeath of pets, or even stock animals for food. Some are even unable to cope withthe autumn of the year because the falling of the leaves reminds them too muchof death. People have separated themselves from death and do everything possibleto keep from getting too near it. Some try to stave it off with longevity programsconsisting of drinking down herbal formulas or eating special diets, some throughthe science of cryogenics. Some choose to turn their attention in other directionslike to “Pearly Gates” or “Violet Flames” and, in doing so, ignore the facts of life onthe planet earth or at least consider them to be somewhat loathsome. Modern folkhide from death and do their damnedest to keep from being found.Contemplation on death and mortality, at least as far as life on Midgard isconcerned, can be one of man’s greatest sources of wisdom.

One needs onlyto contemplate mortality. Much of a modern person’s time, energy, and sense of"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld137well-being is spent in maintaining the illusion of immortality. Because of immortal-ity, or the illusion of such, one can afford to believe that all of life’s little details areof greatest importance, and because everything thing is important to such a greatmagnitude, many spend their illusory immortal years pondering the “right decision.”In this sense, the ancient Scandinavian knew where the source of wisdom truly lay:in the Underworld, the Land of the Dead. These “great decisions,” most of whichare little more than silly pontifications made great only by the amount of time andenergy put into them, can usually be pared down to realistic proportions in the faceof one’s own demise. If one is going to be put under the grass tomorrow, a greatdecision like whether to “buy American” or to “go with a Japanese model” becomesrelatively meaningless and trivial. Contemplation of death and mortality carries themessage that there really are very few “big” decisions, and in this way, ancestralwisdom can be utilized.There is an interesting phenomenon which seems to be common to those nearingdeath: they tend to drop all the meaningless little details of life, the things thatthey once thought were so important, and try to put their lives in order before theydie. They call their family together, atone for harm they have brought to othersor to hose they have neglected through the years, and, in general, attempt to dealwith only those things that are truly important. Most curiously, those are the verythings about which theHávamálspeaks: family, friendship, quality of a life lived,and the prospect of leaving a fair name for oneself. The entire chaotic list of life’slittle details fall together for the very first time in many cases, so that only the trulyimportant things carry meaning. Without an Underworld tradition, modern manmust wait until he is confronted with the reality of death before the true meaningof life, the wisdom of the ancestors, makes itself known.The Germanic concept of Midgard has much to do with people’s desire andability to place themselves spatially in the universe utilizing the constructs of theWorld Tree and the Flow of the Waters of Life. Within such a world view, eachhas a place and a function which is not separated from anything else (see Chap..3). This is not difficult to accept or realize because it is observable in the worldat large. On the other hand, the Underworld tradition is only observable in theeffectsthat it has on people’s behaviors, in their sense of well-being, and in theirpersonally-experienced quality of life. That those who have undergone near-deathexperiences have been changed by the experience is rarely doubted, but exactlywhat has been changed is not always clear. These changes cannot be seen directlybut can only be experienced, and experience without physical evidence is difficultfor the 20thcentury mind. The tradition of Midgard places one spatially withinfamilies, communities, and the World Tree, but the Underworld tradition places onetemporally."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. The Underworld138For the early Teutons, life was viewed in cycles, and birth and death were apart of one of the cycles. Another was the yearly cycle of the seasons. Agriculturalpeoples are more closely attuned to the yearly progression of the seasons than ismodern man and this yearly cycle included, obviously, dealing with work as theweather permitted but, also, with the cycle of holidays and festivals celebrated bothwithin the family unit (such as birthdays, rites of passage, etc.) and outside thefamily unit (such as community celebrations, funerals, festivals, markets, etc.).For the ancients, forces emanating up from the Underworld, the Land of theAncestors, forced changes on Midgard, but with these changes also came the senseof continuity or “sameness.” Everything, for the ancient Germans, had a birth anda death whereupon the cycle was started anew. Change, for them, was acceptablebecause of their belief in the somewhat circular nature of time. For modern man,there is generally a sense of “pending doom” because in modern philosophical termsof the average man “time” is linear; therefore, the world as it is changing todayis progressing towards a chaotic end. “Society is getting worse!” the papers say.“Pollution is out of control!” Thinking in terms of a linear flow of time is depressingand it is no wonder that modern folk have such a difficult time accepting change.This new generation, this Generation X, is seen by many as the-end-of-it-all. Theyare violent, apathetic, they do not attempt to live within the bonds of society asit exists; they question everything and offer no solutions. In one sense, however,a cyclical sense, they are nothing more than the newest cycle of the Baby Boomergeneration of the 1960’s and curiously enough resemble in many ways the genera-tions which produced the Viking Age! Everything changes but somehow there is asamenessrunning through it all.In the ancient mind, everything moved in cycles, but the force driving the cyclesappears to have come from elsewhere. For the ancient Teutons, the force came fromthe Land of the Dead which is implied in the reciprocal relationship between theUnderworld and Midgard sometimes used as illustration in Germanic folklore butmore prominent in folklore bordering the Germanic realm. The idea of ancestorworship which is repugnant to some is not really necessary to participate in theUnderworld tradition. All that is needed is the development of a sense of accep-tance and respect for one’s own starting point and for the forces which createdthat starting point, i.e., the ancestors of one’s personal lineage. Grooming thelinks between the Underworld and Midgard need not be really any more elaboratethan offering an attitude of thankfulness, which, for the ancient Germanic peoples,occurred communally during the primary festivals of the year: Winternights, Júl,and Summernights.

The Underworld139Modern psychologists have interviewed people who have endured near-death ex-periences rather extensively, and there are certain factors in these interviews whichare quite common to most of them. The survivors report an increased passion forlife in general, and a decrease in taking for granted simple things like health, anda sense of well-being. For the ancients, these things were gifts passed on throughfamily lines, things such as luck, health, and prosperity. For them as well as forthose who have faced death, these things were not simply part of being human norwere they birthrights; they were “gifts” handed up through the family lineages andwere ”granted” by forces outside themselves. If these things were truly part of beinghuman, then humans should have complete control over them, but the fact is “theydo not.” The fact is that luck, health and prosperity can whither away slowly or,sometimes, very quickly with no rhyme or reason.

For centuries scholars raised and educated in aChristian world have been trying to make some kind of sense out of mythologies orworldviews which were considered normal by ancient Heathens but are completelyalien to modern man and which have long since disappeared leaving only small buttantalizing traces of what were probably complex systems of thought. Because aperson can only define something using terms, analogies, and comparisons that areborne out his own cultural background, understandable during his own time, eachinterpretation reflects his own culture. Making the leap in thinking, i.e. completelyswitching worldviews, is for all practical purposes impossible. The old fishing, hunt-ing and agricultural communities are gone, and if one such community has continuedto exist, it is so completely changed through modern technology like electricity, im-proved transportation, and faster, more efficient communication that it does noteven remotely resemble itself from a hundred years ago, never mind a thousand.During the mid- to late-1800’s, when the theory of evolution was fairly new, schol-ars were automatically lead to think in terms of linear development from “primitiveto sophisticated,” and, consequently, interpretations of northern mythology such"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky142as those promoted by Frazer, Anderson, or Kaufmann were related to the ideathat religion must have developed from a primitive form comprised of vegetationand fertility Gods since these were the only things that a cave-dwelling hunter andgatherer could have been concerned about. When these men wrote about Germanicmythology, they did so with a historical approach; the “old Gods had passed on.”To them this was obvious and inevitable because the natural evolution of societyfrom the simple agrarian to the much more complex industrial/ scientific necessarilycreated the need for a “new God,” being more sophisticated Himself, and, therefore,more sympathetic and suitable to the needs of a new world.Later, beginning in the late 1800’s and continuing on for nearly a century, thedevelopment and practice of behavioral sciences such as psychology, sociology, neu-rology, and anthropology, helped to produce a whole new breed of “interpreters”which includes the famous Freud, Jung, and their descendants, Georges Dumezil,Jan DeVries, and a list of followers much too long to be included here. Their interpre-tations included much material that had come before, but they also modified someof it to suit the development of the “new sciences.” This generation of interpretersbelieves that the Gods have not passed completely away but that they continueto live on in the folk-, collective-, cultural-, or genetic memories of mankind asarchetypes, and that they resurface on a regular basis to guide folk towards theireventual destinies as whole and complete beings. This resurfacing of archetypalthought-patterns has been interpreted as the cause or at least the facilitator ofevery great event of mankind from time immemorial.1By continuing to pursue this line of reasoning, these new behavioral scientists be-lieve that their understanding of archetypes will eventually lead to the understandingof why people do what they do; at any rate, that is the theory. For these scientists,the Gods do not live outside human consciousness but are actually part of its veryfabric; they live within the very neurochemical patterning of human existence. Thenew move in sciences is towards either existentialism or Taoism, saying that thereis no such thing as objective existence, that all perception is subjective, i.e. canbe had only from the viewpoint of the observer. The observer and the observedare inextricably intertwined so that it becomes impossible, in a Cartesian sense,to determine the existence of anything outside the self. Oddly enough, however,these same men of science continued to present their material from the traditionalviewpoint of the “objective observer”; they were not able to make a clean breakfrom the viewpoint of their predecessors. Right or wrong, this anthropocentric view1Carl Jung, the psychologist and foremost promoter of the ”archetype theory” wrote an essayin the 1930’s called ”Woden” which attempted to show how an entire society could be lead toaccept a single worldview. The upshot of the essay was that Germany was being reshaped by thenorthern Germanic archetype of Woden (ONÓðínn)."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky143permeates every aspect of human life in a large percentage of modern industrializednations, and it is exceedingly difficult to write about the objective reality of theGods without looking very naive, simple, or just plain foolish.Starting in the late 1950’s (occurring only rarely before that), some rebellious an-thropologists, psychologists, and a handful from the other behavioral sciences as wellbegan to disregard evolution, anthropocentrism and the whole objective/ subjectiveproblem and began to go straight for the heart of things: personal experience. Thiswas a break from the traditional approach of being the “objective observer” whichwas started several centuries ago, but also from the “subjective observer stance.”There is no longer “the observer”; there is instead “the participant.” One wouldthink that such an approach would be acceptable in modern science since the ideathat nothing can be observed directly had been around in the “hard sciences” forseveral decades prior to the “anthro-rebels” picking up the ball and running withit, but this was not the case. An anthropologist who chooses to “participate” inthat which he is supposed to be observing is considered to be no true researchscientist of human behavior for by their very participation they are “spoiling” theobjectivity of the project and, therefore, are contaminating the results. Often thesepeople are outlawed from the scientific community to live in the borderlands ofpop culture alongside charlatans, quacks, and confidence men. Colin Turnbull,2Michael Harner,3Florinda Donner,4Stanislov Grof, and Timothy Leary5are onlynow beginning to gain some recognition in the fields that they truly explored: those2Turnbull wrote a book about his experiences with the rainforest pygmies. The book, however,was written in a documentary-story format wherein not only did he describe his experiences, buthe actually talked about how itfeltto be with these people. Not only did he discuss hisfeelingsbut he actually had the audacity to present himself as a human being suffering from culture shockand completely capable of the worst thing a cultural anthropologist could ever engage in:humanerror.His story was calledChildren of the Rainforestand has been out of print for many years.3Harner’s experiences among theJívaroof the Amazon Basin resulted in his writingTheWay of the Shaman(Harper & Row Publ.; New York, NY) published in 1980 and his startingthe New Age movement of neo-shamanism (at least from a business point of view) through hisfounding of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies. Although the activities of this his ”foundation”are respectable in the eyes of some it is still regarded with much suspicion by many of the old-styleanthropologists.4Ms. Donner has written three books in the style of Turnbull, and along with Carlos Cas-taneda, is most often considered a fraud by the ”professional community.” This is not to say thatsheisa fraud, but her writing style is so much from a personal experience point of view that thestory itself could not be proven (whatever that means) to have occurred in physical reality.5Both Grof and Leary were pioneers in the use ofd-lysergic acid diethylamide(LSD-25) inserious studies in psycho therapies and the study of human consciousness.

The Sky144of personal experience, altering one’s frame of reference (state of consciousness), andthe overall effects that these things had upon reality or perception of reality (160).For these folk whether the Gods lived inside as archetypes or outside as part of anobjective reality made no difference: experience through personal participation wasthe only possible key.What is the validity of human experience? Who knows? Interaction betweenGods and men is well documented in the eddaic and sagaic literature (160), and totake a man’s description of such an interaction and to reinterpret it as a meetingwith an inner archetype or as an encounter with a Dumezilian function, or as anencounter with a “Christ-metaphor” is to demean or degrade the personal experienceto suit another’s needs and desires. For an individual, an encounter with a God, aspirit, or a dead ancestor is a meeting with power/ luck, i.e., a lineage. It is a fullparticipation in a personal experience and needs no further interpretation . This isthe approach taken here. Often it may sound as if the Gods as They are presentedhere do have an objective existence beyond the human realm of perception, and ifthat is the case, so be it.Personal experience, as well as group experience, was obviously very impor-tant to the early Germanic peoples. Evidence for this lies in the fact that eventhough their religion was organized to some degree, at least a local level, individualsand communities varied greatly from each other in their approach to the northernpantheon, so that some communities, such as many early Swedish kingdoms, weremore closely allied with the Vanir and landvættir, while others, particularly in thelater-developing Viking communities, aligned themselves with warrior Gods such asÓðínn. Not only were there differences between geographical locations, but a singlecommunity could change its godly allegiances over time so that a community thatwas once part of a Vanic cult would gradually become part of the cult of Óðínn orÞór. Iceland’s history also shows a wide variety of approaches to religion so thatindividuals arriving in the same fleet could belong to the cults of Óðínn, Þór, andeven the White Christ, while some of the professional warriors professed atheism.Obviously, the northern Germanic people, for the most part, were very tolerant ofdifferences between themselves, and that personal experience (or group experience)and cultural legacy were of primary importance.The northern Heathen view of the Gods was much different than that of theChristians towards their God, which has kept Heathenism almost incomprehensibleto the Church of Rome for almost two millennia. In the Christian mind, as with thefollowers of many of the other “southern religions”, the “true God” is omnipotent.The Heathens, on the other hand, knew that their Gods, although powerful, aresubject to the same universal laws as any other part of Creation (the Tree), i.e., ̧orlög (see Chap. 2).

They also knewthat their Gods held no immunity against death. Balder, son of Óðínn and Frigg,was killed by the blind God, Höð, burnt on the funeral pyre, and now resides in theunderworld Halls of Hel, Goddess of the Land of the Dead. Ragnarök, the battlethat will destroy the Universe at the end of time will bring many of the great Godsto the end of their lives.How different from the all-powerful God of the Christians. So different, in fact,that one of the great ecclesiastical questions supposedly to help convince the Heathento convert was “If your Gods are so powerful then why do they require sacrifice?”The Christian answer to this question was obvious: “Since the Heathen Gods are notomnipotent, and the ‘true God’ is, it follows that the Heathens are worshiping mortaldemons who have been deceiving the ignorant barbarian, and who are ultimatelysubject to Jehovah’s judgement in the end times; therefore, it is Christian duty thatthe Heathen barbarians be saved from eternal damnation as a public service of theMother Church.” In the year 1014 CE, Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, preached thefollowing as part of his “Sermon on False Gods”:“Many other Heathen Gods also were devised in various ways, and Hea-then Goddesses likewise held in great honor throughout the world to the ruinof mankind; but these, though, are reckoned the most important in paganism,although they lived foully in the world. And the scheming Devil, who alwaysdeceives mankind, brought those Heathen men into profound error so thatthey chose as Gods for themselves such vile men who had made their vilelust a law for themselves and for as long as they lived spent all their lives inuncleanness.But blessed is he who completely scorns such affairs and loves and honorsthe true God who created and fashioned all things.”6Differences, which were tolerated by the ignorant barbarian as belonging to a per-sonal viewpoint, were believed by the more enlightened Christian to be but evildeceptions created by the Devil in his continuing befuddlement of mankind. It isinteresting to note that punishment or death for “heresy” and “blasphemy,” werenot punishable crimes during the Heathen Age; the burning of heretics was a phe-nomenon which came later and was associated only with the Holy Mother Churchand the coming of the Prince of Peace to northern Europe.Actually, the confusion suffered by the Christians as to why the Heathen sotenaciously held onto his set of older beliefs rather than automatically converting6Swanton, Michael, translator and ed., Anglo-Saxon Prose (Everyman’s Library; London)1993, p. 187."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky146to a religion worshiping an all-powerful God was a byproduct of their worldview.In the early Christian way of thinking, the entire Universe was created and sup-ported/ maintained by a single God who, in spite of delegating some power to otherbeings like angels, saints, etc. for various trivial reasons, was the absolute, and soleauthority over heaven and earth. The Heathen definition of a God, if one can beput together, was a being who was powerful and knowledgeable about the WorldTree, its function and all its inhabitants, and who could play direct or indirectroles in the preservation of It right up to the Ragnarök. To the Heathen, a Godwas like a king whose kingdom was the entire Tree, Lærað, and whose authorityover the inhabitants of Midgard was as parents to children: loving, strict, but notover-bearing. If a Heathen felt that one God had interfered too much in the affairsof his life, he, as often children do, rebelled, sometimes even changing his allegiance.Egil Skalla-grimson, the famous Icelandic poet, warrior, and general rogue, in apoem known as the Sonatorek (“The Wreck of the Sons”), laments his often blindtrust in Óðínn but considers the burden of his sons’ deaths his own rather thanblaming his patron God:“And then I think of Óðínn:A branch was torn from my tree,But Óðínn bore it awayTo the high halls of the Gods.This God has been good to me.Yet I trusted Him too muchAnd more than was good for me,For He did allow that death.Still, I sacrifice to Him–Not eagerly, but becauseHe gave me my two great giftsAnd they salve my heaviest hurts.”7Within 150 years of Egil’s death, the above poem, had it been written about theGod of the Christians, would have been considered a blasphemy and, consequently,punishable under canonical law.7Fell, Christine, tr., Egil’s Saga (Everyman’s Library; London, UK)1975, pp. 148-48."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky147Interestingly, it was the Heathen definition of a God which eventually allowedfor the acceptance of the Christian religion. Initially, people did not give up theirreligion, their allegiance to the Æsir, the Vanir, the landvættir, and the ancestors atall but accepted the triune God of the Christians, particularly the “White Christ,”(see Chap. 8) into their pantheon as an equal. Traders, kings, warriors, and, ofcourse, entire communities, have all been recorded in the sagaic literature as beingprone to “dual-religionism.” Traders, because of their occupational need to dealwith a great number of people, would often accept the God of the new religionbut continue sacrificing to the Gods of their fore-fathers as well. Helgi the Lean inIceland“ . . . one of the best known of these [dual-religionists]8. . . grew up inIreland. He believed in Christ, but would call on Þór to guide him at sea,and when great decisions had to be made. When he drew near to the coastof Iceland, he called on Þór to tell him where to land, and the answer camethat he must go to the North. But when he had established his new home,Helgi called it Kristnes (Christ’s Headland), as it is called today.”9The tolerance of the early northern Teutons, however, was not their undoing; it wasa combination of the intolerance of the new-religionists, conversion of high profilepolitical figures, Christian customs which essentially tainted all Heathen holidayswith “christianized interpretations,” and forced conversion of the common folk byfigures such as King Olaf the Holy who viciously persecuted, and executed, as manyHeathens as he could possibly find. Even so, the tenacity of belief in the northernGods in conjunction with the Germanic world view made the conversion to be avery slow and painful process.The Germanic view of the world as being a place of ever changing flow of power/luck was a system which supported the northern pantheon and was provable throughpersonal experience. For the early Germanic people, the all-or-nothing philosophy ofthe Christian worldview left too many paradoxes which could only be reconciled withvery weak explanations. The northern view allowed for “good years” and “bad years”although each would strive to improve their lot over the course of time. Personalexperience showed that ancestral lands which have been long cared for tended toproduce more consistently, for example, because the family over time had aligneditself with the power/ luck of the land through sacrifice and through the laying ofthe dead into the soil. New land, on the other hand, was a more precarious venture8Note: the term \"dual-religionism\" would be from a Christian point of view because for theHeathen the acceptance of Jesus would be simply adding one more God into a pantheon whichalready existed.9Turville-Petre Myth and Religion of the North (Greenwood Press; Westport, CT) 1964, p.88."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky148with many unknown variables as in the case when the first settlers came to Icelandand needed to deal with the yet “wild” landvættir who had up to the time of thefirst settlers little or no interaction with men. It was understandable, then, thatthere would be many bad years until the immigrant family had completely aligneditself with the flow of luck seeping up from the Underworld or had been able to coaxluck to flow their way. This was a natural course of life in the Germanic worldview.But, for the Christian, any bad year was automatically interpreted by the Churchto be a punishment for some transgression against the new God (which may havebeen somewhat confusing for the newly converted Christian who believed he hadcommitted no “sins”). For the Heathen, life was simply a series of struggles whichcould in most cases be overcome through knowledge of ̧Orlög, and proper actionwhich would lead eventually to lining oneself up with the same Flow of the Watersof Life which fed the entire World Tree. Such an “all-or-none philosophy” did notmatch up easily with the unpredictability of lands of the North.The Landnamabók (“The Book of Settlements”), the Islandingabók (“The Bookof the Icelanders”), and much of the sagaic literature reveals the function of theGods for the early Germanic people which also differs greatly from how They wereseen by the Christians. “Function” here refers to the actual roles that the ancientsbelieved their Gods to play in their daily lives. In the early settlement of Iceland,as is clearly stated in the sagaic literature, the northern Gods “guided” settlers totheir new homes, and guidance from the Gods is a key issue from the earliest knownwritings about the Germanic peoples up through the Viking Age and well intothe Age of Conversion. Tacitus, writing around the 1st century CE, describes theGermans as placing much value in the reading of lots (which some have interpretedto mean slips of wood with runes or proto-runes engraved on them) and omens, andthat they would not make a move either agriculturally or in war until the “signs,”presumed to be communications from the Gods, Ancestors, or spirits of nature, wereright for it. In the settling of Iceland, it was common for the ship’s master or theleader of the expedition to seek an omen which would result in the settling intoa lucky place which would prosper. Although there are very few formal prayersdirectly from the Heathen Era, many of them must have contained a line similarto “(name of deity) lead us to . . . ” as opposed to the formal Christian phrasing of“God give (or ‘grant’) us . . . ” for in the Heathen philosophy “a gift ever looks fora gift.” The role of the Heathen Gods as guides recurs over and over in the earlywritings.The idea of northern Gods as guides concurs well with the early Germanic worldview as presented so far. The Waters of Life which maintain the health of Yggdrasilneed to be constantly modified and changed to suit the needs of the Tree itself soto hold off Its collapse (Ragnarök) as long as possible. The joint efforts between"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky149the two tribes of Gods, the Æsir and the Vanir, had led to the creation of theinhabitants of Midgard to that end, but since man nor spirit have direct access toknowledge of the entire Tree (from the Well of Mimir), they need guidance so thatthe proper “shaping” of the Waters (through the layering of ̧orlög) can take placeultimately preserving the Tree and, consequently, the lands of the giants, the Gods,and men. In the Teutonic mind-set, the relationship between the folk and the Godswas that each individual had some role to play towards a common goal rather thanthe type of relationship between a Christian and his omnipotent God who had Hisown separate and secret agenda in spite of His Followers.Gift-giving (blót) to the Gods was fairly common, but the concept behind it wasslightly different than what the more Christian word “sacrifice” implies. Gift-givingfrom man to man and from man to spirit has already been described in earlierchapters and the basic format still holds true even with the Gods. For centuries, ithas been understood that for whatever reason the various Gods of the northern pan-theon “needed” gifts; this is a terribly poor and jaded interpretation of the concept.From the eddaic descriptions of the Gods, they already had everything necessary totheir survival and those things could never have possibly been provided by man: theapples of Idunna, huge vats of mead, etc. Whatever a community or an individualwas able to provide would have been but a part of a meal and a single quaff ofmead for Þór. If “divine needs” were taken care of by tri-annual sacrifices, Ragnarökwould have come after the very first sacrifice millennia ago because the Gods wouldhave starved to death. The early Germanic people were pragmatists, and surelyrecognized early on that they were not “supporting the existence” of their Gods.The ecclesiastical question then posed above is merely an early piece of rhetoric.Gift-giving between man and God was purely a matter of honor and good-faith.Man gifted man to align himself with power/ luck in terms of lineages (see Chap.2), and man gifted a God for the same reason. A sacrifice to a God was in a sensetelling the God that a community or an individual would allow themselves to beguided through this life, would work with rather than work for the God, etc. Thebasic format of this “gifting the Gods” really was no different than a man gifting aking as a show of faith and loyalty. And just as a warrior would give his war-leadercredit for a successful raid through the composing of poetry and offering of praise, soalso gave the farmer credit to Gods for a successful season. Additionally, sacrificialanimals were eaten by the participants. Apparently, a sacrifice was little more thana feast planned and executed to the honor of a God or Gods, at least in the Heathenway of thinking, rather than a method for taking care of a deity’s needs.Gift-giving10from the Gods to man was also slightly different than the Christian10Chapter 3, Midgard, deals with the topic of gift-giving. In this modern day, folks generallythink of gift-giving as a type of \"reward,\" but in the older philosophy based on the Germanic"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky150concept. Gifts from the Gods were not necessarily “rewards” for good deeds doneor for being on one’s best behavior. To understand the concept, one would do wellto look at how kings treated their retainers. Kings gifted their men for a varietyof reasons. A successful raid, for example, meant a surplus of wealth within acommunity which needed to be “shared.” A common kenning, or poetic metaphor,for a king or war-leader in this circumstance was “gold-hater,” i.e., “someone whodoes not value gold except that it makes a good gift to someone else.” Gold wasalso gifted to a man for a poem well turned, for a song well sung, for a joke wellplayed, for a battle well fought, or simply for friendship’s sake. The intertwining ofluck/ power is of greatest importance here.11Interaction between lineages, as stated in Chapter 2, is the very foundation ofall relationships in the early Germanic way of thinking, and the interaction betweenthe lineages of Gods and people was no different. The Gods had long and powerfullineages which reached far back to the beginning of time and which connected themto all lands within the World Tree; therefore, They had access to true knowledge.Mankind, on the other hand, was very limited in its access to knowledge, but becauseof its ability to engage in action which could effectively alter the state of the Watersflowing out of the Well of Urð at any given point in time, it had access to a power, i.e. ̧orlög, which the Gods needed. As a team of sorts, the combination of the lineages ofGods and of mankind, i.e. of knowledge with action, the entire Tree benefits. Thisrelationship between deities and mankind is the exact reflection of that between aking and his retainers, a war-leader and his warriors, or, ideally, a peasant farmerand his bondsmen. This is also the relationship stressed throughout the Hávamál:“Give your friends gifts– they’re as glad as you areto wear new clothes and weaponsfrequent giving makes friendships lastif the exchange is equal.” (st. 41)and“If you have a friend you feel you can trustand you want him to treat you wellworldview presented here, \"gift-giving\" was important because that was one of the ways thatlineages could be crossed or intertwined. Gift-giving by a king to a retainer or by a God to a manwas done out of a \"need\" on the part of the giver, a \"need\" whereby the giver is able to participatein the ørlög of the receiver. Gift-giving, then, is a matter of power/ luck as opposed to the simplemoving of a material object from one person to another.11Sturluson, Snorri The Prose Edda, translated by Anthony Faulkes, (Everyman’s Library;London, UK) 1987, p. 114."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Chapter 6.

He was a close friend of Þór, and had charge of Þór’s temple thereon the island (Mostur Island off South Hordaland), so people called himÞórolf. A tall, powerful man, Þórolf was very handsome and his long beardgot him the nickname Mostur-Beard. He was respected above all other menon the island”13Not only can the relationship between God and man be seen here, but, so also canthe result of the relationship, that of accessing power/ luck through the blendingof the two lineages, i.e. the “respect” and the “high regard” of Þórolf by his fellowislanders as well as the success of the farm (which continued long after his death).That the relationship between deities and mankind mirrored the relationshipbetween king and subject is interesting. Prior to the coming of Christianity to theNorth, kingdoms were small and kings interacted with individual subjects withinthe protective boundaries of the kingdom and, for that matter, with the land, itself.12Terry, Patricia Poems of the Elder Edda (University of Pennsylvania Press) 1990, pp. 16-18.13Eyrbyggja Saga translated by Hermann PÃ¡lsson and Paul Edwards (Penguin Classics;London, UK) 1989, p.27."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky152Heathen kings often traced their lineages back to one of the Gods in the north-ern pantheon, to Ingvi-Frey in Sweden and to Woden in Anglo-Saxon England,and because of this relationship to the Gods, they were the inheritors of the mostpowerful lineage of the kingdom. They stood at the center of the community’s orthe kingdom’s access to power/ luck. Interaction with subjects and the land werepart of their function, their role as a king14. After the coming of Christianityto the northern lands, a king’s power was deemed granted by an omnipotent, butimpersonal, God, and, as a consequence, the role of a king changed so that he was nolonger considered to be an integral part of the kingdom but a ruler over it. Personalinteractions between king and subjects became less and less frequent and more of aformality. By the 1300’s, kings were viewed by the people as earthly embodimentsof the “new” God, Jehovah. Kings were now worshiped out of obligation ratherthan out of respect. Anything less was now a legal form of heresy, commonly calledtreason.Because of the Germanic sense of the cosmic flow of time and order, and becauselife in the Underworld was considered to be but a continuation of life on Midgard,the Heathen focus was more towards the here and now and less time, if any at all,was devoted to the idea of life-after-death. In fact, the only time that life afterdeath is mentioned as a concern in the classical northern literature is when it affectsthe present, i.e., for the making of funeral preparations or for tapping into the flowof luck coming up through the line of ancestors. Some warriors expected to go toValhalla after death, but the Underworld tradition was by far the strongest of thetwo and was most likely the older. Dying into Valhalla as part of the warrior’s way oflife (discussed in Chapter 5) was a phenomenon which seems to have been a late de-velopment in Scandinavian thought and a product of the Viking Age. Turville-Petrediscusses this briefly in his Myth and Religion of the North:“It could be said that the name Óðínn was purposely avoided in somedistricts because the God was revered so deeply as to be unmentionable. Butthere is a more natural explanation. If those of the western districts knewÓðínn, they had neither respect for Him as a God nor love for all He stoodfor. I have suggested that the cult of Óðínn spread widely and rapidly in theninth and tenth centuries.”15Besides, the warrior still needed to pass through the Underworld on his way toValhalla as can be seen by the need for “Hel-shoes” so that the warrior can “walkthe Hel-way” on his journey to the Hall of Óðínn (see Chap. 5).14Turville-Petre, pp. 190-95.15Turville-Petre,op. cit.,p. 69."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky153Neither the Gods nor men appeared to be overly concerned about the future.Man’s destiny was to go to the Land of his Ancestors and, as a consequence, takeup that role which funnels power/ luck back towards the family of the living andhelps descendants make their way through life. The Gods, on the other hand, knewwhat lay in the future as an inevitability or, as stated in Chapter 2, which “lineageswere on a collision course with another,” but could only deal with the here-and-nowto help push it further forward into the future by working with the inhabitants ofMidgard to generate ̧orlög and keep the Flow of the Waters of Life in harmony withthe needs of the World Tree. The question “Where am I going to go after death?”does not ever come up in the eddaic or sagaic literature because each knew already,long before he died, his final destination. The question of uncertainty was and stillis a Christian phenomenon not a Heathen one.Judgement, after death, by the Gods is unnecessary in the Germanic worldviewand did not form part of the Heathen religion as far as can be ascertained. This isalso primarily a Christian concept. Sagaic and eddaic literature has many referencesto revenge being exacted on living men by the Gods, but this is for breaking a tabooassociated with a particular God. Glum in Viga-Glum’s Saga does not have a goodrelationship with Frey although He was the patron God of his community.“Throughout his adult career Glum was on bad terms with the God Freyr.To begin with, he slew an enemy on the cornfield, Vitazgjafi, and thus defiledit. The father of this man had no legal case, and was expelled from thedistrict. Before he left, he brought an ox to Freyr’s temple. The beastbellowed and fell dead, showing that the God had accepted the sacrifice andwould repay it.“Glum’s relations with Freyr grew worse as time wore on. He concealed hisoutlaw son, Vigfuss, within the sacred precincts of the temple. He emulatedÓðínn in swearing an ambiguous oath in three temples, one of which was thetemple of Freyr. Afterwards he had a strange dream. He saw Freyr sittingon a chair on the bank of the river, where many had come to visit Him.These were his dead kinsmen, who had come to intercede with the God onhis behalf. But Freyr answered abruptly and angrily, remembering the oxwhich Glum’s enemy had given Him. . . .He could no longer withstand hisenemies, and was driven from his lands in disgrace.”16Judgement, by the Gods, was exacted on the living, however, and not the dead. Theabove is one of many cases from the sagaic literature although the other cases arenot so clearly delineated nor so well described as this one. The form that revenge16Turville-Petre, p. 70."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky154usually took was loss of access to power/ luck, which in the above resulted in Glum’sloss of “a good name.”That the Gods were an objective reality, as opposed to internal or psychologicalconstructs, seems to have been the only way of viewing them if one held any conceptof them at all. The idea that Divine Powers are internal constructs seems to be amodern belief taken from interactions with Middle Eastern and Eastern philosophiessuch as Zen, Taoism, Sufism, or possibly some of the early Greek philosophies but didnot play any real part in the indigenous northern European spiritual philosophies.The way of the North seems to relate most closely aligned with what the Tibetanscall the “second Bardo” or the “realm of hallucination/ fantasies.” At present, theterm “hallucination” has the unfortunate connotation “experiencing something thatis not really there,” something not real. But, something is there: experience, partic-ularly, personal experience. Many cultures, including the modern American (in spiteof its negative view towards “hallucinations”), count personal experience as beingof great importance (seeing is believing). Even modern psychology tends to treatsome non-physical entities, such as “emotions,” as having an objective existence, i.e.outside the Self, so that they can be dealt with. The non- physical beings of theNorthern European worldview, such as elves, trolls, wood- sprites, etc., were alsodealt with objectively not because these people were ignorant, primitive barbarians,but, because in doing so, the universe was habitable, tolerable, and, in many cases,pleasant. Knowledge of the Gods, the World Tree, and the interactions between allforms of life, i.e., the entire Germanic world view, was a workable system and thatis all that counted .It is difficult to determine exactly who the inhabitants of the sky regions werefor the ancients. Both the Prose Edda of Snorri and the Poetic Edda indicate thatthe heavens were the realm of at least the Æsir (there is much evidence indicatingthat the Vanir were more closely associated with Midgard and the Underworld; seeChapter 5).17There are at least twelve “Halls” of the Gods listed by Snorri in the“Gylfaginning,” but Gladsheim is at one point called “the best [Hall] that is built onearth, and the biggest.” Njörðr, one of the Vanir and father to Freyr and Freyja,lives in Nóatún which is both in the heavens and near the ocean, and it is not veryclear whether this Hall is associated with his ancestry as one of the Vanir or withHis adopted ancestry as one of the Æsir.18Perhaps Snorri, writing 200 years afterthe official conversion of Iceland to Christianity, had his facts mixed up, or theremay be a completely different explanation.17H. R. is quite a heavy proponent of the idea that the Vanir, as well as the Álfar, are moreconcerned with the Underworld and Midgard. Indeed, her bookGods and Myths of NorthernEurope(Penguin Books; Middlesex, UK, 1964) seems to be almost completely devoted to thetopic.18Snorri, pp. 15-58."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky155The ancient peoples, and many Third World people even today, accepted theidea that the dream-state is nothing more than a continuation of the waking state(or vice-versa); that is, when people sleep and dream, they commit acts in theirdreams that they carry the responsibility for. Bente Alver in his essay “Concepts ofthe Soul in Norwegian Tradition” discusses two concepts of ancient soulcraft whichare related to the idea that dream and waking states were perceived to be on thesame continuum: the dream-soul and the free-soul.“In recent tradition, there is very little that can shed light on dream-concepts.But in ancient times, the dividing line between dream and reality was notas strong as it is now. It was believed that part of the alter-ego–we call itthe dream-soul–left the sleeper and experienced life outside. From personalexperience, people regarded dreams as experiences of the soul. Since therewas no threshold between the worlds, the soul could pass through the realmsof the living and the dead. As we know from our own experience, a dreamcan seem so real that we can reach out for someone long lost, and remain ina half-waking state, wistful because no one was there.”19The rules of Midgard (of consensus reality) do not apply to the realm of dreams orhallucinations: people can roam in the shapes of animals, non-physical beings exist,time and space are altered so that minutes can pass as days or weeks and miles canbe covered in the twinkling of an eye. The sky realm of the Gods appears to havebeen made of the same stuff that dreams are made of, but this, in itself, does notmake the experience any less real.Alver continues his discussion to show that the journeys made by the Lapp(Samí) shamans:“The activities of the shaman among the Same [sic] (Lapps) must haveadded weight to beliefs that certain people could obtain useful informationby the transmigration of the soul. But in tradition, the soul’s domain waslimited to the perceivable world, while the shaman’s soul travels everywhere.”20Alver feels that although it is true that there is not much material pertaining to theconcept of a free ranging soul in the sagaic or eddaic literature, the reason was notthat people did not have a knowledge of it, but that collectors of folklore have beenpoor at spotting and collecting it.The point here, then, is that what appears to be confusing descriptions of thesky realm and its inhabitants today may not have seemed so to the early Germanic19Alver, Bente ”Concepts of the Soul in Norwegian Tradition”inNordic Folklore: RecentStudiesRiemand Kvideland and H.

They may have simply accepted the conflicting information pertainingto the Land of the Gods as being no different than their own personal experiencesin the Land of the Ancestors during their dream-flights. Instability of physical laws(from consensus reality) governing space, time, mass, and energy is common to onetraveling in an altered state of consciousness.The question may then arise, “How can someone live in an altered state of con-sciousness, or accept obviously hallucinatory material as being on the same par asphysical reality, and still consider themselves to be in the here and now?” There areprobably a large variety of theoretical answers, but the facts remain: “They did andthey did.” In reality, the ancients did not live in an “altered state” but interpretedtheir world through a different worldview which included as fact much material thatis generally viewed as “fantasy” in the 20thcentury. Modern world views are nomore or no less fantasy than those of the ancients, however. Theories, themselves,for example, have no physical existence other than the fact that they seem to “work,”for the most part. Imagination, emotions, ideas, religions, philosophies, morality,democracy all have no physical existence which can be perceived by the humansensory system, yet all have their place in the modern worldview. Is there reallyany difference between an ancient Scandinavian dreaming that Óðínn has providedhim with the skills necessary for a sea voyage or Francis Crick dreaming that twosnakes are fighting which became the basis for the discovery of the genetic materialcalled DNA? It is truly amazing how little people have changed over the past twomillennia.Who lived in the sky realm? Because of conflicting information from the Sagas,the Eddas, and folklore, it is difficult to say for certain. The Æsir appear to havebeen the primary inhabitants, and their abode or abodes, depending on whetherone is talking about Asgard, the city, or the individual Halls of the Gods andGoddesses, seems to have been located far to the north. Certain ancestors whohave died in battle or through the shedding of their blood, i.e., murder, and thesewere called the Einherjar.21Their doom was to fight one another each day andto be renewed each night. The red aurora borealis is supposed to have been theEinherjar engaged in practice battle in preparation for the final battle at the end oftime, the Ragnarök, and, apparently, because of the rule of reciprocity, nighttime onMidgard was reversed daytime in Asgard. Sturluson mentions that the light-elveslived in the “second” heaven far to the south and above, called Andlangr,22and in the“third” heaven, called Viðbláinn.23There were also animals mentioned as belonging21See Chapter 4, Sky Connection, which discusses the possibility that Asgard may haveactually been on the northern horizon as opposed to \"up in the sky.\"22Faulkes,Prose Edda, p. 2023Faulkes,Prose Edda, p. 20."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Chapter 6.

Allthe literature seems to indicate is that all these beings live outside the realm of theliving.Over the centuries, scholars have attempted many different illustrations of whatthe sky realm must look like, but all fall short. In Lost Beliefs of Northern Europe,Davidson remarks that “those who have tried to produce a convincing diagram ofthe Scandinavian cosmos from what we are told in the sources have only added tothe confusion .” Some have tried to assign the twelve Halls of the Gods as describedby Snorri to the twelve houses of the zodiac, and others have tried to actuallycreate a map of Asgard, but the depictions never really work out. According to thedescriptions in the eddaic and the sagaic literature, the high number of paradoxes,which were acceptable to the ancient Germanic peoples, indicate that humans whileresiding inside the physical limitations of their bodies were completely incapable ofunderstanding the make-up of either the sky realm or the Underworld, but that byslipping outside their bodies either during sleep or during the soul-journey of thenoaide, the imagery of these realms became quite comprehensible. Pictures of sucha world can never be drawn, only experienced.The Halls of the Gods seem to have been thought of as lying to the North orthe West in the general directions also reserved for the Hel-journey of souls. Thedirection of East is where the giants lived, many of whom changed their allegiancefrom Jötunheim, the Land of the Giants, to Ásaheim, the Land of the Gods. Thus,in the “Gylfaginning” and in the “Ynglingasaga,” Snorri implies that the Æsir camefrom east of the Don River (Danube) and that the original home of the Vanir wasaround the mouth of the Danube which empties into the Black Sea. The originalcity founded by and home to the Æsir, Asgard, lay to the east of the Vanir (185).After a lengthy period of time, after the Great War between the Æsir and the Vanir,there was an overall migration of the Gods to the North and West:“And because Odhin [sic] had the gift of prophecy and was skilled inmagic, he knew that his offspring would inhabit the northern part of theworld. Then he set his brothers, Ve and Vili over Asgarth, but he himself andall diar (chiefs), and many other people, departed. First, he journeyed westto Garthariki Russia, and then south, to Saxland Northwestern Germany. Hehad many sons. He took possession of lands far and wide in Saxland and sethis sons to defend these lands. Then he journeyed north to the sea and fixedhis abode on an island. That place is now called Othinsey Odhin’s Island,on the island of Funen.” (186)"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky158From here, Óðínn and his followers continued to move to the north where Snorritells us in the “Ynglingasaga” that he initially settled around Sweden and easternNorway.If one understands the piece of folk knowledge that the aurora borealis is con-nected with the daily battling of the Einherjar, which covers the northern hemisphereof the sky at night in the North lands, then the final “home” of the Æsir is to theNorth and the water loving Vanir settled to the West. In reading the sagaic andeddaic literature, however, one gets the feeling that it was not the actual locationof the “homes” of the Gods and Goddesses that were important, but the directions.Thus, the East and the South were where both men and Gods went to “battle theenemy.” In several of the eddaic poems, Þór is quoted to have been “off to theEast” doing battle with the inhabitants of Jötunheim, and, of course, to the Southlay Muspell from where the sons of Surt would come for the final battle at theend of time, the Ragnarök. The compass directions and their significance to theancient Germanic spiritual philosophy and world view have already been dealt within preceding chapters.The sky realm, according to the above descriptions seems to have been prettymuch a reflection of the Underworld except that in the sky realm lived the Godsand only a few ancestors whereas in the Underworld lived the largest percentageof the ancestors and few Gods or Goddesses being restricted to the Vanir and theGoddess of the Underworld. Jötunheim appears to have extended across all threeworlds and the homes of the Gods apparently being near the northern and westernhorizons where the three worlds come together. The large expanse overhead as couldbe viewed from Midgard is the field where the lives of the Gods were played out, andthe effects of Their actions were rained down upon the earth. The winds, weather,the seasonal giants (Summer and Winter), the giants of time (Day, Night, Dawn),and the various luminaries (the stars, Sunna, Máni, Bil and Hjúki) all entered intothe sky field and let their effects fall into Mannheim from their respective directions(187)It was from the sky realm that fell the “poet’s draught” from Óðínn’s mouthwhile in the shape of an eagle, the contents of the cauldron, óðroerir, after He stoleit back from Suttung the Giant. Honeydew fell from the antlers of Eikþyrnir. Therumble of Þór’s chariot was heard rolling across the skies as He protected Midgardfrom the onslaught of the frost giants (188). Óðínn and His followers, the Einherjar,roared through the night sky dooming those to be caught up in the Wild Hunt’sendless battle- frenzy and to be forever kept from a final home in the Land of theAncestors. From the skies came luck, power and guidance (in the form of omens),on the one hand, and madness or death on the other.Christianity brought with it many changes, especially in philosophy regarding"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky159the Afterlife. Prior to the coming of Christianity to the North, the concept of anAfterlife was basically a continuation of life on Midgard among the Ancestors withthe exception of some very special circumstances, either in the case of a violent deathas mentioned earlier or in the case of a great king/ military leader. Informationcollected from various sources such as archeological finds, written documents ofrecorded burial customs, anecdotal information from family sagas as well as from theeddaic poetry all indicate that the concept of Valhalla being the “warrior’s paradise”is most likely late in origin and may have even been influenced by the Christianpreaching of “going to sit at the right hand of the Father.” In fact, Valhalla in itsform as the Hall of the Slain may have originally been conceived as being connectedto the Hall of Hel with only the daily battlegrounds being in the sky realm.24Even in this day and age, however, the concept that those making the journeyto the Land of the Dead are not on their way to live in the Halls of their Gods isnot so strange. What makes it difficult for many to understand is that the westerncivilizations have been so indoctrinated by pop-Christianity that they can no longerunderstand the function of the Gods and the role that They play in the Universe.Ego-centric philosophy has led many to believe that Gods or divine powers existonly for the sole entertainment of Their worshipers. This type of philosophy doesnot yet exist in many Third World countries (190, 191, 192).The ancient Gods did not often deal with individuals (with the exception ofÓðínn) but dealt with the welfare of entire communities. For the ancient Germanicpeoples, individual help, wisdom, gifts, luck, power, etc. came primarily from theAncestors and from each individual’s dealings with other lineages upon Midgard.The Gods did not often interfere with an individual’s life because Their main concernwas the well-being of Yggdrasil and the staving off of the Ragnarök until as far intothe future as possible . The community system of the sky-realm was for the Godsto gather in council each day and to decide upon the organization or reorganizationof the homes within the World Tree. Snorri described this court only briefly:“The third root of the ash extends to heaven, and beneath that root is awell which is very holy, called Weird’s [sic] Well. There the Gods have theircourt. Everyday the Æsir ride there up over Bifröst. It is also called As-bridge. . . . And Thór walks (as opposed to horseback) to the court and wades riverswhose names are: Kormt and Ormt and two Kerlaugs, these shall Thór wadeeveryday when He is to judge at the Ash Yggdrasil, for As-bridge burns allwith flame, the holy waters boil.”2524The reader is referred to H.

The Sky160The poems in theElder Eddadescribe many exploits of the Gods but very few ofthese have anything to do with individuals. Óðínn, the chief of the Æsir, does inter-fere with the lives of individuals but mostly as warriors, and He was not generallytrusted to act on the behalf of the individual so much as to gain worthy, well-testedwarriors and battle-chiefs for his band of Einherjar in preparation for the Battle atthe End of Time. The Viking Age was a turbulent time and it must often been seenwhat unlikely chances swayed the outcome of battle. The unpredictable in war wasattributed to Óðínn, the fickle God who had his favorites but did not keep themforever: He was openly regarded as One whose oath could not be trusted. Poets andthinkers in the tenth century found an answer presented by Óðínn’s unpredictability.There was one event that Óðínn could foresee but not prevent: the destined threatto the order of Yggdrasil maintained by the Gods, like the destined death of everyindividual, was bound to come. The monsters kept at bay were only biding theirtime and their attack was in real prospect. In the poem called the “Eiríksmál,”composed sometime after 950 CE, Óðínn in Valhalla“is asked why he deprived King Eirík of victory, seeing He thought himvaliant: ’Because it is hard to know for certain,’ said Óðínn–’the gray wolflooks at the home of the Gods.’ So Óðínn gathers dead warriors and thecream of men–bitter and unjust their defeat–because He must collect Hishost for battle.”26Foote and Wilson obviously consider the above statement to be an excuse createdby the “thinkers of the tenth century” for the impersonal actions of Óðínn takentowards individuals in battle apparently basing their opinion on the age of thepoem the “Eiríksmál.” However, it is not so improbable that the belief existed longbefore the 10th century and did not only pertain to Óðínn.The nature of worship of the Gods in pre-Christian times appears to have beenprimarily communal although there probably were certain rites conducted by fam-ilies to bring favor and fertility to the land-holding. Families were more likely toinvoke the aid of more localized deities rather than of the Æsir and Vanir, however(see Chap. 3 for the relationship between the Vanir and the álfar). There is no clearevidence in any of the eddaic or sagaic literature that any of the Gods were everviewed as being “personal saviors” in the sense that Jesus is thought to be. Certainmembers within a community were considered both by themselves and by the othermembers of the community to be “the friend” of a particular God as mentionedearlier, but this relationship between a man or a woman and a God appears tohave been more like that between a king and a royal representative to a region of26Foote, P.

The individual indeed may have enjoyed certain privileges provided bythe God whom he represented but in terms that would benefit the entire communityin short and the overall functioning of the World Tree in the long run.Again the ancient Germanic view of individuality resurfaces. A person was anindividual only as he or she fit into a lineage, a family, a community, a nation,Midgard and, finally, the Tree itself like a series of concentric circles with the centerbeing the realm of personal experience or the point from which perception originated.Each had roles and responsibilities to play out within each of the circles. The “force”of an act diminished the further from the point of the act’s origin with the effectsof the most powerful lineages being felt in ever wider circles (see Chap. 2). Therelationship between an individual and a God, then, was from the very center of aset of these concentric circles to the outermost circle, and, like throwing a rock intothe center of a lake, for the reverberation of an individual to be felt by the Gods, anact would have had to have been very powerful indeed with perhaps only the actsof kings, powerful leaders, and great warriors or entire communities being the mosteffective.There are many speculations by scholars as to why Christianity was acceptedin northern Europe, and many of them have been mentioned to some degree inthe preceding chapters. None of the theories cover all the bases, but they all haveone thing in common: Christianity offered a way for the status of an individual tobe raised to its highest possible level. No longer did a person have to suffer thesupposed indignity of being an insignificant cog/ individual within the workings ofa very large machine/ community; he or she could have a direct line of access to thewidest of the concentric circles but only by accepting the White Christ. In essence,by accepting the new God, even thralls (slaves) could view themselves on par withkings.Christianity had something to offer to everyone. It did not acknowledge slavery,so in Christian eyes at least slaves were essentially freed men. The large populationof peasants (bonded servants) were offered individual salvation. Kings were offeredpolitical power which through alliances with other Christian kings increased theirpolitical influence from being the king of a small regional kingdom to somethingmore akin to an emperor. Even though Christianity was supposed to be primarilya spiritual movement,“it is likely that political as well as religious considerations were significantin determining whether a leader received Christianity and whether he couldinduce his followers to agree. Cnut the Great is an obvious example of agreat Viking ruler who recognized that political success would depend on his"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky162acceptance by Christian rulers abroad, which in turn required him to confirmhis own Christian faith.”27Kings who were determined to widen their influence of political power also dependedgreatly on how many followers they could collect who were sympathetic to “thecause,” and this seems to have been a primary rationale for the often bloody baptismsthat are recorded in many of the sagas of kings.Always preaching the religious and spiritual aspects of Christianity, newly Chris-tianized kings marched through the north gaining converts and ever-widening theircause. The “cause” of King Ólaf, for example, was to become the king of a unitedNorway, and to this end, he brought the new religion to the ignorant farmers of theinterior of Norway, those who were most isolated from the influences of both politicsand new religious practices.“He investigated how Christianity was being kept, and when he consideredthat there was need of improvement, he taught them the right faith. Andhe laid stress on it that if he found anyone who did not want to abandonHeathendom, he drove him out of the land. Some he had maimed, havingtheir hands or feet lopped off or their eyes gouged out, others he had hangedor beheaded, but left no one unchastised who refused to serve God. And thushe proceeded in all that district (Uppland). Always he punished both themighty and the humble.”28Apparently, the benefits of accepting the new faith were not always obvious toprospective converts and some demonstration of the power of God was necessary tohelp convince those who were reluctant to completely change their worldview.This new worldview offered mankind a different way to gain a sense of selfsatisfaction through the Christian teaching of equality in the eyes of God, butego-centrism and narcissism have their costs. True, on the surface, the Asa-faithappeared disorganized and non-temporal as far as the stories of the Gods were con-cerned, but from that disorganization came a sense of belonging through well-definedroles within a family and a community. Christianity offered a text, the Bible, anda world view, which were very well-organized, but Christian philosophy left thedefinition of man’s role up to individual interpretation. Certainly, the new religionallowed for a sense of equality and humaneness in what seemed to be an otherwiseunfair, uncaring world, but conversely some of the bloodiest wars in the history ofmankind have been fought defending these individual interpretations.“And here of course we have the great contradiction at the heart of Chris-tianity, a religion which in action denies the faith it confesses verbally: Jesus’27Page, R.

Thestatues of St. Paul which I have seen in the Mediterranean lands, with theOld Testament under one arm and a long sword in the other, date from alater age and a time when the zeal to convert others had grown so strong andthe faith so fanatical that Christians had completely forgotten Jesus’ owndoctrine of love and respect for the lives of others. It was their intolerancethat caused the sanguinary wars of religion. How many lives have not beensacrificed to fanaticism!”29So, while offering mankind a way to feel wonderful about itself, the new religion alsodid much to destroy the sense ofbelongingto this world, the sense of belonging toa community in Midgard. A bonded man after the conversion no longerbelongedtoa farm or a community; he was connected solely and with a direct line (through thechurch) to an omnipotent God. Individualism in its modern sense, then, naturallybrings with it the feelings of isolation and alienation which brings the entire pointof all the preceding chapters back to the idea that people have lost their sense ofconnectedness.The ancient Germanic spiritual philosophy has much to offer modern folk, but thesocial and political forces being utilized circa 950 CE are still present, even today, inthe form of social, religious, and political propaganda against any worldview whichis believed to stand in direct opposition to the status quo. People continue to beharassed, tortured, and sometimes even killed because they see the world in a waywhich differs from the so-called norm.However, it should also be noted that most of these martyrs have also beenvery vocal in their opposition to the current worldview, and their vocal oppositionwas interpreted as a threat to the prevailing Christian masses or to specific indi-viduals. Acceptance of the Northern Germanic spiritual philosophy as practicedby the northern European forebears does not require any overt acts of opposition;in fact, direct confrontation based on philosophical or religious differences wouldactually run counter to the Heathen concept that the “community” is more im-portant that the individual. The earliest settlers of Heathen Iceland accepted andtolerated Christians as viable members of the community. Intolerance was and stillis a part of the Christian world view regardless of how politically correct the Bibleis interpreted, and this intolerance has spread to other, non-Christian, groups eitherthrough association or simply by the fact that it is commonplace. The westernhemisphere is, after all, 50-80% Christian even in this age of atheists and agnostics.29Moberg, VilhelmA History of the Swedish People(Dorset Press; New York, NY) 1970, vol.1, p. 84."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky164The ancients accepted that all individuals were part of a whole system. Thesky-realm, for them, consisted of two tribes of Gods who were able to overcome theirhostility towards each other through negotiation, so that each tribe eventually couldsee that there was a greater cause: the preservation of the World Tree. What wasinitially a struggle between different worldviews became a concerted effort towardsmaintaining the wholeness/ health/ holiness of Yggdrasil. The individual persongained honor and respect by how much he could give to the community, communitiesworked together under a king. They understood the power of cooperation in spiteof individual differences.Early Teutons maintained a strong sense of family, but in the 20thcenturythis has been replaced by the highly mobile “2.8-kids-nuclear-family. Althoughthere are advantages to being highly mobile in terms of material goods, access-ability of job opportunities, etc., there are also some serious drawbacks in thesocial-emotional-spiritual realm.“There is no doubt that an individual (during the Viking Age) was less aseparate being and more a limb of a larger organism, the whole family, thanhe is today. His responses would automatically tend to put the well-being ofthe family first. That demanded the maintenance of the integrity of familyproperty and of the corporate standing of the family in the community. Profitand loss, honor and shame were all shared, and common efforts were requiredto achieve the good and blot out the bad. As well as sharing in communalreligious observances, the family nucleus usually also took private steps toensure divine favour. There were many divinities and there was ritual toobserve at both public and domestic festivals, but there was no compulsionfor an individual to establish personal relations with the Gods.”30Because of the passing away of the family lands and the viral industrialization ofwestern society, the concept of the extended family is little more than a quaintanarchronism, but the “need” of a family-like support is as important today as itever was.A common 20thcentury malady is the feeling of isolation and with this comesfeelings of loneliness, lack of support, dissociation, and alienation. In general, thecure for this disease is for the individual to refocus his self-absorbed attention outsidehimself, out toward others within the environment/ community, and to begin to viewhimself as a part of a system. Constant struggling for personal salvation, “gettingwhat one deserves,” personal rights, etc. is doomed to failure without communitysupport. The “support group” phenomenon which has infectiously invaded the fieldof counseling has been, essentially, an attempt to create small micro-communities in30P. G. Foote and D. M.

Neighborhood Associations and Neighborhood Watch programs as well as thereturn to community-based sports and the long gone ”beat-cop” are approaches thatsome communities have taken on themselves.The modern world is only slowly beginning to realize the part of the ancientspiritual philosophy that states that “man is meaningless without a community.”One of the most severe punishments for the ancient Germanic peoples was thatof “outlawry,” legally cutting a man off from home and community, yet with themodern worldview, all individuals are subjected to outlawry by the simple fact ofbeing born.Another aspect of community is now slowly beginning to take foothold, at least inAmerica. Although the concept of communal grazing and farming lands is long gone,many American cities have revised and updated the concept in the forms of Boule-vard Median Adoption Programs, Community Owned Parks, Highway AdoptionPrograms, and Beautification Projects. True, there are processes at work outsidehuman control like natural disasters, for example, but human beings are the oneswho can affect the lineage of a geographical area and help it to come back into thewholeness/ health/ holiness of the entire system. Human effort, according to theancient Germanic spiritual principles, is to imitate the Powers of the sky-realm. Asthe Germanic deities strove with combined effort to nurture the Universal homeagainst the forces of destruction, so communities strove together to maintain theirlands against the destructive forces of both nature and mankind. The purpose of thefall slaughter of grazing animals was, in part, to prevent over-grazing of the landsduring the summer season. Concern about the health and well-being of the farm-lands can be seen in theAcre-botdiscussed in Chapter 3. Acceptance of the ancientGermanic spiritual philosophy requires a willingness to participate in community inone form or another.According to this ancient philosophy, personal responsibility and communityresponsibility for acts committed are absolutely crucial, and the idea still holdsbecause it is at the very foundation of community-building and maintenance. Toooften federal or state governments are expected to “chip in” when a community itselfis to blame for littered highways, graffiti-laden walls, or toxic waste in the water.Fines are often paid to the courts or a jail sentence is commuted while responsibilityby the perpetrator to the victim is overlooked.

The Sky16620thcentury, folks are simply looking for money to grab as opposed to bringing anunwholesome state back into a sense of wholeness.On the other hand some communities have sold themselves into slavery by grab-bing for Andvari’s Gold. They bring in businesses, manufacturing firms and govern-ment deals looking to increase the value of their own meager holdings only to findthat twenty years down the line they have lost all control and rights. Entire townshave lost water rights, mineral rights, land rights, and access rights—all passed overto mega-businesses and governmental agencies to increase the value of property by afew points. To the ancient Germanic peoples, stewardship over family land-holdingswas considered a sacred duty; gold and cattle were the mobile forms of money, butman without land was a slave. In this sense, the western hemisphere is filled withslaves, as well as outlaws.There is an Anglo-Saxon saying that goes “Plan as if you are going to live forever,but work as if you are going to die tomorrow.” In other words, ”Don’t do anythingtoday that you or your decedents might regret somewhere down the line.”31Ger-manic mythology is filled with such tales of rash decisions which needed amending.Often such tales were intended to be somewhat humorous and most often resultedin the individual God’s (usually Loki, the mischief-maker) taking responsibility forthe act committed. For the ancient Germanic peoples,“taking responsibility” wasconsidered to be an honorable act. Adam of Bremen in describing the Danes ofSjælland said that“if they are caught in crimes affecting the royal interest or other wrong-doing, [they] would rather lose their heads than their hides. No kind ofpunishment is found there other than the axe and enslavement; and whena man is condemned, then to be cheerful is an honor. For the Danes soabominate tears and lamentation and other kinds of sorrow, which we countsalutary, that a man is allowed to weep neither for his sins nor for the deadwho were dear to him.”32It should be noted that “tears and lamentation” were not unknown; even the God-dess, Freyja, lamented the loss of Her husband, Óð, and all things shed tears at thedeath of Balder, the son of Óðínn, with the exception of Þökk, a cave-dwelling giant-ess, who, at the time of Snorri, was presumed to be Loki. But, taking responsibilitywas considered to be honorable, a sacred duty, and tears were not to be shed.31The modern version might go something like this: ”Plan as quickly as possible, work likeyou are going to live forever, and when the inevitable foul-ups occur (as they will, due to poorplanning), either do a patch job or fudge the data at the end of the project.” We tend to skimp onplanning these days and spend millions of dollars in man-hours fixing up botched jobs. Somehowwe are made to feel that this is acceptable.32P. G. Foote and D. M. Wilson, p. 18."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The Sky167The word “worship” in its modern sense has taken on the meaning “one givingabsolute devotion to,” and, over the years, it has also picked up the flavor of the firstCommandment as written in the Old Testament of ”above all others.” The wordis actually from the OEweorth-scipewhich literally meant “the act of honoring”or “honoring the worth of” something. So to say, for example, that the ancientTeutons “worshiped” their ancestors would be true in this older sense since theyhonored them through funeral rites andminne-alesor “memorial feasts.” There isno reason to believe that they treated their Gods any differently since their Gods,although powerful, were not infallible and were subject to the same forces flowingout of the Well of Urð as men were. But, because they were powerful, they ruledover the forces of nature which provided the cyclical movement of the seasons, andthey had gifted humankind not only with life, but also lineage, luck, and a sense ofart and beauty, They wereworthyof feasts in their honor.In this modern age, man would do well to pick up the practice ofweorth-scipe,honoring, of those forces outside his realm of control as the products and effects of aPower or Powers outside of himself. Modern folk greatly lack any sense of gratitudefor simple things with the exception of money and material possessions. A gift ofmoney or a new job opportunity is certainly something to be grateful for, but thereality is that each individual participates in a world which moves through time andspace providing that person with an endless stream of events and an endless stringof opportunities for both participation and personal growth. The American secularholiday of Thanksgiving was initially intended to serve the purpose of “feasting tohonor those things,” but some of the meaning has been lost over the past 50 years.A revival of this holiday with its original meaning would serve the purpose well. Inessence, the ancient Germanic peoples, according to Snorri, had three such annualholidays on a large scale where communities or groups of communities would gatherfor a “grand Thanksgiving,” and, according to some of the sagaic sources, familiesalso engaged in this practice at home both during and in between the nationalholidays.Showing gratitude is one of the best ways that individuals or groups can alignthemselves with those Powers that are unseen but whose effects can be felt at anysingle given moment. Nothing needs to be asked for. Gratitude draws the attentionmomentarily away from the self, to the great mysterious forces outside the self, andthis is something that anyone can benefit from. People have become self-absorbed,ego-centric, and, as stated in Chapter 2, many consider this to be the root of physicaland psychological illnesses which seem to plague modern man.

The Sky168Worshiping and showing gratitude are ways in which modern folk can pick upand participate in the spiritual philosophy of the ancient northern Europeans. “Par-ticipation” is a key concept here. Over the past millennium people have come tothink of themselves as being in control and have striven to ever gain more and morecontrol over their lives, but to do so they have had to sink deeper into a pool ofillusion. The ancients understood that events came from the outside and the onlyreal control that any individual has ever had is in his or her own responses to theevents as they unfold. True, through participation in life people are able to changeevents to some degree, but the results of their actions fall back into the Well ofUrð. While the movement of an Andean butterfly’s wings may eventually result ina storm over China, there are many intervening factors which make the connectionseem implausible and totally unpredictable for the observer of the butterfly. Thebest that anyone can do is to engage inweorth-scipeand to offer a gift of gratitudeto those larger Powers out there, and by doing so, better align himself with thosePowers. These actions result in power/ luck flowing toward the individual, family,or community.

But, even if only the reader’s life changes for the better then the effortof this writing has been of some worth.Unlike the information in the preceding chapters which was presented as objec-tively as possible, much of the information contained in this chapter is subjectivein its presentation. It is an introduction to how the Germanic worldview can besynthesized and put into practice and is based, naturally, in the personal experienceof a growing number of people including the author himself. Readers are free tointerpret as they wish, creating approaches of their own, but this chapter comesdirectly from the author’s personal experience and the experience of others on thesame or a similar journey, and, consequently, should be tried as it is presented beforechanges or additions get made.This system as it is presented is aboutexperienceas opposed totheory.Simplyreading the material that follows does nothing. The “armchair expert” is a modernphenomenon, and, unfortunately, it has become the standard mode of action formany people. Although there is much material here for the armchair expert, it isadvisable that once a reader has finished with the armchair part of the experience ofthis worldview, the exercises in the next several chapters be attempted in physical,consensus reality. The collective experience of this author and others have shownthis method to be of greatest benefit. The reader should, at least, give it a chancebefore making alterations for changes made based onreal experienceare truly thebest method.Readingabout farming is a far cry from actually having farmed, andhaving a flower garden is not the same as making a living from the soil!This chapter is also about choices both voluntary and forced. Some may simplychoose to add to their already existent worldview, broadening their knowledge baseof the cultures and practices of the world, ancient and modern; some may feelcompelled or driven to find and accept a suitable worldview because theirs is eitherfailing or is not broad enough in scope; and some, as was the case with this author,may feel that there is no longer a viable set of choices and are, consequently, leftwith only one if they are to continue as part of this world. Whatever the case maybe, choices are available, and they are always personal ones.According to the Germanic worldview, one lives by accessing power/ luck fromthe Flow of the Waters of Life, and knowledge, wisdom, or cunning is based on aninternalized understanding of the World Tree (space) and its currents (time).

At the Well of Urð171end. Knowledge or wisdom, on the other hand, is an understanding of the Tree/Waters complex resulting in right action which eventually allows one to enter intothe flow of power/ luck. Intelligence is of some importance, but the fact is thatthere are many of great intelligence who are completely incapable of acting out ofknowledge or wisdom. “Cunning” is not synonymous with “knowledge” or “wisdom.”“Cunning” is the ability to create proper or improper action based on knowledge.Often the term is given negative connotations as in “cunning as a fox.” For example,notice the slight change in tone between a “cunning grin” and a “knowing smile.”However, etymologically, the word is closely related to the word “to know” and hasa cognate in modern Germankennen(“to know”). “Cunning” is used throughoutthis text in its neutral form rather than its pejorative. “Cunning” is to “knowledge”as “intelligence” is to “information.”In such a worldview as is presented here, there are three ways in which one canaccess knowledge:1. through ritual or ritualized behavior,2. through divination, and3. through the practice of seið or Whole-making.These are very broad categories with much overlap, and they are somewhat arbitraryhaving no existence in reality other than the simplifying of the presentation of thismaterial for this book.The first category can be defined as “actingto access knowledge.” Knowledge isthe internalized understanding of the Tree/ Waters complex and ritual or ritualizedbehavior provides the action so to result in access of power/ luck. By acting inspecific ways, utilizing guidelines such as theHávamálor the spiritual philosophyas outlined in the preceding chapters, access to the Flow of the Waters is assuredlyincreased.Occasionally, one might recoil at the thought of engaging in ritualized behavior,but it is common practice and, at some level, instinctive to all animals includinghumans. It has evolved simply because it increases the chances of success. Theanimalistic behaviors of “grooming” and “mating ritual” are human behaviors theworld over because they increase the chance of perpetuating human life, they im-prove the quality of life, and they feel very pleasant to the human nervous system.Non-instinctive ritualized behaviors also function to improve one’s lot in life. “Beingpolite,” for example, is a social lubricant for easing tension between people, is veryritualized in nature (always say “please” and “thank you”), and increases the possi-bility of success, and increasing possibilities is all one can hope for since there areno guarantees. So, no matter how one may initially respond to the idea of ritualizedbehavior, the fact is that it works more often than not."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð172This method for accessing knowledge does not require that anyone hold anyparticular set of religious beliefs or hold any beliefs at all, for that matter. It issimply a way of changing behavior so that one is acting “in accordance” with the flowof power/ luck which moves up out of the Ginnungagap, through the Underworld,and out onto Midgard. Secondly, it has historical precedence: ritualized behaviorsas outlined in theHávamálwere practiced for almost half a millennium before someof them began to slowly be replaced by ideas brought in from outside the Germanicrealm.TheHávamálliterally translates as “The Sayings of Har,” andHaris one of theepithets for Óðínn, Chief of the Æsir. This name does not, and apparently neverdid, imply that this collection of strophes was composed by Óðínn, but implies thatthis set of guidelines led one to “act” in accordance with knowledge. R. I.

Some of the strophes do have somewhat of a cynical tone, but whenone considers the importance of lineage in friendship, the access to power/ luck isgreatest when the lineages support one another (see Chap. 2).Adam of Bremen, a canon of the cathedral church in Bremen during the latterhalf of the 11th century, remarked on the human qualities of the Heathen northernersin hisDiscriptio insularum aquilonis.“Though all northerners are noted for their hospitality, our Swedes aresupreme. To them worse than any infamy is to deny hospitality to travelers,so there is rivalry or competition as to which of them shall have the honorof entertaining a guest. To him they extend all the humane courtesies foras many days as he wants to remain there, and they take to their friends intheir various homes. Good things like this are part of their customs . . . .”4Although it should be stated that Adam of Bremen was equally unimpressed bysome of their other customs since they were Heathen and he was a representative ofthe Church, his opinion of their treatment of him, not only as a stranger but as aman of a different religion, was high.

Hospitality at that time meant that we didn’t lock our doors when we went onvacation just in case someone might need something from the house. Borrowing andhelping out a neighbor were done as a matter of course. When someone ”broke therules” as would happen occasionally, the cold shoulder treatment by the rest of thecommunity was enough to bring the individual back in line.

The movement has grown and coalesced into the so-called New Age whichis really little more than a “crazy-quilt” built of scraps and pieces taken from all cul-tures and sources. Anglo-Europeans are often those who seem to be most affectedby this phenomenon because this are the people who have allowed themselves tobecome grossly separated from their cultural spiritual values and, because of this,many have either joined together with practitioners of non-Anglo-European indige-nous earth-based cultures (those who have not become separated from their ancestralvalue systems) or have started new philosophies/ religions. There is much positive tobe said about these groups, way too much for this book, but they lack one thing: acohesive ancestral spiritual philosophy which has its base in Anglo-European ances-try, the ancestral worldview of northern Europe from where most stem. In general,these people are merely reacting against the Christianity and Christian values that"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð175they had known while growing up. They fail to realize that they don’t have to makethings up as they go along; they can reclaim their own ancestral philosophy whichcould not only provide them with a cohesive and workable value system but a senseof history and historical pride as well.Those wishing to “find their roots” in an earth-based religion might do well tolook in their own backyard.“To moot a man should ride washed and fedEven if he is not well dressed.No man should be ashamed of boots or breeches,Nor even of a horse that’s no good”5There is an integrity and a sense of comfort in being able to embrace one’s ownancestral values even though they might not look as pretty as some others on thesurface. No one needs to “look good” for “by his actions will the man be known.”Since the late 1950’s, there has been a move to restore various Heathen reli-gions of northern and eastern Europe as accurately as possible. This appears tohave been an off-shoot of the appearance of the earth-based religions á la Frazer/Robert Graves, particularly a branch known as Wicca started in its modern formby Gerald B. Gardner. These “restored” religions started with Druidism and CelticChristianity, but now includes Romuva (Slavic), Hellenism (Greek), and the ÁsaFaith (Germanic), plus a variety of smaller groups. Most of these groups haveattempted to reconstruct the ancient religions as accurately as possible basing theirinformation on literature, court records, archeology, and folklore both ancient andmodern, utilizing comparative approaches similar to those used in this book.The Ása Faith, or Ásatrú as it is called in America (Odinism, Vanatrú or theNorthern Way), appears to have begun in its most current regeneration in the early1970’s, and although its membership is still relatively small in numbers, it has growninto an international organization and continues to attract members at a slow evenpace. Some of the groups have attracted members also associated with neo-Nazismwhile others, in an attempt to “clean up” the Germanic image, are very vocal aboutbeing opposed to any kind of intolerance based on “ethnicity, creed, color, sexualpreference, or any other divisive criteria,” to use their own words. There are at leasttwo dozen regional councils in the United States alone.These organizations stress the reconstructed religious aspects of ancient Teutonicpeoples as well as the practice of spiritual values of everyday life.

Accessing knowledge directly is anarduous path requiring sacrifices that many are not willing or are unable to make;this path will be discussed in greater detail below. But, engaging in proper action,i.e. those actions which are of maximum benefit to all, has the effect of bringingquality to life. One can eat in a healthy fashion, a take care of the body withonly minimal knowledge of medical or dietary sciences, so it goes with acting in aspiritual manner to maintain spiritual health.There are ways to access knowledge, albeit in a slightly indirect fashion throughthe use of symbols, without having to engage in years of sacrifice and strenuoussearching: the Germanic forms of divination. There may have originally been manyforms of divination practiced by the ancient Germanic peoples, but only a smallhandful have been passed down through the lines of folklore. The main forms ofdivination as of the 20th century are omens or “lucky-signs” (ONheill= “omensof luck”) and the “reconstructed” reading of runes. The third method is not oftenthought of as divination but is more a way to “change luck” through minimal action:hex-signs and songs or charms.Divination, in the old Germanic sense, is like throwing small objects into theWell of Urð and watching the patterns that form. Unlike many other forms ofdivination in use around the world which purport to read the future, the Germanicforms read only the present or the past. Anciently, divination was used to glimpse asituation in a broader scope than what would normally be possible so that changescould be made as necessary. “Reading-the-future” is inconsistent with the Germanicworldview. For many of the modern reconstructionists, divination is considered tobe “reading the waters in the Well of Urð” or as it is usually called, the Well ofWyrd.6The Germanic idea of reading omens is a very complex lore involving much timeout in nature. An omen or a lucky-sign is an object, animal, bird, fish or plantthat is situated in a background in such a way that it carries some kind of meaningfor an individual. Modern psychology has been using various oracles for years fordetermining the unconscious or subconsciousstatus quo.It is interesting that somesciences have taken up the use of divination, particularly theI Ching, for the samereasons that the Germanic peoples did: to read the present.“But what significance has such ‘fortune telling’ for our own time? Eventhose who accept the idea that theI Chingis a storehouse of wisdom will6See Edred Thorsson’sAt the Well of Wyrd(Samuel Weiser, New York, NY) 1988."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð177find it hard to believe that consultation of the oracle is anything more thanan experiment in the occult. It is indeed difficult to grasp that more isinvolved, for the ordinary person today consciously dismisses all diviningtechniques as archaic nonsense. Yet they are not nonsense. As Dr. Jung hasshown, they are based on what he calls the ‘principle of synchronicity’ (or,more simply, meaningful coincidence) . . . . It is based on the assumption ofan inner unconscious knowledge that links a physical event with a psychiccondition, so that a certain event that appears ‘accidental’ or ’coincidental’can in fact be physically meaningful; and its meaning is often symbolicallyindicated through dreams that coincide with the event.”7In essence, Ms. Jacobi is saying that the use of a divination system helps people tolook a little more closely at their lives, to notice, maybe, a couple of events whichare unfolding at the moment and which do not appear to be related, and by bringingthese events together in the mind, they are able to plan a course of action whichis in harmony with the rest of the world. The reading of omens functions prettymuch the same way as does theI Ching, the only differences being that there is nota consistent method for interpretation, and the signs are read directly from natureas opposed to throwing coins to create “signs.”There is no clear cut Germanic system for reading or interpreting lucky-signs,and neither the sagaic or the eddaic literature offers much in the way of what thesesigns might be except for a small handful of instances revolving around stumblingat the threshold before going out which is considered to be unlucky. However, JacobGrimm in hisTeutonic Mythologyhas recorded thousands of these that were still inuse during the early to middle 1800’s. Anyone wishing to access knowledge throughthe method of reading omens will find this four volume set of books indispensableboth for descriptions of the signs themselves and their interpretation.It is prudent to keep in mind, however, that the “signs” recorded by Grimmmay be borne out the Germanic mind but it is a “mind” that had evolved afterthe conversion to Christianity. On the other hand, many of the “signs” have exactparallels in neighboring cultures which did not convert until the mid-1400’s withlingering pockets of heathens remaining until the middle of the last century. Again,comparative religion can be of some benefit here especially when the cultures them-selves share many beliefs and practices.From the point of view of the ancient Germanic worldview, because an omen has“caught one’s attention,” one has already participated in an event which is relatedto other events, and as pointed out in Chapter 1, no events occur in isolation. Allevents occurring at any given moment are related to all other events occurring at7Jacobi, Jolande, ”Symbols in an Individual Analysis” inMan and His Symbols, Carl Jung,ed. (Dell Publ.

To see a particular bird, a cuckoo, for example, engaged in anactivity which it normally would not engage in, such as singing during the wrongtime of day or flying in an abnormal fashion, implies that there are other out ofthe ordinary conditions taking place in the world to which the cuckoo’s behavior isrelated; the cuckoo’s behavior is a signal, then, rather than a supernatural event.The cuckoo’s behavior is like the warning light in a car; one needs to understand “themeaning” of the light to know what is happening in some hidden place in the engine.Understanding relationships and connections helps when one is reading some of theodd interpretations in Grimm’s.When using any system to access knowledge from the Well of Urð, it is importantto have a consistent worldview. Every worldview, and there are many, is like thelogic behind a secret code. By understanding how a code is constructed, one is ableto interpret messages with little difficulty; however, if one does not understand thelogic behind the code, a message is nothing more than a series of curious symbolson a page. Without an understanding of the fine relationships between events anda method for seeing the role that a lucky-sign plays within the complex layer ofevents, an omen is just a curious, isolated occurrence and any attempt at interpretingthe sign is futile. It is the relationship between the individual, the sign, and the“unknown” of the same layer of events which lends meaning to the sign; this isthe background against which the omen plays that was mentioned earlier. Whenapproaching the reading of Germanic lucky-signs, it is crucial to have a good graspof the Germanic worldview.In the mid-1970’s, a man named Ralph Blum in the now fairly well-knownBookof Runes8created a system for using the ancient Germanic script, known today asrunes, as a form of divination. The idea was that each letter in the GermanicFUÞARK (Germanic alphabet; the namefuþarkis actually the first six letters ofthe alphabet: F U Þ A R K) carried with it a specific meaning. The book andits methods were really a first attempt at “reconstruction” of a Germanic system ofdivination recorded by Tacitus inGermania:“For omens and the casting of lots they have the highest regard. Theirprocedure in casting lots is always the same. They cut off the branch of anut-bearing tree and slice it into strips; these they mark with different signs8Actually, the use of runes for divination is older than Blum’s system by at least one hundredyears, at least as far as can be accurately traced without getting into much speculation. Avidrunesters, as they are often called like to trace the roots of their system back to Tacitus, but theproof of this is rather speculative. Additionally, these same folk disregard Blum’s system as beingboth artificial and non-Germanic and not without reason. Much has been written on the areaof runes which is far more traditional and accurate. The reader is referred to Edred Thorsson’s,Kveldulf Gundarsson’s, or Jan Fries’ books for more acceptable runic divination systems."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Chapter 7.

Then the priestof the state, if the consultation is a public one, or the father of the family ifit is private, offers a prayer to the Gods, and looking up at the sky picks upthree strips, one at a time, and reads their meaning from the signs scored onthem. If the lots forbid an enterprise, there is no deliberation that day onthe matter in question; if they allow it, confirmation by taking of auspicesis required. Although the familiar method of seeking information from theflight of birds is known to the Germans, they also have a special method oftheir own–to try to obtain omens and warnings from horses.”9Although there had been systems created in Germany by secret esoteric groups dur-ing the first part of this century, Blum’s system was the first to become widespreadoutside of occult circles and became a very popular item in New Age catalogs.Blum’s system was not based on the Germanic worldview, however, and another,a young student at the University of Texas, writing under the pen-name of EdredThorsson, sought to correct this and, eventually, wrote a trilogy of books (see thereading lists at the end of this book) setting the runic system of divination withinthe Germanic worldview. He based much of his material on Bauschatz’ materialpresented inThe Well and the Tree.10Although Thorsson presented fairly solidevidence for a historical precedence of this reconstructed system, it is not knownexactly what was written on the “slips” of wood described in Tacitus. Tacitus wasdescribing either very early Germanic people or possible even early Celtic, and sincethis second hand description came from so early on, it could be argued that “slips”were actually an early form of dice or lots, or that they were marked with non-runicsymbols. Thorsson and those following in his footsteps used both sagaic and eddaicmaterial to lend credence to their theories:“I know that I hung on the windy treefor nine long nightspierced by a spear –Óðínn’s pledge–9Tacitus, S. A. Handford, tr.,Tacitus: the Agricola and the Germania(Penguin Books;London, UK) 1970, p. 109.10See Chap. 2 for a fairly comprehensive overview of Bauschatz’ work."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð180given myself to myself.No one can tell about that tree,from what deep roots it rises.They brought me no bread, no horn to drink fromI gazed toward the ground.Crying aloud, I caught up the runes;finally I fell.”11and“He who would read the sacred runesgiven by the Gods,that Óðínn set downand the sage stained with color,is well advised to waste no words.”12Right or wrong, no one will ever know. The runic divination system is well con-structed, fits well within the Germanic worldview as it is understood today, and,overall, is very workable as a form of divination for thousands of people. It is a waythat folk of Northern European heritage can participate in their own ancestry.The third method for indirectly accessing knowledge, however, is probably themost dubious: the use of hex-signs, charms, or incantations. Oddly enough, many20th century rationalists think nothing of saying prayers before going to bed, orif they are atheists, to say affirmations in the mirror in the morning, to go to ahypnotist to quit smoking, or to attend a weekend seminar on Neurolinguistic Pro-gramming all of which are little more than updated versions of the same thing. Thepoint in this simple form of so-called “magic,” or “magick” as the modern occultistslike to spell it to differentiate it from the sleight-of-hand form of juggling, is tobring the individual’s subconscious mind in line with what is desired or is necessary.Modern researchers in the area of so-called psychic phenomena such as James Randi,a stage magician and modern debunker a la Harry Houdini, have attempted to showimplicitly that no application of “magic,” as far as anyone has been able to prove,has any effect on the laws of probability whatsoever. On the other hand, people who11Terry, PatriciaPoems of the Elder Edda”Sayings of the High One,” Sts. 138-39 (Univ. OfPennsylvania Press) 1989.12ibid.”Sayings of the High One,” St. 83."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð181practice this art-form swear by its effects, as do the religious folk with their prayers,hypnotists and their clients by mesmerism, positive thinkers by their affirmationsand Neurolinguistic Programmers by NLP. Whatever the reality of magic is, manypeople are obviously comforted by it, and a comfortable life is what most really seek.The tradition of creating hex-signs is ancient and has continued into this centuryrelatively unbroken in conservative areas like Pennsylvania and some of the other,surrounding states in the northeastern United States where there is a large popu-lation of people with Germanic ancestry. GoodHexemeeschder,as the makers ofhex-signs are called in Pennsylvania Dutch are called, are few and far between inthis day and age although Reconstructionists can be found fairly easily.Lee Gandee was a practicingHexemeeschderin rural West Virginia and authoredthe book calledStrange Experience13. In this autobiography, sadly no longer inprint, he explains in a typical Germanic fashion that the purpose behind the creationof a hex-sign was the same as that behind saying a prayer, so that the Powersoutside the scope of man could hear and intervene on the individual’s behalf. In achapter entitled “The Strangest Prayers are Painted,” he explains the constructionof the Germanic hex-sign which includes the painted portion of the hex, the “paintedprayer,” but also spoken and written prayers.Progressing backwards in time, in 1819, John George Hohman wroteDer Ver-borgene FreundorPow-wows or the Long, Lost Friend,which is a manual still inprint and still in use in the eastern portion of the United States. Although this smallbook contains no Pennsylvania type hex-signs as described14by Gandee inStrangeExperience,the construction of the charms have the same three-fold format: drawn(not painted), spoken and written. Of course, the charms were originally writtenin German with a Christian slant, but many of the techniques utilized such as thetimes for the administration of medicines or the “use of limbs growing from theeastward side of the tree, cut before the sun’s rise” have direct parallels in theAnglo-Saxon leechbook known as theLacnungawritten around 1000 CE.15Thereare many aspects of the Germanic Heathen tradition which have suffered gaps intime, but the creation and use of Germanic charms has come through an unbrokenline starting far back in the Heathen Age although most of the charms as they havebeen documented are colored by a very thin veneer of Christianity.In 1989, Stephen Flowers (a.k.a. Edred Thorsson) translatedThe Galdrabók,an Icelandic manuscript written between 1550 and 1650 CE, from Icelandic into13This book is sadly out of print but was originally published by Reward Books, EnglewoodCliffs, NJ, in 1971.14Hohman, John Geo.Der Verborgene FreundorPow-wows or the Long, Lost Friend(FultonReligious Supply Co.; Brooklyn, NY) not dated.15See Chap. 3, the discussion of theAcre-bot,regarding the history of the manuscript calledthe ”Lacnunga.”"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð182English. The book contains a text of 47 charms in the three forms (drawn, spokenand written) mentioned above; this time, however, the Christian coloring is eitherextremely thin or non-existent. Many of the spoken charms mention the HeathenGods by name, the written prayers are in late runic script (still in use during theperiod that this book was originally committed to parchment), and many of thesigns are of strange, angular shapes, probably, according to Flowers, stylized runicbind-runes, which are much like the overlapping letters of a modern monogram butwith magical significance as opposed to simply being the initials of someone’s name.Although the original text was Icelandic instead of German, one can still see theGermanic technique of the three forms.As mentioned above, there are texts from around 1000 CE, either a compilationof charms, such as theLacnunga,or discussing the use of charms within the contextof a narrative, such as in Egil’s Saga:“Then the queen and Bard marked the horn and passed it to the beer-server.She took it to Egil and asked him to drink it. Then Egil drew out his knifeand stabbed it into the palm of his hand. He took up the horn, carved runeson it, and rubbed in the blood. He said:‘I hatch the runes on the horn,help seal each spell with blood.Now, hear the nostrum I’venotched on this wild-ox horn.Let’s booze as we think bestbeer those cheerful girls poured.Bard’s marked it. What’s that mean?Mischief? Well, let’s find out.’The horn sprang apart and the drink poured down into the straw.”16This tradition shows the carving of runic symbols and the spoken charm as well.Dr G. Storms wrote an analysis of Germanic magic, particularly the Anglo-Saxonvariety, calledAnglo-Saxon Magicin 1948.17Most recently, Kveldulf Gundarsson,Warder of the Lore for one of the more popular reconstructionsist organizations (The16Fell, Christine, tr.Egil’s Saga(Everyman’ Library; London, UK) 1975, p. 62.17Out of Print but published by the Hague and occasionally available through inter-libraryloan."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Chapter 7.

His book is well steeped in the ancient Germanic world view. Sincethat time many others have written books, some combining the Germanic traditionwith the New Age or classical occultism of the Hermetic tradition while others, thereconstructionists, have written very good, well researched books. A reading list ofsome of these latter can be found at the end of this book.People are all different in their individual needs, but certain needs are consistentfor all. All want to be comfortable with life, in general, and want to make thejourney from birth to death meaningful and fulfilling. Virtually all cultures haveattempted to accomplish this by creating worldviews which help them extract themost out of life by offering a systems of interpretation which bring seemingly chaotic,random events in accordance with the needs of the community and the individual.Each culture, and each worldview, must take into consideration that a community ismade up of a variety of individuals with different spiritual, emotional, and physicalneeds as well. To this end, any worldview offers a variety of approaches to life rangingfrom the strictly physical needs of the atheist/ agnostic to the more spiritual needsof others while at the same time offering heritage and a place in history. So it iswith the Germanic worldview as well.The most base, physical approach in the system outlined in this chapter is thatof simply acting in a functional manner so as to ”go with the flow” to use a modernphrase. Other approaches are more ritualized in nature such as the celebrationsof the ancient holidays with an understanding of the purpose behind them as in-terpreted through the Germanic worldview. Other routes are more spiritual withmethods for extracting deeper meaning out of the happenings of the world. What-ever the individual’s needs are they can be met out of the same single system.TO DRINK AT THE WELL OF MÍMIRIn one way or another, all the methods outlined so far allow an individual toaccess the ̧orlögas it has been laid down in the Well of Urð.

It is thepath of the Whole-maker or the Cunning Man mentioned in Chapter 2.The story of the drink from Mímir’s Well is short.Óðínn, the chief of the Æsir, approached Mímir, the wisest of giants andthe Keeper of the Well, to ask if He too could drink from the Well of Knowl-edge. Mímir was agreeable but told the Allfather that it was necessary toleave a sacrifice. For a single draught of the Water, Óðínn left His eye in theWell, but from the draught, He received immense knowledge and an almostunquenchable thirst for more.Because of the events in the tale and in spite of its shortness, Óðínn had alwaysbeen known to the ancient Germanic peoples as the “One-Eyed God.” The tale wasof common enough knowledge that most graphic or plastic representations depictHim with only one eye, but why there is only small mention of it in the eddaic orsagaic literature is not known. Perhaps, originally, there was a more complete talethat has since been lost or, maybe, the tale of the draught was part of a larger tale.No one knows for certain.There is another tale involving Óðínn and one called Mímir. Although somehave debated whether this is the same Mímir,20Snorri Sturluson demonstrates nodoubt in theYnglingasaga.After the war between the Æsir and the Vanir was over,hostages were exchanged. One of the hostages sent by the Æsir was one called Mímir(Mimr), and the Vanir were not completely satisfied with the trade-off. So, as a signof contempt“they seized Mímir and beheaded Him and sent the head to the Æsir.Odhin [sic] took it and embalmed it with herbs so that it would not rot, andspoke charms over it, giving it magic power so that it would answer Him andtell Him many occult things.”21Simek summarized the debate as to whether there were originally two beings or one.“In the sagas of the Icelanders speaking heads are known but written of indifferent contexts. They are particularly well known from shamanic practices,20A discussion of this debate and its proponents can be found in Simek’sDictionary ofNorthern Mythology(D. S. Brewer; Cambridge, UK) 1993, pp. 216-217.21Sturluson, SnorriHeimskringla,Lee Hollander, tr. (University of Texas Press; Austin, TX)1964, p. 8."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð185but they are also known in Celtic areas where the link can be found betweenan oracle-speaking head and a spring. Therefore, it is not necessary to tryto separate the tales of the speaking head of Mimr and the wise Mímir intotwo distinct myths”22At least by Snorri’s time, the beings were considered to be the same.In recent years, this particular myth has received much attention, as has thetale of Óðínn’s hanging from the Tree to receive the runes. Ralph Metzner’s bookcited in several places in this book,The Well of Remembrance(the name Mímir isetymologically related to the word “memory”), is even named after the Well. Much ofthis speculation comes from a growing interest in the area of shamanism both ancientand modern (called “neo-shamanism”). Some of these researchers interpret the taleso that Óðínn has not really lost his eye but keeps it closed so that He can lookconstantly inside himself, the eye of self-reflection; others think that the eye allowshim a different perspective of the world, one that is separate from Himself. Neitherpsychological nor literary interpretations will serve the purpose here, however. Onlythe idea that the Well exists and can be drunk from is important.Before moving on to the discussion of the Well, the matter of the Whole-makerneeds to be made clear. There are obvious shamanic elements in much of the eddaicpoetry, and with these observations, there are arguments both for and against theidea that shamanism in any form played a role in the development and maintenanceof the Germanic religious, agricultural, and medical practices. The term sometimesequated with northern shamanism isseiðr, and many others interpret this to meansimply a form of divination. Gundarsson, in a lengthy review of both eddaic andsagaic sources, concludes his position by stating“It is, thus, fairly clear that the Norse (and probably, as far as we can tell)the other Germanic peoplesdid not have their own shamanism[my empha-sis]. However, it is also clear that they sporadically incorporated shamanicelements into their magical practice and a few of these elements may evenhave survived from earliest times.”23He further goes on to say that any speculation that shamanism’s being a part ofearly Teutonic culture is a distortion or a misrepresentation of the belief system ofthe Germanic forbears. It should be mentioned that Mr. Gundarsson speaks asone of the reconstructionists, being the Warder of the Lore for one of the largest’Ása-faith reconstructionist groups and, as such, has a vested concern in the properreconstitution of the beliefs of his ancestors.22Dictionary of Northern Mythology,R.

At the Well of Urð186Gundarsson’s definitions of shamanism, in the body of the article are based pri-marily on Mircea Eliade’s classical definition fromShamanism; Archaic Techniquesof Ecstasy24based on descriptions of practice from the Tungusic and various otherSiberian tribes. Although he clearly states that shamanism was not a core of Ger-manic culture as far as can be ascertained from written or archeological sources, hesoftens his stance, seemingly, for those readers involved in neo-shamanic practices,that“some form of shamanism was probably practiced by the earliest inhabi-tants of Northern Europe, who were hunters and gatherers and, for a time,reindeer herders. It should be noted that, whether or not the Germanicpeople practiced genuine shamanism in the historical period, these craftsare ultimately part of the Northern Heritage and . . . the reconstruction ofshamanism within the [Ring of] Troth is wholly fitting.”25His position, though, that well-wishing New Agers are fully capable of contaminatingancient Germanic spiritual philosophy is indeed correct since in the past decade therehave been numerous books written on the topic of “Shamanism in such-and-suchCulture” which are filled to the brim with gross errors of negligence, and faulty,unreliable, and unrealistic information, misinformation, deceptions, and outrightlies. For anyone following the path of the Reconstructionist, such writings areabhorrent and an abomination of the greatest magnitude. Some of the books whichcontain questionable, inaccurate, unreliable information can be found in the readinglists at the end of this book.On the other hand, there is a very large percentage of authors who have suspectedthat a form of Norse or Germanic shamanism did indeed exist. Even the foremostMircea Eliade devoted a portion of a chapter in hisShamanismto the probability ofits existence, but again his arguments are based on his own definition of shamanism.Eliade’s arguments area prioriusing Siberian shamanism as the arbitrary standardagainst which all other evidence is weighed. For the purpose here, however, the onlyapproach which can possibly be of any value while at the same time by-passing allarguments is ana posterioriinvestigation which forms definitionsafterthe fact asopposed to collecting data to support a theory. In other words, define apples andoranges separately rather than attempt to compare them.What is being sought for this discussion is characters belonging to a group ofenigmatic figures inanyof the Germanic literature of the time who1. seem to engage knowledge with a method different than those described above,24Eliade, MirceaShamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy(Princeton/ Bollingen Paper-backs, Princeton Univ.

Also excluded are those occupations which pertain to the normaleveryday organization of a community including warriors or traders; all these folkhave titles and roles from within communities of their own. Even the berserks hadan acceptable role and function within the community of warriors.The ON roles which seem to have fell outside the community were those peoplewho practiced asspá-kona/ -maðr, seið-kona/ -mann,or had knowledge offjölkyngi,görningar, gandreið,orhamfarir.Knowledge and practice of these things were oftenconsidered by people of the late Viking Age to be an abomination (with the exceptionof thespá-kona) or a “perversion” as both Snorri and the poet of the poem calledLokassennafrom theElder Eddacalled it.There are figures who fit these criteria quite well, Óðínn being the foremost.Óðíinn is described in theYnglingasagaas having a voracious appetite for knowl-edge:“Othin [sic] had the skill which gives great power and which He practicedhimself. It is called seith [sic] [sorcery], and by means of it He could knowthe fate of men and predict events that had not come to pass; by it He couldalso inflict death or misfortunes or sickness, or deprive people of their witsor strength, and give them to others. But this sorcery is attended by suchwickedness26that manly men consider it shameful to practice it, and so itwas taught to priestesses.“Othin knew about all hidden treasures, and He knew such magic spellsas would open the earth and mountains and rocks and burial mounds; andwith mere words He bound those who dwelled in them, and went in and tookwhat He wanted. Exercising these arts He became very famous. His enemiesfeared Him, and His friends had faith in Him and in His power. Most of these26The actual term from the original isergiwhich is discussed in some detail below."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð188skills He taught to the sacrificial priest. They were next to Him in all mannerof knowledge and sorcery.”27He is also said to have intentionally engaged in shape-shifting (non-consensus reality)while His body lay “as if asleep or dead,”28travel in animal-shape while entranced,and29had direct access not only to Mímir’s Well (as opposed to indirect access),as in the mythic tale above, but spoke with Mímir’s head physically (necromancy)which Snorri felt was different enough to report in a list of Óðínn’s other “odd”qualities. He fits all the criteria as reported above.Many of the above skills are reported in literature and folklore sources as beingavailable to the “average man” through the use of charms and access to power/luck, i.e., by practicing some of the methods as outlined above, but shape-shifting,working while entranced, and speaking physically with the dead (Mímir’s head),all, by their nature, took place outside of consensus reality. In the sagaic literatureand in folklore both ancient and modern, there is a general agreement that theseactivities are not part of everyday, normal life although the working of charms,prayer, and medicine is part of everyday life.There are many figures in the early Germanic literature who fall outside the realmof the norm for a given community but whose skills are utilized by the communityby temporarily bringing these folk within the boundaries. The women known as theseiðkonar(seeresses) are reported not to have engaged in the normal activities ofdivination, such as the reading of lots or the taking of omens, for their informationand are described as somehow being separate entities wandering from settlementto settlement being called in from the outside, indeed most of these did not evenlive within a community per se with the exception of the seeress described in theGroenlendigasaga.Egil Skallagrimsson, a master of runes and charms related topoetry, is described as a normal man who was able to perform extraordinary feats,but Eyvind Kelda in theSaga of Ólaf Tryggvasonis described as a “sorcerer andexceedingly skilled in wizardry,”30the same words used to describe Óðínn earlier intheYnglingasaga. The ”Angel of Death” as described by Ibn Fadlan in his auto-biographical tale of his travels among the Rus31also seemed to use techniques ormethods other than the normal acceptable ritual, charms, or divination.In theYnglingasaga, Snorri records that the Germanic people of at least hisperiod of time considered the practice of seið and other related sorceries to be27Sturluson, SnorriHeimskringla, Lee, Hollander, tr.

There are several reasons for such a translation but the primary one seemsto have come from comparative studies. In many circumpolar-shamanic cultures asdescribed in Eliade’s work, there is an enigmatic figure, neither man nor woman,called the “berdache” in French, who is a person of great power and is often thecommunity’s shaman. This coupled with the idea thatseiðrwas deemed properonly for priestesses seems to have resulted in the translation.This translation ofergiseems fitting when one considers the line from theLokasennawhere Loki accused Óðínn of “womanish ways” (Hollander translation),but others have chosen to simply translate the original phraseargs athalas trav-eling the world “in a wizard’s guise” (Terry and Page translations). There were nowritten laws against homosexuality or against transvestitism prior to the conversionto Christianity (remember the intolerant Christians?), and none of the wizards inthe sagas are described as being particularly effeminate or homosexual. One wouldthink that if sexual inversion were the basis of loathing towards “wizards” that therewould at least be some description of or allusion to such behavior in at least one ofthe many descriptions of the seiðmen, and there are none except where translatorshave chosen to translate the termargras such. The Germanic writers of the VikingAge seem not to have been overly concerned about the sexual behavior of a man.Their laws and rules of conduct, however, are more concerned with societal roles,social standing, and loyalty to family, community and king. The perversion ofseið,then, was most likely related primarily to acting the role of and dressing as a wizard.Apparently, there was something about this method of accessing knowledge whichwas considered perverse, but there is not enough evidence in ancient Germanicliterature to point the finger at transvestitism or homosexual relationships betweenmen.The people known as the Saamí were notorious even during the Viking Age fortheir skills in magic and wizardry. Although their religion had much in commonwith that of the northern Germanic people, it also differed much. One of the maindifferences was their community’s use of thenoaide,or shaman, who played a centralrole in their religion. Secondly, their religious rituals seem to have incorporated theuse of ecstasy to some degree where the Germanic religion did not although it couldbe argued that the use of mead or alcoholic beverages during the symbel, or thedrinking bout which apparently accompanied many of the Germanic rituals mayhave approached this in some way. Thirdly, even though thenoaidewas the centralfigure in the Saamí community, most of the “common people” in the tribe werecapable of shamanic ecstasy and were encouraged to work their own less powerfulform of magic in their daily lives. To this end, the “Finns,” as they were called by"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð190the Scandinavians and visitors writing about the Germanics of the far north, wereall considered skilled in magic.From what is known about the religion and spiritual philosophy of the Saamí,they most likely resembled the Germanic peoples in a great many ways. The dif-ferences between the two groups seems almost not to have been two completelydifferent religions really but variations of one another, at least in the north of Scan-dinavia. A comparable phenomenon exists today in many areas of the world whereCatholicism is the predominate religion so that in Haiti and in the southeasternUnited States there exists Catholicism side by side with voudoun or Santería, andin the southwestern United States the is the Church and the “Siete Podres” or “LosHermanos de la Luz y Sangré.” In Mexico, Central America, and South America,there is a use of the Saints by the common people which seems to be an unusualmixture of Catholic prayers and devotion mixed with spiritual techniques of theaboriginal culture. Such variations are not restricted to any particular ethnicityalthough even though a religion may have had its origin with one particular group.These are one-way variations, however; one has to be Catholic to belong to San-tería, but one does not have to belong to Santería to be a Catholic. Even though theSaamí religion greatly resembled the Germanic in terms of pantheon, spirit-world,and tales, their practical technique and approach was quite different except in ar-eas of overlap (border zones) which also resulted either in or from intermarriage,dual-religionism, and cultural blending.32The further north or east the culture in the ancient Germanic realm, the greaterthe number of reports of wizardry as opposed to simple charm-makers or diviners.Adam of Bremen reporting on the northern Norwegians said that“all who pass their lives in Norway are Christian through and through,except for those who live far off across the arctic regions by the ocean. Itis said that these people even now are so skilled in magic arts or spells thatthey claim to know what everyone over the world is up to. By their powerfulchants they even draw ashore the mighty monsters of the sea, and by practiceeasily do all sorts of other things that can be read of in the scriptures aboutwizards.”33Even though, upon light reading, it appears that he is writing of the Saamí, he ismost definitely speaking of Norwegians, the Northern Germanic people because later32Since the time of this writing Thomas DuBois has writtenNordic Religions in the VikingAge(U. Of Penn. Press, 1999). Mr. DuBois puts forth good evidence that there was a good dealof cultural borrowing between the Scandinavians of the Viking Age and the Finno-Ugric peoples,in particular, the Saamí. If the reader has an interest in this particular area, his book is well worththe dollars spent.33Page, R.

At the Well of Urð191in another paragraph, he discusses the Saamí or “Lapps” proper. In this particularpassage, most likely, he is speaking of an already blended culture, a border zone,and a variation of spiritual philosophy which has already crossed the boundaries ofethnicity.Thenoaideplayed a central role in the Saamí religion but this seems not to havebeen the case for the Germanic peoples at least in the sagaic or eddaic writings,but the figure of the wizard and the witch did present itself in these writings ratherextensively so that this method for accessing knowledge must have been well-knownto the Germanic peoples. James Chisolm, in a review of the Eddas and sagas forreferences toseiðr, fjölkyngi, andgörningar(all forms of sorcery as opposed tocharm-making), revealed a body-count of at least 150 different persons in Norway,Sweden and Denmark who were all considered to have had access to the knowledgeof Mímir’s Well through wizardry or witchcraft. Less than a half dozen of theseare listed as diviners, and even fewer are listed as functioning in any official orcentral capacity within the Germanic religion of the time. Without the central rolein religion or society, they all fall outside Mircea Eliade’s definition of shaman.In early Germanic society, it was customary that people who lived and functionedoutside the auspices of a family, community, or kingdom and sets of social ruleswere greatly frowned upon. Berserkers, men who were capable of becoming totallyovercome with rage in the fury of battle, were regarded with suspicion and tendedto live on the outskirts of a town (probably for safety’s sake since they were knownto kill both friend and foe in the chaos of battle) but were generally accepted, albeitcautiously, within the communities of warriors. Outlaws, however, people who hadbeen disowned by their own community, were despised and loathed to such a degreethat many of the adjectives describing them contain the wordvargr(ON “wolf”)which was the most hated animal of northern Europe and was usually killed onsight; an outlaw was considered the lowest of human or animal forms and, accordingto the system ofwergild,could be killed on sight with no legal need to compensatethe family.The description of wizards in the eddaic and sagaic literature usually showed aman or a woman who did not seem to have any firm ties to a family, community, orking, and when they were described as belonging to a community, i.e. living in thegeographical area of a community, no binding ties to family or society are given. Itis quite possible, then, that the claims ofperversionon the part of the wizard hadto do with this odd break from community, being neither part of a community norquite an outlaw, a ”fence-rider” with one foot within and the other without. Thereare a great many descriptions of wizards being killed for one reason or another butnever any description of how compensation to the families were handled.Curiously, Óðínn was often accompanied by “pet wolves,” and considering the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð192relationship between the word for “wolf” and the Scandinavian words and phraseswhich meant “outlaw,” one must wonder if the fact that these wizards were notassociated with any family or community gave rise to the idea that these peoplewere somehow viewed as being outlaws. Descriptions of them in the early literaturecertainly lead one to believe that they must have been either transient, as in thecase of the travelingspákonar(“seeresses”), or living as hermits or eccentrics outsidethe protection of communities and, as such, would have been accorded the sameadjectives as any other criminal.In any society or culture, visionar-Figure 7.2. Northern Seeress–photo frompub. dom.ies, eccentrics (literally, “outsiders”), shamansor any other such person who has ac-cess to “a different knowledge” have apenchant for disregarding societal rolesand for going against the grain of socialmores. Some cultures, such as the Samí,awarded these “odd characters” a spe-cial place in society which offered someimmunity against the law. In a similarmanner “Hole in the Sky,” an Ojibwamedicine man, described himself as “anevil man” and “greatly feared,”34but hissociety did not kill such people; becauseof the role he played within his commu-nity, he was enjoyed the right to live.Other societies seem not to have pro-tected these people but allowed theirwizards/ shamans to live most likely be-cause of the services they provided (sim-ilar to way prostitutes and drug-dealersare allowed to live in modern America):divination (spá), changing luck (fjölkyngi), psychopomp (“Angel of Death”), chang-ing weather (görningar, fjölkyngi, gandreið), calling animals, fishes, etc. (gandreið),healing, soul-craft (probably all forms).35The type of knowledge that these people dealt with often went far beyond thatof the charm-makers and runemasters. Rather than simply “reading the Waters ofUrð” to gain knowledge of ̧orlögso that actions could be adjusted accordingly, thesemen and women had “drunk directly from the Well of Mímir” and had acquiredthe knowledge and skills to manipulate events directly. They were no longer themarionettes on the stage like average people, as described in Chapter 2, but are the34Landes, RuthOjibwa Religion and the Midewiwin(The University of Wisconsin Press;Milwaukee, WI) 1968, p. 57-67.35This list is highly speculative based on how some of the border-cultures deal with thesesocietal problems. A person who was capable of creating charms could, of course, create charmsto handle all these situations; a rune-master, likewise, would have used runic forms of magic; aperson trained by the Samí, trance-journeying or ”diving” as they themselves call it."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð193stage hands “behind the scenes” manipulating and rearranging the unseen. To beable to do so, however, they had to leave thestageof culture and societyplacingthemselves in the same position as the outlaw or the “vargr.” They worked by adifferent set of rules than their communities of origin (which may have, incidently,included the phenomenon of the “berdache”). They worked unseen by normal eyes,in the world of dreams and visions, and, because of this they were not to be trusted.Óðínn, although chief of the Æsir, kept company with wolves–the most despisedof animals, was an oath-breaker, was unfaithful to those who trusted in Him (includ-ing his wife), was a thief, a necromancer, traveled in disguise (a perverse behavior ina society where lineage and knowledge of lineage was important), was a liar, was ableto murder by magic, and, generally, was not overly trusted by even those who puttheir faith in Him as a patron God. His behavior was often sociopathic and erraticnot unlike descriptions of circumpolar shamans or Germanic or Celtic visionariesand saints. In spite of this, He was tolerated and revered, and even feared becauseof His knowledge and power to manipulate events. Such seemed to be the role ofthe northern wizard.“Drinking at Mímir’s Well,” if this position can be accepted, had to have been aloathsome choice of lifestyle for the Germanic peoples, requiring a sacrifice not manywere willing to give: the sanctuary of community for the freedom of the outlaw, thelove of relatives and friends for their fear and derision. The knowledge to which theyhad access, if Óðínn’s behaviors can be used as the prime example, often requiredthe sacrifice of lives or engaging in behaviors which were often counter to thosecommonly deemed acceptable so to attain or strive for goals which were far beyondthe scope of understanding for the average man. In Óðínn’s case, all odd behaviorssuch as those mentioned above, and, including the one which Loki accused Him ofin “The Insolence of Loki,”“Be quiet, Óðínn! You never coulddecide a fight fairly.I know how often you have allowedthe weaker man to win!”36were all towards a single end: the staving off of the Ragnarök. He acted in such a wayto prevent the early demise the Tree, and in so doing, there were necessary sacrificesalong the way including His own son and His own eye. It almost seems that He wascompelled or being driven by a force outside Himself towards the preservation of the36Terry, PatriciaThe Poems of the Elder Edda(University of Pennsylvania Press) 1990, p.76."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð194Whole. Indeed, saints and shamans both often describe their lives and the choicesthey have made as if they are being driven or forced by otherworldly forces.37Óðínn’s quest for knowledge was not quenched by his little sip from Mímir’sWell. He has a voracious appetite for knowledge which often resulted in his leavingÁsgard to travel in disguise through other lands. In shamanic cultures, the shamanis often seen to have a never ending pursuit of knowledge which leads him to leavethe village or community for periods of time only to return so that the knowledgegained can be put to use. In a way, this is very much akin to the literary motifs of“the Underworld Journey” or “the Hero’s Journey” in which an individual is drivenby either an internal of external force to leave the safety of his home only to returnwith hard-won wisdom and maturity which is then put to use within the community.The Germanic version of these motifs, however, placed the figure of the Whole-makeroutside the bounds of the community, working for the benefit of the preservationon the Whole from without rather than from within as in shamanic cultures. Here,then, is the primary difference between the ancient northern Germanic and trueshamanistic cultures.The role of the wizard or Whole-maker in Germanic society was a precariousone. On the one hand, he or she filled a certain need within a community to bringit into Wholeness; on the other hand, whoever had dealings with a Whole-makerwas taking a walk across thin ice. This feeling that one should deal with wizardsgingerly has continued to survive in folk-culture so that even the Baum’s Wizard ofOz or Tolkien’s Gandalf fall into this in-between state of being neither good nor bad.The average man’s purpose of task and goal in mind are often different than theWhole-maker’s, and just because one has obtained assistance from one of this kinddoes not mean that all things are going to go well or that costly sacrifices will notneed to be made. Here one is reminded that Óðíinn often allowed favorite warriorsto die in battle. The diviners, herbalists, and charm-makers served the communityof man, but the Whole-maker served the higher purpose: the health and integrityof the Tree.Back again to the problem, then, of definition and whether of not these peoplequalify as Norse shamans. Eliade early in his classic text on shamanism is quickto point out that “shamanism in the strict sense is pre-eminently a religious phe-nomenon of Siberia and Central Asia.”38He goes on to say that“the presence of a shamanic complex in one region or another does not37See Joan Halifax’Shamanic Voices, 1979 and Mircea Eliade’sShamanism: Archaic Tech-niques of Ecstasy,1964.38ibid., p. 4."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð195necessarily mean that the magico-religious life of the corresponding people iscrystalized around shamanism.”39Because a culture has the elements of a shamanic complex, does not necessarilytranslate into the idea that a culture ever engaged in shamanism in its truest sense.Here, there is agreement between what was found by Mr. Gundarsson and theaposterioriapproach taken here: the Germanic peoples do not seem to have everengaged in shamanism per se, at least according to the writings which have beenpreserved. However, there is definite record of a phenomenon which correlates wellwith the knowledge to which shamans had and have access, to the skills they havedemonstrated, and to a role, or at least part of a role, which shamans play within acommunity.Some of the pieces of the “classical shamanic complex” found in Germanic culturewere outlined above, but they are simply pieces and seem to have always beenpieces. Wizards or Whole-makers, in Germanic folk-memory, often travel in thecompany of others, and this is most notable in Tolkien’sLord of the RingswhereGandalf in but one member of a ”council of wizards” each demonstrating one or moreskills of the entire shamanic complex, but with none actually practicing as a singleindependent unit, practicing all the elements. This division of labor also occurs inthe sagaic, folkloric, and historical literature, where the “Angel of Death” functionsas a psychopomp; the seeress in theGroenlendiga Saga, Þórrbjorg, functions as adiviner; Kotkell, his wife, Gríma, and their two sons, were death-bringers; Þórrveig,in Kormak’s Saga, was a changer of ̧orlög; and Heið, the völva in Hrolf’s saga Kráki,was a hide-farer (“spirit-traveler”). There is no evidence that a single person didnot practice several elements of the so-called shamanic complex or practice his artalone, although there is much evidence to the contrary, but there is also a large bodyof evidence that these people practiced in larger groups (much like the MidewíwinSociety of the Ojibwa)40which may have given rise to the numerous legends of covensof witches meeting on certain mountain tops on the eves of Winternights, Júl, andSummernights. In all, there is no documented case where any individual actuallyfunctioned in the capacity commonly associated with the technical definition of“shaman.”What existed, then, was a subculture of men and women who demonstratedpowers beyond the average man, who had access to a wisdom which reached beyondthe lineage of any individual person or community, who engaged in forms of tranceor ecstasy to access their knowledge and to perform their acts, and who often bandedtogether with others so that a group of specialists could function as a single, wholeunit. These men and women were calledseiðmenandseiðkonar,respectively, and39ibid.,p.5.40See Landes’ book cited above."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. At the Well of Urð196these titles are commonly translated as wizards and witches. With the New Agetitles of “witch” and “wizard” already being utilized for other practices, perhaps theoriginal ON forms are best left alone or, as has been done in this book, are translatedinto something more meaningful to an English speaking audience such as “Cunningwo/man” (emphasizingfjölkyngi) or Whole-maker (emphasizing the ideas that onehas access to knowledge of the “whole” and puts that knowledge into use to preserve“wholeness”).A curious tradition which further leads one to the inevitable idea that theWhole-maker as has been described so far was common in the folk mind of theearly Germanic people can be found in a lengthy poem calledThe Heliand.41Thisepic poem is an Anglo-Saxon re-telling of the New Testament. The story line isobviously Christian, but the author of the poem to make this character of Je-sus seem believable in terms of strength, knowledge, courage, and power foundit best to present Christ as a powerful Germanic wizard with an entourage of twelve“warrior-thanes” to whom He also taught the secrets of “sooth-saying” (divinationwhile lightly entranced. i.e.,seiðr) and of healing. Apparently, in the author’s mind,a person who had direct access to knowledge, power/ luck, and who functioned onMiddle-Earth as the physical arm of a God, i.e. by action alone, had to have beena wizard or a Whole-maker hence Christ’s epithet ofHeliand,the “Best of Healers/Whole-makers.”42Oddly enough, this resetting of the tale of Christ is possibly oneof the most complete and detailed descriptions of the life and death of a Germanicwizard, in spite of the obvious Christian intrusions, from this period of time.In the epic, Jesus crosses cultural boundaries, and, although He had been borninto a community, He forsook the community life to follow a path which He felt hadbeen given Him. He negotiated between “clans,” healed by directly dealing with “evillittle creatures,”43and by manipulating or protecting “life-force,”44dealt with thespirits of nature directly,45and because of His dubious position outside of commu-nity, was eventually “killed” in a manner which the ancient author obviously parallelsto Óðínn’s hanging on the World Tree. To present Jesus to the Anglo-Saxons, thepoet needed to place Jesus in a role which was acceptable within Germanic culture.He had to be depicted as somebody who understood the Germanic spiritual philos-ophy, who understood the need for the staving off of the Ragnarök (Apocalypse),and whose knowledge of all contained within the World Tree extended far beyondthe concept of any single community’s ̧orlög: theHeliand, the Whole-maker.41Murphy, G.

At the Well of Urð197The existence of this subculture of wizards, witches, andseiðfolk cannot bedenied nor can their role or roles. The entire subculture functioned collectively asdid the shamans of the Siberian culture. What is often forgotten, particularly inthis so-called New Age, is that the shaman was not strictly a healer; he was creator/destroyer, healer/ killer, maker of medicine/ poison, black/ white, evil/ good. Inthe northern European culture, the polarities were often split apart creating theoriginal Ása-pair Óðínn vs. Loki or Jesus (theHeliand) vs. Satan and continu-ing on down through folklore until reaching the modern counterparts of Tolkien’sGandalf vs. Saruman or the witches of the East/ West versus Glenda and theWizard in Baum’sWizard of Oz.The picture drawn in early Germanic literature,though, is that the figure of the wizard orseiðmanis somewhere between goodand evil, both loved and feared. Even the Tree Itself is being both destroyed andrenewed at the same time. Whatever the situation may have been, no single figureexisted in the Germanic culture; the “Angel of Death” had her entourage, Þórrbjornneeded her singer, Kotkell worked with Gríma, Óðínn depended on Loki. Eachindividual was always a fragment of the “whole” no matter how well rounded he orshe was in skill. Shamans, within their culture, were often viewed as a collection of“whole-individuals”; on the other hand, a collective of all individual Whole-makersmade up a single, “whole-collection.”There has always been a percentage of people who are, for whatever reason,driven by forces outside themselves to participate in the Universe as conduits forthose forces. They carry within themselves access to power/ luck which goes farbeyond the straight forward access to lineage. These often do not fit well within acommunity and, consequently, are “loners” in search of a way of life which will permitthem to live functionally. They see far beyond personal needs of any individual oreven of any community. In the 20th century, these folk will often move from onespiritual philosophy to another, first yoga, then Buddhism, then New Age cults, thenperhaps over to Catholicism. Many become alcoholics or drug addicts along the waybecause of their need to deal with ecstasy and other altered states. They have tastedthe Waters of the Well of Mímir and, like Óðínn, are forever compelled to search forsomething to quench their insatiable thirst for knowledge. Without a clear worldview, many of these live on the fringe of madness, although many others eventuallymake their way into therapy, ecstatic religions such as the peyote-imbibing NativeAmerican Church or Santería, or into insane asylums because they have no otherway, in this current age of rationalism and science where the ordinary person is thestandard up to which all others are held.

Ini-tially, when I began to write this book in 1990, I wanted to write about seið andits effect on me, but every attempt resulted in a miserable failure. The approach,then, that I decided to take was to present to the reader first and overview of theworldview of an Asatru man before attempting to write about a topic as nebulousand seið. In reality, this only makes sense since this is how I was made. For almost20 years I was an Asatru man, but I had nothing to do with seið, i.e. the worldviewexisted long before the events that I’m going to describe now. If the reader has"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman202read all the preceding chapters up to this point, then, he has followed my life inchronological order.For the first 20 years of my life as an Asatru man, as stated above, I had noth-ing to do with seið and had basically grown to despise the eclecticism of the NewAge. I’ve written a number of papers over the years describing my discussed atthe “mix-and-match” approach of the Wiccans, pseudo- druids, and fake NativeAmericans (people of European ancestry parading about in Native American garband participating in pay-per-event “sweats” and Sundances). I had made light ofthe fact that many of these had changed their names from their family names to“Indians sounding” names such as Willow Of Light, Owl Wolf, Singing Tree, etc.To this day, I harbor little love for this particular group of people although myheart has softened enough to pity them, to some degree, because they were lostand apparently are still looking for their history. They are generally a sad group ofpeople grabbing and everything “mystical” that they can find.Before I begin, I must stress the difference between spa and seið. Spá, as statedin earlier chapter, is a form of divination which has been taken to an artform/performance level by Diana Paxson and her group, Hrafnar, out of Berkeley, CA.Although I have had some interaction with this particular group and I regard manyof the members of this group highly, I do not practice spa. Seið, on the other hand,is more poorly defined in the sagaic literature, but is generally considered a form ofmagic which involves movement of the conscious portion of the mind out the bodyto interact with the other world to effect changes on Midgard. The plan, then, forthis chapter is to describe how this came about in my life, and, hopefully, to moreclosely defined seið through narrative of my own personal history and practice.8.1. The Death:My personal history prior to my breaking point about twelve years ago was notatypical of young males in this day and age. By the time I was 35 years old, I hadbeen married twice, had two children (one from each marriage), had been divorcedtwice, had a professional degree and worked on the cutting edge of my field in avery competitive fashion. Although I grew up in the late 1950s and lived throughthe hippie era, I had become something that I fully despised: a cutthroat yuppie.My philosophy of life (although I fully embraced Asatru) was simple: trust no oneand take first so that you don’t get taken. I was playing a game of King of theHill and would do anything to scramble up to the top. I found that was easiest tobeat the ones lower than me down further because I felt their corpses made a firmfoundation. The ones up above me could be most easily handled through denigration"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman203and disinformation; if everything worked out right, they quickly became one of thecorpses below.By 1990, I had become one of the big names in my field. Whenever anybodytalked about who was actually doing cutting edge research my name always cameup with my group of cronies. For quite a longtime this made me feel good aboutwho I was until I realized that I was pretty much alone. Being King of the Hill isgreat but it is also very lonely and the corpses who form the foundation below don’tmake for very good company. Most people did not want to be around me for anygreat length of time. They were bored by my narcissistic tendencies. My family hadleft me, my children didn’t want be around me, and my friends quit calling.It was during the same period of time that I started to drink more than usual.“Usual” meant every evening. However, I was spending many weekends alone, drunkand often passed out. Looking back at the period of time I realize that I had burntevery bridge that I had. My breaking point came fast and hard.One morning, a week after being fired from a good job “because of my attitude”I woke up and realized that the game was over. All my luck had been squanderedaway. From an Asatru point of view I was on the brink of death. Without luck,a human body cannot survive. Intuitively, I knew this. I resigned myself to myapartment to wait for death. I would like to say that death never came but it did.I never, to this day, have recovered any of my luck. On that day I became one ofthe walking dead.Now, if I were in the reader’s shoes, I would certainly question this last para-graph. “How poetic! How romantic sounding! But obviously you’re not dead sinceyour writing this book!” Then I would roll my eyes upward and make one of thosesighing sounds that I often make one I’ve had my fill of a New Ager’s rant. Let mejust say that I’m not being poetic or romantic. That which I had built up over atime of 35 years completely fell apart before my eyes. I didn’t care whether I livedor died, whether I ever saw my children again. I walked the streets of my smalltown in a daze, hollow-eyed, and severely underweight. I didn’t care if I was cleanor dirty, if my teeth were brushed, or if my hair had been combed at some point inthe last week. My clothes were full of holes and were often dirty. Although I hadn’thad drop of alcohol to drink during that time I walked about as if I were in themiddle of a blackout and, in a sense, I was.My consciousness, my hugr, was not often inside my body at the time. In general,my body was simply animated and my hugr would check in every once in a while tosee if it was still alive. This is a common definition of death for Asatru or anyoneelse for that matter. The soul separates from the body, then the body is buriedor burnt. In my particular case, however, the body didn’t die (although some whoknew me at that particular time would say that whether my body had died or not"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman204was debatable). It was at the same time that I contracted pneumonia which beganon December 18, 1991, and ended on Sept. 3, 1992.Now I must talk about the changes in my body that occurred during that periodof time. These were not changes in this sense of the changes that hormones make atpuberty; these were a complete restructuring/rebuilding of my body as would takeplace under a surgeon’s knife after a severe car crash. My surgeons were not people;they were ghosts.The first ghost who came to me and spoke in my madness was what is calledin common language “pneumonia.” Pneumonia spoke to me from the first day(12/18/91). I was told that time that was being necessarily rebuilt and that hewould be living with me for the next ten months. I was also told that time thatI was completely devoid of luck in that my fate was in the hands of ghosts andthat there was nothing that I can do to interfere with their procedures. Of course,I didn’t believe a single word of it. The way I figured it, I was hallucinating (orsomething along those lines). I told the hallucination/phantasm that I would easilyoverride the silliness of the whole thing by scheduling a doctor’s appointment andgetting a prescription for some strong and antibiotics. To my surprise the ghostresponded with “Go-ahead, do whatever you think is proper, but we run the shownow. The timeframe of ten months stands no matter what you do and you caneither make it hard on yourself or roll with it.” This was rather shocking news tome but I went ahead and scheduled the doctor’s appointment anyway. The readermust understand that I am naturally a skeptic, and skeptics don’t generally put thefate of their lives in the hands of hallucinations or dreams.I went to the doctor who confirmed the pneumonia and promptly started around of antibiotics. These were well but only for period of about two weeks. I wassick that was losing weight quickly. I dropped down to 138 pounds. My face washollow as is common with those hospitalized with pneumonia. I continued with myskeptical approach throughout the entire course of the pneumonia and returned tothe doctor for antibiotics three more times. Oddly, I was never hospitalized for thedisease although I’m not sure why did this day. I’ve seen my medical chart that Idoctor’s office (I work in the medical field so have access to my own chart) and thediagnosis at that time was severe chronic pneumonia with pleurisy). Throughoutthis time the hallucinations or madness continued and I was never able to acceptthat “pneumonia and his cronies” were running the show until Sept. 3rd, 1992.Over the course of the next ten months I was visited by a number of ghosts whocontinue to accompany me to this day. The first ghost was that of the Fly Agaric,amanita muscaria, which scared me. This ghost came in several dreams/hallucinations.“He” told me who he was, where and when he could be found, and how he was tobe prepared. Eternal skeptic that I am I looked up Fly Agaric in not just one"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman205but several mushroom books, studied the chemical makeup of the mushroom, readnumerous reports of amatoxic poisonings, and concluded the hallucination to benot only wrong but dangerous. Fortunately, as far as I knew, the mushroom wasextremely rare around these parts so while I continued to have the dreams andbasically ignored what they had to say. The second ghost/hallucination which camewas that of a huge flower that seemed to grow and some high mountainous region ofSouth America. In my mind this was very fortunate because this particular ghostwas not very nice. In fact, he was very threatening, warrior like: all business anddangerous to deal with. This ghost was quite different from the Fly Agaric, whowas a rather friendly, funny, elflike creature. The ghost of the flower seemed to bemore like an evil demon something like a Catholic devil type creature never to betrusted. My life went on in an unpredictable fashion and I would encounter both ofthese ghosts again.The plant ghosts described above haunted me through the winter of 1991. Therewas a change my disease, however, by March of 1991 and the hallucinations becamemuch more intense. By this time I had tried and failed with the second round ofantibiotics. The ghosts began to arrive in small groups. These, different from theplant ghosts, began to take me places, nasty, dark places, in my dreaming. Alsodifferently, these ghosts began to dismantle my body by ripping, slashing, tearing,and cutting. Through the spring of 1991 I was torn apart several times, had holestorn in various parts of my body, had appendages removed through not-so-surgicalprocedures, and in general, I was battered, bruised, and beaten severely. My sleepworld had become a dungeon of horrors. Physically, I was required to sleep in asitting position only because lying down would result in spasmodic coughing whichcould not be stopped. The pleurisy had developed to a point where I had to wrapmy chest tightly with an ace bandage just to breathe. I hated to go to sleep becauseof the dreams but I had no choice because my body would not stay awake.Through the spring my life consisted of pain and nightmares. Physically, I wasnever comfortable. Mentally, I was ravaged. At one point, birds of prey came andripped open the top of my head just let the wind pass through from the top of myhead out through my anus. The pain was immense and unbearable. Another time,I was wandering through some underground caves, was snatched up by a giant of aman, had my head torn from my body, and my body was slowly cut with giant razorblades into hundreds of pieces like human stew meat. Each cut burned. The partsof my body were thrown into three large stewpots with boiling water that looked asif it had been dredged up from the bottom of a swamp. The water burned my skinsomewhere way beyond 3rd degree burns. My bones, when the flesh had fallen awayto the bottom of the sewage pot, were dredged up and beaten on an anvil with ahuge sledgehammer until they were little more than powdery sludge. Each ring of"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman206the hammer shot pain through my head as if I were being beaten with a baseballbat. Eventually, my skeleton was beat back together. The giant of a man informedme that he was placing one extra small bone in my neck. He beat skin together anddraped it over my frame. I could see myself from above and I looked like somethingfrom a horror film like Night of the Living Dead. The dreamtime lasted for threedays but I’m not sure how long the dream actually lasted and physical time. Nomatter, the pain was intense, I was horrified, and seemed to last forever.The hallucinations/ dreams lightened up somewhat after that experience, butthey continued on for the next several years. They should mention that the dreamsdid not only take place during sleep but during the day as well. I would see ghosts inthe forests high in the mountains, walking down the street, at work, and particularlyat graveyards and funerals. It was if a clear plastic sheet were always hanging downin front of me and on that sheet I could see the reflections of people standing behindme. I could see these people, they could see me (usually), I could speak with themand interact with them, but they were thin and translucent. This is really the bestway that I can explain it. It was as if the Otherworld were somehow overlapping onto Midgard.In September of 1992 I went to a fiddle contest in Santa Fe, NM. I was scheduledto play on a Sunday afternoon with a band that we had thrown together. Everythingwas prepared and we had practiced our numbers several times. I was sitting in thebleachers watching the bands who preceded us. About three bands before we werescheduled to play, I became extremely nauseous. My stomach started rolling, I wassweating profusely, I was becoming faint and I felt as though I were going to fallfrom the bleachers. I had a suspicion that I was going to fall into hallucination rightthere on the spot (remember, I still believed these to the hallucinations) and I toldmy music partner that I needed to be driven home. At first, he thought I was jokingbut after he looked at me he realized that I was sick and probably needed to bedriven to the hospital. He helped me down from the bleachers and over to the carand we left.About 30 miles down the road it lifted. Pneumonia, the ghost, detached itselffrom me and I felt fine. In fact, I felt better than I could ever remember in mythirty-six years on this planet. I felt light, healthy, well rested. Pneumonia’s partingwords were “It is done. We are finished.” It was at that point that for the first timeI realized this wasn’t a dream or hallucination but some kind of warp in the fabricof reality.Being a skeptic, a voice felt somewhat queasy about talking in terms of ghosts.On the other hand, my experience with pneumonia over the past ten months leftme feeling as if a good friend had just left for an extended vacation. And althoughI had come to accept pneumonia is not only having a life of his own separate from"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman207mine, I came to realize that he also had a personality and a personal agenda. Ina sense, pneumonia had moved in my mind from simply been a disease to being acomplete personage, a ghost, as it were. The others were still more aligned withbeing dream characters or hallucinations, but that was short-lived.About one week later, I was out collecting herbs in the deserts of NM somewheresouth of Santa Fe, and for the first time I saw it: the South American devil flowerlived here. I came upon the exact scene that I remembered from the dream of thewinter before. The flower was huge with the very sweet, almost sickeningly sweet,scent and leaves stank somewhat reminiscent of crushed leaves of a tomato plant.That I had learned the proper method for approaching and collecting the plant cameback to me as a memory. The plant’s name is Toloache and the Latin name is daturameteloides.As a medicine, the plant is very unpredictable and dangerous. It is not oftenused because of its unpredictability. In my 25 years in NM numerous people havedied in respiratory distress from toying around with the plant as a recreationaldrug. However, it is much more common for people to ingest the plant and thencommit acts of violence while on a 24-hour blackout. Some of these acts of violenceare committed against themselves (like the man who stabbed himself through theskull with an ice pick which had to be removed surgically from between the cerebralhemispheres) and some are committed against others (shooting one’s best friendunder the influence of Toloache is common). Here I was approaching and collectingthis dangerous plant using a ceremony which came to me in a hallucination.Somewhere in early winter of 1992/1993 I was sitting with my music partnerand,Richard, a friend of his. We were kind of chuckling about what an odd year Ihad experienced, and some point the dream about the ghost of the Fly Agaric cameup in the conversation. Richard grew interested at that point. He said in his ownquaint south Mississippi way “Hell, them ain’t rare. They grow all over my land upin the mountains!” I was stunned and could speak for a moment. “Are you sureit’s the same ones?” I asked. “Hell, yes. I get them by the hundreds, all over theplace. Never would take them though.” (He had a liking for recreational drugs andused them regularly.) I immediately felt strange as if the dream-ghost were reachingout from my sleepy memory guiding my movements so that I would be in just theright place at just the right time. His piece of land up in the mountains were tobecome my first collecting place for the Fly Agaric, and although I felt him to beexaggerating at the time, if anything, he was understating the numbers."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman2088.2. The Sick Come By:My life, my new life, was no longer under my control. Events would occur sothat I would be there just at the right time. I seem to be moved either in time orplace to avoid car crashes and other accidents or I would be put in the path of anevent which seemed to be occurring for my benefit. For a period of time it seemedthat the hallucinations had switched places with reality. On the one hand I feltthat I had very little control over my life, but on the other hand events were beingguided from the outside so that I could live and grow. This is how it was when thesick began to come by.The first few who had come by were like me: their luck had either been squan-dered like mine or had been damaged in some way or other. There was no realceremony or distinct method for dealing with these people. I would simply circle usaround with a rope which had been given to me by a river ghost. The rope wasn’treally there to protect us as the New Age folk would try to tell me; it simply tiedme together with the person that I was working with. (Actually, I don’t work insidea “circle” like Wiccans mainly because as soon as I get started, I travel – the moreabout that later.) After a time, a song will come up which brings the ghosts. Someof them run and get information on the client, and some of them confer with oneanother (and me) to determine a proper course of action. From that point on thesession develops itself.I am uncomfortable using a term like “ceremony” for what I do. The word“ceremony” for me brings up visions of people droning on and on, quoting out of thebooks, calling on ancient names, and dealing with gods – this is not what I do. I gointo a session, call on my friends to help, and from there we simply function as ateam to get a job done. I have nothing to do with gods ever in my sessions. Thereis only me and my SWAT team of ghosts.At one point during my hallucinatory phase, the pneumonia occupation, Odinapproached me and held a spear up to my heart. He offered to teach me and takeme under his wing. I found this to be a frightening and repulsive thought and so Irefused. He made a few minor threats and then belted out and evil sounding laugh.Before he backed up (to allow me to escape), he made one little scratch immediatelybelow my left breast. As soon as I was able, I turned tail and ran as fast as Icould. I’ve never had dealings with any gods except Thor and only then on veryrare occasions. I don’t work with gods.The healing sessions which I do with the sick are always the same in format. Ashort diagnosis by the team of ghosts is done to assess the situation and the plan ofaction is drawn up. Generally, although not always, either Fly Agaric or Toloachewill offer their services. It’s kind of like going to travel agent to help determinethe best route to a place and to determine the best means of travel. Fly Agaric"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman209is very lackadaisical and somewhat whimsical to travel with but Toloache is likesitting astride a rocketship. I’ve never worked with Toloache without some sense oftrepidation. Of the two Toloache “seems” the more powerful but looking back overall the years I’ve worked with these two, it seems to be six of 1 and a 1/2 dozenof the other. The choice between the two really has more to do with advantage asopposed to power.Once the plants have been prepared and taken the healing process is started.This generally involves much travel, collecting necessary items, and manipulation ofthe client internally. I don’t really manipulate the client physically (although I doon occasion), but by this I mean that I manipulate the Flow of Waters inside him.First, it is necessary to figure out what the normal flow is supposed to be, what isblocking the efficiency of flow, and then to make some changes internally so thatflow is normalized. Often there are “knots” inside the body which must be untied,cutaway, or bypassed.When I am inside the body of the client I am functioning within a small land-scape. It’s a smaller territory than the rest of the world but it is complete withtrees, rivers, rocks, beings (from large beasts to small ‘critters’), small villages, etc..The condition of the landscape shows me the client’s overall condition. Sometimesit is very lush and verdant at other times it can be a dry, hot desert. The conditionof Flow of the Waters tells me about their luck. The inflow end connects to their an-cestry and their immediate family, and the output end tells me about their personaluse of their own power/luck. Any point in the landscape can be damaged for anynumber of reasons. Sometimes, they have committed taboos (personal) against otherbeings either inside or outside their systems who have taken revenge; sometimes,they have taken on parasitic indwellers such as different kinds of diseases. There aremethods and dealing with all these. Sometimes, they have simply squandered theirluck like I did.Interestingly, the sessions generally have very good results but the results arenever noted immediately. Generally, the take up to two to three weeks before theeffects are noted by the client. The only payment and I’ve never received is a hardy“thanks,” and I have never been thanked and less than two years after a session.Apparently, it takes quite a long while for the healing process to advance enough forthe client to realize what has happened. These weird timeframes have often puzzledme. However, while the sick may be very slow at consciously realizing their ownhealing, the dying are very quick."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman2108.3. The Quick Dead:Early on I noticed how crowded graveyards seemed to be. I could walk into agraveyard and the place would be almost the deafening. Sometimes the ghosts wouldwant my attention because flowers were tipped over at the gravesite sometimes theywished only to greet me. I’ve seen happy ghosts, sad ones, and disturbed ones. Onetime I entered a graveyard in southwest Virginia and the ghosts were all bickeringwith one another and gossiping (this was not a fun graveyard to be in).I was curious from the outset why graveyards seemed to be so populated if thedead supposedly moved on to a Land of the Dead. It seemed odd that Christianswere not in either Heaven or Hell. In working with the sick it is common for me toencounter entire towns of the dead but still I notice that the graveyards seemed to befull. This was explained me this way: The dead do not go to either Heaven or Hellrather they go to villages of their ancestors. These villages never seem full mainlybecause space in time are severely distorted in the other world. The graveyard, orspecifically the grave, is an entry point to the village of the dead. It is also the pointwhere the Flow of Waters occurs. An individual’s ancestral luck flows from the graveof his family or his most immediate ancestor. By caring for grave of an immediateancestor an individual is grooming the pathway through which the Waters flow. Ifthis is neglected, particularly in a malicious way, the flow of ancestral luck can bestopped. If the individual is low in the area of personal luck, he will become ill. Thegrave then is the connecting point between this world and the other world.Catholics and other Christians have a tendency to call their particular ancestralvillage \"Heaven.\" \"Hell\" is created for an individual when he is ostracized by hisancestral village and is driven out into the Wasteland. This place, I suppose, can feeleither hot or cold but is certainly uncomfortable for the individual mainly becausethey’re not in the fold of their ancestors. The same holds true for heathens as well.I always wanted to believe that heathens would somehow be different than Chris-tians and that we have a better place to go to after death, but the bottom-line seemsto be that we simply go to our ancestral home regardless of our religious affiliations.By the way, from what I can see, the dead worship in the same fashion as the living.Christians go to churches, and I would guess that heathens wind up worshiping aloneas they often do here on Midgard (heathens, as a group, are too small to really havesomething like a church). I have to smile to myself when I hear heathens say “I amgoing to Asgard when I die” or “I am going to Thrundheim after death.” As far as Ican tell, we really do just go to our graves and from there go to our ancestral homes(or to the Wasteland if we are jerks and wind up being ostracized). In life, I guessmany people have to make themselves feel somewhat ‘special’ by bragging that theyare going to sit at the right hand of their personal King after death.As I stated earlier, I work in the medical field. For a period of about five"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman211years I worked in a long-term care setting with people suffering from Alzheimer’sdisease. We have about 150 patients at any given time, and in any year’s time,we will lose about one-third of the population. In other words, they come to ourfacility to die. This provided me early on with a lot of experience and dealingboth with the dying as well as the newly dead. Additionally, these people camefrom all different religions: Jewish, Hindu, Catholic, fundamentalist, and severaldifferent Native American religions. Knowing what I know now about death, it wasrelatively easy to work with anyone who was either dying or newly dead becausethey would all be going to one place: the ancestral home.Fear was the biggest problem for any of the ones who were dying. More oftenthan not, by the time I was able to work with them, they were already beginning tosplit away from their body. I am well acquainted with the fear that splitting awayfrom the body can induce an individual since I suffered from it for about two years.8.4. Disease Is Everywhere:I am a seiðman. I don’t do what is commonly called ‘Oracular Seið.’ I go inbehind the scenes, diagnose a problem for a client, and then do what is necessary toremediate the problem. In many cases I’m working with what is commonly called’disease.’ In some other cases I help the dying get to where they need to go so thatthey do not cause problems here on Midgard.Because of my work I tend to view disease differently than say, for example, aphysician. For a physician, and for most of the modern world, disease is caused bybacteria, virii, or parasites. In other cases there is definite damage to the neurologicalsystem (caused by trauma from the outside) or to the physical system. From us seiðstandpoint, disease is quite different. Disease is for the seiðman anything whichcauses the individual discomfort to the point where he is no longer functioningnormally. For general purposes, I view diseases as stemming from one of the followingcategories:1. Fear induced – fear is one of the commonest causes of disease in both the ancientand modern worlds. A review of charms and magical spells from undevelopedareas such as Samiland, Korea, Java, the Australian outback, Africa, and SouthAmerica will reveal a high percentage of remedies for fear.2. Indwelling disease – indwelling disease is what doctors often report as causingflu, colds, pneumonias, etc. from scientific standpoint of these are generallyassociated with germs and microorganisms. From the seiðman’s point of view,the indweller is a separate being who has gotten lost or separated from his truehome. The indweller must either be driven out or somehow led back to his home."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman2123. Physical disease – physical disease is generally related to damage to the body. Inthis day and age these are best left to physicians and surgeons although I havetreated some any emergencies particularly the stoppage of flow of blood.4. Taboo – Asatru does not have sets of taboos like other religions do such as Islam,Christianity, Judaism, or Hinduism. On the other hand, however, we have theconcept of debt either paid or unpaid. And unpaid debt can often be the sourceof discomfort to the individual. In many cases, the individual has transgressedanother’s property or person unwittingly and has left the dead unpaid so thatthe transgressee has a need to either consciously or unconsciously gain revenge.Fear is by far the most common cause of disease. If the seiðman confine the baseof fear it can be treated and the fear itself will dissipate. Fear is associated highlywith physical discomfort, stomach disorders, nervous disorders, and headaches. Itcan also be associated with muscle aches and pains and back problems. Treatmentof fear for the ancients was very important and there’s a large body of folkloresurrounding it and Scandinavian, Finnish, West Germanic, Celtic, and Spanish.For the most part fear is the foundation for all negative feelings and emotions. Ingeneral, there are only two feelings (although they run on a continuum between eachother): fear and love. Actually, these could be better divided from comfortable touncomfortable with fear being at the uncomfortable end. The fine division points onthe continuum are usually unnamed. Most people confuse ’feelings’ with ’emotions’but emotions are really how the individual chooses to respond and/or express howhe or she is feeling at any given moment. For example, an individual may feel fearbut depending on the image that he is trying to present to the rest of the world hemay express that fear as1. being scared2. anger3. jealousy4. envy5. irritation6. agitation7. aggression8. confusion9. or may simply ignore it all together.The above list are emotions. The word ‘emotion’ is related to the verb ‘emote’ whichmeans to express oneself – it is usually used among actors regarding how well orhow poorly an actor expresses feelings to an audience. In a sense, we are all actorsexpressing feelings to our audience which is the rest of the world."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman213Of all be emotions, for the seiðman, jealousy/ envy are the most dangerous.Oddly enough this also holds true for the South American Hispanics as well. AndScandinavian folklore jealousy is treated as a disease and is calledelske(and SouthAmerica it is calledenvídeoand is closely related tosusto(fear) andgrano(envy).Both the Germanic and Hispanic areas treat the problem similarly: find the individ-ual against whom the fear is directed and set things straight. (Noticed that I use theterm ‘fear’ in the above sentence. This is not an accident. Fear when it is related tojealousy or envy is the fear that one will not get one’s due or fear of loss or fear thatone will fall behind socially.) Jealousy or envy is particularly dangerous because oneis using all one’s energy to attack the individual against whom the fear is directed.These specific emotions become very time-consuming and energy intensive to thepoint where one begins to neglect himself and his duties to others. If taken to anextreme it can even become the basis of some mental breakdowns.Hunger is a simple fear. It is the fear of death. It is generally handled by thebody and one simply goes out to seek food. Social fears on the other hand arefar more complex. Fears can be generated by the loss of a loved one or of a goodfriend (anguish or extreme sadness/ depression); fears of loss of social standing(these are often related to sex issues or material issues but can be more complexsuch as in affairs which result in discrediting a competitor). The fear of being alonecan be great and devastating. The Elder Edda speaks much about the importanceof friendship. This is not a quaint fluke. Man is an extremely social animal andneeds to interact with other human beings. If this need is not addressed as beingas important as any other type of hunger the individual can easily sicken, go mad,become sociopathic, or die. When dealing with humans there is no such thing asThe Lone Wolf. Fear, then, is a major cause of disease in human beings.The treatment of fear is crucial but can be very complex. The complexity offear exists because the individual often does not recognize fears being the basisof his disease. There is a great reluctance among modern people to discuss fear,particularly personal fears, amongst one another because “If you know my fears, youknow how to attack me.” From the seiðman’s point of view the best way to removefear is to confront it directly and then move from the high level of discomfort to amore comfortable level; health, both mental and physical, will be quickly restored.I worked once with a woman who had not slept in 17 nights. She had beenaddicted to sleeping pills and decided to wean herself from them. Her disease wasfear based. Human beings cannot go indefinitely without sleep so she was sure to fallasleep at some point, but her fear kept her awake for 17 full days. The session withher lasted almost four hours. As it turns out she had previously been an alcoholicand started taking the sleeping pills basically to replace the depressive effect thatshe once gained from drinking. When she quit drinking, she also cut back severely"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman214on her social life, her creative activities such as dancing and art, and sex becauseall these activities, for her, were related to her abuse of alcohol. Her fear then hadoriginally started when she decided to quit drinking and became scared that anyother activity she engaged in would take her back to drinking.It was necessary to have long session with her because my ghosts needed to leadme to all the different places where she had stashed her fears. I had to see anexperience for myself the mess that she had made out of her internal life. The curewas relatively simple once the information was gained. I discussed with her the needfor her to regain her creative and social aspects of herself. I described for her thedesert that she had created for herself inside, and the withered plant life, and firesthat she had let burn down. It was important for her to discuss these things andshe did so with a sense of relief. Additionally, I created a remedy (created for me byone of my ghosts) to help put her to sleep. I gave her the remedy was a prescriptionfor its use – she only had to use it one night. Two years later, after she got marriedand started up her artwork again, she thanked me profusely.I’ve worked with individuals who were severely depressed, who felt as thoughthey had lost all their luck, who felt as though they had lost all their personalpower, who were overcome by the death of a child or other loved one, or who couldnot find a mate. All these were fear based problems and all of them required differenttypes of sessions and different types of cures.One session that I can remember required a period of three days. The womanwas brought to me by a friend. The client was almost manic when I first met her.After the diagnosis of plan was drawn up by the ghosts who work with me andmyself. It was to be a three-part session: the first part would be to take her out toa special canyon nearby home and disengage her ’self’ from her body – my friendand I ’tied’ her ghost body to some rocks and left it to the care of the ghosts incanyon; the second session was for me to fly back to the canyon alone and talk withher ghost body – that time we were able to untangle many knots which were causingher to be somewhat dysfunctional; and the third session we took the young womanback out to the canyon to reassemble her. Of course, there are a lot of details leftout here but this was the general course of action.After a period of three or four months, the woman began working for the firsttime in several years. I happened to see her at a wedding about a year after thesession, and her presence there was very striking for almost anyone who saw her.She still has a tendency to be slightly manic when she feels very comfortable witha person that she has become.Hers was a disease that was completely fear based but went as far back as earlyadolescence. It has completely ruined her life to the point where she had becomean unemployable recluse. I see people on a daily basis whose lives are being ruined"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman215by their inability to address their own fears, and have watched people die from this.Why this is not addressed by the modern medical profession as being an importantaspect of mental and physical health, I do not know. The general method by themedical profession for treating fear is to suppress it with drugs. Although it can becomplex and somewhat confusing to deal with, treatment for it especially when itis successful makes the doctor looked like a miracle worker.Indwellers are generally recognized by the medical profession as being some formicroorganism which interferes with the normal functioning of the body. Generallythis is also the case for the seiðman. When an indweller is the cause of disease inindividual, I make sure that the individual is under the care of a physician while I amseeing him. This is very important because the medical profession is very good atweakening microorganisms. However, why microorganism has invaded individual’sbody at this point in time is rarely addressed by the medical profession. Sometimesthe doctor will address eating habits, social habits, or sleep patterns but beyondthis the physicians rarely go. This is the job of the seiðman.Let me explain something about microorganisms. I work in a hospital andour infection control department did a study at one point to determine how manyhealth-care workers in the hospital had a particular type of pneumonia bacteriumcolonized, i.e. living inside them. The specific bacterium was related to MRSA(methycillin resistant staphalococcus aureous); this is one of the so-called superpneumonias which response to very few medications and the medicine that is usedto treat it is often dangerous for the patient. They found that 70 percent of all thepeople working in direct care had MRSA colonized in the nasal passages. As it turnsout, the reason why none of the health-care workers ever became infected was thattheir bodies and their minds were in good health; this only when the health beginsto fail that the disease, the indweller, is able to take hold.Most people inhale hundreds of virii everyday and they do not become ill. Simplecontact with indwellers does not produce disease. Now we’re back to my originalpoint: Germs do not cause disease. The process for ending up with a disease which iscaused by an indweller is fairly simple. The individual must be unhealthy physicallyand/or mentally in the first place. Curing a disease of this type is a two-prongedapproach.The first prong should be the area of physicians. I work with physicians daily andother capabilities. From my point of view a physician is a poisoner. It is their jobto go in and find out what type of microorganisms are living inside the individualresulting in the current set of problems, and then they look through the PDR,Physician’s (Poisoner’s) Desk Reference, to determine which type of medicationwill poison the specific microorganism. Physicians, contrary to common New Agebelief, are an important asset to the field of physical health; they should never be"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman216denigrated. It is far easier for an individual to recover from a disease caused by anindweller if the microorganism itself is either weak or dead.The second prong falls into my arena. I want to know why the indweller came tolive with the individual in the first place. I do not view indwellers as microorganisms.For me, they are beings, ghosts, who for whatever reason had become associated withtheir own home and have taken up residence in this individual. Did the individualinvite the microorganism in? Did the individual damage his own defense systemsso then an aggressive indweller could come in? Is the indweller therefore specificreason? The latter is often the case with elderly individuals who are scared to die.Nursing homes are often rampant with pneumonia, for example.When I first encountered this ghost-disease I was appalled at how completelyvicious and ruthless he was what these poor people. I hated this disease becauseI would see the elderly sitting in their rooms, often on their beds, coughing spas-modically for hours on end. Their energy levels would be extremely low so thatthey would often fall asleep in midconversation. The appetites dropped to rockbottom sometimes not eating for periods of two or three days at a time. Their lustfor life would disappear often not caring if they lived or died. They would oftenlose 20-25In working with the elderly, especially those consigned to nursing homes,I realized that these people are living in fear constantly. Many of them are at stageV or VI dementia secondary to Alzheimer’s disease. There now living in a ’strangeplace’ with strangers taking care of them often performing acts on them that arenormally reserved for infants (such as changing adult-diapers and cleaning them afteran accident or spoon-feeding them pureed foods). They fear that they are losingor have already lost their children and their families, their status within family andcommunity, and most of all, their minds and memories. The elderly, unless theycan be cared for in the home with specific roles to play within family setting, livein constant fear. The gift that pneumonia brings his release from fear. Pneumoniaallows the elderly to sleep, to dream, and to lose fear of death. If it’s job is notinterfered with, pneumonia will lead the elderly to the Land of Their Ancestors in aquiet, relatively painless, and fearlessly smooth fashion. It is important to determineif the indweller is there to perform service or not.If the indweller is simply lost or is aggressively attacking the individual, my jobis then to treat the individual to bring him back to a state of wholeness. Oftendiets, sleep patterns, fears, and habits need to be addressed. Occasionally, debts,usually to ghosts of places or ancestors, need to be uncovered, addressed, and paid.When these things are done, the indweller himself needs to be addressed and eitherasked to leave or forced to do so. The success of the cure is highly dependent uponthe client’s willingness to act.Debts or transgressions can also be the cause of disease particularly skin diseases"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman217such as hives or rash. From a Germanic point of view all debts must be paid.Consciously, an individual needs to be respectful when he enters the territory ofanother. Ghosts-of-place such as certain river- or stream-ghosts are particularlyjealous of the lands that they lord over. Certain plants do not like to be touchedor bothered in any way. In Iceland, road crews have discovered that it is best togo around certain rocks or other landmarks rather than to put up with the ill luckfollowing the removal of such a landmark. These can often be easily diagnosed andresolved.Modern times has brought with it the phenomenon of the ’nuclear family.’ Theseare generally very small families which are also very mobile. Because of the highmobility there is also poor attachment to place and specifically to ancestral placessuch as farms or graveyards. Additionally, modern times tends to downplay theneed to honor ancestry as being folk superstition. The seiðman’s point of view, andthat of the Norse revivalists as well as folk from undeveloped Third World countries,is that the ancestors must be honored because it is from the ancestors that all luckflows.Diagnosis of this kind of problem is usually fairly easy because the client willgenerally complain of ’bad luck’ always coming his way. Some changes can usuallybe made inside the client which will result in his altering his own views towards hisown ancestors. Results from this kind of session are usually fairly immediate withinfour or five days.Disease is not the only area that this seiðman has spent much time dealing with.Because of my job and because of my clientele I was confronted almost on a dailybasis with either the dying or newly dead. These were of concern to me becausethe newly dead can often cause their living descendants problems either by blockingthe flow of the waters, i.e. luck, or by simple harassment. Normally when a persondies they were simply leave the Land of the Living and move on. However, religiouspractice is becoming slightly less common even among the elderly, and death hasbeen removed from the home setting to the sterile setting of the hospital resultingan increase in fear about death with far less acceptance of death as being part oflife.I first began to notice the dying while I was still under the care of theghostpneumonia. I could ‘see’ that the individual’s ghost-body was beginning to peelaway from the corpse. Often the patients body was lying on the bed while the ghostwas sitting astride. I had the audacity to speak with several of these but it was clearfrom their answers that they were sure what was happening to them. Sometimesthey felt as though they were dreaming; and other times they were completelyconfused. It was clear that they were in the process of leaving but there was alwaysone portion of their ghost ’stuck’ to the corpse usually in an area near their butt."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman218It was obvious to me what was going on only after their death. The confusion theseindividuals suffered puzzled me for some time.After about one year I began to develop a plan for working with the dying. Iwould walk into a room and address both the body and the ghost. I would ask themif they knew what was going on (the answer was inevitably a resounding ‘No’),and after they responded, I would tell them point-blank that they were dying. Atfirst, I thought this would cause some fear in the individual but it never workedthat way. Rather than fear they became curious and would begin asking questionsabout “Why can you see me?”, “Where to go from here?”, and the scary one for me“How do I know where to go?” Because I live in New Mexico, I have worked mostoften with Roman Catholics so rather than get into an argument about religion Iwould tell them to call out for their mothers. Often they would state that theycould either hear their mothers’ voices or that they could see them (I never couldsee their mothers, but they could). Occasionally, especially with the newly dead, Iwould have to show them how to move, how to pass through walls, how to fly, and inwhich direction they needed to go. I never told any of them that I was a heathen; Isimply told them that I could only lead them up to the gate of Heaven, but that onlythey were allowed to pass through. They all excepted this is a reasonable answerand never questioned further.The Christian Land of the Dead has very tight borders with good security. Idoubt very much that I could easily slipped inside without being noticed or withoutbeing harmed. One time I was at the Christian wedding with my wife. We decidedto take some time off and combine a small vacation with going to one of her friend’sweddings. The wedding was held in a very pretty Catholic Church. I was feelingquite uncomfortable being in there but persevered for my wife’s and her friend’ssake. Even though I was feeling uncomfortable, I still had the audacity to mocksome of the prayers silently. This was a mistake. I didn’t realize the extent ofmy actions until one of the candle lanterns at the end of the pew (actually, almostabove my head) exploded and shot shards of glass all over me. I was able to saveface before the Christian security forces and picked up one of the pieces of glass,smiled, and stuck in my pocket. When I went outside at the end of mass I made surethat caught the attention of the Christian security forces and tossed the bit of glassinto the gutter. I made sure to let them know that the gutter outside their churchwas the domain of the Thunderer. My wife later told me that it was probably nota good idea for me to enter too many churches.Of all the jobs that I have done as the seiðman by far the most satisfying wasworking with the newly dead. We were able to resolve the problems quickly andefficiently and the client, the newly dead, was immediately grateful."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman2198.5. On the Gathering of Plants:As a stated in the very beginning of this book, I grew up in a small town in ruralMichigan and I started collecting herbs for medicine at a very early age around 9or 10 years old. I studied herbalism diligently until I was about 17 when I movedfrom Michigan to the Black Hills of South Dakota. The herbs and South Dakota arequite a bit different than those in Michigan and rather than have to learn a wholenew set of herbs, I decided to take only the ones I knew and ignore the rest. Atthat time, though, I discovered and herb which would become very important in myseið-making, prairie sage. It is a very low growing plant which grows abundantlyfrom South Dakota, west to Washington, and south to the American Southwestwhere I now reside. At that time, I used herbs primarily for their chemical qualitiesas medicines. I knew that Native Americans used prairie sage to clear out evilinfluences but I really didn’t understand the process behind it. Herbs, for me, wereplants which had specific properties related to their chemical makeup. I continuedto believe this until the winter of 1992.The dreams that I had in the winter of 1992 bothered me. For the first timeI was confronted with the idea that plants were not really ‘plants.’ The dreamsseemed to indicate that plants were really ghosts who resided in stationary bodiesrather than mobile bodies like animals or people, but beyond this they were almostno different than animals or people. I began to view plants as creatures completewith personalities, personal quirks, personal agendas, and mentation.In the early summer of 1992 and began to collect herbs for medicine again forthe first time in about 10 or 15 years. It was the first time that I never collectedherbs where I had to take into consideration the plants as creatures. I actually felta need to ask them to help me and what they needed from me in terms of respectfor what they were.The rules that the plant-ghosts set down vary slightly from plant to plant, butthere are some commonalities.1. First, for every group of plants growing there is either a grandfather or grand-mother who needs to be approached first before any plants are harvested. Theyneed to be greeted formally with a good show of respect. They are, after all, theelder of their clan. They also need to know exactly who is picking from them.Usually, they require that a bit of hair be left with them as a show of faith butsometimes they may also ask for tobacco, blood, or alcohol.2. Picking should be done slowly and with a sense of respect.3. Preferably, plants should be plucked or pulled from the ground rather than cut.Cutting is very disrespectful. Pulling or plucking demonstrates the intent ofthe healer/ wholemaker while cutting resembles somebody who is simply taking"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman220herbs as part of a business. It’s the same difference as treating a client has ahuman being or treating them as a potential paycheck (if potential paycheckfeels like the right answer the reader probably needs to start the book from page1 and not skip any chapters).4. Roots should be taken from the ground by loosening the dirt around it witheither a shovel or knife and then the dirt is removed from the root by knockingit off against the shovel blade or the ground. The dirt should be placed back inthe hole.Time needs to be spent with the herbs. Sit down and take the time. If you havethe ear or the eye for it (second sight), you can learn many things. Often an herbis ‘known’ for a specific thing but hidden uses as well. For example, prairie sage isknown for it’s effect that it has on the digestive system, but a lesser known use isthe clarity of vision that it can offer one in a seið session. Sometimes the seiðman’svision will cloud and inhale the smoke from a ball of sage will help clear the eyesand ears. Manzanilla, or chamomile, can be added to a medicine to ‘quicken’ or‘liven’ it. Willow or chaparrel can be used as a weapon against ghosts when needed.Just sitting down and listening to the plant-elder of the clan is a wonderful teachingtool.When using plants for curing, I learned that the herbs should come from one’slocale. The rationale for this is that the diseases, particularly the indwellers, are fromthe same region as the seiðman who is acting as the Wholemaker. If the seiðman isusing the method that I described above, the ghosts of the herbs collected will oftenhelp out in finding a cure. Additionally, there are often other ghosts who know theherbs of an area. For example, there is one whom I know and whom I will visiteither to check on a cure or, if I am stumped, to get direction on creating a cure.Sometimes the ghost of the disease itself will recommend or hint at a cure from thelocal area.When I go out to collect, I almost always am by myself. I like the quiet. WhenI collect, I am never alone. The plants talk; they sing; they will often make lightjokes. I am a social person and enjoy another’s company immensely, and when I amcollecting, I am never alone.Three plants probably need separate mention. I already mentioned the prairiesage. She is probably one of the most powerful herbs that I know especially whenit comes to vision. Another is the Little Red Man. I have written about him quitea bit. I do not consider him to be an herb or plant–he is most definitely a creatureand a creature who not only can move like an animal or person but one who canmove very quickly. One time I was climbing a mountain, going up to a sacred lakewhich lies at about 10,500 ft. From the point where I leave the car up to the lakeis about an hour and a half walk (sometimes a little longer). The journey is fairly"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman221strenuous. There are three steep sections before the lake and each section usuallyrequires a short break before continuing on. This particular time I was travelingwith the Little Red Man and was hunting him in the forests on the way up to thelake. He seemed in a very frivolous mood on this day and was making a number oflight jokes. I knew that we were traveling quickly but what I didn’t realize is thatwe would make the trip in 45 mins.! I’m not sure that I could do the trip on myown in that amount of time even if I were on flat ground!There are times in a seið-session where the Little Red Man offers to run thejourney to where it is that we need to go. He very much likes to travel to the Northto visit a strange man called the Reindeer Man who is a giant of a man and whoherds reindeer. This man has answers about how to find answers. He seems to knoweverybody and every place and if he does not, he knows how to get to the answerquickly. The Little Red Man also has an herb-doctor friend who lives in a cottage ina forest to the Southeast. As far as I can tell, her only job is making medicines fromlocal plants. She seems to know cures for everything. All in all the Little Red Manis a great traveling companion, he is fun (for the most part–he does have a small bitof a nasty streak which can involve incredible nausea and diarrhea, though).The preparation for the Little Red Man varies slightly from session to session.His strength also varies to some degree and this can be related to the individualmushrooms used, what was eaten within the last 24 hrs. or the seiðman’s frame ofmind. If one has a prediliction for becoming a companion of the Little Red Man, hewill choose you, teach and coach you.The other plant is by far the most dangerous that I know with the exceptionof hemlock or monkshood–he is called Toloache here in New Mexico, but his latinname isdatura meteloides. Now there are other daturas which grow here and infact some of them are safer to use than this one, but this is the only one who hasadopted me.The collection of the plant is done in the the twilight of the morning when sheis in full bloom. Notice that I say ‘she’–the ghost is a dark noble woman, royalty,but the seiðmaker will never get to deal with her directly because she is protectedclosely by a warrior of immense strength and courage. Unfortunately, his treatmentof visitors to his queen is poor. Not only can and will he challenge you but if careis not taken, he can harm severely. He cannot be tricked, nor does he even listen.His only job is to protect the queen at all cost.The medicines made with this ghost are potent! If the ghost, through her warriortranslator, decides to help a seiðman procure a cure for a client, she will do so atlightening speed. Sometimes this feels like what it must be to get caught in anavalanche of a tidal wave. The power and speed are often very disorienting. She has"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman222Figure 8.1. The seiðman with Fliegenpilze"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman223no sense of humor like the Little Red Man and is there simply to do a job. I doubtif she even cares if the seiðman himself lives or dies. With the Little Red Man thereexists a personality to interact with; with Toloache and her warrior, there is none.The question often comes up as to why a seiðman would use psychoactives duringa curing session. The question is wrong, however, because the asker is forgettingthat the seiðman is part of a team. The one who calls the shots on how to go aboutgaining a cure is rarely the seiðman. I play an important role, for sure, but being theplanner of a scheme is not one of them. My job is primarily to put the cure togetherhere on Midgard after the cure has been designed and after the ‘backgound’ hasbeen managed, i.e. those arrangements which need to be made in the Otherworld.My role is really that of liaison between the worlds. The question about why theseiðman would use a psychoactive plant really has no better answer than asking anail why it is hit by a hammer. In both cases the ‘design’ is everything and neitherthe nail nor the seiðman play any significant role in the design stage.8.6. On Cleanliness:When I first began being visited by the ghosts back in 1991, I knew nothing of‘cleanliness.’ For sure, I took a bath every day and brushed my teeth twice a day,but I did not understand what it meant to be clean. I did not understand that theWaters must flow unimpeded; in fact, I did not even know what the Waters were.Here I should take a little time and review this concept. As the Waters flowthrough the three (or nine) homes from well to well making a complete circle so dothey flow through man. There is an inflow and an outflow area. On many, at leastwhen I am working with them, the Waters flow in through the top of the head anmain course of the internal river flows through the trunk, splits at the crotch andexits through the feet. The arms can either be inflow or outflow estuaries dependingupon the need at the time. Usually, when I am working with a client, I will watchthe flow of Waters. I will put their hands down along their sides (to make an outflowarea at the hands), then I will watch how the efficiency of the flow increases anddecreases as I point their head in different directions. While one may have themost efficient flow with his head in the east, another will do best if the head is inthe southwest. The directions have no significant meanings as they do for NativeAmericans and Wiccans at least not for this work.Secondly, I will watch their insides to see where the flow becomes constricted.Often, this is noticed most in the joints especially the the shoulders and hips, butconstrictions can occur anywhere in the system. When I locate these constrictions(everyone will have a few) I will rearrange their body to improve the flow. Before Ido any other work on them I want to maximize the flow of the Waters."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman224A weak flow at the inflow area is often related to unpaid debts (see above). Some-times inflow can be improved simply by the client addressing certain transgressionsoften against ancestors. Ancestors can hold back on the flow of Waters if they feelslighted or forgotten. Sometimes there is no transgression but the flow can oftenstill be improved by addressing the ancestors since this is one of our primary sourcesof luck (note: luck = efficiency in the flow of the Waters). As the flow increases, sodoes luck in a proportional fashion. I heard from a friend who is well versed in themartial arts that the flow of the Waters resembleschiwith the main difference beingthat for the seiðman there is no system to be written down as with acupuncture.The process for repair is basically observation, make changes, re-observe for theeffect that the changes made, and so on.Inside the landscape of the body of the client the Wholemaker may need to makechanges by removing dams from the river, rocks, trash and so on, or by changingthe course of the river slightly by, for example, building up dams at the riversideto force a split flow to run together. The more efficient and energetic the flow, the‘cleaner’ the river. Clean river = increased energy and and increased luck.As the Wholemaker does his work, he learns about what cleanliness means.Cleanliness is certainly related to a healthy clean physical body, but there are otherpurifications which can be done. These are always done in the same manner as onewould do for a client although the approach varies somewhat.My first cleansing came about when the bird of prey ripped open my head sothat there was a large gaping hole there. The wind came roaring through from thetop of my head on down. This was early on before I understood what cleanlinessmeant, but my luck instantly increased to the point where I missed being in a severecar crash only moments later (needless to say, I wasimpressedby the large increaseof luck so suddenly because the car crash had been my destiny up to that point–itwas meant for me).Over a time I learned to wash out my insides by using water from an Otherworldriver, by asking a ghost-squirrel whom I know to gnaw open frozen joints and pas-sages, by allowing the winds to blow through to melt out icy constrictions, by usingsmokes from herbs (especially powerful is the prairie sage), and by using certainherbal preparations. Cleaning up the insides so that the flow is efficient is the mostimportant act a human can engage in.Sitting in certain areas are beneficial and can improve the flow of Waters. An-cestral graveyards are important places of power. Of course it is important to honorone’s ancestors since this is a primary source of luck, but we are a very mobileculture and do not always live near our ancestral homes. A good secondary sourceof luck (or least a good way to avert transgressions against the ghosts of a strangeplace) is to visit the local graveyards where one lives. Honoring the dead of one’s"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman225newhometownespecially during the period between Thanksgiving and mid-Januarywhen the ghosts are active can help align one with the town’s luck. It doesn’t haveto be some grandiose ceremony–this is not about impressing my neighbors abouthow eccentric I am–all I have to do is stroll through the graveyard, read the stonesperhaps, and listen. I am always polite in strange graveyards. As one who hadsquandered away all his personal luck before the age of 40 winters, I can use allthe luck I can get. Also working with the dying and newly dead paid off well forme because it provided with a handful of ghosts who were willing to ‘put in a goodword’ for me.Hole-sitting is a good exercise for when thepressuresare becoming too great. Itcan be as simple or as ceremonial as one likes since it is done alone. Personally, I cannot personally stand pomp and grandiosity and have a difficult time dealing withothers who engage in it. Hole-sitting is simple in essence: find or make a depressionin the earth (not a ditch). It must be about up to one’s chest on all sides and thedepression should be about 6 ft.-8 ft. in diameter with fairly gently sloping sides.The process is simple: go there about an hour before sundown, sit in it dead-centerfacing whichever direction is most comfortable (directions should be functional, notsymbolic–personally, I’m most comfortable facing anywhere from west to north),and sit through the twilight until dark without moving from the spot. Scootingone’s butt around to maintain good blood flow and moving the legs for the samereason are both fully acceptable. The important thing is to keep everything fromthe breastbone downwards below the level of the earth, and from the breastboneupwards above the level of the earth. The effect of hole-sitting is to stabilize theflow of Waters within one’s self.Keeping one’s system clean is crucial for maintaining the flow of the Waters. For35 years I did not think about the relationship between my emotions and the flowof Waters. First, I did not comprehend ‘the Flow.’ I believed that I was runningunder my own steam; I believed I created reality with my might and main. I thoughtthat when I die the world, indeed, the universe–everything that can be known orperceived–would collapse with me. I could not accept that I was but a small cog ina large watch: I figured that Iwasthe watch! My luck, my power wasmine, grantedto me upon my birth into this Midgard. The disease-ghost pneumonia help put thatmisbelief into proper perspective. Secondly, I could not perceive any relationshipbetween my emotions, my physical health, and the effect that my emotions wouldhave on the rest of the world and my relationship to it.The Hávamál has much to say about the maintenance of friendships and alludesto why it is important toactin specific ways. Prior to the madness in late 1991, Ithought the perscriptions in the Hávamál were merely suggestions. At the time, Ididn’t see the need to ‘groom’ relationships."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Chapter 8.

These are views of what a human actually looks likebehind the scenes.One ghost showed me how a human really does not exist as an individual being.He showed med me a large net which extends out infinitely in all directions.“A human is really little more than a small knot in this large net. See?Here you are (he points). When I move this string or this one which is nearyou, your knot-position becomes immediatly affected. “If I move this one (alittle further away), you are still severely affected, but it is difficult for youto see the actual path of relationship between this event and yourself. Thisrelationship is more difficult for a person to understand. Worked out, though,it is still a logical turn of events. “If I move this one here (much further away)you are only slightly affected, but your neighbors are more so affected. Youhave no way of understanding this relationship between the original event andyouself besides it becomes really complex when one of your neighbors respondsinappropriately. See? It’s good to pick and choose your close friends wisely.Interaction with them will inevitably determine your needs to respond.”The grooming of relationships is very important for how luck will turn: it can eitherbe increased by good friendships with the right people or made poor by improperaction or improper choices on my part.At some other point, another ghost showed me this image, a small brook withlittle eddies and whirlpools:“See the whirlpool there? See how short it’s life is? That is another humanbeing dying. You humans are little more than little whirlpools or eddies inthe large Flow of the Waters from the original Well. You have a birth, alife-span, and then you weaken to the point where you disappear. That ishow you appear to us. As a whirlpool you waste time believing that you havea separate existence from others, but in fact you all come from the sameWaters.”For a long time, I thought I created my own existence. Back then, I felt no needto reinforce the others around me. Now, I know my existence is dependent uponothers around me. I take care to groom my relationships with family and friends. Ipay attention to how I treat others. I no longer feel justified in destroying them formaterial gain because it really results in material loss and disease."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman227As a Wholemaker, my ‘cures’ are often centered around untangling the knots thatpeople have made with their lives. This type of disease is to a great part self-induced.Unfortunately, the cure is often often transient because if the individual does notchange his repertory of action, he returns quickly with a completely separate set ofknotty relationships. The best Wholemaker that I know for dealing with this type ofdisease is the disease-ghost, pneumonia. He alone can cause the client to completelyrevamp his way of action. I’ve seen him perform miracles with some of the nastiestpeople I’ve ever met. On the other hand, if the client cannot change, he kills them.8.7. On ceremony:The session that I conduct is very different from the standard New Age ‘cere-mony.’ In fact, one of my sessions is so different I don’t even like to use the sameterm for it. I usually just call it a ‘session’ or more simply ‘acting properly.’Actually, there is little difference at one level between ‘grooming relationships’andceremony. There are proper actions for everything (This is something thatI did not want to hear 20 years ago!). There are proper actions to take duringbathing, eating, preparing for sleep, building a fire, drinking water—everything.Proper actions should really be defined asthose actions which result in benefit for the actor, for the environment, and forothers in the environment, i.e. which result in the increase in the efficiencyof the Flow of Waters.Most of these kinds of actions are very subtle and are rarely noticed by others.In the past, most of my actions had nothing to do with my knowledge of the ofthe Flow of the Waters. They were usually done so that I could impress someone(usually a female or a boss). I had a relentless need to demonstrate for people‘howspecial I am.’ My gestures and my voice were always grandiose. I was under thedistinct impression that if a great number of people were impressed my status wouldbe increased. Many of the so-called ceremonies that I have attended over the yearssince the onset of my making as a seiðman were really nothing more than a carefuldesign to showcase the High Priest or High Priestess. On the other hand, I havebeen with Native American medicine people who really understood the rationalebehind proper action and its effects–there actions were always subtle and gracefuleven in the most formal settings.Engaging in proper action is similar to playing in a jazz band. Playing aninstrument is a complicated affair. First one to learn to finger all the notes, thenlearn the licks and scales, and then practice (often for years) to get that which islearned up to speed. But playing in a band (and doing it well) is only partially"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman228dependent on individual skill on one’s instrument. The most important skill in aband is not skill at the instument, however, it is the musician’s abilty tolistentothe band as a whole and then add in only those notes which will enhance the overallsound. A grave mistake often made by many young musicians is that in their desireto climb up the musical ladder of fame, they center only only their own sound andskill ignoring the bigger picture. I know this well because I had made the error overand over for years wondering why my skill as a fiddle player was not lauded by allwho heard–I was slowly losing friends rather than gaining them. It was only while Iwas in the throes of my madness that I learned the subtle skill of hearing/ listening.A handful of clean, well-placed notes can often do more for a tune than a stunningrun of complex scales. The notes need to be carefully placed out there and then theplayer must be able to hear the effect to judge the skill of placement. So it is with‘proper action’; thisisproper action.My seiðmaking sessions start out quietly with dialog. I need to know the clientand his perception of his own problems. Often, I begin to prepare the session placeat this time. I roll up little balls of prairie sage, place my tools (none of them areoverly impressive in looks–just rocks, little feathers, sticks, etc.). After finding outthe client’s perception of the problem, I will begin to sing my ghosts together. Thesong is quiet with no words–just sounds and tones. My vocal volume is low. Theghosts aren’t deaf and I am not here toimpressa client, but to find a proper courseof action which will relieve him of his problem. The ghosts will look at the problemand will decide if Toloache or the Little Red Man are necessary to achieve the goal.If I must work work with the Little Red Man we will often take a break whileI make the preparations. Toloache requires little preparation and there is no timelag waiting for him to take where I need to go. The Fly Agaric is much slower bothin preparation and waiting for him to travel with me. In the meanwhile, I will talkmore with the client about what the ghosts have uncovered, will ask some morequestions for clarification, will arrange the client so that he may more easily accessthe flow of Waters. The latter may involve positioning the client, massage to shiftthe Flow of Waters, etc. Again, the actions are always subtle and smooth. I alwayskeep in mind that I’ve a job to do other than show a client how ‘cool’ and eccentricI am.Notice that there is no Magic Circle. New Agers don’t like this. I usually circlethe client and myself with a rope, but this is not for safety or show; it is just a toolfor tying more closely together during our short relationship. I don’t call guardianspirits or draw a circle of protection. I work, I guess, without a safety net. I workin the real world where we live, work, and play. I am not in the business of eithercontrolling demons or putting up a show of ceremony; I am working on a client.Magic Circles are for die-hard Wiccans and ceremonial magicians. I am a seiðman;"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman229I already exist between the worlds–I bridge the two. I need ready access to both.On most occasions, however, I will ‘call witnesses’ to the curing session. These arenot guardians or anything of the sort. They are simply witnesses. They are notsymbolic nor do they represent magical directions or anything of the like. They arethere only to witness the curing. This is the way I was trained and is the way Iwork.I leave at some point and travel with a team of ghosts. Usually, we are trackingdown specific problems or are hunting for certain tools to achieve our ends. Some-times we must track down the real doctor who will design a medicine for the cure.Sometimes we go out into the world to find the original event to make some changesin it so that there is a new set of effects. These new effects may be necessary so thata cure can take place. Sometimes we must temporarily repair transgressions com-mitted by the client often by making certain sacrifices. Sometimes others (maliciousenemies or often unknowing friends) have left ‘hooks’ in the client which serve todrain away luck—these must be detached and occasionally payment is due before adetachment can be made. In the case of an InDweller, we must often seek out histrue home and try to uncover its reason for taking up residence in the client. Dealsmust be made in a case like this because InDwellers are not often willing to give uptheir new home. Such work can take anywhere form one to three hours in Midgardtime–days or weeks in Otherworld time.Upon return, I will often take a short break, and will often present the scope ofthe problem and cure with the client. If medicines must be prepared, I will mix theplants/ ghosts and make the client take the medicine before leaving off the session.If actions must be taken by the client, these will be prescribed and dicussed at thistime.After the short hiatus, I will go into the client with the team of ghosts to makeany immediate repairs. These will generally result in some immediate but usuallytemporary relief. Often the client has not had an efficient flow for some time. Theclients usually enjoy this part and often think that this is when the cure takes place.In reality, the cure takes placewhen the proper action on the part of the client hastaken place—this is when the patient acknowledges the cure which may be 2 weeksto 2 years down the line.8.8. On the Making of a Seiðman–A Final Word (or Two):I am not sure that I would ever opt for becoming a seiðman. The constantvigilance, although it gets easier as time goes on, is cumbersome for the individualas well as his family (if he still has one). Looking back over my life, I am not surethat things could have gone differently, though."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. The Making of a Seiðman230I acknowledge that there are three types of seiðmen.1. The first would be hereditary. I have never heard of one nor seen one. I’ve heardsome folk say that have hereditary access to either heathenry or seiðmaking, butI don’t ever believe it. In saga times this may have been a reality, but in moderntimes, these are always individuals who have a need to impress. They would bebest served by learning to accept theirrealstarting points in life rather thanliving a fantasy, but there need to avoid reality is often very strong and I’verarely seen one change his tune in less than a 20 year time frame.2. The second is thestudent. These can work out if the training addresses the factthat they usually have a need to seek for approval. Often these feel as if they area hapless person in a semi-viscious world. Sometimes they may be best served byhelping them to repair their damaged selves. Once the repair is made, they oftenforget about the serious need to study seið that they once had. Occasionally,they continue on with their studies and do well with one foot in each world.3. The third is like me, a luck squandering jerk, who is spared from death byhaving denizens of the Otherworld place one foot back in the world of the living.Training is always in the hands of ghosts. Usually, they have suffered from alife threatening illness (the result of a lifetime of senseless spending of luck),madness, or perhaps clinical death and have recovered. The will eventuallybecome Wholemakers not out of some need for approval or to impress, but outof a need to do so to live. Seiðmaking for these is not a show but a way of life.Of course, these are ofmy clanso they are my favorites.I am not sure that those who regard themselves as Asatru will agree with everythingin this little book. That was never my intent. I wished only to lay down those thingsthat I have learned at the hands of my teachers. They have taught me much, andfor that I must express my gratitude. They have opened my eyes to a lifetime ofmistakes that I committed over the years both in my interpretation of the lore butalso in my life. Having spent all luck under my own steam, I do not regret in theleast the fact that I am hapless. Standing with one foot in each I have seen morein a decade than most see in a lifetime. When my time is over, and my course hereis run, I know that I have ever more folks to see, homes to be welcomed back into,and more medicines to make.Take care, gentle reader.

The neo-pagan world has heard of the Ásatrú for easily two decadeswith all the comings and goings, the arguments, the accusations of Nazism, satanicconnections, and what often appears to be petty infighting and backbiting, butÁsatrú Folk is a new word. A new word for a new concept.The reconstructed religion of Ásatrú got its start in the early 1970’s by SteveMcNallen and was originally called the Ásatrú Free Assembly and since that timehas undergone several different incarnations, variously as the Ring of Troth, theÁsatrú Alliance and a variety of less well known variations. Always the theme andrationale were the same: this organization is to preserve and protect the practiceof the religion of the ancient northern Germanic peoples. In some organizationsliterary and archeological research was stressed, and in others, the practical side.In any case, protection of the religion from outside and foreign influence is usuallymaintained by the organizations through their writings which is often negativelydirected at those groups perceived to be the most harmful to tradition, i.e., Chris-tianity and neo-paganism: Christianity because it had almost completely replacedthe northern Germanic heathen religion, and neo-paganism because of its willingnessto mix religions.All current and past organizations also have several other things in common withone another:1. All have an established hierarchy;2. All recognize leaders both at the local level and at the national or internationallevel;3. All borrow heavily from the neo-pagan community (whether they admit it ornot);4. All have some internal form of top-down political structure with a primary leadersuch as Allherjarsgoði (named after the leader of the reigning Icelandic organi-zation) or steersman.All these organizations borrow their internal structuring from different sources such"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Appendix A. The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto236as the Catholic Church, favorite political systems, and modern neo-paganism andwhile this is workable in some ways, it does, at times, become a source of contentionand contest with individuals vying for the largest collection of the most prestigioustitles, and, as a consequence, infighting, group-split-offs, and rumor-spreading havebecome the most popular form of Viking Games with spirituality and religious prac-tice often falling far behind in 2nd place.On a personal level, the general attitude of folks belonging to these organiza-tions varies greatly. The individual is encouraged to maintain allegiance to theorganization’s political or religious ideologies, and if the organization’s ideology isto maintain the “purity” of the religion against all foreign influence, individuals may(and often do) find themselves seriously at odds with their geographical communities(the communities they physically live in) and may feel threatened enough to engagein acts which are clearly against common modern social mores. Because of this issueand the several mentioned above a new movement of those who hold their heritagedear and of those individuals sympathetic to such a cause is launched.The Ásatrú Folk, the People of the Æsir and Vanir (the two tribes of the northernGermanic Gods), are a collective of like-minded individuals who accept that thespirituality of the ancient Germanic heathen leads to a complete, and fulfilling life.We utilize this spirituality to gauge and to take responsibility for all our actionsso that the greatest numbers of our families and communities benefit. Having noleaders and disregarding politico-religious or economically based hierarchies, we arenot at odds with anyone. We recognize that the differences between people are asimportant as the similarities and that these differences whether of opinion, belief,faith, life-style, or physical differences are worthy of celebration.We are best described as aMovementwho look to the northern Germanic pan-theon of Gods, demi-gods, and ancestors (heroes or otherwise) as a source for spir-itual fulfillment, and who work towards the acceptance of this spirituality withinthe geographical communities by participating in that community rather than byengaging in negative or punitive action. We recognize that no individual, group ofindividuals, or organization has the authority to stand between man and his personalreligion, and we demonstrate this through our actions. We exist only to celebratethe religion of the ancient Germanic peoples and to serve as guides to those whowish to follow this spiritual path.We, the Ásatrú Folk, accept and hold sacred the following:1. We hold the Gods and demi-gods of the ancient Germanic peoples, and personalancestry holy while at the same time maintaining that all other religions, andthe right to practice those religions, is worthy of respect.Commentary:All individuals have the right under the American Bill of Rights tothe freedom of religion.

The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto237to practice their own religions as they see fit according to their traditions is toengage in a personal battle of a political nature and to demonstrate disregardfor the well-being and integrity of family as well as community. This movementholds no opinion in this regard with the exception that our role in maintainingthe well-being and integrity of family and community is clearly related personalresponsibility and respect of this Midgard.Personal responsibility to both family an community takes into regard that socialcustoms and social mores of a community may vary. At times, differences mayoccur between a family and a community which may require negotiation to bringthe differences into harmony; however, the well-being and integrity of family andcommunity are held in highest regard as opposed to personal ambitions.2. We define our spirituality as being that which allows the individual to mostcomfortably interact with the inhabitants of Yggdrasil; our most holy duty is tothe integrity of the household and its members, and their role in maintaining thewell-being of the geographical community, on out to the regional, then nationallevels.Commentary:While the rights of the individual are highly valued, and properrespect is paid to both community and government, it is the family which must bekept, protected, and molded for proper function within the larger whole. Personalresponsibility for action (in this case, for bringing the family together, mainte-nance of the individual’s role within the family, and maintenance of the family’srole within the community) is regarded as the greatest of virtues as expressed inboth eddaic and sagaic literature.We adhere to the idea that personal responsibility is to ourselves first, but that thepurpose behind personal responsibility is always to play a role in the maintenanceof the well-being of all inhabitants of Yggdrasil, beginning with the individual andmoving outwards in ever widening circles to eventually encompass the whole. Werecognize that our effectiveness is always greatest at the local level.3. We recognize ‘the household’ as being the only central organization for our pur-pose. ’Household’ is defined here as the household members (all beings residingwithin the household unit), the physical living quarters of the group living to-gether as a unit, the lands upon which the household resides, and the rules ofconduct to which the members of the household adhere.Commentary:The household is the only recognizable organization by the ÁsatrúFolk. There are many organizations around the world proclaiming to have trueunderstanding of Ásatrú and how it should be practiced, and while many of theselay claim to respectable research in the area of Germanic Studies (and thereforeare worthy of respect for the work they have done), they are not regarded as anauthority over any household of Ásatrú Folk. The household is regarded as the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Appendix A. The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto238center of its own realm, completely sovereign and independent of any organiza-tion. Crossing into the householdings of another automatically means that therules of conduct of that household supersede all others. If an individual cannot,for some reason, abide by the rules of conduct in the household of another, he isobligated to leave.The exception to the above is that household members visiting another householdas a group are expected to adhere to the rules of conduct of theirown, householdas well as those of the host (usually enforced by an elder) as in the case of onefamily visiting another. If the rules of the 2 households conflict, the visitingfamily is obligated to leave. Guests causing strife in a host’s household is to beavoided.&nbsp;4. We recognize that each human being is either the head or a member of a house-hold and as a representative of a household is worthy of respect.Commentary:We accept that each individual human being regardless of his orher background, religious or political affiliation, or personal philosophy/ practicesretains the right to run or participate in a household of his or her choosing andregardless of whether we agree with their personal/ household philosophy. Themember of any one household may set guidelines, rules, etc. for the household ofwhich he or she is a member and is respected in that right, but no one householdholds dominion over another.5. The Frið-yard is considered either a temporary or permanent household. If theFrið-yard is on the property of an Ásatrú household, the rules of conduct of thehost’s household apply; if the Frið-yard is on public lands or lands obtained forthe purpose of celebration, the guests may either determine the rules of conductamong themselves or the procurer of the temporary site may set the rules ofconduct prior. In either case, the temporary rules of conduct are added to anyexisting rules, laws or regulations which are part and parcel to the land itselfand do not supersede them.Commentary:Ásatrú Folk enjoy ‘moots’ as they are called in common Ásatrúparlance and will join them up to several times per year. There must be commonagreements to the rules of conduct which may be set by the hosting household (asis often the case even if it is on public lands) or by a committee of elders priorto the date of the feast. All members must agree on the terms of conductandon the set fines for infractions. Banishment (outlawry) is the commonest finealthough monetary fines may also be imposed. In any case, the rules of conductmust be known to all partakers prior to or at the beginning of the event.In the case of events occurring on public lands, rules, regulations, and laws re-garding the use of alcohol, drugs, nudity, minor participants, and fires (or anyother area of concern) must be taken into account."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Appendix A. The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto2396. Each individual member is responsible for learning and practicing the heathenreligion of the Germanic peoples in a fashion consistent with tradition as it hasbeen passed on to us through the sagaic and eddaic literature of the ancientnorthern Europeans, and through the traditions of folklore as it relates to thisheathen religion.Commentary:Respect is paid to the heritage of the heathen Germanic peoplesthrough maintaining a personal religious practice unadulterated by obvious foreigninfluence although it is recognized that some practices bear resemblance to prac-tices from other religions. Although respect may be paid to other, non-Germanic,spiritual presences, especially as they relate to geographical locations, non-ÁsatrúFolk familial lineages, and other religions, it is expected that such respect will paidas a representative of the Ásatrú Folk.7. No individual, household, or committee speaks with an authoritative voice forhouseholds of Ásatrú Folk.Commentary:There are recognized authorities among Ásatrú Folk but these arealways in various areas of research. Since the Ásatrú Folk as a whole do notrecognize any authorities over their individual households, there are no speakersfor us except at the level of the household. No group, individual or committee maymake a pretense of speaking for any household of Ásatrú Folk; each household issovereign.On the other hand, there are elders among the Ásatrú Folk who are deserving ofhigh respect by virtue of merit, deeds performed, or by their generosity. Respect,among us, cannot be demanded by title or rank since none are recognized; it mustbe given by individuals on a personal level only. In other words, respected eldersareonlyrespected elders because individuals offer them respectnotbecause theywere voted into an office or had elected themselves.8. Our membership is free to all who wish to accept the traditions of the ÁsatrúFolk without reservation provided they have no other religious affiliation; werecognize that no organization stands between an individual and his concept ofthe religion of the ancient Germanic peoples.Commentary:Anyone wishing to call him or herself a member of the ÁsatrúFolk may do so without fees, registration of name, and without contact from anyother member of this religious movement. Since the movement polices its ownmaintenance of tradition by following above points of tradition, no one need fearreprisal from any other. Anyone who wishes to deviate from the above pointssimply allows himself to be considered a non-member.9.

Gatherings for any other purpose are not recognized as part ofthis movement.Problems with political, financial, or authority issues serve only to redirect folksaway from their spiritual course, and since the tradition of the Ásatrú Folk isa spiritual practice and a religion only, it holds no interest in any other arena.Any one desiring to publish newsletters or books, to speak publicly regarding hisor her spiritual practices, or in any way disseminate knowledge or informationabout the Way of the Ásatrú Folk is free to do so providing that all informationpresented is given only as personal opinion. No individual can speak for theÁsatrú Folk.Every individual and every group of individuals calling itself Ásatrú Folk is re-sponsible only to the maintenance of the religious practice of the ancient Ger-manic heathens.A.1.GENERALCOMMENTARYThe concept behind the Movement is more foreign to modern tastes than whatis usually presented as a set ofby-laws. Its action of governing is byinclusionratherthanexclusion.We moderns are much more used to the “Thou shalt nots . . . .” Wegenerally govern by excluding those we don’t like and whoever is left over we keep.While such laws may be good for a nation (although this may be questionable), suchalso do not promote personal responsibility nor are they in keeping with a spiritualway of life.The ancient Teutons in many communities allowed thecommunityto decidewho was or was not suitable to live there. If a crime was committed by an individ-ual against a community, the community expected that the individual would makethings right again. If a man committed murder, wergild to the worth of the deadperson was expected, and the value was set by the community. Refusal to pay was apersonal decision, and the community’s response was that the man was no longer aperson who wished to remain a part of that community. He was free to go but wasno longer protected by the community. His value to that community was set at zeroand whether he lived or died was of no consequence. The ultimate choice was left inthe hands of the individual who was expected to be completely responsible for hisdecisions. To set up a movement according to this ancient tradition is not difficult.It is, however, very uncomfortable-feeling to moderns, who have grown accustomedto allowing organizations above them rule their behaviors. In the latter half of the20th century, we cheat on our taxes, we lie about other people, we drive illegally"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Appendix A. The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto241(by breaking laws such as running stop signs, invalid plates, no brake-lights, intoxi-cated, etc.) as long as we don’t get caught by theauthorities.This Movement hasno authorities to get caught by. We are expected either to buy into the Movementorwe don’t belong to it.The question will arise: “How do we protect ourselves?” The answer is simple:We don’t. We don’t have to. We define ourselves by what we are and what we do.If we wish to follow points #2 - #9, but we cannot accept Point #1, we are notÁsatrú Folk.Much of our culture is defined by inconsistent behavior. “Today I don’t feel likeliving in a spiritual manner; I’ll do it tomorrow.” The question which needs to bereviewed by any prospective member of this Movement must be: “Can I afford tolead my life according to the Way of the Ásatrú Folk all the time?” If the answeris “Well, maybe” then one is simply not part of this Movement. If one can act in amanner consistent with Points #1 - #9, then one is a part of the Movement; if not,then one is something else. We have defined ourselves. If one fits the definition,then oneis.We are not accustomed to living our lives within an organization that isselfpolicing.We rather expect that some authority figure is skulking out there who cancatch us, and we lead our lives to stay somewhat out-of-sight of the law. We arenot used to watching our own behavior rather than someone else’s. However, thisMovement demands self-honesty ratherhonesty-for-the-cops.Paying attention toour own behavior rather than someone else’s is uncomfortable for us; we are oftenbetter trained to gossip than to engage in self-examination, and, additionally, weoften seek to gain from others rather than trying to figure out ways toadd to thatwhich others are doing.Egotism (masquerading as the “fierce individuality” of modern Ásatrú) reallydoesn’t play much of a role either here or in historical heathen communities. It isand was recognized that each individual has important skills, but that those skillsare only important within the context of a community. A carpenter may be verygood, but without a house to build, he is not a carpenter. A thread by itself is oflittle value; so it is with the “fierce individual.”“What is to keep anothergroupfrom coming in and taking over?” Nothing.We have nothing to protect. We define ourselves by what we are and what we do.Another philosophy cannotmove in and take the name Ásatrú Folkbecause it isnota name; it is a definition. One is either Ásatrú Folk, or one is not, but the nameneeds no protection. A follower of the Way of the Ásatrú Folk can only be recognizedbyactionnot by whether he or she has paid the annual dues. A follower’s actions aredefined in Points #1 - #9. Someone who belongs to a hate-group or another religionfalls outside the definition. Someone who incorporates New Age with the Northern"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Appendix A. The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto242Way falls outside the definition. Someone who mistreats his or her family, or placesthemselves above or outside the geographical community through acting outside thecommunity’s accepted code of conduct and makes no attempt at reconciliation fallsoutside the definition. Someone who attempts by force or coercion to judge anotherby his or her own personal ethics is extending his or her own personal laws beyondthe borders of the household, and, therefore, falls outside the definition. We areself-defining, and, therefore, self-policing.The Movement defines only parameters within which a person acts. If necessarythat something within a community needs modification, we are fully within ourrights to bring that to the community’s attention. If cars, for example, are speedingin a designated school zone, and that clearly represents a threat to the childrenin the area, we are right to act according to the standards of the community bypresenting the problem to the community. We are not within our right to thrownails into the roadway or shoot at the cars. If a hate-group springs up in town, weare within our rights as followers to1. voice our opinion of thephilosophy(notof the individuals),2. exclude them (as followers of that philosophy) from any invitations into ourhousehold,3. exclude ourselves from community activities which support such philosophies, or4. leave the community, if it tends to support such a philosophy, in search of an-other.We are not to take offense, however, against that community. We are allowed todefend ourselves within the acceptable code of conduct of that community. Muchtoo often theM-16-from-the rooftop of the-nearest-McDonald’s mentalityreigns. Sowhat happens if one of the followers breaks such a rule? By definition, he or shefalls outside the definition of the Movement. Such a one is not Ásatrú Folk.Governing by definition is not something that will be easy for a lot of folks.These folks feel the need for policing. That is fine. There are plenty of groupsand organizations out there to do that, but, by definition we take responsibilityfor our own actions, and we know that our power ends at the thresholds of ourhomes. We do not (no can we, by definition) engage in unilateral decisions forour communities; we do not govern their behavior. Our measure of worth is valueto others and is not determined by us; we are valued by others as companions,good guests, good researchers, good hosts, good carpenters. We realize that thereis no point in standing up anddemandingthat we be recognized. We are eitherrecognized or not. One of the kennings for a king wasgold-hater.Good leadershipis a by-product of how much one can give not by how loudly someone yells.Governing by definition is remarkable in that we do not need to judge individualsbut only their words and actions.

The Ásatrú-Folk Manifesto243hate either in word or action against ethnic groups or people with particular sexualpreferences, he or she falls outside the definition, and, therefore, is not a followeras demonstrated by behavior. In such a case, none of us need to judge anyone; weneed only maintain the definition. We see the demonstration of behavior as fallingoutside the definition, and, by that, know that the individual by having engagedin the act is not Ásatrú Folk. If a particular household chooses not toinviteanindividual perhaps secretly because of color, ethnicity, or whatever, neither actionnor word has been placed against anyone. In this case, however, the individual mayneed to question his or her own motives for belonging to the Movement. This, afterall, is a spiritual quest not a contest for the most money, fame or power.The Points as outlined in the Manifesto present themselves as a Code of Behaviorwhich manifests as a Movement. A follower of the Movement is one who manages hisor her life according to the entire constellation of Points. No voting on membershipis necessary; membership defines itself. Personal feelings are left behind, and respon-sibility for one’s behavior is entirely in the hands of the individual. Recognition byother members of the Movement is by how much is given, not by names, titles, orother forms of transient power. As a consequence, there can be nostriving to reachthe top, orblackballing. The Points demand that a follower police his or her ownbehavior, take personal responsibility for his or her own life, winnings and failures,and participate in a spiritual way of life where the only recognition is by how muchone is valued by others.The EndHave a Happy LifeandBe Whole!The SeiðmanBil"}]
