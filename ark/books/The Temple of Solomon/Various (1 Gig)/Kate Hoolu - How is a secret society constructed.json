Kate HooluThis is half tongue-in-cheek; a sociology checklist based on a magical order,rather than society at large. Please note, it is based on no real-life Occult TrainingOrganisations in the magical field. Because they tend to sue...So, how is a secret society constructed? From a variety of smaller units; variousgroups joined by some common bond or bonds such as a jointly held secret (or,as some would have it, a cosmic joke that you are let in on, but only by degrees).Whatever the nature of the smaller units they are all comprised of the basebuilding block of society: INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS.How does a secret society operate or function? The cynical answer is that itdoesn't. Suspending belief a little allows me to say that a secret society functionsas a result of co-operative (or at least not openly obstructive) inter-actionsbetween different groups and/or individuals. Of course...Why are some groups in a secret society more powerful than others? Using themetaphor of a wolf pack; there will always be alpha males who are strong enough,with the necessary will and intelligence to assume (or fight for) leadership. In thecase of wolves it is the best for the pack that the leader is the strongest etc, as itis primarily his genes that go towards future generations to ensure the strongestpups and thus the continuation of the pack. Not necessarily so for humans; aspower in a secret society is also reliant on capital, who has their hands on themagic books and tools, and the Orders and Charters to run the group (which areall usually hierarchically, rather than genetically inherited), the ability tomanipulate the public face of the order, and to be in charge of deciding who getsinitiated, and when- both of which abilities are learned. Alternative answers maybe that for whatever reasons certain family of other closely knit groups havehistorical precedent for positions of leadership, such as having an individual whowas initiated by ‘X’; a previous great leader...these become pseudo-hereditarypositions in the absence of revolutionary change.What causes social change in a secret society? A desire from either the rulingelement(s) of society or those ruled for a change to occur. If the rulers have truecontrol, or the ruled have sufficient collective will then change will come about.Slow, peaceful change is evolutionary; sudden, violent change is revolutionary.Legal battles over copyright of rituals, libel, slander, magical battles and fistfightsin the street are all possible.Is a secret society normally in balance or in conflict? Look at history. Neither. Thebest metaphor here is from chemistry...with two chemicals in a state ofequilibrium, the state is balanced, but in a dynamic fashion: all molecules are instates of change, but the rate of change is, on average, balanced out by oppositechanges in molecules elsewhere. Of course, not all metaphors are equal, andmagical group membership is rarely this cutesy.What is the relationship of the individual to a secret society? The individual is notdependent on society for Hir existence. The secret society is entirely dependentupon the individual; as it has no existence of its own, only through people, andthe supposed heritage it holds. A secret society is an amalgam of the qualities,actions and thoughts of individuals, both past and present members, and as suchit can become rather dehumanising. Due to the collective nature; society seems\"bigger\" than the individual, i.e. more powerful. A summary of the relationshipwould be one of tacit suspicion, but occasional periods of general tolerance.What is the primary purpose of sociological study of a secret society? To keepsociologists in jobs. Also to investigate and understand the many different aspectsof behaviour of people; hopefully in a manner that allows the use of reliableinformation to make life something more than it is (subjective!). To understandwhat occultism is about for the participant. And to make a study in a way thatavoids law enforcement agencies finding severed tongues on beaches and bodieshung by the neck from bridges, with pockets full of rocks, where the rising tidecan cover their bodies.

Conversely John Stuart Millcouldn’t have run a knitting circle, let alone a magickal group: \"the individual isnot accountable to society for his actions in so far as these concern the interestsof no person but himself. Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by otherpeople if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures bywhich society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct.\"One example of how a group is formed would be the very early days of ourmodern Political system, where over time a group of individuals gathered togetherwith a common purpose, chose a leader who then attended a centralisedgathering of the leaders of other groups for a large region or entire nation. Thissystem is just recognisable as that which we currently have in the UK, with localpolitical party groups choosing a prospective MP, who, if elected goes to theCommons to represent their locality. The parliamentary system is thus basedinitially on the actions of individuals; and in turn it can then control the lives ofthose same people. Like a magical order... Analogies with Frankenstein's monsterhave been drawn; and it is a valid point that the creation has often become biggerthan the creator(s). I don’t know of a truly egalitarian Marxist magickal orderanywhere- maybe someone out there can enlighten me? Stick it in the forum *link please.One of Durkheim's main premises is that society remains cohesive due to theconsensus will of the majority. That is, the members of a secret society hold andexhibit a set of values (traditional, religious, moral etc) that are agreed to benormal and acceptable behaviour; and that this allows the secret society to runsmoothly. There are individuals or small groups who are exceptions to this rule ofcourse; but in the main, the secret society continues from day to day much as italways has, with major change only ocurring slowly over generations. Withconsensus comes the vision that as a secret society is so large, powerful and(perceptibly from day-to-day) unchanging it is then that secret society thatshapes individuals. This is not a new perspective, over 2000 years beforeDurkheim, Aristotle had come to similar conclusions about the need for groups:\"All communities are like parts of the political community..political associations,too, are believed to have been originally formed and to continue in being for thesake of advantage, for it is this that lawgivers have as their object, and people saythat what is to the common advantage is just\" The main implications are that a secret society is a very static \"thing\" havingsome separation from individuals; hence there is little chance of anyone to makean impact on the society...at worst it is a science of inaction and reducedexpectations. As with any societal theory, a great deal depends upon the operatorwho first puts it into effect; perhaps the Russian people were just unlucky inhaving Stalin to try out Marxism in the same way that the Golden Dawn had bothMathers and Yeats in competition, when along came Crowley. In a way there arecorollaries with the maiden voyage of the Titanic; a seemingly unsinkable ship anda couple of seemingly wonderful means of liberation for the majority of mankind.Similar results in all cases. Come to think of it, that wasn’t so damn tongue in cheek....KHAbout the authorComment in the forumArticles of 500-1000 words or so from any contributor on suitable topicsare always welcome.
