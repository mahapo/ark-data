For one thing, I’m used to giving courses,not taking them, so it was kind of strange to be sitting in the audience, ratherthan standing in front of a podium. Much worse was the fact that the courseinstructor turned out to have very bad teaching skills, and a less-than-firmgrasp of his subject matter. Finding yourself thousands of miles from home,forced to listen to a rank amateur for hours on end, can become unbearable.“Now if you please, divide yourselves up into groups of two, one in-structor and one pupil per group. Pupils please stretch out on your back andconcentrate on alpha...” By ‘alpha’ he meant a special kind of relaxation tech-nique he’d taught us earlier. “Each instructor will choose a subject at randomfrom the pile of files on the table over in the corner. Pupils will then attemptto form a mental image of the subject and diagnose his or her health problem.Instructors should take notes and encourage their pupils, without providingany information, of course.” Diagnosing the health problem of a person you’ve never met seemedlike a ludicrous idea to me. On the other hand, although highly skeptical, Iwas thrilled to actually be doing something at last. I turned to Sylvie, anacquaintance of mine, who also happened to be taking the course."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 7“Want to be my partner?” I said.“Sure. Who goes first?”“I think your highly developed sense of feminine intuition makes you anatural candidate for the pupil role. What do you think?”“Okay,” she said. “You go and pick out a file.”People were busy pairing off, making space for themselves in the large,luxurious conference room of the hotel we were staying at, a Hilton. I was thefirst to pick up a case file, a single typewritten sheet with the name, age andaddress of a person neither of us knew, and a description of the health prob-lem we were supposed to diagnose.Sylvie stretched out on the thick carpet.“Now breathe deeply and relax,” I said. She closed her eyes and sloweddown her respiration. “Get in touch with your alpha energy. Tell me whenyou’re ready.”She was so still she already seemed far away.“Ready... “ she said.“I’m going to count to three. On the count of three, you are going to forma mental picture of Mr. Mario Mantella, 55 years old, from Naples, Italy. Youwill perform a careful and complete examination, and tell me what you find.”I waited, curious to hear what she’d say, convinced she’d be making it allup. Suddenly her breathing speeded up and her eyeballs started flutteringbeneath closed lids. “No... no...” she gasped, shivering and breathing evenfaster. It was when her body began writhing in pain that I started to panic.Parapsychology and opposition to change"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 8My first contact with the paranormal goes back to 1962, the year a bookcalled The Morning of the Magicians became a best-seller. I found the book’sblend of fiction and reality a little hard to swallow, but I had to admit that itscollection of data, most of which seemed to support the hypothesis that para-normal phenomena do, in fact, exist, was disconcerting. I felt relieved when agroup calling themselves the Rational Union published a refutation entitledThe Evening of the Magicians, which exposed the inconsistencies and weak-nesses of the original work. Once again the bright sun of Logic rose in the skyof Reason, encompassing all, leaving no corner of darkness.I was reassured – everything could be explained, and what logic couldnot account for simply did not exist.This extremely comfortable intellectual position resulted in my rejectinganything that was really new – and therefore incomprehensible. Understand-ing means ‘standing under’ – adding a piece to the edifice of our knowledge.If the piece is too new, if it does not quite fit in with all the other pieces, it ispromptly rejected.This kind of fear of anything new can sometimes assume a violent char-acter. There are many instances of great thinkers and men of science takingrefuge in madness in order to avoid being persecuted for their ideas: Wells,the inventor of modern anesthesia; Cantor, a mathematician who discoveredtransfinite or ordinal numbers; Semmelweis who discovered the antisepticproperties of chloride of lime, to name just a few. Others, like Galileo, Pasteurand Einstein, put up a fight.A publicity campaign launched by IBM in 1972 demonstrates how thescientific community tends to react to new discoveries:“G. Stephenson’s locomotive is a fearful monstrosity, a clear example ofcriminal madness. We hereby demand that its use be prohibited.” (Proclama-tion issued by the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1829)."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 9“We must use all our influence to put a stop to the criminal research onblood transfusions. Injecting someone else’s blood into a patient’s veins causesalmost immediate death, or at the very least, insanity.” (Published in a jour-nal of medicine and surgery in 1925).“It is true that Mr. Charles Lindbergh’s recent accomplishment deservesrecognition. We hope, however, that aviation companies will never be so fool-ish as to place the lives of their personnel, not to mention passengers, at risk,by attempting to transport them over long distances in machines that are asuncomfortable and unsafe as Mr. Lindbergh’s airplane.” (Report issued by ascientific organization in 1927).The list goes on. Similar objections are being raised today, and will con-tinue to be raised in the future. Research into the paranormal, and parapsy-chology in particular, has become a favorite target of this kind of prejudice.This is not surprising when you consider that various religious groups gen-erally offer so-called miracles as proof of the existence of God. Science, whichhas been persecuted by powerful religions throughout history, is now in aposition of authority, and seems intent on exacting its own form of intellec-tual revenge, rejecting legitimate paranormal research along with more ques-tionable mystical practices and beliefs.After all, if we are to admit that such phenomena exist, we must haveproof. Like Saint Thomas, we want to touch and feel whatever it is we areinvestigating. Even better, we want to live the experience for ourselves.She has known him for a long time...Five or six curious people have gathered in a group around us. Sylvie’sbreathing has returned to normal, after the course instructor held her handand told her to “Relax... calm down and relax...” in a deep, penetrating voice.I resume the exercise, not without some apprehension. “Tell me whatyou see.”“I can’t ... yes, now I see him. God, he’s suffering so much...”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 10“What does he look like?”“He’s tall, slim. A haughty expression, something aristocratic about hisface, a kind of authority. His hair is completely white. He’s lying on an metal-framed bed.”“That’s good, that’s very good.” (We were told to encourage each otheras much as possible.) “Can you tell me what his problem is?”“His back, I see his back. He can’t move. He’s in pain, the poor man. Ithink he’s paralyzed. It’s his spine... he had an accident, horseback riding.”I am both astonished and perplexed. On the sheet of paper in front of me,written in black and white, are the words ‘spinal paralysis.’ Other details likethe white hair and the riding accident may have been the fruit of her imagi-nation, but the diagnosis... I’m certain there is no way she could have seen orheard it. Had some kind of telepathic link been established between Sylvieand the patient?“All right, you can now come out of your alpha state. Remember, whenyou open your eyes your head and neck will feel completely relaxed, you’llfeel alert, full of energy and in complete harmony.”I can feel her body reanimating. She shudders slightly, and after whatseems like a very long time, finally opens her eyes.“So, did you find out what his problem was?” she asks.“Exactly as you described it,” I reply.She couldn’t believe it at first, but she soon became enthusiastic. Her eyesburned with excitement. “You know I couldn’t move at all!”“You were almost shouting in pain. You gave me quite a scare.”We looked for the person who had given us the case history."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 11“He’s my uncle,” she said, “a former cavalry officer.”I felt like I was living a dream, or rather a nightmare, something out ofEdgar Allan Poe. She showed me a picture of a tall man with white hair anda serious face, everything that Sylvie had described, right down to the lastdetail. There was one thing, however, that didn’t fit.“You say he can walk, that he wears a kind of brace?”“That’s right, but not for the time being. He’s had a relapse. I got a letterfrom him yesterday. He’s been bedridden for a couple of weeks now.”Sylvie interrupts her, adding details, all too eager to express what shesaw. It’s almost as if she’d known the man for a very long time, as if she andthe other woman were old friends, talking about one of their old school pro-fessors.“Well, I guess it’s your turn,” Sylvie says. After what she’s just gonethrough I feel somewhat hesitant.“No, really, it’s not worth the trouble,” I reply, hoping she’ll let me off thehook. But she won’t.“Come on, I don’t want you to miss out on the experience,” she says,heading for the desk to pick up another case history.“Find something easy for me!”I don’t feel very comfortable. My emotions seem to vacillate betweendesire and fear, like a first love affair. I stretch out on the carpet, do somedeep breathing to relax. I hear Sylvie’s voice. It sounds far away, as if it isbeing muffled by fog.“Martine Lebel, thirty-three years old, lives in Paris. One... two... three.Now you can see her, Martine Lebel, thirty-three, living in Paris...”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 12“I don’t see anything.”“Look harder.”Images run through my mind like a kaleidoscope. Suddenly I see a targetmade of concentric circles. In the center of the target the silhouette of a per-son appears. The person seems to have two bullet wounds, both of whichemit a kind of red glow.“I can’t,” I hear myself say.“What do you see?”I describe the image.“Where are the bullet holes?”“There’s one right in the middle of the stomach... here.” I cover the spotwith my hand. “The other one’s just above the mouth.”“Very good. Try to see more details.”I’m pleased when she says ‘very good.’ It encourages me to try harder.Tissues and organs appear, as if an operation were being performed. Theypulsate rhythmically as blood pumps through them. A horrible ball of fleshdetaches itself, all red and bloated.“That’s excellent,” Sylvie says. “Now concentrate on her face.”I see a black thread running from her upper lip to her skull ...Consider the situation normalI’m certain my diagnosis is all wrong, or at least incomplete. But when Iemerge from my state of deep relaxation, a surprise awaits me: the woman"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 13has a tumor in her intestines that keeps growing back (she’s had seven suc-cessive operations) and a kind of black growth on her upper lip (doctors havebeen unable to diagnose its origin).Eager to learn more, I decide to observe some of the other groups whoare still ‘at work.’ I hear a young man saying, “Black... it’s all black.” Whenquestioned further he says, “All black... I feel cold... I want to come back.”His case concerned a man suffering from generalized cancer.I walk over to another group. A woman in her forties is talking up a storm.Her instructor has already filled at least three pages with hastily written notes.A young woman walks up to me. “I haven’t had my turn yet. Do youthink you could be my instructor?” I agree. I have to admit that there’s some-thing pleasant about watching a pretty young woman relax. It’s as if theirfaces become transfigured. Some become even more beautiful, while othersseem to age considerably. I recall a passage from a book in which a man tellshis friend to ‘... look at her mother’s face before you marry the girl (his youngfiancée).’The session goes very well, almost as if it were routine. Humans have anextraordinary ability to adapt to new situations - I find myself consideringthe exercise completely normal, like taking a walk to the corner store!During a pause we gather in informal groups and discuss our experi-ences. The atmosphere in the room has changed completely. People who werereserved and skeptical at first have become entirely enthusiastic. Those whoinsisted that the whole exercise was ridiculous can’t wait to describe theirincredible visions. They explain, ask questions and listen with the passionateinterest of ‘those in the know.’The blackness and cold expressed by the young man earlier on was en-tirely accurate: the case concerned a woman who had died three months ear-lier (one of the participants had decided to play a sinister kind of joke bysubmitting the case history of a dead person). Results of the case I myself hadsubmitted - it concerned my grandfather - were also accurate: heaviness in"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 14the legs and emphysema, the two problems I had listed, were both diagnosed.The subject even predicted an additional problem - a kidney malfunction -which I knew nothing about, but which I was able to verify later on.That, word for word, is what happened to me on a November day backin 1972. Since then I’ve seen hundreds of people experience the same sense ofamazement. I have passed over to the other side of the barrier, and now all Iwant to do is understand. Perhaps you too would like to understand moreabout what lies beyond the scope of ordinary experience. If so, this book maybe of some help.Developing your paranormal facultiesMy son is five years old, right in the middle of his ‘why’ phase, the pe-riod when children discover life and the world around them. Watching himplay or carry on with his daily activities, I too often wonder why. Why is itthat adults lose their ability to marvel at the world, to seek and understand,to imagine and evolve?Take any one of your friends. Ask him or her to draw a picture. Chancesare the answer you’ll get is, “I don’t know how to draw.”Ask the same thing of a child and the question of ability won’t even arise.For children, drawing is just like breathing - it’s a completely natural func-tion.For us adults, drawing is a gift reserved for a special few. Some peopledraw, some write, some think, some drive a truck. This kind of specializa-tion, the division of tasks into categories, leads to the fragmentation of hu-man beings. We become limited.I sometimes think longingly about someone like Leonardo Da Vinci, notbecause he lived at a time when almost everything was still to be discovered(there are ALWAYS new things to discover) but because he was able to graspthe whole body of knowledge available to mankind at that time."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 15Optics, physics, astronomy, physiology, anatomy, philosophy, geography,mathematics, botany, acoustics, ballistics, hydraulics, architecture, sculpture,painting - none of these disciplines held any secrets for him. He discoveredthe laws of gravitation before Copernicus, the constancy of light emitted bythe stars before Kepler. He demonstrated the laws of acceleration of fallingbodies before Galileo, and developed plans for instruments and machinesthat were built long after he died.Sometimes this truly universal man would leave science behind, close upthe laboratory where many of our modern-day inventions were taking form,set aside the lenses he used to study the stars and pick up a lyre, on which hecomposed songs, or a paint brush with which he painted masterpieces likethe Mona Lisa, Saint John the Baptist and the Sistine Chapel frescos.Today, grasping the totality of human knowledge is no longer possible.We are forced to rely on a number of reference points - facts or assumptionsthat we can rely on when confronted by situations that are strange or com-pletely out of the ordinary.Is it possible that these preconceived notions impede our progress? Wehave already seen how skepticism about parapsychology has slowed downour understanding of its potential applications. Very few people like to ad-mit that they are wrong. Although we sometimes jump to hasty conclusions,and although our preconceived ideas often lack a solid basis in fact, we be-come their most ardent defenders as soon as someone tries to convince usthey may be false. In many cases it isn’t the ideas themselves we are defend-ing, but our own love of self.The same thing applies to negative opinions we hold about ourselves.For a long time I maintained a highly negative self image. Whenever I hadtrouble with my homework, for example, I would immediately conclude that‘... I could never understand, I’d never succeed.’ Of course that would onlymake the work that much more difficult, and I’d often end up in tears, to thealarm of my parents."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 16Interestingly enough, drinking a cup of coffee just before an exam changedall that. It was like a revelation! I had never used any drugs or stimulantsbefore, so the caffeine (or the idea I had formed about what caffeine could do)had an extraordinary effect on my mind: in a few seconds I came up with thesolution to a difficult math problem. I completed the test in a third of the timeallotted to us, and got a brilliant mark and the congratulations of my profes-sor and parents.From that day on, I began searching for natural ways to recreate thatstate of mental alertness that had enabled me to instinctively discover thesolution to the exam problem. I have found quite a few over the years. Whatpeople call creativity, intuition, or extra sensory perception (ESP) are statesthat seem to me to be very closely linked. All are at the opposite end of thespectrum of what we generally label ‘ordinary experience.’As Alexis Carrel wrote in his book Man And The Unknown, ‘In modernsociety, most individuals are occupied with activities that could be catego-rized as practical. This is done out of ignorance, or because people are trickedinto believing they must devote all their time to practical matters. Being weak-minded, they submit to the influences of the environment in which they findthemselves.’Some people, on the other hand, are aware that they are being manipu-lated by big business, politics, culture mongers, and so on.Unfortunately, most of us are so preoccupied with taking care of our day-to-day responsibilities that we rarely have an opportunity to make full use ofour intelligence and / or imagination. We see young executives fresh out ofuniversity, brimming with new and exciting ideas, slowly fade as they areworn down by the rigid demands of the companies they work for. Their natu-ral psychic abilities are soon extinguished by the grinding routine they haveto put up with.Trying to find ways to liberate these latent abilities, or at least those whichseem useful and positive, is what this book is all about. I searched throughlibraries and bookstores for existing material, mostly in vain. Some works"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"IntroductionPage 17contained hints of a possible method. None were written in terms that couldbe easily understood by everyone - the obscure, highly pedagogical languagethat was used tended to lead the reader into an endless series of sterile con-jecture. Most books seemed to be a blend of simplistic ideologies, uselessbeliefs and unsatisfactory explanations of various phenomena. None werebalanced and objective: authors either doubted everything, or believed ev-erything at face value.Instead of becoming discouraged and abandoning my search, I decidedto write the book that I would have liked to find. A book that is not overlycritical of our western way of thinking, a book that serves as a bridge be-tween what is familiar and what appears to be strange and unusual. Thesubject matter would be a description of the methods of personal psychologi-cal and parapsychological development that I have discovered and practicedover the years.As I gained experience teaching one such method - Mental Dynamics - tostudents, I gained insight into how the integration of intuition and other para-normal faculties in our day-to-day lives could provide the balance that ourpersonalities seemed to lack.Constantly suppressing parts of ourselves that cannot logically be ex-plained creates tremendous tension on a subconscious level. The self-criticalattitudes drilled into us by our rationalistic education system can be counter-balanced by an understanding of these special powers, adding a new dimen-sion to our existence.As such, developing our paranormal faculties can largely contribute toabolishing the traditional conditioning we have all been subjected to, con-cerning matters like time, space, language and thought, freeing our mind ofits limitations, doubts and anxieties. In that sense, investigating your ownparanormal abilities represents a great step towards attaining real freedom.The voyage is about to begin. Why not come along and discover whatlies on the other side of the ocean of your being, at the very heart of yourinner self."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Part One: Sophrology"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 19Hypnosis“The human mind is a great worker of miracles.”MontaigneA Voodoo CeremonyIt might have been a nightclub act. About thirty people, the men dressedin black tie and the women in long evening gowns, are enjoying an exoticmeal, their tables arranged around a kind of runway stage. A few youngercouples are there, sipping fruit juice instead of alcoholic beverages. There isnothing unusual about the scene, except the atmosphere - these people donot seem to be at ease. It feels like they are waiting for something to happen.The waitresses are also unusual - unlike their customers they seem too re-laxed, without the least hint of servility in their behavior. They’re more likeyoung black fashion models or dancers, completely unconcerned. The decoris comfortable but very sparse. I must say the whole thing is a little bizarre.The nightclub itself happens to be the only voodoo temple in Europe.Situated in the heart of Paris, a group of Haitians have created a locale fortheir cult, in the guise of a private cabaret.A friend of mine got me an invitation. I was expecting to be brought to akind of church. Instead, there I was in what appeared to be an old, rathershabby nightclub. I was disappointed, to say the least.The ceremony begins. It’s just past ten o’clock. Three drums carved outof tree trunks are placed at one end of the runway. Two drummers get intoposition, then start tapping out a rhythm on the tightly stretched skins."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 20The drum beat gains in intensity. As it turns out, the drummers will con-tinue playing nonstop for six hours! The pretty waitresses, wearing mini-skirts and halter tops, perform a few informal dance steps and sing a kind ofchant. A very beautiful black woman dressed in a purple gown appears. Sheis also singing, but as she walks from table to table, greeting the guests in alanguage I don’t understand, I get the impression she’s offering a kind ofchallenge. She laughs a lot.After a few minutes all the guests are asked to stand up. I hear a fewcomplaints, mostly from the men (we’re here to watch, not perform) but sooneveryone is up and clapping hands and dancing in time to the irresistibledrum beat. We all do our best. A slim swaying woman with red hair closesher eyes and lets herself flow with the rhythm, while her overweight com-panion waves his arms around, looking ridiculous. The priestesses, formerlyour waitresses, circulate, showing people, most of whom are a little stiff, howto move.As we dance we are asked to form a circle and hold hands. I feel a currentof energy passing through me. Next we’re told to lie down on the floor andengage in a weird kind of fight - a bum fight. We have to move backwardsuntil we bump into someone with our bum. Initiates can be distinguishedfrom newcomers by their well-aimed, powerful bum kicks. By this time ev-eryone is hot and sweaty. Shoes, ties and jackets have long since been dis-carded.Suddenly the game comes to an abrupt halt.The beautiful woman in the purple gown - the High Priestess as it turnsout - starts talking to us about voodoo.“The first boatloads of slaves arrived in Haiti around the end of the sev-enteenth century. They came from Dahomey, Nigeria, Angola and Togo. Theyspoke a language called ‘Fon.’ In Fon voodoo means god, spirit or image.Although they brought their own religion with them, they were baptized byforce and had to accept religious instruction by catholic missionaries. Voo-doo gradually became a strange mix of creeds, with crucifixes, incense burn-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 21ers and candles used alongside African drums and possession rituals. Voo-doo is an animistic religion which venerates the spirits - or ‘loa.’ Each loa hasits own magical symbol or fetish, which is used to attract it. During voodooceremonies, spirits take possession of initiates. Each spirit behaves differently,and each is recognized and worshipped with its own particular ritual.”Next, the High Priestess talks about voodoo temples. Temples belong toeveryone. People can visit a temple whenever they want, bring their childrento be looked after, or to be treated for various problems. The High Priestess isalso a sorcerer, able to exorcise bad spirits, cast spells and prescribe remediesmade from medicinal herbs. Many patients seek the help of a sorcerer whenconventional medicine is unable to cure them.“Do you have any questions?” she asks.Her little speech has everyone spellbound. While she talked, one of herhelpers had drawn an extremely complicated pattern on the floor, using pow-dered flour. This was the spirit’s fetish.I ask if knowing about spells and fetishes gives someone paranormal abili-ties.“No,” the priestess replies. “Fetishes are like books. All they can do is callup a spirit. Only sages have special powers, which take years of meditationand initiation to develop.”One o’clock in the morning. The ceremony is in full swing. The initiates,or ‘hounsi’ as they’re called, have donned white robes and are dancing to thedrums. Suddenly one of them starts shaking. Her eyes close as if she is afraidof something. The shaking becomes more and more violent, her whole bodystarts convulsing, as if some invisible force were driving her on. Her breath-ing comes in heaving gasps, her gestures are wild. At one point her bodyseems to launch itself like a cannon ball, and she is literally propelled fromone end of the room to the other. She runs right into me, and as I grab herarms to keep from falling I can feel her muscles hard as steel. Her fists aretightly clenched, and I can see her nails digging into her palms. I wonder ifshe’s going to have a cataleptic fit."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 22She starts swaying from side to side. It seems that at any moment shecould lose her balance and topple over. The High Priestess comes over andwraps the girl’s hair in a green scarf, muttering ritual phrases. The girl swoonsand falls to the floor. Other initiates gather round and carry her into a backroom, the ‘chamber of mysteries’ as it’s called, where she can rest until sherevives.One by one, three more ‘hounsi’ are possessed by spirits. The High Priest-ess offers them each a ritual object, a flag or a baton or a scarf, depending ontheir rank. The whole atmosphere is charged with violence. In the middle ofher convulsions, one hounsi walks up to another, strikes her in the face andrips her white dress.“She’s punishing her,” says a woman standing next to me.I become conscious of an unpleasant odor of sweat and candle smokefilling the room.But the most astonishing scene is yet to come, as the High Priestess her-self is possessed. Because of her rank, only the most powerful of spirits enterher body. Her eyes bulge out of their sockets as she starts to tremble andconvulse. She grabs a razor-sharp sword and performs a frenzied dance thathas many of us fearing for our lives. The blade swishes this way and that,inches from our faces.When she moves farther away from where I’m standing I observe thather movements are not at all random, as they seemed at first glance, but pre-cise and controlled, as if she were being guided by an invisible hand. At onepoint she drops the sword and lifts a drum high over her head. I am told laterthat the huge drum, carved out of a solid tree trunk, weighs over 250 pounds.My skepticism vanishes when I try to lift the thing myself - I simply cannotget it off the ground!I am reminded of the same charged atmosphere that I experienced dur-ing sessions of primal scream therapy, where patients, given the opportunity"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 23to vent suppressed feelings of rage, hate, fear and so on, become very animal-istic - you can almost see the beast lurking under the thin layer of humancivility (the subject was well treated in a film called Dr. Moreau’s Island, wherea gifted surgeon tries to transform animals into people, only to find that hiscreations revert to bestiality as nature inevitably intervenes).In this case, however, the movements of those who are possessed are morerefined and graceful, almost cat-like instead of grotesque.The evening ends over a few glasses of fiery rum. The High Priestess, stillin her trance, answers questions put to her by some of the Haitian partici-pants in the ‘Fon’ language. Although the Priestess is not told what theirproblems are, she is able to offer advice and solutions that correspond ex-actly to their situation.A new term : SophrologySitting in front of the fireplace and staring at the dancing flames... Star-ing at the dividing lines on a highway, illuminated by your headlights as youdrive at night... The steady ticking of a grandfather clock... The bewitchingspell of soothing new-age music... The monotonous voice of a professor in astuffy classroom...These are a few examples of the kinds of stimuli that tend to induce astate of gentle reverie. And it is this kind of special state of consciousness thathas become the object of a new branch of scientific study called sophrology.According to the official definition, sophrology is... ‘the phenomenologi-cal study of all states and levels of consciousness, no matter what physical orpsychological agent is used to induce them.’Cult trances like those in the Voodoo ceremony described above, states ofecstasy attained by shamans, hypnotic trances, meditation, chanting, and soon, all fall into its sphere of observation. The word sophrology comes fromthe Greek ‘sos’ meaning serenity or equilibrium, ‘phren’ meaning brain ormind, and ‘logos’ meaning study or science. Etymologically speaking then,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 24sophrology is the study of various methods designed to induce a serene stateof mind. Using scientific methods of analysis, sophrology attempts to offerexplanations for phenomenon which have long been categorized as mystical,magical or paranormal.ShamansActing as intermediaries between humans and the forces of nature, sha-mans have existed since prehistoric times. It is now believed that drawings ofanimals found on the walls of caves in Lascaux, France, were used to per-form magical rituals designed to capture the spirits of the animals beinghunted. The word shaman is probably derived from the terms ‘Samarambi’ -to get excited, and ‘Sam-dambi’ - to dance. Shamans induce states of extremeexcitation by dancing to the beat of one or a number of drums. They thenenter a trance, during which they seem to be endowed with extraordinarypowers. In her study of shamanism, the anthropologist Mircea Eliade pre-sents an exhaustive list of these powers, which include phenomenon like te-lepathy, premonition, the ability to walk on fire, clairvoyance, etc.Whether induced by shamans during the course of a voodoo ceremony,or as part of any other cult ritual, it does seem that the trance state has adefinite therapeutic effect on the mind, liberating deeply imbedded archaicbehaviors that are generated by the rhinencephalon or olfactory brain, thepart of the brain associated with emotion. Problems arising from conflictsbetween the rhinencephalon and the neo-cortex (the part of the brain associ-ated with language and logic) are often resolved in this way. Once the rhi-nencephalon has had an opportunity to express itself, symptoms of conflictlike anxiety, phobias, etc., tend to disappear.A Brazilian doctor, inspired by a cult similar to voodoo, developed thewell known psychotherapeutic method called primal scream therapy, basedin this same principle."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 25Franz Anton MesmerBorn in 1734 in Weiler Germany, Mesmer wrote a doctoral thesis on the‘influence of the planets on the human body.’ He tried to demonstrate that akind of energy, which he called animal magnetism, originating in space, pen-etrates the body and has an impact on our health. The theory resembles thatof the oriental concept of vital energy, called Qi by the Chinese and prana bythe Hindus. Soviet and Czech researchers studying the phenomenon use theterms bioplasmic and psychotonic energy respectively.In their book on Soviet parapsychological research, Sheila Ostrander andLynn Schroeder report that a Czech researcher, Robert Pavlita, developed amotion-generating device that can be recharged with mental energy. Dr. JuliusKrmessky, a mathematician and physicist, submitted a report about the de-vice to members of the Physics and Science Institute in Trnava Czechoslova-kia. In the report he states: “The energy being generated to rotate the devicecannot be explained by fluctuations in temperature, static electricity or airflow. The energy can only be coming from the person using the device. Inaddition, the operator is able to control its output mentally. The energy passesthrough glass, wood, all kinds of metal, water, paper, etc., without any loss ofintensity or deviation in trajectory.”In France, an electrical engineer, L. Turenne, discovered what he called‘form waves,’ claiming that certain forms have the ability to focus energy. Ateam of researchers and doctors in Saclay, France, conducted further studiesand obtained interesting results concerning the impact of these waves onhealth, using a device called a ‘cosmic wave charger.’ Were the results due topsychological factors? Were subjects in any way predisposed to believe thatthe device would help cure their health problems? Or were the test resultsreally a confirmation of the existence of psychotronic energy? We’ll be takinga closer look at these and other related issues later on.But first, back to Mesmer. According to him, beneficial ‘cosmic fluid’ couldbe transferred from one subject to another. Using hand passes and other ges-tures, he actually succeeded in curing a number patients, arousing great hos-tility among many of his colleagues. His detractors seized on one incident to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 26create a scandal: a young woman named Maria Theresa Paradies, a pianist atthe court of the Empress of Austria, was suffering from partial blindness.While being treated by Mesmer, she became his mistress. After showing somesigns of improvement, she suffered a relapse and went completely blind someweeks later. Mesmer was forced to leave Vienna in disgrace.He returned to Paris where he rented rooms in a hotel (the Louis-le-Grand,still standing today at 16 Place Vendome). Instead of private consultations hebegan offering group seances (as one doctor later remarked, Mesmer actuallyinitiated the concept of group therapy!). It was here that he began using hisfamous device - a kind of reservoir filled with bottles of magnetized water.Rods made of iron were inserted into the bottles. Their protruding tips wereapplied to diseased organs. Subjects were joined together by a wire, in orderto ‘balance’ the flow of the cosmic fluid, while loud music was played on apiano (Mesmer loved music, especially Mozart, and is reputed to have intro-duced the harmonica to France).Wearing a purple robe, holding an iron wand in his hand, the ‘Master’would walk around the room touching patients at strategic points on theirback and stomach. Bailly, an astronomer and member of France’s Royal Acad-emy of Science, submitted a report on Mesmer. Here is an excerpt:“Some subjects feel nothing at all. Others spit and cough, feel local orgeneral heat, and sweat profusely. Others become agitated, and some evengo into convulsions. These convulsions are extraordinary, both in their fre-quency, duration and intensity. I have seen some cases where they continuedfor three hours. They are characterized by involuntary movements involvingall the limbs, and sometimes even the whole body, including tightening ofthe throat, fluttering of the hypochondria and epigastrium (upper and lowerabdomen), bulging eyes, piercing shouts, tears, hiccups and uncontrolledlaughter. They are preceded or followed by a state of languid reverie, as ifsubjects were exhausted or numb.“I also observed that many more women than men experienced thesekinds of reactions; that it took one or two hours for a crisis to reach its peak,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 27and that as soon as one subject began convulsing, all the others followed suit,and that in a very short time.” We can easily see how Mesmer’s subjects resemble those described inthe section on voodoo earlier on.Immense controversy arose concerning Mesmer’s work, largely fuelledby Mesmer himself who, like the Athenian general Alcibiades, knew the valueof publicity, whether it was good or bad.Mesmer’s two books, ‘Notes On The Discovery Of Animal Magnetism’ (1779)and ‘A Precise Account Of Facts Relating To Animal Magnetism’ (1781) ignited afury of controversy that could not be extinguished even after both the FrenchAcademy of Science and the Academy of Medicine issued an outright con-demnation of his work in 1784:“Having demonstrated through conclusive experimentation that pureimagination without magnetism can produce convulsions, and that magne-tism without imagination produces none, we can safely say that there is ab-solutely no proof of the existence of animal magnetism or cosmic fluid.”At the same time there was no lack of support for Mesmer’s theories. DeJussieu, a journalist, wrote a personal letter to the Academy of Medicine, inwhich he claimed to have witnessed a number of incontestable cures. Hesuggested that the Academy study Mesmer’s work more closely in order tolearn more about the phenomenon. Delon, one of Mesmer’s disciples andprinciple physician to the Count d’Artois, remarked that... “If medicine ofthe imagination works best, why not use it?”The controversy raged on long after the master himself had passed away.The beginnings of hypnotismThe Marquis de Puységur, a student of Mesmer, is accredited with hav-ing discovered a state of induced somnambulism, which later came to be"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 28known as hypnosis. When he made his discovery public in 1784, Mesmerminimized its importance, claiming that he knew of the phenomenon, butdid not consider it worthy of study. This product of the imagination, it seemedto him, would be very difficult, if not impossible to comprehend, and in anycase was much less interesting than the study of physiology.De Puységur, undaunted by the master’s criticism, continued to researchthe phenomenon on his own, and was amazed to find that some personsseemed to develop paranormal faculties while under hypnosis.In one case, he observed that a hypnotized subject was able to describethe evolution of his own disease, as well as those suffered by others, withextraordinary accuracy. It was de Puységur who first used the term ‘clairvoy-ance’ after he demonstrated that hypnotized patients who touched other pa-tients were able to detect which organs were affected with great precision. Asone patient said, “It’s as if I can actually feel what is happening inside thebody of the person I’m touching.”A reference in the Bible (Chronicles Two, Chapter XXXIII) refers to anattempt to harness various paranormal faculties: “He (Manasseh, King of Is-rael) observed times, and he used enchantments, and used witchcraft, anddealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards...”Three centuries before the birth of Christ, Druids combined hypnosis andmusic to induce a state which they called the ‘magic sleep.’When de Puységur published his findings he ran up against terrific resis-tance. But the facts were there for all to see, and disciples soon began spread-ing this new form of mesmerism, which transformed ordinary persons intoliving oracles, throughout Europe.Because of De Puységur’s work, people quickly lost interest in convul-sive trances as a therapeutic tool. In 1813, Abbot Faria offered a course inmagnetism that was open to the public at large. His approach became a pre-cursor to modern techniques of suggestion, and he is credited with coiningthe phrase ‘now you feel sleepy... very sleepy.’ Three years later, after a num-ber of embarrassing setbacks, he abandoned his work and sank into obscu-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 29rity. Magnetism remained an unreliable therapeutic tool, although it did yieldexcellent results in the hands of a few, notably Baron du Potet, Dr. JohnEliotson, Bertrand, La Fontaine and others. Bertrand discovered that staringat an inanimate object could induce a state of somnolence, but it was JamesBraid, a surgeon from Manchester England, who is credited with discoveringthe technique we now refer to as hypnosis in 1840.Braid was present at a demonstration of magnetism given by La Fontaine,during which he produced various ‘effects’ and treated sick subjects. Althoughhe had denounced La Fontaine as an imposter, believing neither in cosmicfluids or in paranormal faculties associated with trance states, Braid had toadmit that La Fontaine’s subjects found it impossible to open their eyes untilthey were told to do so by the hypnotist. He had always thought that one hadto stare directly into a subject’s eyes while performing passes. Braid formedhis own theory, claiming that although the eyes may be important for induc-ing a state of somnolence or hypnosis, it was not because of any special poweror magnetism, but simply because the eyes represented a shiny object to stareat.As soon as he got home he began verifying his hypothesis. He asked hismaid to stare at the blade of a scalpel. She soon fell into a deep sleep. Encour-aged by his success, he asked his wife to repeat the experiment, with thesame result.Braid theorized that it was visual fatigue, resulting from prolonged con-centration on a single object, that induced the state of sleep, which is why hecalled the process hypnosis, after the Greek ‘Hypnos,’ the name of a sleep-inducing demon. He published his findings in 1843, but they were largelyignored, and his work was soon forgotten.The Nancy SchoolIn 1859 Dr. A. Liébault, living near the town of Nancy in France, receiveda letter from a colleague which described how a certain Dr. Broca had beenable to perform an operation on a patient under hypnosis. Dr. Liébault, whohad expressed a previous interest in hypnotism, decided to pick up whereDr. Braid had left off. His method, which gradually evolved into the type of"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 30verbal suggestion used today, produced immediate results. He would tellpatients to concentrate on an object, and at the same time describe symptomsof somnolence - heavy eyelids, relaxed limbs, dulling of the senses, etc. Onone occasion he cured the patient of a colleague, who happened to be a highlyrespected member of the medical community. The evidence was plain for allto see - hypnosis did, indeed, exist, and could be used to cure people. Liébaultbecame a celebrity in the medical world.Although Liébault used suggestion to cure patients, he still maintainedan interest in Mesmer’s theory of magnetic fluids. Another colleague, Dr.Bernheim, refuted the fluid theory altogether. Under his influence, Liébaultdeveloped his method of hypnotic suggestion and its application as a way tocure disease, notably by introducing mental images of healing. Bernheim,who felt that results were due solely to the power of these suggestions, didnot consider it important to put patients into a deep hypnotic trance - theycould be induced to enter a state of mild reverie, or even remain fully awake.Liébault tried to be objective. “There is some truth in both approaches,” hewrote. “It is time we stopped accusing each other and let go of our imaginaryconvictions. Only then can we work together in complete understanding.”The other approach Liébault was referring to was that of the SalpêtriéreSchool.The Salpêtrière SchoolIn 1878 a neurologist at the height of his career, Dr. Charcot, became in-terested in hypnosis. Nicknamed the Caesar of Salpêtriére Hospital, Dr. Char-cot conducted experiments that he hoped would become the foundation of anew type of psychology, supported by pathological research. Unfortunately,he made a number of errors, one of which was to delegate the task of hypno-tizing subjects to other doctors and interns. He would then show up andpontificate in front of crowds of people who knew nothing at all about whathe was trying to achieve."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 31Nevertheless, his study of hysteria and his attempts at using suggestionto heal various health problems represented a first step in the evolution ofmodern psychology.Buoyed by his success, he went on to perform experiments on magne-tism and metallic therapy. Bernheim, however, pointed out a number of ob-vious errors in Charcot’s experiments, claiming that the results he obtainedwere due to suggestion. Towards the end of his life, Charcot himself begandoubting the validity of his findings, but did not live long enough to redirecthis research toward other areas.Hypnosis and the paranormalAs we mentioned earlier, the Marquis de Puységur reported that some ofhis subjects demonstrated remarkable clairvoyance while under hypnosis. Ifthat was really the case - if hypnotism could stimulate extrasensory percep-tion - then why were his findings not confirmed by other cases?One explanation may be that we see only what we want to see. A classicpsychological exercise consists of describing an event to someone, and thenhaving that person describe the same event to someone else, who in turndescribes it to someone else, and so on down the line. Invariably, the eventdescribed by the last person is very different from the original. For example,a western subject is shown a photograph depicting a black person, dressed intraditional North African clothes, being attacked by a European carrying aknife in a subway station. The subject reports what he or she has seen to asecond subject, and so on. By the time the story gets back to the psychologist,the roles have been reversed - the European is the one being attacked by theNorth African. Why? Because western subjects subconsciously found the ini-tial situation - a black person being attacked by a white person - intolerable,and rejected it.We can understand how difficult it is for so-called men of science to ad-mit that they may not be seeing all the facts. A good example is the way theFrench Academy of Medicine reacted to a report submitted by Dr. Husson in1832. Husson had been asked to head a commission to investigate paranor-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 32mal phenomena, and spent six years conducting experiments and gatheringdata before drawing up his report. The Academy reacted to his findings withconsternation - the report was not at all what they had expected to hear:“Husson, who had performed a series of spectacular experiments on clair-voyance and healing over distances, officially confirmed the existence of thehypnotic state, the ability to predict events, the ability to read while blind-folded, and so on.”Fearing ridicule, the Academy refused to publish Husson’s report. A newstudy, led by Dr. Dubois, a virulent adversary of magnetism, was commis-sioned. Dubois refuted all of Husson’s findings, including the existences ofan induced state of hypnosis.Was Husson’s original report frivolous and unscientific? Not accordingto a study of hypnosis commissioned by the British Medical Association in1953, which confirmed many of his findings, and went so far as to say that ...“the conclusions in (Dr. Husson’s) report demonstrated remarkable foresight,and are, in large part, still valid today.”In 1850, an English professor of physiology, Dr. Mayo, himself a hypno-tist, wrote:“A hypnotized subject who has been deprived of his own sense of touch,taste or smell, will perceive everything that is felt, tasted or smelled by thehypnotist .”Mayo’s experiments confirmed the findings of another researcher, Dr.Azam, working in France fifteen years earlier. In 1875 Professor U.F. Barret,the great English physician, conducted a series of similar experiments:“I took a few items out of my pantry and arranged them on a table next tome. Standing behind a young female subject whose eyes were carefully blind-folded, I put a bit of salt on my tongue. The girl spit some saliva and ex-claimed, ‘Why did you put salt in my mouth?’ When I repeated the processwith some sugar she said, ‘Oh, that’s much better.’ When I asked her whatthe taste was, she said, ‘It’s sugar.’ I went on to taste mustard, pepper, ginger,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 33and so on. The girl named every one of these substances, and was apparentlyable to taste them herself when I put them in my mouth. Next, I brought myhand close to a lighted candle, slightly burning my skin. The girl, still sittingwith her back to me and blindfolded, cried out in pain, and said that herhand was being burned.”Charcot, although guilty of some errors, also worked with subjects in astate of hypnotic trance, and would begin his lectures by saying, “We willstick to the simple facts, and set aside more complex phenomena like mag-netic fluids and second sight, at least for the moment.” On the other hand, hedid not categorically deny them.Members of the Nancy School were interested in similar phenomena. OnJanuary 9, 1886, Liébault and a colleague, Stanislas de Guaita, submitted areport of the following experiment:“We, the undersigned, Ambroise Liébault, doctor of medicine, and Stanislas deGuaita, author, both residing in the city of Nancy, do hereby certify havingobtained the following results:1. Miss Louise L., in a state of magnetic sleep, was told that she would have toanswer questions which would be communicated to her mentally, without theuse of words or gestures. Dr. Liébault placed his hand on the woman’s foreheadand concentrated on the question ‘When will you get better?’ After a momentthe woman’s lips began trembling. ‘Soon,’ she said, quite distinctly. She wasthen asked, before all present, to repeat the question that had been mentallycommunicated to her. This she did, formulating the question exactly.2. Mr. De Guaita, placing his hand on the woman’s forehead, mentally formulatedthe following question, once again using no words or gestures: ‘Will you comeback here next week?’‘Perhaps,’ the woman responded. When asked to tell the witnesses present whatthe question had been she replied, ‘I wanted to know if you would be returningnext week.’ The way she phrased the question, reversing the pronouns ‘I’ and‘you,’ is significant - an indication that she had literally entered the mind of thehypnotist."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 343. Without saying a single word, Dr. Liébault then wrote the following statementon a sheet of paper: ‘When Miss L. awakens, she will think her black hat hasbeen transformed into a red hat.’The sheet of paper was passed around to all the witnesses, after whichDr. Liébault and Mr. De Guaita, in complete silence, placed their hands onMiss L’s forehead, concentrating on the message. Before being awakened, theyoung woman was told that she would see something unusual.As soon as she was brought out of her trance she stared at her hat andburst out laughing. It wasn’t her hat, she said, she didn’t want it. Yes, it lookedlike her hat, but she knew they were just playing a joke on her. She wantedher own hat back.“What’s different about this hat?” someone asked.“You can see for yourself! You have eyes, don’t you?”“Tell us what it is.”We had to insist for quite some time before she would actually tell ushow her hat had changed - she thought we were making fun of her.“You can see very well that it’s red.”Since she absolutely refused to use the hat, we had to put her back into atrance to show her it really was her hat. Dr. Liébault picked it up and blew onit, having told her that it would revert to its original color when he did. Awak-ened once again, she picked up her hat as if nothing had happened.We certify that this report is an accurate description of the results ob-tained during the hypnosis session, conducted without any prior prepara-tion or knowledge on the part of the subject.”Such experiments left little doubt in the minds of enthusiasts that hypno-sis would live up to its promise - the ancient age of mysticism and miracles"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 35was about to dawn once again. Others, however, were more than a little wor-ried by the possibility. One powerful adversary was the Catholic Church,which accused La Fontaine of blasphemy for trying to imitate the miracles ofChrist. This was no laughing matter. La Fontaine was actually imprisoned,then released after King Ferdinand of Naples intervened on his behalf, oncondition that... “he cease restoring sight to the blind, and hearing to thedeaf.”La Fontaine eventually managed to obtain a private audience with PopePius IX. After a long discussion, the Pope decreed that La Fontaine was notattempting to imitate the miracles of Christ, and encouraged him to continuewith his work.The dawn of the twentieth century saw a marked decline in the develop-ment of hypnosis as a therapeutic tool. No more Mesmer, no more Charcot,no more rivalries and scandals. One of Charcot’s former students, SigmundFreud, introduced a new form of treatment for mental disorders, which hecalled psychoanalysis. Emile Coué, a pharmacist and member of the NancySchool, developed a method of suggestion (the Coué Method) which usedthe waking rather than the hypnotic state to heal the sick. Since techniques ofanesthesia were being perfected, hypnosis was no longer necessary in orderto perform operations.Public opinion did an about-face: people condemned what they had pre-viously found fascinating. A host of detractors attacked practitioners of hyp-nosis, claiming they were all charlatans. A judge ordered one hypnotist topay heavy damages for having caused a young woman to develop variousproblems during a theatrical demonstration. Such theatrical entertainmentsdid much to tarnish the image of hypnotism in general. This is not surpris-ing, considering the kinds of absurd antics subjects were instructed to per-form: walking on all fours, howling like a dog, undressing in front of an audi-ence, etc.Because of the bad publicity directed at hypnotism in general, legitimatepractitioners found it increasingly difficult to get subjects to cooperate. It of-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 36ten took a number of sessions before a subject was finally able to attain thetrance state, and in many instances subjects remained resistant to the end.Suggestion over distancesPierre Janet, a young doctor who would later become a Professor at theMedical College of France, assumed the role of defending the legitimacy ofhypnosis as a therapeutic tool, emphasizing an approach which he calledmental suggestion.Invited by a colleague, Dr. Gilbert, to investigate the case of a youngpeasant woman named Léonie, who apparently could be hypnotized from adistance, Janet ended up performing over twenty-two experiments similar tothe one described below:“Here is a list of precautions taken to ensure the validity of the test:1. The exact time of the intervention is to be drawn at random.2. Dr. Gibert will be informed of the time only a few minutes beforehand, at whichpoint members of the observing team will proceed to the subject’s domicile.3. Neither the subject or anyone residing within one kilometer of the subject’sdomicile will have any prior knowledge of the time or type of experiment that isto be carried out. In addition, neither myself nor any member of the observingteam are to enter the subject’s domicile in order to verify whether she is asleepor not.“It was decided to repeat an experiment previously conducted byCagliostro: hypnotize the subject from a distance and have her traverse thecity in order to locate Dr. Gibert.“At eight thirty in the evening, Dr. Gibert consented to perform the test.The exact hour was drawn from a hat: the mental intervention was to beginat five minutes to nine, and continue for fifteen minutes, i.e. until ten afternine. At that time no one was at the subject’s domicile excepting Léonie and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 37the cook, Madame B., who knew nothing whatsoever of our intentions. Be-ing alone in the house, the two women had decided to get comfortable in theliving room, where they amused themselves by playing the piano.“We reached the vicinity of the subject’s domicile shortly after nine o’clock.Outside all was quiet, the street deserted. Without causing any commotion,our party split up into two groups in order to survey the premises more ef-fectively.“At nine twenty-five I saw the silhouette of a person appear at the doorleading to the garden. It was Léonie. I remained hidden in the shadows, whereI could watch and hear without being seen. But there was nothing further,either to see or hear - after standing in the doorway for a moment the girlclosed the door behind her and disappeared into the garden.“(At this point Dr. Gibert gave up his efforts to communicate with thegirl. Apparently, concentrating so hard for so long had caused him to fall intoa faint. It was nine thirty-five when he regained consciousness.)“At nine thirty the girl reappeared at the door. This time she marchedstraight out into the street, without any hesitation whatsoever. She appearedto be looking for someone, and seemed in a hurry, as if she were late for anappointment and absolutely had to reach her destination. The group watch-ing from the street had no time to warn either myself or my partner, Dr. Myers.Hearing hurried footsteps approaching, we followed the girl, who seemednot to be aware of her surroundings. In any case, she made no sign of havingrecognized or even seen us.“When she reached the rue du Bard she slowed down and seemed tofalter. She stopped for a moment, swaying from side to side, as if she wasabout to fall over. Then she started walking again. The time was nine thirty-five (we learned later that it was precisely at nine thirty-five that Dr. Giberthad regained consciousness and resumed concentrating). The girl walkedquickly, taking no notice of her surroundings, or of the group of observersfollowing her."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 38“It took about ten minutes for us all to reach Dr. Gibert’s house. Thinkingthe experiment had failed, and surprised that we had not yet returned, Dr.Gibert had just set out to find us when he encountered the sleepwalking girl.She seemed not to recognize him. Completely absorbed in her hypnotic trance,she entered the house and hurried up the stairs, followed closely by us all.Dr. Gibert was about to enter his examining room, but I took his arm and ledhim to another room across the hall.“The girl, who now appeared very agitated, was looking everywhere,bumping into objects and observers, feeling nothing. She wandered into theexamining room, stumbling into furniture, and repeating in a mournful tone,‘Where is he? Where is Dr. Gibert?’“During this time Dr. Gibert remained seated in a chair in the room acrossthe hall, without making the slightest movement. The girl entered the roomand walked right past him, almost touching him, but in her excitement shedid not recognize him. It then occurred to Dr. Gibert to resume his mentalcommunication with her, in order to draw her to him. As soon as he did (thismight have been pure coincidence) she turned around, seeming to recognizehim all at once, and seized his hands. ‘I found you!’ she cried. ‘Oh, I’m sohappy I found you at last!’ She was overcome with such joy that she actuallyjumped up and down on a couch and began clapping her hands.”This report, submitted by Professor Ochorowicz of the University ofLemberg (the excerpt is from his book ‘Concerning Mental Suggestion,’ pub-lished in 1889) concerns one of the first experiments in which Dr. Janet par-ticipated. Janet published his own account in 1885. Sixteen out of a total oftwenty-two experiments were considered successful. Janet stated: “Can webelieve that the results obtained during these sixteen experiments were dueto pure coincidence? That would not be reasonable. Is it possible, then, thatinvoluntary suggestions were made by witnesses or others directly or indi-rectly involved? All I can say, and this I declare in perfect sincerity, is that wetook all possible precautions to prevent that from happening. Our conclu-sion, therefore, is the following: these phenomena should be reproduced andstudied in greater depth.”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 39And yet, after a couple of years of continued interest, no more was heardabout the experiments. Janet himself became more involved in studying hyp-nosis as part of a larger field which he called ‘psychological medicine,’ anearly attempt to understand and treat what have come to be known as psy-chosomatic disorders.A celebrated physiologist and Nobel prize winner, Charles Richet, hadbeen studying suggestion over distances since 1873. He pursued the experi-ments begun by Janet and Gibert on the young woman Léonie, then aban-doned this line of investigation when he developed what was to become themost important research tool in the study of psychology and parapsychology- the application of statistical data and probability curves to paranormal ex-periments conducted on subjects in a waking state.Why did he abandon pure hypnosis? No doubt because of the vagaries ofthe procedure, and the fierce opposition he encountered among members ofthe medical profession and other men of science towards anything that hadto do with the paranormal. This opposition, as John W. Campbell noted, wasdemocratic in nature: society was refusing to admit that all men were, per-haps, not created equal, since only one subject out of a hundred seemed giftedwith paranormal abilities while under hypnosis. By studying normal sub-jects in a waking state, he could avoid wrangling with detractors of hypnosis,and at the same time hopefully offer irrefutable proof of the existence of te-lepathy and other parapsychological faculties, at least in their latent state, inall individuals.Richet himself had occasional premonitory dreams, and thought theymight represent the first stage in some kind of gradual process of humanevolution. With this in mind, he devoted all his efforts to the study of para-psychology.The decline of hypnosisSigmund Freud preferred working with patients in a waking state ratherthan in an hypnotic state as he attempted to treat mental illness. Emile Coué,carrying on the tradition of the Nancy School, also rejected hypnosis, using"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 40the power of suggestion on conscious subjects to try and cure physical healthproblems. Along with Richet (and Rhine working in the United States), moreand more researchers interested in parapsychology would abandon hypno-sis in favor of gathering statistical data on subjects possessing the ability tomanipulate dice and cards, or perform acts of psycho-kinesis (mental dis-placement of objects) and telepathy (mental communication), all during thewaking state.A new era of paranormal research had begun. Hypnosis came to be per-ceived more and more as a spectacle rather than a subject worthy of seriousscientific study. Hector Durville (who did manage to gain official recognitionfor his ‘school of public magnetism’) had himself locked up in a cage of lionsand succeeded in putting them all into an hypnotic trance! A few of his stu-dents, notably P.C. Jagot, Colonel de Rochas, Doctor Lancelin, and his sonsGaston and Henri Durville, nevertheless managed to keep the flame alivethrough the first half of the twentieth century.However, in France between 1920 and 1950, most scientists did not hesi-tate to deny the very existence of hypnosis, claiming that it was simply thesimulation of a trance state by subjects who were, in fact, perfectly awake.Hypnotists themselves were either accomplices or dupes of this chicanery.Fortunately, research did continue in other countries, including the U.S., Ger-many, England, Russia and Spain.The study of suggestion over distances, initiated by Janet, was devel-oped to a much more sophisticated degree by the Russian physiologist L.L.Vassiliev. One of Vassiliev’s colleagues, Ivan Pavlov, offered a physiologicalexplanation of hypnosis that did much to enhance its credibility among mem-bers of the scientific community. In Germany, J.A. Schultz developed a relax-ation method that used verbal suggestions to describe the physical effects ofhypnosis (I am calm... my arms and legs feel heavy... my right arm feelsvery warm... etc.). In 1960, a student of Schultz, Alfredo Caycedo, developeda therapeutic method which he called sophrology, using the equivalent of amild hypnotic trance to treat patients suffering from a variety of disorders."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"HypnosisPage 41 The technique, which has been gaining in popularity the world over, isthe subject of our next chapter."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 42SophrologyA friend of mine received a brochure in the mail one day.

I was impressed as he offered an account of hisexploits.“How many persons do you think are practicing hypnosis at this verymoment?” he asked. Not waiting for an answer he continued. “Thousands.There are thousands of clandestine hypnotists playing around with people’sminds, many using their own versions of occult practices, magic, parallelmedicine, amateur psychoanalysis, and so on.”It was in order to purge hypnotism of its ambiguous image, its unfortu-nate association with charlatanism and the occult, that Alfonso Caycedo haddecided to coin the term ‘sophrology.’“Despite the persistent efforts of some doctors to disassociate the studyof hypnosis from its mystical origins, the forces of myth and magic provedtoo strong to overcome. The work of these pioneers of the scientific study ofhypnotic phenomena has been completely overshadowed by the often spec-tacular displays offered by magicians, illusionists and music-hall perform-ers, as well as by some practitioners of the occult sciences and new-age thrillseekers, always on the lookout for the unusual or bizarre.“We are in favor of the abolition of the word ‘hypnosis’ from medicalterminology, not only because we consider it to be an inaccurate descriptionof these phenomena, but more importantly because the word itself is chargedwith a whole range of contradictory emotional reactions. This makes it verydifficult to use as a therapeutic tool - doctors find themselves constantly hav-ing to reassure patients and dispel implied associations with magic and mys-tery.” (Quoted from Hypnosis, Sophrology and Medicine by G.R. Rager, FayardPublishing, 1974)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 44Was he telling me that all he’d done was substitute one word for another,without making any changes in method or philosophy? As I soon discov-ered, that was not the case.Sophrology is a scienceAs we said earlier, sophrology is a science, concerned not only with hyp-nosis, but with all related phenomena - relaxation, yoga, Zen meditation - infact, all techniques that aim to induce changes in our ordinary state of con-sciousness. So as you can see, sophrology covers a much broader range ofphenomena than hypnosis alone.Sophrology is a philosophyThe philosophy of sophrology is probably its most interesting aspect. Inclassical hypnosis, the hypnotist always assumed a dominant role in relationto his or her subject, issuing commands which were sometimes contradictoryto the will or desire of the subject in question. I once heard a hypnotist at-tending a conference on sophrology utter the following statement: “Why wastetime teaching subjects to relax? Even if they don’t want to, all you have to dois force them - put them under, then suggest that they feel calm and relaxed.It’s so easy!”That is exactly the kind of attitude that sophrology is opposed to. Soph-rology is designed to teach and guide people, not subjugate their will. It doesnot cure people in spite of themselves. Instead, it helps people cure them-selves by creating a harmonious ‘sophrological’ alliance between therapistand patient.Sophrology is a methodSophrology uses a number of techniques to help subjects attain a state ofdeep relaxation. In this state the mind is able to control and alter physicalprocesses, with verbal expression - also called terpnos logos - acting as theintermediary between the two."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 46We’ll be taking a close look at one of the techniques used to induce thisspecial state a little further on.The main difference between sophrology and hypnosis lies in the rela-tionship between therapist and subject. In sophrology, subjects play an activerole in attaining the proper mental state by relaxing, both mentally and physi-cally. They are then taught how to regulate their own organic functions, andcorrect imbalances. In classical hypnosis, on the other hand, subjects are com-pletely passive. The hypnotist does all the work, first by relaxing a subject,and then by substituting his or her own thoughts for those of the subjectthrough suggestion.We could draw a comparison to teaching methods: hypnosis resemblesthe classical approach of instruction, which relies heavily on forced memori-zation and repetition, while sophrology is more akin to the modern approachof learning through participation and free inquiry.The area designated by dotted lines corresponds to superior levels ofawareness attained by skilled practitioners of yoga.States:Pathological awarenessOrdinary awarenessSophrological awarenessLevels:WAKINGSOPHROLIMINAL LEVELSLEEPCOMADEATHQualitative changesQuantitative changesExample of sophronizationSophrology and parapsychology"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 47Sophrology, then, incorporates the positive aspects of hypnosis, but de-velops its application to a much higher degree.Officially, Doctor Caycedo rejects any connection between sophrologyand parapsychology. It is his view that since paranormal phenomena are notcommonly observed in all individuals, they are beyond the scope ofsophrological study.Although this explanation, offered at the First International Congress onSophrology in Barcelona, may have satisfied most of those present, we feel itis still not adequate, for the following reasons: Firstly, as we will see later on, certain paranormal phenomena can betriggered in all individuals, using sophrological methods. Caycedo’s aim wasto separate sophrology from parapsychology altogether, in order to ensuregreater respectability for the new approach. This was understandable, in lightof the fact that many psychiatrists, psychologists and doctors had alreadyexpressed hostile opinions about the new discipline, even though they knewhardly anything about it. Getting involved in a debate about paranormalphenomena would only have confused the issue and impede any progresshe hoped to achieve. We mustn’t forget that, despite the efforts of certaingovernments and a number of serious researchers, notably in the U.S. andRussia, the view that parapsychology is tainted by association with charla-tans and fringe cults predominated among a vast majority of people. Al-though shortsighted, this kind of skepticism concerning anything evenvaguely associated with the paranormal was deeply imbedded and extremelywidespread.The fact remains, however, that many sophrologists have encounteredsurprising incidents in the course of their practice, incidents that cannot beexplained by the existence of ESP alone.Freud considered telepathy and clairvoyance vestiges of faculties thatwere indispensable to prehistoric man. Telepathy was necessary in order tocommunicate, and clairvoyance in order to survive in a generally hostile en-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 48vironment. As man’s logic and reason developed, these faculties became in-creasingly atrophied, although they have still remained engraved in our cells,and can therefore be reactivated. To do this, our logical, rational mind, cen-tered in a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex, must be subdued, leav-ing room for more primitive mental functions, centered in the rhinencepha-lon or olfactory brain, to operate. Over the course of human evolution, theprimitive olfactory brain was covered over by the cerebral cortex. Alteredstates of consciousness, induced by various means, allow intuitive data torise to the surface of our awareness.Here are a few examples:By developing his faculties of relaxation and concentration, a Russianresearcher, Karl Nikolaiev, was able to demonstrate amazing powers of te-lepathy. Before receiving a telepathic message, Nikolaiev would usually re-quire about half an hour to achieve a state of total relaxation.Mylan Ryzl, a biochemist who became interested in parapsychology, andmore specifically in the development of paranormal faculties, used hypnosisand suggestion to help a colleague, Pavel Stépanek, become one of the great-est mediums of our time.Home, the celebrated British medium, always relaxed before his demon-strations. Alla Vinogradova, the wife of a Russian physician, used autogenictraining (a form of self hypnosis) to develop powers of psychokinesis. Marcotteand Mendez, both specialists in telepathy, also used autogenic training todevelop their paranormal faculties.Thought healers like Edgar Cayce, Isaltina, Arigo, Chapman and othersplaced themselves in a trance state to effect their cures. And, in fact, the trancestate is nothing more than a transition from one state of consciousness toanother.Staring at anything - a crystal, a coffee bean, a pendulum, etc. - will in-duce a semi-hypnotic state. Oracles of old, like the one at Delphi in ancientGreece, used noxious gas (probably a kind of drug) to achieve the same re-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 49sult, while mystics concentrated on their navel or on the blood of a sacrificedanimal, and shamans relied on rhythm and dance.Eugene Caslant, attempting to devise a method for developingsupranormal faculties, recommended a state ‘between waking and sleep’ asideal.Since sophrology incorporates all of these approaches, evaluating, repro-ducing and ultimately applying them for therapeutic purposes, it seems theideal tool for the exploration of paranormal faculties.But how to proceed?Caycedo, a student of Schultz and founder of sophrology, concluded thatautogenic training was the best technique for inducing the desired state.Autogenic TrainingThe year is 1908. Hypnosis is in decline, as far as its therapeutic use isconcerned. Criticism centers around the fact that subjects are completely pas-sive and dependent on the hypnotist, enabling suggestions to be made thatmay run counter to their better judgement.J.H. Schultz a young doctor fascinated by a new discipline called psycho-therapy, became interested in hypnosis and suggestion, claiming that it ispossible for certain gifted and cultivated individuals to enter a state of hyp-nosis of their own accord, simply through an effort of will (the idea of selfhypnosis had originally been proposed by Oscar Vogt).When questioned about what they saw and felt, subjects would oftenreport an initial impression of chiaroscuro, like a twilit space, which wouldsoon start filling with spots, veils, lines, shadows and shapes. All these im-ages seemed to appear against the backdrop of the eyelids, in so-called visualspace, similar to what you see after staring at a bright light and then turningaway or closing your eyes."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 50Schultz called this first stage the amorphous stage, during which the mindis still oriented outward, towards exterior events.According to Schultz, the next stage is characterized by the visualizationof thoughts. In most cases these images are of past events, arising like se-quences in a film, with the subject as spectator. In some cases images aresymbolic representations of ideas, rather than actual events. It is also duringthis phase that remarkable perceptive changes may occur, especially in visu-ally oriented subjects. For example, visual space can shift to an area directlybehind, instead of in front of, a subject.Was Schultz describing some kind of clairvoyant phenomenon? Well, notexactly. But as we’ll see later on, this stage, characterized by an increasinginteriorization of consciousness, does lend itself to the development of extra-sensory perception (ESP) in some subjects.Next comes the third stage, during which strange images arise in the mind.The images seem extraordinarily real: objects, forms and colors, all linked tothe subject’s unique personality, unfold in a series of metamorphosing scenes.Subjects also report experiencing physical sensations, notably heavinessand heat in various parts of the body.It occurred to Schultz to try and develop a method of self hypnosis wheresubjects could make suggestions to themselves that would cause these samesensations of heat and heaviness to arise. Why? Because a feeling of heavi-ness is an indication of muscular relaxation, while heat indicates a dilation ofperipheral blood vessels.Schultz considered these two physiological characteristics to be the basisof the state of ‘disassociation’ he deemed necessary for the liberation of intui-tive, as opposed to rational, thought processes.He called his method autogenic training or autogenic relaxation, defin-ing it as a system of physiological exercises carefully designed to induce astate of general disassociation from external stimuli in the organism, with the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 51resulting state of consciousness facilitating all therapies based on suggestion,autosuggestion, mental conditioning, and so on.For that reason, autogenic training (A.T.) became the basis for more elabo-rate therapeutic techniques, including sophrology.One major benefit of autogenic training is that it enables people who suf-fer from insomnia to reestablish regular sleep patterns. Another benefit is theelimination of the almost constant nervous and muscular tension - or stress -associated with a modern urban lifestyle, which in turn results in glandularabnormalities, causing disorders like ulcers, cardiac and respiratory disease,etc.Therefore, in addition to facilitating the development of paranormal fac-ulties, autogenic relaxation improves physical health as it relaxes the bodyand allows the subconscious mind to express itself with much greater free-dom.How To Relax With A.T.It takes a few months to master the technique of autogenic training (seeAppendix 1) on your own. For that reason, the help of a second person -usually a trained sophrologist or hypnotist - is recommended, in order tospeed up the process. With such a person to guide you, results can be ob-tained almost immediately.Subjects are told to concentrate on a given object to prevent the mindfrom wandering, and are then given a series of instructions, resembling thefollowing:Think: I am completely calm.

For our purposes, however, we can limit ourselves to three:• Autogenic training (as described above, with the help of a second per-son);• Yoga nidra (focussing on parts of the body);• Alfredo Caycedo’s Dynamic relaxation.Yoga NidraYoga nidra, or the yoga of waking sleep, consists of a complex series ofexercises designed to induce the sophronic state. Caycedo developed the tech-nique while studying with some of the greatest yoga masters in India at thetime. Which exercises are used depends on the subject. Some, like focussingyour awareness on each body part, are extremely pleasurable.When we are in an active, waking state, our awareness or consciousnessis focussed outward, on external stimuli and perceptions. We perceive littleof what is going on inside our body, although bodily functions are accompa-nied by a host of sounds and other sensations. These interior stimuli are gen-erally filtered out by our cerebral cortex.Yoga nidra helps people tune in to their own body. Here is an example ofa yoga nidra exercise, based on an excerpt from Dennis Boyes’ excellent work,‘The Yoga Of Waking Sleep:’Focus your attention on your forehead.Now shift your attention down slightly, to your right eye.Concentrate on your right eye.Explore it.Feel the spherical shape of your eyeball.Try to feel your whole eye, gently, completely, without letting anymental images or thoughts get in the way."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 55(Beat)Now concentrate on your left eye.(Instructions are repeated)Now shift your focus to your right cheek.Feel it, feel it deeply.You are completely present, completely focussed.(Repeat with the left cheek)Now shift your awareness to your right ear.Feel the flesh of your outer ear.Now guide your attention inside your ear.Concentrate on your inner ear, on the auditory canal.Feel the walls of your inner ear... etc.All bodily parts, as well as other sensations like blood pulsing throughthe veins, cellular vibrations, the feeling of clothes in contact with the skin,and so on, are explored in this way.Subjects who are willing to make the effort can attain the desired state of‘disconnectedness’ by concentrating on almost any sensation, whether it be asound, an image, an odor or an object. You can practice while taking the sun,relaxing in a hammock, steaming in a sauna, or sitting in your favorite easychair. Just tune in to your inner sensations and let yourself go. You will soonfeel yourself floating away in a very pleasant bubble of physical and mentalrelaxation.Terpnos LogosIn sophrology the main instrument of suggestion (we should perhapsuse the word instruction, since subjects are awake) is called terpnos logos, aterm Caycedo revived from the Greek.Caycedo noticed that a certain quality and rhythm of voice was moreeffective on subjects than others. As he reread ancient Greek authors, he cameacross a text that seemed to be an early attempt at verbal therapy. In theCharmides Dialog Plato tells Charmides, one of his disciples, how to cure themind and body, beginning with the terpnos logos, a kind of gentle monotone"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 56resembling an incantation, which induces a state of relaxation, total concen-tration and mental calm required for the verbal treatment of physical or psy-chological disorders.Caycedo explains how to adopt the right tone: “Adopt a tone that is asfamiliar and relaxed as possible. Your voice should reverberate, as if it werecoming from inside the subject, as if it were the subject’s own voice, resonat-ing deep within himself.”The subject’s own voice, resonating deep within himself... If we take thenotion one step further, we could say that it really is a subject’s own innervoice that is most effective for orienting the mind. Unfortunately, in mostcases this inner voice communicates negative messages: ‘I’m so stupid... Ican’t take it any longer... I’m nervous... I’m afraid... I feel sick... I’m fedup...’ and so on. The accumulated effects of these negative messages, far frombeing harmless, can actually result in physical or mental health problems.There is nothing new about the notion that negative thoughts can have aharmful impact on behavior and health. Korzibski, a Russian researcher, ob-served that verbal formulations like ‘I’m always clumsy with members of theopposite sex...’ or ‘I knew I could never be successful...’ or ‘I have a terriblememory...’ etc. have a paralyzing effect on the individual.As Buddha said, ‘We are who we think we are.’ Our thoughts, formu-lated as verbal phrases, resonate inside us much like Caycedo’s terpnos logosis meant to do, although often with negative results, conditioning our mindwithout our being aware of it.Saying ‘I don’t like this or that...’ or ‘I am this or that...’ stems from astatic vision of the self, when in fact the self is in a constant state of evolution.Personal development is a dynamic, rather than a static process, so any opin-ion you may have about yourself is really only temporary.A Little Neuropsychology"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 57To better understand the sophrological process, let’s take a look at somerudiments of brain physiology. The main components of the human braininclude:• The neo-cortex: a distinguishing trait of primates, the neo-cortex is theseat of conceptual intelligence and reason.• The rhinencephalon or olfactory brain acts as a link between the neo-cortex and the more archaic parts of the brain. It controls olfactory functions(from whence its name), is the seat of emotions and instinct, regulates stress,and can facilitate healing or strengthen the body’s resistance to disease. Italso regulates altered states of consciousness, and is responsible for produc-ing various associated phenomena, including the separation of mind and body(also known as astral travelling), déjà-vu, shifts in time / space perception,hallucinations, extra sensorial perceptions, and so on.• The thalamus, hypothalamus and corpus striatum comprise the oldestpart of the brain, and control innate nervous system functions, metabolism,respiration, and so on.Using terpnos logos, the persuasive language of sophrology, therapistsare able to stimulate the olfactory brain to liberate or condition certain func-tions under its control. This process can, on occasion, produce spectacularcures. In addition, most research tends to confirm that paranormal facultiesoriginate in the more primitive levels of our being, i.e. those controlled by theolfactory brain.As we said earlier, terpnos logos (T.L.) is an effective tool for unblockingsuch intuitive faculties.Here lies the great difference between sophrology and hypnosis. Con-sider this definition of hypnotic suggestion: ‘The state of having a belief, anidea or a desire, when that belief, idea or desire originates in the consciousmind of another person (the hypnotist) without the subject being aware ofthe outside influence exerted by the hypnotist.’In a sense, hypnotism bypasses the neo-cortex completely, leaving sub-jects stripped of any rational thought, willpower or self control."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 58Sophrology, on the other hand, does not attempt to short-circuit the neo-cortex, since verbal instructions are first perceived and processed by that partof the brain. It is only after the mind has become calm, entering a state be-tween waking and sleep, that subconscious intuitive factors come into play.For that reason, subjects undergoing sophrological therapy always retain theirrationality and self control.Caycedo’s Dynamic RelaxationIn order for sophrological therapy to be effective, subjects must first becompletely relaxed. The same is true for autogenic training and yoga nidra.In tribal cults like voodoo or Ubanda, in mesmerism, trance therapy, etc.induction is usually achieved through the repetition of some type of physicalactivity.Caycedo had the idea of developing a series of what he called dynamicrelaxation exercises. He collected techniques from various eastern sources(yoga, Zen Buddhism, etc.), evaluated their effectiveness by measuring re-sults on an EEG (electroencephalogram) and then organized the best of theminto a three-step method. Why did he turn to the east for inspiration? Simplybecause eastern philosophies seem more oriented towards exploring theworkings of the inner mind than those developed here in the west - the sepa-ration of mind and body is so deeply engraved in our culture that, despite anoverwhelming amount of research showing the fundamental link betweenthe two, many people still cannot understand how physical exercise, for ex-ample, can have an impact on the way they think or feel.Respecting the order in which human faculties evolved, Caycedo hassubjects start with a series of physical exercises, based on postures and move-ments inspired by a form of yoga called raja yoga. This constitutes the firststage in his three-stage method. The second stage is based on various typesof Buddhist and Hindu meditations, while the third stage is based on Zentechniques."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 59Dynamic relaxation, combining oriental and sophrological methods, isusually taught to groups. Entering a sophronic state greatly enhances theeffects of physical movements, and makes them easier to learn. Mostsophrological therapists combine autogenic training and dynamic relaxation,sometimes obtaining spectacular results, notably in patients suffering frompsychosomatic problems.Dynamic relaxation is Caycedo’s most important contribution tosophrology. During autogenic training, the mind is aware of sensations thatare ordinarily very difficult to perceive because the body is in a state of al-most total repose. Dynamic relaxation, on the other hand, first stimulatesmuscles and organs, allowing the mind to concentrate on inner perceptionsonly during recuperation periods.From a physiological point of view, it is this recuperation period that ismost important. Caycedo was astonished to meet yogis in India who couldprovide perfect descriptions of their inner organs, without ever having seenan anatomical model or diagram. They could actually feel the inside of theirbody. And, in fact, the brain contains certain receptors, called proprioceptors,that most people hardly ever use. Yogis, on the other hand, develop thesereceptors to the point where they can feel, and even modify, physiologicalfunctions.By devising a technique - dynamic relaxation - that provides the sameresults, Caycedo helped his patients achieve a balance of mind and body, andan awareness of their own physical makeup, enabling them to effectivelycombat a host of health problems of psychosomatic origin.American therapists were working along the same lines when they de-veloped an electronic biofeedback device: electrodes attached to a patient’sbody were used in place of proprioceptors, allowing researchers to detectphysiological sensations that could then be transformed into auditory of vi-sual signals."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 60Caycedo’s approach was much more organic: instead of replacing un-used cerebral circuits with a machine, he taught his patients how to developtheir own proprioceptive faculties, in harmony with themselves.Applications of dynamic relaxationMany pregnant women suffer from so-called morning sickness as theirbody assumes its new shape. Nausea and vomiting stem from an unconsciousrejection of the fetus, which is perceived as a foreign body. Dynamic relax-ation helps future mothers become aware of their new corporeal structure,causing morning sickness to disappear.Athletes can improve their performance by developing an awarenessof the physiological effects training has on their body, and by transformingequipment (skis, paddles, balls, javelins, etc.) into extensions of their ownbody. The process resembles what happens when you buy a new car: at first,unsure of the vehicle’s dimensions, you have to be extra careful not to runinto anything when you drive. But in only a few weeks the car’s structurebecomes so deeply engraved in your brain that you can avoid obstacles byonly a couple of inches with hardly any thought or effort. In other words,you develop an intuitive awareness of the car as an extension of your body.The same applies to athletes: skiers who do dynamic relaxation exercises whilewearing their equipment, for example, can considerably enhance their per-formance.In 1967, Dr. Raymond Abrezol was hired to teach dynamic relaxation tothe Swiss national ski team, which had done poorly in previous competi-tions. Peter Baumgartner, who headed the team’s technical operations, hadheard of Dr. Abrezol’s success with other athletes, and placed four ofSwitzerland’s top skiers under his care. At the following winter Olympicsheld in Grenoble, France, three of Abrezol’s four proteges won medals. Atthe Sapporo games in Japan, the Swiss team dominated the competition.Since then, Dr. Abrezol has worked with many athletes in various disci-plines, with equally positive results. Athletes who use dynamic relaxationare generally in better physical shape, and are better able to handle the in-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 61credible stress that goes hand in hand with competitive sport. Result? Theywin more often.To train skiers, for example, Dr. Abrezol prescribed a rapid series of stageone dynamic relaxation exercises. First, subjects repeat a positive formula-tion: “I am confident. I am full of energy. I am concentrated. I am not ner-vous. I’m not scared. I want to get out there and win!”They then imagine a perfect performance, visualizing themselves as theycomplete a perfect run down the course. Not concentrating long enough toreach the finish line, or becoming distracted for any reason, is considered theequivalent of a fall - the subject has to start all over again.Then, with subjects in a sophronic state, Dr. Abrezol would lead themthrough the following exercises:1.Head rotations, six to the left, six to the right. Imagine yourself holdinga flashlight between your teeth, tracing circles with the beam of light.2.Fifteen neck muscle contractions: subjects grimace like characters in ahorror movie, pulling the mouth in all directions, bulging neck muscles andfolding facial skin.3.Three sets of rapid abdominal breathing exercises (subjects should stopif pain is felt in the kidney region).4.Complete exhalation, full inhalation through the mouth, breath reten-tion while pumping the shoulders, forced exhalation through the nose. Threesets.5.Complete exhalation, full inhalation through the mouth, breath reten-tion while jumping in place, forced exhalation through the nose.

Orientals are familiar with the ‘specialpowers’ demonstrated by yogis at various stages in their training, regardingthem as signs of progress.As far as we know, however, no attempts have been made to use dy-namic relaxation to develop paranormal faculties here in the west. Dr. Abrezolhas conducted parapsychological experiments on subjects trained in dynamicrelaxation, but their training program was not conceived for that purpose. Inour opinion, there is an enormous potential for adapting dynamic relaxationexercises for such purposes.The Future Of SophrologyThe description of sophrological techniques provided so far may havegiven readers the impression that helping subjects attain an altered state ofconsciousness is easy. Unfortunately, that is not the case.The key factor is the sophrologist’s attitude - if he or she lacks convictionor doubts his abilities, the climate of confidence between therapist and sub-ject, which is crucial to the success of any treatment, is undermined."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"SophrologyPage 63You may be surprised to learn that there are no laws prohibiting anyonefrom hypnotizing or practicing sophrology on anyone else. On the other hand,unexpected things can and do happen. Amateur hypnotists or sophrologistsmay find themselves in situations they can’t handle. They may even panic.All suggestions, all instructions given to subjects in an altered state, have atremendous impact. Sometimes results are obtained that seem to indicatesuccess, but turn out to be superficial solutions to some deeper problem which,because it is ignored, may leave patients worse off than before.For that reason, we must emphasize that the utmost care is required whenputting these techniques into practice. Whenever sophrology is used to treatmedical problems, a doctor or qualified paramedic should be in charge.Caycedo was well aware of the importance of training qualified personnel,and personally offered regular training sessions to potential sophrologists.On the other hand, access to sophrology is not limited to a chosen few.For sophrology to be effective, it must be applied as a preventive measure aswell as a cure. Caycedo also organized seminars designed for the public atlarge, in which people were taught how to benefit from sophronic relaxationtechniques, and how to make sophrology a part of their day-to-day lives. Hetried to help people establish what he called ‘a psychological barrier againstdisease’ and labeled this aspect of his work ‘social sophrology.’The method seems to us to be an excellent way to combat many of the illsassociated with our modern, fast-paced urban lifestyle.

Such is not the case in our daily lives:subtle, sometimes clandestine means of persuasion are commonly used bybusinesses to advertise their products, by government for propaganda pur-poses, and even by educators, in order to manipulate students without theirknowledge.“People who are exposed to these influences are totally ignorant of thepsychological techniques being used on them - they think they can resist ad-vertising and propaganda, that they are free to form their own opinions, thatthey can detect when they are being manipulated, and that ideas have nopower over them.”To better understand how sophrological suggestion works, let’s take alook at how advertising can change our behavior. Psychological laws gov-erning the principles of advertising were formulated in the twentieth cen-tury, although many of the techniques had already been used for centuries.These laws helped advertisers influence potential buyers on both a rational,and irrational or intuitive level.You may think that if you want to sell a product all you have to do isexplain what it does. You could ask a few sincere people to list the reasonswhy they bought the product, and then expand those reasons into a commer-cial sales pitch.Well, you would be wrong."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 66Selling is a lot more complex than that.A classic example was reported by Ernst Dichter.

They were asked to test the detergents and commenton which was best for delicate washing. Of course, all three boxes containedthe same detergent.A majority of women responded that the detergent in the blue box wastoo strong, that in some cases it damaged clothes. They said the yellow-boxdetergent was not as effective, leaving stains on some clothes. The third box -the one with both colors - was the best by far. Women said it was “marvel-ous” or “extraordinary” for cleaning delicate laundry.People act for two kinds of reasons:• Logical, rational reasons (originating in the neo-cortex);• emotional, seemingly irrational reasons.Under hypnosis, an idea or suggestion can be planted directly into asubject’s subconscious mind. Subjects can even be told not to act on the sug-gestion until some later point in time (this is called posthypnotic suggestion).For example, you could tell a subject to turn off all the lights in the roomthirty minutes after he is awakened. Five minutes before the appointed time,the subject will start complaining of a headache, or say that the bright lightsare hurting his eyes. He’ll then go and turn them all off.Interestingly enough, the subject has to find a rational reason for doingsomething irrational, in this case an action that was planted in his subcon-scious mind by the hypnotist.To summarize:"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 671. The real motivation for our behavior often has nothing to do with the reasonswe think are behind our actions, as demonstrated by the women comparingdetergents, or the hypnotized subject closing all the lights.2. These underlying motivations usually originate in the most primitive part of ourbrain.3. Why we do things can be inf-luenced through the power of suggestion.States of consciousnessIdeally, publicists would place target populations in a state of hypnosisin order to ensure that suggested modes of behavior become engraved intheir minds, without being blocked by the rational neo-cortex. This is moreor less what happens to people who shop in large department stores, super-markets or malls - soothing musak, the vast array of merchandise to choosefrom, subliminal odors, free samples, etc., are all designed to make shopperslose their sense of time, and spend more than they may have intended whenthey walked in.The type of mild concentration required to watch TV also places viewersin a state that is very close to hypnosis. Driving a car on the highway canhave the same effect: the purring of the engine, the comfortable seats, themonotony of the passing scenery, combine to place you in a state of mind thatis very receptive to suggestion. Advertisers take full advantage of the situa-tion, transmitting powerful suggestive messages on billboards, bus and truckpanels, car radios, etc.As people unconsciously slip into a kind of collective trance, the marketpotential for all kinds of products grows larger and larger. Companies hireand train sales people by the thousands, using the very same advertisingmethods to convince their own personnel that the products they representare excellent, and deserve to be sold. In many cases sales people are not sim-ply dupes of the system - they are aware that they are being programmed,but allow themselves to be conditioned, knowing that the best way to sell aproduct is to believe in its merits."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 68Hitler and his advisors mastered the techniques of mass hypnosis per-fectly - the huge rallies, with their massive decor and music, as well as themonotonous tone of his speeches, have become models of government pro-paganda.In short then, both advertising and propaganda try to induce a semi-hyp-notic state in target populations, enabling the suggestions that are made tobypass the critical, conscious part of the mind.SuggestionSuggestions are planted in people’s minds with the help of images (theterm ‘image’ is here used to include auditory, tactile, olfactory and gustatory,as well as visual images).We are bombarded with visual images through various media: TV, mov-ies, magazines, window displays, brochures, billboards, and so on. Since psy-choanalysis discovered that our subconscious mind thinks in terms of sym-bols as well as images, symbols have become an important vehicle for trans-mitting suggestions: a photograph of a man’s hand holding a box of deter-gent is retouched to accentuate the hairs growing on the back of the hand.Why? In order to enhance its virile symbolism and suggest that the detergentis more powerful.It is more difficult to alter olfactory, tactile and gustatory images in thisway, since they usually take the form of free samples of a given product.Auditory images, on the other hand, are easily enhanced. Sound effectslike the click of a seat belt being fastened, or the glug-glug of wine beingpoured from a bottle, are powerful suggestions, but the most powerful of allauditory images is language itself.Animals possess five senses and their mental representations, constitut-ing what Pavlov called the ‘primary signaling system.’ Man, because of hissuperior cerebral potential, developed a second signaling system, connectedto the first, which greatly facilitates the transmission, manipulation, compila-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 69tion, association and abstraction of cerebral images. This second system islanguage. People can directly transmit their own cerebral images to others,through the power of words and their influence on the mind. It is this samepower, called terpnos logos, that sophrologists use to create new associationsor unblock inhibited mental processes.Various factors are used to reinforce the power of a suggestion:SecurityIn order to appease and reassure our logical minds, advertisers often of-fer arguments that are designed to make potential buyers feel secure about agiven product: its longstanding track record (established in 1874); its use bywell-known personalities; its official recognition (winner of the — prize, ap-proved by the FDA, etc); the brand name itself, which is often formulated toinspire confidence (pure Colombian coffee, Century 21, etc.).RelaxationThe body and mind are in constant interaction. A tense mind is translatedinto nervous tension and muscular contractions. If the mind is to be recep-tive, the body must be relaxed. North African carpet vendors have been awareof this fact for centuries - clients are comfortably seated and offered a cup ofmint tea before wares are exhibited. Friendly sales persons who smile a lotput buyers at ease. The same technique is used in TV and print ads, whererestful images appearing before the actual sales message are designed to helpcustomers relax.ConcentrationOnce our attention is attracted by any aspect of an ad, other elements canbe added, since the mind continues storing information unconsciously. In theexample of the detergent being held by a manly hand, the symbolism, al-though not perceived on a conscious level, still has an impact. Subliminaladvertising, discovered in 1965, transmits messages which are received on alevel below that of ordinary consciousness. Superimposed images pass by so"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 70quickly that the conscious mind does not have time to perceive them. Never-theless, they are perceived - tests have clearly shown that consumer behavioris influenced by these subliminal suggestions. The practice is now illegal, butthe mechanism is still in place, occurring whenever you concentrate on agiven object, but continue to register periphery information (for example whilestaring at a computer screen).RepetitionNapoleon once said, ‘repetition is the best part of rhetoric.’ Fortunately,when we are in a waking state a simple suggestion is not enough to modifyour mental structures, and in turn our behavior. Repetition reinforces an ini-tial suggestion and compensates for the weakness of the original signal. Ifrepeated often enough, a new cerebral pathway is formed.Some brand names have been repeated so often they have become part ofour everyday vocabulary (every advertiser’s dream!); Kleenex, Frigidaire,Nike, Bic, etc., were all unknown brand names at one time. Through repeti-tion, they have become synonymous with the products they represent. Theexact same process is at work during our education and conditioning as chil-dren - frequent exhortations to ‘be careful!’ or ‘don’t touch!’ become so deeplyengrained in our minds we cease to question their validity.Emotional stateIntense emotion, whether it be fear or joy, can rapidly create a new modelof behavior when associated with a suggestion. Television advertising ex-ploits the phenomenon by associating products with memorable events (thebirth of a child, marriage, graduation, etc.).Suggestion through exampleA suggestion becomes much stronger when people can identify with theperson or group making it. Non-verbal communication (smiling faces ofpeople who have used a given product) is often used to provide an addeddimension to the message."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 71Examples are one of the strongest forms of suggestion in existence. If, onthe other hand, the person or group making the suggestion acts differentlythan intended, the suggestion will be severely weakened, or even neutral-ized. The power of setting an example goes all the way back to childhood,when our parents acted as models for our developing behavior.FaithThe greater the faith or confidence we place in a person or object, themore susceptible we become to suggestion. Faith can move mountains, as thesaying goes. It can also place people in a state of semi-trance, making them soenthusiastic their normal cerebral functions become inhibited. This is whathappens when someone who is ordinarily shy and uncommunicative becomestransformed by his or her belief in a cause into an eloquent orator, capable ofstirring up the masses through the power of images and words.These are just a few examples of the ways in which suggestion influencesour daily lives.How are such suggestions transformed into acts?Suggestion is a form of cerebral conditioning, but between the sugges-tion and the act it implies lie a whole series of complex processes. A researchernamed Bernheim was the first to discover what he called ‘ideo-dynamics’ -the theory that all suggestions tend to result in actions, as the subconsciousautomatically attempts to induce us to act on what it perceives.Driving a car along the highway, lost in thought, you may suddenly real-ize you’re approaching your exit. It’s as if you were driving on automaticpilot. The same type of thing happens when you are trying to solve a prob-lem - unable to find a solution, you concentrate on something else, whensuddenly you’re hit with an inspiration, as if the mental process had contin-ued on a subconscious level, and guided you to the answer you were seek-ing."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 72We’ll be taking a closer look at ideo-dynamics later on.Research on hypnosis, and later on psychology and psychoanalysis, hasenabled us to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of suggestion. Inthe same way that sophrologists are sometimes able to affect miraculous curesusing terpnos logos, other disciplines have been using various techniques toachieve the same result. All however, are based on the principles of sugges-tion we have just outlined.How Miracles HappenLet’s start with the Catholic Church, as personified by Jesus and hisapostles, and the saints. Overwhelming evangelical testimony through thecenturies claims that ... ‘the blind were made to see, the deaf to hear, thecrippled to walk, the lepers to be healed, and even the dead to be broughtback to life.’Saints are still performing miracles as we approach the end of the twenti-eth century, in various locations like Lourdes Cathedral in France. What seemsto characterize most miracles is the fact that they occur instantly. There isnothing mysterious about curing psychologically induced functional disor-ders over time - suggestions planted in the mind, perhaps enhanced by somedegree of trance and a dose of faith, gradually take effect and resolve theproblem. The instant cures of organic disorders attributed to miracles, how-ever, remain mysterious.Professor Robert Tocquet of the Paris School of Anthropology, and a dis-tinguished parapsychologist, offers the following hypothesis:We know that the ability to regenerate organs exists in some animals. Thehigher we get on the evolutionary ladder, the more this ability is diminished.In man it has more or less disappeared. Invertebrates have astonishing pow-ers of regeneration. Cut a sponge into tiny pieces and each piece will recon-stitute itself entirely. The same is true of worms - when cut into segments,each part become a whole worm. Starfish, a little higher up the ladder, areable to contract themselves when afraid by expelling most of their internal"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 73organs, which they then regenerate when the source of danger has passed.Fish are able to redintegrate (the process of regenerating limbs or organs)some amputated body parts, including fins, jaws and sexual organs. Sala-manders can redintegrate eyes, legs and tail (as can some other lizards).Under normal conditions, this regenerative ability is absent in humans.But does that mean that it does not exist? Professor Tocquet believes that itdoes exist, in a latent state, in all people. As we said earlier, man evolved bysuperimposing a new part of the brain (the neo-cortex) over its more primi-tive part, at the same time refining and re-organizing its functions.It seems that the function of redintegration, generally no longer appar-ent, can be reawakened under certain conditions. There are two ways thiscan happen:• either a person stimulates his or her own latent faculties of redintegration be-cause of a psychological, emotional, or physiological shock (like sudden immer-sion in cold water, as is the custom at Lourdes);• or a second party, gifted with paranormal faculties, stimulates the latent pro-cess.Professor Tocquet then calculated the rate at which cells must divide inorder to regenerate an organ or cure a physical problem almost instanta-neously, determining it to be fifteen to thirty times more rapid than normal,which remains within the realm of acceptable limits. His conclusion:“Under these conditions, the almost instantaneous regeneration of tis-sues observed in so-called miraculous cures does not seem to be incompat-ible with normal cellular division. The metaphysical factor, the existence ofwhich we are postulating here, must in some way accelerate the process to arate that is not beyond reasonable limits. In addition, paranormal factors notonly stimulate and accelerate cellular division, but also organize these divi-sions according to strict anatomical principles, so that a specific organ or otherbodily part is reconstructed.”"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 74As we’ll see a little later on, the Russian discovery of bioplasm reinforcesthis theory.In most cases then, some type of suggestion is responsible for effectingpsychosomatic cures, whether they can be explained or are deemed miracu-lous. The ancient kings of France, who were believed to rule by divine right,were reportedly able to cure cases of scrofula, characterized by tubercular,purulent abscesses on the skin, by touching affected persons. On specific holydays, following rituals of solemn prayer, they would walk through the streetsand perform a laying on of hands that could cure thousands of people at atime. This power was lost during the reign of Louis XVI. Charles X tried torevive it, but in vain - by that time doubt in the institution of divine right hadbecome too strong to overcome.A demonic spectacleThe Jansenist movement in France had been condemned on a number ofoccasions by the time Deacon François of Paris, a fervent Jansenist and ex-tremely popular man of the cloth, died on May 1, 1727. His followers prayedat the deceased deacon’s tomb, hoping for a miracle that would incite theChurch to admit the error of its ways and cease its unjust persecution of theJansenist movement.A pauper named Léro, suffering from bleeding ulcers on his left leg whichdoctors had been unable to cure, spent nine days at the deacon’s tomb, pray-ing for a miracle. On the ninth day he rose up, completely cured.The news spread quickly, and soon a huge crowd had gathered aroundthe tomb, made up of people suffering from all sorts of ailments. Over thenext five years, thousands of miraculous cures were reported to have takenplace in the cemetery where the deacon lay buried. The scene must have re-sembled Dante’s inferno - imagine one of Mesmer’s group sessions, withpeople going into convulsions, creating an atmosphere akin to mass hysteria,with the added element of torture being administered as penance - beating,burning, stoning, whipping, etc. Strangely enough, in many cases flagella-"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 75tion and other forms of torture actually seemed to improve a patient’s condi-tion. By modern standards, of course, the spectacle seems sickening.The Church, worried about a possible revolt, demanded that King LouisXV put an end to the demonic demonstrations. The king, horrified by ac-counts of mass hysteria, grotesque convulsions and other bizarre occurrences,closed the cemetery on January 29, 1732.The people responded by posting a notice on the cemetery gates: As KingLouis decreed, God take heed, miracles no more, beyond this door.Faith HealersMany of the same elements we mentioned in our discussion of advertis-ing were at work in places like Lourdes and the Saint Médard cemetery wheredeacon François lay buried: encouraging faith and confidence, inducing asemi-trance like state, inciting sudden violent emotions, establishing recog-nition by, or identification with, well-known personalities, and so on.The art of faith healing continues to this day. In countries like France, youare more likely to encounter a country healer than a shaman dancing to thebeat of drums, although the country healer may seem just as strange, repeat-ing mystic rituals that have been handed down for centuries, accompaniedby gestures, incantations, magic formulas, potions, ointments, talismans andthe like.In the Eye Of The Sorcerer, a report on sorcery in France by two journalists,P. Alfonsi and P. Pesnot, examples are given of magic formulas used by heal-ers to cure the sick:“ APHONIDA + MALTHEURS + URAT + PUATIA + CONDISA+FONDEN + ORTOO + NOXIO + APENIS + BOURGASIS + GLAY + VENIASERCHANI.“Feel the presence of the Lord and the Blessed Virgin. Holy Saint Johnhas joined them. God says to Saint John: Sit down. I cannot, replies SaintJohn, my eyes are too painful. Sit down, says God, and I will cure your eyes."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 76With this white veil I bind you. With this red veil I caress you. With this blackveil I cure you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.”Hemorrhaging was stopped with the following incantation: “De latereejus exivit sanguis et aqua.”“For sprains and broken limbs repeat: May God, our blessed Saint Anneand the holy Saints Cosmos and Damien heal these bones, nerves, and joints...”The prayers were chanted as the healer made the sign of the cross, andtouched or breathed on the injured part of the body.When analyzed, it was found that the potions, ointments and plants pre-scribed by such faith healers did sometimes contain active ingredients thatmight have had a beneficial effect. Modern healers, however, tend to use con-coctions with absolutely no medical benefits, often composed of flour, lac-tose, chalk, talc, distilled water and bitter tasting syrup. Nevertheless thesesubstances can have an extraordinary effect, due no doubt to the power ofsuggestion, and to the faith patients place in the healer. The medical term forthis is the placebo effect, which we’ll be talking more about later on.Talismans, medallions, holy images and symbols, crystals, precious stones,etc. were supposed to have more of a preventive than a curative effect, andoften yielded results that were quite spectacular. The bearers of talismanswould frequently be lacking confidence in their own intellectual and/or physi-cal abilities. If their faith was strong enough, they could draw strength fromthe talisman, improve their condition, and attribute the change to divine in-tervention. It was as if the symbol removed inhibitions and released latenttalents and strengths.In the process of healing through suggestion, the power attributed to thehealer already exists in a latent state in the patient. All the healer does is actas a catalyst, releasing the self healing mechanism. Suggestion is not the onlymeans of achieving this - certain paranormal faculties can also have the sameeffect, as we’ll see in the last part of this book."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 77In this century, one of the most celebrated healers in Europe discoveredhis talent almost by accident. Colonel Olcott was a student of the famousmedium Madame Blavatsky. Olcott met a man named Cornelius Appu, suf-fering from paralysis in one arm, and partial paralysis in a leg. Olcott de-cided to try and help the man by performing a few magnetic passes, aftersuggesting that the technique could help. The treatment seemed to have noimmediate effect, but the man returned the next day saying he felt a littlebetter. He wanted another treatment. Colonel Olcott was surprised, but agreedto try again. In a few days his patient had regained full use of his limbs. Appureported the incident to the local newspaper, which ran a story about the‘miracle cure,’ claiming that Colonel Olcott was an extraordinary healer.People started showing up at his door, either because they were curiousor because they were seeking help. Olcott cured one person, then anotherand another. His reputation spread like wildfire, and he soon found himselfinundated with requests for help from the four corners of the globe.After his own initial surprise and skepticism had passed, Olcott acceptedwhat seemed to be an undeniable fact: either because of his notoriety, or be-cause of the confidence he inspired in people, he really was able to cure thesick. It was as if the faith people placed in him had reinforced his own talentas a healer.In modern times, a new breed of faith healers has appeared, notably inthe Philippines. Charter companies are booked solid, flying people to grouphealing sessions, rituals that usually include prodigious amounts of bloodand organs, both of which act as visual suggestions, reinforcing the faith ofsubjects. Here is a report by the wife of a Latin American diplomat who wentto Manila for a firsthand look at these so-called miracle workers:“Suggestion is their main tool. They know that for patients to believe intheir power, they have to spread a lot of blood around, creating the impres-sion that they are literally tearing the disease out of a patient’s body. It is thepatients themselves who beg to be operated on. When a healer refuses forone reason or another, they are greatly disappointed."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 78If their demand for help is accepted, they are all the more apt to believethe intervention will work. Based on what I saw with my own eyes, there isno fraud involved. The whole thing is staged to stimulate patients’ own psy-chological powers of self healing.” (Olivier Jourdan, Paris Match Magazine,No. 1309).Spirit healersThis type of healer enters a trance state during which he or she is ‘pos-sessed’ by the spirit of another, usually a deceased doctor. The healer thenoperates on the patient’s ‘subtle body,’ a kind of energy body that mirrors thephysical body. Once the operation is complete, beneficial effects are supposedto be transferred to the patient’s physical body.One of this century’s most renowned healers from the ‘world beyond,’Doctor Lang, could be summoned by a certain George Chapman, a firemanby profession. His list of cures was impressive, to say the least. Many mem-bers of the medical profession did not hesitate to refer their patients to himwhen conventional medical interventions failed. As one doctor said, “I be-lieve that spirit healing does truly exist. The only problem is explaining howit works.”The power of suggestion can be just as effective in a negative sense -many people, believing they were afflicted with the plague, developed allthe symptoms of the disease, although post-mortem examinations showedthat the only way they could have been affected was psychologically. Anydoctor knows that telling patients they have nothing to worry about, that ahealth problem is minor and will soon disappear, will accelerate the healingprocess, while saying something like, “I’m afraid your condition is serious,there isn’t much we can do for you...” will probably make patients even moreill than they already are.Can the cures produced by Chapman and other spirit healers be attrib-uted solely to the power of suggestion? The list of health problems success-fully treated in this manner is astonishing: ulcers, cancer, blindness, schizo-"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 79phrenia, polio, etc. Sometimes patients even develop scars where ‘subtle body’operations were supposed to have been carried out.Spirit healers abound in Brazil, a country that has inherited the cult tradi-tions of its African and Indian populations. José Arigo, who died in 1973, wasreported to have performed operations with a kitchen knife, without leavingany scars whatsoever. At present, a woman called Isaltina is the reigning queenof spirit healers. Her inspiration is a certain Doctor Artz Scovsk, a Germanphysician. Isaltina’s reputation generated so much controversy that a Brazil-ian TV station decided to try and produce a live broadcast of her sessions.Isaltina accepted, knowing full well that if she failed she would destroy anyconfidence people had in spirit healing, as well as her own reputation. TheTV journalists were allowed to choose the patient, and the whole procedurewas to be witnessed by seven doctors.On the night of the broadcast every TV in Rio was turned on. Stores stayedopen late, restaurants and bars with television sets were packed with cus-tomers. In poorer districts, neighbors crowded into homes where a TV wasavailable. Isaltina was introduced, and said a few words to her spectators.Then the patient was wheeled in a wheelchair. He was a well known person-ality, a doctor and former Secretary of State. Both his legs had been paralyzedfor years.After exchanging a few words with the man in order to gain his confi-dence, Isaltina told him to relax, and then placed him in a trance. She made afew passes over his torso and legs, under the skeptical scrutiny of the sevendoctors present.After some minutes she said, “It is done.”The camera zoomed in on the patient. He sat up, appearing to be still halfasleep. Slowly he placed one foot on the floor, then the other. Then, before theastonished eyes of millions of viewers, he stood up, walked over to Isaltinaand embraced her.The extraordinary Edgar Cayce"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 80Perhaps the most extraordinary case of paranormal healing ever recordedconcerned the amazing Edgar Cayce.In October, 1910, the Times of London ran the following headline: ILLIT-ERATE BECOME GREAT PHYSICIAN UNDER HYPNOSIS. The strangepowers exhibited by Edgar Cayce rocked the very foundations of the medi-cal world. Cayce, who did not need to be possessed by a deceased doctor inorder to cure people, seemed to have inherited the paranormal faculties ofthe Marquis de Puységur who, in a state of hypnosis, was able to diagnosepatients’ health problems, and then prescribe appropriate remedies.His story was the subject of endless discussion, and rightly so, since thethirty thousand or so diagnoses made by Cayce were all carefully documented,authenticated and verified by trained physicians. Result: in over 80% of casesCayce’s diagnoses were correct, and the treatments he prescribed effective,even though they often defied any known laws of medicine.Having mastered the technique of self hypnosis, Cayce would simply liedown and take a few deep breaths. In just a moment or two his eyes wouldstart fluttering and his body would begin twitching, signaling the onset ofthe trance state. An assistant would recite the following instructions:“Now you are going to see Mr. —, born on —, living in —. You will per-form a complete and detailed examination of this person, and you will tellme what state he is in now, and give me the causes of any problems you find;you will also tell me what measures to take to alleviate his problem. Nowyou are going to answer the questions I have just asked.”Without being given any more information, Cayce would describe theperson, the place he or she lived, and his or her physical condition, alongwith his recommendations for a cure.Suggestion entered into Cayce’s work in two ways:• Firstly, the formula recited to him as he entered a state of hypnosis somehowtriggered his powers of clairvoyance;"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 81• Secondly, the prescriptions he offered to patients became doubly effective be-cause of the nature of their source, which acted like a powerful post-hypnoticsuggestion.Christian Science and SuggestionPhineas Parkhurst Quimbey, a watchmaker living in New Orleans in themid 1800’s, was well aware of the importance of suggestion. An avid practi-tioner of what was then still called magnetism (later referred to as hypnosis),Quimbey noticed something unusual: during diagnosis / prescription ses-sions, his subject seemed to prescribe remedies and treatments which, al-though often apparently inappropriate, seemed to be just as effective for cur-ing patients.On one such occasion, his hypnotized subject prescribed a medicationthat happened to be very expensive. When Quimbey told him that the womanbeing treated was poor, and asked him if it would be possible to prescribesomething that was within her means, the subject / therapist immediatelysuggested a remedy that, although much less costly, would have the com-pletely opposite effect of the original remedy.Quimbey could only deduce what he had long suspected was true: it wasa patient’s faith in the process of consultation, and in the power of the pre-scribed remedy - and not the remedy itself - that was responsible for the cure.He decided to abandon what he called ‘the subterfuge of magnetism’and instead developed a quasi-religious, quasi-philosophical system whichwould guarantee the health of its followers. He called it Christian Science, orthe science of health.Mrs. Mary-Baker Eddy was one of Quimbey’s patients. She was a ner-vous woman, hot-tempered, highly emotional, uncompromising in her mor-als to the point of being neurotic, and a passionate believer in spiritualism.She also happened to be bedridden, suffering from paralysis.After being cured by Phineas Quimbey’s new doctrine, she became itsmost fervent disciple, devouring everything Quimbey had written on the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 82subject. Quimbey himself died a short time later, and Mrs. Baker-Eddy tookover the reins of the fledgling movement.Here’s what Mark Twain had to say about her character: “She was bornwith the mind of a businessman, and a great appetite for power. If she founda job as a chef’s assistant in a hotel, there is no doubt in my mind that in twoyears she would own all the hotels in the city, and in twenty years, all thehotels in America. She is the driving force behind the huge fortune amassedby the Christian Science movement.”In half a century, Mrs. Baker-Eddy built a vast occult empire, based on astrictly hierarchical system of management and efficient organization. Atpresent the movement has attracted over two million followers around theworld. Members must pay to take courses, pay to be treated, pay to attendceremonies. If and when they finally graduate as accredited Christian Sci-ence healers, they have to pay a monthly fee to retain their license to practice.The ideological basis of the movement can be summed up as follows:Man, being an emanation of God, is spiritual and eternal. Man never was,and never will be, a material entity. Pain, suffering and disease are all imag-ined, caused by mistaken beliefs. Restore truth in the minds of patients, andthey will be cured.Although we do not espouse this doctrine, it must be admitted that it hascertain benefits:• Instead of raising children to fear sickness and suffering (and thereby turningthem into anguished adults), Christian Science teaches children that they arebasically healthy. This seems to actually strengthen their resistance to disease,at least on a psychological level.• If official testimonials and documented reports can be believed, Christian Sci-ence is responsible for thousands of ‘miraculous’ cures of all kinds, rangingfrom fractured bones to cancer tumors to mental disorders, effected either bypatients themselves, or with the help of a qualified Christian Science healer."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 83• The movement’s positive philosophy seems to benefit believers: like a self-ful-filling prophecy, constant suggestions that followers have the right to health,wealth and happiness through faith in Christian Science actually produce re-sults.Unfortunately, like many doctrines, Christian Science is uncompromis-ing as far as its moral dictates and aberrations are concerned, and does nottolerate any resistance or skepticism: followers must place complete faith inthe biblical quotes and ‘keys’ revealed by Mrs. Baker-Eddy, and systemati-cally refuse any form of conventional medical treatment, even under circum-stances which are life-threatening.Coué : an attempt at synthesisEmile Coué, a member of the Nancy School mentioned earlier, eventu-ally developed his own method of suggestion, to be used on subjects in awaking state rather than under hypnosis. The Coué Method was derided bydetractors, who misunderstood its aproach. Coué himself was ridiculed - hewasn’t even a doctor, only a simple pharmacist. And yet, the method en-dured, and Coué’s name is inscribed in the annals of psychology for havingformulated the laws governing suggestion, described below.The Law of Inverse EffortIf you think, “I want such and such a thing to happen...” and your innermind says, “You want this to happen, but it won’t...” not only will you notget your wish, you’ll get the opposite of what you want.To illustrate the point, Coué used a story told by the great French scien-tist Pascal: Take a plank of wood thirty feet long and half a foot wide, put iton the ground and ask people to walk its length. Most people would nothave any trouble. Take the same plank, suspend it between two ten-storybuildings, and ask people to do the same thing. Chances are, no matter howmuch of a conscious effort they make, most people would fall, or be too afraidto try."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 84The same applies to people suffering from insomnia, for example. Thethought: “I’m going to have trouble falling asleep...” inevitably crosses theirmind as soon as they get into bed. The more of an effort they make - theharder they try to fall asleep - the more agitated they become. In fact, it isonly when they stop wanting to fall asleep that they are able to do so.Say there’s a word on the tip of your tongue - no matter how much of aneffort you make, you can’t recall what it is. But if you say something like,“It’ll come to me...” and then stop trying to remember, you’ll probably havea sudden flash a few minutes later and remember the word.Think about what happens if you say, “I’m going to give it a try...” Theword ‘try’ implies a possibility of failure. A suggestion formulated in thisway will have a negative effect because it is accompanied by doubt, and it isthe aspect of doubt that your subconscious mind will focus on. Result? Theopposite of what you want to happen will happen.The Law of Dominant EffectThis refers to the ideo-motor aspect of suggestion we talked about ear-lier: the conscious mind will rationalize ways to transform any idea acceptedby the subconscious mind into a reality. In addition, a stronger or dominantsuggestion will take precedence over a weaker one.Our behavior is characterized by the choices we are constantly having tomake. We cannot think two things at the same time, nor can we act in twodifferent ways at the same time. If you manage to convince a kleptomaniacthat he or she won’t steal anymore, then s/he won’t steal!Coué formulated the following laws concerning this aspect of sugges-tion:1. When the conscious and subconscious minds are in conflict, the subconsciousmind will always - without exception - prevail.2. When the conscious and subconscious minds are in conflict, the subconscious"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 85mind exerts a force that is in direct proportion to the square of the consciousmind (the mathematical term is an analogy which we hope will help readerscomprehend Coué’s approach).3. When the conscious and subconscious minds are in agreement, they do notwork together - each gains force from the other.4. The subconscious mind can be directed.AutosuggestionAt first Coué used suggestion in a very specific way: he would suggestthat such and such a symptom would disappear. Later he realized that mak-ing more general suggestions was just as effective - it was as if the subcon-scious took over the job of targeting specific problems. He finally came upwith the formulation that made him famous:“Day by day, in every way, I am feeling / getting better and better.”He told patients to repeat the formulation every day, during autosugges-tion sessions, claiming its effects would prove to be both preventive and cura-tive.What is autosuggestion? As far as Coué was concerned, all exterior sug-gestions are transformed into autosuggestions before being acted on, becauseonly then are they accepted by the subconscious.“We can define suggestion as ‘the action of grafting or imposing an ideaonto the brain of another person.’ But can we really do that? Strictly speak-ing, no. Exterior suggestions are useless in and of themselves: they will haveabsolutely no effect until the subject transforms them into autosuggestions.As for autosuggestion itself, we could define it as... “the implantation of anidea in one’s mind, by oneself.” You can suggest anything to another person:if that person’s subconscious does not accept it, if it is not digested and as-similated, so to speak, and transformed into an autosuggestion, no action orchange in behavior will be forthcoming.”"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 86This means that we can formulate and implant suggestions in our ownmind.In fact, that is exactly what we are doing all day long!We are all conditioned by the way we think. Buddha put it another way:“Everything we are is the result of thought: our present condition is based onthought, it is made of thought. If a person speaks or acts while under theinfluence of negative or harmful thoughts, pain and suffering will follow, assurely as a cartwheel follows the hooves of an ox.”To compensate for the many negative autosuggestions we make each day,Coué advised his patients to embark on a program of positive programming.Although he refused to use hypnosis per se, he did recommend that patientsrepeat their formulations under specific conditions:• just before falling asleep;• just after waking up;• while listening to the ticking of a clock or metronome.As you can see, these conditions, which were designed to help patientsbecome particularly receptive, resemble the relaxation techniques used insophrology.The trouble with “it”I once did a little test: I slipped a couple of Coué’s best known formula-tions, including “Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better...”and “It will pass...” in with some other papers. Without mentioning any-thing about their origin, I asked a semantics expert to analyze the languageand, if possible, improve its structure, in order to make the formulations moresuggestive and give them greater emotional impact."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 87He said there was nothing he could do to improve the formulations. Hewas especially impressed by Coué’s next to best known phrase, “It too willpass...” Here’s what he had to say about it:“According to Freud, the word ‘it’ represents the part of our subconsciousrelated to our most primitive impulses. We’re always talking about that partof ourselves, referring to it simply as ‘it:’ “Doctor, it hurts...” “It’s okay...” “Itmakes me so upset...” “I feel it’s doing me good...” etc.“In many instances, functional or organic disorders are caused by con-flicts between our conditioned conscious mind (restricted by taboos, tradi-tions, moral codes, etc.) and our subconscious impulses.“It too will pass...” is a suggestion that liberates the subconscious. The‘it’ part of ourselves is changing, along with the rest of the world - it canmake progress, instead of remaining stagnant and creating correspondingblockages in our body or conscious mind, which in turn result in physical ormental health problems.”I found the concept interesting, perhaps because I had just run into a littleproblem with the word ‘it’ myself. After a seminar I gave on developing para-normal faculties, I asked the participants to write a short evaluation of thecourse. The word it appeared so many times, in reference to so many aspectsof the course, that I had to ask a journalist friend of mine to rewrite the testi-monials in order to make them easier to understand.Here’s an example. Paul H. wrote: “It made me more aware of these kindsof phenomena... it helped me acquire greater self discipline, and more con-trol over my nervous system and my body in general... it provided a threadof meaning to my life that had been missing before.... It shows people whorely too much on logic and rationality that there are other dimensions to life.”The ‘it’ Paul was referring to could be described as... ‘the part of oursubconscious mind that controls paranormal faculties and is receptive to sug-gestion.’ With that in mind, his evaluation made much more sense."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 88To get back to Coué... his two best known formulations (Every day, in allways... and It will pass...) are like Vitamin C for the subconscious mind.They proved to be so effective that thousands of cures were attributed totheir effect. As Coué himself said, “The technique of autosuggestion is notmeant to replace medical treatment, but to reinforce it. Mental formulationsare designed to act as an aid both for patients and doctors.”Unfortunately, Coué himself was idolized by many of his patients, whoswore by his method and claimed that no other treatment was worthwhile.Magic and illusionWhen I was a teenager I discovered I had a passion for magic. As I prac-ticed my ‘tricks’ I learned three important things:- Firstly, the human mind is very fallible. All kinds of slight-of-hand move-ments are performed out in the open, right there for everyone to see. Themagician is nervous, fearing someone will detect the ruse. But no, everyone’sattention is distracted by a diversionary word or a gesture. Although specta-tors do see what is going on, their mind chooses not to analyze what it per-ceives.- Secondly, I observed how simple tricks could become transformed intoalmost legendary feats, simply by being recounted to others. There was noth-ing more satisfying than doing an easy trick, and then listening to people telltheir friends about it. It’s amazing how much information was added or leftout in these accounts - in most cases the trick, as it was described later, was sodifferent from the original it would have been impossible to perform, evenfor the most skilled magician!- The third thing I noticed is that people love to believe in mystery anddeception, even when finding a logical solution is simple. The last thing amagician should do is reveal how his tricks are performed to an audience.No matter how ingenious a trick is, people are always disappointed when"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 89they find out how it’s done, perhaps because they feel stupid for not havingfigured it out for themselves.The same applies to the use of terpnos logos in sophrology, and Coué’smethod of positive formulation. Both techniques are so simple, and yet theywork!Coué’s method can be considered a precursor of sophrology. The tech-niques are similar in many ways: Coué would speak very slowly, using asingle rhythmic tone, much like the monotone used in sophrology, when in-structing patients. He also told his students that when they made sugges-tions they should not act like someone ordering a patient to do something.Instead they should act like a friend, a guide, leading patients towards thepath to recovery. This is precisely the attitude adopted by sophrologists.There is an Emile Coué Institute in Paris where his method is still beingtaught, and where interested persons can obtain a recording of the completeseries of formulations, taped by Coué himself (for a transcript see Appendix2).The placebo effectIn 1949, the American pharmaceutical industry introduced a new type ofmedication - antihistamines - designed to combat allergies, asthma and, itwas thought, sinusitis and colds.The publicity went into full swing, announcing that science had finallyfound a miracle cure for the common cold. Consumers flocked to their localpharmacies to buy the product and, interestingly enough, results were re-ported to be excellent in most cases.The American army expressed an interest in the new drug, since a largenumber of soldiers tended to catch cold during rigorous training exercises.Because sick soldiers can’t just take a few days off to rest and recover, coldswould often degenerate into bronchitis and other types of respiratory disor-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 90ders. The army appointed a military doctor, Lieutenant Colonel Hoagland, toundertake a series of test before the order for the medication was actuallysigned.To ensure that the antihistamines were effective, Dr. Hoagland dividedhis subjects into three groups:• group #1 received no medication at all - colds were left to run their naturalcourse;• group #2 were given antihistamine tablets;• group #3 were given tablets that resembled the antihistamine tablets in everyway except one - they were made of lactose instead of medication (lactose is asugar found in milk, and has absolutely no pharmaceutical effect).Subject were told to report back in two days. When they did, Dr. Hoaglandwas amazed by what he found:• members of the first group, which had received no medication, continued tosuffer from cold symptoms;• 35% of the second group - those who were given antihistamines - showed nomore cold symptoms;• 35% of the third group, which had received a benign medication substitute, alsoshowed no more symptoms!Dr. Hoagland concluded that the only benefits antihistamines had werepsychological. Although the army did not place its order for the new medica-tion, Hoagland’s research generated a tremendous amount of controversyamong scientists, and a host of further experiments were carried out on whatcame to be known as the placebo effect.Although placebos look exactly like medications (tablets, capsules, sup-positories, syrup, etc.) they are composed of chemically inert substances like"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 91distilled water, flour, lactose, and so on. The important thing is that subjectsare not aware they are being given a substitute - they think it’s the real thing.Placebo is derived from the Latin word ‘placere’ which means to please.Doctors were already familiar with the term: instead of arguing with patientswho demanded some type of medication even though they didn’t need it, oreven though the medication would do them no good, doctors would simplyprescribe a harmless substance in order to ‘placate’ them.“It might not help, but it won’t do any harm...” was the way doctorslooked at it. After Hoagland’s discovery, however, doctors actually beganusing placebos as a therapeutic tool. Experiments showed that a placebo’sdegree of effectiveness depended to a great extent on the attitude of the doc-tor prescribing it, and on what the patient believed the supposed medicationwould accomplish. If a doctor said something like, “This is an excellent medi-cation, perfectly suited to your condition...” its effect would be much morepositive than if he said, “We don’t know much about this medication. Give ita try and see what happens.”Doctors Kissel and Barrucand reported an interesting experiment in whichthe same placebo was administered to two groups of patients suffering frombleeding ulcers. The first group was told by their consulting doctor that theplacebo was a sensational new medication. The second group was told by anurse (not a doctor) that the placebo was still in an experimental stage, andthat its effects were not fully known. After a period of one year, both groupswere examined. In the first group, 70% of patients had improved dramati-cally, while in the second group only 25% showed any improvement.Clearly the attitude of the person prescribing the medication has an enor-mous effect on whether it is effective or not. The same researchers then con-ducted a double blind study, in which neither the doctor nor the patientsknew whether the medication was real or not. The results were strange to saythe least - in some cases a placebo was actually more effective than a realmedication! Amphetamines, for example, which are designed to stimulatethe central nervous system, improved physical endurance by 88%, while aplacebo increased endurance by 132%! In 30% to 40% of cases, placebos were"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"SuggestionPage 92just as effective as real medications for curing various disorders. The remain-ing 60% to 70% of subjects were less sensitive to the placebo for various rea-sons. Some were even diagnosed as being neurotic, and reacted negatively.The placebo effect has even been used to replace surgery: placebo opera-tions (simple incisions without any real intervention) resulted in an equalnumber of recoveries for certain types of problems, with the positive or nega-tive attitude of the surgeon being a determining factor for success (anotherdetermining factor being the expectation of patients as to whether they wouldrecover or not).All this should give you some idea of how important suggestion is. Asthese and other studies show, even therapies that are seemingly based onconcrete factors (medications or operations) are impacted by the power ofsuggestion."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Part Two: The AlphaExperience"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 94Mind Control, Biofeedbackand Alpha Waves“In centuries to come, the west will produce its own form ofyoga.”Carl JungSilva Mind ControlThe headline of a large ad in the Herald Tribune caught my eye: An amaz-ing scientifically based system that liberates the powerful potential of your mind, anddevelops your concentration, memory, intuition and creativity.I was fascinated - it was like reading an exact description of what I wastrying to accomplish in my ‘alpha seminars’ on personal development, whichwere a synthesis of all the methods I had come across previously. Was thissome form of competition? I had to find out more.The following evening I found myself in a conference room of a down-town hotel. There were about fifty other people there. The host began bypointing to a large graphic.“The mind has many levels of consciousness, each characterized by aspecific type of brain wave. When our mind is focussed on exterior objects,when we are conscious of the world around us and of the passage of time, inother words when our five senses are in full operation, we emit what arecalled beta waves."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 95“When our mind is focussed inward, on spiritual or extra-sensorial mat-ters, and we forget about the ordinary passage of time, we emit alpha or thetawaves. And finally, when we are unconscious, our brain emits delta waves.”She mentioned a number of scientific and medical references to back upthe theory, and then explained that this course in ‘psycho-orientology’ devel-oped by José Silva, would teach us how to control our mind by regulating thetypes of brain waves we emit.I couldn’t help but think about an article I had recently read by a certainProfessor Gastaut, a specialist in electroencephalogram technology, who wasdisturbed by ... “... the explosion of mind control businesses, all telling Mr.And Mrs. John Doe to practice their alpha control and electronic yoga exer-cises in order to attain alpha mastery through an alpha dynamic method whichpromises to make them smarter and get rid of all kinds of bad habits, as wellas stimulate their powers of ESP so they can communicate with long lostloved ones.”He went on to defend the victims of these unscrupulous companies, claim-ing that... “... clients end up buying all kinds of overpriced and ineffectivegadgets which are supposed to stimulate alpha wave activity, or pay largesums of money to learn how to control their alpha rhythms without the helpof an apparatus, in courses offered by fly-by-night specialists without anyreal professional training. Gullible new-age enthusiasts generally pay noth-ing for an introductory lecture, usually held in some posh hotel, and thensign on for a week’s course, complete with a guaranteed alpha mastery di-ploma, often paying hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in ad-vance.” (From The World of Medicine, August 7, 1974 - a response to thisarticle, which appeared in Psychology Magazine, Vol. 59, is reprinted in Ap-pendix 3 of this book).I must say the professor sounded like a frustrated movie critic who hateshis job because he can’t get out there and make movies himself. Whenever Icome across a review like that, I make sure to go and see the movie - at leasthalf the time it turns out to be great!"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 96In any case, I decided to take the course and find out for myself what itwas all about.“On Sunday when the course is over,” the host was saying, “you’ll begiven the name and age of someone you don’t know. You’ll be able to de-scribe that person fully, and tune in to what he or she is feeling or thinking.”Everyone in the room was incredulous, except for me - I had alreadytaught the same method, based on a technique developed by Edgar Cayce,with great success...Well, it’s Sunday and the seminar is over. It was interesting and disap-pointing at the same time. Interesting because it gave me an opportunity topractice a lot of exercises, even though I was already familiar with many ofthem, and because I learned more about José Silva, a living legend for hisfollowers, the father of ten children, a tireless worker who, at the end of eachworking day, spent his time devouring anything he could find to read onsubjects like psychology, hypnosis, occult phenomena and so on, until hecouldn’t keep his eyes open.He even did experiments on self hypnosis and clairvoyance with his chil-dren and, probably because children are less skeptical and more in touchwith their intuition, came up with some amazing results.For one thing, they were able to ‘visualize’ people they had never metsimply by being told their name, and clearly describe how they looked andfelt at any given moment. Then, after conditioning them with currents ofpositive thought and explaining concepts like the power of prayer, Silva wouldsuggest that they cure their subjects by imagining they were their patients.The things the children were able to accomplish were surprising, to say theleast. For example, he asked one of his children to imagine a woman suffer-ing from a number of psychosomatic problems because of her solitude. Eyesclosed, the child then mimed the act of dipping some bread in a bowl of soup.When Silva asked what he was doing, the boy replied, “I’m putting her intoa bath of love.”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 97Another case concerned a woman with heart problems. After enteringthe alpha state, Silva’s daughter went through the motions of giving some-one a massage. In another room, Silva asked one of his sons to tune into thesame patient. “There’s something wrong with her heart,” the boy said. WhenSilva asked the boy if he could help her he said, “Someone’s already helpingher.”On another occasion Silva asked his daughter to create an imaginary per-son who could give her advice and help with the experiments.“Ask what his name is,” Silva said.“His name is Thomas, but he says you can call him Tom.”“And what does he think about my idea of inventing him?”“He wants to know what makes you think it was your idea?” the girlreplied.After winning a large sum of money in a lottery, Silva decided to use thefunds to set up an organization that would develop and promote a methodbased on his personal experiences. He called it the Silva Mind Control Method.“These exercises are a fascinating collection of classical techniques, in-cluding self hypnosis, visualization, sensory awakening, and so on, with theadded element of a system of symbolism developed by Silva himself. Themethod seems to me to be an authentic and valuable contribution to the meth-odology of consciousness expansion.”Judging by the success of Silva’s Mind Control and Psycho-Orientationseminars, the method does provide excellent results. Since 1970, over 300,000people have taken his course, and the Psycho-Orientation Institute now hasover 250 trained instructors in the United States alone."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 98Some instructors, after being trained by Silva, have set up organizationsof their own, resulting in a phenomenal increase in the number of centersoffering course on things like alpha dynamics, mind dynamics, and so on.Silva’s Mind Control method has also been vehemently attacked by anumber of scientists, including Professor Gastaut, mentioned earlier. As faras I can see, it is Silva’s pragmatic approach, which can be summed up as ‘ifit works, use it!’ that seems to bother persons whose minds have been trainedto think only along scientific lines.In fact, certain aspects of Silva’s teaching are extremely difficult to ac-cept, and do much to discredit the method as a whole. Take the followingstatement, for example: ‘Visualize yourself winning a lottery, and you willwin.’This is a gross oversimplification of the mechanism of suggestion which,although it may be effective, still has its limits. In terms of methodology, Silva’spsycho-orientation seems to be more of a collection of existing techniques,rather than a synthesis of these techniques into something new and different.Some are difficult to take seriously, while others are embellished with unnec-essary esoteric rhetoric. In addition, the kind of unquestioning acceptancedemanded of followers is troubling to anyone who tends to think in rationalterms.On the other hand, Silva’s method does seem to appeal to the NorthAmerican mindset, which appreciates simplicity and pragmatism. The emo-tional testimony of thousands of men and women have helped confirm Silva’stheory of the existence of some kind of divine presence which defies rationalexplanation, and which far exceeds the powers of the rational mind.Here are a few examples of the kind of formulations students are told torepeat:• I will develop my mental faculties in order to better serve humanity.• The only difference between a genius and an ordinary person is that a genius"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 99uses a larger part of his / her brain for some special purpose. Now I too amcapable of using more of my brain potential for any purpose I choose.• I will never allow my mind or body to develop a disease like ... (specify thedisease).• Etc.People who have taken the course maintain a pragmatic attitude towardsthese kinds of suggestions. “It doesn’t matter what you say, as long as itworks.”In her book The Brain Revolution, Marilyn Ferguson, a scientific journalist,writes: “The sincere, but perhaps overly critical reaction of many members ofthe scientific community concerning Mr. Silva’s Mind Control method are, inmy opinion, exaggerated. Millions of people who never thought to devote amoment of their time to introspection suddenly discover a need to expandtheir consciousness, to find inner peace, to establish better, more open rela-tions with their friends and family, to learn how to develop self-control, andso on. After completing the course, many report an improvement in theirhealth, more energy, improved memory, etc. Others may lose weight, stopsmoking or drinking, or overcome a drug problem.”The great advantage of Silva’s method is that it has managed to include anumber of widely differing techniques into a single system. Towards the endof the course, students are taught how to develop their faculties of ESP inorder to give them firsthand experience of just how powerful their mind canbe, sometimes with surprising results.Based on experiments Silva conducted with his own children, the MindControl method uses a kind of mental laboratory in which to demonstratepowers of ESP. Two assistants are present, their role being to represent theparts of ourselves which we do not normally express. The process is designedto allow our subconscious mind to transmit information that we would usu-ally censure or block out completely. It is a rather ingenious way to teachpeople to receive and transmit messages to that part of themselves which"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 100they are not aware of (we’ll be taking a closer look at some of these mentaltechniques in the last part of this book).What seems to exasperate scientists the most is Silva’s constant referencesto the different types of brain waves (alpha, beta, theta and delta) and hisinsistence that students must learn to control their brain frequencies (with orwithout the help of some kind of device) in order to reach a special state ofinteriorization. Detractors claim this is simply a way to get people to investin devices or courses that do not have any scientific basis, and therefore can-not be effective.What is bio-feedback?Feedback is a term used by learning theory psychologists to signify ‘in-formation received in response to a given behavior.’ A good example can betaken from archery: the initial action, aiming and releasing the arrow, is fol-lowed by its feedback - the hole made by the arrow in the target. If the arrowis too far to the left, we adjust our initial behavior (aiming and releasing)more to the right.In very simple terms, we could say that people act for two reasons:• in order to avoid what is painful;• in order to seek what is pleasurable.Pain and pleasure are both basic forms of bio-feedback. A child who burnshimself playing with matches will learn, through the feedback of pain, thatmatches can be dangerous.Behavior can be modified by positive reinforcement, which is the equiva-lent of pleasurable feedback, or negative reinforcement, the equivalent of pain,failure, loss, etc."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 101Western society is based on this principle, from the spankings and re-wards children receive to the prison sentences and awards handed out toadults, depending on how they behave.Bio-feedback relies on a mechanism of biological information, and isfounded on the following theory:Certain types of physiological processes, which are ordinarily outsidethe sphere of conscious control, can gradually be mastered if they are trans-formed into visual or auditory signals. Breathing does not need to be rein-forced by a visual or auditory signal because we can control it simply byconcentrating and making an effort to do so. Brain waves, or the degree ofcontraction of our muscles, on the other hand, are normally imperceptible,and need to be reinforced.In 1968, J. Kamya, a psychiatrist at the University of Chicago, decided totry and get subjects to recognize a particularly interesting type of brain wave- alpha waves.“I wondered if, after repeated sessions in which subjects learned to de-tect this type of wave, they could not be taught to enter some special state ofawareness.”To his great surprise, not only were subjects able to recognize differenttypes of brain waves with ease, they could also voluntarily switch from onetype of wave to another. The process was greatly facilitated by using a devicethat emitted a beep when the desired frequency of brain wave appeared.Kamya called the process bio-feedback. The technique was soon beingused to treat a wide range of disorders, sometimes with astonishing success,shedding new light on the concept of what is voluntary and involuntary, asfar as processes taking place within the human organism are concerned. Itspotential applications are so varied that we are still discovering new ways touse it, from curing certain nervous behaviors like involuntary twitching toteaching patients how to control epilepsy, blood pressure, digestive activity,and so on."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 103However, since Kamya’s first article on bio-feedback appeared in Psy-chology Today in 1968, it has been the use of bio-feedback techniques to con-trol brain wave frequency, and especially to stimulate the emission of alphawaves, that has generated the most controversy.Brain waves, telepathy and EEGIn 1924 a German psychiatrist, Hans Berger, author of a book on tele-pathic phenomena, decided to develop his theory of differing brain waves,which he firmly believed in after performing various experiments on paran-ormal phenomena. He measured the electrical impulses emitted by an acci-dent victim whose skull had been partly removed. His work showed thatbrain cell activity, far from being random, was organized into distinct pat-terns, in the form of waves. The first type of wave to be explored were thosewith an average frequency of 8 to 14 hertz (cycles per second), and an ampli-tude of around 100 microvolts. Berger, astonished by their regularity, calledthem alpha waves.The discovery was ignored for some years. Then, in 1934, two BritishScientists, Lord Edgar Adrian and B.C.H. Matthews, confirmed Berger’s find-ings - regular brain activity could also be measured in normal, conscious sub-jects that was identical to the alpha frequencies detected by Berger. Personsemitting these waves were in a state somewhere between waking and sleep,both physically and mentally relaxed, with all neurons emitting the samefrequency of brain wave.Berger, meanwhile, had discovered beta waves, with a higher frequency(14 hertz) and a lower amplitude (10 to 50 microvolts). These waves corre-sponded to a state of vigilance, attention and concentration on exterior ob-jects, while alpha waves, as mentioned earlier, correspond to a state ofinteriorization. The perfection of the electroencephalogram allowed research-ers to measure other types of brain waves:• theta waves (4 to 7 hertz, 200 microvolts) which are emitted during certainphases of sleep or under certain emotional conditions;"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 104• delta waves (3 hertz or less, 200 microvolts to 1 millivolt amplitude) whichcharacterize deep sleep or a state approaching death.EEG’s provide us with a very general idea of brain activity. W. Grey Walter,who has been conducting research on EEG measurements for years, com-pares the information provided by an EEG readout to that of a deaf-muteMartian trying to understand human language by examining the grooves ina record.Nevertheless, alpha waves have attracted particular attention over thelast few years. Over 30 kinds of portable bio-feedback devices have appearedon the market, and various fields of study, including medicine, parapsychol-ogy, pediatrics, and pedagogy, have been experimenting with ways to usealpha waves for therapeutic purposes.The media has also done its part to stir up the controversy over alphawaves. Why are people so interested?The alpha wave mysteryPersons who practice telepathy prepare themselves psychologically byentering a state in which they are completely relaxed, yet attentive - concen-trating on a single point of non-existence, as one expert put it. As it turns out,one characteristic of this state is that the brain emits alpha waves.“The connection between alpha waves and telepathy is crucial,” writesLyall Watson in his book ‘A Natural History of the Supernatural.’Doctor Beaumanoir, a student of Professor Gastaut (quoted earlier in thischapter) managed to study, film, and take EEG readings of a group of firewalkers during a ceremony held in Greece. The fact that initiates were able todance barefoot on burning hot coals is incontestable - it’s there for everyoneto see, recorded on film. Beaumanoir insists that no protective products wereused to coat the soles of the feet - non-initiates who tried to walk on the coalswere burned. EEG readings showed that persons who were able to walk and"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 105dance on the coals emitted a steady stream of alpha waves throughout theexperience.Yogis who are able to withstand cold and even melt snow as they sitnaked in the Himalayan mountains also emit alpha waves.How can you enter the alpha state?It’s very simple: sitting down in a quiet place, staring off into space andnot thinking about anything in particular will increase alpha wave emissions.You can also learn some relaxation technique, or practice a method likesophrology.According to a study conducted at Trinity College in San Antonio, Texas,the state induced by the practice of Silva’s Mind Control method also in-crease alpha wave activity.Another method: roll your eyes back as far as possible and concentrateon a point in the middle of your forehead.Repeating the same word or phrase (it could be a prayer or a mantra) orany sound at the same rhythm will eventually produce the same result.EEG readings show that whenever a subject is distracted by a suddennoise or sensation, alpha wave activity immediately ceases and is replacedby beta waves. If there is no further interference, alpha activity graduallyresumes. If the stimulus is repeated regularly, the senses quickly become ac-customed to it, allowing alpha activity to predominate, without coming to ahalt.A metronome or the steady beat of a drum are both excellent stimuli forinducing the alpha state. Yoga, Zen meditation and some occult techniquesachieve the same effect: concentrating on a point in the body or on a mandala,emptying the mind, adopting a certain breathing rhythm, concentrating on aZen ‘koan’ (a kind of spiritual riddle), staring at a tarot card, etc., are all tech-niques you can use to enter the alpha state."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 106It seems, then, that alpha waves form the grid on which all paranormalphenomena appear.Does that mean that persons who produce an unusually high percentageof alpha waves are special? Not at all. In fact, the opposite is true: “Generallyspeaking, persons who produce a preponderance of alpha waves in their EEGreadings are rather listless, uninteresting, unimaginative and ordinary,” claimsBarbara Brown, a bio-feedback specialist. Although this seems to contradictwhat we just said, it doesn’t, the reason being that such people are not able toprolong alpha activity by making a conscious effort - a weak, distracted mindcannot control the type of brain waves it produces.What is the alpha state? Theories abound, but the one that seems mostplausible to us reads as follows: Electrodes attached to the skull read onlyneo-cortex activity. We know very little about activity in the deeper parts ofthe brain, because they are only accessible through some type of neural sur-gery. It is probable that alpha waves are a signal of reduced activity in theneo-cortex, and increased activity in the rhinencephalon and other more primi-tive parts of the brain.Since paranormal faculties like ESP seem to be centered in these areas, itis not surprising that stimulating alpha wave activity, no matter how it isdone, will awaken these latent abilities.One criticism aimed at the stimulation of alpha activity through bio-feed-back is that it does not induce a state of relaxation, as manufacturers of vari-ous bio-feedback devices claim. In fact, the opposite is true: relaxation stimu-lates alpha activity. So why use a machine? Teaching people to relax using amethod like autogenic training, sophrology or mind control, should be morethan adequate. This has actually been proven by testing bio-feedback deviceson skilled yogis - results are always exceptionally positive.The best we can say about bio-feedback devices is that they may serve toreassure persons who would otherwise be skeptical about their ability to en-ter the alpha state. People who do use them, however, also make use of oneor another of the techniques mentioned above. It is as if the machine helps"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 107them rediscover the benefits of spiritual practices like meditation or yoga,acting as a bridge between two worlds, that of our modern, technologicalsociety, and the world of the ancient sages, with their highly developed un-derstanding of inner processes and the subconscious mind.We could say that inducing the alpha state is like opening a door andentering the realm of the subconscious. We should also mention that bio-feedback devices are much less harmful than other, more controversial meth-ods of alpha induction. As Dr. Brown states, “... substances like marijuana,LSD, heroine, alcohol and other drugs can also be used to increase alpha ac-tivity.”Drugs and the alpha stateMany people have found transcendental meditation - a technique thatuses the repetition of a simple mantra like ‘Om’ to focus the mind - to be anexcellent replacement for drugs. According to the Stanford Research Insti-tute, 60% to 90% of persons who used drugs at one time or another stoppedcompletely after a few months of this kind of meditation.On the 24th of May, 1972, the Illinois House of Representatives adopted aresolution which stated that: “Transcendental meditation represents a posi-tive alternative for people who have abused drugs. Studies indicate that it isthe most effective way yet discovered to prevent drug abuse.”People generating alpha waves, and more precisely waves that lie some-where between alpha and theta levels (between 5 and 8 hertz) experiencesensations comparable to those produced by various drugs. A number ofaddicts who have learned to attain the alpha state report feeling much likethey did when they took LSD.Elmer Green, director of the Menninger Foundation, claims that althoughLSD can induce a state similar to alpha, persons who rely on the drug haveno control over their mind. Using one of the consciousness-expanding tech-niques described earlier, however, does allow people to control their innerstate, and stop the experience whenever they want. Green goes on to say that"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 108the alpha state represents consciousness, while the emission of theta wavescharacterizes a state of unconsciousness. As long as at least some alpha wavesare still being produced, subjects remain clearly aware of their mental imag-ery, the ultimate goal being to enter a kind of creative trance which facilitatesthe association of images.Communicating with the subconsciousOne day a physicist named Glaser, who also happened to love good beer,became fascinated by the bubbles moving around in his glass. In a kind ofreverie, he conceived the first bubble chamber, now used in all particle accel-erator devices.The structure of the atom appeared to Niels Bohr while lost in a day-dream.A German chemist and engineer, August Kekulé, had the idea to developa formula for benzene in the same way.Whenever he was preoccupied by a problem, Sir Isaac Newton wouldtake a light nap and enter the alpha state, although he knew nothing aboutbrain waves or their effects.Dr. Green and his wife Alyce, a psychologist, trained students to remainin a state of creative trance for one hour each day, with excellent results. Stu-dents reported being able to talk to their subconscious, and some began de-veloping paranormal faculties. After some weeks of training, one 22 year oldstudent was able to say who was calling before picking up the phone. He wasnever wrong, even when the caller was someone he didn’t know, or hadn’theard from for a long time. When in the alpha / theta state, he had a numberof premonitory visions. One day he saw a fellow student bringing him a let-ter announcing that he had been accepted by a top university. Things un-folded exactly as he predicted - when he got home he found his friend wait-ing for him with a letter in hand. The friend had even opened the letter, al-though it was not addressed to him, exactly as he had done in the dreamvision."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 109Charles Tart, a psychologist specializing in special states of conscious-ness, suggests this method for generating and remembering mental images:“Stretch out on your back as if you were going to sleep, but hold one armup, slightly bent, in a position that requires a minimum of effort. Maintainingthis position will allow you to enter a state of creative imagery, and still re-member what you see. As soon as you start falling asleep, your arm will falland wake you up.”Genius - the rediscovery of childhoodIt is interesting to note that children between the ages of 4 to 7 produce anunusually high number of theta waves during the waking state. Childrenbetween 7 and puberty produce more alpha waves, while after puberty EEGreadings resemble those of adults, i.e. showing a preponderance of beta waves.Is it a coincidence that these changes correspond more or less exactly to adecrease of creativity and visualization ability which is characteristic of theaging process in children? We don’t think so. Young children who are givenexercises that demand the use of creativity and visualization seem to have notrouble tuning in to their inner imagery. It is only later, as they become youngadults, that children start relying more and more on logic, on so-called ratio-nal thought processes which become increasingly dependent on verbal ex-pression, and severely limit creativity.The ability to wonder, so characteristic of our childhood years, the fac-ulty of being able to perceive the world around us as if we were seeing it forthe first time, is cultivated by all great artists and inventors. An analysis ofAlbert Einstein’s EEG activity showed that he was often in an alpha state.Even when he was engaged in complex mathematical calculations, his brainwave activity registered no significant changes. It was only when a problemwas extremely difficult that beta activity would take over.In recent years the corporate / industrial world has become increasinglyinterested in the development of creativity. Management is the power of imagi-nation in action. Creativity sessions generally start with some form of regres-sion exercise - participants are guided back to a childhood state in order to"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Mind Control, Biofeedback and Alpha WavesPage 110break through the barrier of logic and liberate faculties of creativity and imagi-native association. Researchers became interested in monitoring EEG activ-ity during these kinds of sessions. You can probably guess the result - cre-ative activity is always characterized by a significant increase in alpha waveproduction."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 111PsychocyberneticsBack in the 1960’s, a book was written that has become a classic in thefield of personal development. Psychocybernetics by Dr. Maxwell Maltz hasbeen read in its original or translated form by millions of people around theworld.It all started with a failure of a sort.Maxwell Maltz, a brilliant plastic surgeon practicing in England, France,Germany, Italy and South America, became interested in psychology afternoticing how various facial operations affected the personalities of his pa-tients.He had the impression that as he altered their physical body, he was also,in some way, modifying his patients’ minds. In his first book, ‘New Faces -New Futures,’ he explained how, by modifying the exterior features of a per-son, you also changed that person’s inner being. Personality, behavior, andability were transformed to an astonishing extent, as if they were closely linkedto the physical intervention.Problems like a lack of self confidence and other types of complexes dis-appeared, often in the weeks following an operation, allowing a new, morefulfilled personality to emerge.And yet, in some cases, no psychological changes were apparent after anoperation. The removal of the fault, scar or malformation which the patientwas so worried about seemed to have no psychological effect at all. Thesepatients continued living, thinking and feeling much as they had before - asif nothing had changed."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 112Maltz found the apparent discrepancy troubling, and tried to find an ex-planation.He concluded that some special aspect of a patient’s psyche was usuallyaffected by plastic surgery, and that when that special aspect was modified,the patient’s personality would change at the same time. On the other hand,when that special aspect was not modified, the patient’s behavior remainedthe same as before, even though his or her appearance had been radicallyaltered. It was as if personality had its own ‘face.’To become a great plastic surgeon, Maltz felt he had to operate on apatient’s immaterial face, in the same way as he operated on physical fea-tures. He became convinced that people developed a powerful mental or spiri-tual self image. If he could find some way of modifying this self image, hecould radically transform a patient’s personality.He asked a number of psychologists about the concept of self image. Howwas it formed? What physiological processes were involved? Why was it soimportant? And most importantly, how could it be modified?The answers he got were vague, incomplete and disappointing. Strangelyenough, a new scientific discipline, exploring the frontiers of physics andmathematics, provided him with the information he was seeking.CyberneticsShortly before the outbreak of World War Two, a group of doctors andscientists began holding weekly debates on various subjects of common in-terest.Two of the participants, A. Rosenbluth, a physiology specialist, andNorbert Wiener, a mathematician and designer of electronic systems, devel-oped an entirely new field of study which they called cybernetics. Their theorywas based on the observation that communication systems developed by"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 113animals, and the human nervous system itself, could both be compared to anelectronic machine.As they tried to create what they called ‘servo-systems’ and synthesizethe process of controlled action, they rediscovered the laws governing hu-man reflexive behavior. In-depth studies showed that human behavior andautomated systems fit into the same schema.“Of course we must be careful not to consider humans as nothing morethan complex machines. The human brain is vastly more complex than a com-puter. It is impossible to reproduce all known human biological functions,not to mention those we still don’t understand. With that in mind, we couldsay that the great advantage of cybernetics is that it gives us a clear workingmodel on which to base further research.”Cybernetics attempts to explain how and why machines - and humanbeings - function, by synthesizing widely varied psychological theories intoa single system. Maltz predicted that cybernetics would revolutionize thewhole field of psychology, stating that we should not be surprised if answersto questions about the human psyche could be found in other disciplines,namely physics and mathematics. Specialists who think they know every-thing there is to know about a given subject often have great difficulty com-ing up with innovative ideas and solutions, limited as they are by the confor-mity of their acquired knowledge.The word cybernetics was invented by the ancient Greeks, and is foundin a number of Plato’s Dialectics. The term refers to the art of directing, con-trolling or governing. Directing or controlling anything - for example ma-nipulating the rudder of a boat - first requires the choice of an objective orgoal.In his theory of psycho-cybernetics, Maxwell Maltz shows that how hu-man beings make use of an incredible machine - the human brain and ner-vous system - in order to achieve specific goals. The fact that we are free tochoose our goals separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. This free-dom of choice is what gives humanity its grandeur and privileged place on"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 114the evolutionary scale. On the other hand, we still have to know how to pro-gram our brain, once a choice has been made, in order to attain what wedesire. When programming is carried out effectively, all our cerebral and ner-vous functions work together to help us achieve what we have set out toaccomplish. In other words our mind becomes a machine geared to success.If, on the other hand, our mental programming is ineffective, then our ownmind works against us, forcing us to act in ways that result in failure.The first law of psycho-cybernetics is that, in order to succeed, we mustact in accordance with our own self image. Trying to do things that run counterto our self image will inevitably result in failure.Experience and self imageAs we saw earlier, some form of suggestion or conditioning can alter aperson’s self image. In his approach, Maltz considered experience a key fac-tor in creating and / or modifying self image. The successes and failures wehave experienced in the past condition our future. They are the referencepoints on which we model our behavior. For example, do you remember thefirst time you drove a car? You were probably extremely nervous. Each ofyour actions required a concentrated effort. Why? Because your experienceof driving was very limited, you had few if any memories upon which youcould model your present actions. Gradually, as you acquired more and moreexperience, your actions became more accurate and effective, until you fi-nally reached a point where you could break, steer, change gears, make com-plicated trajectory calculations and turn up the volume on your car stereo, allat the same time, with hardly any effort at all.At this stage, driving is more or less reflexive - your behavior is beingeffectively controlled by a servomechanism, made up of your brain and ner-vous system.An intellectual understanding is not enough to guide your behavior inan effective way - you also need experience."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 115Would you risk your life by allowing a medical student who has neverused a scalpel in his life, to operate on you, even though he may have studiedthe procedure in class? You’d probably be a little nervous, and rightly so, because in most hu-man activities, the key to success is experience.There’s a saying that says success breeds success. The inverse is also true- we all know people whose lives seem to be a constant series of failures, whogo from one crisis to another, who seem to be living under a cloud.When our self image is positive, forged on memories of success, love,fulfillment, and so on, our behavior will conform to our desires. In other words,our subconscious will work in harmony with our conscious mind, to achievethe goals we set for ourselves.If, on the other hand, we see ourselves as unworthy, as inferior, withoutmerit or ability, then our behavior will be guided by that negative self image,no matter how positive a goal we set for ourselves. Obstacles, accidents, frus-trating situations, emotional upsets and so on, will keep arising to prevent usfrom exploiting our full potential, and in turn from attaining our goals.How can a negative self image be changed?If experience is the best tool for change, why not use it? Well, the problemis, experience is sometimes hard to swallow - the school of life has some hardknocks.Throwing a non-swimmer into a lake is a dangerous way to teach some-one how to swim - the person may survive, but he could also drown. Themilitary is designed to turn boys into men in precisely that manner. Unfortu-nately it also turns some into dangerous killers.The ideal situation would be to:• condition people gradually, in a laboratory setting, in order to develop new"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 116modes of behavior;• substitute existing negative behavior patterns with stronger positive patterns,by providing people with positive experiences that are stronger than the nega-tive ones they have acquired.Any effective behavior-modifying technique should be based on that prin-ciple.The subconscious mind does not differentiate between actual experienceand what is intensely imaginedThis clinical discovery in the field of psychology has made it a lot easierto put various techniques of image modification into practice.Our self image is affected just as much by what we vividly imagine as bywhat we actually experience. Does that seem hard to believe? Well, remem-ber the placebo effect we talked about earlier. If the mind believes that a cer-tain medication, real or not, will be effective, it is able to trigger a process thatcures physical or psychological health problems.Say your spouse receives a letter and refuses to show it to you. You im-mediately imagine he or she is being unfaithful, and suffer because of it. Inactual fact, the letter may be about a sick parent, or a financial problem. Whatyou believe to be true, and not the reality of the situation, is what affects youmost.Another example: a psychologist comes in to test the IQ’s of a class ofhigh school students. The psychologist then tells teachers and parents thatone student, who did not seem to be particularly gifted, has a very high IQ(this is not true - the student’s IQ is really average). A few months later thestudent’s marks have drastically improved, and his self confidence has soared.Why?Because teachers began treating him differently, encouraging him to ex-ploit his potential. Their attitude was transferred to the other students, which"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 117boosted his self confidence, resulting in better marks.The importance of failure does not lie in the experience itself, but in theeffect it has on us. Maltz was struck by the way similar types of scars couldaffect people in very different ways. Take these two cases:• A car salesman is partially disfigured in a car accident. Every time he looks inthe mirror he thinks people must find him repulsive, because he looks different.His appearance becomes an obsession for him, causing him to lose confidenceand become more and more aggressive.• Another man acquires a similar scar while playing hockey. Far from findinghimself hideous, he feels proud of the disfigurement, considering it a mark ofvirility, and a source of self esteem.As you can see, the important factor is not the scar, but the psychologicaleffect the disfigurement has on these two people. Similarly, it isn’t what peoplethink about you that counts, it’s what you think they think. Take this idea onestep further and you come up with the following hypothesis: it isn’t who youare that counts, it’s who you believe you are.Under hypnosis, any individual can demonstrate almost Herculeanstrength on command. A shy, introverted person can deliver a brilliant speech,a person who normally stutters can talk perfectly normally, and in some casespersons who are paralyzed regain the use of their limbs. People who are con-vinced they can’t draw create extraordinary works of art when it is suggestedthat they have the talent of a Renoir or a Van Gogh. Inversely, subjects underhypnosis may no longer be able to write their own names, walk normally oreven unclench their own fist. Suggest that a subject is being sought by thepolice, and he will immediately turn into a harried criminal.The influence exerted by the people around us, as well as our own thoughtpatterns, can have the same impact on our behavior as that of a skilled hyp-notist. Both can help us exploit our enormous potential to its fullest or, whenthey are negative, create imaginary limitations that prevent us from accom-plishing what we would like to achieve, from being the person we would liketo be."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 118It doesn’t matter if the input received by our subconscious mind is trueor false - it will react in accordance with that information, and most espe-cially in accordance with the goals we establish for ourselves. The importantfactor is self image, whether it be formulated as an intellectual concept shapedby language, or as mental imagery. These words, these beliefs or mental im-ages, are what create us, through the power of the mind.“Man can only discover what he has already imagined,” wrote one re-searcher studying the mechanisms of the brain, in light of the new science ofcybernetics.We are constantly programming ourselves without being aware of it, of-ten to our detriment. When we are preoccupied by worries, when we areafraid of something, when we brood about some failure or think negativethoughts about ourselves, we are actually programming our mind in a waythat will influence our future behavior.As Maxwell Maltz wrote in Psychocybernetics: “Generating your ownmental images through visualization is no more difficult than rememberinga past event. Acting according to a new model of behavior is no more diffi-cult than deciding to tie your shoelaces in a different way, and then carryingout that decision instead of repeating actions like an automaton, purely outof habit.”Anxiety and the inferiority complexAs I traveled around the world conducting seminars on personal devel-opment, I met thousands of people who were suffering from a lack of selfconfidence. Although they were often not aware of it, this lack of faith intheir own abilities, this mutilated self image, undermined their very exist-ence. All had developed an inferiority complex, to some degree. Even peoplewho seemed to be bursting with confidence were often only maintaining afacade, compensating for their inner lack of self esteem by putting up a bravefront. They may have fooled others for awhile, but they inevitably sufferedfrom periods of terrible, recurring anxiety."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 119As you read these lines, you may be saying “I am not one of those people.”Well, take a moment to think about it. There must be certain aspects of yourlife which you are not comfortable with, areas where you feel you could bedoing a lot better than you are, if it weren’t for something lacking in yourpersonality.Modern society imposes a model of success which many people can neverhope to attain. The fancy new car, big house, expensive home entertainmentsystem, beautiful kids and secure retirement savings plan, are things every-one wants, but relatively few actually have.It is very difficult to resist the incessant stream of suggestions imposedon us via the media, and avoid the trap of constantly comparing ourselves toour peers. Even if we feel only partially inferior, we will behave in accor-dance with that feeling.In fact, we are all inferior to someone or something: we may not be ableto cook or dance or drive as well as another person, we are surely less intelli-gent than the geniuses we keep hearing about, we are probably not as lovingor passionate as the people we see in movies or on TV.We are all inferior, in one way or another. And yet, not everyone devel-ops an inferiority complex. Why? Because some people know that in certainareas they are superior to others.Developing a complex about something involves not only knowing butfeeling. Because you never learned to dance properly, you may feel inferiorevery time you step on a dance floor. If you allow yourself to focus on thatfeeling of inferiority, you will forget about your other qualities and successes,and concentrate only on that negative aspect of your personality: you actu-ally become inferior, simply because you think you don’t know how to dance.What you should be thinking is: I never took dancing lessons, so it’s perfectlynormal for me to feel awkward on the dance floor."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 120We allow ourselves to become trapped by our own improperly expressedthoughts, and end up comparing ourselves to some ideal role model for noreason. Every individual is unique - it is impossible to attain any measure ofhappiness by comparing yourself to others. You are not inferior to me be-cause I happen to know more about mental dynamics than you do! It’s all aquestion of experience. Instead of judging our actions by what we have donein the past, we compare ourselves to others whose situation may be verydifferent from ours. And because we end up believing we are inferior, weactually feel inferior. We start thinking we are not normal, that there is some-thing wrong with us.The tension and stress we experience on a daily basis is generated by thiskind of vicious circle of negative thought patterns. We criticize ourselves in-cessantly, and this critical attitude is often encouraged by the people aroundus, who seem to rarely find anything good to say, either about themselves orabout anyone else.The question “Who am I?” triggers a series of negative images - “I aminferior to... I am incapable of ... I will never be able to...” etc.The truth about yourself is this:You are not inferior.You are not superior.You simply are who you are.You can’t compare your personality to anyone else’s, simply because thereis no one else in the entire world who is exactly like you. You are an indi-vidual. You are unique. You are not like anyone else, nor can you ever be-come like anyone else. You are not supposed to be like anyone else, and noone is supposed to be like you.How to get rid of your complexes and be yourselfThe only way to get rid of your complexes and really be yourself is toimagine yourself as you could be if you exploited your full potential, free"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 121from the limitations that are undermining your self image. Of course the aimhere is not to create some kind of inflated, false image that has nothing to dowith your real potential. You simply have to see yourself as you could be-come, and let that image impregnate your subconscious mind for a period of21 days, which is the time it usually takes to develop any kind of new habit,or become accustomed to a new situation, whether it be to a new hairstyle,house, job, etc.The question then arises of what to do when negative thoughts or imagesabout yourself do arise, which they inevitably will. Cybernetics has the an-swer: a servomechanism will attain its objective both by trying - and failing -to do so. Failures are examined and analyzed, and the necessary correctionsare made. Negative past experiences, ingrained in our memory, do not neces-sarily inhibit the functioning of this servomechanism, but can actually con-tribute to the process of learning.Errors should be seen as stages on the road to success. Once they areproperly analyzed, mistakes can be used to help us. Once they have servedtheir purpose, you can forget them. The worst thing you can allow yourselfto do is think, “I failed in the past, therefore I will fail in the future.”F.M.H. Myers, a well known psychologist, explained how persons whowere ordinarily shy and withdrawn could be transformed into brilliant ora-tors under hypnosis by being purged of memories of past failures. In fact, thesame effect can also be achieved on conscious subjects.When he was young, Doctor Alfred Adler, a friend of Maltz, did poorlyin arithmetic at school. His teacher soon became convinced that little Alfreddid not have a mathematical mind. He told the boy’s parents, who immedi-ately accepted the verdict, claiming that since the family tended to be moreliterary-minded, they were not surprised their son was not interested in math.Influenced by this negative feedback, the boys math grades began steadilydropping.One day, however, the teacher presented the class with a difficult mathproblem, and said anyone who could find the solution would get the highest"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 122mark in the class. Only one arm was raised - by little Alfred. The entire classburst out laughing.“Well Alfred, show us your solution,” the teacher said, hardly managingto hide the derision in his voice.When he looked at Alfred’s paper he was shocked - the boy, in a flash ofinsight, had managed to come up with the solution to a problem that wouldhave taken college students hours to figure out.The incident had a profound effect on the boy - instead of accepting thesuggestion that he didn’t have a head for math, he became convinced that hewas somehow gifted in mathematics. His marks soared, and he went on toforge a career in science.When we use our mind to modify our self image, thoughts must be ac-companied by emotions. The event that marked young Alfred Adler did sobecause it had a powerful emotional impact on him.Doctor Wilder Penfield, a neurosurgeon at McGill University in Montreal,Canada, showed that persons could be made to relive past events simply byelectrically stimulating certain brain cells. The scenes were so vivid, subjectsactually thought they were happening all over again.“Subjects feel the same emotions that were generated by the original event,and are aware of forming the same opinions and interpretations, whethertrue or false, as they did when they first had the experience. Thus the memoryevoked by the stimulation of brain cells is not simply a visual or auditoryrepresentation of a past event, but an integral reproduction of everything thesubject saw, heard, felt and understood at the time.”This is exactly what happens when we modify our self image: if we imag-ine details, colors, odors, sensations and emotions with enough sharpnessand clarity, they can actually replace previous images which are detrimentalto our progress."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 123Analyzing the things that make us worry or preoccupy us in the rightway can provide us with a clear notion of how to proceed in order to changeour objectives.When we worry, we start by thinking about some unpleasant incidentthat is likely to recur in the near future. It could be an event like the loss of aloved one, or being laid off at work, a letter we received containing bad news,an interview which did not go well, etc.The more we think about the event, the more details it evokes, and themore real the event becomes. We soon start feeling the negative emotionsassociated with it - tension, disappointment, anguish, and so on. As Maltzremarked, there is no effort of will involved - the cause of our anxiety is sim-ply the result of our uncontrolled imagination.Willpower and imaginationCaycedo, in his theory of sophrology, claimed that by forming a positiveimage of themselves, by imagining themselves as being happy and fulfilled,people actually create the possibility of their own happiness by triggeringpositive reactions in their organism.Sick people who can visualize themselves being healed, who really wantto break out of the cycle of illness, recover more quickly than others. Theimportant thing is that they get better not because they want to, but becausethey can actually see themselves as healthy, happy individuals. It is this in-tense imagery that stimulates their hope and their will to recover.Willpower... some people don’t seem to have any, while others seem al-most superhuman in what they can accomplish through sheer will. For yearsI believed that willpower was the result of effort, of an ability to exceed one’slimits through conscious action, often under very difficult circumstances. Likemany people, my definition of willpower was based on a cliche that seemedinaccessible - with their jaw thrust forward and their muscles taught, the for-tunate few endowed with tremendous willpower could overcome any ob-stacles, through sheer effort. However, as I read biographies of famous people,"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 124I realized that this energy, this force, is not produced by effort at all, but origi-nates in having a clear image of the objectives you are trying to achieve.The best salesman I ever met is considered by everyone who knows himto have tremendous willpower. A former director of marketing for a multina-tional corporation, he decided to give up his job at the age of 30 and getinvolved in sales. Being a rather weak negotiator, he didn’t do too well forthe first six months or so. Then he started making steady progress. He soonbecame the top salesman for a company employing over 500 people, sellingfinancial products. Today, at the age of 35, he is the company’s sales director.He seems able to succeed at anything he tries. Where, I wondered, does heget all that willpower?My friend happens to belong to an occult group which teaches a secrettechnique that has been preserved for centuries: the art of mental imagery.He motivates himself by visualizing exactly what he wants to achieve. It isthis technique that has enabled him to succeed where so many others havefailed. Napoleon practiced the art of war in his mind for years before actuallycommanding an army. That is why he was successful. Later, by becomingmore and more afraid of failure, he programmed his own downfall. A carefulanalysis of the last part of his life clearly shows how his mind became in-creasingly obsessed with thoughts of failure.When a servomechanism like the human mind loses sight of its objective,it will adjust its trajectory according to errors that are made, in order to getitself back on track. Even though we have programmed ourselves for failure,we may inadvertently lose sight of our underlying objective from time totime, and encounter some minor successes, by mistake so to speak. However,if our subconscious objective is to fail, we will be inexorably drawn towardsthat goal. This is the basis of the ancient Greek concept of fate - man’s destinyis decided by the gods, and no matter how much of a conscious effort wemake to avoid our fate, we are ultimately powerless to prevent it."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 125How to resolve problemsMaxwell Maltz saw life as a series of problems that must be resolved.Types of problems range from the relatively simple, like how to hit a tennisball, to the extremely complex - new situations for which we are totally un-prepared, lacking any experience on which to base our decisions.Here again a comparison with computers is appropriate. A simple prob-lem requires a simple set of instructions : chase the ball and hit it back overthe net. The physical operations required to achieve this goal are governedby the subconscious mind (a servomechanism).Resolving complex problems requires a more sophisticated set of instruc-tions. Like a computer programmer writing a new program, you have to makea conscious effort to analyze and understand the problem at hand, accumu-late data, and load all that information into the processor - your brain. Onlythen can the servomechanism come up with results.Creativity works in much the same way - after considering a problemfrom all possible angles you have to relax and let it simmer for awhile, until asolution appears. Artists, inventors and other creative people talk about some-thing called inspiration - new ideas are always there, all you need is somekind of mechanism to help you tune into them. Musicians often claim thatthey simply hear a new tune while walking along the street or daydreamingon a park bench. Mathematicians have flashes of inspiration that allow themto see the solution to a complex problem in their mind, almost as if it werewritten out in front of them.Modern man, on the other hand, tends to rely solely on rational thoughtto solve problems. The myth of reason and logic is so strong, so overwhelm-ing, it has all but buried our faculties of intuition and creativity. We becomeanxious when we can’t find an immediate solution to a problem, when ourrational mind seems to let us down. The old adage ‘ask and ye shall receive’sounds childishly naive. Placing our faith in some form of irrational inspira-tion seems completely unacceptable in a world governed by science.

Solutions to problems often arise in the same way.The great classical composer Franz Schubert once told a friend that com-posing was simply a matter of remembering a melody, and then writing itdown.To do that, you have to be convinced that what you are seeking alreadyexists, and it is here that psychocybernetics and paranormal phenomena startto overlap.Is creativity a parapsychological phenomenon?The servomechanism that is our mind works with data drawn from ex-perience, knowledge and memory. The question may be raised whether it iscapable of using other, paranormal data as well.Arthur Koestler, in his book The Roots of Chance, includes the followingquote on the subject: “If paranormal awareness and paranormal causality arefacts, it is probable that they are not limited to those rare, sporadic occasionswhere they manifest themselves in some spectacular way, nor to very specialconditions under which we can prove their presence through experimenta-tion. What is probable is that they are in constant operation, acting behindthe scenes so to speak, during the course of our day to day lives. Our aware-ness of what other people are thinking or feeling, our sense of humor oncertain occasions, the way ideas seem to arise out of nowhere, for no obviousreason, our immediate and inexplicable emotional reactions to certainpeople... all these phenomena may be partially determined by paranormalcognition, and influenced by paranormal causality.”"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 127If, as we will be explaining later on, it would be possible for you to ac-quire information from any brain in the world, from some kind of universalmind or collective unconscious, and if, in addition, you could exert a mentalinfluence on the people around you, resolving almost any problem wouldbecome mere child’s play. Luck or chance would no longer be an arbitrary,capricious phenomenon, but would depend on the way you program yourobjectives.Imagine that your servomechanism is programmed for success. It wouldgather an idea here, a fact there, combine them with a series of past experi-ences and associations, and organize them into an elaborate structure whichwill provide you with the tools you need to deal with any given situation, inorder to solve the problems at hand and achieve the success you are aimingfor.When solutions arise spontaneously in your conscious mind, often dur-ing moments of inattention, while you are thinking about something else, orin a dream, when your conscious mind is at rest, something is triggered thatimmediately lets you know you have found the solution you’ve been lookingfor. It’s almost like the radar equipment on a plane detecting another objectin the sky.There is so much to say about psychocybernetics we could not hope toprovide an in-depth study of the subject within the context of this book. Theimportant thing is to try it out for yourself, and see what it can do for you inpractical terms. You may find your life becoming a series of amazing ‘coinci-dences,’ all of which seem to be working towards attaining your goals, bring-ing you into contact with the people and resources you need to achieve yourobjectives.I have often found myself perplexed after analyzing a series of fortuitousevents (normally attributed to pure luck) which helped me attain what I wasaiming for, which transformed the mental image I had formed of myself be-forehand into a reality."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"PsychocyberneticsPage 128There is always something magical about the way things seem to fall intoplace.

Looking back, everything seems so easy, as if ithad been predestined, as if a magician had waved a wand and made ourdreams come true.

The method was being used by a sales organization, to help execu-tives develop their personality. Apparently, the results were amazing, andwhen I heard about them I decided to try using the method when I returnedhome.I would have occasion to see the same kind of positive results in the UnitedStates and Japan. In 1970 I was teaching psychocybernetics to teams of salesrepresentatives. In 1972, after attending a series of psychology workshops inthe U.S., Jean-Claude Gimet, a cybernetics specialist who hosted seminars onmanagement and planning, suggested that we work together on personaldevelopment seminars which would be offered to corporate clients. With thehelp of Phillip Lecomte, a psychologist and director of a large mining con-cern, who happened to be interested in the same techniques, I came up witha plan for a three day seminar. A short time later the three of us conductedour first seminar, which we called the Personal Achievement Seminar - a courseon personal development based on the psychology of self image. The resultswe obtained led to our being hired by a number of large industrial and com-mercial corporations. We conducted seminars for their sales and technicalstaff. Since then, Personal Achievement Seminars have become the main prod-uct of Sodiac Training Incorporated, the company we founded together.Although psychocybernetic techniques are usually practiced in a state ofordinary relaxation, I was convinced that the same techniques could be dou-bly effective if applied to persons in an altered state of consciousness. Forthat reason I became interested in self-hypnosis, biofeedback and sophrology.It was while attending a seminar based on Silva’s Mind Control technique"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 130that we decided to try and come up with a unified method that would incor-porate all the techniques we had encountered to date.We began experimenting with the alpha state and integrating techniquesborrowed from sophrology and parapsychology during our personal devel-opment courses. Based on the results of these experiments, the concept of analpha seminar began to take shape.The first prototype was developed with a group of friends in January,1974. News of the extraordinary results we obtained spread quickly, both byword of mouth and through the media. Since then, over 1000 people havebenefited from the seminar, which we called Mental Dynamics.The average person uses about two billion, out of a total of about tenbillion brain cells. Stimulating mental faculties through the techniques whichcomprise the mental dynamics method helps people exploit more of theirmental and physical capacities. All the techniques described in this book upto now have been incorporated into the method.The hard part was organizing them into some kind of coherent system.Based on a model of forty-five minute sessions, we came up with a series offifteen complimentary exercises which, together, comprise what came toknown as the Alpha Seminar.The Alpha SeminarThe first objective of the alpha seminar is relaxation - teaching partici-pants how to enter the alpha state.I was surprised to hear from a number of people who, after reading thisbook, made the following objection: “You say that all we have to do to attainthe alpha state is listen to a calm voice or focus on some part of our body.That can’t be true, it sounds too easy. You must be holding something back.”"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 131Their concern reminded me of similar objections I heard about hypnosis:“It sound so easy to hypnotize someone. There must be a trick to it, somekind of special power involved.”Until you have experienced these phenomena for yourself, it is difficultto accept how incredibly simple they are. We’re not used to simplicity, it seems,and anything that appears to be simple raises our suspicions. “How can thisbe really effective if it’s so easy?”It’s a little like visiting someone for the first time. You have to watch whereyou’re going, check all the street names, look for the number of the house, inorder not to get lost. The second or third time you pay the person a visit, youhave much less trouble reaching your destination. If you keep going back tothe same house, you soon don’t have to think about where you’re going atall.The first time you try to practice alpha relaxation you may encounterproblems, especially if you’re tense or nervous about something. On the otherhand, tense, nervous people are most in need of learning how to attain thealpha state. So in the first part of the seminar, we included the most effectivetechniques for inducing the alpha state that we had come across. Whereas ittook almost forty-five minutes to get participants into the alpha state at thestart of the seminar, it took a maximum of two minutes to attain the samelevel of consciousness at the end. How was that possible? Well, read on.The Signpost EffectA signpost is any other gesture or word that is automatically associatedwith a certain state or activity. It could be a snap of the fingers or the raisingof an arm for a couple of seconds. Like a uniform, which immediately elicitsa reflexive reaction of respect or fear, or a red traffic light which causes you tostep on the breaks, any gesture can become a signal that will induce the alphastate.The only drawback with this technique is its rapidity. If a subject passesfrom a state of stress to a state of deep mental and muscular relaxation too"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 132suddenly, problems can arise. For that reason, an effective signpost should beone that a subject can evoke him or herself, and which takes effect gradually.A very effective signpost is the countdown, either from 10 to 1, or 3 to 1.As they count, subjects imagine themselves descending deeper and deepertowards the center of their being. They could visualize themselves descend-ing a flight of stairs, or riding down an elevator while counting, or havingsomeone else count for them, suggesting that they are becoming more andmore relaxed the lower they get.At first, subjects are helped along by being led through a complete relax-ation session, muscle by muscle, limb by limb (as described on page —). Insubsequent sessions, the relaxation period is progressively shortened, until asignpost is all it takes to induce a state of complete relaxation.Imagine someone who has lost his memory. The only thing he can do istalk and listen. Using words to describe a simple act like lighting a cigarettewould be extremely difficult. You’d first have to explain what matches are,what they look like, how to separate one from the rest of the pack, how tohold it, scratch it on the special paper so it will light, being careful not to getburned, how to hold it close to one end of the cigarette while inhaling on theother end, etc. In other words, the process would take a lot of time and con-centration.Once the person has learned how to light a cigarette, the whole series ofsteps becomes automatic.The same applies to relaxation. After a few sessions, during which step-by-step instructions are provided, the process becomes automatic - all youhave to do to enter the alpha state of deep relaxation is count down from 10to 1.The choice of a signpost is important. A signpost image or techniqueshould be both gradual and relaxing. I remember one man who attended oneof our seminars who was incapable of relaxing using the countdown sign-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 133post because he was an airline pilot. Counting down from 10 to 1 was alwaysassociated with stress in his mind.For that reason, we generally recommend using the colors of the rainbowas a signpost, colors being a universal symbol.Color symbolismAs we mentioned earlier, colors have a definite psychological effect (re-member the example of how different colored detergent packages had a dif-ferent impact on consumers). Advertisers and marketing experts have con-ducted in-depth studies on the effects of colors on consumers. Some colorsare hot, some are cold, some are stimulating, others are relaxing, some areheavy, some are light. Max Luscher, a German psychologist, perfected a per-sonality test based solely on a subject’s color preferences. You can even testyourself and measure changes in your temperament by comparing them tochanges in your taste for color. The more you test yourself, the more yourealize that you don’t simply like one color more than another, but that yourpreference for various colors changes along with the rest of your personality,depending on the situation you happen to find yourself in. In other words,your taste evolves along with your mind.The color of an object depends on the wavelength of light that it reflects.When an object reflect the entire range of visible colors, it appears to be white.When it absorbs all visible colors, it appears to be black. The spectrum ofcolors found in the rainbow is composed of the range of electromagnetic waveswhich can be perceived by the human eye.At the upper end of the spectrum the human eye perceives red (with awavelength of about 7000 angstroms). Infrared light, with a higher wave-length, is invisible to most humans. Hot colors are those which are closest tothe infrared wavelength. Although from a physiological point of view thesecolors cause no actual temperature changes in the body, they do stimulatenervous and glandular systems, affecting functions like respiration, heart-beat, blood pressure, and so on."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 134Let’s take a look at the separate colors of the rainbow and their effects.Red: Symbol of fire, blood, conquest and virility, red has a stimulatingeffect. In photography labs, workers who spent long hours under red lightdeveloped psychological problems which disappeared when the red lightwas replaced with its complimentary color, green. Red is often a favorite colorof children, very active persons, and people living in primitive cultures.Orange: Linked to emotion, orange is less mentally stimulating than red.Being a gentler color, it is more intimate and inviting.Yellow: The warm luminosity of yellow invokes light and wealth, bothspiritual and material. It symbolizes daily activity - body and mind are ac-tive, but not inflamed as is the case with red.Green: Green can be warm or cold, depending on whether it containsmore yellow or blue. Situated in the middle of the spectrum, it is the color ofbalance, and symbolizes peace. Green has a soothing effect on the nervoussystem, and more green and blue are found in nature than any other color. Inthe Islamic faith green is the symbol of spiritual awareness, and is used ex-tensively to decorate flags, tiles, drapery, etc.At the other end of the spectrum are the so-called cold colors, which havea soothing, balancing effect on the organism. Closest to ultraviolet light arepurple, blue and blue-green, all of which slow down heartbeat and reduceblood pressure. As the physical body relaxes, it becomes easier for the mindto concentrate or meditate.Blue: Being the coldest color, blue suggests a state of calm, rest and relax-ation. Therapists use blue, associated with night and sleep, to alleviate hy-peractivity.Purple: When composed primarily of blue, purple symbolizes the unionof man with the divine. A lot of purple is used by the Catholic church (forvestments, images, statues, etc.) and by other mystical orders."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 135If red is the predominant color, purple symbolizes earthly power, and isoften used for royal vestments and accoutrements.Purple’s combined calming and stimulating effect tends to induce an al-most hypnotic state of mind which is appropriate for spiritual endeavors.Interestingly enough, 75% of adolescents claim that purple is their favoritecolor, perhaps because purple is also associated with imagination, which mostteenagers have a lot of.So as you can see, the spectrum of colors starting with red and movingtowards purple have an increasingly relaxing, calming effect on the mind.This makes the rainbow image an excellent signpost. In addition, colors areeasy to visualize - all you have to do is remember any object for a given color- a banana for yellow, a tomato for red, etc.How colors affect childrenBecause their visual faculties are still relatively fresh and unencumberedby words, children make excellent subjects - simply getting them to visualizethe spectrum of colors from red to violet is usually enough to induce a stateof alpha relaxation.Here’s what some fifth grade students had to say in answer to the follow-ing questions, after they experimented with visualizing colors:• At what point did you start to feel the effects of the colors?• Which colors were easiest to visualize?• Did any of the colors trigger a sensation or a visual image?• How did you feel during the experiment?• Which moment do you remember the best?Student #1: “Red was a little hard to see. By the time I got to blue I wascompletely concentrated. I didn’t hear the voice of the instructor, and I feltmyself sinking down and getting very relaxed. This exercise is very good forthe body because it lets you relax completely, so you feel rested afterwards. I"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 136felt like I was in a thick forest, with the sky a very deep blue overhead. Dur-ing the session I felt like I was falling through infinite empty space.”Student #2: “I didn’t feel like myself during the experiment. I rememberthe colors red and violet the most. Then I saw my physical body, and at thesame time I thought about death - the two extremes, the two opposites. I sawimages of fields, fruit, leaves of all colors. I felt like I was gliding through theair in a plane, or on a boat in a storm. There was a lot of turbulence, and anearthquake when I concentrated on the color purple. A bunch of cruel thoughtsalso. Happy thoughts with the color red though...”Student #3: “I had trouble getting into the exercise at first, I just wasn’t inthe mood. But when the instructor got to green, in the middle of the spec-trum, I closed my eyes and saw a kind of green glow getting closer and thenmoving farther away, like a pulsing light. Blue made me feel sleepy. For purpleI saw clouds floating across the sky.”Student #4: “Red: I am resting, my body is relaxed, my feet are very heavy.I can’t hold my head up any longer. I hear my heart beating, my abdomenfeels heavy...“Orange: I am feeling more and more relaxed, my legs, my hands and myhead feel so heavy...“Yellow: I can’t remember anything...“Green: I feel happy, I’m thinking about going on vacation. I close myeyes because my eyelids feel so heavy...“Purple: I can hardly hear anything, the sounds I hear are all mixed to-gether...“Violet: I can’t hear your voice clearly. I feel like I’m ready to fall asleep.”Student #5: “Moving from yellow to green was hard because the twocolors are so different.”"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 137Student #6: “I felt like I was floating in the air at night.”Student #7: “When I got to orange I started feeling really good, like Iwanted to wake up but couldn’t, like it was time to get up in the morning butI still felt like sleeping and I was allowed to. Then with yellow I felt warmand really good.”Student #8: “By the time I got to purple I wasn’t thinking about anythinganymore. I felt like I was somewhere between being awake and being asleep.”Student #9: “I found the whole experience very interesting. I felt attractedto the color orange, and I saw myself falling down a tunnel, with the wallsgradually changing color as I fell.”Student #10: “Each color had a different sensation. For me red stood forcherries and strawberries, all sorts of red fruit, and red balloons flying in theair. Orange was the sun and the wind, with the rays of the sun spreading outand surrounding me with bright color. By the time I got to yellow I didn’t seeanything at all anymore, everything was just black. Green stood for a forest,leaves falling from the trees and landing at my feet. Blue was like a river orthe ocean, like I was swimming underwater...”Student #11: “It was like when I saw certain colors, especially blue andorange I became so tiny, so miniscule. I was like this dot on the surface of theearth. And then I was flying upwards, and my head started expanding, big-ger and bigger like it was going to burst. When I got to blue I saw very clearlythat it was night time, and I felt like a little star lighting up a small corner ofthe night sky. Orange made me think about a crackling fire, like I was watch-ing the fire, which made my face glow and warmed up my whole body. Then,all of a sudden it was like I fell down and I was almost dead. I felt like Iwasn’t me anymore, as if I had changed into another person...”Student #12: “I felt a wave of orange, a torrent of orange, a violent flashthat blinded me, then an expanse of green, and the blue and indigo and violetput me into a kind of trance. It was the purple colors that I felt the most. I"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 138couldn’t hear anything, I felt completely surrounded by color. I had troublecoming back.”Visualizing colors in their reverse order is a good way to gradually emergefrom the alpha state:“I felt like I had just been sleeping for hours.”“After it was over I felt totally relaxed.”“I came out of it slowly and gently.”“When I got back to the surface I felt completely relaxed.”“I started coming back up slowly, moving faster and faster.”“I can hear and see better than before.”“I felt like a diver coming up from the ocean floor at a thousand miles anhour.”“I feel great, but I don’t feel like running around or doing anything spe-cial, just being quiet.”To achieve similar results, normal adults would probably need a few train-ing sessions, unless they happen to be very much in touch with their emo-tions (people working in the arts, for example). Teaching Mental Dynamicsto high school or college students will produce better and faster results thanteaching the same techniques to adults. And, in fact, all attempts to teachstudents how to relax and enter the alpha state have produced extremelypositive results. Our traditional education system constantly demands thatstudents concentrate and remember things, without teaching them how toconcentrate, how to be more attentive and how to remember what they needto know. Instead of stimulating their faculties of visualization and concentra-tion, which would be of great help no matter what subjects they happen to be"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 139studying, they are left to find their own solutions, through a process of trialand error.We also know that certain cerebral centers, like the one that controls lan-guage, remain atrophied if they are not developed in time. In other words, ifchildren are not taught to speak by a certain age, they will remain more orless mute for the rest of their lives. Imagine if the same applied to that part ofour brain which is responsible for paranormal faculties.But to get back to the alpha seminar...Participants first learn to visualize colors in order to attain a state of com-plete mental and physical relaxation. They then learn to use the alpha state tomake changes in their personality and behavior. They learn how to changetheir self image, erase negative modes of behavior and substitute them withpositive experiences. They then apply the same methods to attain specificgoals like developing their intuition or a paranormal faculty like ESP, in or-der to acquire firsthand proof of the effectiveness of the technique.What happens during an alpha seminar?What actually takes place during an alpha seminar?Imagine a carpeted room large enough to accommodate about fifty peoplewith ease. About a third of the participants are there for the second or thirdtime, since they can come back as often as they like without paying. You are afirst-time participant. An instructor tells the group that they will be led througha series of exercises (described below) after being provided with a theoreticalexplanation of each one (corresponding to each of the chapters of this book),and followed by suggestions on how they can be applied in practical ways.Everyone is told to stand up, then stretch out on the carpet, using thepillows and blankets provided to make themselves comfortable. When ev-eryone has settled down, the instructor begins talking in a deep, slowsophronic monotone:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 140“Get ready to explore your inner levels of consciousness... start by visu-alizing the color red...” etc.The first exercise is designed to help participants enter the alpha state.You visualize colors, and feel your body getting heavier and heavier. Youcount down from 10 to 1, feeling an increasing sense of well being. Your mindremains aware while your body is completely relaxed and calm. You learn tocontrol your inner monologue, the thoughts that are constantly runningthrough your mind, often to your own detriment, thoughts like “I’m so stu-pid...” or “I know I’ll screw things up again...” or “I’ll never be able to...”and so on. You’ll learn how to condition your inner monologue so that it canwork for your benefit, replacing negative subconscious programming withpositive thoughts like “I am attaining my goals...” or “My concentration isimproving...” Since the subconscious is particularly receptive while you arein the alpha state, the process of replacing negative conditioning with posi-tive conditioning takes much less time, and is doubly effective.Next come the actual mental dynamics exercises. You learn to focus onsome goal you hope to attain, or on some memory that evokes the personyou would like to become, or develop a signpost that will immediately bringyour goal to mind.After the mental dynamics exercises, the instructor helps you emergegradually from the alpha state. You slowly become conscious of your body,regaining control of your movements until you are back in your ordinarystate of consciousness. You feel wonderfully relaxed, in harmony with your-self, and with life.After a short break, those who want to talk about their experiences whilein the alpha state are given an opportunity to do so. A dialog is set up be-tween the instructor, and the new and former participants. Then a secondinstructor takes over and leads the group through another set of exercises,the whole process being repeated fifteen times over the course of the week-end."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 141Here is an outline of activities for a typical alpha seminar lasting threedays:Day 1 (usually Friday evening) :• introduction, initial relaxation session;• total relaxation exercise;• learning to remain in the alpha state under difficult circumstances (noise, light,etc.);• constructing a mental screen, the first step in the process of visualization.Day 2 (all day Saturday) :• developing an awareness of self image;• modifying your self image;• how to develop self control (stop smoking, lose weight, accelerate healing, etc.)and improve your memory;• how to develop your creativity, how to remember your dreams and practicelucid dreaming any time you like;• how to recharge your energy.All these exercise are based on a synthesis of the various techniques wehave been discussing in this book, allowing anyone to develop and / or trans-form their personality on their own, without getting involved in a costly,lengthy and sometimes destructive process of psychotherapy.Purely medical applications, which generally fall into the category ofsophrology, are avoided. Over time, we have been able to perfect those tech-niques which are most effective for inducing the alpha state, even under con-ditions that are far from ideal. After all, what would be the use of learninghow to enter the alpha state while you are stretched out in a dark comfortableroom, designed specifically for that purpose, if you are not able to relax dur-ing the course of your day to day life? Participants learn how to use noise,light and posture to help them relax, even under very difficult circumstances.Day 3 (Sunday) : these exercises, designed to improve concentration anddevelop intuition, will be described in the last part of this book."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 142Individual and group therapyCourses on mental dynamics are always taught to groups of people, andonly rarely to individuals. The techniques are much easier to put into prac-tice in a group context, rather than on your own, using an instruction manual,no matter how detailed and well written it may be. After experimenting withall kinds of communication techniques (video, printed material, computernetworking, etc.) I am convinced that the best approach by far is that of per-sonal, hands-on instruction in a group setting.For example, I worked as a consultant for the first worldwide producerof training programs. The courses, which were very well conceived, weretaped on audio and video cassettes, designed for home use by individuals.After a short time, however, I gave up on the technique. No matter howmotivated people who bought the courses were, they were not able to fullyexploit them on their own. It’s a little like a family investing in an expensiveset of encyclopedias - after some initial interest the books, which are crammedwith fascinating material, sit on the shelf gathering dust. The only thing theyprovide their owners with is a sense of security! Maybe you have some bookslying around the house that you’ve never read. And even if you have readthem, how practical have they been? How often have you found yourselfapplying what you learned in books to your day to day life?I hope that some readers do succeed in practicing some of the exercisesdescribed in this book on their own. They will, however, be exceptions to therule. Mental dynamics cannot be effectively taught outside of a group set-ting. Audio or video cassettes, although useful for reviewing material andtechniques, cannot replace what you learn as part of a group.As the Chinese proverb says, “The lantern of experience illuminates onlythe person carrying it.”Transmitting experience outside of a group setting, where the intimateatmosphere, personal contact and potential for emulation all combine to fa-cilitate teaching, is a very difficult thing to do. In the field of psychotherapy,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 143for example, the group setting has all but replaced individual therapy. Thesame applies to personal development.Mental Dynamics - the discovery of selfFor many scientists, the rapid application of recent discoveries is a newphenomenon. Until now, it has generally taken about twenty years before adiscovery became widely used. Fortunately times have changed. By workingtogether, people who have come into contact with mental dynamics are help-ing us reach an ever wider audience. Some have even begun teaching thetechnique themselves.The task ahead - making mental dynamics an integral part of our educa-tion system - is arduous. We have to train as many instructors as we can, andincrease the number of alpha seminars we offer each year. We believe theeffort is worthwhile, as it will help society achieve a new balance. Mentaldynamics can act as a counterweight to the stress and tension that are under-mining both the mental and physical health of so many people, and helpthose same people get in touch with the happiness and tranquillity that al-ready exists in their inner selves. An ancient Hindu legend provides us witha good illustration of what lies ahead:“There was a time when all people were gods. But they abused their di-vine status so much that Brahma, supreme among all the gods, decided todeprive them of their divine power and hide it in a place where they’d neverbe able to find it. The problem was deciding where to hide it.“The minor divinities were assembled to find a solution. ‘Let us buryman’s divinity deep in the earth,’ they suggested. But Brahma replied, ‘No,that will not work. Man, being ingenious, will dig until he finds it again.’“The gods thought some more and then said, ‘Why not throw into thedeepest ocean?’ But once again Brahma rejected the idea. ‘No, sooner or laterman will explore the depths of all the oceans and will be certain to find thepower once again.’"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Alpha SeminarPage 144The minor divinities were at a loss. ‘We don’t know where to hide it,since it seems that man will look everywhere on land and in the sea, and besure to find it one day.’“Then Brahma said, ‘Here is what we will do with man’s divinity: we’llhide it in the deepest part of his own self, since that is the place he will neverthink of looking.’“Since then, says the legend, man has explored the entire world, from thehighest mountains to the deepest oceans, in search of something that can befound only in the self.” (Adapted from Eric Butterworth’s Discovering ThePower of Self).Faith healers, pendulums, amulets, fetishes... all are merely crutches. Thereal secret lies buried in your own self. Teaching this truth to as many peopleas possible, and giving them the means to experience their own divine na-ture firsthand, is the primary objective of mental dynamics."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Part Three: Parapsychology“Parapsychology is the demonstration and experimental studyof psychological functions that have not yet been incorporatedinto the present system of scientific psychology, with the aim ofeventually enlarging the scope of the present system toincorporate these phenomena.”Robert Amadou"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 146 Caslant’s Method ofDeveloping ParanormalFaculties“In order to fly at the speed of thought to any destination youchoose, you have to start by believing that you have alreadyarrived.”Richard BachHow to develop paranormal facultiesThe question of how to develop paranormal faculties has preoccupiedmankind since the dawn of time. It has acquired an added urgency in light ofthe gradual awakening of man’s awareness that has taken place over the lastfew years.The New Scientist, a British scientific journal, questioned its readers - theelite of the scientific and intellectual community - on whether or not theybelieved in the existence of extra sensorial perception (ESP). To the editor’sgreat surprise, 70% of those who were surveyed claimed that they believedESP does, in fact, exist. This trend was amplified by the publication in the1960’s of the work of Leonid L. Vassiliev on suggestion over distances. Aftersome initial resistance on the part of Soviet officials, a scientific commissionunder the directorship of A.S. Popov (called the ‘bio-information section ofthe scientific and technical inter-union society of radio technology and electro-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 147communication,’ referred to as the Popov Commission for short) was offi-cially established to pursue the study of telepathy and related subjects.Between 1966 and 1969, extensive research on ESP was carried out inmany eastern European countries. Two American journalists published thefindings of these studies in a book entitled ‘Amazing Parapsychological Discov-eries in the USSR.’ The book became the center of a storm of controversy in theU.S. NASA, which was already studying what it called ‘electromagnetic com-munication between living organisms,’ redoubled its efforts to outdo the So-viets, the rivalry between the two super powers serving to accelerate furtherresearch. About twenty universities established departments for the study ofparapsychology. The Maimonides Medical Center in New York set up a dreamlaboratory where parapsychological phenomena occurring during sleep orunder hypnosis were studied. The Advanced Research Projects Agency, abranch of the Pentagon, was granted a research contract in collaboration withStanford University to study paranormal phenomena.Since then the United States has slowly but surely caught up to the Rus-sians in the area of paranormal research, leaving other countries far behind.In France, for example, the International Metaphysical Institute, for manyyears the only officially recognized public organization set up to study para-normal phenomena, now subsists on donations from an American founda-tion.Most studies on the subject of parapsychology set out to prove that para-normal faculties do indeed exist. Rhine, working at Duke University, spent40 years of his life trying to do just that. Scientists have been fascinated byexceptional persons like Uri Geller and Pavel Stepaneck, and have subjectedthem to an endless series of tests an attempt to find answers to the questions‘How could ESP information be transmitted?’ and ‘How is extra sensorialperception possible?’Most researchers have come up with a blank when trying to find a scien-tific basis for this type of transmission. According to Vassiliev, and based on30 years of study, ESP information does not take the form of electromagneticwaves. What form does it take then? As Warren Weaver, a mathematician"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 148remarked, “I find this subject so intellectually uncomfortable it’s almost painfulto discuss!”Focussing on the question of how ESP works, researchers all but ignoredanother, equally important aspect of the issue - how can we develop our para-normal faculties?Pavel Stepaneck was taught to develop his innate powers by his teacher,Milan Ryzl. Uri Geller shrugs off insinuations of contact with some sort ofextraterrestrial force, and explains clearly how he proceeds when using hisparanormal faculties. A number of other persons have been able to developtheir own paranormal faculties by following his instructions.Interestingly enough, the methods used today are more or less the sameas those which were being discussed at the turn of the century, described bypeople like P.C. Jagot and E. Caslant.Extra-sensorial communicationFirst let’s take a look at the various ways extra-sensorial communicationcould be established between two brains (see the diagram below).Since there is, as yet, no terminology to describe the possible modes ofextra-sensorial communication, the best we can do is offer a description ofeach of the diagrams.Figure 1 - Simple communication from subconscious to subconscious.Proof of the existence of this type of communication was obtained bystudying sets of twins: two sets of twins were able to mutually induce thealpha state - as soon as one twin closed his eyes and began emitting alphareadings on an EEG, the other twin’s readings became identical. This is par-ticularly interesting, since emitting alpha waves with your eyes open is verydifficult to do.Figure 2 - Communication with feedback from subconscious to sub-conscious"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 149A refinement of the first technique, this faculty comes into play whenparanormal faculties are directed at problem solving.Figure 3 - Communication from subconscious to subconscious, whichpasses the threshold of consciousness in one of the subjectsPhenomena like intuition, sympathy or antipathy fall into this category.Figure 4 - One person makes a conscious effort to transmit informationto another person’s subconsciousThis is what happens in cases of suggestion over distances when the ob-ject of the transmission is not aware of the process, as well as in mysticalpossession, voodoo spells and so on, where negative thoughts or feelingshave an effect on the psychology and even on the physical health of anotherperson, without that person being consciously aware of the influence beingexerted.Figure 5 - One person sends a conscious message to another person,who consciously receives itSimilar to the above process, except that both parties are aware of thetransmission of information. This often happens accidentally, when you areable to read someone’s thoughts.Figure 6 - One person consciously delves into the mind of another per-son who is also aware of the processCalled double vision or clairvoyance, this faculty is easier to develop thanthose that follow, as we’ll be seeing later on.Figure 7 - One person delves into the mind of another, without the otherperson being aware of the processCommonly referred to as reading someone’s thoughts.Figure 8 - This involves two people, one of whom is called the recipi-ent, since he or she receives the message being transmittedOne person makes a conscious effort to send a message, while the otherconcentrates and tries to receive it (the transmission is effected in one direc-tion only)."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 150Figure 9 - Two persons make a conscious effort to communicate (trans-mission is effected in both directions)This refers to true ESP, the ability to communicate mentally.The diagrams are arranged in order of increasing difficulty, and showwhy scientists studying parapsychological phenomena had so much troubleat first: they focussed on the last, and most difficult aspect of ESP communi-cation (this aspect has also become more or less redundant since the inven-tion of the telephone!). Concentrating on faculties like intuition and doublevision would have been more spectacular as well as much more useful.To complete the picture we should take a look at the possible modes ofcommunication, which correspond to the signaling systems studied by Pavlov:• Words: this is the most difficult mode for ESP transmission, probably becausethe brain’s sophisticated language center has to be short-circuited, so to speak,in order for communication to take place.• Images: this mode allows for endless possibilities of transmission; it is easy touse and generally works much better than words.• Sensations: more primitive than images, sensations are even easier to transmitthan images, which is why Marcotte based his system of communication overdistances on sensations, calling his technique telesthesia.Depending on an individual’s personality, one or another form of com-munication will be easier to perceive. Because modern man has, to a greatdegree, lost touch with his own inner sensations, the transmission of imagesgenerally provides the best results in ESP experiments.Of course all three modes of communication can be used at the sametime, which is what the Russian researcher K.D. Kotrov, a pupil of ProfessorPlatanov, tried to do in his experiments on suggestion over distances:"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 151“I would get comfortable on a couch in a relatively soundproof room,close my eyes and whisper the words I was trying to suggest, while concen-trating on my subject. ‘Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.’ I called this the first phase of men-tal suggestion.“During the second phase I formed a mental image of the subject in mymind, trying to make it as intense and clear as an hallucination or a dreamimage. In my mind I imagined my subject in a state of deep sleep, eyes closed.“The third phase, which I call the volition phase, is most important. Iwould concentrate all my willpower on getting the subject to fall asleep, andat a given moment this desire would be transformed into a certitude, with anaccompanying feeling of ecstatic triumph or success.”Caslant’s methodAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Eugene Caslant published asmall book entitled ‘Method For The Development of Paranormal Faculties.’Caslant’s talent lay in being able extract a clear, effective and simplemethod from the huge body of literature on occult sciences which existed atthe time, a method that is being rediscovered by modern researchers. Theaccuracy of his remarks, combined with his vast personal experience, hasmade the book a classic of its genre, which is why it is still being used as aguide today.A former science student, Caslant decided to weed out all religious orphilosophical interpretations in his study of the paranormal, and approachthe subject from a purely scientific point of view. Through observation, ex-perimentation and the creation of instruments capable of measuring paran-ormal phenomena, Caslant hoped to establish laws that were verifiable andaccessible to all. He also tried to offer an hypothesis that not only explainedparanormal phenomena, but revealed new facts about the subject as well.The paranormal faculties he concentrated on included:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 152• Clairvoyance or double vision: The conscious ability to form a clear mentalpicture of a distant place or scene which the subject has no prior knowledge ofwhatsoever, or to read another person’s thoughts, or the ability to discern thecharacter or intentions of another person, completely unknown to the subject,without relying on any auditory or visual stimulation.• Premonitory or retrospective vision: The ability to describe events which tookplace in the distant past, or depict scenes which would take place in the future.Caslant himself called these faculties supranormal instead of paranor-mal, for the following reasons: “The word paranormal, taken from the Greek‘para’ meaning beside, implies that these phenomena are rare and in someway abnormal. Thus, many people tend to associate parapsychology withparapathology, considering persons who devote themselves to the study ofthe paranormal as being pathological. In other words, such persons are moreor less crazy. And in fact, many so-called mentally ill persons have experi-ences which closely resemble what we call clairvoyance or the mental trans-mission of thoughts. Their disease seems to act as a catalyst, stimulating thedevelopment of new faculties, unfortunately at the expense of their mentalstability.“Inversely, so-called normal persons who live through a paranormal ex-perience tend to minimize its importance by ignoring it completely, or refus-ing to talk about it, for fear of being labeled crazy.“In fact, experience and practical tests have convinced me, beyond theshadow of a doubt, that all persons possess these faculties in a latent state.For that reason, they are neither paranormal or abnormal, but completelynormal.”Caslant also believed that, in addition to our subconscious mind, we alsopossess a super-conscious mind which controls supranormal faculties. Thispart of the mind can provide us with information via our imagination, in theform of subjective thoughts which we all have, without knowing where theycome from."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 153“After all,” Caslant goes on to theorize, “what is imagination? Well, imagi-nation could be described as the ability to perceive interior images. And whatare these interior images? They are the memories of groups of elementarysensations.”The process works something like this: various stimuli, in the form ofparticles or electromagnetic waves of a certain wavelength, produce sensa-tions in the human mind. These sensations are registered by our brain cells.Although they may be forgotten, they are never completely destroyed. Theycan reappear, usually with less intensity than the original sensations, with-out the need of a stimulus. These are our memories. A group of sensationsconstitute a mental image. Our subconscious mind acts as a kind of store-house for mental images, which are then associated by their affinity for oneanother.“Since our impressions are, to some extent, common to other persons, itcan happen that our subconscious stores images drawn from the minds ofother individuals.”Acting as a kind of bridge between two subconscious minds, images can,on occasion, and under certain conditions, be used to draw information fromthe subconscious mind of another person. Since the brain acts as both a senderand a receiver, images can be of two kinds: emitted and received. There arealso two kinds of imagination - active and passive.Here’s what Caslant has to say about active imagination, the vehicle ofhuman mental activity, controlling functions like thought, comprehension,invention and memory:“If we could understand the laws governing active imagination and knewhow to apply them, we could cure disease without medicine, transform ourselves and make miracles come true.”The basis of his method is the activation of passive imagination, followedby the gradual elimination of all active imagination. Whether produced byactive or passive imagination, an image is always linked to the one preceding"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 154it (Jung studied the same phenomenon, calling it association) In order to pro-duce a passive image that is not linked to its preceding image, Caslant usedan instructor who would suggest the new image.Developing supranormal faculties takes two people: a subject and an in-structor or guide. Instructors use their voice as the means of induction. “Thesubject gets comfortable, with eyes covered to block out any ambient light.The instructor then guides the subject towards a state of inner calm by sug-gesting an image - a calm lake at sunset, an endless plain of swaying grassstretching all the way to the horizon, etc.”It is unfortunate that Caslant had no opportunity to study sophrology,since the images he tried to evoke in his subjects are similar to those whicharise in dreams, or better still when the brain is in a state between wakingand sleep, either before falling asleep at night, or just after waking up in themorning, i.e. during the alpha state.When subjects have attained this particular state, instructors repeat a singleword a couple of times, asking what sensations, if any, the word evokes.There are three possible results: either nothing happens, or the wordevokes a memory, or it evokes some new, completely unknown image.In the first case, i.e. if nothing happens, it is likely that the subject is pre-occupied with some problem or other. The instructor should do whatever isnecessary to break the subject’s immediate train of thought, either by sug-gesting other words, asking the subject to recall a familiar image, or invitingthe subject to be creative and come up with a new image on his own.In the second case, i.e. if the word evokes a memory, more words shouldbe suggested until a new image arises. If no new images arise, Caslant sug-gests that instructors guide their subjects through a series of imagined ac-tions. If, for example, a subject forms an image of a car, the instructor couldsuggest that he get into the car and start driving. This will inevitably producenew, unknown images, which is the aim of the exercise."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 155Two problems can then arise:• The subject reverts back to active images which take the form of projections ofpersonal problems. When this happens, subjects become introspective and startdoubting the validity of their subjective impressions. They start elaboratingrational hypotheses which short-circuit their passive imagination. This is whythe instructor’s attitude is so important. An instructor should always be reas-suring in order to boost a subject’s confidence. A strong sense of empathy anda fertile imagination are also necessary.• The subject cannot concentrate on the image that is evoked. Instead, the imageappears like a flash of light and then vanishes, leaving only a fleeting memory.If this happens the instructor should tell the subject to try and recall the image,and then ask specific questions: What make of car was it? What color was thecar? What color did it appear to be to you? What season of the year was it?What feeling did you get from the weather? And so on.Note that it is better for an instructor to ask about feelings and impres-sions rather than saying, What kind of car do you think it was? or What sea-son do you think it was? This is because passive imagination and intuitiondepend much more on feelings and impressions than on rational thoughts,which are more closely related to active imagination. Thinking will simplysummon up the bank of data already stored in the person’s subconscious.Subjects should not be allowed to get lost in thought. Instructors shouldbe constantly stimulating their subject’s passive imagination by asking ques-tions, without trying to anticipate the answers, which is why it is so impor-tant to train them properly. An instructor should know how to regain controlof an induction session when a subject’s active imagination is in the processof taking over, using what is called a maieutic approach (based on the Socratictechnique of helping a subject bring forth or become aware of his or her la-tent ideas or memories).Clairvoyance or double vision"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 156This faculty, although relatively easy to develop, is nonetheless quiteamazing.“The main advantage of this exercise is to provide undeniable evidenceof the existence of supranormal faculties. Skeptics who observe an inductionsession, and who are then able to verify the accuracy of a place or scene de-scribed by a subject who has had no opportunity of gaining any firsthandknowledge of it, and which may be located thousands of miles away, areobliged to shed their incredulity and accept the phenomenon as fact.”Caslant may have been slightly optimistic when he said that, skepticismbeing like a weed with many roots - it tends to reappear even after you thinkit has been completely destroyed. The reasons confirmed skeptics come upwith to try and explain what cannot rationally be explained never cease toamaze me. When they are reminded of the facts, they may relent, at least forawhile, but in a short time their skepticism gets the better of them again,forming a distorted picture of what actually took place in their mind.Fortunately this kind of extreme skepticism, which resembles a patho-logical state of mind, is fairly rare. Two or three sessions of double vision orclairvoyance, carried out under the strictest scientific conditions, are gener-ally enough to convince such people that the phenomenon does indeed exist.Caslant suggested that some kind of connecting thread or transitionmechanism is necessary to evoke the desired images.“If, for example, I want a subject to visualize the office of a certain Mr. X,whom he does not know, but whom I am acquainted with, I would first tellhim to concentrate on me, and then, through me, on Mr. X, then on Mr. X’shouse, and finally on his office.”My own experience leads me to believe that this kind of transition mecha-nism is not necessary. Once a subject’s faculties of visualization and passiveimagination are well developed, all he or she needs is a name or a word,situated in time and space, in order to ‘see’ the desired object. For example, ifI ask a subject to describe Mr. P., 45 years old, living in Mexico City, even"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 157though I myself have never met the man, he will immediately be able to doso, on condition that he has no doubts about his paranormal abilities, that heis in an alpha state, and that he has undergone proper training. The informa-tion I provide him with will elicit an image, without any need for a transitionmechanism. All I can say is that perhaps Caslant used transitions as filters, inorder to gradually eliminate normal phenomena linked to active imagina-tion.The quality of double vision descriptionsThe quality of a double vision description depends solely on the verbalskills and cultural sophistication the subject. Subjects can, over time, learn toimprove their imaging perceptions to the point where they feel unable toclearly express what they see or feel in words. And, in fact, words are oftenan inadequate tool for describing the subtleties of human emotions. Extrasensorial perception (often perceived as feelings) is also a very subtle form ofcommunication, akin to that of Pavlov’s first system of communication, whichresists being translated into the second system, i.e. words.A subject may be experiencing feelings or sensations on a physiologicallevel, as if they were quite real. It is almost as if the brain were playing withthe body, like a musician playing an instrument.That is why experiments like those conducted by Edgar Cayce are easierto accomplish than the extra sensorial transmission of words. Death and in-jury provoke such vivid sensations that they often result in cases of sponta-neous telepathy. Illness and pain are also capable of provoking vivid mentalimages, which are easy to ‘capture’ because they express such powerful sen-sations.Tuning in to the physical or mental state of a person in distress is an ex-cellent way to develop a subject’s empathy, sympathy and powers of telepa-thy. Subjects actually share in another person’s suffering, if only for a fewmoments. They have the impression of actually becoming someone else for ashort time."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 158When an instructor asks what is causing the disease (sometimes asking isnot even necessary), a subject is able to find the physical and / or psychologi-cal causes of the illness. In other words subjects are able to draw informationfrom the subconscious mind of another person. In addition, they have accessto information which the sick person himself might not be consciously awareof. This is one of the most interesting aspects of double vision. If you reallywant to help someone, gaining a supranormal understanding of their prob-lem can provide extraordinary insight into both the cause of the problem,and possible cures. Caslant was close to discovering this potential when hesaid, “I have seen countless cases where a subject has described someone’spersonality more accurately than the person would be able to do himself!”Unfortunately, Caslant went on to say that... “double vision is the easiestsupranormal faculty to develop, and at the same time the least interesting,compared to other forms. It may have its practical applications, but in noway increases our knowledge, since it does not provide us with anythingthat cannot be obtained in other ways.”Had Caslant lived a little longer, he may have changed his opinion aboutdouble vision. I have seen many instances where the technique has been usedto shed new light on how to treat disease, especially when the sufferer is aclose relation or friend. As you may know, disease is often the physical mani-festation of some kind of inner revolt, some deep feeling of frustration oranger. Discovering the underlying cause of a health problem will inevitablyaccelerate the healing process.The power of a nameI have always been amazed by the power of names. Mention any name,any one of the billions of names on the planet, and someone’s entire existencefloods the mind of a clairvoyant subject. Tibetan monks keep their real namessecret, in order to prevent their enemies from harming them.A telephone company did a survey of which word was most frequentlyused by people during conversation. The winner by far was the word “I.” Tome, the word I refers to a name, Christian Godefroy. If someone mentions my"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 159name, even faintly, I will hear it. My name is engraved in my subconscious.The sound or image of my name will evoke more associations in my subcon-scious mind than any other name or word, with the exception of “I.” So it isno wonder that the suggestion of a name to a clairvoyant subject evokes suchintense imagery.Some names are problematical. Take the case of women - should we use awoman’s maiden name, or married name? I have had good results with both.Often using a maiden name elicits images that are less precise. I have eventried to trick subjects by using only the first and second names of a person,but without success - subjects were able to tune in to their targeted persondespite the fact that they were not provided with completely accurate infor-mation. I sometimes even changed a name completely, inventing a wholenew name. Subjects would sometimes form an image of the person, but itwould be inaccurate. In most cases, providing a false name resulted in com-plete failure.Premonitory or retrospective visionIf there is one paranormal faculty that shakes the foundation of what weconsider to be common sense, it is that of premonition. Time conditions ourlives and our being. We cannot go back in time, and trying to do so has re-mained the dream of creators of fiction. Being able to predict the future is oneof the great preoccupations of humankind, an enigma that has yet to be solved.On the other hand, chance is not always what it seems. A few years ago Ibecame associated with D.P., a man of about fifty, who suggested we becomebusiness partners. I took him at his word, and invested in the enterprise heproposed. A few months later the business was bankrupt. A friend of mine, alawyer, remarked that there was nothing surprising about our failure. “Whatdid your partner accomplish in his fifty years of life? Nothing. His privatelife was a shambles, his wife had left him and his children didn’t want to seehim. His professional reputation left a lot to be desired. Why should this newventure have ended in anything but failure as well?”"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 160My partner, it seems, was guided by the same mental conditioning thathad caused him to fail in the past. If I had been able to detect the images offailure programmed into his subconscious, I could have predicted what wouldhappen beforehand. If we accept that people who succeed have a clear men-tal picture of what they want to attain, then predicting the future becomes amatter of becoming aware of these subconscious images, organizing theminto some kind of comprehensible system, and then forming a portrait of thefuture based on those images which are most likely to materialize.“Mediums never see the future as something that is already determined,which is why their predictions are often at least partially erroneous. A pre-diction should be considered more as a probability than as the gospel truth.”Imagine yourself sitting in a darkened room, facing a woman who is hold-ing your hands. She is a medium. To your great amazement, she has beentelling you things about yourself that she could not possibly have known orlearned from anyone else. Being a skilled amateur psychologist, she is able tofill in the gaps in her mental picture of you through astute observation ofyour features, hands, clothes, etc., and from the little you told her about your-self. She starts talking about your future. “I see you ...”Whatever image she describes will have a profound impact on your mind.Your subconscious will register the image, and become more or less obsessedwith it. After what we learned about psychocybernetics, we should not besurprised to see this image transformed into reality. If a medium tells a youngwoman she is going to marry a blond man, she will quite naturally start seek-ing out blond men, although she may not be aware of what she is doing. Ifyou have ever bought a new car, you know how you start focussing on carsof the same make while you’re driving, in order to compare them to yourown. The brain selects information from the mass of data it receives, empha-sizing those aspects which resonate with pre-existing cerebral circuits.Mythology is filled with stories of people’s destiny being fulfilled de-spite all their efforts to prevent it. Take Alexander the Great as an example. Awise man told him that he would kill his own father. In a rage, Alexanderthrew the man off the top of a tower. The prophecy was fulfilled - the old seer"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 161was, in fact, Alexander’s own father. The subconscious conditioning to killhis father was stronger than his conscious denial, and thus came to pass.In my opinion, believing that everything is predestined is simply confus-ing cause with effect. I prefer to condition my future, to program it instead oftrying to divine what it already is. I don’t want a single image to influencemy entire life. And, in fact, I have no need of knowing my future, because byusing the mental tools we’ve been discussing in this book, I can actually con-trol it.When we talk about the future, intuition becomes extremely important.It guides us on our way, and the more developed it is, the better it is able towork for us, which is why Caslant’s exercises on premonition are so impor-tant. Intuition can help us create our future, and delve into the past.The faculty of post-cognition is easier to develop than premonition.“Visions of the past are easier to obtain because they concern events thathave already taken place - their composing images are definitively associ-ated.”An induction session begins the same way as the one described above.But instead of letting images arise spontaneously, subjects are told to focuson a single image.“Subjects should concentrate as completely as possible and then drawimages from their memory, as if they were trying to summon up a scene theythemselves had experienced, or as if they were watching a scene unfold fromsome distance.”Guides should start by asking a series of questions, pushing a subject’smemory to the limit. Then, by insisting on more answers, and suggestingthat the subject let his or her passive imagination take over, more images andimpressions arise that shed new light on the object of investigation."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 162“Premonition works in much the same way, except that subjects are nottold to concentrate on some past event, observing it from a distance, but areinstead instructed to move forward in time. Guides help their subjects bygrouping images, directing their attention to various aspects of the imagesthat arise, and keeping them on track by reviewing these different points ofview, until subjects are eventually able to control their own passive imagery.The way subjects are guided through an induction session is extremely im-portant, as far as the validity of the premonition is concerned.”As is the case with double vision, images are often vague and inconsis-tent. Subjects may try to analyze their sensations but, according to Caslant,“... any effort that is made will change the existing image.” As soon as asubject’s conscious will is brought into play, his or her paranormal facultiesare inhibited.The impressions that arise each time I practice these exercises myself iscomparable to what happens when I watch a film: I am no longer in controlof the images that arise. They seem to take on a life of their own. I can de-scribe them, I can try to observe them as closely as possible, but I often get thefeeling that my guide has more control over them than I do. One of the majorproblems I have is that I feel I am being used, that I’m simply the plaything ofmy guide’s imagination. Even now, after so many sessions, I still feel ashamedabout some of the things I am tempted to say during an induction session.Sometimes I don’t dare describe an image. As I learned to overcome my hesi-tation and speak out, I often found that these images are the most accurate ofall.For example, when asked to describe the past of a person named DanielF., I felt pain in my left hand, and described a scene that my guide realizedwas a handball court. I had never played handball in my life, nor seen a hand-ball court. I didn’t want to talk about the pain, which was causing my handto contract. But realizing that hiding anything would make the exercise fu-tile, I finally mentioned it to my guide. A few days later I learned that theyoung man had fractured his left hand while playing handball."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 163Some subjects, notably women, do not feel the need to analyze the im-ages that arise in their passive imagination. Their is no duality of conscious-ness, no regret or criticism of what they spontaneously imagine. Once theimage is created, they get so deeply involved in the situation that they maycome out of a session feeling completely drained. During the session itself,they may cry out or experience intense emotions, as if they were actuallyliving the situation themselves.Caslant was emphatic about the importance of a subject’s intentions. Ifthey were pure, disinterested and altruistic, all would go well. If they weretainted by self interest or disdain, paranormal faculties would automaticallybe inhibited.I also noticed how a guide’s intentions can disrupt an induction session.If the guide intends to use information acquired during the session for harm-ful purposes, then communication cannot be established. If a guide is notreally concerned about whether a subject succeeds or not, a sense of disinter-est will be transmitted to the subject, whose images will be weak and impre-cise.Caslant suggests that if subjects are personally involved in a situation,i.e. when the issue being investigated concerns them personally, they are morelikely to become preoccupied with their own subconscious thoughts, insteadof concentrating on their supraconscious images.SummaryA well trained guide can help you develop your supranormal faculties.Although passive images may, at first, be vague and imprecise compared toactual memories, they will soon become just as sharp and clear. All it takes isa little practice. Depending on a subject’s temperament and previous condi-tioning, clear images may arise during an initial induction session. In mostcases, however, it takes a few sessions before they appear.Guides should proceed as follows during all induction sessions:"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Caslant’s MethodPage 164a) Help the subject attain a state of mental and physical calm.b) Elicit an image formed by the subject’s passive imagination.c) Ask questions while preventing the subject’s conscious mind from interfering(no criticism, no holding back).d)Note down all responses, or tape the entire session.e) Always do your best to help your subject - your intention is just as importantas your skill.f) Be very careful about how you bring your subject back out of the alpha state.“You should be just as careful about how you bring subjects out of thealpha state as you are about getting them in. If this step is not accomplishedproperly, subjects may suffer from fatigue, dizziness and various circulationproblems, especially if they are very sensitive and imaginative, or if they triedto work without a guide.”Caslant suggests a very gradual withdrawal from the alpha state, usingtechniques like visualizing the self and practicing conscious control of bodilymovements, respiration, etc.Robert Desoille, one of Caslant’s students, developed a method of psy-chotherapy based on his teacher’s method. Called Controlled Waking DreamTherapy, a guide helps patients interpret the symbolism in their dreams. Thetechnique has provided excellent results, helping patients overcome their in-hibitions and enabling them to talk openly about their problems.Given that one of the requirements for developing supranormal facultiesis entering a state somewhere between waking and sleep so that subjects be-come aware of their mental imagery, and given that this state is especiallyconducive to stimulating passive imagination, it is fortunate that there is atime when each and every one of us has the privilege of attaining that verystate of consciousness.That particular state - the dream state - is the subject of our next chapter."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 165Dreaming: AParapsychologicalPhenomenonSleep on it!A survey of spontaneous parapsychological phenomena found that overtwo thirds of reported cases took the form of dreams, with the other thirdoccurring during the waking state.In fact, sleep is very conducive for this type of experience: at certain phasesof the sleep cycle the brain produces a predominance of alpha waves, theneo-cortex is inactive and subconscious mental imagery is stimulated. An-cient stories, like those found in the Bible and Homer’s Iliad, often refer topersons having premonitory dreams. Let’s take a quick look at what we knowabout sleep and dreams.A dream could be defined as a series of psychic phenomena producedduring sleep. This means that dreaming is closely linked to sleep. During theperiods immediately preceding and following sleep, conscious mental activ-ity continues. It may be more or less active, more or less clear, but it doescontinue.Interestingly enough, and contrary to what most people think, some de-gree of mental activity continues even while we sleep. In the same way that itis very difficult to stop thinking while we are awake, it is also difficult - if notimpossible - to completely stop mental activity while we are sleeping."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 166Everyone dreamsFor a long time it was believed that some people dream while others donot. As the study of psychology became more scientific, it was discoveredthat all people dream, although some may not remember their dreams aswell as others.REM SleepREM stands for rapid eye movement. Researchers found that during cer-tain phases of sleep, people’s eyes start fluttering very rapidly even thoughthey remain closed. Movements of the eyeballs can be horizontal or vertical.In addition, researchers found that REM sleep is characterized by the pro-duction of more alpha and beta waves by the brain, while ordinary sleepproduces more theta and delta waves (having a slower frequency). This maysound like a paradox, since beta waves are characteristic of the waking state,while alpha waves are usually produced during a state between waking andsleep.It was soon discovered that REM phases corresponded to periods of in-tense dream activity. Dement and Kletman showed that by waking peopleup immediately following a REM phase, it was possible to obtain very clearand precise accounts of their dreams. Waking people up when they were notin a REM phase often left them with no recollection of their dreams whatso-ever.Based on these findings, it was easy to jump to the conclusion that peopledream only during REM phases. Further study, however, proved that this isnot the case.A continual spectacleWhole or fragmented dreams, disjointed images and thoughts, feelingsand bits of memories fill our minds continually while we sleep, even betweenREM phases. Although REM phases are accompanied by intense physiologi-cal activity, which may be why it is easier to remember dreams that occur"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 167during those periods, they are by no means the only times we dream. Thefact that we recall REM dreams is simply due to the fact that our consciousmind is more active than during other, deeper periods of sleep.Sleep phasesHere’s what happens during a normal night’s sleep:You start by emitting alpha waves, during that period of reverie that pre-cedes actual sleep. If you are dead tired, this phase may only last a few sec-onds. Under normal circumstances, however, it lasts about ten minutes. Yourbrain gradually starts producing waves with a slower wavelength - mainlytheta and delta waves. Then, about every 82 minutes, you start producingfaster waves, for a period that gradually increases in duration - about 5 to 10minutes during the early part of sleep, and up to half an hour during thelatter part. These are your REM phases. As the hours go by, you start emerg-ing from deep sleep, so that by the time you wake up you are almost in awaking state.82 minutes - a biological cycleI have often thought that people listening to a speaker or watching a movieare very much like dreamers - they need a break every 80 minutes or so,during which they can work off some of the excess energy they have accu-mulated by sitting still and concentrating on the same subject (doing somegymnastics instead of having a coffee or drinking alcohol is an excellent wayto work off excess tension). Whenever this unspoken rule is broken, mem-bers of an audience become restless and distracted. I am sure that companiescould increase their staff’s productivity dramatically by allowing them totake an ‘active’ break every hour and a half or so. The way things stand,workers have to rely on excuses like going to the bathroom or making a per-sonal phone call in order to stay in tune with their biological cycle.Everybody dreams, but most of us only remember a small fraction ofwhat we dream, notably images that arise during REM phases. Why is it,"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 168then, that some people can’t seem to remember their dreams at all? What canthey do to start remembering?How to remember your dreamsWhen you get into bed, start by relaxing your entire body, from your toesright up to the top of your head. This will put you into an alpha state. Thenrepeat a few positive formulations: ‘I want to remember one of my dreams...I can remember one of my dreams... tomorrow, when I wake up, I will havea perfect recollection of one of my dreams.’ If you still have problems, addthis formulation: ‘I have the right to remember my dreams!’ and repeat itmentally a few times, with conviction, as if you were a union negotiator de-manding fair wages from an employer. You could accompany the formula-tion with a visualization of yourself, waking up in the morning, writing yourdream down in a notebook. It is important to generate a feeling of ease andsatisfaction as your mind creates the visualization. Next morning, when youwake up, avoid anything that tends to stimulate beta activity - opening youreyes, thinking about the time, moving around, and so on. Just lie still and tryto remember your dream. An image will rise, followed by another, and soona scene will unfold, probably with you as the main character. Only after youhave recalled the entire dream should you sit up and start writing it down.Later on you can modify the formulation to include many dreams in-stead of just one.FormulationsPositive formulations are more or less the same thing as suggestions madeunder self hypnosis. We prefer the term formulation simply because the wordhypnosis is burdened with a number of negative connotations(Caycedo coinedthe terms sophrology and terpnos logos for the same reasons). A participantat an alpha seminar phrased it well: “Words like autosuggestion and self hyp-nosis are outdated and somehow childish. I like the term positive formula-tion because it’s new and positive.”"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 169Dreaming: a journey into the subconsciousPsychoanalysts base a large part of their study of the subconscious mindon dream analysis. They interpret symbols expressed in dreams in order tolearn how patients may be compensating for their psychological problems,and what kinds of behavior they may be suppressing. There is no denyingthe importance of dreams. On the other hand, it is wrong to limit their impor-tance to Freudian analysis. Freud himself wrote about the telepathic relation-ship existing between patient and analyst in an essay entitled Psychoanalysisand Telepathy. One of the ways this relationship is expressed is through dreams- patients often dream about their analysts, and vice versa. As many psychia-trists will agree, making a study of the mind’s images is a good way to stimu-late telepathic communication.Drs. M. Ullman and S. Krippner of the Miamonides Hospital Dream Labo-ratory in New York were intrigued by the phenomenon. In one instance apatient reported dreaming about a cat, alcohol and fresh cream. Ullman wasamazed - the night before he had attended a class and observed an experi-ment in which a cat, which had been conditioned to become alcoholic, pre-ferred alcohol to fresh cream.The Dream Laboratory : Telepathy while you sleepIn an attempt to prove that telepathic communication is enhanced dur-ing REM phases of sleep, a series of experiments were conducted. They turnedout to be very thought provoking. One experiment concerned the transmis-sion of images depicting New York city, chosen from a collection of paintingsat the New York Museum. 72 paintings were chosen for their intense colorsand emotional content. Each reproduction was sealed in an opaque enve-lope. Subjects worked in groups of two. An agent would be given a paintingat random. Agents were placed in an isolated chamber and told to concen-trate on the image while their partner was asleep, and especially during REMphases.When the sleeping partner woke up, he or she would recount his dreamsto an impartial observer, who would judge how closely they resembled the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 170painting in question. Distortions were reported in some cases, but a majorityof subjects provided extremely accurate, and sometimes even perfect descrip-tions.For a painting by Dali called The Sacrament of the Eucharist, the subjectdreamed of a group of people, a fishing boat, lots of people eating and a glassof wine. This images correspond exactly to the elements of the painting theagent was concentrating on.In another experiment, more than two thousand persons attending a rockconcert were asked to concentrate on an image projected above the stage.The image represented a yogi, meditating in full lotus position. The subjectof the experiment dreamed about a holy man who was meditating and re-ceiving energy from the sun.Even more amazing results were obtained with a subject named MalcolmBessent, an Englishman who claimed to have frequent premonitory dreams.Bessent was awakened after each REM phase so he could describe his dreams.The next day a researcher picked a word at random out of a book, then asso-ciated it with a painting or print. For example, the word corridor was associ-ated with a painting called A Corridor in Saint Paul Hospital by Van Gogh. Thepainting shows a solitary figure standing in the cement corridor of a mentalasylum. As it happened, Bessent had twice dreamed of a cement buildingwith a sick, unhappy person trapped inside on the previous night, and hadspoken about medical personnel three times.Dreams, seances and creativityBecause dreams help us navigate through our subconscious, the symbol-ism they contain can be used to resolve psychological problems and free usfrom our inhibitions. That is what therapists who use the controlled waking-dream technique try to do.Dreams can also provides us with insights into what Jung called the col-lective unconscious, enabling us to gather information that can help resolveother types of problems, for example those associated with creativity."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 171When dreams are used to stimulate or compliment creativity, they coor-dinate, organize, associate and resolve equations which we propose to oursubconscious mind. Tartini wrote his Devil’s Sonata during a dream.Mendeleyev discovered his famous periodic table of elements while dream-ing. The idea to work on a drug to combat diabetes came to Banting in adream. The result? His discovery of insulin, which has allowed millions ofdiabetics to lead healthy normal lives. Edison, Einstein and Franklin were allin the habit of taking a short nap when they were trying to find the solutionto some problem. Voltaire and Coleridge claimed that they often woke upwith entire poems written out in their heads.Perhaps you have fallen asleep thinking about some problem or other,only to wake up with the solution you were looking for. What if you wereable to do the same thing whenever you wanted? Would you be interested inknowing how?How to solve problems in your sleepEdison was in the habit of making a list of problems he wanted to solvebefore going to bed. Every morning he’d wake up and harvest the fruit of thenight’s ideas and inventions. We can all set the paranormal and creative mecha-nisms we need to solve problems while we dream in motion. All you have todo is:1.Visualize the final result of whatever you are seeking.2.While in the alpha state, repeat the following: “Tonight my mind willsolve the problem of ... When I wake up tomorrow morning I will rememberthe solution, either in the form of a dream, or as an inspiration that will cometo me sometime during the day.”The main obstacle is not resolving a problem while you dream, but re-membering the solution. Often a thought or sensation you have while awakecan trigger a recollection of the solution you are seeking. Sometimes a fewnights sleep are needed to succeed. In some cases, a dream you had one nightwill be continued the next night, and so on, until you are able to resolve theproblem. To be able to recall information more easily, you can associate it"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 172with a gesture or some other kind of signal. Some writers can only workwhen a certain odor permeates their studio or office. Others can only work atcertain times of the day, or under certain specific conditions. In other words,their creativity depends on some associated reflex. The same applies to per-sons who can only fall asleep under certain conditions. They may need aspecial type of pillow, pure cotton sheets, have their bed facing a certain di-rection, and so on.This type of reflex-association can be set up between a signal and thework that is to be carried out while dreaming, and between the same signaland the recollection of the dream in question.For example, drink half a glass of water at night just before going to bed,and think, “This is all I have to do to find the solution I’m looking for.” Nextmorning when you wake up, drink the rest of the water and think, “This is allI have to do to remember the solution I dreamed.”Any gesture, image or phrase can be used as an associative signal.Waking up at willDoctor Hubert Larcher, in his book Realms of Parapsychology, reportsthree cases of persons able to awaken at will:“One young woman used to ask the souls in purgatory to wake her upwhen she wanted: she would fall asleep while repeating this prayer, and couldalways wake up at the exact time she wanted.“We observed a similar process in a widow who, instead of praying tosouls in purgatory, asked her deceased husband to wake her up. She neverfailed to wake up at the exact time she desired. It also seemed that her deadhusband was aware of her habit of lying around in bed after waking up,because she would always start emerging from sleep twenty minutes beforethe appointed time!"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 173“In another case, a student was able to obtain equally consistent resultssimply by doing a little self hypnosis before falling asleep. No need to pray todead souls or a departed husband. She could even program herself to wakeup a few times during the same night.”These three cases all have something in common: all three subjects per-formed some kind of subconscious programming while they were in the al-pha state, just before falling asleep. No matter what technique they used, theresults were the same. In addition, each time the technique worked, theirinitial faith in their ability to wake up at will was reinforced.Actually, there is no need to contact the dead or engage in self hypnosisin order to wake up whenever you want. All you have to do is visualize analarm clock before falling asleep. First imagine that the hands are pointing tothe actual time, and then imagine them moving around and around untilthey reach the time you want to wake up. Think, “All I have to do to wake upon time, feeling alert and refreshed, is concentrate on the image of the clock.”You can reinforce the program the following morning by saying, “Each timeI use this mental technique, it will be more accurate.”Remember that formulations must be phrased carefully. If they aren’t, ifa formulation is unacceptable or impossible to carry out, or if you really donot believe it can be carried out, the law of inverse effect will come into playand undermine your objective (in other words, you may wake up at noonwhen you had a plane to catch at 9 a.m.!). Waiting until you are in an alphastate to make your formulations will prevent this problem from occurring.And remember, the more you practice the technique, the more efficient youwill become at waking up on time.Symbols and the brainOne of the problems many people have about remembering their dreamsis the apparent irrationality of the images they recall. Scenes, people and ob-jects seem to appear without being linked in any comprehensible way."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 174I have had many people come to me with their dreams, hoping that Icould provide the key that will help them understand what their subcon-scious is trying to tell them.In fact, understanding your dreams is not as difficult as it seems. You justhave to remember that dreams are composed of symbols.The following exercise is designed to help people grasp what symbolsare. Participants are told to write down any words that come to mind afterhearing a single word chosen by an instructor. The word / stimulus shouldbe evocative (good examples are mother, thorn, milk, etc.).Here is a list of possible associations for the word mother: gentle, secure,tenderness, love, understanding, affection, feeling, blessing, God, teacher,ocean, life, child, etc.For some of these associations, the word mother is a symbol, a subjectiveimage of certain emotions or qualities. Someone else may very well come upwith a different set of associations: tyrant, anger, hard, bad, etc. But if we lookat most responses, we will find an overwhelming preponderance of positiveassociations, related to affection and love.The predominant associations would therefore represent the collectivesymbolism of the word mother. An oak tree symbolizes peace, majesty,strength and nature for most people. We have also seen how different colorstend to evoke different feelings. Although psychoanalysts can interpret dreamsin light of collective symbolism, only the dreamer himself is able to elucidatesome of the associations found in his dreams.The person who best understands the unconscious meaning of a symbolis the person who expresses it.Why are symbolic dreams often difficult to understand? Well, for onething, many associations vanish as the conscious mind starts to censure whatthe subconscious mind is trying to express. We are all inhibited in one way oranother, and our rational minds often block out potentially damaging parts"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 175of a message in order to protect our self image. Things get even more compli-cated when we realize that our subconscious mind often uses symbols to tryand express those very problems which cause us to form inhibitions. If wewant to use dreaming for creative or paranormal purposes, we have to some-how avoid the trap of censure in order to understand the symbols generatedby our own mind.Can everyone understand their dreams?Anyone who can create a dream can also understand it. It’s all a questionof habit and undoing previous conditioning.We live in a specialized world - almost every task we can imagine is car-ried out by someone who is trained for that specific job, or by a machinedesigned to replace its human counterpart. The day may come when we areno longer able to feel our own bodies, and will have to rely on machines tofeel for us. Delegating tasks to others, or placing our trust in machines maymake life easier in some ways, but it also limits the scope of our own activity.In other words we give up a little of our free will each time we allow others todo things for us. As far as our dreams are concerned, we should all learn tointerpret them ourselves, without having to ask for help from a specialist, inthis case a psychologist or psychotherapist.The process of understanding your dreams is easier than it seems.Firstly, at the same time as you program the subject of a dream, i.e. whileyou are in the alpha state just before falling asleep, add the following formu-lation : “I will understand my dream when I wake up. With each passing dayit will become easier for me to understand my dreams.”Secondly, you absolutely must write your dreams down. Keep a note-book and pen beside your bed, which you use only for that purpose. Like animage that appears gradually as you put the pieces of a puzzle together, yourunderstanding of the symbols you create in your dreams will become clearerand clearer as time goes by. A message may emerge, or some pattern that you"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 176were unable to see before. Writing your dreams down is essential, if you areto gain the necessary perspective to be able to comprehend them.Thirdly, you may be unable to interpret one or two recurring elements inyour dreams. If this happens, all you have to do is put yourself in the alphastate, and wait for an answer to arise in your mind. Caslant spoke about de-scending through various levels of consciousness. The upper levels provideyou with symbolic images, while the lower levels provide explanations, of-ten in verbal form, of those symbols. Descending means moving from objec-tive to subjective awareness, from the image itself to what it means for you.Occult rituals rely on a multitude of symbols which are supposed tochange our state of mind, and help us attain altered states of consciousness.Tarot cards, for example, are a collection of symbols designed to modify oursubconscious associations.Unfortunately, symbolism changes as humans evolve. Many of the sym-bols used by ancient occult masters like the Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus,founder of the so-called hermetic sciences, or Hebrew Cabalists, are no longercomprehensible to us. Instead of trying to unlock the mysteries of ancientsymbols and recreate rituals that originated hundreds of years ago, we shouldbe using our own symbols to stimulate our consciousness and help us reachout, beyond the limitations of our own minds.The mental laboratoryThink of the mental laboratory as a room, existing in your mind. It has atable, a couch, two chairs, all kinds of audiovisual equipment including atelephone, television, sophisticated speaker system, giant wall screen, etc.There’s also a large calendar, a large clock, a computer, a bookshelf, an eleva-tor, a door, a medicine cabinet, and shelves for various tools, musical instru-ments, and devices.The room can be located wherever you want, out in the countryside sur-rounded by nature, or on top of a tall building in the middle of a bustlingmetropolis. What is important is that you feel totally secure, relaxed, ready to"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 177concentrate, whenever you are in that room. All the techniques and exercisesyou perform while in the alpha state can be carried out in this room.The following examples suggest how you could use your mental labora-tory for practical purposes.Example 1: I wake up one day and discover that I’ve lost my wallet. Icheck my pockets, my briefcase, but I can’t find it. I concentrate, trying torecall where I last used it. I can’t be sure. I put myself in the alpha state,visualize myself entering my mental laboratory. I change the date on the cal-endar and the time on the clock to correspond to when I think I lost my wal-let, in this case the previous day. Then I sit down on the couch and relivewhat I was doing at that time. I had a number of meetings that day. Firstmeeting, I still had the wallet. Second meeting... yes, I still had it. Third meet-ing... when it was over I gathered up my papers, put my wallet on the table,intending to pick it up later and then... I got into a conversation with some-one and left the room with him... That’s it! That’s when I lost it.Instead of getting all upset and running around searching frantically forthe wallet, a few minutes of alpha concentration tells me exactly where tofind it. I emerge from the alpha state, call the company where I had the meet-ing and...Yes, they found the wallet, they were going to call me...Example 2 : I usually find it very difficult to summon up a mental imageof someone close to me. I don’t know why, but the image is always blurredand imprecise. The harder I try, the more the image tends to fade.When I started using my mental laboratory, I was surprised to see thefaces of persons I know appear on the room’s TV screen. The images wereextremely precise, I could see the color of their eyes, the texture of their skin.I had never been able to do that before.Creating some kind of imaginary support mechanism for our mental func-tions, and making use of the symbols common to our own century - symbolsrepresenting communication, knowledge, action, and so on - seem to short-circuit inhibited cerebral pathways and create new, more effective ones in"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 178their stead. And of course the mental laboratory can also be used for devel-oping paranormal faculties like telepathy, double vision, premonition, post-cognition, and so forth.I have never encountered two mental laboratories that were exactly thesame. Some people like to bury their special room underground. Others con-struct their lab on another planet. The materials people choose are also inter-esting: steel, wood, stone, glass, plastic, carpets, leather, luxurious or ascetic,antique or futuristic, etc. These choices always seem to correspond to thedeepest, most heartfelt aspirations of their creators, providing them with thepeace and harmony that is so often lacking in their day to day lives, wherethey find themselves besieged by colleagues, clients, secretaries, ringing tele-phones, TV, radio, traffic, children, etc. It is only while relaxing in their dreamlaboratory, gazing out at the scenery of their choice, that they feel completelysecure. This feeling leads to increased self confidence, which is extremelyimportant for preventing inhibiting reflexes from blocking out subconsciousimaging.Doctor Lozanov, who created a Center for Autosuggestion in Sophia,Bulgaria (supported by the Ministry of Education of that country) developeda unique way to teach languages. Upon entering the center, students had toset aside all their personal belongings, and imagine that they had become theperson they always wanted to be. They could change their name and imag-ine that they were someone else entirely for the duration of the course. Classeswere conducted with students in the alpha state. The results were absolutelyamazing - students were able to master university level English in only threeshort months!Unfortunately, we cannot check into an autosuggestion center wheneverwe want to liberate our mental faculties. On the other hand, creating yourown mental laboratory is just as effective, and permanently at your disposal.Your lab assistantsImagine two assistants, one man and one woman, sitting on the chairs inyour mental laboratory. The idea of using imaginary assistants to help de-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 179velop your intuitive faculties is not new. In 1937, Napoleon Hill, in his bookThink And Get Rich explains how he had the idea of gathering together agroup of illustrious personages in his imagination, in order to acquire someof their qualities for himself.What started off as a simple exercise in autosuggestion took a strangeturn. Each of his imagined personalities began to develop their own habits.Abraham Lincoln, for example, would always arrive late, and Hill sometimeshad trouble preventing the others from arguing with him about his lack ofpunctuality!“For the last few years, the experiment has taken a completely unexpectedturn. I now consult my group of imaginary councilors whenever I am facedwith a difficult problem. The results are often quite amazing.”John C. Lilly, the celebrated neurologist, who studied the human mindusing various techniques, including meditation, LSD, hypnosis, Gestalttherapy and sensory deprivation, had firsthand experience of death after acouple of near-fatal accidents.“Each time I was very close to death, each time I really thought I wasgoing to die, two persons - I can only describe them as mentors - appeared inmy mind. Now, whenever I have a difficult decision to make, these samementors come to me and advise me what to do.”When asked if his mentors were projections of his own imagination, Lilyreplied, “It is possible that my guides are aspects of my own subconscious orsuper-conscious mind... I really don’t know.”Carlos Castaneda, initiated into the mystical practices of the Hopi Indi-ans in New Mexico, often talks about his ‘allies’ as he calls them. For centu-ries the Catholic Church has encouraged believers to pray to guardian angelsand saints.The idea of imagining two assistants, a man and a woman, originatedwith José Silva, and corresponds to the concept of animus and anima pro-"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 180posed by Jung. In men, the anima, or feminine, intuitive, artistic part of theself, is repressed, for obvious cultural reasons (a man should not seem to beeffeminate, but always appear virile and strong).The opposite is true for women. The animus, the logical, rational, con-ceptual part of the mind, is repressed, because women should not appear tobe too masculine.“It is because we do not make conscious, intentional use of both aspects,considering them to be normal functions of our being, that the anima andanimus tend to create personality problems. As long as the repression contin-ues, the two aspects manifest themselves as relatively independent parts ofour personality. They cannot be fully integrated as long as we continue toignore one or the other.”Creating symbols for the animus and anima allow us to express parts ofourselves that would otherwise be repressed.Neuro-physiology has recently added a new stone to the edifice of ourunderstanding of the mind: it seems that our two cerebral hemispheres con-trol very distinct types of activity. The right brain corresponds to the animaand to spatial perception, while the left brain corresponds to the animus, andcontrols language functions.Robert E. Ornstein, who discovered the distinction between right and leftbrain functions, regrets the latent cultural conflict that exist between thesetwo modes of thinking - the linear, logical, verbal, left brain type of thinkingglorified by science and technology, as opposed to the intuitive, emotionalright brain way of thinking, related to the arts, spirituality, and creativity ingeneral. In fact, our culture has been built by persons using both logical andintuitive thought, and to say that one is better than the other is a mistake.On the contrary, people have to balance their right and left brain func-tions in order to become complete human beings, just as each twenty-fourhour cycle is a balance between day and night. The right brain’s powers ofimagination, intuition and dreaming should be taken into consideration, and"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Dreaming: A Parapsychological PhenomenonPage 181not be ignored as a futile waste of time and energy, as so many people tend todo. Ornstein goes so far as to say that developing right brain functions is anessential factor for our individual and cultural survival.I have often found myself in conversation with theosophists or spiritual-ists who say, “You talk about guides or assistants, but why are you hidingwho they really are? Why not admit that they are guardian angels, sent fromabove to help you?”I have no doubt that people who believe strongly enough in spirits willencounter them. I, on the other hand, prefer to maintain my own vision of theway things are. As John Lily said, “Everything we believe to be true is true, orat least becomes true in our mind. Of course there are certain limits that haveto be determined experimentally and individually. These limits, in turn, rep-resent new beliefs, which must eventually be transcended.”"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Lucid DreamingPage 182Lucid DreamingImages unfold before my eyes, as if I were watching an animated movie.The scenes are carefully drawn in very bright colors. I read the captions withamazement - the plot is clear, the dialog very lifelike.I am dreaming.I am dreaming, but I am lucidly aware that I am dreaming. I feel like aspectator watching my own creation. How is this possible? I draw very badly.It never occurred to me to make an animated film or write a cartoon. Howcan I be dreaming up this amazing spectacle?I look at the details of the images and analyze them: absolutely incred-ible. Since I am the creator, I suppose I can change an image if I want to. I canchange the way the story is going, can’t I? I try, but in vain. The best I can dois reframe an existing image, make it larger or smaller. So what is happening?Am I really creating all this?One night, visiting a friend and colleague, Philip Lecomte, at his countryhouse, I began talking about my experiences with lucid dreaming.“I started having spontaneous lucid dreams about a year ago. It was likehaving my very own dream laboratory. I was fascinated by the potential ap-plications. What if I could have a lucid dream whenever I wanted to? I triedrepeating positive formulations before falling asleep. “I can and will be con-scious while I dream. Whenever I have a lucid dream I will feel perfectlyrelaxed. I can modify my dreams whenever I want.”"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Lucid DreamingPage 183The more I practiced, the more I realized that making a conscious effortto overcome obstacles in my dreams was changing my behavior during mywaking hours, in a positive way, as if I were undergoing some form of therapy.I became so enthusiastic I started telling everyone about my new tech-nique, which I called LDT - Lucid Dream Therapy. I felt I had discoveredsomething important and unique.When I got home I noticed a book on my bookshelf entitled Dreams AndHow To Control Them by a fellow called Saint-Denis. It had been given to me ayear before, as a birthday present. I’d never opened it.The book was all about lucid dreaming, including its potential for thera-peutic application. What I thought I had discovered turned out to be more orless common knowledge way back in 1867, when the book was written!The book described lucid dreaming in much the same way as CarlosCastaneda, a modern day mystic, describes his method of dream control,which he learned from his Amerindian guide, Don Juan:“This technique consists of forcing images to stay in the mind long enoughto observe them carefully. To develop this ability you first have to chose anobject in advance, and practice looking for it in your dreams. Don Juan sug-gested I use my hands as a reference - whenever I became aware I was dream-ing I should look at my hands, and then at the scene before me. This wouldimmobilize the scene long enough for me to study it. After some months Ibecame adept at gazing at my hands while sleeping, and could thus immobi-lize images in my dreams. I was so fascinated I couldn’t wait to get to sleep atnight!”One of my alpha seminar students wrote me the following letter:“If I’m in good shape (not overtired or too preoccupied with some problem orother) I can program myself while I’m in the alpha state to be at least partially con-scious during my dreams. I often ask myself whether I should be writing the dreamdown or not while it’s still happening. Sometimes I interpret certain events or"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Lucid DreamingPage 184images, also while they’re still happening. At first, the subject of my dreamswas usually connected to events that happened in my waking life, one or twodays before. But after about a month of writing my dreams down and thenreading them over, I began developing a new, more sophisticated understand-ing of their symbolism. The process of remembering and writing my dreamsdown became easier and easier. I remember one night when I wrote downseven consecutive dreams (my record so far!).”Déjà-vuOne of the main reasons people are so interested in lucid dreaming, asidefrom its potential therapeutic application, is the opportunity it offers to verifysome of our theories concerning the waking and sleeping states. Because wehave trouble remembering them, and because they are often mysterious,dreams have been given a rather bizarre, fantastic significance.Lobsang Rampa, a mystic westerner who claims to be the reincarnationof a Tibetan lama, talked about the separation of body and mind that oc-curred in his dreams, the two entities being attached only by a thin silverstring. As we will see later, the phenomenon does exist, but to say that itoccurs regularly in the dream state is to refute the facts as reported by luciddreamers.Saint-Denis writes about having a similar kind of dream:“I am walking in Brussels, a city I had never been to. This is strange, Ithink. How can my imagination create a whole city in such detail? Suppose,as the Orientals believe, that the mind can travel on its own, while the body isasleep? That may be so, but it still doesn’t explain how this happens. I’venever been to Brussels in my life, and yet there is that famous cathedral I’veseen in paintings. This street I’m walking on, I have no recollection of everhaving been near it before. One thing is certain - if my memory can retainsuch detailed impressions without my even being aware of it, some phenom-enon is at work that merits further investigation. The important thing is tobase my theories on positive, verifiable facts, and to observe things very care-fully.”"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Lucid DreamingPage 185Saint-Denis’ dream was filled with remarkable detail: shopkeepers’ signs,street names, numbers, colors, and so on. One day he decided to take a trip toBrussels and verify for himself if what he had dreamed was real. The cathe-dral seemed very familiar, but it was not surrounded by narrow streets full ofshops, as it had been in his dream.“The truth is, I would have been more worried than pleased had my dreamturned out to be entirely accurate. The fact that there were inconsistenciesallowed me to refute the theory that dreams occur in some kind of fantasticparallel world.”But the story doesn’t end there. The narrow street lined with shops didexist, and all the details Saint-Denis dreamed were accurate. The only differ-ence was that the street was in another city - Frankfurt - which Saint-Denishad not visited for over ten years.“You can imagine my astonishment when I found myself strolling downa street that was similar in every detail to the one I had dreamed. I felt like Ihad stepped back in time, and that I had never really woken up.”This does not mean that the phenomena of clairvoyance experienced indreams, which would explain occurrences of déjà-vu, do not exist. Saint-Denis’subconscious mind was like a closed circuit, forming dream imagery basedon amazingly precise mental images drawn from his memory.Readers can see why the study of lucid dreaming is so important for un-derstanding phenomena like telepathy or premonition. While most scientistsstill claim that people do not dream outside of REM phases, Saint-Denis wrotein 1867:“No matter when I was awakened from sleep I always felt like a dreamhad been interrupted. Passing from the waking to the sleeping state happensgradually, without a complete suspension of the thought process.”Conditions for lucid dreaming"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Lucid DreamingPage 186Saint-Denis suggested three essential conditions for the act of lucid dream-ing:1.Developing the habit of writing dreams down immediately after wak-ing up, which will eventually result in your remaining conscious while dream-ing.2.Creating a signaling system for yourself: associating a certain memorywith a certain sensorial perception (looking at your hands, picking up a glass,drinking water, etc.) will trigger the act of lucid dreaming while you are asleep.3.These signal images should be incorporated in the scenes you dreamabout, allowing your conscious mind to take an active part in the dream pro-cess (this will inevitably occur as soon as you become aware that you aredreaming) so that you can guide and develop your dreams through an exer-cise of will, the principle being that as soon as you think of something, it willappear in your dream.”Lucid dreaming is an ongoing experience for me - I still have a lot to learnabout it. I have run into problems trying to master the technique, althoughthanks to mental dynamics I was able to experience my first lucid dreamafter only fifteen days of practice (it took Saint-Denis two hundred and sevendays). At one point I felt I had to stop because the exercise was disturbing mysleep. I overcame that obstacle a couple of months later by developing a sec-ond formulation (I will awaken from my lucid dream refreshed and com-pletely rested).I then had some trouble controlling my dreams, and had to be contentwith playing the role of lucid spectator. At present I am continuing my re-search into the phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Telepathic TrainingPage 187Telepathic TrainingThe year is 1960. Henry Marcotte, an ophthalmology therapist, is so busyhe has no time for leisure activities. He is fascinated by a technique calledvisual reeducation, notably something called the ‘flash’ method.A short-sighted subject, eyes closed, imagines an object that he wants tosee. He opens and closes his eyes very rapidly, until he obtains a clear flash ofthe object he has imagined. The flash is then extended to coincide with theopening and closing of his eyes - the longer they remain open, the longer theimage remains clearly formed in his field of vision.Another aspect of the method is to become conscious of the organic sen-sations that accompany the process of image creation, after subjects are ableto maintain their images more or less at will (this part of the technique closelyresembles the biofeedback and dynamic relaxation techniques described ear-lier).During the reeducation process, Marcotte frequently notes the character-istic distortion of images produced by each of his subjects.One day, while reading a book about telepathy, he was amazed to dis-cover that persons practicing telepathy experienced the same type of distor-tion, a little like a short-sighted person trying to recreate a drawing placed atthe limit of his field of vision.If the same kind of problem occurs during telepathic transmission, whynot try to apply the same method of visual reeducation to improve it?"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Telepathic TrainingPage 188In 1964 he approached an international funding organization with a pro-posal to conduct further experiments. The proposal was accepted, andMarcotte formed his team of researchers. After a period of some trial anderror experimentation, they made their first discovery: the ‘start / stop’method.Become telepathic in a few minutesIn one experiment, subjects tried to telepathically communicate the num-ber of lines drawn on a piece of paper. In order to do this, researchers estab-lished the following procedure : the person sending the message would drawlines on a sheet of paper; the person receiving the message would say ‘stop’when the right number of lines had been drawn.With this procedure in place, positive scores rose dramatically. Marcotteunderstood this to mean that movements, and the sensations they produce,are more easily perceived telepathically than images. He perfected the tech-nique, calling it ‘telesthesia’ - a new kind of sensory telepathy.The sender and receiver sit face to face, separated by a large screen sothat both are completely isolated.DIAGRAM: 1. Initial position (start)Observer 2. Stop position The sender performs a slow, regular movement, as if he were drawing astraight line, using his finger as a marker. As he begins the movement he says‘start’, thinking ahead of time of where he wants to stop, which he tries tocommunicate to the receiver. The receiver says ‘stop’ when he or she feels themovement has been completed. The exercise requires an observer, who knowsahead of time where the sender wants to stop. If the exercise is repeated witha number of senders, the receiver will soon find it easier to tune in to theresponse. Researchers also found that different senders emit varying degreesof mental energy, and that the strength of emitted messages increases withpractice."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Telepathic TrainingPage 189Receivers try to feel the movement, and the point where it is supposed tostop, and at the same time try to repeat it. The observer is there to verify theaccuracy of the receiver’s predictions, and provide help when necessary (in-dications like ‘that’s a little too fast...” are more frequently required at thestart of a session).If a screen is not available, the exercise can be carried out with the twochairs facing back to back. Or it could be done over the telephone, with thetwo participants thousands of miles apart (the role of the observer wouldbecome a little more complicated, as gestures would have to be seen overclosed circuit TV).After some practice, the two participants should attain 100% synchronicity.Both participants should be familiar with techniques that allow them to relaxand concentrate on their inner self. They must also be fully focussed on theirown sensations, and those of the other person involved. In addition, thereshould be no hesitation or change in the movement once it is initiated, sincethe very first intention of the sender is what will be perceived by the receiver.The fact that gestures are easier to transmit and receive telepathicallythan words or images was discovered by Marcotte and his team of research-ers. This is in keeping with the basic hierarchy of communication systems -the more primitive they are, the easier they are to perceive.Have you ever tried staring at the back of someone’s head?It often happens that the person will feel that they are being watched,and turn around. Soviet researchers conducted experiments which provedthat this type of innate survival reaction does indeed exist in humans. OneSoviet researcher, Kuni, tried combining images and tactile sensations in hisexperiments on telepathy. In one experiment he attempted to transmit theimage and the sensation of a hot cup of tea to 17 persons in a state of hypno-sis. All the subjects experienced a sensation of heat, to a greater or lesser de-gree. In another experiment he pricked himself with a needle. Once again all17 subjects reacted, most of them by crying out in pain."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Telepathic TrainingPage 190We can see how the classic test of telepathy - asking subjects to guesswhich card has been pulled from a deck - is one of the worst ways to obtain atelepathic connection, since playing cards are composed of images and a ver-bal symbol (the King of hearts, for example).Marcotte’s other discovery was based on a combination of the ‘start /stop ‘and ‘flash’ techniques.Both sender and receiver would close their eyes; the sender would openhis eyes suddenly, then close them again, at which point the receiver would‘see’ a very faint light, accompanied by a sensation in the eyes.Next came the idea of adding a drawing or photograph to the flash tech-nique. This method yielded excellent results, if the following conditions weremet:1.Both participants had succeeded in the eye synchronization exercise (ifthey hadn’t this experiment would fail).2.The sender had to concentrate not on the drawing or photograph itself,but on its after-image (for example, if you stare at a light bulb for a few sec-onds and then close your eyes, what you see is the after-image, a kind ofnegative impression of the light bulb that stays on your retina for some sec-onds).3.Pinpoint timing is essential. In these kinds of experiments, telepathy,premonition and post-cognition can sometimes become confused. Some sys-tem of exact timing (usually controlled by a third party) should be put inplace.Over the years Marcotte and his team have worked on refining the tech-niques they discovered. When asked what practical use his work might have,Marcotte responded that enhancing people’s telepathic powers helps themcommunicate better, and gain a better comprehension of themselves and theworld around them. On the other hand, he is hostile to the idea of addingemotions to the list of sensations that can be communicated telepathically.He insists that the process should be cold, mechanical, and as objective aspossible. Is this the best way to get results? Many people would not agree, aswe will see in the next chapter."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Telepathy and EmotionPage 191Telepathy and EmotionAsk a question and they both say almost the same thing at the same time.She thinks of something, he starts talking about it. She starts a sentence, hefinishes it. She is in pain, he suffers along with her. They often find them-selves thinking about the same thing, and each knows exactly how the otherfeels.Of course, we’re talking about two people in love.When you share feelings with someone you love, you develop a degreeof ‘emotional communication’ with that person. Mothers get up in the middleof the night, feeling their infant’s need for comfort or nourishment. A hus-band wakes up in a cold sweat just as his beloved wife dies in a car crashthousands of miles away.This type of telepathy occurs frequently. The works of Warcollier, Rhineand Vassiliev provide ample documentation of incidences of telepathy be-tween person involved in a loving relationship. Parapsychologists proposedthe existence of what they called an emotional field as a possible explanationof the phenomenon.Any skilled researcher of telepathic transmission is aware of how impor-tant emotional fields are. In order to create the best possible conditions forsuccess, various methods have been devised to bring the emotional aspectinto play (passionate interest, rivalry, mutual love, music, mood, etc.).The smallest emotional field concerns that of the ego itself. The largest isthe feeling generated by a sense of communion with the universe. The kindsof emotions generated - sympathy, love, altruism, compassion - correspond"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Telepathy and EmotionPage 192to the different types of telepathic relationships. William James consideredparanormal phenomena proof of the existence of spirituality.If you want to develop your paranormal faculties, you have to enlargethe scope of your emotional field. You have to try and live in harmony, notonly with your immediate family and circle of friends, but with all people. Inother words, you have to feel at one with the universe. We are all parts of awhole, in the same way that the billions of brain cells in your head constitutea single brain. Every individual represents a single element in a vast commu-nication system called the collective unconscious (experiments on animalsand plants have shown that they too feel, which means the vast communica-tion system that links all humans should perhaps be extended to include alllife). Imagine billions of human brains, linked through their subconscious,forming what some have called ‘infinite intelligence.’But being in harmony with others is only possible when you have achievedinner harmony. All the great spiritual masters - Lao Tzu, Buddha, Jesus andMohammed - had the same message: they all said “Love thy neighbor ASthyself...” not “Love they neighbor MORE THAN thyself.”To do that you first have to accept yourself the way you are, and come toappreciate and love yourself.We stand at the frontier of a new era. In former times, mysticism, para-psychology, and human relations seemed to be in conflict with each other.Now, scientifically documented paranormal phenomena help prove thatpeople really are psychically linked, rather than isolated individuals wan-dering around in a strange hostile world. There will come a time when whathas been considered mystical or mysterious will, like paranormal phenom-ena, seem commonplace. There is nothing to prevent us from crossing overto the other side. In the same way that the mysticism of the past has becomethe paranormal of today, what is considered paranormal today will becomethe psychology of tomorrow."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"AuraPage 193Aura“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became aliving soul.”Genesis 2, Verse 7Man has been wondering about the mystery of life since the dawn oftime. Once all the chemical components are in place, how do you ‘breathe thebreath of life’ into your creation? How do you transform matter into a livingsoul?In Latin the word aura referred to breath. To mystics, aura represents akind of halo of light, enveloping the body, visible only to those who havebeen taught how to see it. Others explain that aura is an emanation of theenergy field that gives us life, and call it the subtle or astral body.During solar eclipses we can see rays of energy, like huge sheaths of flame,emanating from the surface of the sun, while its center is masked by the moon.In the same way, our subtle, etheric body is masked by our physical body - allwe can see of it are the rays of its aura.There is an amazing resemblance in the various descriptions of the hu-man aura. Yogis, theosophists, clairvoyants and mystics all describe more orless the same phenomenon. On the other hand, their observations are by nomeans scientific, so we cannot conclude that the human aura does, indeed,exist, simply because so many people claim it does."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"AuraPage 194The Kirlian EffectA Russian researcher, S.D. Kirlian, aided by his wife Valentina, finallymanaged to convince the extremely conservative scientific community of theexistence of what he called an ‘energy body’ composed of bioplasm.Scientists around the world were amazed by Kirlian’s discovery, and especially by its proposed practical application - the earlydetection of both physical and mental diseases through an analysis of thecolors of a patient’s aura, which Kirlian referred to as ‘bioluminescence.’Hospitals soon began equipping themselves with devices designed to mea-sure the Kirlian effect. Here’s how one observer described an image producedby a Kirlian device:“... fireworks exploding against a dark blue background, sheaths of mul-ticolored sparks in the midst of flames and dazzling flashes. Some light pat-terns had the regular glow of candles, while others were explosions of blind-ing light, which gradually faded. Some flew by like flaming meteors. In someareas we could see dark filaments of vapor floating in space. Random flashesoutlined a sparkling, labyrinth-like structure resembling a spacecraft in searchof new galaxies.”This was no dream imagery, or the product of some poet’s unbridledimagination, but the report of a Russian academic after witnessing the bio-plasmic aura produced by a human hand, as seen through a Kirlian photo-graphic device.The year is 1939. A technician in the city of Krasnodar is called in to re-pair a high frequency machine used for electrotherapy. He notices a brilliantglare between the patient’s skin and an electrode linked to the machine. Hetries to photograph the phenomenon, which turns out to be a variation ofsomething called the corona effect, an occurrence that is well known in thefield of electronics."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"AuraPage 195First discovery: the corona photographed in this way varies in accordancewith the level of vital energy of the body emitting it. Kirlian could actuallysee the energy stored in plants and animals. He soon realized that diseasedplants and animals emitted less light, while dead plants and animals emittedno light at all. Intense bioluminescent activity surrounds every living entity,while dead entities produce no bioluminescence whatsoever.Second discovery: the existence of a kind of energy body, composed ofbioplasm, which is closely linked to the physical body. If you take a leaf andcut away a small part, the energy image emitted by the leaf remains intact,although the part that was amputated become less bright. This phantom im-age of the missing part of the leaf confirms the theory of an energy body, andmay explain why many amputees continue to experience perceptions frommissing limbs, as if they had a phantom limb (no other satisfactory explana-tion for this phenomenon has been offered to date).Third discovery: Examining two leaves picked from the same species oftree at the same time, Kirlian noticed a difference between them. One leafemitted small points of flame, a shape he had never seen before.He learned that although both leaves came from the same type of tree,one of the trees had been inoculated against a serious form of disease.His conclusion: Long before the disease manifested itself in the body ofthe tree, it showed up as a clear pattern in the tree’s energy field.Further research showed that the phenomenon was applicable to humansas well as plants, paving the way for the medical application of the Kirliantechnique as a diagnostic tool.After examining a series of Kirlian photographs, a surgeon in Leningrad,M.K. Gaikine, wondered if it would be possible to relate the photographicimages to the 700 or so acupuncture points used by practitioners of Chinesemedicine and its variations. His suggestion turned out to be very useful, es-pecially for practitioners of acupuncture, who were finally able to offer scien-tific proof of the effectiveness of their technique. As it turned out, the energy"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"AuraPage 196centers designated in acupuncture diagrams correspond more or less exactlyto the dense areas of light, called ‘sunspots,’ visible in Kirlian photographs.Using Kirlian’s procedure, Dr. Gaikine and a Leningrad engineer wereable to develop a device that could detect the location of acupuncture pointsto within a tenth of a millimeter (the device was included as one of the offi-cial Russian exhibits at the 1967 World’s Fair held in Montreal, Canada).Research in the United StatesWhile serving in the Korean war, Kendall L. Johnson was disturbed by aseries of premonitory dreams he had about the death of a number of soldiersin his platoon. When he returned home after the war, he decided to take acourse in parapsychology at UCLA.One day his teacher, Doctor Thelma Moss, spoke to the class about theKirlian device. She said she had acquired a set of plans while on a trip toRussia, but so far no one had been able to reproduce the Kirlian effect. Johnson,although he was an insurance salesman by profession, decided he wouldgive it a try.His initial attempts proved to be positive enough for the university toallot him space to set up a laboratory, and for the CIA and NASA to sendrepresentatives to examine possible applications of the technique.Moss and Johnson copied Kirlian’s device (even though it was protectedby fourteen international patents) and oriented their research towards theparanormal.One of their experiments concerned persons who claimed to be able toreproduce the effects of magnetism, discussed earlier in this book. They dis-covered that before the imposition of hands and magnetic passes, the aura ofso-called magnetic healers was very strong (much stronger than that of anordinary person), but that after a session the aura would weaken, while thatof the patient would grow larger and clearer. They wondered if that could"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"AuraPage 197explain the prickling sensation, accompanied by heat, that patients generallyreported feeling during a session of magnetic therapy.They also tried to reproduce Kirlian’s phantom leaf experiment, but failed.Perhaps their equipment was not as sensitive as Kirlian’s own device. Profes-sor E. Douglas Dean, using a Kirlian device manufactured in Czechoslova-kia, was able to reproduce Kirlian’s findings exactly, while Richard M.Szumski, director of the photo lab at San Jose State University, tried hun-dreds of times to achieve the same result, with no success, and eventuallygave up. Two other researchers, William Tiller and David Boyers, consideredtheir results too inconclusive to lead to any practical applications.Reading thoughts through colorsPeople’s auras seems to be just as closely related to their psychologicalstate of mind as to their physical condition. An unbalanced, nervous personwill have a narrow, jagged aura, while a person who is well balanced andrelaxed will emit a bright, broad aura.An aura’s color is an indication of a person’s emotional state. Blue signi-fies a state of calm, concentrated relaxation. Red is an indication of violentemotions. Red and blue are the two basic color that comprise all auras. Dis-tractions, worries or fears that arise after a period of calm will appear as redsplotches mixed with the predominant blue. Anger will produce a large redaura (the expression ‘to see red’ is appropriate in this context). Red is alsoindicative of some imbalance in the organism, or of a physical wound. It isinteresting to note that clairvoyants often perceive psychological problemsas a reddish glow.Auras are also linked to parapsychological phenomena. It seems that tele-pathic messages are initially perceived by the subtle or energy body. Experi-ments conducted in the former Soviet Union show that auras react beforeconsciousness. By modifying a person’s energy body using acupuncture, para-normal faculties can be stimulated.Interacting auras"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"AuraPage 198When you caress someone’s face or hold someone’s hand, two auras in-teract, and an exchange of energy takes place. Therapists often describe howthey are able to alleviate pain through massage, and how, after a session isover, they actually feel some of the patient’s pain themselves.Two researchers, Johnson and Mors, called this phenomenon the ‘trans-fer effect.’ Johnson claimed that what he found most interesting about hiswork with auras was that it showed that our beings extend beyond the limitsof our skin, that we all possess another body made of pure energy, which is inconstant interaction with our environment, and the people we come in con-tact with.Will the Kirlian device prove to be an important scientific discovery? In-dications are that it will. Although its potential applications have not beenfully explored even today, forty years after its discovery, there has been re-newed interest in the technique of late. On the other hand, perhaps the great-est impact of Kirlian’s invention will turn out to be symbolic - for the firsttime in the history of humanity, science and mysticism seem to be in accord.Concerning the subtle or energy body, all mystics, from Zoroaster toHeraclitus, from the Hebrew cabalists to Saint Paul, are in agreement. Theidea is the same in all their writings: “The vibrant substance that the Creatorreferred to as the ‘breath of life’ takes on a subtle form in the nervous systemof all living beings. It is transmitted through all our limbs, and its sensationsare perceived by the brain. This subtle substance forms a living organismwhich is just as real as our material body.” (Quoted from The Great Initiates byE. Shuré, written in 1889).Although we have not yet seen a complete fusion of scientific and reli-gious thought, we can certainly expect to achieve a better understanding be-tween the two modes of thought as we approach the millennium.Auras and ghostsExcept for a few kids movies like Casper The Friendly Ghost andGhostbusters, ghosts are not very fashionable these days. But at the turn of"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"AuraPage 199the century things were quite different. Famous mediums were renownedfor the bizarre ectoplasmic apparitions they were able to produce during theirseances. Witnesses included some of the greatest thinkers of the time, includ-ing Pierre and Marie Curie, and the philosopher Bergson.I once had the pleasure of visiting Robert Tocquet, whom I have alreadytalked about in an earlier chapter. Tocquet was very familiar with these kindsof experiments. Being a rationalist, he refused to fall into the trap of enthusi-astic credulity. At the same time, he was convinced of the reality of a numberof apparitions produced by people like Kluski or Rudi Schneider, both wellknown mediums.I asked him how he explained these kinds of highly unusual phenomena.Here’s what he had to say:“To my mind, the apparitions are emanations of the medium himself.They are representations of his subconscious. When a medium produces afamiliar face, he does so be delving into the subconscious mind of someonewho is present at the seance. I take as proof of the material reality of theseapparitions the fact that mediums clearly experience a loss of weight duringtheir representations. Perhaps the phenomenon is caused by an unknownaspect of their aura emanations. Perhaps physical manifestations of theirpower, like the twisting of cutlery or the displacement of objects from a dis-tance, can also be caused by this same energy field, once it is focussed andcontrolled.”Since science has still not been able to offer a satisfactory explanation forthese phenomena, we can assume, at least for the time being, that ProfessorTocquet may very well be right. Only time will tell."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 200Out-of-Body ExperiencesAs we have seen, most mediums separate themselves from their ownpersonality when using their paranormal faculties. Why? Because in theirordinary state of consciousness they are often fearful of their own powers,and astonished by the things they are able to ‘see.’ When they enter the trancestate, they tend to assume someone else’s personality, often the ‘spirit’ of adeceased doctor. This endows them with new faculties, like the ability to per-form an on-the-spot operation without anesthesia, using the crudest of in-struments (see the case of José Arigo), or diagnose a health problem and pre-scribe an effective cure (as Edgar Cayce did on hundreds of occasions).If they are asked, while still in the trance state, how they are able to diag-nose a health problem, they reply that they can see the patient’s subtle bodyor aura, and interpret its constantly changing colors and movements to de-termine whether various organs are healthy or diseased. Doctor Lang sug-gests that mediums are able to operate on a patient’s subtle body, and thatthe healing that takes place in the subtle body is then gradually transferred tothe patient’s corresponding organs. To perform such an operation, the subtlebody must first be separated from the physical body.There are thousands of people who claim to have experienced a separa-tion from their physical body at some time or other. The phenomenon oftenoccurs while patients are being anesthetized prior to surgery. Here is a typi-cal example of this type of experience:Mrs. J: “I suddenly had the feeling that I was being freed from my body,but that I was still completely myself. I studied my body, stretched out belowme on the bed. My two sisters and my mother-in-law were there in the room.One of my sisters was sitting on the bed, warming my hands, while my other"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 201sister sat on the other side of the bed, not moving, just staring at me. Al-though I didn’t feel the slightest desire to re-enter my body, I felt compelledto do so against my will...“But the most amazing part of the whole thing was this: as soon as Iwoke up I said, ‘Where’s Mrs. K?’ (the patient’s mother-in-law). Now, Mrs. Kwas not there when they gave me the anesthesia. She arrived after they hadput me under. When she asked me how I knew she was there I said I saw hercome in.”The word anesthesia is derived from the Greek ‘an’ meaning cessationand ‘aisthesis’ meaning senses. The phenomenon of body separation (or as-tral travelling as some call it) only occurs when ordinary consciousness - andits corresponding sense perceptions - have been altered. It is as if the exterior-ization of awareness can only take place when ordinary sensations are nolonger being transmitted along their usual pathways.Let’s go back to the simplest form of extrasensory perception, referred toas double vision. Strangely enough, clairvoyants who use this technique canonly ‘see’ with their eyes closed. One of the greatest mediums of this century,Vanga Dimitrova, received a grant from the Bulgarian government that en-abled her to carry on with her work, even though she was blind. Persons wholose their physical sight often develop an extra-retinal sense of color (i.e. theyperceive colors, but not with their eyes).Numerous parapsychological experiments were conducted on deaf mutesin the USSR, because they were found to be the best subjects - they weremuch more tuned in to paranormal perceptions than people with all five sensesfunctioning properly.Through paranormal sense projection, subjects under hypnosis can actu-ally feel whatever the hypnotist feels. Extrasensory perception usually onlyworks when ordinary sense perceptions have been interrupted, or severelylimited."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 202Hypnosis, certain drugs and certain states of consciousness can causeordinary sense perceptions to be projected over distances. In one experimenta subject had no trouble hearing an intimate conversation that was takingplace three hundred yards away. The complete exteriorization of the sensesis only one among many possibilities.“Subjects feel as if they are outside their body, able to move around inspace, but limited to the confines of their ordinary sense perceptions (whichcan sometimes be quite extensive).“The phenomenon could be considered to be a paranormal illusion, sincethe source of the perception is too far away to be perceived normally, necessi-tating the displacement of the subject’s subtle body through paranormalmeans. In fact there is no separate entity outside the body, but merely anenlargement, or intensifying of sensory perception.”A number of laboratory experiments were conducted by the AmericanSociety for Psychic Research. One subject, Ingo Swann, a writer and artist,was able to leave his body at will. He would describe objects and drawingsplaced in a completely isolated, locked room with regular success. He couldalso locate objects randomly placed in another room with a fair amount ofaccuracy. The difficulty lay in determining what type of paranormal phe-nomenon was involved. Was it clairvoyance? Telepathy? Double vision? Therewas no way of telling.Throughout the experiments Swann continued talking and respondingto people, describing in detail the various sensations he experienced. Most ofthe time he described visual perceptions. Tactile, olfactory and gustatory sen-sations were almost never mentioned.How to develop your faculties of sensoryexteriorization and astral travellingThere are three theories that attempt to explain the phenomenon of astraltravelling:"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 2031. Exteriorization of sensory perceptions creating an illusion of astral travelling.2. Illusory astral travelling - consciousness is somehow projected to a locationwhere the senses perceive it to be.3. The subtle body actually separates from the physical body, which remains whereit is, in a state of complete unconsciousness.My own personal experience tends to confirm the first theory. Duringsessions when I practiced mental projection, I have seen objects or peoplewhom I wanted to touch or grasp, disappear. These objects or persons wereobviously mental constructions, created by my own mind, based on paranor-mal sensory information.Whatever the explanation (it could be a combination of all three theo-ries), the ability to project your consciousness outside of your body is a fac-ulty that can be developed.What conditions are required to produce the phenomenon?1. Entering the alpha state. Reports are conclusive: a state between waking andsleep is highly conducive to astral travelling. Here’s what one astral travelerhas to say:Mrs. S.: “Usually when I leave my body I’m in a state of semi-conscious-ness, somewhere between being awake and being asleep. Sometimes I getthe feeling I’m living in two worlds at the same time. I can see my bodystretched out on the bed, and hear voices both in the real world, and in theworld my subtle body is inhabiting.”2. Gradual exteriorization of the senses. Yoga provides an excellent methodfor doing this. You start by concentrating on your feet and calves, focussing onthe sensations in these parts of your body. Then you direct your awarenessupward, imagining that your energy body is able to separate itself from yourphysical body and float above it. As you do this you no longer feel any sensa-tions in your feet or calves. Repeat the process, focussing on other parts of yourbody, until you reach your neck, at which point you will feel your energy body"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 204flooding into your head, like a torrent racing through the narrow opening ofyour throat. You will then feel your consciousness escaping out the top of yourhead. When it is completely free, it can be sent anywhere you desire.Communicating and explaining this kind of purely subjective process isdifficult - you have to experience a mental voyage firsthand in order to reallyunderstand what it’s like.The yoga technique seems to be similar to the natural mechanism whichtriggers the phenomenon of astral travelling, since descriptions of spontane-ous occurrences begin in more or less the same way.“First my feet, then my legs became numb, as if the life had gone out ofthem. I felt like I was being pulled upward, head first.”3. Positive formulations. Some preparation using positive formulations can bevery helpful. Astral travelling is more difficult to achieve than clairvoyance,where only one of the senses is exteriorized (while astral travelling, all thesenses are exteriorized).Jose Silva suggests the following formulation:“I am learning to develop my five senses and project my mind anywherein the universe.”Personally, I prefer this formulation:“I am developing my faculties of concentration and mental projection. Iam learning to project my awareness and all my senses wherever I want. Ican project my senses anywhere in the entire universe.”It’s actually a mistake to talk about only five senses. In fact, we have morethan twenty senses, including a sense of direction, balance, weight, and soon."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 205You have to exteriorize all your senses in order to be fully aware whileastral travelling.Trial experimentDuring the alpha seminar, we conduct a trial experiment on completesensory exteriorization. Many participants are unable to achieve full separa-tion of their subtle and physical bodies, while others seem to be natural astraltravelers. A number of conclusions have been drawn from these experiments.1.The reality of the experience. Details observed while astral travelling gen-erally turn out to be accurate. Contrary to what Saint-Denis reported, datacollected while persons are separated from their body is not produced bysome kind of short circuit in the mind while it is cut off from exterior reality.Take the case of M.T., who paid an astral visit to his wife’s parents’ house,where his young daughter was being looked after. He saw his daughter tripand fall to the ground, and start crying. When he returned to his normal stateof consciousness he insisted that his wife call her parents to find out if theirdaughter was all right. To her astonishment, his wife was told that her daugh-ter had hurt herself (this occurred while her husband was astral travelling)but that she was not seriously injured.Of course it does often happen that people’s imaginations remain activeeven while they are outside their body, adding information that might not bebased on fact.2.Sensations are expressed physically. This occurs quite frequently, as in thecase of Edgar Cayce. Some subjects start smiling or laughing to express theirjoy, others exhibit muscular contractions to indicate movement and other sen-sations.It is as if brain centers are being directly stimulated by sensations per-ceived while having an out-of-body experience, and are then transferred bythe brain to various parts of the body."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 206During the course of all our experiments, it has never happened that anastral traveler has been ‘seen’ while separated from his or her physical body.There have been reports of people ‘feeling’ a presence, and subjects have some-times received phone calls the next day, from people asking if they had triedto get in touch with them. Questions like “Were you thinking about me yes-terday?” or “Did you dream about me last night?” are common. On the otherhand, there have been reports of a subject’s physical body being seen in twolocations at the same time, a phenomenon referred to as ‘bilocation’.One of the most famous cases of bilocation concerns a certain Major Tu-dor Pole, an industrialist, archeologist and writer. Major Pole spent part ofWorld War 2 living on a houseboat on the Nile River. One day he suddenlycame down with a high fever. He was so weak he couldn’t even tell his ser-vants to stop at the next village so he could see a doctor. He was lying in hisroom when he heard a knock at the door. He thought is was one of his ser-vants, but when the door opened he saw a man, carrying a doctor’s bag,dressed in an overcoat, which was very unusual attire for a hot country likeEgypt.The man walked in, greeted Major Pole in a friendly manner and sat downon the edge of his bed. The Major thought the man had been sent by col-leagues in the underground resistance movement to help him. The doctorsaid he didn’t have the necessary medication with him, and told Major Poleto send one of his servants to a pharmacy in the next town to get a specialherbal remedy. He wrote out a prescription and handed it over.At that moment the major realized that he could see right through thedoctor’s hat, which he had removed and placed on the bedstead. With char-acteristic British indignation, the major demanded that the visitor explainwho he was, and who had sent him.The man said he was a doctor, and that he had gotten into the habit ofclosing his office early in the evening so that he could pray for guidance andask to be sent wherever he was most needed. After giving the major assur-ances that he would soon get better, he wished him a good day and took hisleave."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Out-of-Body ExperiencesPage 207The major did, indeed, recover. When he got back to England he triedevery possible means to get in touch with the doctor who had helped him.He even persuaded the BBC to broadcast his story internationally, askingthat the doctor in question make himself known. A short time later a Scottishphysician got in touch with Major Pole, who recognized him at once. Thedoctor said that he had had a number of similar experiences. His only worrywas that the Medical College might get wind of what he was doing and startasking questions.It seems rather strange that in Major Pole’s account, the astral travellingdoctor was wearing a full suit of clothes. For that reason, I would suggestthat another type of paranormal phenomenon was at work, perhaps a formof telepathy that was so strong it created a perfect sensory hallucination, whichled the major to believe he had actually seen someone in his room."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Edgar CaycePage 208Edgar CayceNow that we have more or less come full circle in our exploration of para-normal phenomena, I’d like to return to the aspect that got me interested inthe first place: the faculty of diagnosing health problems over distances. Oneyear after deciding to conduct our alpha seminars, a year spent in testing andperfecting various techniques, we announced our first seminar. It went verywell. Most of the participants were friends or relations. All had been fasci-nated by what we had to say about the alpha experience.The only exception was my mother. Confident and enthusiastic at first,she began to have more and more doubts as the weekend continued. By thetime we got around to Edgar Cayce’s diagnosis technique, she was totallyunable to relax.She seemed very nervous, as if she were worried about something. I triedmy best to reassure her, and asked to see the ‘case history’ that she had beengiven to diagnose. At the top of the page I read, ‘Internal cataract of the righteye.’ Further down I noted that the patient was a ten year old girl.“Relax... try and relax...” I said. The soothing tone of my voice seemedto help. My mother closed her eyes and began breathing deeply.“What do you see?”“I can’t see anything. Everything’s blurred.”Then, suddenly, she started talking. It was like a dam had burst insideher. She talked for a full forty minutes, about a young girl she had never met.She seemed very emotional, as if she were experiencing the girl’s joy and"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Edgar CaycePage 209suffering herself. Towards the end of her discourse she described in detailwhat the girl would have to do to regain her health.It’s pretty strange to see someone you know so well - in this case my ownmother - transformed into a medium. I could actually feel the intensity of heremotions, as well as the seriousness of the girl’s situation. It was quite a shock,I must admit. Here is a transcript of some of what my mother said while inher trance:“She’s a slim brown-haired girl, her hair is cut short, just above her neck.It’s her right eye. It’s bad. I can’t do anything for her. She has to develop herother senses, she has to want to live again. She needs to be out in the fresh air,out in nature. She needs to play. Her other eye isn’t so bad, she should forceherself to use it more. She has a small mouth, and fine thin lips. She loves tolearn things, she wants to study. Somebody should teach her music. She needsa lot of affection. She feels so alone now, so abandoned. She needs animals, adog would be wonderful, she could walk and run with it, she could love itand be loved in return. She should be doing things with her hands, she needsto feel useful. She should be doing something for other people. Her parentsdon’t give her enough attention. They should treat her like a normal child,instead of making her feel handicapped...”I couldn’t stop her. She went on and on, describing the girl’s home life,the house she lived in, her character, her parents. A small group of peoplehad formed around the prostrate figure of my mother, as she kept talking amile a minute. All that information, I thought, some of it has to be wrong. Wefound the person who had written up the case history. When he saw mynotes he was absolutely astonished - everything my mother said was com-pletely accurate.“It’s perfect,” he exclaimed, “perfect in every detail.”Another case comes to mind from among the hundreds I have witnessedsince then. This one concerned a businessman, Mr. R., who had been per-suaded to attend the seminar by his wife. He was extremely skeptical about"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Edgar CaycePage 210everything that went on, which made his conversion all the more meaning-ful.Mr. R. submitted his father’s case history to be diagnosed by anotherparticipant. Here’s a part of what was the subject said while in the alphastate:“This man doesn’t actually live in L. No, he lives in a suburb of the city.He lost his wife some years ago, and has never gotten over her death. Hesuffers from melancholy, especially since his son never comes to see him. Hetakes homeopathic pills. He’s corpulent, suffers from severe headaches. Heneeds his son’s affection.”Mr. R was close to tears - everything was true. He had been neglecting hisfather, hadn’t been to see him in months. It was touching to see a man, hard-ened by years in the world of business, become so emotional. I remember another young female subject who had this to say about herpatient: “There’s absolutely nothing wrong with her. She just complains sopeople will pay attention to her. She moans and groans, never sits still...”You have to be very sure of yourself to say something like that, especiallyin a situation where everyone is expecting you to be sympathetic to thepatient’s health problem. Nevertheless, the diagnosis was entirely accurate,down to the last detail.A diagnosis can also be influenced by the character of the person makingit. In this case, the subject seemed to be describing herself rather than thepatient:“I see a man, short, fat, round face, wearing a dark suit. He shows noexterior signs of being sick. Maybe the disease is still developing, or maybe ithas just been cured. I suggest losing some weight. He should go on a diet,even though he isn’t too thrilled about the idea. He should be informed thatobesity is dangerous. He needs to be pushed, scared into doing something.He doesn’t seem to care about his health, but at the same time he’s good"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Edgar CaycePage 211natured, enjoys life. It’s just that he’s a bit of a glutton! He should find otherways to compensate. Sex maybe?”Then there are the tragic-comic cases: “Old bachelor, gripes at all thenurses, irascible. He even tried to hit someone with his cane. Almost deaf,doesn’t like company because he says people keep repeating themselves...”And the purely tragic: “She needs some kind of placebo medication soshe can keep believing her health problem is serious. Her real problem issolitude. She’s afraid of dying alone.”“She keeps on living because she has to, not because she wants to.”“This person doesn’t seem to have a life. And yet she’s not that old. Shemight as well be dead.” (The woman did die a few months later).Here’s an unusual one: “This person seems to be playing a role in somekind of dangerous game, like James Bond...” The case history did, in fact,concern a man who worked as a spy.In some cases a subject may simply refuse to make a diagnosis: “I don’twant to explore this man’s body, I detest this individual, he is evil.”Or: “I want to get out of here, quickly. I feel uneasy, anguished...”Seeing a person who was smiling and relaxed one minute start writhingaround, overcome with emotion, experiencing physical sensations that aresometimes extremely painful, is very strange indeed.Of course not everyone can attain this degree of intensity on their first try- only 30% to 40% of subjects succeed in doing so. 20% to 30% fail altogether,while the remaining 20% to 30% have some degree of success, with informa-tion being drawn both from their active and passive imagination. Almosteveryone succeeds on their second or third try, which is why participants areencouraged to attend alpha seminars as often as they want."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Edgar CaycePage 212Diagnosed diseases include most of the common diseases of our time,the most prevalent being cancer, ulcers, circulation problems and bone dis-eases like arthritis and rheumatism. The causes are often psychological. It isboth surprising and saddening to see the number of sick persons sufferingfrom solitude and a complete lack of tenderness and affection."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Healing Over DistancesPage 213Healing Over DistancesWhen you communicate with people who are suffering, when you actu-ally inhabit someone’s body and live the experience, feel what they are feel-ing, there’s nothing more normal than wanting to help.We have seen how the power of suggestion impacts our organism. Pio-neers like Janet and Richer demonstrated that suggestion can be effectiveover distances. Why, then, would it not be possible to help a sick person,even though that person was far away, by concentrating on a mental imageof healing?Although practiced for centuries, the concept of healing over distancestends to arouse a certain amount of skepticism. Perhaps people are averse tothe idea of healing someone without their knowing it. Many of the ceremo-nies surrounding the practice (dipping a photograph of the patient in mag-netized water, lighting candles, etc.) are associated with magic, and viewedas some kind of obscure form of mysticism.But once again, we should be careful not to jump to conclusions. Why notsimplify the technique instead of discarding it. Get rid of all the trappings,and develop a method of healing over distances that has nothing to do withthe occult or the divine. A parapsychological method of healing, possiblybased on the aura phenomenon, which seems to be connected both to tele-pathic communication and physiological well being.Since the work is carried out on a subconscious level, the use of symbolsis appropriate. In his mental laboratory, Jose Silva included a variety of medi-cal instruments and remedies that could be used for healing the sick."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Healing Over DistancesPage 214In the same way that a hypnotist, using the technique of suggestion overdistances, ‘sees’ his subject in a trance, our ‘healer’ would be able to see thetreatment at work, and in time, help a patient fully recover.Experiments tend to show that a healer’s intention or desire to help finda solution is more important than the procedure itself. On the other hand,attempts to heal which are carried out without any procedure, i.e. withoutany mental preparation, are almost certain to fail. As Oscar Wilde said, ‘Goodintentions alone are like checks that bounce!’All of us get a glimpse of our own healing powers at some point. Youmay know someone who is going through a difficult period and say some-thing like, “I’ll be thinking about you.”Well, thinking about someone is fine, but concentrating on the personwhile in an altered state of consciousness can be of real help.Extraordinary results, all documented in a laboratory setting, have beenobtained treating problems like recurring headaches, accelerating the heal-ing of wounds, alleviating certain types of pain, and so on.It often happens that participants who use the technique to help a familymember during an alpha seminar, return home to find their loved one hasunexpectedly recovered, or is experiencing much less discomfort.“My sister Irene and I were really able to improve the health of our mother,who was suffering from —. From that day on she stopped having pains.”In my opinion, the only limits of the procedure are related to the healer’sown telepathic prowess, or lack of thereof, which may explain why somecases succeed while others don’t.There is one other obstacle - time. Like sophrology treatments, sessionsdevoted to healing over distances have to last for at least forty to sixty min-utes, in order to enable a healer to relax completely and be of real help. As weknow, people are more and more pressed for time these days. Being easy-"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Healing Over DistancesPage 215going has gone out of fashion, as the monetary value of our time keeps steadilyrising.What conditions are necessary to practice healing over distances?• Being in the alpha state.• Being able to visualize the symbolic healing process, which varies dependingon the case, and is generally revealed to the healer by his or her subconscious.• Knowing how to use positive formulations like the following: “I am learninghow to transmute an imperfection or malfunction of the body or mind intoperfect balance and health.”Here is an outline of what takes place on the third and final day of analpha seminar. The various exercises correspond to the chapters of the thirdpart of this book, and are designed to train participants to use their paranor-mal faculties:Day 3 (all day Sunday):• creation of a mental laboratory;• training assistants;• simple exteriorization exercises, followed by more complex ones, culminatingin participants’ ability to intuitively perceive one another’s thoughts, and es-tablish some kind of verifiable telepathic dialog;• diagnosis over distance exercise (based on Edgar Cayce’s technique);• an attempt at healing over distances;• exteriorization experiment.The aim of these exercises is not to turn all the participants into medi-ums, but to demonstrate that they all possess some degree of paranormalability, which can be developed if they choose, through regular practice."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 216The Dangers ofParapsychologyPsychology Magazine published the following letter-to-the-editor in itsJanuary, 1975 issue: “I was very interested by an article that appeared in yourmagazine (No. 56, January 1974) entitled ‘I attended an alpha seminar.’ I de-cided to find out for myself what really takes place during this kind of con-ference.“I mentioned my intention to a number of friends. Some were open to theidea of parapsychology and encouraged me, while others were obviouslyskeptical and poked fun at me. There were quite a few cynics actually. Onefriend, a psychiatrist by profession, and someone I had known since child-hood, made no effort to hide his aversion for anything that even hinted of theparanormal. He felt it was important to take the time to explain, very pa-tiently, why this kind of attraction for the paranormal was actually a mani-festation of a schizoid personality.“He tried to get me to change my mind, saying that the people who at-tended such seminars were all borderline mental cases - middle aged womenwho had nothing better to do than pay to have their fortunes read everyweek, imbeciles who believed aliens were planning to invade Earth, fanaticswho tried to read the future in teacups, and so on. He said they were all moreor less hysterical, and that all the mumbo-jumbo somehow compensated forwhatever was lacking in their sad lives.“I didn’t let my friend and his condescending attitude dissuade me. Iwould embark on the adventure, and find out for myself, which is exactlywhat happened two weeks later.”"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 217The letter went on to describe the author’s experience with mental diag-nosis and healing. She insisted that the phenomenon could not have beencaused by direct transmission of thoughts because certain details, which wereunknown to the persons present at the session, were shown to be accuratelater on.“However,” the writer added, “the most important aspect of the seminarfor me is kind of hard to talk about because it concerns my own personalexperience rather than some objectively verifiable phenomenon like healing.What I’m trying to explain is what the seminar did for me, in terms of devel-oping my personality. Call it whatever you want - the power of suggestion,self hypnosis, it doesn’t matter. The fact is, I came out of the seminar with thefeeling that I have this amazing tool at my disposal, something that can reallyhelp me change the things I believe are wrong with me. I can make use of thisnewly discovered aspect of my mind to attain whatever goals I set for myself,and get results even without making any special effort. I wouldn’t go so faras to say that my life has been transformed, but I would say that both myprivate and professional life, my relations with other people, and especiallythe way I see myself, underwent a drastic change, almost from one day to thenext. I believe this change is very positive.“There is one thing I feel I should warn your readers about. It’s so easy tofall into the trap of thinking that the seminar is going to endow you withsome kind of special mysterious power, that it gives you the right to do what-ever you want. It’s also easy to start feeling superior to other people, sinceyou come out with a heightened awareness of the power of dreams and ofyour subconscious.“But as I said, the aspect that was most important for me turned out to besomething much simpler than that. What the seminar did for me was showme how to exercise greater control over myself, and develop my own poten-tial. It may not sound like much, but in my opinion it has made all the differ-ence in the world, as far as my personal happiness is concerned.”Mrs. M.M."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 218Mrs. M’s warning is important. Courses that teach people how to de-velop their paranormal faculties always seem to attract one or two weirdoeswho are trying to find some justification for their aberrant behavior. Dr. HubertLarcher, one of the founders of the International Metapsychic Institute, toldme that he had received a flood of demands from people who wanted medi-cal certificates condoning their mental instability, on the grounds that theywere under the influence of some sort of parapsychological phenomena.PredispositionWhen people who are mentally unbalanced become attracted to para-psychology, the practices they engage in cannot be considered the cause oftheir problem, since the problem already existed before.On the other hand, persons who are predisposed to madness may be-come mentally unstable after being introduced to various paranormal phe-nomena. This was not unusual at the turn of the century, during the so-calledgolden age of occultism, when all kinds fantastic theories were jumbled to-gether without any thought to order or validity. People who could not maketheir own distinctions as to what was authentic and what was pure fancy,sometimes did go insane.“I remember one particularly striking case concerning a young militaryofficer who had exhibited schizophrenic tendencies since childhood. Hispsychosis exploded into full-blown schizophrenia during a seance where theparticipants were trying to levitate a table.”Pondering whether there might or might not be life after death will notdrive someone insane. However, taking part in magic rituals, appealing tosuperhuman forces or believing in a spirit world can produce hallucinationsand lead to madness. It is as if some people become possessed, the victims oftheir own fantasies.Weak minded persons seek situations which allow them to act out theirmental imbalances. In other words, being predisposed to madness, they lookfor ways to fulfill their potential for insanity. They may find acceptable ways"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 219to channel their unbalanced energy, at least for awhile, by joining an extrem-ist organization or a mystical sect like the Church of Scientology. But in thelong run, such people are likely to lose touch with reality altogether.That is one of the reasons why followers of the occult sciences consideredit necessary to disguise their teachings by using highly esoteric terminology,inaccessible to the common person. Only after a long process of initiation,during which those who were found lacking were weeded out, would mas-ters impart their knowledge to disciples whom they deemed ready.All parapsychology does is displace the normally accepted boundariesbetween what is considered real and imaginary. By applying a scientificmethod to the study of the irrational, it tries to shed new light on a number ofphenomena which mankind has not yet been able to comprehend.Parapsychology is gaining in popularity at a time when the general levelof education of the population as a whole is rising dramatically, the result ofan increased awareness of the importance of education, better teaching facili-ties and methods, and the explosion of mass communication technology.Nevertheless, people who tend to be highly emotional or generally un-stable should exercise great prudence in their approach to the study of para-psychology. Such persons should learn to control their own emotions beforetrying to master any of the paranormal techniques outlined in this book.Magic and behaviorWhen people get involved with the occult, they tend to minimize theimportance of logic and interpret events in light of certain symbols, oftengiving them divine significance. B.F. Skinner, the world renowned Americanpsychologist offers this explanation:In one of his experiments, Skinner kept a number of hungry pigeons lockedup in a cage for twelve hours. An automated device dropped a few grains offood into the cage at regular intervals. At the end of the twelve hour period,Skinner noticed that most of the pigeons were behaving strangely. Some kept"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 220raising one foot off the ground, others beat the air with only one wing, and soon. Skinner wondered what the cause might be.He theorized that at the start of the experiment, food must have droppedinto the cage when each bird was making a specific movement. Forming asimple cause-and-effect connection, the birds kept repeating the ‘magic’ move-ment, hoping for more food. Because food fell at regular intervals, they wereconvinced that their particular technique worked.Skinner called the experiment ‘the birth of superstition.’People often act much like the pigeons in Skinner’s laboratory. Eventshappen that are thought to have special significance, even though they maybe the result of pure coincidence, giving rise to all kinds of taboos and rituals,from avoiding the cracks on the sidewalk to not opening an umbrella indoorsto praying to the gods to intervene on one’s behalf.If you can’t solve a problem yourself, why not ask the spirits or someonewho reads cards for guidance?There is an obvious fault in reasoning here. An effect is mistakenly linkedto a cause, while the real cause is ignored or misunderstood. Allowing one-self to be convinced by appearances and led astray by subconscious fears ordesires means losing control over your mind.Before being allowed to participate in an alpha seminar, all potential par-ticipants have to fill out a questionnaire, designed to weed out any patho-logical personalities.In addition, the relaxation and self-control exercises which are taughtbefore any actual paranormal phenomena are introduced, help prepare par-ticipants for the mind-altering states they encounter later on. Unlike cult ritualsand other mystical practices, the seminar is intentionally structured to pro-ceed slowly and gradually. Rational functions may be inhibited, but they neverbecome totally inactive, resulting in at least some measure of self control be-ing exercised at all times."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 221The aim is not to allow the intuitive, irrational part of our mind to domi-nate our reason, but rather to create a balance, by reviving our sensibility toaspects of reality that cold logic and reason tend to overlook.The power to do harmSome people are worried about developing their paranormal faculties.Isn’t it dangerous to have the power to read other people’s intimate thoughts,to be able to influence them any way you want?Developing paranormal faculties does not require taking any kind of vowto be good, to avoid doing anything that could be harmful or run counter toyour principles. In any case, since paranormal powers are drawn from thesubconscious, whatever principles you consciously uphold won’t have muchof an influence anyway.Then there’s the question of what is harmful and what isn’t. We could saythat harming people means doing something that causes pain or unhappi-ness, that makes people’s lives more difficult.On the other hand, everyone has their own notion of what harm is. Some-thing that is harmful in the short term might be beneficial over the long term.What is harmful for one person could be beneficial for another.Doing harm means entering into conflict with established rules that wehave been conditioned to accept since childhood. This conditioning lies be-hind the law of ‘karma’ - the notion that any harm you do will irrevocablyreturn to haunt you. Why? Because doing harm will create a strong sense ofsubconscious guilt, which will in turn force you to do things that harm your-self, as a way of expiating your guilt.To be on the safe side, it’s a good idea to reinforce your conscious surveil-lance by repeating a positive formulation like: “As I develop my paranormalfaculties I cannot harm others or myself; the more I try the less I will suc-ceed.”"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 222This injunction will take effect if, by any chance, a subconscious desirearises to develop your paranormal abilities to harm someone. It will also pro-tect you against the negative consequences of that kind of action.Nevertheless, I am convinced that people who really want to use theirparanormal faculties for immoral purposes can do so. Whether they use au-tosuggestion, hypnosis or mental dynamics to do so makes no difference atall. They will find a way if that is what they really want.You can find books about black magic in any library or bookstore (somany people are interested in the so-called black arts that some stores carryonly that type of material). The internet offers hundreds of sites dedicated tothe occult.Hypnotists are careful to propagate the myth that people under hypnosiscannot be forced to do anything that goes against their will or better judge-ment. In fact a skilled and determined hypnotist can make his subjects domore or less whatever he wants. Jules Liegeois, a professor of law in France,and a friend of Bernheim (a famous hypnotist), suggested a series of experi-ments to test that very theory.Here is an excerpt from his report:Intending to see just how much the power of suggestion could affect asubject we will refer to as C., Bernheim set up the following, highly dramaticsituation: C. was told that a person who was standing in front of the door (infact there was no one there) had gravely insulted him. A pseudo weapon wasplaced in his hand (a letter opener) and he was ordered to kill the man. C.immediately rushed forward, raised the weapon and resolutely planted it inthe door. He stood there, trembling, with a wild look in his eye. “What haveyou done!” Berhneim cried. “You’ve killed him! Look, his blood is pouringout of the wound. The police are on their way.” C. just stood there, terrified.We took him into another room and introduced him to his lawyer (actuallyBernheim’s assistant).“Why did you kill this man?” the lawyer asked."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 223“He insulted me.”“You don’t kill someone just because they insulted you. You should havegone to the police. Did anyone tell you to kill him?”“It was Mr. Bernheim.”Bernheim turned to him and said, “You killed the man. I didn’t tell you todo it. You did it on your own! You’re going to have to appear before a judge.”We led C. into another room where a colleague of Bernheim’s played therole of judge.“Why did you kill this man?”“Because he insulted me.”“That’s strange. You don’t knife someone to death just because they in-sulted you. Were you on some kind of drug? I have been told that you havemental problems. Is that true?”“No, Your Honor!”“Were you in full possession of your faculties at the time? Maybe youwere sleepwalking. Or maybe someone else forced you to do it?”“No, I did it on my own, because he insulted me.”“Think about what you’re saying. Your life is at stake here. Tell me whoput you up to this. It’s in your own best interest. You told your lawyer thatMr. Bernheim forced you to commit the murder. Is that true?”“No, Your Honor, I acted on my own.”"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Dangers of ParapsychologyPage 224“You know who Mr. Bernheim is, don’t you? You go to his office at thehospital, and he hypnotizes you, doesn’t he?”“I only know Mr. Bernheim because he gives me my shock treatments atthe hospital. I have a problem with my nerves, and he treats me for it. Otherthan that I don’t know anything about him. I can’t say that he told me to killthe man, because he didn’t.”It was impossible for the judge to get the truth out of the subject becauseof the last suggestion Bernheim had made, i.e. that he had acted on his own.The significance of this experiment, both from a legal and medical point ofview, is fascinating.Other experiments conducted by Bernheim (involving poisoning, the sign-ing of false documents, and so on) provided similar results. Some might ob-ject that this all happened a long time ago (before the turn of the century),and that it could not possibly happen today.Well, consider the case of Wolf Messing, a modern day telepathist livingin Russia, who was able to escape from prison simply by suggesting that hisguards lock themselves in his cell!It is also possible to create emotional situations that force subjects underhypnosis to override their moral principles (saving a child, for example, oravenging the murder of a spouse). This disproves the notion that hypnotizedpersons cannot commit acts that run contrary to their conscience.Police organizations around the world have files on people who havecommitted crimes while under hypnosis. Like nuclear energy, the power ofsuggestion and other paranormal faculties can be used for good or for evil.Should we, then, refuse to use them altogether?

Place a small pillow under the nape of your neck. Arms should beloosely extended by your sides, palms facing downward. Feet should be al-lowed to fall to the sides (Figure 1).You can also sit on a comfortable easy chair. Ideally your arms shouldform a 135 angle with your shoulders as they rest on the arms of the chair(this position being the most conducive to relaxation). Your feet should becompletely flat on the floor, your neck and head well supported (use a cush-ion if necessary). Knees should be spread apart to allow the thigh muscles torelax (Figure 2).If you can’t lie on the floor, and if you don’t have the right kind of chair,you can sit on a stool, allowing your body to slump forward.

I don’t want you to try and fall asleep. I am telling you to closeyour eyes so you can concentrate without being distracted by anything youmight see. Now tell yourself that everything I am going to say will be re-corded by your brain, engraved in your mind. And that, without your know-ing it, without any effort on your part, your organism and your entire beingwill obey what your subconscious mind tells you to do.The first thing I am going to tell you is that every day, three times a day,morning, noon and evening, at mealtimes, you will feel hungry. You will ex-perience the pleasant sensation of feeling slightly hungry and think, “Mm,I’d love to have something to eat!” And you will eat, savoring every mouth-ful, enjoying your food immensely, without eating too much. You’ll be care-ful to chew your food well, transforming it into a soft paste in your mouthbefore you swallow. This will help you digest well, so that you will feel abso-lutely no discomfort in your stomach or intestines afterwards, no pain orheartburn, no discomfort at all. Your body will digest and assimilate the foodyou ingest perfectly, using all the nutrients it contains to renew your supplyof blood, muscles, energy - in short, to regenerate life.Because you digest your food well, your intestines will function normallyand effectively.

Your bowel movements will be normal and satis-fying, and you won’t need the help of any kind of medication or artificialstimulant.Every night, from the moment you want to go to sleep to the momentyou wake up in the morning, you will be able to sleep deeply and calmly,without having any bad dreams. When you wake up in the morning you willfeel fresh and fully rested, ready to enjoy the day.If you sometimes feel sad or depressed, if you sometimes get bored orworry too much, you can rest assured that you won’t have those kinds offeelings any more. Instead of feeling sad or depressed, instead of worrying,you will feel happy, very happy, for no reason at all, in the same way that youmay have felt sad for no reason from time to time. From now on you’ll feelhappy and joyous inside. And even if you have real cause to worry or feelsad, you won’t fall into depression. You will do what has to be done, nour-ished by the joy and happiness of being alive.If you sometimes became impatient or angry in the past, you won’t anymore. From now on you will have infinite patience, you’ll always be able tocontrol your anger. You will no longer be bothered by the things that used toirritate or upset you in the past.If you sometimes find yourself thinking terrible things, things that areunhealthy for you, fears, phobias, temptations, hateful thoughts, rest assuredthat these kinds of thoughts will arise less and less frequently in your mind.And whenever they do, they will melt away, like clouds dissolving in a clearsky, until they disappear completely.

You should knowthat this unshakable confidence in yourself is absolutely indispensable for allhuman beings. Without self confidence you’ll never amount to anything, withit you can do anything you want, within reason. Your self confidence will getstronger day by day. It will provide you with the certitude that, not only areyou able to do things well, you are able to do whatever you want - and what-ever it is your duty to do - extremely well, on condition, of course, that whatyou want is within the bounds of reason.So whenever you want to do something, or when you have some duty tofulfil, always remember that the task will be easy for you.

Prolonged stresscauses the nervous system to become hyperactive, and eventually break downor ‘burn out.’ Most so-called psychosomatic illnesses are the result of stress-induced tension and anxiety.We could assume that learning to control stress by being able to induce acertain hypo-metabolic state (as opposed to a hyper-metabolic state) wouldbe beneficial for both a person’s physical health and mental stability.As Professor Gastaut, an expert in electroencephalogram technology (anda highly publicized detractor of the alpha seminar concept) stated himself,“... a hypo-metabolic state is always characterized by modifications in elec-troencephalogram readings, notably by an increased incidence of alphawaves.”It should not be surprising that researchers became interested in alphawaves, as a possible way of teaching people how to relax. Various approachesand devices were tried, including biofeedback machines, techniques basedon existing relaxation and meditation methods, drugs, etc.Of course the idea has led to some exploitation, especially in the UnitedStates, where all kinds of biofeedback and alpha-wave-generating deviceshave begun popping up in local pharmacies. But that does not mean the wholealpha wave theory should be thrown out the window. Professor Gastaut mayremember how opposed people were to the idea of blood transfusions, whendoctors first started performing them back in the 1920’s."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Appendix III : The Alpha ControversyPage 236There is a long list of discoveries that have been violently opposed bysome of the greatest figures in the history of science and government. We canunderstand why the professor may think that alpha waves are his privatedomain, and that no one else has the right to use them for purposes which hemay find unusual.He may justify this kind of emotional reaction by saying that it is impos-sible for people to attain, in just a few alpha sessions, what practitioners ofmore traditional methods took years to achieve. He may overlook the factthat the slowing down of metabolism associated with the emission of alphabrain waves allows people to attain the same state in a very short time. Thepartial cessation of neo-cortex functions makes subjects extremely open tosuggestion, allowing them to influence and control parts of their subconsciousthat would otherwise remain inaccessible. This is exactly what the Mind Con-trol technique, which has become so popular in the U.S., is designed to do."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Appendix III : The Alpha ControversyPage 237In France alone, over 1500 therapists practice sophrology. Is ProfessorGastaut of the opinion that they are all charlatans?Should we wait another twenty or thirty years before we start exploringthe potential of paranormal phenomena and the discovery of alpha waves, ashappened with other, equally important, discoveries in the past?Needless to say, the alpha theory should not be used to exploit a credu-lous and hopeful public. The alpha state is a tool, not an end in itself. Claim-ing that devices can perform miracles simply by teaching people to enter thealpha state is exploitation, pure and simple. But to say that alpha waves areuseless, that the exploration of unknown mental faculties is a waste of time,is just as harmful.We may deplore people who try to ‘make a fast buck’ out of anything thepublic finds new or interesting. Professor Gastaut may be indignant that hisbeloved electroencephalogram is being used to generate more profit for oth-ers than for himself. But the world is changing. Those who will form the newelite are those who are enthusiastic about developing new ideas and perfect-ing old ones. In short, those who encourage progress. They are not victims, oroverly credulous, or naive. They come from all fields of endeavor - psycholo-gists, executives, doctors, researchers, students, mothers of families. And theyoften approach us after seeing what mental dynamics has done do for some-one they know. They feel they can place their trust in us, that we can be theirfriends.

GodefroyAlpha Seminar Instructor"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 238Appendix IV : PracticalExercises inPsychocyberneticsThe mental screenThe first thing you should do is develop your concentration and visual-ization skills by practicing the mental screen exercise. To induce the alphastate, you can tape the text on pg. — of this book, or order a pre-taped cas-sette from the publisher.Step 1 : visual concentrationGet comfortable, either siting in a chair or cross-legged on the floor. Cutout the black rectangle on the opposite page and set it in front of you, at heartlevel, about 20 inches from your eyes. You can glue the rectangle to a whitesheet of cardboard and then lean it against something so it will stand on itsown (on a table or stool to get the right height).Start by relaxing. Breath slowly and deeply. Make sure to relax all thesmall muscles around your eyes, as well as your jaw and your tongue.When you feel relaxed, concentrate on the black rectangle for ten breaths.If your eyes start to water or itch, close them for the rest of the ten breathcycle.Look only at the rectangle, and don’t let your vision get blurred."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 239Repeat the ten breath cycle four times.Do the exercise once a day. After a few days, when you have mastered thetechnique of visual concentration, move on to the next step.Step 2: Visual concentration without blinkingGet comfortable in the same position you were in for the previous exer-cise. Start by relaxing. Do some deep breathing, making sure to breath fromyour abdomen.Relax the muscles around your eyes and in your eyelids, as well as yourjaw and tongue muscles. (Whenever you feel tense, try to relax your tongue,and not let it press against your upper palate.)Now concentrate on the black rectangle and try not to blink for ten fullbreaths. If your eyes start to get tired or itchy, close them until the end of theten breath cycle. Keep staring at the black rectangle, and don’t let your visionblur.Repeat the ten breath cycle five times (make sure to rest your eyes be-tween each cycle).Do the exercise once a day. When you have mastered it, move on to thenext step.Step 3 : Concentrated thinkingAn untrained mind is like a wild horse. It runs this way and that, andresists all attempts to be tamed. This exercise will help you learn to controlyour mind. You have already improved your concentration by practicing thevisual exercises described above. Now it’s time to control your mental activ-ity."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 240Get comfortable and relax, as before. This time, as you stare at the blackrectangle, try to prevent your thoughts as well as your line of vision, fromwandering. Concentrate on every detail of the rectangle, the way the blackbackground seems to assume different colors, the exact shape of the rect-angle, the kind if paper it’s on, the ink that forms the rectangle, and so on.Be careful not to let your mind start wandering off in a series of associa-tions (for example, rectangle - geometry - school - children - vacation - sun -beach, etc.). Just stay focussed on the rectangle, and if thoughts arise, let themgo instead of clinging to them.Continue concentrating for ten full breaths, and repeat five times a day.When you feel you have mastered the technique, move on to the next exer-cise.Step 4 : visualizing a rectangleVisualizing means using the power of thought to create a mental image(some people equate this kind of inner vision with the mystical third eye).When you imagine what your next vacation will be like, or when yourecall scenes from memory, you are visualizing.Everyone has the ability to visualize. The key is to develop that abilityand apply it in interesting and beneficial ways.To do that, you are going to repeat the previous exercise, and then, at theend of each ten breath cycle, you are going to close your eyes and imaginethat the rectangle is still there in front of you. Hold the image in your mindfor as long as you can.Important: if you stare at a light bulb for a couple of seconds and thenclose your eyes, an image of the light bulb remains engraved on your retina,so that you keep seeing it for some seconds. This occurs because of some-thing called the phosphene effect on your retina."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 241Visualizing is different. Don’t stare at the after image of the black rect-angle after closing your eyes. Instead, let your mind reproduce the image,locating it about an inch and a half above your eyelids, in a medium close-upframe.Don’t be alarmed if the rectangle becomes distorted or starts to disap-pear - that is perfectly normal. Be patient and keep trying until you can visu-alize the rectangle easily, and hold it for at least two full breaths.Step 5: transforming the rectangle into a mentalscreenRepeat the previous exercise, and this time try to transform the rectangleinto a giant movie or TV screen. Make it as big as possible. Repeat two orthree times.Whenever you visualize the screen, get into the habit of moving yourindex finger, as if you were changing channels on a remote control (the con-ditioned reflex will help you visualize better).How to visualize the colors of the rainbowVisualize a series of colored objects, one by one, holding each object onyour mental screen for two full breaths. For red you could visualize a tomato;for orange, an orange; for yellow, a lemon; for green, a field of grass; for blue,the sky; for indigo (dark purple), a plum, and for violet, an amethyst.Try to concentrate on the color violet for a longer period of time.How to use your mental screen to induce the alphastateSummon up a pleasant and relaxing scene from your past. Everyone hasexperienced moments of complete relaxation and harmony at some time intheir life. Choose a scene from your past that evokes a feeling of peace andtranquillity, and picture it in your mind, in as much detail as possible."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 242It could be a day spent at the seaside, for example. Picture the clear bluesky, the palm fronds wafting in the warm gentle breeze, the foaming breakersrolling towards the sandy beach. Can you hear the sound of the gulls? Thegentle roar of the sea? Do you feel the heat of the sun on your skin? The warmsand supporting your body? Bask in the sensation of well-being the imageevokes and hold the visualization for at least one full minute.Modifying your self imageStart by visualizing yourself on your mental screen. Imagine yourself inas much detail as possible. The important thing is to create an image that islifelike and precise. See yourself as a person who is evolving. Every day, spendthirty minutes visualizing yourself as you engage in positive activities, suc-ceeding at the things you want to accomplish.What you did yesterday has no bearing on who you are today. Nor is itnecessary to pretend that you will become some kind of perfect super beingtomorrow. Your subconscious will take care of your progress on its own, aslong as you keep practicing the exercise.Visualize yourself in action, visualize yourself feeling various emotions,visualize yourself being the person you want to be. Don’t say, “I’m going tobehave in such and such a way tomorrow.” Simply say, “For the next thirtyminutes I am going to imagine myself behaving in such and such a way.”Imagine that you already are the personality you want to become. If youwere timid and fearful in the past, visualize yourself at ease, interacting withpeople, feeling relaxed and good about yourself.If you were anxious or tense in certain situations, visualize yourself inthe same situations, feeling calm, confident and courageous. In time, youwill start to feel that way all the time.This exercise is designed to create new, positive experiences on whichyou can base your future behavior."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 243It takes about 21 days of regular practice before you start seeing results.As the 21 day period draws to an end, you will find yourself acting differ-ently in various situations, without having to make any effort whatsoever. Infact, you should not try to change at all. Just let it happen.For example, if you want to stop smoking, visualize yourself relaxing,without a cigarette, feeling fine. Imagine yourself refusing when someoneoffers you a cigarette, without feeling the need to smoke at all.Proceed in stages when your objective is difficult. And remember, bringall your senses into play. The more sensory input your subconscious receives,the more real your visualization will appear, and the faster you’ll obtain re-sults.Work on those aspects of your behavior which your conscious mind can-not seem to control. And don’t feel you haven’t accomplished anything justbecause the changes that do eventually occur do not require any effort. Con-centrate on the visualization process, not on the results.How to get rid of allergies, alleviate pain, overcomefear, etc.You can use visualizations to re-program the way your brain associatesthe various types of input it receives. If, for example, the sight of an insect oranimal produces an allergic reaction because of some traumatic experienceyou had as a child, all you have to do is replace the negative association witha positive one.The process may be a little difficult at first. Concentrate on the sensationof well being you want to evoke. Think about the love you had for a dog, forexample, and then associate that image with the image of the insect or animalyou react adversely to. The more you repeat the visualization, the more thepositive association will replace the negative one.For pain, replace the sensation with one of cold or numbness."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Practical Exercises in PsychocyberneticsPage 244First imagine a sensation of cold or numbness in your right hand, thentransfer the sensation to the part of your body that is experiencing pain. Thetechnique, based on sophrology, is called sensory substitution (it is often usedby dentists).It you were traumatized by a past event and want to erase it from yourmemory, relive the event in your mind and visualize it unfolding as you wouldhave wanted it to unfold. Repeat the visualization as many times as is neces-sary in order to replace the negative memory with a positive one.All these psychocybernetic exercises will be of no use unless you answerthe following question first: WHAT DO I WANT? Very few people take thetime to really think about what they want, what their goals in life are. Andyet, knowing what you want is the first, indispensable step in changing yourlife. Take a sheet of paper and write the following question at the top of thepage: WHAT DO I WANT?Make a list of your goals, then choose two or three which are most impor-tant to you, which you can see yourself attaining. Then work on them duringyour sessions.Whenever you emerge from the alpha state, use a positive formulationlike the following: “In a couple of moments I will return to my ordinary stateof consciousness, and open my eyes. When I do I will feel completely alert,my head and neck will feel relaxed, I will feel full of energy and in harmonywith life.”Continue practicing and you will gradually break out of your shell, shedthe cliches and acquired beliefs that are hindering your progress, and be-come the real you, the person you have always known you could be, living alife of harmony and happiness."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"BibliographyPage 245Bibliography(Comments and recommendations are based on the author’s subjectiveevaluation, and in no way reflect opinion of the publisher).Abrezol, Dr. R., Sophrology In Our Society, Inter-Marketing Group (Swit-zerland), 1973.
