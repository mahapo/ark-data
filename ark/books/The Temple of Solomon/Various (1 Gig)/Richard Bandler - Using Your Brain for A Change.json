Expressions like these aremore than metaphors. They are precise descriptions of the speak-er's internal thinking, and these descriptions are the key to learn-ing how to change your own experience in useful ways. Forinstance, right now notice how you picture a pleasant future eventin your own life . • . and then brighten that picture and noticehow your feelings change. When you brighten that picture, doyou \"look forward\" to it more? Most people respond morestrongly to a brighter picture; a few respond more to a dimmerpicture.Now take a pleasant memory from your past and literallymake the colors stronger and more intense. . . . How does havinga \"colorful past\" change the intensity of your response to thatmemory? If you don't notice a difference in your feelings whenyou make your memory more colorful, try seeing that memory inblack and white. As the image loses its color, typically yourresponse will be weaker.Another common expression is, \"Add a little sparkle to yourlife.\" Think of another pleasant experience, and literally sprinkleyour image of it with little shining points of sparkling light, andnotice how that affects your feeling response. (Television adver-tisers and designers of sequined clothing know about this one!)\"Put your past behind you,\" is common advice for unpleasant1"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2 Using Your Brainevents. Think of a memory that still makes you feel bad, andthen notice where you see it now, and how far away the pictureis. Probably it's fairly close in front of you. Now take that pictureand physically move it far behind you. How does that change howyou experience that memory?These are a few very basic examples of the simplicity andpower of the new NLP \"Submodalities\" patterns developed byRichard Bandler in the last few years. One of the earliest NLPpatterns was the idea of \"Modalities\" or \"Representational Sys-tems.\" We think about any experience using sensory system rep-resentations—visual pictures, auditory sounds and kinesthetic feel-ings. Most NLP Training during the last ten years has taught awide variety of rapid and practical ways to use this knowledge ofmodalities to change feelings and behavior. Submodalities are thesmaller elements within each modality. For example, a few of thevisual submodalities are brightness, color, size, distance, location,and focus. Knowledge of Submodalities opens up a whole newrealm of change patterns that are even faster, easier, and morespecific.When we were first introduced to NLP in the fall of 1977,we set aside most of what we were doing in order to study theseexciting and rapid new ways of changing behavior. At that timeRichard Bandler and John Grinder were collaborating on thedevelopment of this new field, which promised a great deal. NLPtaught how to follow a person's internal process by paying atten-tion to unconscious eye movements, how to change old unpleasantfeeling responses in minutes, and much more.Now, seven years later, all those promises and many morehave been kept. All the basic ideas and techniques of NLP havewithstood the test of time, as well as the tougher test of teachingothers how to make practical use of them. NLP has often beendescribed as the field on the cutting edge of communication andchange.NLP offers a conceptual understanding that is solidly basedon information science and computer programming, yet rootedeven more thoroughly in the observation of living human expe-rience. Everything in NLP can be directly verified in your ownexperience, or by observing others."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Introduction 3The new submodality patterns described and taught in thisbook are even faster and more powerful ways of creating personalchange than the earlier NLP methods. There are only three majormodalities, but there are many submodalities within each modality.Submodalities are literally the ways that our brains sort and codeour experience. The submodality change patterns can be used todirectly change the human software—the ways we think aboutand respond to our experiences-Some critics have contended that NLP is too \"cold\" and\"technical,\" and that while it may be successful with simple habitsand phobias, it doesn't deal with \"core existential issues.\" We willbe interested in these critics' responses to the methods for chang-ing understandings and beliefs demonstrated in chapters 6 and 7.This book opens a doorway to a practical new way of under-standing how your mind works. More important, this book teachesspecific simple principles that you can use to \"run your own brain.\"It teaches you how to change your own experience when you'renot pleased with it, and to further enhance your enjoyment whenyour life is going well.Many of us have the ability to take known principles andmake useful adaptations of those principles, or make a smallinnovation now and then. Richard Bandler's special genius is hisunparalleled ability to repeatedly delineate new principles, and tomake them available to the rest of us. His sense of humor maysometimes sound caustic and arrogant, particularly when it isdirected toward the professions of psychology and psychiatry (al-though other \"experts\" get their share!). This is at least partlyunderstandable when you realize that although the NLP 10-minutephobia/trauma cure was first published over six years ago, mostpsychologists continue to believe that it takes months or years oftalking and drugs (and several thousand dollars) to cure a phobia.We know well the frustration of being told, \"It can't be done,\"when we have demonstrated it hundreds of times, and taughtmany others to do it consistently.When a major technical innovation occurs in any industry,manufacturers around the world are eager to make immediate useof the new method, because they know that if they don't, com-petitors will put them out of business. Unfortunately, there is"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"4 Using Your Brainmuch more inertia in fields like psychology, in which professionalsget paid more if they take longer to solve a problem. Sinceincompetence is rewarded, new and better methods take muchlonger to become part of the mainstream in these fields.This inertia in the field of psychology has also been lamentedby many others. Salvador Minuchin, well-known innovator in thefield of family therapy, recently said:\"How did people respond to our (research) findings?By defending their own paradigms. In response to newknowledge, there is always the question of how to main-tain oneself doing the things one was trained in.\"Despite this inertia, there are many exceptions within thefields of psychology and psychiatry—professionals who are eagerto learn about any methods that can benefit their clients by makingtheir work faster, better, and more thorough. We hope this bookfinds its way into your hands.Several years ago we became aware of the new direction thatRichard Bandler's genius was exploring, and we realized howuseful these new patterns could be for people everywhere if theywere more widely known. However, it is primarily our own per-sonal fascination and excitement with submodalities that has ledus to create this book.Our raw materials were audiotapes and transcripts of a largenumber of seminars and workshops that Richard has taught re-cently. Then came a long process of sorting through and organizingthis wealth of material, experimenting with it personally, andteaching it to others in order to gain a richer understanding.Finally, based on what we had learned, we have put this materialtogether in the form of this book. We have tried to preserve theliving style and flavor of the original seminars, while at the sametime reorganizing and sequencing the material to make it easierto understand in written form.Most books in rapidly developing fields are five or ten yearsout of date by the time they are printed. Most of the material inthis book is about three years old. There are many other newer"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction 5submodality patterns now being taught in advanced NLP seminars,and Richard continues to develop more patterns.One of the basic principles of NLP is that the order orsequence of experiences, like the order of words in a sentence,affects their meaning. The order of the chapters in this book hasbeen carefully thought out. Since much of the material in laterchapters presupposes that you have the information and experi-ences presented in earlier chapters, you will have a much fullerunderstanding if you read them in order.Another basic NLP principle is that words are only inadequatelabels for experiences. It is one thing to read about hammeringa nail into a board. It is quite a different experience to feel ahammer in your hand and hear a satisfying \"thunk\" as the nailsinks into a piece of soft pine. It is yet another experience to feelthe vibration and twist in the hammer and watch the nail bendas you hear the \"pinggg\" that tells you about the hidden knot.The patterns in this book are tools. Like any tools, they mustbe used to be understood fully, and they must be practiced to beused with consistent effectiveness. You can skim through this bookrapidly if you just want to get an idea of what's in it. But if youreally want to be able to use this information, be sure to try itout in your own experience and with others, or your knowledgewill only be \"academic.\"Connirae AndreasSteve AndreasApril 1985"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"IWho's Driving the Bus ?Neuro-Linguistic Programming is a word that I made up toavoid having to be specialized in one field or another.; In collegeI was one of those people who couldn't make up my mind, andI decided to continue that way. One of the things that NLPrepresents is a way of looking at human learning. Although lotsof psychologists and social workers use NLP to do what they call\"therapy,\" I think it's more appropriate to describe NLP as aneducational process. Basically we're developing ways to teach ,people how to use their own brains.Most people don't actively and deliberately use their ownbrains. Your brain is like a machine without an \"off' switch. Ifyou don't give it something to do, it just runs on and on until itgets bored. If you put someone in a sensory deprivation tankwhere there's no external experience, he'll start generating internalexperience. If your brain is sitting around without anything to do,it's going to start doing something, and it doesn't seem to carewhat it is, You may care, but it doesn't.For example, have you ever been just sitting around mindingyour own business, or sound asleep, when suddenly your brainflashes a picture that scares the pants off you? How often dopeople wake up in the middle of the night because they justrelived an ecstatically pleasureable experience? If you've had abad day, then later your brain will show you vivid reruns, overand over again. It's not enough that you had a bad day; you can7"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8 Using Your Brainruin the whole evening, and perhaps part of next week, too.Most people don't stop there. How many of you think aboutunpleasant things that happened long ago? It's as if your brain issaying, \"Let's do it again! We've got an hour before lunch, let'sthink about something that's really depressing. Maybe we can getangry about it three years too late.\" Have you heard about \"un-finished business\"? It's finished; you just didn't like the way itcame out.I want you to find out how you can learn to change yourown experience, and get some control over what happens in yourbrain. Most people are prisoners of their own brains. It's as ifthey are chained to the last seat of the bus and someone else isdriving. I want you to learn how to drive your own bus. If youdon't give your brain a little direction, either it will just runrandomly on its own, or other people will find ways to run it foryou—and they may not always have your best interests in mind.Even if they do, they may get it wrong!NLP is an opportunity to be able to study subjectivity—something that I was told in school is a terrible thing. I wastold that true science looks at things objectively. However, Inoticed that I seemed to be most influenced by my subjectiveexperience, and I wanted to know something about how it worked,and how it affected other people. I'm going to play some mind-games with you in this seminar, because the brain is my favoritetoy.How many of you would like to have a \"photographic mem-ory\"? And how many of you vividly remember past unpleasantexperiences, over and over again? It certainly adds a little juiceto life. If you go to see a terrifying movie, and you go home andsit down, the act of sitting down will tend to put you right backinto the theater seat. How many of you have had that experience?And you claim that you don't have a photographic memory!You've already got one; you're just not using it in a directed way.If you're able to have a photographic memory when it comes toremembering past unpleasantness, it seems like it would be niceif you could deliberately harness some of that ability for moreuseful experiences.How many of you have ever thought about something that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Who's Driving the Bus? 9hadn't even happened yet, and felt bad about it ahead of time?Why wait? You may as well start feeling bad now, right? Andthen it didn't actually happen, after all. But you didn't miss outon that experience, did you?That ability can also work the other way. Some of you havebetter vacations before you actually go, and then you get to bedisappointed when you arrive. Disappointment requires adequateplanning. Did you ever think about how much trouble you haveto go to in order to be disappointed? You really have to planthoroughly for it. The more planning, the more disappointment.Some people go to the movies and then say, \"It's just not as goodas I thought it was going to be.\" This makes me wonder, if theyhad such a good movie inside their heads, why did they go to thetheater? Why go sit in a room with sticky floors and uncomfortableseats to watch a movie, and then say, \"I can do better than thatin my head, and I didn't even have the screen play.\"This is the kind of thing that happens if you let your brainrun wild. People spend more time learning how to use a foodprocessor than they do learning how to use their brains. Thereisn't much emphasis placed on deliberately using your mind inways other than you already do. 'You're supposed to \"be your-self—as if you had an alternative. You're stuck with it, believeme. I suppose they could wipe out all your memories with elec-troshock, and then make you into someone else, but the resultsI've seen haven't been very enticing. Until we find something likea mind-blanking machine, I think you're probably stuck with you.And it's not so bad, because you can learn to use your brain inmore functional ways. That's what NLP is all about.When I first started teaching, some people got the idea thatNLP would help people program other people's minds to controlthem and make them less human. They seemed to have the ideathat deliberately changing a person would somehow reduce thatperson's humanity. Most people are quite willing to change them-selves deliberately with antibiotics and cosmetics, but behaviorseems different. I've never understood how changing someone andmaking them happier turns them into less of a human being. ButI have noticed how many people arc very good at making theirhusbands or wives or children—or even total strangers—feel bad,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10 Using Your Brainjust by \"being themselves.\" I sometimes ask people, \"Why beyour real self when you can be something really worthwhile?\" Iwant to introduce you to some of the infinite possibilities forlearning and changing that are available to you if you start usingyour brain deliberately.There was a time when film producers made movies in whichcomputers were going to take over. People started thinking ofcomputers not as tools, but as things that replaced people. But ifyou have seen home computers, you know that they have pro-grams for things like balancing your checkbook! Balancing yourcheckbook on a home computer takes about six times as long asdoing it the usual way. Not only do you have to write them inthe checkbook, then you have to go home and type them intothe computer. That's what turns home computers into planters—the things that you put flowers in. You play a certain numberof games when it's a new toy, and after a while you stick it awayin the closet. When friends come over whom you haven't seenfor a long time, you pull it out so they can play the games you'rebored with. That is not really what a computer is about. But thetrivial ways people have used computers are much like the trivialways in which people have used their own minds.1 keep hearing people say that you stop learning when you'reabout five, but I have no evidence that this is true. Stop andthink about it. Between the ages of five and now, how manyabsolutely futile things have you learned, let alone worthwhileones? Human beings have an amazing ability to learn. I amconvinced, and I'm going to convince you—one way or theother—that you're still a learning machine. The good side of thisis that you can learn things exquisitely and rapidly. The bad sideis that you can learn garbage just as easily as you can learn usefulthings.How many of you are haunted by thoughts? You say toyourself, \"I wish I could get it out of my head.\" But isn't itamazing that you got it in there in the first place! Brains arereally phenomenal. The things they'll get you to do are absolutelyamazing. The problem with brains is not that they can't learn, aswe have been told all too often. The problem with brains is thatthey learn things too quickly and too well. For example, think of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Who's Driving the Bus? 11a phobia. It's an amazing thing to be able to remember to getterrified every time you see a spider. You never find a phobiclooking at a spider and saying, \"Oh damn, I forgot to be afraid.\"Are there a few things you'd like to learn that thoroughly? When: you think about it that way, having a phobia is a tremendouslearning achievement. And if you go into the person's history,you often find that it was one-trial learning: it took only oneinstantaneous experience for that person to learn something sothoroughly that she'll remember it for the rest of her life.How many of you have read about Pavlov and his dogs andthe bell, and all that stuff? . . . and how many of you are salivatingright now? They had to put the dog in a harness and ring thebell and give it food over and over again to teach it that response.All you did was read about it, and you have the same responsethe dog had. It's no big thing, but it is an indication of howrapidly your brain can learn. You can learn faster than any com-puter. What we need to know more about is the subjective ex-perience of learning, so that you can direct your learning andhave more control over your own experience and what you learn.Are you familiar with the \"our song\" phenomenon? Duringa period of time when you were with someone very special, youhad a favorite song you listened to a lot. Now whenever you hearthat song, you think of that person and feel those good feelingsagain. It works just like Pavlov and salivation. Most people haveno idea how easy it is to link experiences in that way, or howquickly you can make it happen if you do it systematically.I once saw a therapist create an agoraphobic in one session.This therapist was a nice, well-intentioned man who liked hispatients. He had years of clinical training, but he had no ideawhat he was doing. His client came in with a specific phobia ofheights. The therapist told this guy to close his eyes and thinkabout heights, Urrp—the guy flushes and starts to tremble. \"Nowthink of something that would reassure you.\" Ummn. Now thinkabout heights. Urrp. \"Now think about comfortably driving yourcar.\" Ummn. \"Now think about heights.\" Urrp. . . .This guy ended up having phobic feelings about nearly every-thing in his life—what's often called agoraphobia. What the ther-apist did was brilliant, in a way. He changed his client's feelings"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"12 Using Your Brainby linking experiences. His choice of a feeling to generalize isnot my idea of the best choice, however. He linked this man'sfeelings of panic to all the contexts that used to be reassuring inhis life. You can use exactly the same process to take a goodfeeling and generalize it in the same way If that therapist hadunderstood the process he was using, he could have turned itaround.I've seen the same thing happen in couple therapy. The wifestarts complaining about something the husband did, and thetherapist says, \"Look at your husband while you say that. You'vegot to have eye contact.\" That will connect all those bad feelingsto the sight of her husband's face, so that every time she looksat him, she'll have those bad feelings.Virginia Satir uses the same process in family therapy, butshe turns it around. She asks a couple about special times in theirearly courting days, and when they start glowing, then she hasthem look at each other. She might say something like, \"And Iwant you to realize that this is the same person you fell so deeplyin love with ten years ago.\" That connects an entirely differentfeeling—generally a much more useful one—to the spouse's face.One couple that came to see me had been in therapy withsomeone else for some time, but they still fought. They used tofight all the time at home, but when they came to me, they onlyfought in the therapist's office. The therapist probably said some-thing like, \"Now I want you to save all your fights for our sessionstogether so I can observe how you do it.\"I wanted to find out if fighting was linked to the therapist orhis office, so I had them experiment. I found out that if theywent to the therapist's office when he wasn't there, they didn'targue, but if he held a session at their home, they did argue. SoI just told them not to see that therapist any more. It was asimple solution that saved them a lot of money and trouble.One client of mine couldn't get angry, because he wouldimmediately get extremely scared. You could say he had a phobiaof being angry. It turned out that when he was a child, any timehe got mad, his parents got furious and scared him into the middleof next week, so those two feelings got linked together. He was"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Who's Driving the Bus? 13own and hadn't lived with his parents for fifteen years, but hestill responded that way.I came to the world of personal change from the world ofmathematics and information science. Computer people typicallydon't want the things in their field to have anything to do withpeople. They refer to that as \"getting your hands dirty.\" They liketo work with shiny computers and wear white lab jackets. But Ifound out that there is no better representation of the way inwhich my mind works—especially in terms of limitations—than acomputer. Trying to get a computer to do something—no matterhow simple—is much like trying to get a person to do something.Most of you have seen computer games. Even the simplestones are quite difficult to program, because you have to use thevery limited mechanisms the machine has for communication.When you instruct it to do something that it can do, your instruc-tion has to be precisely organized in such a way that the infor-mation can be processed so that the computer can perform thetask. Brains, like computers, are not \"user-friendly.\" They doexactly what they're told to do, not what you want them to do.Then you get mad at them because they don't do what you meantto tell them to do!One programming task is called modeling, which is what Ido. The task of modeling is to get a computer to do somethingthat a human can do. How do you get a machine to evaluatesomething, do a math problem, or turn a light on or off at theright time? Human beings can turn a light on and off, or do amath problem. Some do it well, others do it well sometimes, andsome don't do it well at all. A modeler attempts to take the bestrepresentation for the way a person does a task, and make itavailable in a machine. I don't care if that representation reallyis how people do the task. Modelers don't have to have truth.All we have to have is something that works. We are the peoplewho make cookbooks. We don't want to know why it is a chocolatecake, we want to know what to put in it to make it come outright. Knowing one recipe doesn't mean there aren't lots of otherways to do it. We want to know how to get from the ingredientsto chocolate cake in a step-by-step fashion. We also want to knownow to take chocolate cake and work backwards to the ingredients"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"14 Using Your Brainwhen someone doesn't want us to have the recipe.Breaking down information in this way is the task of aninformation scientist. The most interesting information that youcan learn about is the subjectivity of another human being. Ifsomebody can do something, we want to model that behaviorand our models are of subjective experience. \"What does she doinside her head that I can learn to do?\" I can't instantly have heryears of experience and the fine tuning which that produces, butI can very rapidly get some great information about the structureof what she does.When I first started modeling, it seemed logical to find outwhat psychology had already learned about how people think,But when I looked into psychology, I discovered that the fieldconsisted primarily of a huge number of descriptions about howpeople were broken. There were a few vague descriptions of whatit meant to be a \"whole person,\" or \"actualized,\" or \"integrated,\"but mostly there were descriptions about the various ways in whichpeople were broken.The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual HI used bypsychiatrists and psychologists has over 450 pages of descriptionsof how people can be broken, but not a single page describinghealth. Schizophrenia is a very prestigious way to be broken;catatonia is a very quiet way. Although hysterical paralysis wasvery popular during World War I, it's out of style now; you onlyfind it occasionally in very poorly-educated immigrants who areout of touch with the times. You're lucky if you can find onenow. I've only seen five in the past seven years, and two of themI made myself, using hypnosis. \"Borderline\" is a very popularway to be broken right now. That means you're not quite nuts,but not quite normal, either—as if anyone isn't! Back in thefifties, after The Three Faces of Eve, multiple personalities alwayshad three. But since Sybil, who had seventeen personalities, we'reseeing more multiples, and they all have more than three.If you think I'm being hard on psychologists, just wait. Yousee, we people in the field of computer programming are so crazythat we can pick on anyone. Anybody who will sit in front of acomputer for twenty-four hours a day, trying to reduce experiencedown to zeros and ones, is so far outside the world of normal"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Who's Driving the Bus? 15an experience that I can say someone is crazy and still beLong ago I decided that since I couldn't find anyone whowas as crazy as I was, people must not really be broken. WhatI've noticed since then is that people work perfectly. I may notlike what they do, or they may not like it, but they are able todo it again and again, systematically. It's not that they're broken;they're just doing something different from what we, or they,want to have happen.If you make really vivid images in your mind—especially ifyou can make them externally—you can learn how to be a civilengineer or a psychotic. One pays better than the other, but it'snot as much fun. What people do has a structure, and if you canfind out about that structure, you can figure out how to changeit. You can also think of contexts where that structure would bea perfect one to have. Think of procrastination. What if you usedthat skill to put off feeling bad when someone insults you? \"Oh,I know I ought to feel bad now, but I'll do it later.\" What if youdelayed eating chocolate cake and ice cream forever—you justnever quite got around to it.However, most people don't think that way. The underlyingbasis of most psychology is \"What's wrong?\" After a psychologisthas a name for what's wrong, then he wants to know when youbroke and what broke you. Then he thinks he knows why youbroke.If you assume that someone is broken, then the next task isto figure out whether or not he can be fixed. Psychologists havenever been very interested in how you broke, or how you continueto maintain the state of being broken.Another difficulty with most psychology is that it studiesbroken people to find out how to fix them. That's like studyingall the cars in a junkyard to figure out how to make cars runbetter. If you study lots of schizophrenics, you may learn how todo schizophrenia really well, but you won't learn about the thingsthey can't do.When I taught the staff of a mental hospital, I suggested thatthey study their schizophrenics only long enough to find out whatthey couldn't do. Then they should study normal people to find"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"16 Using Your Brainout how they do the same things, so they could teach that to theschizophrenics.For example, one woman had the following problem: If shemade up something in her mind, a few minutes later she couldn'tdistinguish that from a memory of something that had actuallyhappened. When she saw a picture in her mind, she had no wayof telling if it was something she had actually seen, or if it wassomething she had imagined. That confused her, and scared herworse than any horror movie. I suggested to her that when shemade up pictures, she put a black border around them, so thatwhen she remembered them later they'd be different from theothers. She tried it, and it worked fine—except for the picturesshe had made before I told her to do that. However, it was agood start. As soon as I told her exactly what to do, she coulddo it perfectly. Yet her file was about six inches thick with twelveyears of psychologists' analyses and descriptions of how she wasbroken. They were looking for the \"deep hidden inner meaning.\"They had taken too many poetry and literature classes. Changeis a lot easier than that, if you know what to do.Most psychologists think it's hard to communicate with crazypeople. That's partly true, but it's also partly a result of whatthey do with crazy people. If someone is acting a little strange,he is taken off the streets, pumped full of tranquilizers and putin a locked barracks with thirty others. They observe him for 72hours and say, \"Gosh, he's acting weird.\" The rest of us wouldn'tact weird, I suppose.How many of you have read the article \"Sane People inInsane Places\"? A sociologist had some healthy, happy, graduatestudents admit themselves to mental hospitals as an experiment.They were all diagnosed as having severe problems. Most of themhad a lot of trouble getting out again, because the staff thoughttheir wanting to get out was a demonstration of their illness. Talkabout a \"Catch-22\"! The patients recognized that these studentsweren't crazy, but the staff didn't.Some years ago when I was looking around at differentchange methods, most people considered psychologists and psy-chiatrists to be experts on personal change. I thought many ofthem were much better demonstrations of psychosis and neurosis."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Who's Driving the Bus? 17Have you ever seen an id? How about an infantile libidinalreaction-formation? Anybody who can talk like that has no busi-ness calling other people nuts.Many psychologists think catatonics are really tough, becausecan't get them to communicate with you. They just sit in thesame position without even moving until someone moves them.It's actually very easy to get a catatonic to communicate with you.All you have to do is hit him on the hand with a hammer. Whenyou lift the hammer to hit him again, he'll pull his hand awayand say, \"Don't do that to me!\" That doesn't mean he's \"cured,\"but he's now in a state where you can communicate with him.That's a start.At one time I asked local psychiatrists to send me the weirdclients they were having difficulties with. I found out that reallyweird clients are easier to work with, in the long run. I think it'seasier to work with a flaming schizophrenic than it is to get a\"normal\" person to stop smoking when he doesn't want to. Psy-chotics seem to be unpredictable, and seem to flip in and out oftheir craziness unexpectedly. However, like anything else thatpeople do, psychosis has a systematic structure. Even a schizo-phrenic doesn't wake up one day as a manic-depressive. If youlearn how that structure works, you can flip him in and out. Ifyou learn it well enough, you can even do it yourself. If you everwant to get a room in a full hotel, there's no better way than byhaving a psychotic episode. But you better be able to get backout of the episode again, or the room you get will be padded.I've always thought that John Rosen's approach to psychosiswas the most useful: enter the psychotic's reality and then spoilit for him. There are a lot of ways you can do this, and some ofthem aren't obvious. For instance, I had one guy who heard avoice coming out of electrical outlets, and the voice forced himto do things. I figured if I made his hallucinations real, he wouldn'tbe schizophrenic any more. So I hid a speaker in an outlet in mywaiting room. When he came into the room, the outlet said\"Hello.\". The guy turned around and looked at it and said, \"Youdon't sound the same.\"\"I'm a new voice. Did you think there was only one?\"Where did you come from?\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"18 Using Your Brain\"Mind your own business.\"That got him going, Since he had to obey the voice, I usedthat new voice to give him the instructions he needed to chancewhat he was doing. Most people get a handle on reality andrespond to it. When I get a handle on reality, I twist it! I don'tbelieve that people are broken. They have just learned to dowhatever they do. A lot of what people have learned to do ispretty amazing, and frankly I see more of that outside of mentalhospitals than inside.Most people's experience is not about reality, it's about sharedreality. There are people who come to my door and give mereligious comic books, and tell me the world is going to end intwo weeks. They talk to angels, and they talk to God, but they'renot considered crazy. But if a single person is caught talking toan angel, he is called crazy, taken to a mental hospital and stuffedfull of drugs. When you make up a new reality, you'd better besure that you get some friends to share it, or you may be in bigtrouble. That's one reason I teach NLP. I want to have at least afew others who share this reality, so the men in white coats don'ttake me away.Physicists also have a shared reality. Other than that, therereally isn't a lot of difference between being a physicist and beinga schizophrenic. Physicists also talk about things you can't see.How many of you have seen an atom, let alone a sub-atomicparticle? There is a difference: physicists are usually a little moretentative about their hallucinations, which they call \"models\" or\"theories.\" When one of their hallucinations is challenged by newdata, physicists are a tiny bit more willing to give up their oldideas.Most of you learned a model of the atom that said there isa nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, with electrons flyingaround the outside like little planets. Niels Bohr got the Nobelprize for that description back in the 1920's. Over a period ofabout 50 years that model was the basis for an immense numberof discoveries and inventions, such as the plastic in those nauga-hyde chairs you're sitting on.Fairly recently, physicists decided that Bohr's description ofthe atom is wrong. I wondered if they were going to take back"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Who's Driving the Bus? 19his Nobel prize, but then I found out Bohr is dead, and he alreadyspent the money. The really amazing thing is that all the discov-eries that were made by using a \"wrong\" model are still here.The Naugahyde chairs didn't disappear when physicists changedtheir minds. Physics is usually presented as a very \"objective\"science, but I notice that physics changes and the world stays thesame, so there must be something subjective about physics.Einstein was one of my childhood heroes. He reduced physicsto what psychologists call \"guided fantasy,\" but which Einsteinreferred to as a \"thought experiment.\" He visualized what it wouldbe like to ride on the end of a beam of light. And people saythat he was academic and objective! One of the results of thisparticular thought experiment was his famous theory of relativity.NLP differs only in that we deliberately make up lies, inorder to try to understand the subjective experience of a humanbeing. When you study subjectivity, there's no use trying to beobjective. So let's get down to some subjective experience. . . ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"IIRunning Your Own BrainI'd like you to try some very simple experiments, to teachyou a little bit about how you can learn to run your own brain.You will need this experience to understand the rest of this book,so I recommend that you actually do the following brief experi-ments.Think of a past experience that was very pleasant—perhapsone that you haven't thought about in a long time. Pause for amoment to go back to that memory, and be sure that you seewhat you saw at the time that pleasant event happened. You canclose your eyes if that makes it easier to do. ...As you look at that pleasant memory, I want you to changethe brightness of the image, and notice how your feelings changein response. First make it brighter and brighter. . . . Now makeit dimmer and dimmer, until you can barely see it. ... Now makeit brighter again.How does that change the way you feel? There are alwaysexceptions, but for most of you, when you make the picturelighter, your feelings will become stronger. Increasing brightnessusually increases the intensity of feelings, and decreasing bright-ness usually decreases the intensity of feelings.How many of you ever thought about the possibility of in-tentionally varying the brightness of an internal image in orderto feel different? Most of you just let your brain randomly showyou any picture it wants, and you feel good or bad in response.21"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"22 Using Your BrainNow think of an unpleasant memory, something you thinkabout that makes you feel bad. Now make the picture dimmerand dimmer. ... If you turn the brightness down far enough itwon't bother you any more. You can save yourself thousands ofdollars in psychotherapy bills.I learned these things from people who did them alreadyOne woman told me that she was happy all the time; she didn'tlet things get to her. I asked her how she did it, and she said\"Well, those unpleasant thoughts come into my mind, but I justturn the brightness down.\"Brightness is one of the \"submodalities\" of the visual modal-ity. Submodalities are universal elements that can be used tochange any visual image, no matter what the content is. Theauditory and kinesthetic modalities also have submodalities, butfor now we'll play with the visual submodalities.Brightness is only one of many things you can vary. Beforewe go on to others, I want to talk about the exceptions to theimpact brightness usually has. If you make a picture so brightthat it washes out the details and becomes almost white, that willreduce, rather than increase, the intensity of your feelings. Usuallythe relationship doesn't hold at the upper extreme. For somepeople, the relationship is reversed in most contexts, so thatincreasing brightness decreases the intensity of their feelings.Some exceptions are related to the content. If your pleasantpicture is candlelight, or twilight, or sunset, part of its specialcharm is due to the dimness; if you brighten the image, yourfeelings may decrease. On the other hand, if you recalled a timewhen you were afraid in the dark, the fear may be due to notbeing able to see what's there. If you brighten that image and seethat there's nothing there, your fear will decrease, rather thanincrease. So there are always exceptions, and when you examinethem, the exceptions make sense, too. Whatever the relationshipis, you can use that information to change your experience.Now let's play with another submodality variable. Pick an-other pleasant memory and vary the size of the picture. Firstmake it bigger and bigger, . . . and then smaller and smaller,noticing how your feelings change in response. . . .The usual relationship is that a bigger picture intensifies your"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Running Your Own Brain 23response, and a smaller picture diminishes it. Again there areexceptions, particularly at the upper end of the scale. When apicture gets very large, it may suddenly seem ridiculous or unreal.Your response may then change in quality instead of intensity- from pleasure to laughter, for instance.If you change the size of an unpleasant picture, you willprobably find that making it smaller also decreases your feelings.If making it really big makes it ridiculous and laughable, then youcan also use that to feel better. Try it. Find out what works forIt doesn't matter what the relationship is, as long as you findout how it works for your brain so that you can learn to controlyour experience. If you think about it, none of this should be atall surprising. People talk about a \"dim future\" or \"bright pros-pects.\" \"Everything looks black.\" \"My mind went blank.\" \"It's asmall thing, but she blows it all out of proportion.\" When someonesays something like that, it's not metaphorical; it's usually a literaland precise description of what that person is experiencing inside.If someone is \"blowing something out of proportion,\" youcan tell her to shrink that picture down. If she sees a \"dim future,\"have her brighten it up. It sounds simple, . . . and it is.There are all these things inside your mind that you neverthought of playing with. You don't want to go messing aroundwith your head, right? Let other people do it instead. All thethings that go on in your mind affect you, and they are allpotentially within your control. The question is, \"Who's going torun your brain?\"Next I want you to go on to experiment with varying othervisual elements, to find out how you can consciously change themto affect your response. I want you to have a personal experientialunderstanding of how you can control your experience. If youactually pause and try changing the variables on the list below,you will have a solid basis for understanding the rest of this book.If you think you don't have the time, put this book down, go tothe back of the bus, and read some comic books or the NationalEnquirer instead.For those of you who really want to learn to run your ownbrain, take any experience and try changing each of the visual"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"24 Using Your Brainelements listed below. Do the same thing you did with brightnessand size: try going in one direction . . . and then the other tofind out how it changes your experience. To really find out how theyour brain works, change only one element at a time. If youchange two or more things at the same time, you won't knowwhich one is affecting your experience, or how much. I recom-mend doing this with a pleasant experience.1) Color. Vary the intensity of color from intense bright colorsto black and white.2) Distance. Change from very close to far away.3) Depth. Vary the picture from a flat, two-dimensional phototo the full depth of three dimensions.4) Duration. Vary from a quick, fleeting appearance to apersistent image that stays for some time,5) Clarity. Change the picture from crystal-clear clarity ofdetail to fuzzy indistinctness.6) Contrast. Adjust the difference between light and dark,from stark contrast to more continuous gradations of gray.7) Scope. Vary from a bounded picture within a frame to apanoramic picture that continues around behind your head, sothat if you turn your head, you can see more of it.8) Movement, Change the picture from a still photo or slideto a movie.9) Speed. Adjust the speed of the movie from very slow tovery fast.10) Hue. Change the color balance. Increase the intensity ofreds and decrease the blues and greens, for example.11) Transparency. Make the image transparent, so that youcan see what's beneath the surface.12) Aspect Ratio. Make a framed picture tall and narrow . . •and then short and wide.13) Orientation. Tilt the top of that picture away from you. . . and then toward you.14) Foreground/background. Vary the difference or separationbetween foreground (what interests you most) and background(the context that just happens to be there). . . . Then try reversingit, so the background becomes interesting foreground.

Whenever you find an element that works really well,take a moment to figure out where and when you'd like to useit. For instance, pick a scary memory—even something from amovie. Take that picture and make it very large very suddenly. . . .That one's a thrill. If you have trouble getting going in themorning, try that instead of coffee!I asked you to try these one at a time so that you could findout how they work. Once you know how they work, you cancombine them to get even more intense changes. For example,pause and find an exquisitely pleasant sensual memory. First, makesure that it's a movie rather than just a still slide. Now take thatimage and pull it closer to you. As it comes closer, make itbrighter and more colorful at the same time that you slow themovie to about half speed. Since you have already learned some-thing about how your brain works, do whatever else works bestto intensify that experience for you. Go ahead. . . .Do you feel different? You can do that anytime ... and youwill have already paid for it. When you're just about to be reallymean to someone you love, you could stop and do this. And with"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"26 Using Your Brainthe look that's on your faces right now, who knows what youcould get into . . . .all kinds of fun trouble!What's amazing to me is that some people do it exactlybackwards. Think what your life would be like if you rememberedall your good experiences as dim, distant, fuzzy, black and whitesnapshots, but recalled all your bad experiences in vividly colorfulclose, panoramic, 3-D movies. That's a great way to get depressedand think that life isn't worth living. All of us have good and badexperiences; how we recall them is often what makes the differ-ence.I watched a woman at a party once. For three hours she hada great time—talking, dancing, showing off. Just as she wasgetting ready to leave, someone spilled coffee all down the fontof her dress. As she cleaned herself up, she said, \"Oh, now thewhole evening is ruined!\" Think about that: one bad moment wasenough to ruin three hours of happiness! I wanted to find outhow she did that, so I asked her about her dancing earlier. Shesaid she saw herself dancing with a coffee-stain on her dress! Shetook that coffee-stain and literally stained all her earlier memorieswith it.Many people do that. A man once said to me, \"I thought Iwas really happy for a week. But then I looked back and thoughtabout it, and realized that I wasn't really happy; it was all amistake.\" When he looked backwards, he recoded all his experi-ence and believed he had a rotten week. I wondered, \"If he canrevise his history that easily, why doesn't he do it the other way?Why not make all the unpleasant experiences nice?\"People often revise the past when they get divorced, or ifthey find out their spouse has had an affair. Suddenly all the goodtimes they enjoyed together over the years look different. \"It wasall a sham.\" \"I was just deluding myself.\"People who go on diets often do the same thing. \"Well, Ithought that diet was really working. I lost five pounds a weekfor three months. But then I gained a pound, so I knew it wasn'tworking.\" Some people have successfully lost weight many times,but it never dawned on them that they were succeeding. Onelittle indication that they're gaining weight and they decide, \"Thewhole thing was wrong.\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Running Your Own Brain 27One man came to therapy because he was \"afraid of marryingthe wrong woman.\" He'd been with this woman and he thoughthe loved her, and really wanted to marry her, to the point wherehe'd pay to work on it in therapy. The reason he knew that hecouldn't trust his ability to make this kind of decision is that hehad married the \"wrong woman\" once before. When I heard himsay that, I thought, \"I guess when he got home from the wedding,he must have discovered that this was a strange woman. I guesshe went to the wrong church or something.\" What on earth doesit mean that he married the \"wrong woman\"?When I asked him what it meant, I found that he had gottena divorce after five years of marriage. In his case, the first fourand a half years were really good. But then it got bad, so thewhole five years were a total mistake. \"I wasted five years of mylife, and I don't want to do that again. So I'm going to waste thenext five years trying to figure out if this is the right woman ornot.\" He was really concerned about that. It wasn't a joke to him.It was important. But it never dawned on him that the entirequestion was inappropriate.This man already knew that he and this woman made eachother happy in many ways. He didn't think about asking himselfhow he was going to make sure he got even happier as he stayedwith her, or how he was going to keep her happy. He had alreadydecided that it was necessary to find out if this was the \"rightwoman\" or not. He never questioned his ability to make thatdecision, but he didn't trust his ability to decide whether to marryher or not!Once I asked a man how he depressed himself and he said,Well, like if I go out to my car and find there's a flat tire.\"\"Well, that is an annoyance, but it doesn't seem like enoughto get depressed. How do you make that really depressing?\"\"I say to myself, 'It's always like this,' and then I see a lotPictures of all the other times that my car broke down.\"I know that for every time his car didn't work, there wereprobably three hundred times that it worked perfectly. But hedoesn't think of them at that moment. If I can get him to thinkof all those other times that his car worked fine, he won't bedepressed."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"28 Using Your BrainOnce a woman came to see me and told me that she wasdepressed. I asked her, \"How do you know that you are de-pressed?\" She looked at me and told me that her psychiatrist hadtold her. I said, \"Well, maybe he's wrong; maybe you're notdepressed; maybe this is happiness!\" She looked back at me,raised one eyebrow, and said, \"I don't think so.\" But she stillhadn't answered my question: \"How do you know that you'redepressed?\" \"If you were happy, how would you know that youwere happy?\" \"Have you ever been happy?\"I've discovered that most depressed people have actually hadas many happy experiences as most other people, it's just thatwhen they look back they don't think that it was really that happy.Instead of having rose-colored glasses, they have gray lenses.There was a marvelous lady up in Vancouver who actually had ablue hue over experiences that were unpleasant for her, but ex-periences that were pleasant had a pink hue. They were wellsorted out. If she took one memory and changed the hue, itchanged the memory totally. I can't tell you why that works, butthat is how she does it subjectively.The first time one of my clients said, \"I'm depressed,\" Ireplied, \"Hi, I'm Richard.\" He stopped and said, \"No.\"\"I'm not?\"\"Wait a minute. You're confused.\"\"I'm not confused. It's all perfectly clear to me.\"\"I've been depressed for sixteen years.\"\"That's amazing! You haven't slept in that long?\"The structure of what he's saying is this: \"I've coded myexperience such that I am living in the delusion that I have beenin the same state of consciousness for sixteen years.\" I know hehasn't been depressed for sixteen years. He's got to take time outfor lunch, and getting annoyed, and a few other things. Try tostay in the same state of consciousness for twenty minutes. Peoplespend a lot of money and time learning to meditate in order tostay in the same state for an hour or two. If he were depressedfor an hour straight, he wouldn't even be able to notice it, becausethe feeling would habituate and thereby become imperceptible. Ifyou do anything long enough, you won't even be able to detectit. That's what habituation does, even with physical sensation. So"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Running Your Own Brain 29I always ask myself, \"How is it possible for this guy to believethat he's been depressed all that time?\" You can cure people ofwhat they've got, and discover that they never had it, \"Sixteenyears of depression\" could be only 25 hours of actually beingdepressed.But if you take this man's statement, \"I've been depressedfor sixteen years,\" at face value, you're accepting the presuppo-sition that he's been in one state of consciousness for that long.And if you accept the goal that you're going to go after makinghim happy, you'll be attempting to permanantly put him in anotherstate of consciousness. You may in fact be able to get him tobelieve that he's happy all the time. You can teach him to recodeeverything in the past as happiness. No matter how miserable heis at the moment, he'll always appreciate that he's happy all thetime. He'll be no better off, moment to moment—only when helooks into the past. You've just given him a new delusion toreplace the one he walked in with.A lot of people are depressed because they have good reasonto be. A lot of people have dull, meaningless lives, and they'reunhappy. Talking to a therapist won't change that, unless it resultsin the person living differently. If someone will spend $75 to seea psychiatrist, instead of spending it on a party, that's not mentalillness, that's stupidity! If you don't do anything, then of courseyou're going to be bored and depressed. Catatonia is an extremecase of that.When someone tells me she's depressed, I do the same thingI always do: I want to find out how to do it. I figure if I can gothrough it methodically step by step, and find out how she doesit well enough that I can do it, then I can usually tell her somethingabout how to do it differently, or else find somebody else who isnot depressed and find out now that person does that.Some people have an internal voice that sounds slow anddepressed and makes long lists of their failures. You can talkyourself into very depressed states that way. It would be likehaving some of my college professors inside your head. No wonderthose people are depressed. Sometimes the internal voice is solow that the person isn't consciously aware of it until you ask her.Because the voice is unconscious, she'll respond to it even more"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"30 Using Your Brainpowerfully than if it were conscious—it will have a stronger hyp-notic impact.Any of you who have done therapy for a long time during aday may have noticed that there are times when you mentallydrift away while you are seeing clients. Those are called trancestates. If your client is talking about bad feelings and beingdepressed, you'll begin to respond to those suggestions, like any-body does in a trance. If you have \"up\" and cheerful clients, thatcan work for you. But if you have clients who are depressed, youcan go home at the end of the day feeling terrible.If you have a client who depresses herself with one of thesevoices, try increasing the volume of that voice until she can hearit clearly, so it won't have the hypnotic impact. Then change thetonality until it's a very cheerful voice. She'll feel a lot better,even if that cheerful voice is still reciting a list of failures.Many people depress themselves with pictures, and there area lot of variations. You can make collages of all the times thingswent wrong in the past, or you can make up thousands of picturesof how things could go wrong in the future. You can look ateverything in the real world and superimpose an image of whatit will look like in a hundred years. Have you heard the saying,\"You begin dying the moment you're born.\" That's a great one.Every time something nice happens, you can say to yourself,\"This won't last,\" or \"It's not real,\" or \"He doesn't really meanit.\" There are many ways to do it. The question is always, \"Howdoes this person do it?\" A detailed answer to that question willtell you everything you need to know in order to teach him howto do something else instead. The only reason that he doesn't dosomething more sensible is that it's all he knows how to do. Sincehe's done it for years, it's \"normal\"—unquestioned and unnoticed.One of the wildest propensities in our culture is to act as ifthings are normal under any circumstances. The most elegantdemonstration of that is New York City, as far as I'm concerned.If you walk down Broadway, no one's looking around and mut-tering \"Good Lord!\"The next best demonstration is downtown Santa Cruz. Peopleare doing things, right out on the street, that would put anymental hospital to shame. Yet there are men in business suits"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Running Your Own Brain 31walking down the street talking to each other as if everything iscompletely normal.I came from a \"normal\" environment, too. In my neighbor-hood, when I was nine years old and had nothing to do, I'd hangaround with the guys. Somebody would say, \"Hey, why don't wego out and steal a car?\" \"Let's go down and rob a liquor store,and murder someone.\"I thought the way to succeed in life was to go live with therich people. I thought if I hung around them, it would rub off.So I went to a place called Los Altos, where people have money.Los Altos Junior College at that time had sterling silver in thecafeteria, and real leather chairs in the student center. The parkinglot looked like Detroit's current year showroom. Of course whenI went there, I had to act like all that was normal, too. \"Ho hum,everything's cool.\"I got a job working with a machine that you communicatewith, called a computer, and started as an information sciencestudent. They didn't have the department yet, because someonehad stalled the funding for a couple of years. Since I was in schooland there was no major there for me, I was lost in an existentialcrisis. \"What will I do? I'll study psychology.\" About that time Igot involved in editing a book about Gestalt Therapy, so I wassent to a Gestalt Therapy group to see what it was all about. Thiswas my first experience of group psychotherapy. Everybody wascrazy where I grew up, and everybody was crazy where I worked,but I expected people who went to therapists to be really crazy.The first thing I saw there was somebody sitting and talkingto an empty chair. I thought, \"Oohhh! I was right. They arecrazy.\" And then there was this other nut telling him what to sayto the empty chair! Then I got worried, because everybody elsein the room was looking at the empty chair, too, as if it wereanswering! The therapist asked, \"And what does he say?\" So Ilooked at the chair, too. Later I was told that it was a room fullof psychotherapists, so it was OK.Then the therapist said, \"Are you aware of what your handis doing?\" When the guy said \"No,\" I cracked up. \"Are you awareof it now?\" \"Yes.\" \"What is it doing? Exaggerate that movement.\"Strange, right? Then the therapist says \"Put words to it.\" \"I want"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"32 Using Your Brainto kill, kill.\" This guy turned out to be a neurosurgeon! Thetherapist said \"Now, look at that chair, and tell me who you see.\"I looked, and there was still nobody there! But the guy lookedover there and snarled, \"My brother!\"\"Tell him you're angry.\"\"I'm angry!\"\"Say it louder.\"\"I'm angry]\"\"About what?\"And then he starts telling this empty chair all these thingsthat he's angry about, and then he attacks it. He smashes thechair to bits, and then apologizes, and works it out with the chair,and then he feels better. Then everyone in the group says nicethings to him and hugs him.Since I had been around scientists and murderers, I could actlike everything was normal almost anywhere, but I was havingtrouble. Afterwards I asked the other people, \"Was his brotherreally there?\"\"Some of them said, \"Of course he was.\"\"Where did you see him?'\"In my mind's eye.\"You can do just about anything. If you act as if it's normal,other people will too. Think about it. You can say \"This is grouppsychotherapy,\" put chairs around in a circle, and say \"This chairis the 'hot seat.' \" Then if you say \"Who wants to work?\" every-body will start to get nervous while they wait. Finally someonewho gets motivated when stress builds up to a certain point can'ttake it anymore: \"I want to work!\" So you say, \"That chair's nota good enough place to do it. You come and sit in this specialchair.\" Then you put an empty chair across from him. Often you'dstart in the following way:\"Now, tell me what you're aware of.\"\"My heart is pounding.\"\"Close your eyes, and tell me what you're aware of.\"\"People are watching me.\"Think about that for a minute. When his eyes are open, heknows what's going on inside; when his eyes are shut, he knows"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Running Your Own Brain 33what's going on outside! For those of you who aren't familiar withGestalt Therapy, this is a very common phenomenon.There is a time and a place where people believed that talkingto an empty chair was meaningful, and in fact it was. It canaccomplish certain useful things. It was also very dangerous inways they didn't understand, and many people still don't. Peoplelearn repeated sequences of behavior, and not necessarily thecontent. The sequence you learn in Gestalt Therapy is the follow-ing: When you feel sad or frustrated, you hallucinate old friendsand relatives, become angry and violent, and then you feel betterand other people are nice to you.Take that sequence and translate it into the real world withoutthe content. What does the person learn? When he's not feelinggood, hallucinate, get angry and violent, and then feel good aboutit. How's that for a model for human relationships? Is that howyou want to relate to your wife and children? But why take it outon a loved one? When you're furious, just go out and find astranger. Walk up to him, hallucinate a dead relative, beat thesnot out of him, and feel better. Some people actually do that,even without the benefit of Gestalt Therapy, but we don't usuallythink of that pattern of behavior as a cure. When people gothrough therapy, or any other repeated experience, they learnwhatever's done really quickly, and they learn the pattern andsequence of what's done more that the content. Since most ther-apists focus on content, they usually won't even notice the se-quence they're teaching.Some people will look you straight in the eye and tell youthe reason they are the way they are is because of something thathappened long ago in their childhood. If that's true, they arereally stuck, because of course then nothing can be done aboutit; you can't go have your childhood again.However, the same people believe that you can pretend youare having your childhood again, and that you can go back andchange it. The fact that you don't like what happened means thatthe event is \"unfinished,\" so you can go back and \"finish\" it in away that you like better. That's a great reframe, and it's a veryuseful one."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"34 Using Your BrainI think everything is unfinished in this sense: you can onlymaintain any memory, belief, understanding, or other mentalprocess from one day to the next if you continue to do it. There-fore, it's still going on. If you have some understanding of theprocesses that continue to maintain it, you can change it wheneveryou don't like it.It's actually quite easy to modify past experiences. The nextthing I'd like to teach you is what I call \"briefest therapy.\" Onenice thing about it is that it's also secret therapy, so you can alltry it now.Think of an unpleasant embarrassment or disappointment,and take a good look at that movie to see if it still makes youfeel bad now. If it doesn't, pick another one. . . .Next, start that movie again, and as soon as it begins, putsome nice loud circus music behind it. Listen to the circus musicright through to the end of the movie. . . .Now watch that original movie again. . . . Does that makeyou feel better? For most of you it will change a tragedy into acomedy, and lighten your feelings about it. If you have a memorythat makes you annoyed and angry, put circus music with it. Ifyou run it by with circus music, the next time it comes back itwill automatically have the circus music with it, and it won't feelthe same. For a few of you, circus music may be an inappropriatechoice for that particular memory. If you didn't notice any change,or if your feelings changed in an unsatisfactory way, see if youcan think of some other music or sounds that you think mightimpact that memory, and then try playing that music with yourmemory. You could try a thousand soap-opera violins, or operamusic, the 1812 Overture, \"Hernando's Hideaway,\" or whatever,and find out what happens. If you start experimenting, you canfind lots of ways to change your experience.Pick another bad memory. Run the movie however you usu-ally do, to find out if it bothers you now- . . .Now run that same memory backwards, from the end backto the beginning, just as if you were rewinding the film, and doit very quickly, in a few seconds. . . .Now run the movie forward again. . . ."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Running Your Own Brain 35Do you feel the same about that memory after running itbackwards?

I'mgoing to go back and apologize to that person.Man: I really heard the other person for the first time, andwhat she said actually made sense.Man: As I listened to myself I kept thinking, \"Can't you sayit some other way, so that you can get your point across?\"37"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"38 Using Your BrainHow many of you are as certain about being right as youwere before trying this different point of view? . . . About threeout of 60. So much for your chances of being right when you'recertain you are—about 5%.People have been talking about \"points of view\" for centuries.However, they've always thought of it as being metaphorical,rather than literal. They didn't know how to give someone specificinstructions to change his point of view. What you just did is onlyone possibility out of thousands. You can literally view somethingfrom any point in space. You can view that same argument fromthe side as a neutral observer, so that you can see yourself andthat other person equally well. You can view it from somewhereon the ceiling to get \"above it all,\" or from a point on the floorfor a \"worm's eye\" view. You can even take the point of view ofa very small child, or of a very old person. That's getting a littlemore metaphorical, and less specific, but if it changes your ex-perience in a useful way, you can't argue with it.When something bad happens, some people say, \"Well, in ahundred years, who'll know the difference?\" For some of you,hearing this doesn't have an impact. You may just think, \"Hedoesn't understand.\" But when some people say it or hear it, itactually changes their experience and helps them cope with prob-lems. So of course I asked some of them what they did insidetheir minds as they said that sentence. One guy looked down atthe solar system from a point out in space, watching the planetsspin around in their orbits. From that point of view, he couldbarely see himself and his problems as a tiny speck on the surfaceof the earth.

Not only that; they'reeven announcing what they're doing. If you take the time to askthem a few questions, you can discover all sorts of things you cando with your brain.There is another fascinating phrase that has always stuck inmy mind. When you're going through something unpleasant, peo-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Points of View 39pie will often say, \"Later, when you look back at this, you'll beable to laugh.\" There must be something that you do in yourhead in the meantime that makes an unpleasant experience funnylater. How many people in here have something you can lookback on and laugh at? ... And do you all have a memory thatyou can't laugh at yet? . . . I want you to compare those twomemories to find out how they're different. Do you see yourselfin one, and not in the other? Is one a slide and one a movie? Isthere a difference in color, size, brightness, or location? Find outwhat's different, and then try changing that unpleasant picture tomake it like the one that you can already laugh at. If the onethat you can laugh at is far away, make the other one far awaytoo. If you see yourself in the one you laugh at, see yourself inthe experience that is still unpleasant. My philosophy is: Why waitto feel better? Why not \"look back and laugh\" while you're goingthrough it in the first place? If you go through something un-pleasant, you would think that once is more than enough. But ohno, your brain doesn't think that. It says \"Oh, you fouled up. I'lltorture you for three or four years. Then maybe I'll let you laugh.\"Man: I see myself in the memory I can laugh about; I'm anobserver. But I feel stuck in the memory I still feel bad about,just like it's happening again.That's a common response. Is that true for many of the restof you? Being able to observe yourself gives you a chance to \"re-view\" an event \"from a different perspective\" and see it in a newway, as if it's happening to someone else. The best kind of humorinvolves looking at yourself in a new way. The only thing thatprevents you from doing that with an event right away is notrealizing that you can do it. When you get good at it, you caneven do it while the event is actually happening.Woman: What I do is different, but it works really well. Ifocus in like a microscope until all I can see is a small part ofthe event magnified, filling the whole screen. In this case all Icould see was these enormous lips pulsating and jiggling andflopping as he talked. It was so grotesque I cracked up.That's certainly a different point of view. And it's also some-thing that you could easily try out when that bad experience isactually happening the first time."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"40 Using Your BrainWoman: I've done that, I'll be all stuck in some horriblesituation and then I'll focus in on something and then laugh athow weird it is.Now I want you all to think of two memories from your past:one pleasant and one unpleasant. Take a moment or two tore-experience those two memories in whatever way you naturallydo. ...Next, I want you to notice whether you were associated ordissociated in each of those memories.Associated means going back and reliving the experience,seeing it from your own eyes. You see exactly what you saw whenyou were actually there. You may see your hands in front of you,but you can't see your face unless you're looking in a mirror.Dissociated means looking at the memory image from anypoint of view other than from your own eyes. You might see itas if you were looking down from an airplane, or you might seeit as if you were someone else watching a movie of yourself inthat situation, etc.Now go back to each of those two memories, in turn, andfind out whether you are associated or dissociated in eachone. . . .Whichever way you recalled those two memories naturally, Iwant you to go back and try experiencing them the other way, inorder to discover how this changes your experience.

Is there anyonehere who didn't notice a difference?Man: I don't notice much difference.OK. Try the following. Feel yourself sitting on a park benchat a carnival and see yourself in the front seat of a roller coaster.See your hair blowing in the wind as the roller coaster startsdown that first big slope. . . .Now compare that with what you would experience if youwere actually sitting in the front seat, holding onto the front of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Points of View 41the roller coaster, high in the air, actually looking down thatslope. . . .Are those two different?

It's cheaper than coffee, too, for becoming alert.Woman: In one of my memories it seems like I'm both in itand out of it.OK, There are two possibilities. One is that you are switchingback and forth quickly. If that's the case, just notice how it'sdifferent as you switch. You might have to slow down the switch-ing a little in order to do that well.The other possibility is that you were dissociated in theoriginal experience. For instance, being self-critical usually pre-supposes a point of view other than your own. It's as if you'reoutside of yourself, observing and being critical of yourself. Ifthat's the case, when you recall the experience and \"see what yousaw at the time\" you'll also be dissociated. Does either of thosedescriptions fit your experience?Woman: They both do. At the time I was self-critical, and Ithink I was flipping back and forth between observing myself andfeeling criticized.There is even a third possibility, but it's pretty rare. Somepeople create a dissociated picture of themselves while they areassociated in the original experience. One guy had a full-lengthmirror that he carried around with him all the time. So if hewalked into a room, he could simultaneously see himself walkinginto the room in his mirror. Another guy had a little TV. monitorhe'd put on a shelf or a wall nearby, so he could always see howhe looked to other people.When you recall a memory associated, you re-experience theoriginal feeling response that you had at the time. When yourecall a memory dissociated, you can see yourself having thoseoriginal feelings in the picture, but without feeling them in yourbody.You may, however, have a new feeling about the event asYou watch yourself in it. This is what happens when Virginia Satirasks a question like, \"How do you feel about feeling angry?\" Tryit. Recall a time when you were angry, and then ask that question,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"42 Using Your Brain\"How do I feel about feeling angry?\" In order to answer thatquestion you have to pop out of the picture, and have a newfeeling about the event as an observer rather than as a participant.It's a very effective way to change your response.The ideal situation is to recall all your pleasant memoriesassociated, so that you can easily enjoy all the positive feelingsthat go with them. When you are dissociated from your unpleasantmemories, you still have all the visual information about whatyou may need to avoid or deal with in the future, but withoutthe unpleasant feeling response. Why feel bad again? Wasn't itenough to feel bad once?Many people do the reverse: they associate with, and im-mediately feel, all the unpleasantness that ever occurred to them,but their pleasant experiences are only dim, distant, dissociatedimages. And of course there are two other possibilities. Somepeople tend to always dissociate. These are the scientist/engineertypes who are often described as \"objective,\" \"detached,\" or \"dis-tant.\" You can teach them how to associate when they want to,and regain some feeling connection with their experience. Youcan probably think of some times when this would be a realadvantage for them. Making love is one of the things that's a lotmore enjoyable if you're in your body feeling all those sensations,rather than watching yourself from the outside.Others tend to always associate: they immediately have allthe feelings of past experiences, good or bad. These are the peoplewho are often described as \"theatrical,\" \"responsive,\" or \"impul-sive.\" Many of the problems they have can be cured by teachingthem to dissociate at appropriate times. Dissociation can be usedfor pain control, for example. If you watch yourself have pain,you're not in your body to feel it.You can do yourself a real favor by taking a little time torun through several of your unpleasant memories dissociated. Findout how far away you need to move the pictures so that you canstill see them clearly enough to learn from them, while you watchcomfortably. Then run through a series of pleasant experiences,taking time to associate with each one, and fully enjoy them.What you are teaching your brain to do is to associate with pleasantmemories, and dissociate from unpleasant ones. Pretty soon your"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Points of View 43brain will get the idea, and do the same thing automatically withall your other memories.Teaching someone how, and when, to associate or dissociateis one of the most profound and pervasive ways to change thequality of a person's experience, and the behavior that resultsfrom it. Dissociation is particularly useful for intensely unpleasantmemories.Does anybody in here have a phobia? I love phobias, butthey're so easy to fix that we're running out of them. Look atthat. The only people in here with phobias have phobias of raisingtheir hands in an audience.Joan: I have one.Do you have a real, flaming phobia?Joan: Well it's pretty bad. (She starts breathing rapidly andshaking.)I can see that.Joan: Do you want to know what it's about?No, I don't. I'm a mathematician. I work purely with process.I can't know your inside experience anyway, so why talk aboutit? You don't have to talk about your inside experience to changeit. In fact, if you talk about it, your therapist may end up beinga professional companion. You know what you're phobic of. Is itsomething you see, or hear, or feel?Joan: It's something I see.OK. I'm going to ask you to do a few things that you cando in your mind really quickly, so that your phobia won't botheryou at all, ever again. I'll give you the directions one part at atime, and then you go inside and do it.

You know, I'd never really seen the inside ofan elevator before. This morning I couldn't even step into it,because I was too terrified, but just now I rode up and downseveral times.That's a typical report. I almost got nervous one time, though.I was teaching in the Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta, which has a 70-story outdoor elevator. So I just had to find an elevator phobic.I cured this lady and sent her out of the seminar to test it. Afterabout a half an hour I started thinking, \"Oh oh, maybe she gotup there and can't get down.\" When she came rolling in aboutfifteen minutes later, I asked her where she'd been. \"Oh I wasjust riding up and down. It was really fun.\"Once an accountant came to me with a phobia of publicspeaking that he'd been trying to get rid of for sixteen years. Oneof the first things he told me was that he had a total investmentof over $70,000 in trying to cure his phobia. I asked him how heknew this, and he pulled out his therapy briefcase with all thecancelled checks in it. I said, \"What about your time?\" His eyeswidened and he said, \"I didn't figure that in!\" He got paid aboutthe same rate as a psychiatrist, so he had actually invested about$140,000 trying to change something that took me ten minutes tochange.If you can be terrified of an elevator, and then learn torespond differently, it seems like you should be able to changeany pattern of behavior, because terror's a pretty strong behavior.Fear is an interesting thing. People move away from it. If you tellsomeone to look at something she's terrified of, she can't look atit. However, if you tell her to see herself looking at it, she's stilllooking at it, but for some reason she can do it that way. It's thesame as the difference between sitting in the front seat of a rollercoaster and sitting on a bench seeing yourself in a roller coaster.That is enough for people to be able to change their responses.You can use the same procedure with victims of rape, child abuse,and war experiences: \"post-traumatic stress syndrome.\"Years ago it took me an hour to work with a phobia.

Most people have a hard time believing that we can curea phobia that fast. That's really funny, because I can't do it slowly.I can cure a phobia in two minutes, but I can't do it in a month,because the brain doesn't work that way. The brain learns byhaving patterns go by rapidly. Imagine if I gave you one frameof a movie every day for five years. Would you get the plot? Ofcourse not. You only get the meaning of the movie if all thosepictures go by really fast. Trying to change slowly is like havinga conversation one word a day.Man: How about practice, then? When you create a changeonce, like with Joan, does she have to practice?No. She's already changed, and she won't have to practice,or think about it consciously. If change work is hard, or takesmuch practice, then you're going about it in the wrong way, andyou need to change what you're doing. When you find a pathwithout resistance, you're combining resources, and doing it onceis plenty. When Joan went into the elevator during the break, shedidn't have to try not to be terrified. She was already changed,and that new response will last as well as the original terror.One of the nice things about someone with a phobia is thatshe's already proved that she's a rapid learner. Phobics are peoplewho can learn something utterly ridiculous very quickly. Mostpeople tend to look at a phobia as a problem, rather than as anachievement. They never stop to think, \"If she can learn to dothat, then she should be able to learn to do anything.\"It always amazed me that someone could learn to be terrifiedso consistently and dependably. Years ago I thought, \"That's thekind of change I want to be able to make,\" That led me towonder, \"How could I give someone a phobia?\" I figured that ifI couldn't give someone a phobia, I couldn't be really methodicalabout taking it away.If you accept the idea that phobias can only be bad, thatpossibility would never occur to you. You can make pleasantresponses just as strong and dependable as phobias. There arethings that people see and light up with happiness every singletime—newborns, or very small children will do it for nearly everyone.

Couples often do this nat-urally when they get divorced. You can look at that person youonce loved passionately, and have no feelings about her whatso-ever.

But if you dissociate from allthe good times you had with that person, you'll be throwing awaya very nourishing set of experiences. Even if you can't stand tobe with her now, because you've changed or she's changed, youmay as well enjoy your pleasant memories.Some people go on to dissociate from all the pleasant expe-riences they're having now, \"so they won't be hurt again later.\"If you do that, you won't be able to enjoy your own life evenwhen it's nice. It will always be like watching someone else havingfun, but you never get to play.

I'm scaredsilly of dogs.There are always other ways to do things; it's a matter of\"Do we know about them yet?\" \"Are they as dependable?\" \"Howlong do they take?\" \"What else will they affect?\" and so on.Try this: go back and recall a memory of something exquis-itely pleasurable, exciting, and humorous from your past, and seewhat you saw at the time that it occurred. Can you find a memorylike that? . . . (She starts to smile.) That's good. Turn the bright-ness up a little bit, . . . (She smiles more.) That's fine. Now keepthat picture and have a dog come right through the middle ofthat picture and then become a part of that picture. As it doesthat, I want you to make the picture a little bit brighter. . . .Now imagine being in the same room with a dog, to see ifyou're still phobic. . . .Woman: I feel fine when I think of it now.That procedure is a variation of another method I'll teachyou later. It's not quite as dependable as dissociation for verystrong phobias, but it will usually work. I've done a lot of phobias,so I'm bored with them, and I usually just do the fastest and mostdependable thing I know. Now that you know it, you can do it,too. But if you really want to understand how brains work, thenext time you have a phobic client, take a little longer. Ask a lotof questions to find out how this particular phobia works. Forinstance, sometimes a phobic person will make the picture of thedog, or whatever it is, very large, or bright, or colorful, or run amovie very slowly, or over and over again. Then you can trychanging different things to find out how you can change thisparticular person's experience.

She brought me a bunch of people who wereshy. I always thought shy people were shy because they thoughtabout unpleasant things that would happen—like rejection, orbeing laughed at. I started asking these people my usual questions,\"How do you know when to be shy? You're not shy all the time.\"Like all the things people do, shyness requires some process. It'sno easy task. One man said, \"I know it's time to be shy when Iknow that I'm going to meet somebody.\" \"Well, what makes youshy?\" \"I don't think they'll like me.\" That statement is verydifferent from \"I think they won't like me.\" He literally said \"Idon't\"—I do engage in the activity of not—\"think they'll like me.\"He thinks anything else but that the person will like him. Therewere some people in the next room, so I said to him, \"I wantyou to think that they'll like you.\" \"OK.\" \"Are you shy aboutmeeting them?\" \"No.\" That seems a little too easy, but basically,what works always turns out to be easy.Unfortunately in psychotherapy there isn't much incentive tofind out what works quickly and easily. In most businesses, peopleget paid by succeeding at something. But in psychotherapy youget paid by the hour, whether anything is accomplished or not. Ifa therapist is incompetent, he gets paid more than someone whocan achieve change quickly. Many therapists even have a ruleagainst being effective. They think that influencing anyone directlyis manipulative, and that manipulation is bad. It's as if they said,\"You're paying me to influence you. But I'm not going to do itbecause it's not the right thing to do,\" When I saw clients, Ialways charged by the change, rather than by the hour; I only gotpaid when I got results. That seemed like more of a challenge.The reasons that therapists use to justify their failures arereally outrageous. Often they'll say, \"He wasn't ready to change.\"That's a \"jive excuse\" if there ever was one. If he's \"not ready,\"how can anyone justify seeing him week after week and charginghim money? Tell him to go home, and to come back when he'sready\"! I always figured if somebody \"wasn't ready to change,\"then it was my job to make him ready."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"54 Using Your BrainWhat if you took your car to a mechanic, and he worked onit for a couple of weeks, but it still didn't work. If he told you,\"The car wasn't ready to change,\" you wouldn't buy that excusewould you? But therapists get away with it day after day.The other standard excuse is that the client is \"resistant.\"Imagine that your mechanic told you that your car was \"resistant.\"\"Your car just wasn't mature enough to accept the valve job.Bring it in again next week, and we'll try again.\" You wouldn'taccept that excuse for a minute. Obviously the mechanic eitherdoesn't know what he's doing, or the changes he's trying to makeare irrelevant to the problem, or he's using the wrong tools. Thesame is true of therapeutic or educational change. Effective ther-apists and teachers can make people \"ready to change,\" and whenthey're doing the right thing, there won't be any resistance.Unfortunately, most humans have a perverse tendency. Ifthey're doing something and it doesn't work, they'll usually do itlouder, harder, longer, or more often. When a child doesn'tunderstand, a parent will usually shout the exact same sentence,rather than try a new set of words. And when punishment doesn'tchange someone's behavior, the usual conclusion is that it wasn'tenough, so we have to do it more.I always thought that if something wasn't working, that mightbe an indication that it was time to do something else! If youknow that something doesn't work, then anything else has a betterchance of working than more of the same thing.Non-professionals also have interesting excuses. I've beencollecting them. People used to say, \"I lost control over myself,\"or \"I don't know what came over me.\" Probably a purple cloudor an old blanket did it, I guess. In the 60's people went toencounter groups and learned to say, \"I can't help it; it's just theway I feel.\" If somebody says, \"I just felt I had to throw a handgrenade into the room,\" that's not acceptable. But if someonesays, \"I just can't accept what you're saying; I have to yell at youand make you feel bad; it's just the way I feel,\" people will acceptit.The word \"just\" is a fascinating word; it's one of the waysto be unjust to other people. \"Just\" is a handy way to disqualifyeverything but what you're talking about. If someone's feeling"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Going Wrong 55bad, and you say something nice to him, he'll often say, \"You'rejust trying to cheer me up\"—as if cheering someone up is a badthing! It might be true that you're trying to cheer him up, but\"just\" makes it the only thing that's true. The word \"just\" dis-counts everything else about the situation.The favorite excuse these days is, \"I wasn't myself.\" You canget out of anything with that one. It's like multiple personality orthe insanity defense. \"I wasn't myself ... I must have been her!\"All these excuses are ways of justifying and continuing un-happiness, instead of trying out something else that might makelife more enjoyable and interesting for you—and for other peopletoo.Now I think it's time for a demonstration.

Whensomeone's offended me in some way, and I want them to treatme differently, I confront them.You expect that to be a negative experience?Jo: Yes. And it isn't. It usually turns out to be much morepositive. I may start out feeling uncomfortable, but I feel morecomfortable as I get into it.Does that make it useful?Jo: It makes it a useful learning for me to actually confrontthem.

Not as much as I used to.I'm asking you to do it now.Jo: Uhuh, a little bit.You have to stop and take time to really do it. Think ofsomeone whom it would be very hard to confront about some-thing.

And I'm not saying confronting is not of value, either.I'm just asking, \"How do you know when to do it?\" and \"Howdoes this process work?\" Would you go out and kill someone fordamaging your integrity?Jo: No.There are a lot of people who would. Maybe it would bebetter if we taught them to do whatever you do. But I don't evenknow yet what it means for you to \"confront\" someone.

I'm not really picking onyou. You're just a good focal point to get other people uncon-sciously. Did it ever occur to you to make people in a restaurantfeel so good, before they served you, that they'd have no alter-native but to give you good service . . . ?Jo: I don't understand. . . . Somehow I lost that somewhere.It always amazes me that people go to a restaurant to havea human being wait on them, and then don't treat him like one.Having been a waiter, I can tell you that most of the people whogo to a restaurant treat you very strangely. There are a few peoplewho come in and make you feel good, and that compels you tospend more time near them—regardless of whether they tip moreor less. There is something about being around somebody who isnice to you that's more attractive than being around somebodywho isn't nice—or who isn't even acknowledging that you exist.Have any of you pretended with a child that he doesn't exist?Most kids will freak. Imagine being a waiter and having a roomfull of people doing that to you. Then someone treats you likeyou're not a machine, but a human being, and makes you feelgood. Who would you hang around with more? One way to getgood service in a restaurant is to treat the waiter wdl first, so asto make him want to treat you well.The other alternative is to coerce him and make him feel badenough to give you what you wanted, and expected to get without"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Going Wrong 59having to go through all the trouble of being nasty about it. Ifyou do that, not only do you have to pay your bill, but you haveto taint your own experience as well. Most people never thinkabout that. Why should they go to a restaurant and be nice to awaiter? They should get good service automatically.People often think of marriage in that way, too. \"You shouldhave known that.\" \"I shouldn't have to tell him; he should do itautomatically.\" And if he doesn't, that means it's time to getangry, intense, and force him to do it. And even when you win,what do you win? High self-esteem?Man: An opportunity for your spouse to get even.I've had a lot of people do that to me. I decided to take itup, and deliberately start getting even ahead of time! How manypeople have to get \"even\" when you do something nice to them?I'm not asking about whether you are nasty or nice; that's Santa'sjob. The question I'm asking you is, \"Have you ever consideredbeing considerate ahead of time?\"Woman: Yes, my strategy for a restaurant is to ask the wait-ress what she suggests is the best on the menu, and she'll pickout a selection. I look at that and suggest that she could makesure that it's fine, and the steak's not too small. I also ask hername, and talk to her by name.So, yes, you've considered being nice, and actually attemptedit. Like everything else in the world, it doesn't always work. Buthow many of you never even considered it when things weren'tgoing well, or before things weren't going well? Why would awaiter go all the way down to a restaurant every night to givesomeone bad service, when they make their living by tips? Didyou ever stop and consider that, Jo?Jo: Yes, I did.And you confronted them?Jo: Well, I considered it, but I wasn't able to be as pleasantas I thought I should be. I wasn't able to be very agreeable whenI was really disgusted. I wasn't able to change how I acted.\"She should have done it first anyway,\" right? Then youwouldn't have had to be disgusted, and had difficulty changingthat."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"60 Using Your BrainJo: Well, that's the way it seemed then. It seems very differentnow.Now let's back up to the beginning. When we first startedtalking, Jo wanted to be more competent at being unpleasant. Ifyou really heard what she was saying, it was, \"I want to be ableto stand up for myself and grumble and gripe more thoroughly.\"Nobody in the room heard her say that when she first talked. Ifthey had heard it, they would have tried to teach her how to bemore nasty. Think what an \"assertiveness\" trainer would havedone with that! I have a new name for assertiveness training. Icall it \"loneliness preparation.\"In contrast, I ask questions to learn how to have someoneelse's limitations. If I can learn how it works, then I can changeit any way I want, and it will still work, but differently. You can'tmake a valid judgement about a process unless you know what itis, and you can't realty know what it is unless you try it.So I thought, \"OK, Jo can't grumble and gripe. Where is itthat she can't, because I want to learn how to not do it there?\"I started asking her questions: \"When do you do it?\" \"What isits purpose?\" \"Who do you do it with?\" My questions go back-wards in time. Starting with the problem, I backed up the processshe goes through. When I backed her up far enough, she got tothe place before she grumbled and griped, and before she evenfelt any inclination to do it. That is the place where she can goaround it. If she takes the next step, the \"problem\" starts hap-pening. But if she steps over to the side, she can go somewhereelse that she likes better.Jo goes into a restaurant, sits down, gets bad service, feelshorrible, confronts the waitress, gets good service later and stillfeels bad. I asked, \"Did it ever occur to you when you go into arestaurant and discover who your waitress is, to make her feelgood?\" She said, \"I can't do that after I feel bad,\" and she'sprobably right. OK, why not do it right away all the time when-ever you go into a restaurant, so you never get a chance to feetbad? That question directs her attention to an earlier time, whenit's easy to do something different, and it also gives her somethingvery specific to do differently.Here's one you've all done. You come home feeling realty"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Going Wrong 61good. As you walk in the front door you see the living room isa mess, or someone forgot to take out the garbage, or you seethat something else equally absolutely essential to your happinessis awry. You get angry inside, and frustrated; you suppress it andtry to not feel angry and frustrated, but it doesn't work. So yougo into therapy and you say, \"I don't want to yell at my wife.\"\"Why do you yell at your wife?\" \"Because I get frustrated andangry.\" Most clinicians will say, \"Let it all out; express yourself;yell and scream at your wife.\" And to the wife they'll say, \"Isn'tit all right if he yells and screams at you? Can't you let him behimself?\" You do your thing, and he'll do his ... separately.That's nuts,What most clinicians don't think about is that when he walksin the door and sees that mess, he first manages to get to thestate where he's angry and frustrated, and then he tries to stophimself from getting angry and frustrated. The other thing theyforget is what he's frying to accomplish by stopping himself fromyelling at her in the first place: he's trying to get things to bepleasant. Well, why not go for it directly? Why not have the frontdoor send him off into such pleasant thoughts about what he cando with his wife that he goes through the living room too fast tocare about noticing anything else!Whenever I say, \"How about doing something before youfeel so bad?\" the client always looks stunned. It doesn't occur tohim to back up. He always thinks that the only way he can makehimself happy is to do what he wants exactly at the moment thathe wants it. Is that the only way? It must be. The universe doesn'tgo backwards. Time won't go backwards. Light won't go back-wards. But your mind can go backwards.Typically clients will either not understand what I said at all,or will say, \"I can't just do that!\" It sounds too easy. So I foundout I had to make them do it. They couldn't back up themselves,because they couldn't stop going where they were going. So Ilearned to ask them questions that would force them to go back-wards, Often they fight me tooth and nail. They'll try to answerone question, and I insist that they answer another one to backthem up another step.When I get to the right point with a client, I ask a question"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"62 Using Your Brainthat moves sideways and forward, and he goes forward again inthe new direction. After that he can't stop going in the newdirection. He's as stuck that way as the other, but he doesn't carebecause he likes being stuck that way. It works just like a spring:you compress it, and when you pull the lever over and release it,it flics forward again.As soon as someone finds one of those places, he says, \"Oh,I've changed. Let's go on now.\" It's so nonchalant. \"How do youknow you've changed?\" \"I don't know. It doesn't matter. It'sdifferent now.\" But Jo is still propelling forward on the new path.I've been testing her repeatedly. And she can't get back there tothe other one now because it's too late.I do this simply by presupposing that what is getting in herway is worth having, and all I need to do is find out where touse it. So, I take the behavior Jo is uncomfortable about—con-fronting—and take that back to before she even thinks aboutconfronting. The same forces that used to drive her to confrontand be uncomfortable about it will now compel her into anotherbehavior.What we have explored here with Jo is a common pattern inmarriage. You want something from him, but he doesn't give itto you. So you feel bad. Then you tell him how bad you feel,hoping he'll be concerned enough to give it to you.There are times when you don't get what you want fromsomeone else. But when you don't get what you want, feeling badis extra! Did you ever think of that? First you don't get what youwant, and then you have to feel bad for a long time because youdidn't get it. And then you have to feel bad to try to get it again.If you feel good, then you can just go back to that person andsay, \"Hey, you. Do you want to do this for me?\" If you do thatwith a cheerful tone of voice, you're much more likely to get it,and without any future repercussions.The greatest error of all is in thinking that the only way foryou to feel good in certain situations is for someone else to behavein a certain way. \"You must behave the way I want you to, so Ican feel good, or I'm going to feel bad and stand around andmake you feel bad too.\" When he is not there to behave in thatway, then there's nobody to make you feel good. So you feel bad."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Going Wrong 63When he comes back, you say, \"You were not here to have thesebehaviors to make me feel good, so I want you to feel bad now.I want you to be here all the time. No more bowling; don't goaway for the weekend and go fishing; don't go to college; don'tgo to seminars; be here all the time. I can go away because Ihave a good time when I do, but when I come home you haveto be here to make me feel good. If you love me you will dowhat I want, because when you don't do it, I feel bad, because Ilove you.\" Bizarre, huh? But that's how it works. And in a way,it's true. You sit there by yourself and you do feel bad. \"If thatperson were here doing this, I'd feel good. What the hell's thematter with him?\" Of course, if he's there and he's not willing todo it, that's even worse! People seldom stop and say, \"Hey, what'sgoing to be important to someone else?\" It's even rarer thatsomeone asks himself, \"What could I do that would make herwant to do this for me?\"If you feel inside you that when you don't get a certainamount of time from him, at the specified moment, then it's timeto feel bad . . . and if you measure that bad feeling and youvisualize him and connect that bad feeling with his face, thenwhen he comes back and you see his face, you get to feel badwhen he is there! That is amazing! Not only do you get to feelbad when he is not there; you also get to feel bad when he comesback! That doesn't sound like fun, does it? It's not fair to you tolive that way.And if he feels guilty about being gone, and he pictures whatit will be like to come back to you, he will connect the feelingof guilt to the sight of your face. Then when he comes back andsees you, he will feel guilty again, and he won't want to be thereeither. These are the meta-patterns of obligation. They are bothbased on one tremendous error: the idea that marriage is apersonal debt.If you ask people what they want, they usually talk aboutwanting what they don't have, rather than what they already dohave. They tend to ignore and take for granted what they alreadyhave and enjoy, and only notice what is missing.Married people don't usually feel lucky, the way they didwhen they first met.

And if he isn't there at a time whenyou want him—because he is doing something you wish hewouldn't do, because you don't want to do it with him—you stillfeel lucky that your special person is there for you much of thetime. And when he's doing something else, you feel lucky that'sthe only price you have to pay. That isn't a heavy cost, is it? Ifyou can't have that, then personally, I don't think it's worth it.One thing that has always amazed me is that people areseldom nasty to strangers. You really have to know and lovesomeone before you can treat her like dirt and really make herfeel bad about small things. Few people will yell at a strangerabout important things like crumbs on the breakfast table, but ifyou love her, it's OK.One family came in to see me and the husband was reallynasty. He pointed to his wife and snarled, \"She thinks a 14-year-old girl should stay out until 9:30 at night!\"I looked him straight in the eye and said, \"And you thinkthat a 14-ycar-old girl should learn that men yell and scream attheir wives, and make them feel bad!\"It's an awful thing to get lost.Often a family will bring in a teenage daughter because thereis something wrong with her; she enjoys sex and they can't gether to stop doing it. Talk about an idealistic, overwhelming,outrageous task: to get somebody to go back to being a virgin!The parents want you to convince their daughter that sex is notreally pleasant, and that it is dangerous, and that if she enjoys it,it's going to influence her in a way that will make her feel badfor the rest of her life! Some therapists actually attempt that task,. . . and some even succeed.One father literally dragged his daughter in to me with herarm twisted up behind her back, shoved her into a chair, andgrowled \"Siddown!\"\"Is anything wrong?\" I asked.\"The girl's a little whore!\"\"I don't need a whore; what did you bring her here for?\"That's an interruption if ever there was one!

You don't understand—\"\"And you brought her here to me\\ How disgusting!\"\"No, no, no! You've got it all wrong.\"This man who came in snarling and yelling, is now pleadingwith me to understand him.

But how would you like it if the only way shelearned to interact with men was the way you brought her in thatdoor a few minutes ago? And she waited until she was twenty-five and married somebody who beat her up, threw her around,abused her, and forced her to do things against her will.\"\"But she may make a mistake, and it will hurt her.\"\"That's possible.

They haven'tnoticed that what they're trying to learn will give them exactlywhat they don't want.When something happens that you don't like, you can alwayssay, \"It's your fault; I'm going to destroy you.\" That was probablypretty useful out in the jungle. But consciousness has got to evolveto the point where you say, \"I've got a brain. Let's back up alittle bit, keep in mind what I want, and go for it.\"So every single time you feel bad about anything and youfeel stuck, ... or especially right, ... or righteous, ... I hopethere is a little voice inside your head that says, \"You're gettingwhat you deserve!\" And if you feel that there's nothing you cando about it, you're right—until you go inside your brain and backup, back up, back up, so you can move forward and go for it inanother way."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"VGoing For ItIn an attempt to understand why people do things, the fieldof psychotherapy has developed many models that they later foundout simply weren't the case. However, many psychologists con-tinue to hang on to them. We still have people who are lookingfor Ids and Egos, and they're as likely to find that as a \"parent,\"a \"child,\" or an \"adult.\" I think that most psychologists must havewatched too many horror movies when they were children. \"Youhave a parent, an adult, and a child inside you that make you dothings,\" It sounds like you need to be exorcised. People used tosay, \"The devil, made me do it.\" Now they say, \"My parts mademe do it.\"\"Well, you're just saying this because your 'parent' is talking.\"No I'm not; she's all the way back in New Jersey!\"Transactional Analysis is a device for separating behaviorsinto three parts—a little like multiple personality, except TA issupposed to be a cure. If you're really advanced, you get to havenine parts, because each of the first three parts has a parent,adult, and child inside of them] I never liked TA because onlythe child got to have any fun, and only the adult could bereasonable. Everyone has to have exactly the same parts, sothere's no room for any individuality. TA is also a segregatedsociety: my adult can't talk to your child, it can only talk to youradult. Why can't my child talk to your parent? It doesn't seemlair. But boy, can you convince people of that. How many of you69"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70 Using Your Brainbought that idea? Somebody explained it to you, and you thought,\"Oh, yeah.\" Not everybody in the world has a parent, adult, andchild that argue with each other. You won't find much of that inTahiti. You have to go to a therapist to learn to have thoseproblems.How many of you have a \"critical parent\" voice inside youthat berates you and tries to coerce you into doing things? Ifsomebody suggests to you that there's a voice inside you thatcriticizes you all the time, and you start listening for it, guesswhat? You can install one. One interesting thing you can do is toagree with that critical voice, over and over again, until you driveit crazy. Another thing you can do is to change its location. Findout what happens if you hear that same voice coining out of yourleft big toe, . . . That change in location certainly changes theimpact of that voice, doesn't it?However, keep in mind that your critical voice could be rightabout what it's saying. Maybe you ought to listen to what it says,instead of just feeling bad. I'd like to show you what you can dowith a critical voice that makes you feel bad; who has a nice loudone?Fred: I've got one all the time.Good. Can you hear it now?Fred: Yes, it's criticizing me for speaking up.Great. Ask if it will tell you what it wants for you that ispositive, and listen to what it answers. Does that voice want youto be protected in some way? Does it want you to be morecompetent? There are many possibilities.Fred: It wants me to succeed; it criticizes me when I stickmy neck out.OK, I assume that you agree with its intention. You want tosucceed, too, right?Fred: Yes. Sure.Ask that voice if it believes it has good information thatwould be useful for you to have and understand. . . .Fred: It says, \"Of course.\"Since it has good information, ask that voice if it would bewilling to try changing the way it talks to you, if that would make"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Going For It 71it easier for you to listen and understand, so that you couldsucceed better. . . .Fred: It's skeptical, but it's willing to try.Good. Now, Fred, I want to ask you to think of ways thatvoice could be different, so that you would listen to it better. Forinstance, if it used a different voice tone that was soft and friendly,would you be more apt to pay close attention to it? Would it helpif that voice gave you specific helpful instructions about what todo next, rather than criticize what you've already done?Fred: I've thought of a couple of things it could do differently.Good. Ask the voice if it would be willing to try those out,to find out if you actually do listen better if it talks to youdifferently. . . .Fred: It's willing.Tell it to go ahead and try it out. . . .Fred: That's amazing. It's doing it, and it's not a \"criticalparent\" any more. It's more like a friendly helper now. It's apleasure to listen to it.Sure. Who wants to listen to a voice that yells and criticizes?Real parents should try this technique too, when they want theirkids to listen to them. If you use a nice tonality, children willlisten to you. They may not agree with what you say, but at leastthey'll hear it. This procedure is something we've been calling\"Refraining,\" and it's the basis for a set of negotiation skills thatare useful in family therapy and business, as well as inside yourown brain. If you want to learn more about it, read the bookReframing. The point I want to make here is that Fred's voicehad forgotten its outcome until I reminded it. It wanted to mo-tivate him to succeed, but all it was actually accomplishing wasto make him feel bad.While the women's liberation movement has had much pos-itive impact, in some ways it has done the same thing. The originalgoal was to motivate people to change the way they think aboutand treat women. Women got educated about what kinds ofbehaviors are sexist. Now when someone else makes a sexistremark, you have to feel bad! It doesn't strike me as progressthat now the \"liberated\" people have to feel bad when someoneelse uses a sexist word! What kind of liberation is that? That's"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"72 Using Your Brainjust like being a kid, and when someone called you \"stupid\" or\"ugly,\" it was time to feel bad and cry. People used to use sexistwords and nobody noticed; now when they use those words, it'stime to groan. Some liberation! Now you have a new set of reasonsto feel bad. I used to go around to night clubs and pick outwomen who would react that way. \"There's a good one. Watchthis. I can make her feel terrible.\" \"Hi chick.\" \"Arrgghh!\"If you don't want people to use sexist language, it makesbetter sense to make them feel bad when they do it. That's a lotmore fun, and a lot more effective, . . . and a lot more liberated,too.One thing I like to do is go after women when they makesexist remarks.A woman will say, \"Well, the girls in the office—\"\"How old are they?\"\"Huh? They're in their 30V\"You call them girls! They're women, you sexist pig! Do youcall your husband a boy?\"If you do something to make people feel bad when they makesexist remarks, that at least puts the motivation to change whereit belongs—in the person whose behavior you want to change.However, criticizing and attacking people really isn't the best wayto get them to change. The best way is to discover how theyalready motivate themselves, and use that.If you ask a lot of weird questions, and if you're persistent,you can find out how anyone does anything, including motivation.Many people are troubled by \"lack of motivation,\" and one ex-ample of that is not being able to get up in the morning. If westudy those people, we can find out how not to wake up, whichcould be of use to insomniacs. Everything that people can do isuseful to someone, somewhere, sometime. But let's find out howsomeone wakes up easily and quickly, without drugs. Who in hereregularly wakes up easily in the morning?Betty: I get up easily.OK. How do you get yourself up?Betty: I just wake myself up.I need a little more detail than that. How do you know whenyou are awake? What is the first thing that you are aware of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Going For It 73when you are awake? Does the alarm wake you up, or do youjust wake up, typically?Betty: I don't have an alarm. I just realize that I'm notsleeping.How do you realize that you are not sleeping? Do you beginto talk to yourself? Do you start to see something?Betty: I tell myself.What do you tell yourself?Betty: \"I'm awake. I'm waking up.\"What allowed you to know that you could say that? The voicethat says, \"I'm waking up,\" is notifying you that there is some-thing to notice, so something must have preceded the voice. Wasthe voice commenting on a feeling, or was there suddenly lightcoming in? Something changed. Go back and remember it so thatyou can go through it sequentially.Betty: I think it was a feeling.What kind of a feeling? Warmth? Pressure?. . . .Betty: Warm, yes.Did you go from warmer to cooler, or from cooler to warmer?Betty: The sensation of warmth became intensified. I felt mybody get warmer.As you began to become aware of warm feelings, you saidto yourself, \"I'm waking up.\" What happens right after that? Youhaven't seen anything yet? No internal images?Betty: I said, \"I have to get up.\"Is the voice loud? Are there any other sounds, or is therejust a voice in there? Does it have tone?Betty: It is a very calm voice, it's an easy voice.Does the tone of that voice inside change as you begin towake up more and more?Betty: Yes. It speeds up and becomes more clear and distinct,more alert.This is an example of what we call a motivation strategy. It'snot the whole thing, but it's enough to give us the key piece thatmakes it work to get her to do something. She has an internalvoice that sounds like a sleepy, calm voice. Then as it says, \"Ihave to get up,\" it begins to speed up and change that tone toon that is more awake and alert."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 Using Your BrainI want all the rest of you to try this. Doing it yourself is howyou really find out about how other people do things. You don'thave to say the same words, but take a moment to close youreyes, feel your body, and then listen to a voice inside your head.Have that voice begin to talk to you in a tone that is sleepy andcalm. . . , Now have that voice speed up a little, become a littlelouder and more alert. Notice how your feelings change. . . ,Does that affect the way you feel? If it doesn't, check yourpulse. An excited internal voice is a great way to wake yourselfup whenever you need it. If you start talking to yourself andputting yourself to sleep at a time when you probably shouldn't,like on the freeway, you can learn to raise the volume and pitch,talk a little faster about something that is exciting, and it willwake you right up.This is what many insomniacs do. They talk to themselves ina loud, high-pitched, excited voice, and it wakes them up—evenif they're talking about how much they need to sleep. Insomniacstend to be very alert and motivated. They think they don't sleepmuch, but studies have found that they actually sleep about asmuch as everybody else. What's different is that they also spenda lot of time trying to go to sleep, but they keep waking themselvesup with their tone of voice.The other main way to have insomnia is to look at lots ofbright, flashing pictures, I asked one client what he did and hesaid, \"Well, I start thinking about all the things that I may notbe thinking about.\" I went home that night and tried it. \"Whatis it I'm not thinking about?\" Soon it was six in the morning,and I thought, \"I know what it is—sleep!\"Now I want you to change your internal voice back the otherway. Make it softer, lower, slower and sleepier, and notice howthat makes you feel. , . .Once I almost lost an audience doing this. Open your eyesand speed up that voice again, or you'll have to get the rest ofthis seminar unconsciously. This is something you can teach in-somniacs, and it's also a process you can use yourself wheneveryou need it. For instance, I've learned that the best thing I cando on an airplane is to go unconscious. Between my house and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Going For It 75the main airport is a short 20-minute flight. As soon as I sit downin the seat—sst—I'm out.Man: When you're finding out how someone motivates her-self, how do you know that you have gotten to the beginning ofthe sequence? For instance, Betty was saying the voice that wastalking to her started getting louder. How do you know whatquestions to ask at that point?That depends on your purpose in asking the questions. Thereis really no way to determine where somebody starts. You justneed to get enough detail so that you can create the same expe-rience. If I do it myself, and it works, then I've probably gotenough information. The way to test these things is in experience—your own or someone else's.Once I know someone's motivation strategy, I can literallymotivate her to get out of a chair or do anything else by havingher go through the same process: \"Feel the chair, say to yourself,'I have to get up.' Change your tonality and say it again in avoice that is faster, louder, and more alert.\" Whatever the processis that you use to get up in the morning, you probably use thesame process to get yourself to walk downstairs to pick up a book,or to do anything else.There are a lot of different ways that people use to motivatethemselves. Rather than just tell you about them, I want you toget some experience of finding out about them on your own. Pairup with someone you don't know, and find out how she gets upout of bed in the morning. Everybody here had to do it at leastthis morning; the ones who can't do it didn't make it to thisseminar. Start by asking simply, \"How do you get up in themorning?\" Your partner will give you one or two fairly generalstatements about what she does, and you'll have to ask morequestions to get the rest of the details.When you think you have the whole sequence, try it yourselfto see if it works for you. For instance, your partner might say,I see the light coining in through the windows, and I say tomyself, 'get up' and I get up.\" If you try that yourself—you lookat light in the windows and say to yourself \"get up\"—you don'tnecessarily get up. It's not quite enough. You have to do morethan that to make it work. People do these things automatically"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76 Using Your Brainand unconsciously, so often you have to ask a lot of questions inorder to get all the pieces.Since this isn't a strategies seminar, I don't insist that youget every little detail. But I do want you to get the basic piecesin the sequence, and get the key piece that makes a difference.That will usually be an element that changes in a crucial way.With Betty, it was a change in voice tone that actually got herup. To find that out, you really have to be a stickler for detail.If somebody says, \"I make a picture of myself getting up,\" youhave to ask for more detail. \"Is it a movie? Is it a slide? Does ithave color? Is it big? Do you say anything to yourself? Whattone of voice do you use?\" These small details are what makethe sequence work. Some of them will be much more effectivethan others, and you can find that out by changing them one ata time, and noticing the impact. Pair up now and try this; takeabout fifteen minutes each. . . .Well, what did you find in there? How does your partnermotivate himself? What were the key pieces in the sequence?Bill: My partner first hears the alarm clock, and he looks atit as he turns it off. Then he lies down again, and feels howcomfortable he is in bed. An internal voice says, \"If you stay"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Going For It 77here, you'll go to sleep and be late,\" and he makes a picture ofa time when he was late to work, and feels bad. Then the voicesays, \"It will be worse next time,\" and he makes a bigger pictureof what will happen if he's late again, and feels worse. Thesequence seems to be \"voice, picture, bad feeling.\" When the badfeeling is strong enough, he gets up.That's what we call \"the old anxiety routine.\" You keepgenerating unpleasant feelings until you're motivated to avoidthem. Rollo May has that one. He even wrote a long book aboutit, which can be summarized in one sentence: \"Anxiety has beenmisunderstood; anxiety is good because it gets people to dothings.\"If your motivation strategy runs on anxiety, that's abso-lutely right. But not everyone has that kind of motivation. Forother people anxiety prevents them from accomplishing things.They think of doing something interesting, then they make apicture of how things could go wrong, then they feel anxious andjust sit at home.Suzi: I do something very similar to what Bill's partner does.I tell myself that I can rest for a few more minutes, and I do.But as time passes, my picture of being late gets bigger and closerand brighter. It stays the same picture, but when it's big enough,I have to get out of bed to stop the bad feelings.Do you procrastinate in other things? (Yes.) How many ofthe rest of you did term papers at the last minute? The longeryou waited, the more motivated you were. Bill's partner has hisown internal anxiety generator. Suzi's runs off the clock. Theyare both very similar in that they use unpleasant feelings as amotivator. Did any of you find an example of motivation thatused pleasant feelings—even to do an unpleasant task?Frank: Yes, Marge pictured all the things she was going todo during the day and felt good about doing them. She said thatthose pleasant pictures \"pulled her out of bed.\"What if she only had unpleasant things to do that day? Didyou ask her about that?Frank: Yes, I did. She said she made pictures of those thingsbeing all done, and felt wonderful that they were done. Thatgood feeling pulled her out of bed, too. That seemed unreal to"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"78 Using Your Brainme. I can't imagine that actually working, and I wanted to askyou about it.Where's Marge? . . . Marge, when do you do your taxes?Marge: I have them done by mid-January. It's so nice to havethem done, so I can do other things.Well, it certainly seems to work for her. Nobody enjoys doingtaxes, but most people enjoy having them done. The trick is tobe able to access that good feeling of having them done ahead oftime to get you started. Marge's motivation uses pleasant feelingsinstead of unpleasant ones. It's less common, and very strange toFrank, who does the opposite.Lots of people are good at motivating themselves to dopleasant things. They just make pictures of doing the pleasantthings, and are so attracted to these pictures that they start doingthem. However, that process doesn't work for things you want tohave done, but you don't like doing them, If you don't like doingtaxes, and you make a picture of doing them, you'll feel repelled.That's not motivating at all. If you want to get motivated posi-tively, you need to think about what's really attractive about atask. If you don't enjoy the task itself, what's attractive is havingit done.Actually there is another piece that needs to be there ifMarge's motivation strategy is going to work. How many of youhave thought about how nice it will be to have something done,and then you \"ran out of gas\" when you sat down and started onit?Marge, when you start on your taxes, what keeps you going?Marge: All along, I keep thinking about how nice it will bewhen they're all done.That's an important piece, but I'll bet you also do somethingelse.Marge: Well, each time I write down a number or fill in apiece of the form, I feel good about getting that little piece done,too. It's like a little taste of the good feeling I'll have when it'sall done.Right. Those two pieces are what keep you going, and thesecond one will be more effective than the first. If you just thinkof it all being done, and it takes some time to finish a project, it"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Going For It 79can get to seem like \"pie in the sky.\" But that good feeling ofaccomplishment you get every time you complete a small pieceof the task will sustain you through a lot of drudgery.Marge: That's interesting. It explains a lot of things in mylife. People have often called me a \"Pollyanna,\" because I'malways thinking of how good it will be when something unpleasantis over. I always get a lot done, but I've had trouble getting otherpeople to do unpleasant jobs. When I tell them about how niceit will be when it's done, I usually get a blank stare.Right. They just don't understand. That's not the way theymotivate themselves.Frank: It seems like you're saying that someone can be pow-erfully and effectively motivated without even having any unpleas-ant feelings. Is there any hope for the rest of us who propelourselves with anxiety?Sure. Like anything else people do, motivation strategies arelearned, and you can always learn another one. It's fairly easy toteach you how to use Marge's strategy. But you have to be carefulwhen you make such a pervasive change in someone's life,Some people make lousy decisions, but since they aren't verymotivated, they don't get into much trouble. If you teach them areally effective motivation strategy, they will actually carry out allthose bad decisions, and do a lot of stupid, irrelevant, and possiblyharmful things. So before I teach someone a powerful new mo-tivation strategy, I make sure that the person already has aneffective way of making decisions. If he doesn't, I'll teach him anew decision strategy before I teach him the new motivationstrategy.There arc a lot of variations in how people motivate them-selves, but we've already got examples of the two major patterns.Most people motivate themselves by thinking about how bad theywill feel if they don't do something, and then they move awayfrom that bad feeling. Rat psychologists call this \"aversive con-ditioning.\"A few people do the reverse, which is what Marge does. Sheuses pleasant feelings to move toward what she does want to havehappen, instead of away from what she doesn't want to havehappen—and she gets reinforcement along the way."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"80 Using Your BrainSomeone with a motivation strategy like Marge's really livesin an entirely different world than most people—a world withouta lot of the anxiety, unpleasantness, and stress that many peopleexperience.Many people have some combination of the two. They mayfirst think of what will happen if they don't do something, andthen think of how nice it will be when it's done.All motivation strategies work, and you can't knock some-thing that works. However, some of them are a lot faster andmore tenacious, and a lot more enjoyable than others.A lot of the problems that bring people into therapy, or intojail, have to do with motivation. Either they're not motivated todo things they want to do, or other people want them to do, orthey are motivated to do things they, or other people, don't wantthem to do. What we've done here today is explore a little bitabout how motivation works, so you can have some control overwhat you're motivated to do. What we've done here is only thebeginning of what we can do with motivation, but it gives yousomething you can explore more on your own."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"VIUnderstanding ConfusionMany people get into difficulties because they're confusedabout something. I'd like to show you how to take confusion andmake it into understanding. I need someone to play with, todemonstrate how this is done. After I demonstrate, I'm going toask you to pair up and do it with each other, so pay attention.Bill: I'd like to do that.First think of something you're confused about, and you'dlike to understand.Bill: There are a lot of things I don't understand—Stop. I want you to listen carefully to what I asked you todo, I did not ask you to think of something you don't understand;I asked you to think of something you're confused about. \"Con-fusion\" and \"not understanding\" are very different. There are alot of things that you don't understand, because you don't knowanything about them. You probably don't understand open-heartsurgery or how to design a hydrogen bomb. You're not confusedabout them; you just don't have the information you'd need tounderstand how to do those things.Confusion, however, is always an indication that you're onyour way to understanding. Confusion presupposes that you havea lot of data, but it's not yet organized in a way that allows youto understand it. So I want you to think of something you'reconfused about: something you have a lot of experience with, butit doesn't make sense to you. . . .S3"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"84 Using Your BrainBill: OK. I'm thinking about—Hold on. You're not allowed to tell me the content of whatyou're thinking about. You only need content if you are nosy.I'm a mathematician; I'm only interested inform. Besides it's tooeasy for the rest of these people to get lost in the content. I wantthem to learn the process that I'm demonstrating.You've thought of something you're confused about. Now Iwant you to think of something similar that you understand. WhenI say similar, I mean that if your confusion is about someone'sbehavior, have your \"understanding\" also be about someone'sbehavior. If your confusion has to do with how a car engineworks, make understanding be something mechanical, like howyour toaster works, for example.Bill: I've thought of something I understand.Now you have two internal experiences; we're calling one ofthem \"understanding\" and the other one \"confusion.\" Do theyboth have pictures?Bill: Yes.What I'm interested in are the differences between the two.How do they differ? For instance, one might be a movie and theother a slide. Or one might be in black and white and the otherin color. I want you to go inside and examine those two experi-ences, and then tell me how they're different. . . .Bill: Confusion is a slide, and it's small. Understanding is amovie, and it's large.Are there any other differences? If the picture of confusionis smaller, it's probably also farther away.Bill: Yes, it's farther away.Do either of them have sound?Bill: Yes, understanding has a voice describing what I see.Confusion is silent.How do you know that you're confused about one, but youunderstand the other one?Bill: I have different feelings when I look at those two pic-tures,OK. How do your feelings know to feel that when you lookat those pictures.Bill: I suppose because I taught it that."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Understanding Confusion 85I want you all to notice something. I asked a \"How?\" ques-tion, asking about process, and he answered a \"Why?\" question.\"Because\" always answers \"Why?\" All you'll get out of \"Because\"is a bunch of historical theory. I only have one theory: that thereason people have so much trouble running their brains is be-cause the Earth is tilted on its axis. So actually you have someoneelse's brain, and it's mad. That's as much theorizing as I do.Let's try again. Bill, how do you know to have differentfeelings when you look at those two different pictures? . . .Bill: I don't know.I like that answer.Bill: After I thought about it, I decided I didn't know.That happens sometimes. Pretend you know. Talk. The worstthing that can happen is that you can be wrong. Years ago Irealized I had been wrong so many times, I decided I'd just goahead and be wrong in the ways that were more interesting.Bill: When I look at the understanding picture, I can see howthings work. That gives me a soft feeling of relaxation. When Ilook at the other one, I can't see what's going to happen next; Ifeel a little tense.Those certainly sound like quite different experiences. Doesanyone have any questions about what I've been doing?Man: You make it look so easy. How do you know whatquestions to ask?All I want to know is, \"How are these two experiencesdifferent?\" The answers to that are specific differences in theperson's visual, auditory, and feeling experience. My questionsare often directed at what the person is not noticing, and theyare always directed toward helping that person make distinctionsthat he wasn't making before. For instance, when I asked Bill ifit was a slide or a movie, he could answer easily. But he probablynever even noticed that difference before, because no one everasked him about it.Woman: Is there any particular order to the questions youask? You asked about whether it was a slide or a movie beforeyou asked about color or black and white.There's a certain efficiency in asking about things first andqualities later; you'll go astray less often. If you ask \"How fast is"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86 Using Your Brainit moving?\" and it turns out to be a slide, that may be a littleconfusing to the person you're doing this with. Go for the basicsfirst, and then ask about what other finer distinctions might bethere.The questions you ask are also a function of familiarity. I'veexplored confusion and understanding a few times before, so Ialready know what kinds of differences are likely to be there. It'slike anything else you learn to do. When you do it the first time,you stumble around a bit. Later, when you're more familiar withwhat you're doing, you get more streamlined and systematic. Youcan also just make a long list of all the possibilities and go throughthem one by one. But it's easier if you first mention a few of themain distinctions to get that person's mind going in the rightdirection, and then ask, \"How are the two different?\"Now let's go on to the more interesting part. Bill, I want youto take \"confusion\" and change it until it's the same as \"under-standing.\" I don't want you to change the content. I only wantyou to change the process that you use to represent the samecontent. First I want you to take that slide and make it into amovie. . . .Bill: I can't seem to do that.Do it this way. First make a series of slides at different times.When you have enough of them, look at them in rapid succession.Speed that up a little, and you'll have a movie. A movie is onlya sequence of still pictures shown in a fast sequence.Bill: OK. I've got a movie.Good. Now add a narrative sound track that describes themovie. . . . (Bill nods.)Now make that movie larger and closer until it's the samesize and distance as your picture of understanding. . . . Whathappens when you do that? Do you understand it now?Bill: Yes. I can see what's going on now; I feel much morecomfortable. I have the same feeling with both pictures.It makes sense that if you have a large movie with a narrativesound track, you'll understand something better than if all youhave is a small, silent, still picture. You have much more infor-mation, and it's organized in a way that you can comprehend it.This is Bill's natural way of learning how to understand something."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Understanding Confusion 87Woman: Don't you have to have more information to getunconfused?Sometimes that's the case. But often the person actually hasthe information; it just hasn't been accessed in a way that allowsunderstanding. It's not that something is missing; it's just thatwhat you have is poorly organized. You all know much more thanyou think you do. Usually it's not too little information thatcreates confusion, it's having too much information. Often a per-son's confusion is an enormous collage of data, or a lot of picturesflipping in rapid succession. In contrast, most people's pictures ofunderstanding are well-organized, and very economical. They'relike an elegant mathematical equation, or a good poem. Theydistill a lot of data down to a very simple representation. What Idid with Bill just made it possible for him to collect the data thathe already had, in a way that he could understand it. Being ableto use your mind means being able to access, organize and usewhat you already have.Most of you have seen what happens when a fire burns downin a fireplace. If you rearrange the logs a little bit, it will blazeup again. You haven't added anything. The only thing you'vechanged is the arrangement, but it makes a huge difference.If you think that you need more data, you'll probably asklots of questions. If the answers just contain raw data, they won'thelp you much, and you'll have to keep asking. The more answersyou have, the less you will examine the questions you are asking.But if the answers help you organize the data you already have,it may help you to understand. That is what's often called \"passivelearning,\" someone who's always going, \"Spoon-feed me.\" Otherpeople can take in a large amount of data and organize it them-selves without much help from outside. That's what's often called\"active learning.\"Now, Bill, I want you to try it the other way. Take what youoriginally understood and make it into a smaller, more distant,still picture and erase the sound track. . . .Bill: Now I'm tense and confused.So now we could take anything you're sure of, and confusethe hell out of you. You're all laughing; you don't realize howuseful that can be! Don't you know someone who is sure they"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88 Using Your Brainunderstand something, and they don't? . . . and that false confi-dence gets them into a lot of trouble? A good dose of confusioncould get them motivated to listen to people around them andgather some very useful information. Confusion and understand-ing are internal experiences. They don't necessarily have anythingto do with the outside world. In fact, if you look around, thereusually isn't much connection.In order for Bill to have the experience he calls \"understand-ing,\" he has to go through a process in which the information hehas is represented as a large movie with a sound track. Thishappens randomly sometimes, and at other times other peoplemay induce it. However, now that he knows how it works, hecan deliberately engage that process whenever he is confusedabout something. If he hasn't got enough data, he may not cometo full understanding; his movie may have gaps in it, or the soundtrack may fade out from time to time. But it will be the bestrepresentation for him of what he knows. Those gaps in the moviewill indicate precisely where he needs to have more information.And whenever he's bored with what he already understands toowell, he can confuse himself as a prelude to coming to some newand different understanding.Now I want you all to take turns doing what I did with Bill.Pair up with someone you don't know, because that will make iteasier.1) Ask your partner to think of a) something he is confusedabout, and b) something similar he understands. Your partner isnot allowed to tell you anything about the content.2) Ask,\"How are these two experiences different?\" You don'tcare about how they're similar, only how one is different fromthe other,3) When you have at least two differences, ask your partnerto change confusion to be the same as understanding.4) Test what you've done by asking if he understands whatwas previously confusing. If he understands, you're done. If hedoesn't understand, back up to step 2) and find some moredifferences. Keep going until either he understands, or he hasidentified what specific lack of information is preventing full un-derstanding. Keep in mind that no one ever totally understands"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Understanding Confusion 89anything. That's OK. It keeps life interesting. Take about fifteenminutes each. . . .Most of you have probably noticed that your partner didsomething different inside than you do, in regard to the words\"understanding\" and \"confusion.\" Let's first hear some of thedifferences you found, and then deal with any questions,Man: My confusion is like a TV set with the vertical holdout of adjustment. The pictures keep rolling over so fast I can'tsee them. When I slowed it down and steadied it, it all madesense. But for my partner, confusion was a close panorama. Somuch was happening so close around her that she couldn't takeit all in. She had to slow it down, and then physically back upand see it at a distance to understand it.Man: My partner is a scientist. When he's confused, he justsees movies of things happening—what he calls \"raw data.\" Whenhe starts to understand, he sees little diagrams superimposed onthe movies. These diagrams help him condense the events, andthe movies get shorter and shorter until he gets what he calls a\"moving still picture.\" It's a still picture with a superimposeddiagram that indicates all the different ways that still picture canturn into a movie. That still picture sort of wiggles a little bit.It's very economical."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"90 Using Your BrainThat's a great one. Do these make sense to the rest of you?We've got quite a variety already.Woman: When I really understand something, I have fivedifferent clear pictures all at once, like a split-screen TV. WhenI'm confused I only have one picture, and it's fuzzy. But whenmy partner understands something it's always over here on herright side. Things she's confused about are in the center, andsomething she doesn't know anything about arc over on her left.Alan: What my partner did seemed very unusual to me. Herconfusion was very focused and specific, and her understandingwas a fuzzy, bright, movie that was out of focus. When she fuzzedup the confusion, she felt like she understood. I said to her, \"Turnthe knob, adjust the lens to get it out of focus.\"You can do it that way, but you don't have to be metaphorical.People don't actually have knobs; you can just tell them to do it.So when she fuzzed it up, she understood. I hope she's not aheart surgeon! That's one of the strangest ones I've ever heard.If you blur the image, then you understand it! It certainly isdifferent from the other ones we've gotten here. Did that seemodd to her, too?Alan: Yes, it did, Could that be like turning it over to somelower-level unconscious process that you trust?No, I don't accept explanations like that. All these processesare unconscious until you ask someone about them. There aremany things we do intuitively, but this is different. Of course, youmay have missed something important. But assuming that yourdescription is correct, her understanding can't be connected withdoing anything. In order to do something you have to have somespecific detail. That's why I made that crack about hoping shewasn't a heart surgeon. With her kind of understanding, herpatients wouldn't have a very high survival rate.However, a fuzzy, bright understanding will be good for somethings. For example, this is probably someone who would be lotsof fun at a party. She'll be a very responsive person, because allshe needs to do to feel like she understands what someone saysis to fuzz up her pictures. It doesn't take a lot of information tobe able to make a bright, fuzzy movie. She can do that reallyquickly, and then have a lot of feelings watching that bright movie."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Understanding Confusion 91Imagine what would happen if that woman married someonewho had to have things crystal clear in order to understand, He'dsay things like, \"Now let's bring this into focus,\" and that wouldsend her into confusion. When she described things she under-stood, they wouldn't be clear to him. If he complained that whatshe said was all fuzzy, she'd smile and be perfectly satisfied, buthe'd be frustrated.Her kind of understanding is the kind I talked about earlier,that doesn't have much to do with the outside world. It helps herfeel better, but it won't be much help in coping with actualproblems. It would be really useful for her to have another wayof understanding—one that's more precise and specific.In the last seminar I did there was a man whose \"understand-ing\" wasn't very useful for him. So he tried out the understandingprocess that his partner went through. Doing that gave him atotally new way of understanding that opened up a whole newworld for him.What I want you all to realize is that all of you are in thesame position as that man, and the woman who fuzzes images.No matter how good you think your process of understanding is,there will always be times and places where another process wouldwork much better for you. Earlier someone gave us the processa scientist used—economical little pictures with diagrams. Thatwill work marvellously well for the physical world, but I'll predictthat person has difficulties understanding people—a commonproblem for scientists. (Man: Yes, that's true.) People arc a littletoo complex for a little diagram like that. Some other way ofunderstanding will work better for people. The more ways youhave of understanding, the more possibilities open up for you,and the more your abilities expand.I'd like you all to try this experience of having someone else'sunderstanding. Pair up with the same partner you had before.You already know something about that person's confusion andunderstanding, as well as your own. However, you do need togather a little more information. You already found and listed thedifferences between your confusion and understanding, as well asyour partner's. You haven't yet listed all the differences betweenyour understanding and your partner's confusion. You'll have a"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92 Using Your Brainlot of that information already, but you have probably missedsome elements that were the same in what you compared earlier.After you have full information about the difference betweenyour understanding and your partner's confusion, pick any contentthat you understand, and first make it into your partner's confu-sion. Then make whatever changes are necessary to make it intotheir understanding. Your partner can give you directions and bea consultant to you, advising and answering any questions youmay have. After you've tried out their understanding, compareyour experience to your partner's, to see if they're the same. Youmay miss something on the first try, and have to go back and doit again. The goal is for you to experience someone else's way ofunderstanding. After you try it out, you may decide it's not a verygood one, and you may not want to use it very often. But don'tbe too sure about that; it may work exquisitely for something youhave trouble with. At the very least it will help you to understandcertain people who use that process.

What did you experience whenyou took on someone else's understanding?Man: My own understanding is very detailed, so I understandmechanical things very easily. My partner's understanding was alot more abstract: she sees fuzzy rainbows when she understandssomething. When I tried out her understanding I couldn't under-stand mechanical things at all, but I had a sense of understandingpeople much better. Actually, I think I wouldn't call it \"under-standing\" so much as feeling what they meant and being able torespond to them easily. The colors were magnificent, and I feltsort of warm and excited the whole time. It certainly was different!Woman: When I understand something, I just see detailedmovies of that event happening. My partner sees two overlappingframed pictures when he understands something. The closer pic-ture is an associated picture of the event, and the second pictureis a dissociated picture of the same event. He feels he understandswhen the two pictures match. My partner's an actor, and I realizedhow useful it must be to him. When he's playing a part he'sassociated, and he also has the other dissociated picture that showshim what the audience is seeing at the same time. When I tookon his understanding, I had a lot more information about how Ilook to other people. That was very helpful to me because Iusually just jump into situations without thinking about how otherpeople see me.That sounds pretty useful. Taking on someone else's way ofunderstanding is the ultimate way to enter that person's world.How many of you already had more or less the same way ofunderstanding as your partner had? . . . About 8 out of 60. Hereyou just picked people at random, It's even more fascinating ifyou choose very successful people. I'm a pragmatist; I like to findout how really exceptional people do things. A very successfulbusinessman in Oregon did the following with any project hewanted to understand: he'd start with a slide and expand it sothat it was fully panoramic and he was inside it. Then he'd convertit into a movie. At any point where he had trouble seeing wherethe movie was going, he'd step back slightly and see himself init. As soon as the movie started moving again, he'd step backinside. That's an example of a very practical understanding that"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"94 Using Your Brainis intimately related to actually doing something. For him, un-derstanding something and being able to do it are indistinguish-able.Understanding is a process that is vital to survival and learn-ing. If you weren't able to make sense out of your experience insome way, you'd be in big trouble. Each of us has about threepounds of gray matter that we use to try to understand the world.That three pounds of jelly can do some truly amazing things, butthere's no way it can fully understand anything. When you thinkyou understand something, that is always a definition of what youdon't know. Karl Popper said it well: \"Knowledge is a sophisti-cated statement of ignorance.\" There are several kinds of under-standing, and some of them are a lot more useful than others.One kind of understanding allows you to justify things, andgives you reasons for not being able to do anything different.\"Things are this way because . . . and that's why we can't changeanything.\" Where I grew up, we called that a \"jive\" excuse. Alot of \"experts' \" understanding of things like schizophrenia andlearning disabilities is like that. It sounds very impressive, butbasically it's a set of words that say, \"Nothing can be done.\"Personally, I'm not interested in \"understandings\" that lead youto a dead end, even if they might be true. I'd rather leave itopen.A second kind of understanding simply allows you to have agood feeling: \"Ahhh.\" That woman who de-focuses pictures to getunderstanding is an example of that. It's sort of like salivating toa bell: it's a conditioned response, and all you get is that goodfeeling. That's the kind of thing that can lead to saying, \"Oh,yes, 'ego' is that one up there on the chart. I've seen that before;yes, I understand.\" That kind of understanding also doesn't teachyou to be able to do anything.A third, kind of understanding allows you to talk about thingswith important sounding concepts, and sometimes even equations.How many of you have an \"understanding\" about some behaviorin yourself that you don't like, but that understanding hasn'thelped you behave differently? That's an example of what I'mtalking about. Concepts can be useful, but only if they have an"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Understanding Confusion 95experiential basis, and only if they allow you to do somethingdifferent.You can often get someone to accept an idea consciously, butonly seldom will that lead to a change in behavior. If there's onething that's been proved beyond a doubt by most of the religionsof the world, that's it. Take \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for instance. Itdoesn't say \"except ...\" Nevertheless, the crusaders happilysliced Moslems in two, and the Moral Majority wants more mis-siles to wipe out a few more million Russians.Often people in seminars will ask, \"Is a visual person thesame as the 'parent' in TA?\" That tells me they are taking whatI'm teaching and stuffing it into the concepts they already have.If you can make something new fit into what you already know,you will learn nothing from it, and nothing will change in yourbehavior. You will only have a comfortable feeling of understand-ing, a complacency that will keep you from learning anythingnew.Often I'll demonstrate how to change a person in minutes,and someone will say, \"Don't you think he was just fulfilling theexpectations of the role situation?\" I've rolled a few drunks, butI've never rolled a situation. Those are the people who come toseminars and get nothing for their money, because they leave withexactly the same understanding that they brought with them.The only kind of understanding I'm interested in is the kindthat allows you to do something. All our seminars teach specifictechniques that allow you to do things. That seems simple. Butsometimes the things I teach don't fit into your existing under-standing. The healthiest thing you can do at that moment is tobecome confused, and many people complain about how confusingI am. They don't yet realize that confusion is the doorway to anew understanding. Confusion is an opportunity to rearrange ex-perience and organize it in a different way than you normallywould. That allows you to learn to do something new and to seeand hear the world in a new way. Hopefully the last exercise gaveyou a concrete experience of how that works, and the kind ofimpact that can have.If you understood everything I said, and never got confused,that would be a sure sign that you were learning nothing of"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"96 Using Your Brainsignificance, and wasting the money you paid to come here. Thatwould be proof that you are continuing to understand the worldin exactly the same way as when you got here. So whenever youget confused, you can get excited about the new understandingthat awaits you. And you can be grateful for this opportunity togo somewhere new, even though you don't yet know where it willtake you. If you don't like where it takes you, you can alwaysleave. At the very least you will be enriched by knowing aboutit, and knowing that you don't like it.Some people's understanding has uncertainty built into it. Iknow an engineer whose understanding is composed of a rectan-gular matrix of pictures, about eight rows down and eight columnsacross. He starts thinking he understands something when thematrix is about half full of pictures. When it's about ninety percentfull, he knows he understands something pretty thoroughly. How-ever, his matrix always has empty frames which signify that hisunderstanding is always incomplete. That keeps him from evergetting too sure about anything.One of my most capable student's understanding is a disso-ciated movie of herself doing whatever it is she understands. Whenshe wants to actually do it, she steps into the movie—doing andunderstanding are nearly identical. Behind that movie is a succes-sion of movies of herself doing it in different situations, doing itwhile overcoming obstacles, etc. The more different movies shehas, the surer she is that she understands something well. I onceasked her, \"How many movies do you have to have to understandsomething?\" She replied, \"It's always a question of how well Iunderstand it. If I have a few movies, that gives me a littleunderstanding. If I have more movies, I understand better. Themore different movies I have, the more I understand it. But Inever understand completely.\"In contrast, there are people who are completely confidentthat they understand how to do something if they have a singlemovie of having done it, I know one man who flew a plane once,so he was completely sure that he could fly any plane, anywhere,anytime, in any weather, while standing up in a hammock! Hecame to a five-day seminar of mine, learned one pattern and left"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Understanding Confusion 97at noon the first day, totally confident that he knew all of NLP.How's that for getting stuck?Getting stuck in a particular way of understanding theworld—whatever it is—is the cause of three major human diseasesthat I'd like to do something about. The first one is seriousness,as in \"dead serious.\" If you decide that you want to do something,fine, but getting serious about it will only blind you and get inyour way.Being right, or certain, is the second disease. Certainty iswhere people stop thinking and stop noticing. Any time you feelabsolutely certain of something, that's a sure sign that you havemissed something. It's sometimes convenient to deliberately ignoresomething for a while, but if you're absolutely certain, you'llprobably miss it forever.It's easy for certainty to sneak up on you. Even people whoare uncertain are usually certain about that, too. Either they'resure they're sure, or they're sure they're unsure. Rarely do youfind someone who is uncertain about his doubt or uncertain abouthis certainty. You can create that experience, but you don't usuallyencounter it. You can ask someone, \"Are you sure enough to beunsure?\" That's a stupid question, but he won't be sure anymoreafter you ask it.The third disease is importance, and self-importance is theworst of all. As soon as one thing is \"important,\" then otherthings aren't. Importance is a great way to justify being mean anddestructive, or doing anything else that's unpleasant enough toneed justification.These three diseases are the way most people get stuck. Youmay decide something is important, but you can't get really seriousabout it until you're certain that it's important. At that point youstop thinking altogether. The Ayatollah Khomeni is an excellentexample—but you can find lots of other examples closer to home.Once I pulled up in front of the grocery store in a smalltown I used to live near. A guy came running over and saidangrily, \"My friend said you flipped me off\"\"I don't think so; do you want me to?\"\"Let me tell you something—\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"98 Using Your BrainI said, \"Wait just one minute,\" and went into the store andshopped.When I came back out, he was still out there! When I walkedup to my car, he was panting with anger. I picked up a bag ofgroceries and handed it to him, and he took it. I opened the cardoor, put the other three bags in the car, took the bag from himand got in the car and closed the door. Then I said, \"All right,if you insist\" flipped the bird at him, and started to drive away.As I drove away he burst out laughing hysterically, becauseI simply would not take him seriously.For most people, \"getting stuck\" is wanting something andnot getting it. Very few people can pause at that point andquestion their certainty that this thing is seriously important tothem. However, there is another kind of being stuck that no onenotices: Not wanting something and not having it. That is thegreatest limitation of all, because you don't even know you'restuck, I'd like you to think about something that you now rec-ognize is very useful or enjoyable or pleasurable. . . .Now go back to an earlier time in your life, when you didn'teven know about that, or you knew about it but it didn't meananything to you. ...You really didn't know what you were missing, did you? Youhad no idea how you were stuck back there, and you weren'tmotivated to change it. You were certain that your understandingwas an accurate representation of the world. That's when you'rereally stuck. What are you missing now? . . .Certainty probably impedes human progress more than anyother state of mind. However, certainty, like anything else, is asubjective experience that you can change. Pick a fairly detailedmemory in which you were absolutely certain that you understoodsomething.

And that added a new dimensionto the learning of the touching on the water.It gave you another perspective. Now do you know anythingmore about landing a plane than you did before?Ben: Yeah.What else don't you know? Yet? That's quite a lot to getfrom just running a movie backwards.

Nowsequence them 2-1, first you can't, and then can, do some-thing. . . . Those are pretty different, aren't they?The experiences in your life happened to you in a certainorder. Most of that sequence wasn't planned; it just happened. Alot of your understanding is based on that somewhat randomsequence, Since you have only one sequence, you have only oneset of understandings, and that will limit you. If the same eventshad happened to you in a different order, your understandingswould be very different, and you would respond very differently.You have a whole personal history that's the wealth thatyou're going to use to go into the future. How you use it willdetermine what it will produce. If you only have one way of usingit, you'll be very limited.

A hundred years from now peopleare going to look at our \"high-tech\" economy and shake theirheads the way we do when we think of ox-carts.Real innovation would have been easier right at the begin-ning.

For example, youprobably wouldn't be learning about NLP if you didn't believethat it would be interesting, or useful, or somehow valuable.Parents wouldn't spend lots of time with their infant children ifthey didn't believe it would make their children turn out betterlater on. Parents used to keep young children from getting toomuch stimulation because they believed it would make them hy-peractive; now they give their children lots of stimulation becausethey believe it will aid their intellectual development.Beliefs are really phenomenal things.

Bring it back to its original size, and then try removingthe frame from around the belief picture, so that you can seemore of the surrounding background. . . .Lou: When I do that, the picture automatically gets smaller,and it's less impressive.OK. So the frame brings size along with it, and has moreimpact than size alone. Change it back to the way it was originally,and then change the focus of that belief picture so that it becomesfuzzy. . . ,Lou: That doesn't change it much.Change that belief picture back again, and then make itdimmer. . . .Lou: When I do that it starts flashing on and off, a little bitlike doubt does.So changing the brightness also alters the flashing.

I feel all kind of floaty, and I can feel myheart speed up. When I start to change the position, all the otherthings start changing, too. It gets smaller and dimmer and out offocus; the frame fades away and it starts to flash on and off.OK. Move that picture back to straight ahead of you. Thelocation of the picture changes all other elements, so that is thesubmodality that is most powerful for Lou in moving somethingfrom belief to doubt. But before we do that, we need to havesomething else to put in its place. Lou, do you know what beliefyou would like to have in place of the belief you now have?Lou: Well, I never really thought about that in detail."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"106 Using Your BrainStart thinking about it now, and be sure you think about itin positive terms, not in terms of negations. Think of what youdo want to believe, not what you don't want to believe.I also want you to frame that belief not in terms of an endor goal, but in terms of a process or ability that would result inyour getting that goal. For instance, if you'd like to believe thatyou know NLP, change it so that you believe you can pay atten-tion, and learn and respond to feedback in order to learn NLP.Lou: OK. I know what I'd like to believe.This new belief is stated in positive terms, without negations,and it has to do with a process leading to a goal rather than thegoal itself, right? . . .Lou: Yes.Good. Now I want you to do what we call an ecology check.I want you to take a little time to imagine how you would actdifferently if you already had this new belief, and think of anyways in which this change could be a problem for you, or thepeople who are close to you, or the people you work with. . . .Lou: I can't think of any way that it could be a problem.Good. We'll call that the \"new belief.\" Set it aside for amoment.Now I want you to take that big picture of the belief youdon't like and move it all the way over to where your doubt is.As you do that, the picture will lose its frame and get dimmer,smaller, fuzzier, and start flashing. . . .Lou: OK. It's over here now, and it looks just like that otherdoubt picture.Good. When it flashes off, have that picture of the old beliefdisappear, and then have the picture of the new belief flash backon. ...Lou: OK. The new belief is flashing there now.Now take that picture of the new belief and move it back tothe center of your visual field. As it does this, notice how itdevelops a frame and gets bigger, brighter, sharper, and morevivid. . . .Lou: This is incredible! It's right there where the old beliefwas. I feel like my whole body just got out of prison, and I canfeel my cheeks are flushed."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Beyond Belief 107Right There are a lot of other nice changes going on, too.You can take a minute or two to let those changes settle in, whileI respond to a question or two.Man: Why can't you just take the picture of the desired beliefand change it to make it into a belief-the way we made confusioninto understanding?When you made confusion into understanding, there wasn' tany other understanding already there to get in the way. You caneven have several understandings of the same content withouttheir necessarily conflicting with each other. A belief tends to bemuch more universal and categorical than an understanding. Whenyou already have a belief, there's no room for a new one unlessyou weaken the old belief first. Typically the new belief is theopposite of the old belief, or at least very different in some way.Have you ever tried to convince someone of something that isthe opposite of what he already believes? Usually the existingbelief will prevent him from even considering the new belief. Thestronger the belief, the more that will be trueThink of it this way. Let's say a person believes X is good,and you succeeded in installing a new belief \"X is bad\" withoutchanging the old belief. What would you create? . . . What islikely to happen if someone fervently believes in two opposingideas? One way to deal with that situation is to become amultiple personality. One belief organizes the person in one wayfor a while- then the other belief takes over and reorganizes theperson in a very different way. That's not what I consider a veryevolutionary change.Woman- I want to ask about the \"floaty\" feeling that Loureported when you first tried changing the position of the beliefWell, that kind of response tells me two things. One is thatI've discovered a submodality change that really makes a profounddifference in her experience. The other thing it tells me is thatshe doesn't yet have a new belief to put in its place. Have youever had an experience that shattered an old belief, but you didn'thave a new belief to put in its place? Some people drift in a hazefor days before they can reorganize. That often happens to aperson when she gets fired from a job, or a friend or relative"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"108 Using Your Braindies. I once talked to a man whose college philosophy professorshattered a major belief of his. He said he dropped out and wentaround in a fog for over six months. I want to have a new beliefall \"waiting in the wings\" before I permanently weaken the oldbelief.Now let's come back to Lou, and do a little testing. Lou, isthat new belief still there?Lou: (She looks straight ahead and defocuses her eyes.) Yes.I keep checking to make sure. I have a hard time believing thatit could be so easy to do.What happens when you think of the old belief?Lou: (She looks up to her left, and then smiles.) It lookskind of dried up now.It's certainly not where it used to be. This is another way ofchecking what I've done, and of course I pay more attention toher nonverbal cues that to her words. Now we have a five-minutefollow-up. (For information about a videotaped demonstration ofthis Belief Change Pattern, see Appendix IV.)I want you all to try out this pattern in groups of three. Oneof you will be programmer, one will be client, and one will bean observer/consultant. I'll review all the steps again for youbefore you begin.Belief Change PatternA. Information gathering and preparation1. Belief: \"Think of a belief you have about yourself thatyou wish you didn't have, because it limits you in some way, orhas undesirable consequences. How do you represent this beliefin your internal experience?\"2. Doubt: \"Now think of something that you doubt. It mightbe true or might not be: you're not sure. How do you representthis doubt in your internal experience?\"When you ask your partner to think of something she doubts,make sure it's something she's unsure of. If she says somethinglike, \"I doubt that's a good idea,\" what she may really mean isthat she believes it's not a good idea. Doubt is when you waver"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Beyond Belief 109from thinking something might be true to thinking it might notbe true; you just don't know.3. Differences: Do a contrastive analysis to find and list thesubmodality differences between Belief and Doubt, just as youdid before with confusion and understanding.4. Testing: Test each submodality on your list of differencesone at a time to find out which ones are the most powerful inchanging belief to doubt. After testing one submodality, changeit back to the way it was originally before testing the next one.5. New Belief: \"What new belief would you like to have inplace of the belief that you now have and don't like?\" Be surethis belief is stated in positive terms, without negations. \"I canlearn to change in response to feedback,\" rather than \"I won't beunable to change what I do.\"Also be sure that your partner thinks of the new belief interms of an ability or a process, rather than having alreadyachieved a desired goal. \"I believe that I can learn to change andmaintain my weight\" is a useful belief. \"I weigh 107 pounds\" isnot a very useful belief, especially if she actually weighs 350pounds! We want to mobilize new abilities, not install new delu-sions.You also need to ask the person to check for ecology: \"Ifyou have this new belief, how could it cause you problems?\"\"How will your husband or your family respond to you differentlyif you have this new belief?\" \"How will this new belief affectyour work?\" etc. Modify the new belief to take into account anypossible difficulties.Your partner doesn't have to tell you what the new belief is.All you need is a word to identify this new content.B. Belief Change Process6. Belief to Doubt: Keeping the content the same, changethe unwanted belief to doubt by using one or more of the mostpowerful submodalities you discovered in step 4. For instance, ifthe two most powerful differences were movie to slide, and closepanorama to distant framed picture, have the panoramic movieslow to a still slide as it moves away and becomes a framedpicture."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"110 Using Your Brain1. Change Content: Using some other submodality, changethe content from the old unwanted belief to the new desiredbelief. Use something she already does, or any gradual analoguemethod. For example, if she flips pictures back and forth in doubt,she can flip from the old content to the new content. You couldhave the old belief picture go off into the distance so far that it'simpossible to tell what it is, then have it come back with the newbelief image. You can have the picture get so bright or so dimthat the old content disappears, and then have it come back withthe new content, etc.8. Doubt to Belief: Keeping the new content, change doubtto belief by reversing the same submodality changes you used inStep 6. If shifting location to the right changed the old belief todoubt, you now shift location back to the left to change the newcontent from doubt to belief. As you do this, be very alert forany \"resistance,\" or difficulty that your partner has. If the newbelief is stated poorly, or has any negations in it, some part ofthe person may object to it. When you encounter objections,honor them, gather information, and back up to step 5 to redefinethe new belief.C. Testing9. There are several ways to test. You can ask \"How do youthink about this new belief?\" Ask for information about submo-dalites, and use nonverbal behavior to confirm (or disconfirm)the verbal report.10. When the new belief is in place, the old belief willprobably change to the submodalities of disbelief. If you find outhow the old belief is represented now, you can compare that withthe submodalities of doubt, which you already know, or with thesubmodalities of disbelief, which you can find out by asking theperson to think of something else she firmly disbelieves.I've often said that good NLP work is 95% information-gathering and 5% intervention. The first five steps are settingthings up for the intervention. That makes it easy to make theactual intervention smooth and fast. Remember, brains learn"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Beyond Belief 111quickly; they don't learn slowly. If you get it all set up ahead oftime, it's a lot easier to do a good job. It's a little like setting upa whole string of dominoes, and then tapping the first one.Go ahead and try this pattern now, in groups of three. Iknow some of you have questions; many of those questions willbe answered by the exercise itself. The questions you still havelater will be a lot more interesting after you have had someexperience of actually trying out this pattern. My answers willmake a lot more sense to you, too.Now that you've had some experience trying this, let's takesome questions and comments.Man: When I made the belief change, I had a lot of profoundinternal sensations. It felt as if there were a lot of little fishswimming around in my brain and my body, and the two peopleobserving saw a lot of visible shifts, too. Is this typical?When the belief is a major one, that's a typical report. Corebeliefs organize a lot of a person's behavior. When you make achange in a core belief, you often get a profound internal reor-ganization. If it's a more peripheral belief, the changes aren't asstriking.Man: I found it hard to think of a useful belief to change.I'd like to hear some content examples of what people changed.Woman: I've been struggling and struggling for years to lose"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"112 Using Your Brainthe last five pounds to get to the weight I want to be. It's easyfor me to get close to the weight I want to be, but I've alwaysbelieved I had to struggle and fight to control myself in order tolose that last five pounds. So I changed my belief that it washard, to the belief that it will be easy to lose those last fivepounds. What a relief; I feel so much more relaxed,Man: I worked with her on that, and it was really nice towatch her go through the change. Her face, her voice, her wholebody—everything was a lot more relaxed afterwards.Woman: I've had a runny nose and I changed the belief thatI couldn't do anything about it. I was amazed, because I canactually feel my nose beginning to dry up.Man: I started with the belief that it was dangerous for meto drive at night without my glasses. I wanted to change it to thebelief that I could safely drive without my glasses at night. Thenmy partner pointed out that my desired belief was a goal, andthat it might be dangerous to change to that belief, I might godriving at night thinking I was safe when I wasn't. So we changedto the belief that I can learn to drive safely at night withoutglasses. I think I was really working on a much more generalbelief that I couldn't learn, period. I have a sense that this willaffect much more than just driving at night; it seems much broaderthan that.Great. Changing the belief that you can't learn something isuseful for a lot of people. Many people try something once, don'tsucceed at it, and conclude they can't do it and they can't learnto do it. I know a man who \"knew\" he couldn't play the piano:\"I sat down at the piano and tried it once, but nothing came ofit.\" I start off with the belief that as long as you have most ofyour brain cells intact, anyone can do anything. You may needto chunk down the task, or learn to do it differently, and it maytake you a while to get good at it, but starting with the beliefthat you can learn will take you a long way. My belief may evenbe wrong sometimes, but it makes it possible for me to do thingsand get results that I would never even consider if I assumedpeople were genetically incapable.Man: Several people are using firewalking as a way to changepeople's limiting beliefs. Can you comment on that?"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Beyond Belief 113If someone believes they can't do something like firewalkingand you get them to discover that it's possible, that can certainlyshatter an old belief, particularly if they're told, \"If you can walkon fire, you can do anything!\" However, there's no way to care-fully specify the new belief that gets put in its place. I read aboutone person who went through a firewalk and said, \"Now I believethat I could be standing right at the explosion of a nuclearwarhead, and it wouldn't affect me.\" If he's lucky, he won't everget to test that belief, but it's an example of the kind of junkybeliefs that can get installed that way. If you install beliefs thatway, people often put in beliefs that don't relate to evidence orfeedback. One firewalk teacher is calling himself \"the foremostNLP trainer,\" when he hasn't even been certified as a masterpractitioner, much less a trainer! Some of his other beliefs haveeven less evidence for them.I know that some people have gotten some very useful beliefchanges from doing the firewalk. Even a stopped clock is righttwice a day. The problem with firewalking is that you have littlecontrol over the new belief that takes the place of the old one.There are enough bizarre and dangerous beliefs in the worldwithout adding to them with a random process.Another problem with something like firewalking is that ittends to install the belief that it takes a really dramatic externalevent to get you to change. I'd rather install the belief that changehappens constantly, and easily, and making it work for you is amatter of understanding how to run your own brain. It doesn'ttake walking on hot coals to do that.There is a completely separate issue of whether firewalkingis actually something that's difficult to do or not, and whether thesix hours of evangelistic preparation makes any difference in beingable to walk on the coals. A reporter from the Rolling Stonetimed people as they walked across and found a range of 1.5seconds to 1.9 seconds, with an average of about 1.7 seconds.The length of the walk was about 10 feet, so if you have a 30\"stride you can easily make it across in 4 steps—two on each foot.That gives a maximum of less than half a second of actual contactper footstep. Firewalkers make a big deal about the temperatureof the coals—1,400 to 2,000 degrees—but they don't mention that"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"114 Using Your Braineach foot has only two contacts with the coals lasting less thanhalf a second each. When you pick up a hot coal that's landedon your carpet to throw it back into the fireplace, your fingersprobably contact the coal for about that long—and your fingertipsare much more sensitive than your feet.Burning requires heat transfer, not just temperature, and thecontact time is only one factor in heat transfer. Another factor isconductivity. Let's say you're in a cabin in the mountains and youget out of bed in the morning when it's 20 degrees below zero,and one bare foot lands on a steel plate, while the other landson a sheepskin rug. Even though the rug and the steel are bothat 20 degrees below, the steel will feel a lot colder than the rug,because of it's greater heat conductivity. The conductivity of char-coal is greater than sheepskin, but a lot less than steel. Ask thenext firewalker you meet if he's willing to walk the same lengthon a steel plate that's at the same temperature as those coals!There is an additional factor that physicists call the \"Leiden-frost effect.\" When there is a significant temperature differencebetween two substances, and the cooler one is a liquid or containsliquid, a thin vapor layer forms to create an insulating barrierthat reduces heat transfer significantly.All the evidence I have indicates that a ten foot, 1.5 secondfirewalk is something' anyone can do, with or without evangelisticpreparation, but very few people think they can do.Woman: Some people have beliefs that don't seem to influ-ence their behavior much. For instance, I have a boss who alwaystalks about how people should be nice to each other, but he'susually mean to people himself. How do you explain that?I try to understand how things work, not \"explain\" them.There are several possibilities. One is that this belief is not reallysomething he believes, even though he talks about it. A lot of\"intellectuals\" have beliefs like that which have no effect on theirbehavior. In that case you could use the belief change pattern tomake his belief into one that is subjectively real enough to affecthis behavior.Another possibility is that his belief is real enough, but it'sselective: other people should be nice to him, but he doesn't needto be nice to them, because he's special. Kings, dictators, and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Beyond Belief 115some movie stars are like that. Beliefs aren't always reciprocal.A third possibility is that your boss' belief is real, and recip-rocal, but what he thinks of as \"being nice\" seems \"mean\" toyou. In the 60's a lot of humanistic psychologists would hugeveryone too hard because they believed it was a nice thing todo, without noticing whether the \"huggee\" liked it or not. They'dalso go around insulting people, because they thought it wasalways good to be honest and tell the truth. The crusaders believedthat saving souls was an important thing to do, and they didn'tcare if it was sometimes necessary to kill the body in order to doit.The process of changing a belief is relatively easy, as long asyou have the person's consent. It's a little tougher if the persondoesn't want to change a belief. I've also presupposed that youcan identify a belief that's worth changing. Sometimes that's notobvious, and it may take some work to determine what someone'slimiting belief is. Often the belief that the person wants to changeisn't the one that actually limits his behavior.My principal goal here is to teach you a. process that you canuse to change a belief. However, the content that you put into abelief is also important. That's why I asked you to be sure to doan ecology check, as well as to state the new belief in terms of aprocess, rather than a goal, and to state it in positive terms. Iasked you to do this belief change process without knowing thecontent of the new belief, because I know that some of you wouldget lost in the content and have trouble learning the process.After you have learned the process thoroughly, you won't be aslikely to get lost in the content. When you're working with yourclients, it's a good idea to know something about the content, sothat you can verify that the new belief is stated in positive terms,is a process rather than a goal, and that it's likely to be ecological.Beliefs are very powerful things; when you change one it can doa lot of good, but if you install the wrong one, it can do a lot ofharm, too. I want you to be very careful about the kinds of newbeliefs you go around installing in people."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"VIIILearningI have always thought it was interesting that when people arearguing about a point that doesn't matter, they say \"It's academic.\"John Grinder and I were forced to leave teaching at the Universityof California because we were teaching undergraduates to dothings in their lives. That was the complaint against us. They saidschool was only for teaching people about things.When I was an undergraduate, the only courses I did badlyin were psychology and public speaking. I flunked psychology 1A,and I got a \"D\" in public speaking! How's that for a joke? NLPis my revenge.In my contacts with educators, I've noticed that the peoplewho teach a subject may be very good at it, and know a tot aboutthat particular area. However, they usually know very little abouthow they learned it, and even less about how to teach it tosomeone else. I went to a lecture in a beginning chemistry classonce. The professor walked up in front of 350 people and said,\"Now I want you to imagine a mirror here, and in front of themirror is a DNA helix molecule, rotating backwards.\" Some peo-ple in the room were going \"Ahhh!\" They became chemists. Somepeople in the room were going \"Huh?\" They did not becomechemists. Some people in the room were going \"Urghh!\" Theybecame therapists!That professor had no idea that most people can't visualizein the detailed way that he did. That kind of visualization is a117"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"118 Using Your Brainprerequisite for a successful career in chemistry, and it is a skillthat can be taught to people who don't yet know how to visualizewell. But since that professor presupposed that everyone elsecould already do what he did, he was wasting his time with mostof the people in his classes.Most studies of the learning process have been \"objective.\"What NLP does is to explore the subjective experience of theprocesses by which people learn things. \"Objective\" studies usu-ally study people who have the problem; NLP studies the subjec-tive experience of people who have the solution. If you studydyslexia, you'll learn a lot about dyslexia. But if you want toteach kids how to read, it makes sense to study people who canread well.When we made up the name \"Neuro-Linguistic Program-ming,\" a lot of people said, \"It sounds like 'mind control,' \" as ifthat were something bad. I said \"Yes, of course.\" If you don'tbegin to control and use your own brain, then you have to justleave it to chance. That is sort of what our educational system islike. They keep the content in front of you for twelve years; ifyou learn it, then they taught it to you. There are a lot of waysthat the existing educational system is failing, and I'd like todiscuss several of them.\"School phobias \"One of the most pervasive problems is that a lot of kids havealready had bad experiences in school. Because of this, a certainsubject, or school in general, becomes a cue that triggers badmemories that make a kid feel bad. And in case you haven'tnoticed, people don't learn very much when they're feeling bad.If a kid's response is really strong, psychologists even describe itas a \"school phobia.\" Feeling bad in response to school situationscan be changed rapidly by using a number of the techniques we'vedescribed and demonstrated earlier, but I'd like to show youanother very simple way to do it.How many of you have bad feelings about mathematics—fractions, square roots, quadratic equations and stuff like that?(He writes a long string of equations on the board and a numberof people groan or sigh.)"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Learning 119Now close your eyes and think of an experience you had thatwas absolutely marvelous—some situation in which you felt excitedand curious. . . .Now open your eyes for a second or two to look at theseequations, and then close your eyes and return to that marvelousexperience. . . .Now open your eyes to look at the equations for severalseconds more, and then return to your exciting experience again.Alternate a few more times until those two experiences are thor-oughly integrated. . . .Now it's time to test. First look away and think of anyexperience that's neutral for you, . . . and then look up here atthe equations, and notice your response-Man: My God, it works!This is actually an old NLP method we call \"integratinganchors.\" If you want to know more about that, you can readFrogs into Princes. Changing most bad responses to school canbe done that easily and quickly, but you have to know how thebrain works to be able to do it. (If you want to try this methodyourself, you will find a page of equations in Appendix VI.)A more imaginative way to use the same principle is to alwaysconnect learning with fun and enjoyment to start with. In mostschools they have the kids all lined up sitting still in neat, silentrows. I always ask, \"How long until the kids get to laugh, move,and enjoy themselves?\" If you connect boredom and discomfortwith learning, it's no wonder nobody wants to do it. One of thegreat things about computer-assisted education is that computersare more fun to be with than most teachers. Computers haveinfinite patience, and never make kids feel bad the way a lot ofteachers do.RememberingAnother major problem for many kids is remembering thestuff they learn in school. A lot of what is called education issimply memorizing. This is changing somewhat. Teachers are start-ing to realize that the amount of information is so huge, expandingso rapidly, and changing so fast, that memorization isn't nearly as"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"120 Using Your Brainimportant as they used to think. It's much more important nowto be able to find the facts when you need them, use them, andforget them. However, you do have to be able to remember howto do that.One aspect of memory is similar to what we just discussed:Is the memory paired with a pleasant or unpleasant experience?In order for someone to remember something, he has to go backinto the state of consciousness in which the information wasprovided. That's how memory works. If you make someone angryor unhappy when you ask him to do something, in order toremember it he has to get back into that state. Since he doesn'twant to feel bad, he is not likely to remember it. This is whymost of us have total amnesia for 12 or 16 years of education. Ican't even remember teachers' names let alone most of what Iwas taught or any of the events. But I can remember the last dayof school!What's your name?Woman: Lydia.You forgot your name tag.1 The only way I can remembernames is to hallucinate name tags on people. Every time I meetpeople I keep looking at their left breast; people think I'm apervert now. I taught for Xerox once and since everybody hadXerox labels on, I kept calling people \"Xerox\" all day. It's oneof those things; your brain learns to do it, and once it realizesit's of no value it continues anyway.Lydia, if you forget your name tag, I'll think that you aresneaking into this seminar, and I'll install certain suggestions . . .that will stay with you for the rest of your life. If you have aname tag, I don't do that. You only get suggestions that stay withyou for a short period of time.Lydia, I'm going to tell you a number: 357. Now I want youto forget the number I just told you. . . . Have you forgotten ityet? (No.) If you can't forget one number when a number has nomeaning, how could you forget your name tag, or importantcontent in a seminar? Have you forgotten it yet? (No.) Now, howis it possible that you can't forget something that has no impor-tance?Lydia; If we keep talking about it, I'll remember it even"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Learning 121more. It doesn't matter if it is important or not. Especially sinceyou are asking me to forget it, I won't forget it.That makes sense. . . . Did you see how many people noddedwhen you said that? \"Oh yeah, you asked me to forget it, so Ihave to remember it. After all, it has no importance but we aretalking about it. If you ask me to forget something that has beentalked about for a long time that isn't important, I have toremember it.\" It's bizarre, isn't it? ... But she is right.It sounds weird, but even though it sounds weird, you knowshe's right. Her saying that is as weird as her doing it. Yetpsychologists will ignore that as if it has no significance, and goon to study things like \"oedipal complexes\" and many otherstrange things. Psychologists will pass up studying how peopleremember things in favor of studying what \"depth\" of trance youhave been in—that's the metaphor where trance is a hole thatyou fall into, and going deeper is of great value. The people whotalk about \"levels of consciousness\" disagree; they think it's betterto go higher, not deeper.If I didn't talk about it very long, and talked about it in justthe right way, she could forget a number with only three digits.Lydia can forget her name tag, even though people told her itwas important. Many of you try to get people to remember things.How many of you talk to people about things that are important,yet they forget what you said? And you thought it was their fault!Remember that when you want someone else to remember some-thing.Except for torturing rats, probably more psychologists' timehas gone into studying memory than any other subject. However,they've never really gotten at how people do it in terms ofsubjective experience.How many of you have trouble remembering telephone num-bers? Most of you probably try to do it auditorily, by verballyrepeating the numbers to yourself. Many of you were taught themultiplication tables by auditory recitation. Even when that issuccessful, it's very slow, because you have to recite all thosewords inside to get to the answer. \"Nine, seven, three . . . zero,four, six, eight\"; \"Nine times six is fifty-four.\" For a lot of infor-mation it's much more efficient to memorize it visually instead of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"122 Using Your Brainauditorily: 973-0468, 9 x 6 = 54. When you remember visually,the entire picture pops into your mind at once, and you just skipto the information you need, and read it or copy it down. A lotof kids who are considered \"slow learners\" are simply remember-ing auditorily instead of visually. When you take an hour or twoto teach them how to do it visually, they learn much more rapidly.On the other hand, some people try to remember music bymaking pictures or having feelings, instead of hearing the sounds.So it's always a matter of remembering in a way that's appropriateto what you want to remember.Another good way to have a bad memory is to do somethingtotally irrelevant to memorizing the data. If you repeat to yourself,\"I've got to remember the phone number,\" then what you willremember is that sentence, rather than the phone number! A lotof people do something like that, and then wonder why they havesuch \"bad memories.\" Actually their memories are excellent;they're just using them to remember idiotic things.If you study people who have phenomenal memories, youfind out that they do some really interesting things. One manwith an excellent memory puts subtitles under all his pictures. Heactually prints words on his pictures that describe what the picturesare about. That short verbal description codes and categorizes thememory, so that it's easy to go back to it. It's like putting a titleon a movie, so you can glance at the title and know what it'sabout without having to watch the entire movie. In the computerbusiness we call that a \"drop tag code\"—something that is arbi-trary but distinctive, that relates to this and also relates to that,linking them together.We had a woman in a seminar once who was rapidly intro-duced to forty-five people by first and last name. That's all ittook for her to know everyone's name. I've seen Harry Loraynedo the same thing with about three hundred people on a TVshow. When this woman was introduced to someone, she wouldfocus on something very distinctive in what she saw—the shapeof the nose, skin coloring, chin, or whatever she spontaneouslynoticed that was unique about that person. She would continueto focus on this distinctive feature as she heard the person's name,and that would connect the two together. She even checked herself"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Learning 123quickly by looking away briefly to visualize that unique feature,and listen for the name, to make sure the connection had beenmade. I like to have people wear name tags, so I don't have tobother to do that. However, it certainly is a useful talent thatcould be taught to salespeople. They often have to deal with manypeople, and it's considered important to remember their namesand be personally friendly with them.If you deal with people mostly over the telephone, this visualmethod won't work. However, you can easily adapt it to theauditory system: notice something distinctive about the person'svoice tone or tempo as you hear the name, and hear the namespoken with that distinctive feature. Very visual people mightprefer to imagine the name visually as they hear it. You canalways adapt a memory strategy in this way, to make it appropriateto the context or the skills of the person who wants to recallsomething.If you really want to remember a name, pair it with somethingunique in all three major representational systems: auditory, vis-ual, and kinesthetic. While you listen to the sound of the name,spoken in his voice tone, you could notice something unique inwhat you see as you look at him, and also what you feel as youshake hands. Since that gives you a drop tag code in each majorsystem, you will have three different ways to recall the name.Another way to have a \"good memory\" is to be as efficientand economical as possible in what you do remember, and to usewhat you have already remembered as much as possible. Forinstance, if you always put your keys in the right front pocket ofyour pants, you only have to remember that once. Someone whoputs her keys in many different places may have to remember itfour or five times each day, instead of once in a lifetime.One of our students has a couple of businesses and has tofile a lot of papers and records. Whenever something has to befiled, he asks himself, \"Where would I look for this when I needit,\" and starts moving toward the file cabinet. As he does this,an image of a particular file tab appears in his mind, and he filesit there. This method uses what he has already remembered toorganize his files, so he seldom has to remember anything new.Each time he files this item he strengthens the existing connection"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"124 Using Your Brainbetween it and the file tab, making the system more dependableeach time.One way of thinking about these two examples is that theycreate a situation in which you have to remember as little aspossible. Here's another example. Take a look at the set of num-bers below for a few moments, and then look away and see howmuch of it you can remember. . . .149162536496481100Now look at it long enough so that you can still rememberit when you look away. . . .If you have actually tried this, you probably started to groupthe numbers into twos or threes to organize the task and makeremembering easier:14,91,62,53,64,96,48,11,00or149,162,536,496,481,100This is a process we call \"chunking\": breaking a large taskdown into smaller, more manageable, pieces. In business there'san old joke, \"How do you eat an elephant?\" The answer is, \"Onebite at a time.\"At this point, how long do you think you could rememberthis number accurately?—an hour?—a day?—a week?Now let's chunk the number a little differently. Does thissuggest anything to you?1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100We can write this same set of numbers a little differently, assquares of numbers: 12 22 32 42 52 62 72 82 92 102Now it's obvious that the number we started with is thesquares of the numbers 1 through 10, strung together. Knowingthis, you can easily remember this number ten or twenty yearsfrom now. What makes it so easy?

This is what math and science is all about—coding"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Learning 125the world efficiently and elegantly, so that you have fewer thingsto remember, leaving your brain free to do other things that aremore fun and interesting.Those are just a few of the principles that can make remem-bering a lot easier and faster. Unfortunately they're not yet usedmuch in mainstream education.\"Learning Disabilities \"One of the nice things that happens after you write enoughbooks is that people let you do things that you wanted to dobefore, but couldn't. Typically by that time you can't quite re-member what they were, but I had written some of them down.When I was asked to work for a school district, I had a few thingsI wanted to go after. One of them is the whole notion of \"learningdisabilities,\" \"minimal brain dysfunction,\" \"dyslexia,\" or \"educa-tional handicaps.\" Those are very important-sounding words, butwhat they all describe is that the teaching isn't working.Whenever a kid isn't learning, experts are quick to concludethat the problem is a \"learning disability,\" ... but they're neverquite clear about who has it! Perhaps you've noticed that theynever call it a \"teaching disability.\" The implication is always thatthe cause of the failure is that the kid's brain is weak or damaged,often by presumed genetic causes. When people don't know howto change something, they often start searching for a way tojustify failure, rather than thinking about how they could trydoing something different to make it work. If you assume that akid has a limp learning lobe, then there's nothing you can doabout it until they perfect brain grafts.I'd rather not explain failure that way. I'd rather think aboutit as a \"teaching dysfunction,\" and at least leave open the possi-bility that we can learn to change it. If we pretend that you canteach anyone anything, we'll find out where it's not (yet) true.But if we think that when someone isn't learning it means theycan't be taught, no one will even try.In the last century it was common knowledge that mancouldn't fly. Then when airplanes became a part of everyday life,most people didn't think it was possible to put a man on the"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"126 Using Your Brainmoon. If you take the attitude that anything is possible, you'llfind that a lot of things that were previously thought impossibleactually do become possible.The whole idea of \"learning disabilities\" is based primarilyon old neurological \"ablation\" studies that resulted from a fairlyprimitive idea of how the brain works: that you can figure outwhat something does by noticing what happens when it's broken.They would find damage in one part of the brain of someonewho couldn't talk, and say, \"That's where speech is.\" That is thesame logic as cutting a wire in a television set, noticing that thepicture tilts, and saying, \"That wire is where the picture straight-ness is.\" There are thousands of wires, connections, and transistorsinvolved in holding the picture straight, in a very complex andinterdependent system, and the brain is a lot more complex thana TV set. For some of the more primitive areas of the brain thereactually is a certain degree of localization of function. However,it's also been known for years that a young child can lose anentire cerebral hemisphere and learn everything all over againperfectly on the other side.Recent evidence is throwing out a lot of old neurologicaldogma. In an X-Ray Tomography study they found a collegegraduate with an 10 of 120 who had such enlarged brain ventriclesthat his cortex was only about a centimeter thick! Most of hisskull was filled with fluid, and according to dogma, he shouldn'thave been able to get up in the morning, let alone go to college!Another old dogma is that in vertebrates no new neurons areformed after birth. Last year they found that the number ofneurons in the part of a male canary's brain devoted to singingdoubles each spring, and then half of them die off during the restof the year.In another study they found that if you remove a monkey'sfinger, the part of the brain that used to serve the missing fingergets used by the neighboring fingers within a few weeks, and thismakes the remaining fingers more sensitive than before. All recentinformation points to the brain being much more flexible andadaptive than we used to think it was.I never liked the idea of children being \"educationally hand-icapped,\" because I never thought that reading was primarily"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Learning 127genetic. A child can learn to talk in three years, even in thejungle without Ph.D. parents! Why should it take ten more yearsto teach him to read the same thing he already knows how tosay? Kids in ghettos can learn three languages at once, and theycan learn to write all kinds of things in secret codes. But the waythings are taught in schools produces a situation in which somekids aren't learning to read. Some of you may remember classeswhere you didn't learn much because of the atrocious way thematerial was presented.Learning to read is really not that difficult. All you have todo is connect the picture of the word with the sound of the wordthat you already know. If you know the spoken word, you havealready connected that sound with an experience of what thatword means. When you were a child, you probably learned prettyearly that the sound \"cat\" meant a soft furry little moving thingwith claws that meows. The way you do that in your brain is tohear the word \"cat\" at the same time that you recall your expe-rience of the sight, sound, and feeling of a cat. Then if someonesays the word, that experience is there in your mind, and if yousee, hear, or feel a cat, the sound of the word is there. All readingdoes is to add a picture of the word into what you already know.When you see the word \"dog,\" you get a different sound andpicture in your mind than when you see the word \"cat.\"Now that seems pretty simple, and it is. Yet there is anenormous amount of claptrap written about reading problems,and a huge amount of effort goes into trying to solve readingproblems. In contrast, there is an NLP-trained group in Denver(see Appendix V) that works with all kinds of educational prob-lems. They will guarantee to raise a kid's reading level, as mea-sured by standard tests, by a minimum of one grade level in aset of eight one-hour sessions. Usually they can make much moreprogress in a shorter time. In the last three years they have onlyhad to pay off on their guarantee once. Their only prerequisite isthat the kid has muscular stability in using his eyes, so he cansee what he's trying to read.DrugsOne of the other things I wanted to go after in the school"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"128 Using Your Brainsystem is the widespread practice of prescribing drugs like Ritalinfor \"hyperactive\" kids who have trouble sitting quietly in rowsfor long periods of time, Ritalin slows them down so the teachercan keep up with them. Giving these kids drugs is always defendedby saying that the drugs are harmless. One of the interestingthings about Ritalin is that although it slows down hyperactivekids, its effect on adults is more like an amphetamine: it speedsthem up.So when I talked to this school district I said, \"This Ritalinthat you're giving the kids slows them down, but it speeds upadults, right? And you're all convinced that it's perfectly safe,and has no harmful side effects, right? Good. I have a proposalthat will save you a lot of money. Stop giving it to the kids, andgive it to the teachers, so that they can speed up and keep upwith the kids.\" They were boxed in with their own logic, but theystill didn't like it. Try suggesting that at your school and find outhow many of those \"learning disabled teachers\" are willing totake a \"perfectly harmless drug.\" The same thing happens withpsychiatrists; they almost never prescribe psychoactive drugs forother psychiatrists when they're hospitalized! After thirty years ofprescribing phenothiazine drugs, now they've found it causessomething called \"Tardive Dyskinesia\" later in life. It affects yourmuscles so you shake all over and have trouble walking or pickingup a teacup.Woman: I'm a teacher, and just last week I was in a staffconference with a diagnostician, a nurse, and another teacher.The nurse said, \"I think we should prescribe drugs for this kid,\"and the others nodded their heads. I got really angry, and said,\"I can't believe that with all the focus on drug abuse you'rerecommending that this kid take drugs! How would you like totake drugs?\" The diagnostician said, \"I take drugs every night tocalm down.\" And the other teacher said, \"So do I.\" And thenurse said, \"I take Valium every day.\" I couldn't believe it, andI was so shocked I didn't know what to say.Well, taking drugs yourself is a lot different than forcing themon someone else. I think people should choose their own drugs.What's really sad is that most of the problems people are pre-scribing drugs for can be changed so easily using NLP. Any NLP"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Learning 129practitioner should be able to fix a school phobia in half an hour,and most bad spellers can be made into good spellers in an houror two.However, you have to be a little careful now.

There are even a few people claiming tobe \"the foremost NLP trainer\" who have only gone through onetraining! That's the kind of thing that happens whenever some-thing effective starts to get known, so be a little cautious and aska few questions of anybody who claims to be trained in NLP.Some good NLP people are going back into special educationclasses and wantonly wiping out all kinds of learning problemsright and left. When you know how to find out how someone'sbrain works, it's relatively easy to teach him how to use it in away that's more effective and efficient.The capacity for learning is really actualized not when some-body inundates you with the content, but when someone can teachyou the mechanism by which it can be done: the subjectivestructures and sequences that are necessary for learning."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"IXThe SwishThe next submodality pattern I want to teach you can beused for almost anything. It's a very generative pattern that pro-grams your brain to go in a new direction. In order to make thepattern easy for you to learn, I'm going to start with somethingreally simple and easy. A lot of people are interested in somethingcalled \"habit control.\" Who in here bites his nails and would likenot to? (Jack steps up to the platform.) I'm going to use thispattern to get Jack to do something else instead of bite his nails.What do you see just before you bite your nails?Jack: I don't know. I don't usually realize I'm doing it untilI've done it for a while.That's true of most habits. You're on \"automatic pilot,\" andlater on, when it's too late to do anything about it, you notice itand feel bad. Do you know when or where you typically biteyour nails?Jack: It's usually when I'm reading a book or watching amovie.OK. I want you to imagine that you're watching a movie,and actually bring one of your hands up as if you were going tobite your nails. I want you to notice what you see as your handcomes up, knowing that you're about to bite your nails.Jack: OK. I can see what my hand looks like as it comes up.Good. We'll use that picture in a few minutes, but just set itaside for now. We need to get another picture first. Jack, if you131"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"132 Using Your Brainno longer bit your nails, how would you see yourself as beingdifferent? I don't mean just that you would see yourself withlonger fingernails. What would be the value of changing thishabit? What difference would it make to you as a person? Whatwould it mean about you? I don't want you to tell me the answers;I want you to answer by creating a picture of the you that youwould be if you no longer had this habit.Jack: OK. I've got it.Now I want you to get that first picture of your hand comingup, and make it big and bright, . . . and in the lower right cornerof that picture put a small, dark image of how you would seeyourself differently if you no longer had this habit. • . .Now I want you to do what I call \"the swish.\" I want you tomake the small dark image quickly get bigger and brighter untilit covers the old picture of your hand, which will simultaneouslyget dim and shrink. I want you to do this really fast, in less thana second. As soon as you've \"swished\" these images, either blankthe screen completely, or open your eyes and look around. Thengo back inside and do it again, starting with that big bright pictureof your hand coming up, and the small dark image of yourself inthe corner. Do it a total of five times. Be sure to blank the screenor open your eyes at the end each time you do it. ...Now it's time to test. Jack, make that big bright image ofyour hand coming up and tell me what happens. . . .Jack: Well, it's hard to hold it there. It fades out, and thatother picture comes in.The swish pattern directionalizes the brain. Human beingshave a tendency to avoid unpleasantness and move towards pleas-antness. First there is a big bright image of the cue for thebehavior that he doesn't like. As that picture fades and shrinks,the unpleasantness diminishes. As the pleasant image gets biggerand brighter, it draws him toward it. It literally sets up a directionfor his mind to go: \"from here, go there.\" When you directionalizeyour mind, your behavior has a very strong tendency to go in thesame direction.Jack, I want you to do something else. Bring your hand upto your mouth the way you did when you bit your nails, (Jack"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Swish 133brings his hand up. Just before it reaches his mouth, it stops andthen lowers about half an inch.)Well, what happened?Jack: I don't know. My hand came up, but then it stopped.I wanted to put my hand down, but I deliberately held it upthere, because you asked me to.This is a behaviorial test. The behavior that used to lead tonail-biting now leads somewhere else. It's just as automatic aswhat he did before, but it takes him somewhere he likes better.This will translate out into experience. As that hand comesup and that compulsion begins in you, the feeling itself willliterally pull you in the other direction. It will become a newcompulsion. It's not really that you get uncompulsed, it's that youget compulsed to be more of who you want to be.I did this pattern with a chocolate freak who kept saying shewanted to be \"free.\" She didn't want to be compulsed because itdidn't fit with the way she saw herself. After she was done, shecouldn't hold a picture of chocolates. It just went \"poof.\" Nowwhen she looks at real chocolate, she doesn't have the old re-sponse. The direction of her thoughts is toward being attractedto what she wants to be. It's a new compulsion. You could callthis pattern \"trade compulsions.\" I said to her, \"Now you're reallystuck. You're compulsed to not be able to make these pictures,\"and she said, \"I don't care.\" She doesn't really object to beingcompulsed; she just wants to be compulsed in her own way. That'sreally the difference that makes a difference.The swish pattern has a more powerful effect than any othertechnique I've used. In a recent seminar there was a woman inthe front row moaning and groaning about having tried to quitsmoking for eleven years. I changed her in less than eleven min-utes. I even chose what to put in the little dark corner picture;I'm not what people call a \"non-directive clinician.1 I told her tosee an image of herself politely enjoying other people smoking.I wasn't willing to create another evangelist convert. I didn't wanther to see herself sneering at smokers and making life miserablefor them.Now I want you all to pair up and try this pattern. First I'llgo through the instructions again."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"134 Using Your BrainThe Swish Pattern1. Identify context. \"First identify where you are broken orstuck. Where or when would you like to behave or responddifferently than you do now? You could pick something like nail-biting, or you might pick something like getting angry at yourhusband.\"2. Identify cue picture. \"Now I want you to identify what youactually see in that situation just before you start doing thebehavior you don't like. Since many people are on 'automaticpilot' at that time, it may help to actually do whatever has toprecede the behavior, so you can see what that looks like.\" Thisis what I did with Jack. I had him move his hand toward his faceand use that image. Since this is the cue for some response thatthe person doesn't like, there should be at least some unpleas-antness associated with this picture. The more unpleasant this is,the better it will work.3. Create outcome picture. \"Now create a second image ofhow you would see yourself differently if you had already accom-plished the desired change. I want you to keep adjusting this imageuntil you have one that is really attractive to you—one that drawsyou strongly.\" As your partner makes this image, I want you tonotice her response, to be sure it's something that she really likesand really attracts her. I want her to have a glow on her face thattells you that what she's picturing is really worth going for. If youcan't see evidence that it's worth going after as you watch her,don't give it to her.4. Swish. \"Now 'swish' these two pictures. Start with seeingthat cue picture, big and bright. Then put a small, dark image ofthe outcome picture in the lower right corner. The small darkimage will grow big and bright and cover the first picture, whichwill get dim and shrink away as fast as you can say 'swish.' Thenblank out the screen, or open your eyes. Swish it again a total offive times. Be sure to blank the screen at the end of each swish.\"5. Test.a. \"Now picture that first image. . . . What happens?\" Ifthe swish has been effective, this will be hard to do. The picturewill tend to fade away and be replaced by the second image ofyourself as you want to be."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Swish 135b. Another way to test is behavioral: Find a way to createthe cues that are represented in your partner's cue picture. If thatpicture is of your partner's own behavior, as it was with Jack, askhim to actually do it. If that picture is of someone else offeringa chocolate or a cigarette, or yelling, then I want you to do thatwith your partner and observe what she does and how she re-sponds.If the old behavior is still there when you test, back up anddo the swish pattern again. See if you can figure out what youleft out, or what else you can do to make this process work. I'mteaching you a very simple version of a much more generalpattern. I know that some of you have questions, but I want youto try doing this first before asking them. After you've actuallytried it, your questions will be much more interesting. Take aboutfifteen minutes each. Go ahead.As I went around the room, I observed many of you suc-ceeding. Let's not talk about that unless you had difficulty andthen came up with something interesting that made it work. Iwant to hear about when it didn't work.Amy: I want to stop smoking. But when we tested, I stillhave the urge to smoke."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"136 Using Your BrainOK. Describe your first picture for me.Amy: I see myself with a cigarette in my mouth, and—Stop. It's very important that you don't see yourself in thatfirst picture, and that you do see yourself in the second picture.That's an essential part of what makes the swish work. The firstpicture has to be an associated image of what you see out of yourown eyes as you start to smoke—your hand reaching for a ciga-rette, for instance. If you see your hand with a cigarette in it, doyou feel compulsed to smoke? Or is it seeing the cigarettes?Whatever it is, I want you to make a picture of what you see thatfires off that feeling of wanting to smoke; make a picture ofwhatever precedes smoking. It might be reaching for a cigarette,lighting it, bringing it up to your lips, or whatever else you do.Try the process with that picture, and report back.Man: Which book has this process in it?None. Why would I teach you something that is already in abook? You're adults; you can read, I have always thought it wasreally idiotic for someone to write a book and then to go andread it to people at seminars. But a lot of people do exactly that,and some of them make a lot of money, so I guess it has someuse.Woman: In a lot of the earlier NLP techniques you substitutea specific new behavior. But in this one you just see the wayyou'd be different if you changed.That's right. That's what makes this pattern so generative.Rather than substituting a specific behavior, you're creating adirection. You're using what's often called \"self-image,\" a verypowerful motivator, to set that direction.When I was in Toronto in January, a woman said she had aphobia of worms. Since Toronto is frozen over most of the year,I didn't think that would be too much of a problem, so I said,\"Well, why don't you just avoid them?\" She said \"Well, it justdoesn't fit with the way I see myself.\" That mismatch motivatedher very strongly, even though the worm phobia wasn't actuallythat much of a problem for her. It wasn't even what I call a\"flaming phobia.\" It was an \"ahhh!\" phobia, rather than an\"AAHHGGH!\" phobia. She didn't yet have her brain direction-alized appropriately, but that image of herself kept her trying. So"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Swish 137of course I asked her \"If you made this change, how would yousee yourself differently?\" The effectiveness of this pattern dependsmost importantly on getting the answer to that question. Thisprocess doesn't get you to an endpoint—it propels you in aparticular direction. If you saw yourself doing something in par-ticular, you would only program in that one new choice. If yousee yourself being a person with different qualities, that newperson can generate many new specific possibilities. Once you setthat direction, the person will start generating specific behaviorfaster than you can believe.If I had used the standard phobia cure on her, she wouldn'tcare about worms at all, and wouldn't even notice them. To getsomebody to not care about something is too easy, and there isenough of that going on in the world already. If I had built in aspecific behavior, like picking up worms, then she'd be able topick up worms. Neither of those changes are particularly profoundin terms of this woman's personal evolution. It seems to me thatthere are more interesting changes that a human being can make.When I swished her, I set up a direction so that she is drawntoward that image of herself as more competent, happier, morecapable, liking herself better, and most important, able to believethat she can quickly make changes in the way she wants to.Woman: I think I understand that, but I'm trying to fit it inwith some of the NLP anchoring techniques I learned earlier. Forinstance, there's a technique where you make a picture of howyou'd like to be, then step into it to get the kinesthetic feelings,and then anchor that state.Right. That's one of the old techniques. It has its uses, butit also has certain drawbacks. If someone has a really detailedand accurate internal representation, you can create a specificbehavior that will work very nicely. But if you just make a pictureof what you'd like to be like, and step inside it to feel what it'slike to be there, that doesn't necessarily mean that you are therewith any quality, or that you learned much along the way. It's anexcellent way to build self-delusions, and it also doesn't give youanywhere else to go.A lot of people go to therapists asking to feel more confident,when they're incompetent. That lack of confidence may be ac-"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"138 Using Your Braincurate feedback about their abilities. If you use anchoring to makesomeone feel confident, that feeling may allow her to do thingsshe actually could do already but wasn't confident enough to try.That will increase her abilities as well. But it may only createoverconfidence—someone who is still incompetent but doesn't no-tice it any more! There are plenty of people like that aroundalready, and they're often dangerous to others as well as tothemselves. I've been commenting for years about how manypeople ask a therapist for confidence, and so few ask for com-petence.You can change somebody so that he believes he's the verybest at something he does, when he can't do it very well at all.When a person is good at acting confident, he usually convinceslots of other people to trust in abilities that he doesn't have. Itnever ceases to amaze me how many people think that if an\"expert\" acts confident, he must know what he is doing. I figurethat as long as you are going to have a false sense of security,you might as well develop some competence along the way.Where's Amy? Did you finish doing the swish with the newpicture?Amy: Yes.How long did it take you to do that five times?Amy: Quite a while.I thought so. I want you to do it again faster. It should onlytake you a second or two each time. Speed is also a very importantelement of this pattern. Brains don't learn slowly, they learn fast.I'm not going to let you do the process wrong and then comeback later and say, \"Oh, it didn't work.\" Do it now, and I'll watchyou. Open your eyes after each swish. . . ,Now make that first picture. What happens? . . .Amy: It goes away now.Do you want a cigarette? (He holds out a pack of cigarettes.)Amy: No thank you.Is the compulsion there? I don't care if you smoke or not. Iwant to know if that automatic urge is there or not. A few minutesago you said you had the urge to smoke.Amy: I don't feel compelled to smoke right now.Here. Hold the cigarettes; take one out and hold it between"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Swish 139your fingers. Look at them; fool with them.When you do change work, don't back away from testing it;push it. Events in the world are going to push it, so you may aswell do it so you can find out right away. That way you can dosomething about it. Observing your client's nonverbal responseswill give you much more information than the verbal answers toyour questions. (Amy smells the cigarettes, and her facial expres-sion shifts quickly.) Oops, there it is again; the smell of thecigarettes brought back the compulsion. You'll have to go backand do the swish again, and add in smell this time. In that firstpicture, when you see someone offer you a cigarette, you'll smellthat cigarette smell. And in that second picture, you'll see yourselfsatisfied that you can smell cigarettes and not be compulsed. Goback and do it again that way.This is called being thorough. A mathematician doesn't justget an answer and say, \"OK, I'm done.\" He tests his answerscarefully, because if he doesn't, other mathematicians will! Thatkind of rigor has always been missing from therapy and education.People try something and then do a two-year follow-up study tofind out if it worked or not. If you test rigorously, you can findout what a technique works for and what it doesn't work for, andyou can find out right away. And where you find out that itdoesn't work, you need to try some other technology.What I've taught you here is a simplified version of a moregeneral swish pattern. Even so, some of you got lost and confused.Another way to be thorough is to swish in all systems to startwith. But it's usually much more economical to just do it in thevisual system and then test rigorously to find out what else youneed to add. Often you don't need to add in anything. Eitherthat person doesn't need it, or she will add it in on her ownwithout realizing it.Amy, what happens now when you smell a cigarette?Amy: It's different. It's hard for me to say how it's different.Now when I smell it I want to put it down, instead of smokingit.Brains don't learn to get results; they learn to go in directions.Amy had learned one set of behaviors; \"Would you like a ciga-rette\"—\"Yes\"—light up and puff.

She has justused that same ability to learn to go somewhere else.When you start beginning to use your brain to get it to dowhat you want it to do, you have to rigorously set up the directionyou want it to go, and you need to do it ahead of time. Disap-pointment is not the only thing that requires adequate planning.Everything else does, too. Without adequate planning you becomecompulsed to do things you don't want to do: to show yourselfold memories and feel bad about them, to do things that destroyyour body, to yell at people you love, to act like a mouse whenyou're furious. • . .All those things can be changed, but not while you're in thesituation. You can reprogram yourself later, or you can programyourself ahead of time. Brains aren't designed to get results; theylearn to go in directions. If you know how the brain works, youcan set your own directions. If you don't, then someone else will.What I've just taught you is what I often do in a one-day ortwo-day seminar. The \"standard\" swish pattern is something thatsomebody can grab hold of and use, and it will work more oftenthan not. But it doesn't demonstrate to me any competent un-derstanding of what the underlying pattern is. If you give anyonea cookbook, he can bake a cake. But if you give a chef acookbook, he'll come up with a better product. A really fine chefknows things about the chemistry of cooking that guide what hedoes and how he does it. He knows what the egg whites are doingin there; he know what their function is. To a chef, it isn't just amatter of throwing a bunch of stuff together and whipping it up.He knows that certain things make things gel into a certainconsistency, certain things have to be added in a particular order,and certain other ingredients have to do with changing the flavorin one way or another.The same thing is true when you begin to use the swishpattern. As a first step toward becoming a chef, I want you totry using the swish pattern again, but find out what happens ifyou change one element. Last time we used the submodalities ofsize, brightness and association/dissociation as the elements thatchange as one picture swishes to the other."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Swish 141Two of those elements, size and brightness, are elements thatchange continuously over a range. Anything that can be changedgradually is called an analogue variable. Association/dissociationis what we call a digital variable, because it's either one or theother. You are either inside of an experience, or outside of it;you don't gradually go from one to the other. Association/disso-ciation will always be one element of the swish. The other twoanalogue elements can be any two elements that have a powerfuleffect for the person.This time I want you to keep everything the same, exceptyou'll use distance instead of size. The first picture will start outbright and close. The second picture will start out dark and faraway, and then it will quickly come closer as it brightens, whilethe first picture recedes into the distance and darkens. This is afairly small change, and to some of you it may not seem differentat all, since size and closeness are strongly correlated. But it is afirst step toward teaching you how to use the swish pattern in amuch more general and flexible way. Take another fifteen minutesto do the swish with distance, instead of size.Did using distance rather than size make a difference forsome of you? You can use any submodality distinctions to do the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"142 Using Your Brainswish, but it will only work well if the distinctions you use aresubjectively powerful to the person you are working with. Bright-ness and size are powerful for most people, so the version I taughtyou first will work more often than not. Distance is anothersubmodality that is important to many people, so I had you trythat one next. But if size, brightness, and distance aren't importantto the person, then you have to find out which submodalities areimpactful, and design a swish using those.A couple of years ago I saw three clients for a videotapesession (see Appendix II). The first client I saw was a womanwho was suffering from \"anticipatory loss.\" I love the names theycome up with to describe how people are messed up! What itboiled down to was that if she had arranged to meet someonewho was close to her and that person was a half-hour late, shehad what she called a panic attack. She lost her marbles andbegan to step on them. When I asked her what she would like tohave from the session, this is what she said:I have a problem with a fear that is almost disablingto me at certain times. When I have it, I sort of go intopanic attacks. What I would like to do is distance myself,so that when I'm in the situation I wouldn't experiencethe fear to the degree that I have it, where I couldcontrol myself and make better decisions.Since she talked about wanting to \"distance\" herself, she gaveme a clear indication that distance was an important submodalityfor her. She also talked a lot about people who were \"close toher\" and \"close relationships.\" Later when talking about what shedid when someone was late she said, \"I need to allow them somedistance—I mean allow them some time.\" With this woman aswish using distance will be much more powerful than one usingsize. In fact, I went ahead and tried the standard swish using sizeto find out if it would work. It had very little impact. Then Iused distance, and it worked perfectly.The most important part of doing the swish in a really artisticway is to carefully gather the information you need to set it upappropriately. When someone talks about something being \"bigger"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Swish 143than life\" or being \"blown out of proportion,\" that's a prettygood indication that size is an important variable to use.When somebody describes a limitation he wants to change,you need to be able to pay attention to how this particular problemworks. I always keep in mind that anything that anybody hasdone is an achievement, no matter how futile or painful it maybe. People aren't broken; they work perfectly! The important ques-tion is, \"How do they work now?\" so that you can help themwork perfectly in a way that is more pleasant and useful.One of the things I do to gather information is to say to theclient, \"Well, let's say I had to fill in for you for a day. One ofthe things I would have to do is have your limitation. How wouldI do it? You have to teach me how to have this problem.\" As Ibegin to presuppose that it's an achievement—something learnedthat can be taught to someone else—it entirely changes the waythe person is able to deal with and think about the difficulty.When I asked the woman who panicked when people werelate to teach me how to do it, she said:You start telling yourself sentences like, \"They'relate; they may never come.\"Do you say this in a bored tone of voice—\"Hohum\"?No. The voice starts out slowly, \"Give them anotherhalf hour.\" Then it speeds up as the time gets closer.Do you have any pictures in there?Yes. 1 see a picture of the person maybe in a wreck,as if I'm standing there looking on, like through a zoomlens. At other times I'm looking around through my owneyes out at the world and there's no one there.So in her case she has a voice that speeds up and rises inpitch as time goes on. At a certain point the voice says, \"They'llnever come\" and she makes close-up, zoom-lens pictures of theperson in a wreck, or of being all alone.When I asked her to try making the picture of the wreck, Ifound that zooming in or out had a very strong effect. When Itested brightness, she said, \"The dimness creates distance.\" That"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"144 Using Your Braintells me that brightness is also a factor.Now I want you to pair up with someone and ask him tothink of a limitation—something that he considers a problem andwants to change. This time I don't want you to fix it; I only wantyou to find out how this achievement works. Use the frame of\"Let's say I had to fill in for you for a day. Teach me what todo.\" Do the same thing you did earlier when you found out howa person got motivated to do something.Whenever someone is compulsed to do something he doesn'twant to do, something inside has to amplify to a certain point.Something has to get bigger or brighter or louder, or the tonechanges, or the tempo speeds up or slows down. I want you tofind out how this person achieves this particular limitation. Firstask him when to do it, and then find out how he does it: whatdoes he do on the inside that drives his response? When youthink you have identified the crucial submodalities, test by askingyour partner to vary them one at a time, and observe how itchanges his response. Then ask him to take a different pictureand again vary the same submodalities, to see if it changes hisresponse to this other picture in the same way. Find out enoughabout how it works so that you could do this person's limitationif you wanted to. When you have this information, it will tell youprecisely how to swish this particular individual.

In one of them he sees jerkymovement, and in the other one the movements are smooth andgraceful,OK. Do these two pictures create and maintain whatever heconsidered to be the difficulty? That was my question. I didn'task about where the person wants to go yet: I only asked how hecreates the difficulty. With the woman with panic attacks, she hasto get from the state of \"Ho, hum\" to the state of \"freaking out.\"She starts with a voice and pictures. Then she has to make thevoice get faster and higher-pitched, and the picture gets closerand closer as time runs out.Man: My partner has a feeling of urgency—Of course. That's the feeling of compulsion. But how doeshe make that feeling? What is the critical submodality? In essence,what you want to know is, \"How does this person already swishhimself from one state of consciousness to another?\"Man: What makes it different for him is wrapping the picturearound him. He pulls it in and around himself and steps into thepicture and looks at the picture from his own eyes.OK. Good. That's how he gets into the state he doesn't wantto be in.Man: Yes. He first gets into that state, and then dissociatesby stepping out of it, putting it back over here to his left, awayfrom him, and stands at a distance of several feet away from it,OK.

What we want to know is how they are related,so we can use that relationship to build a swish.What you need to know in order to build a swish for her iswhether or not narrowing any picture makes her responsestronger, and whether dimming any picture makes her responsestronger. You see, it may be that she uses the word \"constrained\"because she doesn't like the particular choice that she's left within that picture. If she sees a choice she likes and the picturenarrows, she may describe the feeling as \"purposeful,\" or \"com-mitted.\" If narrowing and dimming make her response stronger,you can build a swish for her by starting with a narrow, dim\"problem state\" picture which gets wider and brighter as thedesired state picture gets narrower and dimmer. That will soundstrange to most of you, but keep in mind that everyone's brain iscoded somewhat differently. What makes the swish really elegantis designing it so that a particular brain will respond to it strongly.The other alternative is that making this particular picture offew choices narrow increases the intensity her feeling constrained,but that making an image of her with choices gets a strongerresponse if she broadens it. In that case, you could have theproblem picture narrow down to a line, and the solution pictureopen up out of that same line. So you'll have to go back and findout more about how it works before you'll know the best way todesign a swish for her.I'm telling you about these possibilities so you begin to un-derstand how important it is to tailor your change method to eachperson.

Or is the angle fixed and some-thing else changes?Man: It starts out being straight up and down, and as thesituation changes, it becomes slanted.So as the picture tilts, so does she. When it reaches a certainangle, she panics. Does the picture have the double border whenit's vertical?Man: Yes.So the border is not a critical element, it just happens to bethere. Does anything else happen as the picture tilts? Does itchange brightness or anything like that?

It seems like just tilting animage wouldn't be enough. You can go back and ask her. Haveher take a picture of something else and tilt it and find out whathappens.

Fairly quickly the voicechanges and becomes monotonous and low. That's when he feelsbad.The picture remains constant? It doesn't change at all? I findit a little difficult to believe that while he changes his tone andtempo of speech, the slide remains constant—that the brightnessor something else about it doesn't change—because I simplyhaven't found it. That doesn't mean it's not possible, but I findit very unlikely. People can lead auditorily, but usually somethingelse changes along with the voice. Let's assume that he's lookingat a picture and he just talks himself from one state to anotherby changing his tone of voice. That will work. You will also needanother auditory parameter if you are going to do an auditoryswish. Probably the tempo will change. There will usually be morethan one parameter that changes.Man: If you are looking for another variable, and could get"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Swish 149one in another modality so you had one visual and one auditorysubmodality, would that mixture work?It can, but most of the time you don't need it. You could dothat if you really couldn't find a second submodality in the samesystem. The reason I'm emphasizing the visual system is becausethe visual system has the property of simultaneity. You can easilysee two different pictures together at once. The auditory systemis more sequential. It's hard to pay attention to two voices atonce. You can do a swish auditorily, but you have to go about ita little differently. If you learn to be precise in the visual system,then when you start dealing with the auditory channel it will beeasier to adapt.Man: The reason I asked that is because with my partner thepictures change, but also as she steps into the picture, she canhear herself. I'm wondering in doing the swish whether it wouldsort of nail it shut by adding an auditory piece.Yeah. \"Nailing it shut\" is a good way to think about it. Ifyou do a swish with only one submodality, that's like nailing twoboards together from only one direction. A dovetail joint has nailsor screws going into it from two directions at once. If you pullone way, one set of nails holds it; if you pull the other way, thesecond set of nails holds it. That's why it's important to use twopowerful submodalities simultaneously when you do the swish.People usually won't vary more than one submodality at a timeon their own, and you'd have to vary at least two at once to undoa swish.If you're doing a visual swish and there are also auditorycomponents, typically the person will demonstrate the auditoryshifts to you unconsciously as she tells you about the two pictures.Then when you are telling her to make the pictures, you can dothe auditory shifts externally with your voice, without mentioningit. In order to do that well, you need to be able to speak insomeone else's voice.The skill to be able to copy someone else's voice is simply amatter of practice, and it's a talent that is well worth learning todo in this business.

You need enough so that if you do some-body's voice, he won't notice whether he is talking to himself oryou are.

Someof you already have that information, but a lot of you don't.Next I want you to get that second picture of how he wouldsee himself differently if he no longer had the limitation. Thispicture must be dissociated, and the first picture will always beassociated. Association in the first picture and dissociation in thesecond will always be one element of the swish.Next you'll build a swish using the two analogue submodalitiesyou've identified as important (instead of the size and brightnessyou used in the standard swish). First have your partner make anassociated picture of the cues, using whatever submodalities createa strong response (a big, bright picture). Then have your partnermake a dissociated picture of themselves as they would like tobe, beginning with the other extreme of those same submodalities(a small, dim picture). When you swish, the submodalities willchange so as to rapidly weaken the response to the first pictureat the same time that they strengthen the response to the secondpicture.

You can always just try the standardswish. If it doesn't work you can try a different one and keepgoing until you find one that works. That is certainly better thannot trying another one. But it's even better to gather enoughinformation so that you know exactly what you're doing, and youcan predict ahead of time what will work and what won't. Doyou have any questions?Man: What do you do with a client who doesn't have muchawareness of internal process? When I ask some of my clientshow they do things inside, they just shrug and say, \"I don't know.\"There are several things you can do. One is to keep askinguntil they pay attention inside. Another is to ask a lot of questionsand read the nonverbal \"yes/no\" responses. Ask, \"Are you talkingto yourself?\" and watch the response just before the verbal \"Idon't know.\" This technique is discussed fully in the book Trance-formations.Another thing you can do is to create the problem situationand observe the person's behavior. All submodality shifts aredemonstrated in external behavior. For instance, when someonebrightens a picture, the head rotates back and up, but when apicture comes closer, the head moves straight back. If you observepeople when you ask them to make submodality changes, you cancalibrate to the behavioral shifts that we call \"submodality ac-cessing cues.\" Then you can use those shifts to determine whatsomeone is doing inside, even when he's not aware of it. I alwaysuse this calibration as a check to be sure the client is doing whatI ask him to.Like everything else in NLP, the more you know how changeworks, and the more you are calibrated to behavioral responses,the more you can do things covertly. For instance, sometimes aperson has to practice the swish a few times. You can ask her todo it once, and then ask her, \"Did you do it right?\" In order toanswer that question, she'll have to do it again. Then you canask, \"Are you sure you did it right?\" and she'll have to do itagain. She'll also do it faster and easier that way because she isn'tconsciously trying to do it."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"152 Using Your BrainWoman: Do you have any long-term follow-up studies of theeffectiveness of this method?I'm much more interested in twenty-minute follow-up studies.The only good reason for a long-term follow-up study is if youcan't tell when the person changes in your office. Think aboutthis: if you did produce a change in someone and they remainedchanged in that way for five years, what does that prove? Thatsays nothing about whether or not that change is a valuable one,or whether or not it could have evolved any further. You see,making it possible for a woman to not be phobic of worms or notbe compulsed to eat chocolate, is not a very profound accomplish-ment, even if it lasts the rest of her life. The important thing tounderstand about the swish pattern is that it sets the person in adirection that is generative and evolutionary. When I have donelonger-term follow-ups on people I've swished, they typically re-port that the change I had made became the basis for all kindsof other changes that they are pleased with. The swish patterndoesn't tell people how to behave, it keeps them on the track ofgoing toward what they want to become.

Anything can be changed. That's something VirginiaSatir said the first time I saw her give a workshop, and it'sabsolutely true. Any physicist knows that. Any human being canbe changed with a .45—that's called \"co-therapy with Mr. Smithand Mr. Wesson.\" Whether a change is useful or not is a moreinteresting question.The technology that you have been learning here is verypowerful. The question about how you will use it, and what youwill use it for, is one that I hope you will consider very carefully—not as a burden, but with the curiosity to find out what'sworthwhile. The experiences in your life which have been themost beneficial to you in the long run, and which provide thebasis of your being able to have pleasure, satisfaction, enjoyment,and happiness, were not necessarily utterly enjoyable at the timethey occurred.

That can always remind you that it's an achieve-ment, no matter how futile, disgusting or repulsive it may be.The ability to be fascinated by the complexity of that achieve-ment distinguishes somebody who is working in a generative wayfrom one who is working in a remedial way. Without that senseof curiosity, those things which are futile, repulsive and disgustingwill be things that you won't know how to influence. Withoutthat influence, people will continue to fight wars over strangeplaces and over insignificant differences, without being able tofind new ways in which everybody can come out ahead. Theessence of being generative is to create a world in which everybodygains because there are ways of creating more, rather than havinga limited amount to fight over and divide up.Everything a human being can do is an achievement, de-pending only on where, and when, and for what, it is utilized.Each of both of you can do something about that, because eachof both of you is going to drive your own bus. Now that youknow how, the interesting question is where? When you can'tdrive your bus, it doesn't matter much where you try to go,because you won't get there anyway. When you learn how to useyour brain, that question becomes crucially important. Some peo-ple drive in circles. Some people take the same route every day.Some people take the same route, but it takes them a monthinstead of a day."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Afterword 159There is so much more inside our minds than we suspect.There is so much more outside than we are capable of beingcurious about. It's only that growing sense of curiosity that allowsyou to capture the enthusiasm that makes even the most mundane,or the most fascinating task worthwhile, fun, and intriguing. With-out that, life is nothing more than waiting in line. You can masterthe art of tapping your foot while you wait in line, or you cando much more. And I have a surprise for you. I've found outthat the after-life begins with a long wait in line. You'd betterhave some fun now, because those who enjoy themselves and dothings that are worth doing with a great sense of curiosity get tostand in a shorter line than those who have only developed theability to wait in line.No matter where you are or what you are doing, the skills,the techniques and the tools that you have acquired here serveas the basis for amusing yourself, and for learning something new.That man who flew with me to Texas, and explained to me whatNLP was, is only different from me in one way. The next morningwhen he sat down and looked up and saw me, and thought, \"Oh,my God!\" he didn't realize that I learned something from him.That is the only difference between me and him. I didn't do it tomake a fool out of him; I did it in order to learn, because I wascurious. It was a rare and unprecedented opportunity.
