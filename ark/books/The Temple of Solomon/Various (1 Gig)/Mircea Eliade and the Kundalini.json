[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"MIRCEA ELIADE AND THE KUNDALINIMalin FitgerMircea Eliade was born in Romania and in 1957 he became professor in history ofreligions at the university of Chicago. During his life he published many books and hewas chief editor of the Encyclopedia of Religions (1976-86). He traveled all over the worldand besides from in Romania and USA he worked also in London, Paris and Lisbon.Eliade can be said to be part of a hermeneutical, phenomenological tradition which fitswell into German idealism. Eliade means like Rudolf Otto that one can not reducereligious phenomena to psychological or social products; religion can only beunderstood with its own terms and the scholar should instead explore what differentphenomena ”has to say”. According to Eliade, not only children and primitive peoplesare using a symbolic thinking. This is an ability that we all share. The symbolic thinkingis deeper than language and reason, and he believes like C.G Jung that the symbols fillsa function in the psyche through making deep aspects of the being conscious. He writes:”The symbol reveals certain aspects of reality – the deeper aspects – which defy anyother means of knowledge... Consequently, the study of them enables us to reach abetter understanding of man – of man ‘as he is’, before he has come to terms with theconditions of history.”Each symbol can contain numerous significations, not only one of these significations issolely the true one. To use a terminology in which the symbol is limited to only atangible signification is according to Eliade to annihilate the symbol, it will no longerfunction as it did in the mind.Like Otto, Eliade describes religion as first and foremost an experience of the numinous,belonging to ”the sacred sphere”. He writes that we can conceive the world in two ways:as profane or as sacred. When something is turned into a cult object we will change ourbehaviour towards it, it becomes a manifestation of the sacred. Eliade ́s writings areconnected by a comprehensive view, which strives to describe the distinctiveness andanchorage of religion in a supernal reality. Eliade advocated to a certain degree auniversal religious humanism with elements of eastern metaphysics and experiences ofnature. On the invitation of an Indian Maharaja Eliade traveled to Calcutta and to thenorth of India where he studied Indian philosophy and ascetic practice. He publishedmany writings about yoga, the most known is probably Yoga: Immortality and Freedom.Kundalini and the symbolism around ”the centre of the world”What differs a historian of religions from an ordinary historian is according to Eliadethat the historian of religions is not only trying to describe historical facts, but alsomythological. He explains:”Although it is true that man is always found ”in situations”, his situation is not for allthat, always a historical one in the sense of being conditioned solely by thecontemporaneous historical moment. The man in his totality is aware of other situationsover and above his historical condition; for example, he knows the state of dreaming, orof the waking dream, or of melancholy, or of detachment, or of æsthetic bliss, or ofescape, etc. – and none of these states is hitorical, although they are as authentic and asimportant for human existence as man ́s historical existence is”."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"According to Eliade the historical consciousness has a minor significance in the completemind of man and if we include the unconscious an even lesser significance. In his bookThe Myth of the Eternal Return, Eliade describes the symbolic world of the archaic man,where the surrounding world is viewed as a microcosm, surrounded by the unknown,the formless. Eliade means that all sacred objects and all rituals, according to the archaicman, has a divine, archetypal prototype. Every sacred act is connected to themythological time in the dawn of the world, just as every sacred area is believed to the”the centre of the world”. According to Eliade most myths of creation describes how theworld is created through growing out from a centre-point. This centre-point can bedescribed as an axis which penetrates and connects the three worlds: heaven, earth andthe underworld. He writes:”The most widely distributed variant of the symbolism of the centre is the Cosmic Tree,situated in the middle of the universe, and upholding the three worlds as upon one axis.Vedic India, ancient China and the Germanic mythology, as well as the”primitive”religions, all held different versions of this Cosmic Tree, whose roots plungeddown into hell, and whose branches reached to heaven”.It is a Paradox that all sacred areas in the mythological geography can be said to be thecentre of the world. In this way every sacred hindu pilgrimage area is identified as beingthe centre of the world, which in the form of axis mundi is also a meeting point betweenthe different worlds, a place where the gods are present. since the human body, in theIndian mythology is a microcosm in relation to the world, also the centre of the worldcan be found in man and the pilgrimage becomes an inner journey. Eliade writes aboutthe tantric symbolism:”Unlike the archaic man or the man of Vedic times, the Tantric devotee had need ofpersonal experience reactivate certain promordial symbols in his consciousness. That iswhy, moreover, some Tantric schools rejected the external mandala and had recourse tointeriorized mandalas”.The mandala is often a symbol of the cosmos and its centre represents the centre of theworld. To reach this centre signifies in the myths a form of initiation, a transcendencefrom the profane to the sacred. Even if the centre of the world is present in everymicrocosm the path can be difficult and dangerous, which according to Eliade can beillustrated by the hero who is lost in its maze, fights dragons etc, in his search for thesacred tree and ”fruit of life”. In tantrism the mandala is used as an instrument whichassists the yogi in meditation. Eliade writes:”The mandala ‘concentrates’; it preserves one from distraction. The discovery of themandala on his own body indicates a desire to deny his ‘mythological body’ with amicrocosm.”According to Eliade, chakras can be viewed as meeting points between the cosmic andthe mental life and their awakening is homologous to the initiatoric symbolism of thepenetration of the mandala. The awakening of the kundalini can thus be said to reflectan archetypal symbolism, the realization of the ontological level, the centre of the world.According to Eliade the symbolism around the centre of the world is a recurring themein most religions, and i believe that this in a representative way illustrates his views, bothof religion in general and also of tantrism. Eliade has in one respect accepted the orientalthought that tantrism embodies the most extreme, ”completely different”, aspect of theIndian thinking, which arose from the religious consciousness of the pre-vedic pelasgicpopulation, since the cult of the mother goddess had not yet been subdued by theandrocentric Aryan tribes. The kundalini is mentioned, according to Eliade both in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"form of a serpent, a goddess and as ”energy”. The Hathayogapradipika presents thekundalini with the following names: Kutilangi which means ”lingering body”, Bhujangiwhich means ”A she serpent”, Sakti, Isvari, Kundali, Kundalini and Arundhati ,according to Eliade all these names ar synonymous. The kundalini is identifies with theSabdabrahman and with the name OM and she contains all the attributes of all gods andgoddesses. According to certain myths the goddess Sakti was created from the fireenergies of the gods. The nature of the kundalini is often described as fire-like in itscharacter: in the buddhistic tantric writings it is said that the awakening brings theexperience of ”a great fire”. Eliade points out that the production of inner heat is anancient magical technique which also can be found in shamanism. According to Eliadetantrism joins in this aspect the universal magical tradition, even if the spiritual contentsof tantrism partly belongs to another level.© Dragon Rougewww.dragonrouge.net"}]
