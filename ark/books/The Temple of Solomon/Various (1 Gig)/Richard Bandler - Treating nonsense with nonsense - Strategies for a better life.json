I discovered it wasn'tgood enough to teach people how to do good things. I had to teach them how tomake good choices to start with, coz it all boils down in the end to making goodthings and so that the decisions that you make will be better in the future.The inverse is also true, if you feel bad so you start to make decisions ... Peoplebreak up their marriage, they are depressed and so they go: ”Who am I gonnabe with now?” And when they are propelled from a bad feeling they're gonnamake bad decisions. So this makes it so important to feel good before you startdeciding what to decide. Otherwise your decisions will not be good decisions.The more you make good decisions the better decisions you will make. Themore you make bad decisions - and this is why people have cycles of ups anddowns coz it takes very little to change that course around. This is why youhave to be so careful that when things are really going bad that you really stopand put yourself into a good state before you re going to make decisions aboutwhat you're going to do about it. And people go: ”Well that is not very realistic!”And I go: ”Yeah, but it works!”They told me it is realistic to dredge around in people's childhood to try to figureout how to make them happy adults. To me it sounds absolutely absurd - theidea that because your parents didn't love you enough as a child ... You know Ihad a crappy childhood, but you know what? I just don't think about it muchbecause I've had a wonderful life as an adult and I made sure it stayed thatway. And people say: ”Well, if you repress this stuff it will come out somewhereelse.” Well, it will. It will come out in their childhood!To me the Dalai Lama summed it up quite well: ”Sometimes bad things happen- you just don't dwell on them.” If you throw a pebble into a pond it makesripples for a while but eventually it smoothes out. When people dwell on thingstoo much they blow them out of proportion. This is one of those phrases.Psychologists said they observed people. They did this in a way where theydidn't let their own personal feelings get involved. I am not like that. I ampersonally involved with everyone that I change their lives because they don‘tcome to me first to start with. I am not anybody's first choice. By the time theyget to me they‘ve been through everything, and pretty much they are told thatthis is their last hope. And I always look at them and smile and say: ”Well, thenyou're in big trouble! Because I am not gonna fix you. Coz‘ I don't think you'rebroken. I think you are just stupid. And one thing that's nice about acceptingthat you're stupid is that you can always get smarter.”I accept that I am stupid.Interruption from the waiterSo where were we? You were going to interview me.Ronnie: You mentioned that late at night you are working on a new book. Whatis your new book going to be about?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch2Richard: Actually there is a couple that I've been working on. One is called\"Back from the abyss”. That is primarily a book of fiction. As I say in thebeginning there is not one shred of truth in it. So nobody has to be afraid ofanything. It kind of oscillates between stories and stories about the stories. It's abook that is designed to dispell fear. It makes fun of absolutely everything -especially me!Because I believe that one of the problems is that people can't poke fun atthings. And that's why things become much more serious than they ever oughtto be. That the idea that there are laws of thermodynamic, the absolutepompousness of people who made those things up ... that's why I made up thethree universal laws of human modeling! And people were asking: ”We arewriting our termpaper and what do we reference?” And I said: ”Well, thestructure of magic, that's where I laid them out.” And they said: Well, you didn'tmake them sound like they were laws?” I said: ”Well, other people make uplaws, why can't I?” I make up my own laws.To me it's the silly things: I have been accused of such horrid things. But I neverthought that they have done a terribly good job of it. So I accuse myself ofeverything: I blame myself for the black plague. I blame myself for everythingthat's ever gone wrong on this planet. See, to me it's not where you put blame.It's what you can get done that counts!All these people who have all that time end energy to pluck names of howthey're trainers of NLP, head of the German society, head of the Swiss society.But if they have no connection with me they have nothing. Because it is thethread that runs from me to people that is about really the strongest thing thatNLP is about. It's about an attitude. And the attitude says that things can getbetter and that things should be based on doing the right thing for the rightreason. Not because people are inherently helpful but because doing helpfulthings is the right thing to do. You can't sit by and watch children starve. It's thewrong thing to do. And people have known this for centuries and there is onlyone thing you can do about it and that is to feed them. And start with the onewhich is the closest to you and work your way out.It's wrong for people to have such wonderful lifespans and no life. To me it'sonly as we conquer fear ... which is as we said in the workshop I was doing withyou, two years ago. When you realize how easy it is to take the sensations thatconstitute fear which stop people from doing everything. It stops them frombeing intimate, it stops them from being kind, it stops them from doing the thingsin life that they wanna do. They are afraid of poverty and yet they never had it,they don't know what it is. They are afraid to try things, they are afraid to dothings. They are so afraid they hide behind this pompous beenpusher attitude,where they think titles make up for skills. They think hours make up forenthusiasm. It is not how many hours you spend in a practitioner course. It ishow enthusiastic the person who teaches it is. It is not how long it goes on. It ishow much information is transferred from one person to another. It is how muchskill the other one has.I know of things which are so absurd. I met someone on an airplane who pulledout my book and started reading it. I laughed and said: ”Are you enjoying thatbook?” The guy said: ”No, but it is very important!” And I said: ”What is it you'retrying to get out of it? Because actually I've read that book. It was about thirtyyears ago and my memory is that there is not that much in it.”And he said: ”I've been in a course for nine months studying the Meta Model”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch3Interruption from waiterRonnie: Lately I‘ve read some articles in NLP Magazines for instancediscussions about the Neurological Level Model of Robert Dilts that are sopompous, they strike me like some medieval scholars arguing whether Jesuscould have saved the world in the shape of a pea ...Richard sees an article in the magazine on the table: See that picture rightthere? That picture there belongs to me! That does not belong to whoever wrotethe article. That picture there is mine and it is out of my book!Now, what's it doing in his article? He didn't ask me permission for that! It saysright here: it‘s the NLP eye accessing cue for normally right handed people.No, it is not! It is Richard Bandler's eye accessing cue chart from RichardBandler's book. Now that makes this man a plagiarist. NLP has never writtenanything. It's a word. It's not a human being, it does not own anything, it is justthree letters out of the alphabet which I put together as the name of what I do.And I have been very generous about sharing it with people but there are a lotof people who have been much more generous with themselves about stealingit. And that person who published it is guilty of not checking his fax. And heshould not publish things by people who are plagiarists. So the publisher of thismagazine is just putting things in there to make money. He is not checking hisfax like a good journalist should, because he knows what book that came from.But it didn’t quote it from my book. I didn’t see a footnote in there. But yet hepublishes articles by people and he just doesn’t care. Because he’s in it for abuck. It’s a good marketing ploy, you know? But I think these people should goand sell aluminum siding and give up my work. Coz' my work is gonna hurtthem and they don’t understand this. My work is dangerous, very dangerous, forthose who do not use it properly. It does not hurt other people, it hurts the oneusing it if they don’t use it properly. They will end up being a bigger and a biggeridiot every day and it will become more apparent. They’ll end up taking onHawaiian guru names and every other idiotic thing you can think of. And Ialways say: ”It doesn't matter, not even a tad.” (laughter) I got that from my wife.The most important thing is that people focus on what it is that my work isabout: My work is about making humans rise above the dung of society - not tobe better than other people, but to be better human beings, better than theywere the day before, and better the next day than they were the day before that.Not bigger idiots, not bigger titles, not more credentials, not bigger plagiarists.Because I tell you I have never seen so many books written about such fewideas.A journalist from Germany said to me one time that she was at a workshop andthey had a table full of books. There must have been 200 different NLP booksout there and she said she bought everyone of them and she went and sheread all these books and she said: ”All of the stuff that was in all of the books isin your book already. So what are these other books for?” And I said: ”Money!That’s what they are for. They‘re not about ideas.Even the book ”Influencing With Integrity” which I find absolutely ludicrous as atitle, right? The introduction is written by somebody R.B., and it’s not me. It’sdone totally to make it look like it’s me, but it’s not me. It’s written by somebodyelse who I guess has those initials but he doesn’t write out his name, it just saysR.B. That’s put there to deceive people, that’s all it’s there for. It’s there to cheatand to trick people. So that when they pick up the book and they see it they’llbuy it and somebody makes some money. And everything that’s in the book is"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch4stolen, including the inside cover plates which were taken from my home. Bysomeone literally stolen, not kind of stolen - literally stolen. There was a gameboard called ”Loosing Your Marbles” that I was making up at the time. Thisperson stole it and put it inside their book. Now to me, I don't care what anyonesays. The truth will be known and the truth will set everyone free in the end. Thetruth is: This guy who owns the journal and this guy who wrote the article did notmake up this work, so I don’t really care if they wanna argue how big a pea ison the nose of Jesus. This does not matter to me one iota..Inger: You are moving so fast that a lot of your old students are falling behind.Richard: Oh, you mean that you have to keep learning things? I don't stop. I amnot done yet. Some people try to avoid learning new things by being more andmore stupid. They forgot what was the most important thing.Which is they didn't get into this so that they could be superior to someone.They didn’t get into this so that they could get stuck. They got into this becausethey tried something new and it gave them a real thrill. For the first time theyhad an impact that the clients changed in ways. But they forgot that in order todo this they went first. See, when they came they didn’t start by just learningsomething and going back and changing somebody else. That’s when the thrillhappened. But what changed first - was them! You can't stay the same, youcan't stay safe. There isn't anything safe anywhere on any planet that I knowabout. It's a very dangerous thing being alive, as soon as you're alive, youknow. Life is the cause of death. Without life there would be no death andpeople forget that what it is all about is having courage to stand up for what youbelieve and being able to take the bodysensations that you have and makethem so that your hopes, your desires, your dreams, the things you care aboutand the people that you work with, that all of that stuff is headed into the samedirection. That it is headed into the future.So the other book that I am doing is I am putting together some CD's. They arelike the tape series I made ten years ago. They were designed to make thehuman spirit to be able fly and in the past few years as you say most everythingis changed. I don't do what I used to do. I don't have to. I found better, faster,quicker, more efficient ways. You know you could sit around for three hoursdoing reframing. I can't believe that they still teach it. They teach it in coursesthat I am teaching with them. They don't teach it when I am around, but I justthink it takes too long and it's too idiotic. It was a good step. But at that time thereason we had to do it was because people thought hypnosis was bad and theythought it didn't exist. These things don't even fit together but yet this was thecurrent belief. So we made up a goofy way that they didn't have to say the wordhypnosis, but they did all the same things. Now that I don’t really think that‘s anissue anymore, I think any competent communicator who thinks hypnosis is bador good is got to be wearing a dress and it has got to have a white collar on it atthe same time. Because anybody else is not thinking about bad or good.They'rethinking about what works and what doesn't work.Ronnie: What are areas you have been exploring recently? You mentionedmodeling some dangerous stuff.Richard: Some things are more dangerous than others. Things are onlydangerous depending on whose hands they're in and how they are used. Manythings that were done by various ”cult leaders” ... Rasputin was a greathypnotist, he was a guy that did miracles and people thought he was a bad guy."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch5Ronnie: My grandmother knew him.Richard: Your grandmother knew him? Oh, that’s wonderful.Ronnie: She met him when she was a companion to the daughter of the Zar.She spent some time with them in their holiday resort at the Black Sea. Shesaid all women were dependent on him and bragged: ”Only I could resist him!”(Laughter)Richard: ”Mmhm, only I!”Ronnie: ”So I even have some small chance to be a bastard grandson ofRasputin.” (Big laughter)Richard: And what a chance that would be! My wife and I found a photograph ofhim the other day and we ..Paula Bandler: I want to morph it with Richard‘s picture.Richard: Bansputin, I can see it now.Ronnie: And he used hypnosis, too?Richard: Oh man, I guess. To me there are some fairly unknown things. That‘spart of the reasons that we went to India. It wasn't just because they wanted meto teach there. But there was lots of good ideas to explore. We went to someplaces where people came to us in droves and shook our hands for being theonly white people they had ever seen there. And I got mad. I said: ”Look, I'm notwhite.”Excuse me, there are some things worth being proud of. Compared to them Imight look white but I certainly don't look white when you put me around otherpeople. I don't have the right ideology. I would never make a good nazi. I'malways too busy looking. There are too many things I wanna see. So when theysay ”not see” (pronounced like nazi). I say: “No, not me. I will see!”Writing all this nonsense about ethnic cleansing. I think we should drop somemirrors down in that country so these people can take a good look atthemselves. You know, that a big tough soldier could chase children out of theirhomes ... I mean, these people should just basically be ashamed of themselvesand until they are we have a lot to teach on this planet. That people think thattorturing children is a good idea, I mean excuse me! These people know betterthan this! But whenever you put groups of dogs or groups of ignorant peopletogether it is no telling what they will do, you know. They run wild. You can takethe most domesticated dogs in the world and you put them in packs and theyrun around and they kill things indiscriminately. And humans are much thesame way and until humans learn to simply say: ”No, I won't do that, that'swrong. And you know it's wrong and I'm not gonna do it!” Until someone says itnobody will stand up and say it. And I'm sure these soldiers don't feel rightabout what they’re doing, they can't.There was one story somebody told on television about how one of the soldiershad helped them to escape, you know. He was supposed to take them out andtake everything away from them. And he took them out and told them to get intheir car and get the hell out of there. He said: ”My uncle is married to an"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch6Albanian. I just can't do this, I don't feel right about what they are making medo.”There’s always gonna be people like that who stand up for what they believe.And those are the people in the end that should be proud of themselves and willalways feel good about what they are doing in the end. Coz‘ he did the rightthing for the right reason. And it’s not that hard. It’s not that hard to feel goodonce you know how your neurology works. I mean, if people can enjoy jumpingout of airplanes they can enjoy just about anything, I think! The fact that theycan jump out of a perfectly good airplane for fun, I mean to me is like ... and youknow they can get in a boat and drag string through the water and hope fish willfind it ... I mean we have the technology now where we can track the fish downand nuke em if we wanted to ... When I was a kid, when we were hungry weused to drive M-80 into the lake and let the fish come up to the top and gatherthem up and eat them. But we did that coz‘ we were hungry.Here there are places in the world where they are testing nuclear weapons inthe water. If an M-80 kills a fish imagine what a nuclear bomb must do in anatoll! ... the absolute destruction of beautiful marine life to find out if it works. Wealready know it works, right? And we already know that it's gotta be bad.If there are any UFO‘s they gotta be looking at this world in utter disgust: Why isthis planet attacking itself? Here we are bombing ourselves all over the place. Itjust absolutely got to look absurd. We are not attacking another planet, we areattacking ourselves! This is our airsupply, this is our food, soil, and we are justwracking havoc with it, in every way imaginable!And this is all based on the simple fact that people make bad decisions. Andthey make bad decisions when they feel bad. And it's that simple.When they are talking about ethnic cleansing then I doubt that they are trying tocleanse out what they think is bad I think they are trying to cleanse themselves.And the best way to feel good about themselves is to do it for no reason.And the more we make that kind of technology, I mean the kinds of things Iconcentrated on is: I don't think you can leave any part of the human spiritunturned. To me, people have to develop their ability to love, they have todevelop their ability to think. And they have to do them all together, you can'tjust do one thing. You can't just become a great athlete and leave it at that. Ifyou do that you are nothing than a piece of meat. If all you do is learn tobecome a great musician and you don't become a great person you won't haveanything to sing about.So when you said: you're still doing arts and still doing music – of course. Andthis is what I don't see in other people's work that I encourage and install ineverybody I work with, that they should be doing arts. They should be doingmusic, they should be writing, they should be doing all of these things.We should be making renaissance not waiting for it. Coz' it ain't gonna happenunless we do it and do it deliberately. And it‘s only through a great renaissanceof the human spirit that we can begin to get everybody involved. Not a smallgroup of people but everybody. We should be teaching our children aboutchemistry, music, art and literature not about stupid lies that aren't true that weknow aren't true.In my country we're still teaching that George Washington didn't lie. Excuse me,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch7the guy was a bold face liar. The fact that they have a statue of him in Londonshows you how absurd things is. He was the guy who ripped America awayfrom England and they have a statue of him here as a great leader! But they putthat up after we became allies. Because if it wasn't for what America did, I’msure this would be a nice little province of Russia or Germany. Or we would allbe dead.But at that time one of the most stunning things I ever saw was a picture of theUS with German flags on one side and Japanese flags on the other. Thesepeople had incredible fantasies of world conquest, and I don't know about you,to me, I have enough trouble running my own life. The idea that these peopleare obsessed with running everybody else's is beyond me.People have to really learn to get your own house in order. And of course onceyou start to get it in order you start to see all the possiblities of what you can dowith your time rather than think about what other people are doing.We have religious leaders in the US that are obsessed with pornography. And Iwonder how much of their life is absorbed in thinking about it. Here one of thegreatest documents to come out of the U.S. last year was a huge document tocome out about the president of the United States which has more pornographyin it than anything you have ever seen, put out by the biggest religious fanaticaround, this Kenneth Starr.I loved it when Larry Flint came out and offered him a job at Hustler Magazine.He said: ”Never has anybody put so much pornography together so fast in oneplace.”I mean, to me people are so concerned about other people's lives. To me, thisis symptomatic of the fact that people don't have good lives. When people havereally good lives then they make their own life better and then it affects otherpeople in a better way.And this is something that people in the field of NLP have got to learn right outof the gate. Otherwise they're gonna have me to deal with them - still a youngman. They got a lot of years to fuck around with me. Boy, let me tell you.Ronnie: How many people more do you have to train until NLP makes a hugeeffect in the world?Richard: Well I think it's already made a huge effect. As far as I'm concerned Iam flabbergasted. I go all over the world and people already know who I amwhen I get there. I think that's just lovely to tell you the truth. I went to India andI got a better reception in India than I get in my hometown. Not that I get a goodreception there usually. I get a reception when I get home and they say:”Your bills are unpaid and your dog shit on my lawn.”Ronnie: And you can go into every bookshop wherever and you find NLPbooks.Richard: Oh yeah, it's funny we were at the antique market the other day andmy wife was getting a necklace with some beads from India and this womansaid: ”Oh, have you ever been to India?” And I said yes and she said: ”Wheredid you go?” I told her and she said: ”That's a funny place to go to India! Whatwere you doing there, that’s a computer town?””I was teaching hypnosis!”And she said: ”I have a friend who does hypnosis in something that's calledNeuro Linguistic Programming”And my wife said: ”My husband made up Neuro Linguistic Programming”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch8and the woman swung her eye around and looked at me and she went:”Who are you?”We were in a restaurant the other day and somebody came up to the table andasked: ”Excuse me but are you Richard Bandler?”I said: ”I think so, why did you ask?””Oh, I saw a film about you.”But it's funny, to me, when I went to college and that wasn't really that long agoand in my freshman year I took philosophy 102 which is introduction tophilosophy. And a couple of years ago I was sitting in a bar and the bartenderwas reading a book. And there wasn't anybody else in there so I walked over tothe bartender getting a drink and the guy closed the book and it was philosophy,introduction to philosophy. And I said: ”Oh I took that course in college. Whatare you studying, Plato?” And he said: ”No, I am studying somebody namedBandler. Plato is the first quarter and now it's the last quarter.”And now in introductory philosophy courses people are studying me, you knowit goes Korzybski, Bateson, Bandler.And actually in terms of things I mean Robert Anton Wilson's last book wasdedicated to me and my wife. And I find that kind of stuff really to be an honor.Just to be mentioned by somebody like that I think is wonderful. But yeah, I goto the most obscure places on the planet. In Germany we were in Chiemsee.Ronnie: Yes, I was there, too.Richard: Yeah, you remember that little tiny town in the middle of nowhere –Prien. My daughter went in and dropped some film off and the guy looked at thename and said: ”Bandler - you know there is a very famous man by the name ofBandler. He writes books about something called Neuro LinguisticProgramming.” And my daughter looked up and said: ”Yeah, that's my dad!And he went: ”Oh really?””Yeah, he is right over there”.So these people who did not speak a word of English, coz‘ my daughter speaksperfect German. And my daughter brought them that evening and they came inand they sat there for two hours, while I lectured on and on in English. And theyjust sat there nodding and smiling away and then I went up and my daughterintroduced me to them and they rattled away in German. They didn‘t speakEnglish but they didn't care. To me I find that a wonderful attitude.When you consider it was less than fifty years ago my relatives were run out ofthat country, I mean literally. And that the world has changed that much I find tobe an amazing thing. Because they didn’t just run poor people out, they raneverybody out. It was ethnic cleansing at that time. And I am sure that peoplenow ... fortunately the generations have changed enough that this is not theattitude of people in Germany. They are one country that knows the feeling ofwanting something to never happen again. To me that anybody would want toimitate that is so bizarre and that they would be allowed to get away with it isjust too bizarre.And to me it's just always been amazing that through the years I have notencountered any resistance in the field of psychology because people when yougive them something they can use and they can do are delighted with it. Theonly problem I ever find is like you said with the people who have not comeback over the years and have gotten way way behind."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch9Coz‘ I don't move slow. Suddenly they have people come into their classes whoknow more than they do. And so they try and deal with it rather than going:”Hey, I better go back learn something new.” Instead they try to deal with it bysaying: ”No, that's wrong.”I can remember and this was fifteen years ago. There was a time where thatgroup of people got together and tried to get me to agree to never call what I didNLP again. Because they wanted to keep NLP safe from me, because I waschanging it in ways they did not understand. I of course laughed in their face.Inger: They begin to find out that what they are doing will not function in thesociety and that’s an interesting thing because it doesn‘t move. And they arestuck and only have the theory ...Richard: That’s right. ”My ideas are right although I am totally impotent in mybehavior. I understand the theory of sexual intercourse and the fact that Icannot do it does not mean a thing.”We are constantly coming up with new things. Some of the new project is - andthis is one of the reasons why I have recently dealt so much with fear.Because I discovered, that if at the beginning of a workshop I can really changethings in a profound way, if I gave people in the very beginning the ability to turnfear around. Then the more things they were afraid of the more things they haveto learn about - so it's almost like: The worse off you are the better you can get!And it's a funny thing. Coz' once I'll demonstrate how easy this is, I mean it'ssuch a simple phenomenon, that if you take fear and you literally take thephysical sensations, where they begin and how they move, and you literally turnit around so that you can do it in the opposite direction. For some people it‘smoving front to back or back to front. With some it moves from the right to theleft and the left to the right but usually it spins and that is how it's able to stay.Coz' any feeling that continues for a long period of time has to have a way ofsustaining itself. So it has to build a system of movement and primarily thathappens to be rotation. So we take the centerpoint of the rotation flip it upsidedown and have it spin in the opposite direction. And it turns fear into a totallydifferent sensation.And what will happen is: if people keep spinning it, eventhough they are thinking the same thoughts, they’re looking at the same objects,it doesn't matter what it is as long as they can spin it in the opposite direction.What happens is, it moves from a partbody sensation to a whole bodysensation. And that's the point at which people can deal with it, coz‘ whathappens is: it doesn't feel like fear, it feels like determination. And then peoplesuddenly ... coz‘ fear gets you to not learn new things and as soon as it is goneyou start paying attention, and then you begin to see new things, hear newthings and do new things.So the result is: in the past couple of years the students that I have gotten aremoving so much faster than anything I've ver had before. It is phenomenal!They are learning things so rapidly it is absolutely unbelievable.And of course some people are freightened because we do the practitionercourse in seven days. Of course this scares the hell out of them, coz‘ they maketheir money by making taking it a long time. But you see, we haven't run out ofthings to teach. So we don't have to keep the same people around and bleedmoney from them. The other reason that scares them is we haven't made it veryexpensive coz‘ I believe NLP courses all got too costly. That the idea that apractitioner certificate costs 4000 to 6000 £ is absolutely crazy. It shouldn't cost"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch10that much money to get the skills. These are skills that are readily available,easily taught and should be shared with lots and lots of people.It's not like there is a lack of fear on this planet. It's not that there is a lack ofstupidity on this planet and it's not like there is any shortage of crazies.But to me it's such a good marketing thing. It's such important stuff. You have tolearn it real slow. Unfortunatey thiat‘s not what it is about: It's about learningfast! You should be able to learn it fast. But they don't do installation. You see,this is the problem. If as a teacher you do not install the right learning strategiespeople can not learn quickly. So therefore it takes them forever to explain itand for people to learn it by doing it over and over again.But they come out of these courses they come in and I say: ”What do you do ifsomebody says they're depressed?” and then they go: ”About what?” and that'snot what you ask! If you start with the smallest chunk and try to get to thebiggest chunk that's like building a pyramid by putting all the small things at thebottom and all the big blocks on the top. It's just fucking stupid and it won‘twork. Everything will fall down. You know you put the big pieces at the bottomand you build on top of it with the small pieces. When I get down to saying:”about what?” I want to have good results coming out of it. I don't care whatthey are depressed about, it's all the same thing. And I don't care how theydepress themselves, either. Coz‘ I don't want to depress anybody else. To me, Iwanna know how they are aware that it is going on and I want to reverse theprocess.Part of what I was telling you when that taperecorder went sour was about thisoperasinger. And what a guy this was and what a memory I have!Here is a guy who has gone through all the trouble to learn a skill. He is verygood at the skill. But when he starts to do it in front of other people he lacksconfidence. So in his infinite wisdom after having two years of NLP-training - bythe way he hadn't become a practitioner yet. This was a three year trainingprogram. The first nine months they spent on the metamodel.He sat down with me. He said: ”It took me a long time to make the decisison tohire you but no one else I felt could help me.” And I said: ”Well, are you prettyconfident about that?” and he went: ”Oh yes!”And I said: ”Good! Are you sure you feel confident about that?”And he said: ”Oh, absolutely!”And I said: ”When you feel confident where does the feeling start?”And he said: ”I beg your pardon?”And I said: ”Look, you told me you felt confident. You weren't lying to me, wereyou?”And he said: ”No, I feel confident.”And I said: ”When you feel this confidence that I can help you, where does itstart?””Well it's here in my stomach.””And where does it move?””Well,it moves up right. And it‘s as if it goes trough my throat.”And I said: ”How convenient!”And he looked at me and I smiled and I winked at him and he went: ”I knowwhat you are gonna tell me to do!””What?””You're gonna tell me and have this feeling and sing.””Good guess!”He stood up and he sang and he looked at me and said: ”I feel so stupid for nothaving done this before.”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch11And I said: ”Well, are you confident about that?”And he looked at me and went: ”Yeah!”And I said: ”Well good, maybe you should be confident about singing anduncertain about being stupid or else be sure enough to realize the only thingthat makes you smart is this time you realized being stupid.”And he said: ”No no, I can't believe I spent ten thousand $ to learn something Ialready knew!”And I said: ”Well, there is the problem! The problem is not knowing what to do,the problem is knowing when to do it. And it's not that people don't haveconfidence, it's that they don't know how to put it in the right time and the rightplace. They are confident about things they shouldn't be. It's not that peopleshouldn't be afraid it's that they should be afraid of sleeping with their bestfriends wife. And the passion that they feel they should aim in the right direction.I think the smartest client I ever had was the one who told me after I've got rid ofa phobia in five minutes .. He said to me: ”I feel 5000 $ in five minutes ....I said: ”If you want it to take five years I can drag it out for five years, noproblem.You wait here for five years and I come back and do it in five minutesbut that’s not gonna help anybody. How much time have you wasted on this sofar? Look, I still have two hours before my plane leaves. Now, can you think ofsomething else you would like?”And he said: ”Now what I would like is everytime I see my wife, everytime I talkto her on the phone I'd like to be more in love”And I went: ”Oooh, that sounds good!”And about six months later I was teaching a seminar and everybody in it waslaughing and that woman in the seminar was scauling at me. And the first breakshe walked up to me and started poking me in the chest and she goes: ”Youowe me!”And I said: ”I owe you?”And she said: ”Yes, my husband came and saw you in Louisianna in the airport.Do you remember him, the guy with the problem, the phobia of peoplecoughing?”And I said: ”Yeah?”And she said: ”Well, he's so happy it makes me sick! And you are either gonnado the same thing to me or I'm going to be really pissed off at you all weeklong.”And I said: ” What did I do? What did I do?” I couldn‘t even remember.And she said: ”You made it so everytime I talk to him, everytime he looks at mehe is more in love. And I want the same thing. I wanna feel as good as this guyfeels. He is in seventh heaven every day all the time.....”So we had to correct that subtle imbalance but I took that as a request that wasworthwhile. Coz‘ I think people give up on their relationships too easy. Becausethey set up a cycle where things keep getting worse. And I‘m making things sothat they can continue to get better and things don't stay at a level. Humans arevery unstatic and just like feelings are very unstatic. That's why in order tomaintain fear it has to have a place where it moves and that's what makes it soeasy to change. If you turn it upside down it spins in the opposite direction. A lotof the thrust of my work has been to remove fear and then to make people to bemore determined, to not accept feeling bad.I think people feel bad and when it reduces that's an acceptable thing to them.But they don't realize if you're looking for where it's feeling bad it will always end"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch12up feeling worse - that you can get rid of this phobia, you just put another one inits place. But until you really start aiming towards pleasure and make yourselfso that it is something you are constantly doing that it's an activity that it's notsomething that is a result.People work their whole lives so that they can retire. They work their whole livesand then they die the minute they retire because they don't know how to enjoythemselves anyway. People have to learn to enjoy just about anything and oncethey do that they can move on and learn anything.People told me once when I worked with an assembly line. They had one part ofthe assembly line that just jammed up and they had three times as many peopleas they thought they needed. All it was was putting in one pin. They put in thepin and hit it with this thing and flattended the pin out on the other side. It justcould not have been more boring. They kept having to add more and moresections to this because it kept slowing down. Literally the amount they wouldgo through per hour would reduce. They would put twice as many humanbeings on and they would end up getting half as much output. And they saidthey just thought it was too boring and they just didn’t know what to do.And I went in and I sat there and I looked at it and I said: ”I have an idea.” So Itook half the people off just to start with. And then I went in and I made it sothey all did it together instead of doing it separately. And they all pushed thishandle together and I taught them a song that I literally recorded on a boomboxand it went krrrrbababababoooom ... And I had em sing this song and do thisthing.And what happened was really funny. They started doing this and then I didn’tbring the boombox. They just did it on their own, they started speeding up thetempo and the output was phenomenal. They actually ended up changing itfrom what I had to the point where they actually putched twice as often as I hadit in the tune. And they were going tschtatatattschoohtaoohta and they wereoutputting stuff faster. But what happened oddly enough is it spread to eitherside of a line and started speeding up, even though they weren’t doing thesame activity. And then it spread through all this thing.And I came back a year later. The seven people that I had working thereweren’t there anymore. They were all in management positions in the samecompany. But yet, they were still singing the same song in the same place. Andthe output of the entire assembly line went up two and a half times as a directresult. People were just flabbergasted. They said we don‘t know what you did.We know you had them sing a song. But we don’t know what else you did.And I said: ”Well, all I did was make it feel good to push that lever Becauseeverytime I had them push that lever I fired an anchor off that made them allfeel good. And what made it so they wanted to do it more ... once they startedfeeling good about going to work ... just the idea of driving there. They had putthe song in their head they would feel good about getting there, right? And theydidn’t make it so they never wanted to improve themselves. It just made it sothey enjoyed the place where they worked. So they started caring about thecompany more. They started caring about all aspects of it more. So it doesn’tsurprize me they ended up in management positions. Because they wantedeverybody to feel as good about the company as they did.They’ve gotten carried away, now they have profit sharing plans. And thecompany is doing probably ten to fifteen times the busines they were doing five,six, seven, eight years ago."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch13I mean to me, one little change produces massive results. And it’s a simpleidea.. If you take something and it's rolling down a hill if you bump it over onelittle tiny centimeter, like this, the angle. By the time it gets to the bottom of thehill it will be way the hell over here. And so it takes just a small amount but youhave to make sure you aim it in the direction you wanna go in. This is theproblem that people go in and start randomly doing things. That's why they'realways talking about ecology. You never hear me talking about ecology coz‘that's not a problem I have. Because when I make changes I make sure thatthey are methodical that they are directed and that they're something that iseverybody going to make feel better.I don’t do this: I don’t make it so people can stand up for themselves and tortureother people, the kind of thing you were talking about. You don’t need to makeanybody feel bad in order for you to feel good.I’ve had people who said: ”You know, I’ve been in assertiveness-training forseven years and I still can‘t stand up and tell a waitress she is taking too longand yell and scream at her.” And I always say: ”Well, you should be grateful.Otherwise you get one of those oysters on your salad right out of the nostril.Being mean to others should not ever be the foundation of people feeling good.”The foundation of feeling good should be just that you know how it is done. Andif you get up in the morning and make yourself feel good and make it feel likethe world is filled with possibility and lots of choices and head yourself in thatdirection by the end of the day you’ll feel a thousand times better. But if you getup in the morning and you go: ”Oooh shit, what’s gonna go wrong today?” It willprobably be within moments that you’ll be in there in the toilet and you won’t beable to shit. It will go from there and even worse.April 8thRonnie: The raiders of the lost interview are here again. This morning was likemental archeology. About fortyfife minutes of the interview we took yesterday isrecorded and we shared stories and wrote down stuff trying to reconstruct whatyou have said yesterday.But there were some interesting lines running in my mind and there was alsosome amnesia running around those lines.Richard: Mmmh, there was some amnesia? I remember the amnesia but notwhat it was about.Ronnie: Yes, and somehow we shared the amnesia.Richard: Oh shared amnesia that’s always good.That is why we tape thesethings.Ronnie: That’s good. But there is only feedback and no failure - as long as youget a second chance.Richard: Well, it's my firm belief in life that with most things you always get asecond chance.Ronnie: This makes life after death a plausible solution."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch14Richard: Well, my tombstone is gonna say: To Be Continued, that's for sure.Ronnie: One thing that I remember about the lost interview yesterday was:you gave us an example of working with someone. You said that you workedwith the person then you smiled and then you said: ”Of course this isnonsense!” That was your answer to the person's problem. I don't rememberthe exact story. But that's kind of an attitude that I like. So to me, I sometimesthink of NLP as the ultimate homeopathy: it's like treating nonsense withnonsense - but maybe that is taking it a bit too far.Richard: Well, to me most of the time that's what I feel is that I am treatingnonsense with nonsense!One example is: So many times people ask me: what do you think of subliminaltapes? And I did an experiment because I am a firm person in believing ineverything. And if you believe in everything and we made subliminal tapes thathad a hundred thousand suggestions to be stressed out beyondcomprehension, that everything would make you nervous, that everything in theworld was collapsing, everything was going wrong, everything in the worldwould upset you. And then we took them to a place called the Center ForStress. Because it seemed appropriate somehow. And we covered over thesesuggestions with the sound of the ocean and I handed them to the people in thiscourse and I said : ”We are running an experiment and I want you to listen tothese in your car, at home, just constantly for the next month and come back.”And categorically a hundred percent of the people - there were 27 people in thegroup – every single one of them walked in and – coz I told them they had togive the tape back and it could not be duplicated – and everyone of them camein and said they weren't giving the tape back, that they had had the best monthin their entire live.Now what this really means is when I handed them the tape I told them it was arelaxation tape. Now which means - one lie is more powerful than a hundredthousand suggestions that you can absolutely not hear. Which means if youcan't hear it it don't fuck with you.Now, I've seen subliminal tapes taken to the nth degree. I actually saw they hada subliminal tape for birthcontrol with a money back guarantee. Now, I don'tknow about you guys, but if I got pregnant I wouldn't be thinking about gettingback my fourteen dollars and ninety five cents but I would be rather angry.I even think that anybody who tries to use a tape for birthcontrol needs morethan a birthcontrol tape. I think what we are talking about is a learning disability!But yet this is the kind of stuff that I hear all the timeI am not exactly sure which case you were talking about treating nonsense withnonsense, because they all seem like that to me.They always seem like when people come in and say ”I am depressed” and Isay: ”Every moment of your life you are depressed or just at this moment rightnow?” And they go: ”Well, right now” and I start tickling them right out of thegate. And they start to laugh and then I anchor it. And then with everything theysay I fire the anchor and they'll laugh and I say: ”You seem like a pretty chewyguy!” Then I know what’s going to happen. They say: ”Now, I am having fun.But when I look back on it I wont have really been having fun.” So I go: ”Ooh, soyou can take anything you want and distort it into something that isdepressing?”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch15And when I discovered that it wasn't that depressives didn't enjoy themselves, itwas that they remembered everything in a depressive way. It seems to me thatthat is truly nonsense to take all the fun things in life and squash them into apicture of depression.To me when I told you about the guy who was an operasinger, this is a guy whocomes in with absolute total certainty and tells me about his lack of confidence.I mean, this is always what I hear with people when I have somebody whocomes in and tells me that they are always like a rug, everybody walks on them,they can't say no to anyone. Then I went: ”Really?” Coz‘ the minute I hear this Ihear the solution: I say really: ”Well tell me no! And then they said no they can'tdo that. Then I said: ”You just did!” and then they go: ”Oooh!””What did you think would happen if you said no to people?” and they said:”Well, I don't know (pronounced no).””See, you said it again! Right, now you are telling me you know you can't say noand you already said it in a sentence!””Well, not that kind of no!” and I said: ”Well, that's the kind you really need.Youneed the kind of knowing that you can say yes or no because you know: onetakes you one way one takes you the other but if you say you can't say no thento me I think I've got you right there.”I mean, to me, now tell me this is not nonsense! Because I know that peoplewho tell me they can't say no are saying: ”No no no I can't say no!”And that's what I hear them saying, they are saying: ”No no no no, I never sayno and noone is gonna make me.”To me I say my clients walk in with the solutions and if you really listen to themthey are there.Now I've heard tragic stories, but to me it again boils down to what the DalaiLama said. The tragedy is not that usually terrible things happen to people –they do. Imagine now half a million people without their homes and theirbelongings and their fotografs and their papers stuck in box cars and terrified.Are these people gonna have to relive this every day for the rest of their livesbecause they go to a psychologist? That's even worse to me than what's doneto them in one day or over night. If they do to get back to their homes theyshould get to go back to their whole lives.And I've worked with holocaust victims and it's absolutely incredible stories theytell. It wrenches my heart because I know my relatives died there. But there isno reason on this earth that those people have to relive this over and overagain.If you are raped then once is enough. And I don't believe you have to gothrough the tragedy of reliving trauma in order to get on with their lives. In fact itis the reliving of them that keeps their lives from going forward.It strikes me as totally insane that people have come to me and told me theyhave been trough these nightmares every night they've relived these tragedies.And I've said: ”How long have you been in therapy?” Some of these people hadbeen in therapy for twentyfive, thirty, forty years, that's a lot of damned therapy.And when I asked them what did they have you do? They take them back intohorrible situations, they have them relive it. And it doesn't do them a damned bitof good and they do it over again. To me, this is another form of torture.To me, I've done some of the most idiotic things: When they brought me thatpoor young man, he was working on a car on a pickuptruck and the jackslipped. He broke his back and the doctors looked at him and what did they sayto him?: ”You're never gonna walk again. You might as well get used to it.”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch16This means they are not only doctors they are now clairvoyants. What do youmean he'll never walk again. There is more than one way to walk. Good god,there are people who have their legs chopped off and they walk again! Theymake them prosthetics. And they say to me: ”Well, those people haven't hadany damage to their spine.” And I say: ”Scuse me, if you have your legschopped off I think there is a bit of a problem!”My son worked for years making prosthetics for people and the major problemwas: there is only two important parts of doing it. One is to realize howunpleasant it is to have a pebble in your shoe. So they have to be perfect inorder to feel like a part of you. And the other one is that they need to look like apart of you. Coz‘ they make them out of white fucking plastic and I have neverseen anybody quite that white and I've met some really white people.I met albinos. I played in band with one for years. What he did when he hadblack children, he made them black legs. And the guy that he worked for hadbeen making prosthetics for sixty years. Coz‘ he got this job walking down thestreet waiting for a bus and this old man looked at him and he said: ”What areyou doing out in the middle of the day. Don’t you have a job?”And he said: ”I am looking for one. My dad told me: don’t get a job until you findthe right one.” So the old guy asked my son: ”How do you feel like making armsand legs?” And my son looked at him and said: that sounds like a cool thing todo.” And he always liked to do things that are artistic.To me everybody is looking for solutions to come in align with somebody‘stheory about what's right and what's wrong and how it should be. We triedinsight therapies for years and they just don't work. It's a nice idea that if youunderstand your problem it would go away. However I understand a lot of theproblems of the whole world and they don't go away. You can understand yourfinancial problems and that doesn't help them a bit does it? You still have to goout and make more money. That seems to be the only solution around.To me, it's a funny thing that people tell me they lack motivation and wheneverthey say it to me they say: ”I just can't get motivated.”And I look at them and I go: ”You are motivated to tell me this?”This is immediately what crosses my mind. I go: Aha, it's not that they lackmotivation because they have it, you know. If they lacked motivation theywouldn't get out of bed, they wouldn't be sitting in front of me, they would juststop breathing. That's what somebody who lacks motivation does: they taketheir breath in and they just hold it. It's too much trouble to let the damned thingout and that would be it. They die.But I tell you they never lack motivation to go to the bathroom. That's a funnything. I sit there and start to throw out hypnotic suggestions just to be sure.They'll be sitting there and I start saying: ”Well, maybe you are not fluid enoughin your approach. You know, sometimes if the pressure is put on in just the rightway ....” and the next thing you'll know is you watch them and their teeth willstart floating. And the next thing that happens is that they‘ll go: ”Can I use yourrestroom?”And I go: ”Naaa, don't bother.”And they'll go: ”No really, have to go!””I thought you were not motivated?” and they go: ”This is biological” and I go:”So is happiness! Happiness is as biological as it gets and if you are notmotivated to go out and do things that make you more successful just keep thepiss inside you! That’s that.”And they say to me: ”That's nonsense!” and you know what? I am proud of it!"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch17I yield out some of the best nonsense around!The guy I told you about that the truck fell on, here is a kid and the doctors tellhim: Oh, we're not just doctors, we're clairvoyants, we know you'll never walkbecause you have a spinal injury. So I walk up to him. He's sitting in awheelchair and I said on stage: ”I really want to tell all you doctors who broughtthis kid in”, all they wanted to do is to see if he could lift himself up and wipe hisown ass because they were tired of this. That other quadraplegics ... I love thatword ”quadraplegic”, makes you sound like some kind of prehistoric turtle - hewasn't a quadraplegic, he was a man, and men are entitled to have pride anddignity.This is one of the worst things about what they are doing to the people over inKosovo. They are robbing them not just of everything but of their dignity. Coz‘once you take people's dignity it's a hard thing to return.This is what heroinaddicts loose. You can always get them to stop taking heroinbut to get them to reestablish because after they violated their ownbeliefsystems. And stolen from people that they know they shouldn't and donethings, and been able to justify it because they are a drug addict. After that youcan justify anything. They break their moral structure and that's the thing thatnever gets repaired in these programmes. They make it sound like it is cool tobe a junkie they put them with other junkies and they can stop taking the drugsbut they‘re still a junkie they are a junkie for what they are doing. They put themin places, like in the U.S. they used to have Simenon (?) They’ve got such acult. They ended up putting snakes in people's mailboxes and thinking that waso.k. Well, they could think anything was o.k because as long as they were in apack like dogs they can do just about anything. But I don't believe that cultsshould have more than one member. Now, I know that sounds like nonsenseagain. But it is the solution.If everybody makes up their own moral structure and abides by it we'd be a lotbetter off. Because people wouldn't be able to steal. Because if they saidstealing was o.k. then everyone would be allowed to steal from them.That'swhat the sign would say. O.K., your a thief, open the house!Everytime he's gone everybody in the world is allowed to steal from this person.Sounds like nonsense but it would work. If you were caught stealing that meantthey would put on your house a big sign and everybody was welcome to stealyour belongings. These people would learn what it feels like to be violated.Because when somebody's house is robbed one of the worst things thatmattered is not the objects that are gone but the sense of violation that peoplehave that they loose their dignity, that somehow their own space and world getsviolated in that way.These people that were on the stage were violating that young man's dignityand this pissed me off. I said: ”To whether he'll walk again or not, this I don'tknow. But I would like to tell you all that I think you are a bunch of fuckingassholes!” And here's a thousand people in the audience they all gasped. Hewas a very famous surgeon who couldn't help this young man and he was justtrying to do this for this boys own good. How dare I call him an asshole.But do you know who clapped? The man in the wheelchair who wasn't even onthe stage. They had him out in the wings to see, you know.

Now this isabsolutely nonsense to do this. And he looked at me and asked: ”Why did youdo that?””Coz‘ I have a question. Did you feel that?” And he said yes. So I kicked himagain in the other foot and I said: ”Could you feel that?” and he said: ”Yeah!””Do you know where the floor is?” He said yeah. And I said: ”Now, do you knowthe difference between the inside and the outside of your foot?” and I walkedover and looked at him.”Are you gonna kick me again?””Only if I have to.”If I have to kick somebody I have no problem with that. I mean I've done sillythings to clients.To them as far as they were concerned their life was on theedge of things but it was just to show to them that it wasn't.I had one guy who said that no way in the world he ever wanted anyone totouch him and he said this was aproblem coz‘ he was married and he had thiswhole thing about being a compulsive.To begin with he couldn't even go to abathroom in a public place. He was in New York so of course I told him I couldonly see him in Houston and he literally went to the bathroom and got on anairplane, brought his own food, flew with four or five other people all the way toHouston, came into the hotel and I showed up three hours late.I was already there but when I walked in he said: ”I don't want anyone to touchme” and I said: ”Let me show you something” and I went and opened up thewindows of the doors, coz‘ I picked the room particularly for him, opened up thefrench doors, grabbed him like this and walked up and held him out over thebalcony and asked: ”Now, do you want me to let go?”And he was grabbing on to me like something you've never seen in your lifeand I said: ”Don't touch me!” and he went: ”Aaah!” when I left him over thebalcony. He pulled his arms around me and just held on.I said: ”Good, now that that problem is out of the way what else do you want?”In my room it had a little sign that said if you‘re missing anything: ask thebellman.He said he washed his hands constantly but couldn't brush his teeth.I said: ”I tell you what I wanna do. I send you on a journey. I want you to godownstairs and I want you to ask the bellman where you can go and get atoothbrush, some toothpaste, some toiletpaper and things coz‘ you're gonnaneed them.” And he went downstairs and he walked up and asked the bellmanand the bellman reached underneath, handed him toothbrush and toothpaste,and he was shocked. He didn't even know this person but since he hadn't beenout much he didn't know this kind of thing happened. And he said when hecame upstairs: ”The gentleman downstairs just gave me these things.”And I said: “What did you do?””I shook his hand and said thank you.””Really?””And he was even black!””Was it any different than shaking my hand?”And he went: ”No?!””Now, think how many hands are out there you haven't shaken?”See, it's just like this kid. When there was somebody in the audience, and I hadnoticed this right off, that had the same kind clutches, the kind that has thatthing that goes around your wrist and it has a handle and I've seen lots ofpeople walk with these things."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch19Fortunately I was misinformed coz‘ I hadn't really asked. But apparently if youyou have spinal injury of this nature you cannot walk with these. Apparentlythey're not good enough. In other words that's not supposed to help youbecause you're never supposed to be able to walk. Apparently this is what thedoctor said.However I figured if you knew where the inside of your foot was versus theoutside, as long as your legs didn't slip out then if they're sticking down that I'veseen people swing their legs forward together or walk with them individually andall kinds of weirdassed things. I didn't realize that they can do that but that theyhave to have some other problem than a spinal injury. Apparently some of themdidn't know either because some of the people I know who walk are with thoseinjuries. They were just misinformed and were walking when they shouldn't be.But apparently they didn't have enough medical training to know what theirproblems were and what their limitations should be. I explained this to thisyoung kid and I explained it to the audience. And I asked the guy if I couldborrow his crutches. He threw them up on the stage and I took them and walkedover and I said: ”Now, these are a little short for you. But let's give em a try” andI gave it to him. And I said: ”Now, I don't know what it's gonna take to get you upbut if I have to kick you in the ass I'll do that, too.”And he just smiled and put them on and went like this and he lifted himself upand he walked over. And I said: ”I thought you couldn't walk and he said: ”Me,too!” And I said: ”Well, it turns out we were wrong.”And I turned around and I looked at the doctor and the doctor turned beadredand started yelling at me in front of a thousand people. He said: ”You thinkyou're such a smart ass!” And I said: ”No, I don't. I think my ass is as stupid asanybody else's. The only difference is I know it.”And this is the nonsense: to be able to decide what other human beings areincapable of is got to be one of the stupidest things anybody can do.And that's true for me and that' true for anybody.If a client came in and I was trying to figure out what was impossible for themI mean this is absolutely crazy.I had one kid who came in who was told quite frankly that he would never beable to learn to read and write that he had some mysterious thing I've nevereven heard of it. They said he was crosshemisphered. We're allcrosshemisphered, aren't we? But apparently this is some new learning-disability-diagnosis. Another piece of mumbojumbo which doesn't tell youanything about what to do about it, except not try! They wanted me to hypnotizehim and make it so that he would accept since he couldn‘t read that he wouldhave to use these books which were read on to tape and stuff. And he seemedto be an absolutely uncooperative young man because he would not accept hislimitation. He kept continually trying to read and he wasn't a young boy. He hadbeen in the military and get this: he worked at a whirlpool. He could put anengine together and put it back together! Blindfolded!And I said: ”Jesus Christ, I can't even find my carkeys half the time, let alone dothat. I gotta to find out what's going on here. This does not make any sense tome.”So I kicked his ass into the deepest trance I could and I told his unconscious Iwanted him to just bring back into his mind what it is that brought this into beingbut not his conscious mind coz‘ he didn't need to know about it. He needed toknow that it wasn't true that whatever was stopping him. And suddenly he satup and looked me straight in the eyes in a deep trance like this and he went andhe said: ”Teacher told him.” and I asked when and he said: ”Five years old -teacher told him never learn - crack pencil in front of his face!”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch20He referred to himself in the second person closed his eyes and fell overbackwards. I brought him out of trance and asked: ”What happened?”And he said: ”What do you mean what happened, we haven't started yet.”And I went: Mmmh, little amnesia there!So I walked around the room picked up a pencil and walked over to him andsaid: ”It's time to start learning and snapped the pencil in front of his face.”Now tell me this is not nonsense!And suddenly he looked at me and you could see the facial changes in front ofhis face. And everything in his neurology went whacky and suddenly he lookedat me and he went: ”I feel different!” And I said: ”Do you? and I handed him abook and he picked it up and he could read. He already knew how to read. Hewas just operating out of a posthypnotic suggestion from one of those reallyinherently helpful people who got frustrated when he was a young kid and hecarried this posthypnotic suggestion a little too far.I think this is true in most cases. I find this is part of the nonsense that goes on.It's not that humans can't learn, it's that they learn too much too quickly. And Ifind this to be nonsense.I find now that I've heard so much of it that when people start telling me theystart hearing how much nonsense it is, too. Because I don't go: Oooh, howterrible! I usually look at them like: Excuse me?? And then I ask those funnyquestions because to me, I understand the metamodel and I understand thatmost people teach it a little differently than I do. To me for instance I find”when”-questions to be the most important that when people tell me: ”I'mdepressed” I go: ”When?” Coz I don't really wanna know about what and I don'twanna know how they depress themselves. Because I don't really wannadepress anybody else. That's not what I'm after.It's just when I talked to you yesterday about schizophrenia: To me that's too biga word. We need smaller words that tell us about each kind of thing. There aremany forms of people not being in touch with reality and this is where I go to thegreatest extreme to create nonsense.I mean sometimes it's like the woman I told you about yesterday who thepsychiatrist was the one who had the answer. Coz‘ the schizophrenic wasschizophrenic because she didn't know. I mean if you can't tell the differencebetween remembered images and fantasies and you don't know which onesreally happened. And it seemed to me pretty apparent because all she keptdoing was asking people: ”Did I do this?” and they said no. But it didn't convinceher. Because she still didn't have a way to know which ones were which. Whenshe thought about a memory and she thought about something she created inher mind. But now they're both memories and they both look the same. So byhaving her put black border all around the ones that are created. Now this is theway the psychiatrist did it, because when I asked him how he was able to tellthe difference between what was real and what was not real this was hisanswer. And it seemed like a good answer. It's not the way I do it. But it's theway he did it. And it was good enough for him and it worked for her. To me thisis always the problem: they are always studying the wrong thing to find out.To me when you asked me yesterday what's the kind of things I am looking atnowadays I decided that if I started out doing things the first thing that I reallyconcentrate on is getting rid of people's fears. Because with fears, you're onlyborn with two of them. You have the fear of loud noises and the fear of falling.Everything else is learned. Children will crawl into a fire – once. And they'lleither die or they'll learn. And unfortunately or fortunately - as the case may be -nowadays we learn to be afraid because someone tells us to. Becausesomeone scares us before we do things."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch21If the child crawls towards the fire the mother screams: ”Aaah, don't do that!” sothe kid doesn't get burned. But it learns to be afraid of anything because theysimply scare the kid and associate those things together. And kids are so goodat learning it they become afraid of everything. It's phenomenal they becomeafraid of speaking their mind. They confuse words with things so much theythink that words are gonna kill. And it's not words that kill - it's tonality that doesit. If you have any doubt about that I can introduce you to a few people. There issome people their tonality is so horrible, and what is really horrible is the effect ithas on the people who learn from them. And people learn from their teachers,they learn from their parents, they learn from relatives all these people who lovethem who don't want them to be hurt. Because people don't do the simple thingthat we do.Like I had to take my computer in and had my harddisk cleaned off because itwas a mess. It got to the point where I had dumped so much in there that mycomputer couldn't even tell that he had a CD-ROM Player in the machine.It wasn’t external, it was internal. And I turned it on and it would show whichthings were there and it wouldn‘t recognize anything on the outside and it didn’teven know half of what it had on the inside. You would pull up programmes andit wouldn’t even have the words that were there. They were translated into totalgibberish, symbols and stuff. Everything had leaked on to everything. I had somany errors on the thing it was beyond repair.So you wipe the harddisk clean and you reload the initial software and you savethe things that you want onto a disk and then you put them back on carefully sothat they're ordered.Well, humans don't do much of that kind of thing. They don't go through andupdate their learnings. They don't so to speak pull out the memories taht aregood that they wanna keep and get rid of the garbage. And part of the reason iswe are not so much a read/write system. We are an archival system, that is: allthe memory that is there always will be there!You can always hypnotize people no matter what happened and have themrelive traumas and they'll be just as bad as they were. And it doesn't matter howmuch therapy they've had . The anger never goes away, the fear never goesaway. Humans are capable of an infinite amount of everything. But what theyseem to practice is feeling bad. And to me the trick is to teach them how tospend more time every day feeling good about good things. Not feeling goodbecause they are better than other people, not feeling good for any otherreason other than they are capable of it neurologically! Coz‘ the more you feelgood the more your unconscious moves in that direction. Unconsciously youdon't have a criterion that says things are good or bad. Coz‘ feelings are justfeelings. They are just chemistry. You are a big chemistry set. And what wehave to learn is to deal with things.I said in the structure of magic which was my thesis that I was gonna do threethings. I was planning to do them all in the book but it's taken me thirty years toreally get down to most of them because I'm kind of a rigorous detailed littlething. A lot of people look at me as being quite flaky but in my own way I alwaysget where I'm going. But I always like to run through all the avenues on the way.I'm not the kind of person who goes in and goes directly anywhere. To me, I gothrough but I wanna make sure that while I'm going where I think things shouldbe, that if along the ways I don't, I find out.Because a lot of times what happens is: when people find out they‘re going thewrong way they don't stop going that way. They don't think they are wrong, they"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch22don't think it's possible for them to be wrong. So they keep going that way eitherlouder, faster, harder or whatever.And if you turn the lights off in a room and you run to get out of it you'll hit awall. Now if what you do is you back up and you run faster eventually you'llknock yourself out. If on the other hand you start to feel your way around you'llfind that magic thing called a door.Years ago when I was interviewed and John was interviewed and we were noteven interviewed together. And one of the first things they did is they misquotedJohn and said that I've said it. John said if there was someone who could walkthrough a wall we could model it and make it so that other people could do it.And I know what John meant when he said that. When the article came out itsaid with bold letters: ”Richard Bandler claims: NLP can teach you to walkthrough walls” And the truth is: it can! Because if you can't tell the damneddifference between a fucking door and a wall you're in big trouble! You gothrough the place where the hole is.I had people who came into seminars making an idiot of themselves - as we saynonsense. The nonsense was they go: ”Well, can you make it so that I can walkthrough a wall?” and I said: ”Sure!” and I bring them right up and I put my handon the back of their head and I have them visualize a hole opening up and thenI take them and slam them against the wall. And I'd say: ”You made the hole thewrong color!” I get some of them to do it four or five times. Actually after the firsttime their head hit the wall it was quite easy and then eventually I take themover and I'd open the door and just throw them through, close it and put abroomhandle on the backside.That to me is a funny thing: That people put so much effort into defendingtheories. And I never put any energy into it. And that's why I've gone as far andas fast as I have. All I was looking for was a way to get to the end. And ifanybody knew any way to get to the end, I didn't care what they call it. Whetherthey called it psychotherapy, whether they called it religion, whether they calledit psychic healing, I don't care what the name of it is. All I wanna know is how toget to the end. And I'll cut the rest out of the way really quickly.I am very good at getting rid of the nonsense and sticking with the really purenonsense.Now, to me, I think it's amazing that people can believe certain things and reallyget powerful healing from it. The fact that they can hand people pills that lookalike and one is full of the drug and the other has nothing in it. And the oneswithout any in it work eight out of ten times as good as these. I think that's a realcomment on the ones that just look like it.I wanted to put out a product actually called ”Placebo Plus” and I was veryserious about it at the time. We were gonna buy a pharmaceutical company andput out drugs so that you got whatever your painkiller was. It never works thatway with antibiotics, by the way. But with a lot of things like if you had aheadache eight out of ten times a placebo works as well as aspirin. And so wethought, ghee whizz, take eleven. We were first going to put out a productwhere just some of them were placebos but then I thought why bother? Let'sjust give people empty gelaton capsules and we'll color them. So that the redones are for headaches, the blue ones are for this and we gave them a littlebooklet. So you went through the booklet and you looked up ”headaches” and itgave you fifteen different pieces of research and it said: Eight out of ten thisworked as well as the real thing, so take twelve just to be safe! And at thebeginning it told you how to change a belief."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch23Because I think that probably one of the most important things that I've everdone was to find out how people changed a belief, so that it was so strong thatit effected their chemistry and their neurology. It's nothing but the swish patternbut nonthoroughly.To me the difference between the way I teach people to do things and the waythey get distorted over the years is that people take old books, old tapes,distorted learnings. Because if you take thirty people in a room and you say asentence to one and you pass it around by the time it gets to the end it doesn’teven match the first sentence. Usually it doesn‘t get through five people. Theydo this with children as a game but you can do it with adults to prove a point.But yet they think they can take whole years of experience of somebody like meand not even take somebody that I taught. Take somebody who attended a oneor two day course and annointed themselves a trainer and went to somebodywho went to somebody who went to somebody who didn’t go to anybody - andthat they’re still gonna know the same things. No!And it's a shame that they can get away with even using the same words butthis isn’t nonsense this is criminal activity as far as I am concerned. And it’scriminal in the sense that the enduser gets defrauded that when people aretrained and taught the meta model so that somebody goes ”I'm depressed” andthey learn to say ”about what?” Who cares? There's a real relevancy challengefor me in everything.And you always start building the biggest piece and moving to the smallestpiece. In the metamodel the biggest pieces are the ones that are challengesabout consciousness. In fact the metamodel is really designed as a very precisetool.You see, when you ask questions you should already know what theanswers are gonna be because you should know what the next question you'regonna ask is. Because they go in loops of threes. Start on the inside of themodel and you work towards the edge of it or you start on the outside and youwork towards the edge of it. When you ask a question that has to do withchallenging lost performative, so when somebody comes in and says: ”Peoplearen't meant to be happy” and to me, I don't go: ”Happy about what?” I don'tcare! I hear that somebody is making a statement that's not just aboutthemselves and about their own mind. They're making a thing that says: I amsaying this is the case. Only they forget that part. And it sems to me eminentlyimportant and we go: ”Aaah, is this written on the earth or does this come onthe embryo?” To me this is a particular kind of a challenge. I am not challengingthe case that they are saying it's always the case, coz‘ you could challenge theuniversal quantifier. Coz‘ to me, they all go two ways and you have to go thisway and you have to go that way.You have to take people so that they go from the inside of their world so thatthey go right up against their model of the world. And then you have to takethem on the outside and push them so that they end up face to face withthemselves, so that they realize that they are a person who can conceive ofthings outside of their own mind, so therefore they must be able to do them.And on the same token they need to be slammed up against their model of theworld so that their nose is bent against the glass and they're looking out, so thatthey know: hey, this is your edge, you can move it over. You don't have todestroy it, you don't even have to jump into any great abyss. All you have to dois open the particular door that you want.And I find all too often people have agendas that they want everybody tobelieve the same thing. I am not like that. I don't want my clients to be like me"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch24I'm not even sure I want them to like me. Most of the time I just want them tofear me: that it is more unpleasant to come back than it is to face anything intheir own life. Because once they know that something's silly, something veryvery silly, that when they walk in and tell me: I'm so confident that I haven’t gotany confidence.I‘ve had people tell me that they were just wrecked with insecurity. So I go: ”Areyou sure about that?” So that they are certain about their uncertainty. It's alwaysthe thing where they have such a high opinion of their opinion of their lack ofjudgement. So that anybody who comes in and says: ”Well I don't have goodjudgement” then I go: ”Well, you're probably wrong about that.” As soon as I saythat they begin to understand that language is only a way of talking aboutthings. It's not the things itself and language has inherent flaws in it, right? Thefact is that when they go into situations they still feel scared and what they needto do is to start at the very beginning and understand the chemistry set.Because to me, I know much more about the motor cortex and how it works andmuch more about the chemistry set than the people who have even known thenames of all the chemicals. It's not that you know the name of every hormone inthe body, you know that serotonin does this and does that. I‘m just finicky. I liketo know all that stuff but I never tell my clients about it. That's not important forthem to know about it. I might tell the the people I train about it. Coz‘ I wantthem to be educated enough to go out and look and understand this is all weknow about it now. These wonderful scientist are out there digging everythingup for us every day and spewing it now into the internet and into magazines.I think the most important thing for people to become is literate. The more youread the more you find. Sometimes you can read the same book over and overagain and every time you read it you can learn something new. I've even readsome of my own books every once in a while and went: ”How come I didn'tknow that?” Somewhere in the back of my mind it came spewing out but boy I’dbe darned if I have any memory of it.I remember Paul McKenna one time asking me when we were doing a training:I really want you to do that thing I saw you do when we were at Breezy Point,about the immune system. And I remember looking at him and going: ”Whatwas it?” And as he described it to me its sounded totally new. And he wasconvinced I taught it to him, but I don’t know where it came from nor do I care. Ijust went: ”Boy, that’s clever! Yeah, yeah, you go ahead and teach it and I’llwatch.” Whether he dreamed it, whether I did it doesn’t matter. It still was newto me and I’m gonna take it and use it in any way I can.To me, when we get down to the chemistry it requires that people generate achemical change in their body in order to change any state. And we have tostart examining where does this begin and do what you do with any archivalsystem. That when I owned an R&D Company we specialized in archivalmemory. We built holographic memory you know fifteen, twenty years ago.We were storing it 10 to the 12th. They can't even do that yet. We had to throw itout the window because it made everything too cheap.They were sellingmachines for fifty thousand that we were selling for three thousand. And weweren't even manufacturers we were engineers. Anywhere they could store anydot we could store a hundred dots.And all the information is everywhere that's the nice thing about holographicmemory. You can jam a pencil through it and all you loose is a little of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch25brightness just like if take a hologram and you cut it in half you can still see thewhole image. All you loose is part of the brightness.It provided for me an understanding of submodalities a long, long time agoand how they function in human beings.It doesn't matter how many times you attack a memory in a human being thememory is always going to be there.And the fact that Penfield chopped people’s heads open and stuck an electrodein and zapped them and they thought of a particuliar event means nothing! Thatkind of logic would mean that if you opened up the back of your TV and you cuta wire and the picture disappeared that that would be what makes the pictureappear. I mean that’s just goofy logic. And goofy logic does not produce theresults that you need like sequential examination does, that human beings haveto know when to start things and it all goes by too fast.They will always say toyou the following thing: ”It‘s just that I feel ...” and then you go off the back andin front of it.When you use archival memory systems and you wanna change somebodysaddress since it is archival you can't erase anything. So what you have to do isput something in front of it the new address, so they always get the newaddress and then turn away. The old one is still there, you just never get it. It'sjust that simple. And human beings work the same way. When you want newrespones you have to get them in front of the old ones. So that to me it's allabout creating a void and filling it.And there is a special chemical thing that I noticed happened and I noticed thisin my own behavior that when I was required to change and I stuck to my guns.The telephone company gave me a new phone number. I didn't move, I didn'tdo anything. I‘d had the same phone number for years. I was so fussy thatwhen I moved I took my phone number with me coz I liked it. It was one ofthose easy to remember things. But then they came along and they changedthe damned areacodes. And they changed my phonenumber whether I liked itor not. It didn’t matter. I don’t call myself that often. But I would go to the storeand I couldn’t remember what I was doing there, so I’d go call my wife. I’d go tothe payphone and I would dial that old number. And I‘d get furious coz‘ after awhile they wouldn’t even tell you the new number.And one day I pressed that old number I stopped and said: ”I‘m not going to doit this time!” and I started to laugh. And that laughter just like all laughterproduces endomorphines, in other words drugs, for lack of a better term. But it’sthe kind of drugs you are manufacturing in your body all the time. And as soonas you laugh you never make the same mistake. And as soon as I noticed that Iwent hmmm! because it is not enough to precisely follow procedures. You haveto do it in the right state and this requires two things. One: that you go first, inother words you have to change yourself. If you are afraid of heights and youwork with people who you are afraid of heights you're a fucking hypocrite.Now, there are things I’ve gotten people to do that I don’t wanna do.It‘s just simple: I don‘t wanna jump out of an airplane. I did once but it wasn’t myidea. It was one of those things where the military says: ghee, this looks likefun, do it. And they had started with an airplane that was only a foot off theground. And it was only a little fake cockpit coz‘ they wanted you to learn how tojump down and roll on the ground with a parachute. And I didn’t want to jumpout of that. I didn‘t even want to go in a room with that many guys. It was justnot my thing."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch26But if you take the fact that people are capable of producing such crazy thingsas homophobia this drives me nuts. Hey, you know what? Use your mind if theguys wanna date each other this just leaves more girls, doesn’t it? I mean, whyare people afraid of the fact that some guy wants to look prettier. My wife saidthat one day: Why are people so upset when all they wanna do is look a littleprettier. What is the big deal? So if they wanna wear a dress and a wig andmakeup and dance up and down the streets in high heels? Why are people soupset that they are getting baseball bats and beating people unconscious? It’sabsolutely ludicrous. They should look at them and go: Hey this number oneleaves more girls for me. Pat Robertson in the U.S., one of our great religiousleaders, who is so concerned about all the homosexuals and the activities theyare engaging in, well my comment to him is: ”Pat, if you don’t make the picturesin your mind they won’t bother you. It’s just that simple.”I mean I live in San Francisco, these gay guy, man, I got news for you. Whenthey walk up to me they always look at me and they go: ”Ttttt, I’m sorry Richard,you know we’re gonna have to teach you how to dress better.” They‘re alwaystaking little hairs off my shirt, that I can’t even see. But there’s no way in theworld they would wrinkle. I don’t know how people walk around withoutwrinkling. I always go: Jesus, someday I have to learn to not wrinkle.But this kind of fear which gets turned into hate and then turned into anger andthen turned into total stupidity. A little nonsense I can deal with but stupidity Idislike. I dislike when people do things that are idiotic.And it is absolutely idiotic, as far as I am concerned for people to claim that theyare involved in a field and not wanna know how things work and not wanna dothem with the right attitude.To me the right attitude is the one where you have a sense of humor aboutthings. You learn to look at things and as people tell you sometimes very tragicstories you still have to see the part of it that's nonsense.I worked with some people that were kidnapped, they were raped, they werebeaten, they were left for dead, and what did they want me to do? They wantedme to help them because they had total amnesia. They wanted me to get thesepeople to recover a full memory of what had happened to them. And theylooked at these poor scared people in hospitalbeds and in their presence. Theysaid this, not behind closed doors but right smacking in front of them like theywere pieces of meat. And I mean this is one of the things that has driven mecrazy for years.In fact years ago they brought a kid to me and he‘d been hurt when he wasyoung. His father had said this right in front of him. He was standing there andhis dad says: ”Well, he was such a bright child, we had such great hopes forhim until the accident. All we want now for him is to maybe to put his own shoeson and go to the bathroom by himself.” Seems to be a great concern thatpeople have. And I turned around and got furious.

All I had to do was to talk about when people weremistreated in this way.

In fact, if you ask them what's theopposite of talking will tell you: listening. Which means when they're talkingthey're not listening. And those shouldn't be the opposite but a simultaneousactivity.And this should be especially true of people who are experts in any field,especially the one that I made up. It' something were we should just beexploring. I feel like I'm just getting started and there's these people who claimto be authorities. And if I'm not an authority how the hell do they get to be one?That means they should be able to do things I can’t do and I haven't foundmuch of that yet. I haven‘t found much in the books that I didn't do one time oranother.As far as I can tell other than myself and Robert Dilts there hasn't been a lot ofcreative work where people have done new things.Robert's worked a lot with allergies. But I remember starting that years andyears ago. When people told me they had allergies the first thing I would do isgo get what they were allergic to. But then I'd get them in a really good moodand I'd anchor it. And then I had them close their eyes and I'd fire off thatanchor repeatedly and stick whatever it is in front of their face.I had a woman who was so allergic to roses, she said that she would begincoughing and hacking and her eyes would water. And she looked at me andshe said: ”And it wouldn’t bother me except I know that everytime I’m goinganywhere and my husband looks at roses that he feels, bad coz‘ he can’t buyme that kind of flower. And he always feels like it’s not romantic to bring meother flowers”. And she said: ”It would be for me but it’s just something that hasbuilt up over the years.” So I said: ”Well, a rose by any other name is still arose.”Now, what arose in my mind at that time is that what she needed to do is notthat you respond to the substance as an allergy. You have to be in the rightstate to do that. If your normal state of chemistry puts you in a state wherecertain things give you an allergic response, especially airborne things or thingsthat you eat, that’s very difficult to deal with. Because as you are metabolizingthis is a very unconscious thing, especially for people who don’t use their nose.See my big theory is your nose is over your mouth for a particuliar reason.Because if it was over your butt you would only know what you had eaten thatyou shouldn’t eat. And it is over your mouth to tell you how to adjust yourmetabolism so it knows how to digest the food or things to tell you to not put in.I mean it’s not like it‘s on the back of your head, it’s not pointing up. It’s rightover your mouth and that seems like a good place for it.To me people often say: ”Do you believe in god?” And I say: ”Yeah, and in fact Ibelieve in quite a few of them, because I’m willing to believe in anything. And Ialso believe that the organization of the human beings is a methodically builtthing which is pretty useful. To me, it’s nonsense for us not to develop thesethings any further. We’re at a state evolutionarily where we can go further bymaking our mind do certain things.Anyway, what else did you wanna know about? Did I miss anything?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch28Ronnie: Yesterday you mentioned that a lot of wisdom has been around and itgot lost, like Rasputin and other wise people ...Richard: Especially when it comes to writing. When you think how many bookshave been written. And that a hundred years ago most books when they gotpublished it was amazing if even a hundred maybe two hundred copies gotmade. And that was it and off they went. Since I’ve been here in Londonwhenever I have a break between courses and stuff my wife and I get on thetrains and go out and find some place in the middle of nowhere. She goes andlooks at all the wonderful things that are there and I go into all the mustybookstores I can find and crawl around in the back and find things and then thetwo of us sit at night and weed through them and find all the good pieces ofinformation.You have to understand that to me - just because they divided fields up doesn’tmean that you should remain ignorant of other things. Everything that peoplestudied about everything, whether it was how to build architecture. There aremany things, the study of catastrophe-theory which is how you build bridgesand buildings.There are a lot of things like sheetmetal that bend and then they go right back.But there is also a point at which you bend them they never go back. Which isnot a good or bad thing. It’s a bad thing if it is a bridge, it’s a good thing if youwanna build things which have shape. Coz‘ it means you can take sheetmetaland put around something that is square and it stays perfectly square. It justrequires a certain amount of force and a certain amount of velocity and it willtake shape and it will never go back.You have to melt it down into metal to startall over again. There is no way once you reach the point of catastrophe. Nowthat set of mathematics has nothing to do with anything. But yet I use it becauseI believe in anything that human beings have thought about has to do withhuman beings. Period.Poetry, art, music, everything all of the things and all of the wisdom. They don’ttalk about people like Salvador Dali as being someone who is a philosopher. Hewas somebody who wrote about art. But everything he said about art was aboutseeing, it was about understanding what you see and it was about how to makerepresentations and to me this is true whenever we‘re talking about the way inwhich people design things: civil engineers. Most people have not gone andstudied civil engineers. I studied it because I think it’s about human beings. Theidea about how you hallucinate roads that aren’t there and then go and markthem out so people can build them, I think that’s phenomenal. This is aphenomenal skill to be able to look through and measure something that isn’tthere. I still consider it a phenomenal thing. I became fascinated with how theymake topographical maps. The idea that they measure something in the sky insuch a way that they know the depth of everything. They don’t just go throughand take pictures. They know how high everything is, up and down and whatthe location is. And they do it by lining up certain points from a distance and it isthe relationship. So they take the picture from this point and from that point andby the difference between the two they can actually calculate all this marvellousinformation.We tried once using it to being able to determine the relationship. In other wordswe actually used the same thing to tell where pictures had been taken from. Inother words we reversed the process. We looked at regular photographs andwere able to actually compute exactly were the picture was taken from byreversing the process. We went to the places where the pictures were shot. Weused these dots they use on to the surface that the picture was taken from. And"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch29once the dots were there we were able to compute were the camera was wherethe picture was taken, so that we could go back and look at it from that point ofview. Coz‘ I wanted to see something that somebody saw when they took apicture. When we went there there was no way we could see it coz‘ you had tohave the angle absolutely perfect.One of the things I learned making holograms - which I think was probably oneof the most profound things of all - was that when you make a hologram you getnine of them on a plate. This is a laser hologram. So when we find the mainhologram which is the one where the object was ... so if you put a coin backhere and you put a glass filmplate here and you exposed it ... you put light onthe coin and the light that is dispersing off the coin. You take half the beam andyou have it so it collides with that light. That’s called a reference beam. So thelight from the object shines into the reference beam and it disperses onto thefilm, this is called the Fourier pattern.Now, the Fourier pattern isn’t like a picture. Coz‘ a picture when we look at it weall see it. But the Fourier pattern when you go through and you shine the laserthere, when you lift it you put the plate right back where it was and you lift theobject out, the object is still there. You still see the object. It’s like the coin looksexactly like the coin. You can’t tell it apart. When people stick their fingerthrough it it’s a real hallucination.Now, what is really amazing is you take the same plate off and you tilt that plateyou’ll also find eight other holograms on it. There is one at an angle over hereand one over here. So if you turn it so that the reference beam is at just the rightangle you can see this.There are also some which are supposed to be real images that are virtualimages. These are in front of the plate. So that here is the plate, here is theobject. People can not see them until you show them where it is. Once they cansee it they can never not see it again. It’s a permanent learning. They canalways take a holographic plate after that and find the one that is in front. Andwhen they see it they can’t not see it. They’ll turn it and it’s always there. Andit’s a funny thing because they can’t see it at all. And all you have to do to teachthem is put your finger on the glass plate and tell them to watch. And you moveyour finger out to where the object is. The minute they focus their eyes in theright place.Coz‘ we as human beings focus our eyes on glassplates and look what’soutside of the window. That’s just the way we are trained to do. We don’t seeobjects that are inside. We don’t look at the glassplates to see what’s in front ofthem, right? Since we are so trained to do that.You know what is really odd is when they found some tribes that had not beenexposed to civilization at all. They had to teach them how to see through glass.Coz‘ it turns out humans can’t do that. It’s a learned phenomenon. When youlook out the window what happens is your eye picks a pinpoint on the glass.You don’t actually see through it but you actually know what must be on theoutside because all the light is bouncing off of the buildings and bouncing off ofthe windows and it creates a Fourier pattern.That‘s how they figured out how to make holograms. Because somebody wassitting there and figured you can’t really see through glass. It’s not really what’shappening. What’s happening is the light is all colliding and creating hologramsall over the place and you’re figuring out what must be there.See the interesting thing about the hologram is when you remove the objectthere is a picture of it there. But the way the light is your brain knows what musthave been there at the time the hologram was made. That’s why when youbreak it in half you can still tell everything that’s there."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch30If you take a magnifying glass and two chess pieces and make a hologram of it... when you take all the chess pieces and the magnifying glass away and lookat it and see them. When you go this way it will magnify one thing and when yougo that way it will magnify another. Because it’s the knowledge that’s createdthere not representations that are one on one relationships. This is how themind works. This is why we’re able to do such things as blow certain things outof proportion when people use a phrase or an idiomatic speech.I thought it was funny that everybody missed accessing cues in the first place.Because when people talk about feelings they go: ”Well, it’s down rightimpossible” and I mean they come right out and say it, and move their eyes inthat direction. It seemed to me that if psychologists were really observant theymight have seen that, you know when people go: ”Mhmm, let’s see”. They stop,they say it and they do it. When they literally make gestures like telephones, puttheir hand up to their ears and go: ”Well I tell myself” and their’re pointing totheir ear, touching their ear. I mean, one they go: ”see”, and they look up, onethey go: ”feel”, down right and the other they go: ”Well, I tell myself” and touchtheir ear. If psychologists had really been observant they would have noticedthis.The reason I noticed it is that I don’t have a theory. So I don’t have anything tofit anything through. I’m anti-theoretical and it’s because I am only looking forwhat works. And I don’t need to know why. In fact to me causal relationships Iknow are deceptive.Everything that we know in science in a hundred or two hundred years will betotally wrong. It will be antiquated.All the theories, the laws of thermodynamics are disproved now. I disproved oneof them myself. I mean I went to a physics convention and did all themathematics to prove to them that the law of entropy is simply not the case.That’s the second law of thermodynamic which says that everything will becomemore random and falling apart. And this just simply is not the case. All thetoasters are appearing right here on this planet. And what that means is theelements that it takes to put together an object and make it a toaster requireone of the forces that they do not take into account in their equations:consciousness!It won’t be long before some visual goes out there and takes the asteroid beltand organizes them by size. It won’t be long before people are redoing thesethings. We have great things ahead of us for human beings. And the littlethings we are worrying about now ... about what religion somebody believes in,what the name of the country is, if they are ethnic Albanians as opposed to whatother kind of Albanians. But how they tell them apart is beyond me. And whythey bother to is even more beyond me. To create chaos when people aretrying to make everything fit what they understand ... that there has to be goodguys and bad guys, and right and wrong. And the right and wrong isn’t based onwhat works, it’s based on what’s convenient. It’s transient.See, on the other hand everything that’s in fiction will still be the same inhundred years, so therefor all the things in science fiction and all the things infiction will remain constant and all the science is transitory. And this is why Iknow that even though the times seem dark and people seem like they havetrouble I always have to tell them that there is delight at the end of the tunnel.Ronnie: So you are optimistic that we are heading for an evolution."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"NLP INSTITUT ZUERICH© Ronald Amsler 1999, Lättenstrasse 18, 8914 Aeugst am AlbisTel 01/761 08 38 Fax 01/761 08 09 email: ronnie@nlp-institut.ch31Richard: Well, evolution can‘t be over, that’s for sure."}]
