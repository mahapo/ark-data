The Alabaster Sarcophagus of Seti I."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Sacred Texts Egypt EHH Index Index Previous Next p. 43THE BOOK OF GATESCHAPTER I.THE ALABASTER SARCOPHAGUS OF SETI I.THE text of the \"Book of Gates,\" printed in the following pages, is taken from the alabaster sarcophagusof king Seti I., B.C. 1370, which is preserved in the Museum of Sir John Soane, at 13, Lincoln's InnFields. This sarcophagus is, undoubtedly, one of the chief authorities for the text of that remarkablebook; but before any attempt is made to describe the arrangement of the scenes and the inscriptionswhich accompany them, it will be well to recall the principal facts connected with its discovery byGiovanni Battista Belzoni, who has fortunately placed them on record in his Narrative of the Operationsand recent discoveries within the pyramids, temples, tombs and Excavations in Egypt and Nubia,London, 1820, p. 233 ff. In October, 1815, Belzoni began to excavate in the Biban-al-Muluk, i.e., theValley of the Tombs of the Kings, on the western bank of the Nile at Thebes, and in thep. 44bed of a watercourse he found a spot where the ground bore traces of having been \"moved.\" On the 19thof the month his workmen made a way through the sand and fragments of stone which had been piled upthere, and entered the first corridor or passage of a magnificent tomb, which he soon discovered to havebeen made for one of the great kings of Egypt. A second corridor led him to a square chamber which,being thirty feet deep, formed a serious obstacle in the way of any unauthorized intruder, and served tocatch any rain-water which might make its way down the corridors from the entrance. Beyond thischamber are two halls, and from the first of these Belzoni passed through other corridors and rooms untilhe entered the vaulted chamber in which stood the sarcophagus. 1 The sarcophagus chamber is situatedat a distance of 320 feet from the entrance to the first corridor, and is 180 feet below the level of theground. Belzoni succeeded in bringing the sarcophagus from its chamber into the light of day withoutinjury, and in due course it arrived in England; the negotiations which he opened with the Trustees of theBritish Museum, to whom its purchase was first proposed, fell through, and he subsequently sold it to SirJohn Soane, it is said for the sum of ¬£2000. An examination of the sarcophagus shows that both it and itscover were hollowed out of monolithic blocks of alabaster,p. 45and it is probable, as Mr. Sharpe says, 1 that these were quarried in the mountains near Alabastronpolis,i.e., the district which was known to the Egyptians by the name of Het-nub, and is situated near the ruinsknown in modern times by the name of Tell al-'Amarna. In the Yet-nub quarries large numbers ofinscriptions, written chiefly in the hieratic character, have been found, and from the interesting selectionfrom these published by Messrs. Blackden and Fraser, we learn that several kings of the Ancient andMiddle Empires carried on works in them, no doubt for the purpose of obtaining alabaster for funeralpurposes. The sarcophagus is 9 ft. 4 in. long, 3 ft. 8 in. wide, in the widest part, and 2 ft. 8 in. high at theshoulders, and 2 ft. 3 in. at the feet; the cover is 1 ft. 3 in. high. The thickness of the alabaster varies from21 to 4 inches. The skill of the mason who succeeded in hollowing the blocks without breaking, or evencracking them, is marvellous, and the remains of holes nearly one inch in diameter suggest that the drillwas as useful to him as the chisel and mallet in hollowing out the blocks. When the sarcophagus and itscover were finally shaped and polished, they were handed over to an artisan who was skilled in cutting"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"hieroglyphics and figures of the gods, &c., in stone, and both the insides and outsides were covered byhimp. 46with inscriptions and vignettes and mythological scones which illustrated them. Both inscriptions andscenes were then filled in with a kind of paint made from some preparation of copper, and the vividbluish green colour of this paint must have formed a striking contrast to the brilliant whiteness of thealabaster when fresh from the quarry. At the present time large numbers of characters and figures aredenuded of their colour, and those in which it still remains are much discoloured by London fog andsoot.The first to attempt to describe the contents of the texts and scenes on the sarcophagus of SETI I. was thelate Samuel Sharpe, who, with the late Joseph Bonomi, published \"The Alabaster Sarcophagus ofOimenepthah I., King of Egypt,\" London, 1864, 4to; the former was responsible for the letterpress, andthe latter for the plates of scenes and texts. For some reason which it is not easy to understand, Mr.Sharpe decided that the hieroglyphic characters which formed the prenomen of the king for whom thesarcophagus was made were to be read \"Oimenepthah,\" a result which he obtained by assigning thephonetic value of O to the hieroglyphic sign for Osiris . The prenomen is sometimes written, or , and , and is to be read either SETI-MEN-EN PTAH,or SETI-MEN-EN-PTAH. Mr. Sharpe did not, apparently, realize that both the signs and p. 47were to be read \"Set,\" and he gave to the first the phonetic value of A and to the second the value of O;he next identified \"Aimenepthah\" or \"Oimenepthah\" with the Amenophath of Manetho, and theChomaepthah of Eratosthenes, saying, \"hence arises the support to our reading his name (i.e., the king's)Oimenepthah.\" Passing over Mr. Sharpe's further remarks, which assert that the sarcophagus was made inthe year B.C. 1175 (!), we must consider briefly the arrangement of the texts and scenes upon the insidesand outsides of the sarcophagus and its covers. On the upper outside edge of the sarcophagus runs asingle line of hieroglyphics which contains speeches supposed to be made to the deceased by the fourchildren of Horus; this line is in two sections, each of which begins at the right hand side of the head,and ends at the left hand side of the foot. Below this line of hieroglyphics are five large scenes, each ofwhich is divided into three registers, and these are enclosed between two dotted bands which areintended to represent the borders of the \"Valley of the Other World.\" On the inside of the sarcophagusare also five scenes, but there is no line of hieroglyphics running along the upper edge. On the bottom ofthe sarcophagus is a finely cut figure of the Goddess Nut, and round and about her are texts selectedfrom the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead; on the inside of the cover is a figure of the goddessNut, with arms outstretched. On the outside of thep. 48cover, in addition to the texts which record the names and titles of the deceased, are inscribed two largescenes, each of which is divided into three registers, like those inside and outside the sarcophagus.The line of text on the upper outside edge reads:--p. 50I. Speech of MESTHA: \"I am Mestha, I am [thy] son, O Osiris, king, lord of the two lands, Men-Maat-Ra,whose word is maat, son of the Sun, Seti Mer-en-Ptah, whose word is maat, and I have come so that I"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"may be among those who protect thee.

The speech of Nut is a duplicate of the opening lines of that found on the bottom of thesarcophagus (see above ¬ß v., p. 55); the speech of Thoth is much mutilated, and can have contained littleexcept the promise to be with the king, and a repetition of the royal name and titles. On the inside of thecover were texts, many portions of which are identical, as we see from the fragments which remain, withthe Chapters from the Book of the Dead which are found on the bottom of the sarcophagus, and whichhave been transcribed above. At each side of the figure of the winged goddess which was cut on thebreast was a figure of the god Thoth, who is seen holding a staff surmounted by the symbol of \"night.\".When the cover was complete there were probably four such figures upon it, and the texts whichaccompanied them were, no doubt,p. 70identical with those found in Chapter CLXI. of the Book of the Dead.The scenes and inscriptions which cover the inside and outside of the sarcophagus are described andtranscribed in the following chapters.p. 71APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I.BELZONI'S ACCOUNT OF HIS DISCOVERY OF THE TOMB OF SETI I.\"ON the 16th (of October) I recommenced my excavations in the Valley of Beban el Malook, andpointed but the fortunate spot, which has paid me for all the trouble I took in my researches. I may callthis a fortunate day, one of the best perhaps of my life; I do not mean to say, that fortune has made merich, for I do not consider all rich men fortunate; but she has given me that satisfaction, that extremepleasure, which wealth cannot purchase; the pleasure of discovering what has been long sought in vain,and of presenting the world with a new and perfect monument of Egyptian antiquity, which can berecorded as superior to any other in point of grandeur, style, and preservation, appearing as if justfinished on the day we entered it; and what I found in it will show its great superiority to all others. Notfifteen yards from the last tomb I described, I caused the earth to be opened at the foot of a steep hill,and under a torrent, which, when it rains, pours a great quantity of water over the very spot I havep. 72caused to be dug. No one could imagine, that the ancient Egyptians would make the entrance into suchan immense and superb excavation Just under a torrent of water; but I had strong reasons to suppose,that there was a tomb in that place, from indications I had observed in my pursuit. The Fellahs who wereaccustomed to dig were all of opinion, that there was nothing in that spot, as the situation of this tombdiffered from that of any other. I continued the work, however, and the next day, the 17th, in the eveningwe perceived the part of the rock that was cut, and formed the entrance. On the 18th, early in themorning, the task was resumed, and about noon the workmen reached the entrance, which was eighteenfeet below the surface of the ground. The appearance indicated, that the tomb was of the first rate; butstill I did not expect to find such a one as it really proved to be. The Fellahs advanced till they saw that itwas probably a large tomb, when they protested they could go no further, the tomb was so much chokedup with large stones, which they could not get out of the passage. I descended, examined the place,pointed out to them where they might dig, and in an hour there was room enough for me to enter througha passage that the earth had left under the ceiling of the first corridor, which is 36 ft. 2 in. long, and 8 ft.8 in. wide, and, when cleared of the ruins, 6 ft. 9 in. high. I perceived immediately by the painting on the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"p. 73ceiling, and by the hieroglyphics in basso relievo, which were to be seen where the earth did not reach,that this was the entrance into a large and magnificent tomb. At the end of this corridor I came to astaircase 23 ft. long, and of the same breadth as the corridor. The door at the bottom is 12 ft. high. Fromthe foot of the staircase I entered another corridor, 37 ft. 3 in. long, and of the same width and height asthe other, each side sculptured with hieroglyphics in basso relievo, and painted. The ceiling also is finelypainted, and in pretty good preservation. The more I saw, the more I was eager to see, such being thenature of man; but I was checked in my anxiety at this time, for at the end of this passage I reached alarge pit, which intercepted my progress. This pit is 30 ft. deep, and 14 ft. by 12 ft. 3 in. wide. The upperpart of the pit is adorned with figures, from the wall of the passage up to the ceiling. The passages fromthe entrance all the way to this pit have an inclination downward of an angle of eighteen degrees. On theopposite side of the pit facing the entrance I perceived a small aperture 2 ft. wide and 2 ft. 6 in. high, andat the bottom of the wall a quantity of rubbish. A rope fastened to a piece of wood, that was laid acrossthe passage against the projections which formed a kind of door, appears to have been used by theancients for descending into the pit; and from the small aperture oil the opposite side hung another,whichp. 74reached the bottom, no doubt for the purpose of ascending. We could clearly perceive, that the waterwhich entered the passages from the torrents of rain ran into this pit, and the wood and rope fastened toit crumbled to dust on touching them. At the bottom of the pit were several pieces of wood, placedagainst the side of it, so as to assist the person who was to ascend by the rope into the aperture. I saw theimpossibility of proceeding at the moment. Mr. Beechey, who that day came from Luxor, entered thetomb, but was also disappointed.\"The next day, the 19th, by means of a long beam we succeeded in sending a man up into the aperture,and having contrived to make a bridge of two beams, we crossed the pit. The little aperture we found tobe an opening forced through a wall, that had entirely closed the entrance, which was as large as thecorridor. The Egyptians had closely shut it up, plastered the wall over, and painted it like the rest of thesides of the pit, so that but for the aperture, it would have been impossible to suppose, that there was anyfurther proceeding; and anyone would conclude, that the tomb ended with the pit. The rope in the insideof the wall did not fall to dust, but remained pretty strong, the water not having reached it at all; and thewood to which it was attached was in good. preservation. It was owing to this method of keeping thedamp out of the inner parts of the tomb, that they are so well preserved. I observedp. 75some cavities at the, bottom of the well, but found nothing in them, nor any communication from thebottom to any other place; therefore we could not doubt their being made to receive the waters from therain, which happens occasionally in this mountain. The valley is so much raised by the rubbish, whichthe water carries down from the upper parts, that the entrance into these tombs is become -much lowerthan the torrents; in consequence, the water finds its way into the tombs, some of which are entirelychoked up with earth.\"When we had passed through the little aperture we found ourselves in a beautiful hall, 27 ft. 6 in. by 25ft. 10 in., in which were four pillars 3 ft. square. I shall not give any description of the painting, till I havedescribed the whole of the chambers. At the end of this room, which I call the entrance-hall, andopposite the aperture, is a large door, from which three steps lead down into a chamber with two pillars.This is 28 ft. 2 in. by 25 ft. 6 in. The pillars are 3 ft. 10 in. square. I gave it the name of thedrawing-room; for it is covered with figures, which though only outlined, are so fine and perfect, that youwould think they had been drawn only the day before. Returning into the entrance-hall, we saw on the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"left of the aperture a large staircase, which descended into a corridor. It is 13 ft. 4 in. long, 7 ft. 6 in.wide, and has 18 steps. At the bottom we entered a beautiful corridor, 3 6 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft. 11 in.p. 76[paragraph continues] We perceived that the paintings became more perfect as we advanced farther into theinterior. They retained their gloss, or a kind of varnish over the colours, which had a beautiful effect. Thefigures are painted on a white ground. At the end of this (corridor we descended ten steps, which I callthe small stairs, into another, 17 ft. 2 in. by 10 ft. 5 in. From this we entered a small chamber, 20 ft. 4 in.by 13 ft. 8 in., to which I gave the name of the Room of Beauties; for it is adorned with the mostbeautiful figures in basso relievo, like all the rest, and painted. When standing in the centre of thischamber, the traveller is surrounded by an assembly of Egyptian gods and goddesses. Proceeding farther,we entered a large hall, 27 ft. 9 in. by 26 ft. 10 in. In this hall are two rows of square pillars, three oneach side of the entrance, forming a line with the corridors. At each side of this hall is a small chamber;that on the right is 10 ft. 5 in. by 8 ft. 8 in., that on the left 10 ft. 5 in. by 8 ft. 9¬Ω in. This hall I termedthe Hall of Pillars; the little room on the right, Isis' Room, as in it a large cow is painted, of which I shallgive a description hereafter; that on the left, the Room of Mysteries, from the mysterious figures itexhibits. At the end of this hall we entered a large saloon, with an arched roof or ceiling, which isseparated from the Hall of Pillars only by a step so that the two may be reckoned one. The saloon is 31ft. 10 in. by 27 ft. On the right is a smallp. 77chamber without anything in it, roughly cut, as if unfinished, and without painting; on the left we entereda chamber with two square pillars, 25 ft. 8 in. by 22 ft. 10 in. This I called the Sideboard Room, as it hasa projection of 3 ft. in form of a sideboard all round, which was perhaps intended to contain the articlesnecessary for the funeral ceremony. The pillars are 3 ft. 4 in. square, and the whole beautifully painted asthe rest. At the same end of the room, and facing the Hall of Pillars, we entered by a large door intoanother chamber with four pillars, one of which is fallen down. This chamber is 43 ft. 4 in. by 17 ft. 6in.; the pillars 3 ft. 7 in. square. It is covered with white plaster, where the rock did not cut smoothly, butthere is no painting on it. I named it the Bull's, or Apis' Room, as we found the carcass of a bull in it,embalmed with asphaltum; and also, scattered in various places, ail immense quantity of small woodenfigures of mummies 6 or 8 in. long, and covered with asphaltum to preserve them. There were someother figures of fine earth baked, coloured blue, and strongly varnished. On each side of the two littlerooms were wooden statues standing erect, 4 ft. high, with a circular hollow inside, as if to contain a rollof papyrus, which I have no doubt they did. We found likewise fragments of other statues of wood andof composition.\"But the description of what we found in the centre of the saloon, and which I have reserved till thisplace,p. 78merits the most particular attention, not having its equal in the world, and being such as we had no ideacould exist. It is a sarcophagus of the finest oriental alabaster, 9 ft. 5 in. long, and 3 ft. 7 in. wide. Itsthickness is only 2 in., and it is transparent, when a light is placed in the inside of it. It is minutelysculptured within and without with several hundred figures, which do not exceed 2 in. in height, andrepresent, as I suppose, the whole of the funeral procession and ceremonies relating to the deceased,united with several emblems, &c. I cannot give an adequate idea of this beautiful and invaluable piece ofantiquity, and can only say, that nothing has been brought into Europe from Egypt that can be comparedwith it. The cover was not there; it had been taken out, and broken into several pieces, which we foundin digging before the first entrance. The sarcophagus was over a staircase in the centre of the saloon,which communicated with a subterraneous passage, leading downwards, 300 ft. in length. At the end ofthis passage we found a great quantity of bats' dung, which choked it up, so that we could go no fartherwithout digging. It was nearly filled up too by the falling in of the upper part. One hundred feet from the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"entrance is a staircase in good preservation; but the rock below changes its substance, from a beautifulsolid calcareous stone, becoming a kind of black rotten slate, which crumbles into dust only by touching.This subterraneous passage proceeds in a south-westp. 79direction through the mountain. I measured the distance from the entrance, and also the rocks above, andfound that the passage reaches nearly halfway through the mountain to the upper part of the valley. Ihave reasons to suppose, that this passage was used to come into the tomb by another entrance; but thiscould not be after the death of the person who was buried there, for at the bottom of the stairs just tinderthe sarcophagus a wall was built, which entirely closed the communication between the tomb and thesubterraneous passage. Some large blocks of stone were placed under the sarcophagus horizontally, levelwith the pavement of the saloon, that no one might perceive any stairs or subterranean passage was there.The doorway of the sideboard room had been walled up, and forced open, as we found the stones withwhich it was shut, and the mortar in the jambs. The staircase of the entrance-hall had been walled upalso at the bottom, and the space filled, with rubbish, and the floor covered with large blocks of stone, soas to deceive any one who should force the fallen wall near the pit, and make him suppose, that the tombended with the entrance-hall and the drawing-room. I am inclined to believe, that whoever forced allthese passages must have had some spies with them, who were well acquainted with the tombthroughout. The tomb faces the north-east, and the direction of the whole runs straight south-west.\"Footnotes44:1 As Belzoni's narrative is of interest, his account of his discovery of Seti's tomb is given in theAppendix to this Chapter.45:1 The Alabaster Sarcophagus of Oimenepthah I., King of Egypt.

M. Lef√©bure translates the inscription, \"Osiris, master of Hades, Earth, and Tanen.\" Osiris, whowears the double crown of the South and North, and holds in his right hand the symbol of \"life,\" and inhis left a sceptre, is seated on a chair of state, which is set on the top of a platform with nine steps. Oneach stop stands a god, and the nine gods are described as the \"company which is with SAR, i.e., Osiris.\"On the topmost step is a Balance, in which the actions of the deceased are weighed; the beam of theBalance is supported either by the deceased, or by a stand which is made in the form of a beardedmummy. One pan of the Balance contains some rectangular object, and the other a figure of the birdwhich is symbolic of evil and wickedness. Behind the Balance is a boat, which is sailing away from thepresence of Osiris; in it is a pig being driven along by a dog-headed ape which flourishes a stick. In thetop left-hand corner is a figure of Anubis, jackal-headed, and under the floor of the platform on whichOsiris is seated are figures of the enemy of SAR, or Osiris. From the variant of this scene which is foundon the sarcophagus of Tchehra at Paris, 1 as well as from the sarcophagus of Seti I., we may see that thepig in thep. 162boat is called AM-A, i.e., \"Eater of the Arm,\" and the boat is piloted by a second ape which stands in thebows. On the Paris monument we see a man wielding a hatchet in a threatening manner and standingnear the Scales, probably with the view of destroying the deceased if the judgment of Osiris proveadverse to him.This inscription is in the so-called \"enigmatic\" writing, 1 a fact which was first noticed by Champollion,but a transcript of it exists on the sarcophagus of Tchehra in characters which have the ordinary values, 2and this reads as follows:--p. 163[paragraph continues] \"His enemies are under his feet, the gods and the spirits are before him; he is the enemyof the dead (i.e., the damned) among the beings of the Tuat, Osiris putteth under restraint [his] enemies,he destroyeth them, and he performeth the slaughter of them.\"The text which refers to Anubis Mr. Goodwin transcribed:--\"Hail, O ye who make to be maat the wordof your little one, may Thoth weigh the words, may he make to eat his father.\"Immediately over the boat is the short inscription which Goodwin renders by, \"[When] this god entereth,he (i.e., the Ape) riseth and putteth under restraint AM-A (i.e., the Eater of the Arm).\" 1p. 164Behind the pair of scales is the legend 1 which Mr. Goodwin renders, \"The balance-bearer does homage;the blessed spirits in Amenti follow after him; the morning, star disperses the thick darkness; there isgood will above, justice below. The god reposes himself, he gives bread to the blessed, who throng,towards him.\" The translation by M. Lef√©bure reads, \"The bearer of the hatchet and the bearer of thescales protect the inhabitant of Amenti, [who] takes his repose in Hades, and traverses the darkness andthe shadows.
