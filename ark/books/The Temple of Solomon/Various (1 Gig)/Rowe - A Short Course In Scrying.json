The current version has been slightly rewrittento enhance the clarity of the presentation, and to include a small amount of additionalmaterial.The techniques described herein are adaptations of techniques I learned fromtwo sources. The first of these is Mr. Brian D., who taught me the basic methodmany years ago. The second is Mr. Paul Solomon and his group, the Fellowship ofthe Inner Light, who had transformed that method into the foundation of their systemof spiritual work.Special thanks also to the “secret chiefs” of the Fellowship, for their directand effective contribution to my work at a critical point. Some debts can never berepaid; the best that can be done is to pass on what was given."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ô\u0003\u0014\u0003Chapter 1.Preliminary ConsiderationsTo begin, the reader should understand that scrying is as much a learned skillas is reading or ice-skating. Persistent practice is necessary to teach the nervoussystem how to do it, even where the person has some innate talent. And as with otherlearned skills, there is a learning curve. At first there will be a long period when youdon’t seem to be making any significant progress. Then things will suddenly falltogether and your practice will improve markedly in a short period, before levelingoff again at something close to your highest level of skill.It is best to expect a learning period of several months; don’t expect quickresults. It is likely that you will have occasional sessions where things work muchbetter than usual. Don’t be too encouraged by these, as it is likely that you will fallback to a lower level in the next session. When an improvement lasts for a week ormore, you are justified in judging it a genuine advance.Before getting to skrying techniques as such, I want to discuss the variouskinds of distractions that can cause trouble for beginners, and suggest somesolutions. Distractions can be generally classified in three types:• Physical distractions. E.g., itches, muscle aches and twitches, etc.• External distractions. House and street noises, other residents of your home,etc.• Mental distractions. The internal \"chatter\" that we are all prone to.Four of the traditional practices of yoga are intended to reduce and eliminatesuch distractions. Asana and (to a small extent) pranayama deal with physicaldistractions; pratyahara with external distractions, and dharana with mentaldistractions. These high-discipline practices are more than most people will need forour current purposes; perfection isn’t necessary, just something \"good enough\". Butthose who find they do need more than the simple techniques described here maywish to look into them.One tradition of asana practice seeks to eliminate physical distractions bytraining the body to remain in a single posture for long periods of time. The musclesare trained to maintain a state of tension such that the body remains locked into thechosen posture. The lack of movement reduces the intensity of the body’s sensorysignals to the brain. That is to say, repetitive, unchanging signals are completelyprocessed at the pre-conscious level and are never brought to the attention of theconscious mind. Unfortunately, the traditional practice usually produces extremepain for a long period before the muscles are trained to a given posture.The same effect can be produced without the painful intermediate stage byachieving a state of profound physical relaxation. The nervous system doesn’t care"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0015\u0003why it is getting repetitive signals from the body, but only that it is so. Lack ofmovement engendered by relaxation is just as good at producing such signals as islack of movement produced by muscle locking.The practitioner should begin by choosing a comfortable posture that can bemaintained without muscular tension. A sitting posture is recommended over asupine position, since relaxing while lying down easily leads to sleep. I preferred tosit cross-legged on a bed, with my back supported by a pillow against the wall. Ahigh-backed easy chair is as good. All that matters is that you can be perfectlyrelaxed in the position without falling over.A certain type of breathing can help promote relaxation. Take a deep gulp ofair through your mouth, breathing from the belly; don’t strain to take in themaximum. Hold it as long as is comfortable, and then release it, allowing the weightof your ribs and the natural tension of your diaphragm to push the air out of yourlungs without forcing it. Relax for a moment at the end of the breath. Repeat for oneminute, or until you start to feel dizzy. You will find that as you release the breath,all your muscles have a tendency to loosen. (This type of breathing is, perhaps notcoincidentally, identical to the way one tokes a joint of marijuana.)Once you are comfortable and have done the breathing, begin to work atrelaxing each muscle in your body individually. Start with the scalp and face, andwork your way down the body, working outwards from the spine at each level.Complete relaxation of any muscle will be accompanied by a pleasant \"melting\"sensation; try to make your whole body feel as if it has melted into a puddle of warmpudding.By the time you have reached your feet, you will probably find that your faceand scalp muscles have tensed up again, just from your concentration on the task.Start again at the top and work your way down, repeating as often as needed to get toa state of complete relaxation. When the physical relaxation is complete, try toextend it to the inside of your head as well, letting your awareness float in a warminternal glow.While this exercise is simple and easily mastered, it is very important. Mostof the other forms of distraction that practitioners encounter are accompanied bytension reactions in some part of the body. An extreme example is the \"startle\"reaction, in which some small noise triggers a state of high alert in your body; yourheart suddenly jumps and increases its rate of beating, and every muscle in the bodysuddenly tenses. The parts of the mind responsible for these reactions anddistractions are often not directly accessible to consciousness; but since body andmind influence each other, you can begin to subvert and eliminate the reactions byeliminating their physical manifestations.The other aspect of controlling distractions is to understand the nature of thehuman mind. Each of us is not a single being, but a multitude. Our minds arecomposed of many \"sub-minds\", each with its own special functions. Some of these"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"35(/,0,1$5<\u0003&216,'(5$7,216Ô\u0003\u0016\u0003(the visual sub-minds, for instance) are so intimately connected with ourconsciousness that we never notice their functioning unless something goes seriouslywrong. Others act with greater independence. But while they are not accessible in thesame way that, e.g., the language forming parts of the mind are, there iscommunication back and forth between them, and between them and the consciousmind.The conscious self, the part of the mind that calls itself \"I\", is supposed tofunction as a mediator, arbiter, synthesizer and director between these other aspectsof our being. Its function is to take the results of their work, compare and evaluatethem, make use of them to act in the world, and direct their future work on the basisof the results obtained. When there are conflicts between different sub-minds, theconscious self is supposed to \"keep the peace\" by balancing their respective needsand viewpoints.Unfortunately, human evolution is not yet at the point where theconsciousness automatically functions in the best way possible. The capability for itto do so is there, but it requires training and experience to develop its properrelationship to the other sub-minds. Lacking that training, we too often end up actingas censors and tyrants rather than mediators, suppressing troublesome messages fromthese parts rather than dealing with them. And as often as they are suppressed, theyleak up through some other channel, producing distractions and what Crowley called\"breaks\" in one’s practice.The key to permanently relieving both physical and mental distractions is todeal with them in the right way, immediately, as you become aware that they areoccurring. You have to re-condition yourself into the desired response while thedistracting sensations or thoughts are still present in your mind, and the physicaltensions are still in your body. The sub-minds aren’t particularly time-conscious; theyunderstand what is happening \"now\" much better than events in the past or future.Once you have achieved a state of physical relaxation, try just sitting in therelaxed state, with your mind not focused on any particular thing and with nointention of doing anything else for a while. It is a sure bet that after a few minutes,some part of your mind will take the opportunity to bring its own concerns to thesurface, and you will start talking to yourself mentally about whatever it is concernedwith.As soon as you realize you are following some line of thought, stop andassess your body’s state. Do the relaxation exercises until you are back in acompletely relaxed condition. Then imagine that you are extending that relaxation tothe part of your mind that brought up the thoughts you were thinking. Imagine thatpart enveloped and permeated by a warm, melting glow, while simultaneously youtalk to it, telling it: \"Relax, be still, there is nothing you need to do right now.\"Successful relaxation of a sub-mind through this procedure will produce a sensationof a sudden, mildly pleasurable energy-release in some part of your brain, sometimesaccompanied by a sensation of \"clearness\"."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0017\u0003It is likely that by the time you get one sub-mind quieted -- or even while youare still working on it -- another part will pop up with a different thought-train. Keepworking on the first instance and ignore the new one. Don’t be concerned if you don’tget to everything that comes along during this practice; the things you miss arecertain to show up again at a later time. Do one thing at a time and don’t jumparound. If you forget what you are doing somewhere in the middle of things, juststart over with the relaxation exercises, and unfocusing your attention.This same technique can be applied to external disturbances. The onlydifference is that when telling the disturbed sub-mind to relax, you tell it that thenoise or other distraction is unimportant and not worth attention.The Fellowship of the Inner Light teaches a slight variation on this method,which some people may prefer. They use a particular biblical (?) phrase whenspeaking to the sub-minds; it is almost a mantra in their version of this practice. Thephrase is: \"Be still, and know that I Am god.\" The intent of this usage is to assert theconscious self’s rightful place as director and decision-maker, while at the same timeacknowledging the existence of the sub-minds as quasi-separate entities.And rather than just sitting with one’s attention unfocused, they prefer thatthe practitioner use a mantra: \"Eheieh\", meaning \"I am\", the highest name of God inthe Hebrew cabala. The mantra should be spoken internally, in a relaxed and casualmanner; i.e., whenever the practitioner happens to think of it, rather than in steadyrepetition. I personally find that the use of a mantra tends to produce tensions ratherthan alleviate them, but this may not be the case for others.Continued use of this simple practice will, over time, result in a profoundreduction in the amount of verbal \"noise\" your mind produces, and make itsubstantially easier to concentrate on the visual images of the \"magickal space\"techniques to be described in the next section. You don’t have to be proficient at thisbefore going on to create a magickal space; the two efforts can be done in parallel,with each reinforcing the other."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Ô\u0003\u0018\u0003Chapter 2.Creating a magickal spaceThe foundation of all magickal work is the imagination. The part of the mindthat creates images serves as a meeting ground between the conscious mind, theunconscious parts of our being, and the magickal universe at large. Visual symbolsare the primary means by which meaning is communicated in the magickal worlds.The more flexible you make your imagination, the more effective your magickalwork can be.The best exercise I know of for developing the imagination is called \"creatinga refuge\" or \"creating a magickal space\". I first learned the technique from a VietnamWar veteran. He said that the U.S. Army Special Forces taught it as a means ofmaintaining a sense of privacy, personal integrity, and personal space underconditions -- as in Viet Cong POW camps -- where these things would bedeliberately denied to him by his enemies. When I encountered the Fellowship of theInner Light a few years later, I found that they were teaching essentially the sametechnique for purposes of self-mastery and spiritual development.Once you become practiced in the method it requires no special physicalplace; it is completely \"portable\" and can be done anywhere you can sit and relax fora moment. I have used it effectively in many \"un-magickal\" environments; e.g., acrowded government office, a busy commercial hotel, and in the middle of the LasVegas COMDEX show.The basic idea is very simple. You make up an imaginary world that youwould enjoy being in, and then you imagine yourself walking around in this world.Not much different, in principle, than what people do in any ordinary daydream. Buthere the idea is to work for consistency, so that it appears the same every time youenter it, and to continually add details to it. With practice and familiarity thisimaginary world will begin to take on a sense of being a \"real\" place, not real in thesame way as the physical world, but having permanence and a separate existencenonetheless.For purposes of illustration, I am going to describe one of my own magickalspaces, one that I no longer use. It is important to understand that at every step, theimages you use should be those that feel right to you; this is to be your own privatespace and its contents should always come out of yourself and be meaningful to you.Your space may resemble mine in some aspects; if so, that is all right. More likely itwill not, and that too is perfectly appropriate.The steps described here should be done sequentially, but you do not have tobe perfect at any step before going on to the next. Right from the beginning, you canwork on several steps in a single session. However, in any given session most ofyour attention should be given to the earliest steps in whatever group you are"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0019\u0003working on. As each step becomes more familiar it will take less practice to reach asatisfactory level and you can naturally give more attention to the next.Establish the boundariesUntil your magickal space is well established, you should begin every sessionby affirming its invulnerability. Imagine that your space is invisible to any being butyourself, and is impenetrable by any force or person without your express, consciouspermission. Think up an image of your space’s boundaries that reflects these ideas. Iimagine my magickal spaces as \"pocket universes\" that, seen from the outside, are sotiny as to be lost in the immensity of our own universe; seen from inside, they are asbig as I want or need them to be. Other people I know of imagine theirs assurrounded by an adamantine shell, or by a science-fiction force field that \"bends\" allforces so that they bypass it.Once you have the boundary of your space established, imagine yourselfinside it. As you enter into it, feel all the pressures and demands of your daily lifebeing locked out behind you, unable to follow you in. Imagine that they becamecompletely disconnected from you at the moment you entered your space. They arenot trying to force their way in; they can not even sense your space or yourself insideit and are drifting away without finding anything to attach to. Feel yourself to betotally safe, totally free of any connection to the mundane world.This matter of feeling safe is very important. As in the relaxation exercises,the feelings you generate are the way you tell the unconscious parts of yourself, the\"sub-minds\", what to believe and how to act. As far as they are concerned, what youfeel is what is real; tell them something often enough, and they will begin tocooperate in making it so, to an extent you could not manage with your consciousresources. If you feel safe and free from pressure in your magickal space, then in ashort time you will actually be safe and free there.Create the landscape.Once you have established a secure space, take some time to think about thegeneral layout of your world. Decide on the major features of the landscape, whatsorts of buildings or other structures you want. Make a mental map of the areas inyour world that you will want to visit most often. Once you decide on these majorfeatures, they should not change.A few ground rules for inventing your world:• You should keep the contents of your world absolutely private. Do notspeak of them to anyone, and do not write them down anywhere. Thisfirst world is going to be your secret refuge and workplace, and much ofits protection comes from no one knowing what it is like. Once you have"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CREATING A MAGICKALSPACEÔ\u0003\u001a\u0003the technique down, you can build other magickal spaces for publicpurposes.• Make your world much bigger than you could maintain by conscious useof your imagination. Create as many detailed areas as you want, butsurround these with large regions whose landscape is only known in ageneral way, and whose specific content is unknown. These allow roomfor expansion, and for the \"surprise me\" exercises later on in this paper.• Make the world a place where you feel comfortable and safe, so that itreinforces the impressions established in the previous step, and make it aplace where you can have fun.• You can populate your world if you wish, but DO NOT, under anycircumstances, use images of living people in your world. For some time,all of the contents of your world will be a reflection of yourself in oneway or another. There is a possibility that images of people will be \"takenover\" by some unconscious part of your mind as a vehicle of expression.If you use images of real people, the behavior of the image may carryover into your relationships with the real person, with ill effect.Begin to build your world by picking one location within your \"map\" of it,and imagine yourself standing at that spot. Fix the relationships between variouslandmarks in your mind, and see them surrounding you at the proper angles anddistances. Fill in the details to the degree that you would actually be able to see ifyou were standing at a similar spot in the real world.For example, one of my magickal spaces has a landscape of hills and ravinescovered by a thick forest like pre-colonial America. The central area contains arather utilitarian castle on a low bluff overlooking a large river meadow. A smalltame river meanders along one edge of the meadow. Various outbuildings andspecial-purpose areas are dispersed in clearings in the nearby forest.I began to build this world by imagining myself standing in the meadow,looking north. I can see the green grasses, small colorful wildflowers, and anoccasional cowpie nearby. Animal paths wander about, and a more direct human-made path goes from the bluff to the river. The bluff appears to be made of flakygranite, and the castle is right on the brink of it; a couple of winters’ worth of erosionto the bluff might undermine the nearest wall. I can only see all of one castle wallfrom this position, and part of another; I can just barely see the top of a tower abovethe wall. All of the walls are made of dressed gray stone without mortar. Below thecastle a tunnel or gate is cut into the bluff at the meadow level.Turning to the east, I see that the bluff gradually reduces in height towardsthe south, coming down to the meadow somewhat south of my current position. I cansee the end of a dirt road where it curves off the bluff and into the meadow. Moreforest rising behind the road implies that the ground beyond is higher. I know frommy \"map\" that there is an area of grassland a mile or two in that direction."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u001b\u0003Looking south I see that the river continues in that direction, and passesthrough a cut in the hills several miles away. Sunlight glares off the entire length ofthe river in that direction; a haze prevents me from seeing anything beyond the gap.Looking west, I see that the river is fairly shallow at this point; small ripplescover its surface as if it were flowing over a gravel bar. The forest beyond it is edgedwith undergrowth, mostly honeysuckle bushes, which has been tramped down inplaces as if by animals coming for water. Paths leading into the forest quicklydisappear into the shadows of the trees.You do not need to fill in all the details of the scene consciously; in fact, it isbetter to encourage your imagination fill in many of the details by itself. Give it thegeneral outline and let it show you what you should see in such a location. E.g.,instead of trying to imagine each blade of grass and wildflower in the meadow, Iwould let my unconscious do so. If I liked what it did, I would send it a feeling ofapproval; if I didn’t like it, I would tell it to try again, and turn away for a moment tolet it change things.Once you have the view from a particular location fixed fairly well, move toother nearby locations -- twenty to thirty yards away, for outdoor locations -- andimagine what things would look like from this new position. What does the changedperspective reveal that was hidden before? What was unseen from the previouslocation that can be seen now? (Note that perspective in magickal space is neverquite the same as it is in the physical world, though the difference is hard to quantify;you will not be able to make things appear in precisely the way you see naturalobjects.)Keep moving to new locations and build up an image of the scene as it wouldbe seen at each one, until you have a good sense of the place as an actual \"space\". Inthe example space, I spent some time going to various positions in the meadow,noting that less of the castle was visible close to the bluff, more of it from fartheraway; noting the colored gravel in the riverbed, and how it made a ford across theriver, etc. Then I went up to the castle and looked outward from positions on everyside of it, seeing the wider landscape, filling in the positions of various known placesin the forest, deciding how far the grasslands extended behind the castle, and so on.Do this for your own space.When you have established the perspective from several locations, trymoving smoothly between them, with the parallax of the surroundings changingcontinuously, as it does when you move about in the physical world.At first you will find that your perspective on your world has a tendency towithdraw from the scene; your imagination will try to view it as if seen through awindow, or on a movie screen, or like a tableau in a museum. Whenever you noticethis has happened, firmly place your viewpoint back inside the scene, and fix it thereby turning and looking at what is in every direction around you."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CREATING A MAGICKALSPACEÔ\u0003\u001c\u0003Also at first, your world will tend to be still and tableau-like, a frozen image.Once you have the appearance of things fairly well established, try bringing someaction into the scenes. Let grass and tree limbs be blown by breezes, and hear thesounds the wind makes. Watch water move and hear the sounds it makes. Add someliving creatures to the landscape and let them move around in ways appropriate totheir natures.It is also important that you stay relaxed throughout the exercise; doing thiswork should be like a relaxing daydream, not requiring fixed concentration andalertness. Do the relaxation exercise before starting each session, and do it again ifyou find yourself getting tense at any time during the session. Let your mind do asmuch of the work as it can without conscious decisions on your part, and encourageit to do more.You should spend at least several weeks on this exercise, and as much moreas you want. Take your time, relax, and give as much work as you need to filling inthe details in all the important locations in your world. Indoor locations should begiven as much time as the general landscape. The more thoroughly you do the workin these early stages, the more effective your scrying will be later.Establish a body in the magickal spaceThe final step in the basic process of creating a magickal space is to create abody for yourself within that space. Up to this point in the exercises, you have beenpretty much a naked viewpoint, seeing the world but not interacting with it to anygreat extent. Now you need to build up an image of your body within the space, andlearn to use it. To do this, you need to develop a conscious awareness of the sensorysurface of your body and of its kinesthetics, and duplicate these in an \"astral\" body.Judging from accounts by students at the Fellowship of the Inner Light, this part ofthe work gives people the most difficulty, and people will have widely varyingdegrees of success in it.Before entering your magickal space, stand up and relax, preferably withoutany clothes or jewelry. Close your eyes and put your attention onto your skin. Evenwithout anything touching you, you should be able to feel a sense of activity orsensitivity in your skin, a \"readiness to feel\". Note the way your body’s shape isoutlined by the skin sensations.Next, plan out some series of movements that will move every part of yourbody in turn, through most of its range of movement. Tai Chi or Yoga exercises aregood for this if you know them. Still keeping your eyes closed, go through themovements and note how each part of your body feels in different positions, and notewhat your kinesthetic sense tells you about the positioning of your limbs as youmove.Finally, do the same sequence again with your eyes open. This time payattention to the way what you see of your body changes as you go through the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0014\u0013\u0003movements. Pay particular attention to your hands and arms. Try to consciouslyassociate the image of your body with the sensations you get as you move.Each of these three steps focuses on one of the major aspects of your bodyimage: your sense of the body’s boundaries, its internal sensations, and itsappearance to your eyes as you interact with your surroundings. Under normalconditions, these sensations are usually unconscious, and are always secondary towhatever activity you are engaged in. You need to be aware of them consciously inorder to build yourself a second body inside your magickal space. If you wish, youcan do these exercises separately from your practice in your space, until you areready to make your magickal body.Once you are ready, sit down and go through the relaxation exercises, andenter your magickal space. Once there try to feel as if you have a body in themagickal space that feels exactly like your physical body, but is completely separatefrom the physical. Go through the three steps in your imagination, and try toduplicate all the sensations you had while doing them physically. By doing this youwill, over time, gradually build up a perception of your \"astral body\" as a distinctentity, within and a part of your magickal space.After finishing this exercise in each session in your magickal space, spendsome time just moving around your world, touching and manipulating things as ifthey were physical objects. Things you touch should give sensations appropriate totheir nature; bricks and stone should feel hard and rough; metals should feel cool,with textures appropriate to their shape; wood should feel warm and grainy, etc.If you have rituals that you do on a daily basis (and haven’t already starteddoing them in your magickal space) create a dedicated place in your magickal spacefor ritual work and begin doing them there as part of this practice. The regular,repetitive movements of ritual work will serve to reinforce your body image, anddoing the rituals will begin to turn your space from a mere refuge into somethinguseful for your magickal work. In particular, I would recommend practicing theGolden Dawn’s pentagram and hexagram rituals; these will be important later, as ameans of testing the visions you obtain when you start scrying.Potential ProblemsThe most common problem people encounter in this part of the work is main-taining a consistent shape for their body. They find that even after long practice theirhead and arms will remain reasonably well defined, but the rest of their imaginarybody has a tendency to blur into amorphousness. This is a reflection of the relativedensity of nerves in the physical body. Eighty percent of our sensory and kinestheticnerves are in the head and hands; half of the remainder are in the upper chest,shoulders and arms. Our perception of the rest of the body is substantially morevague, and depends as much on sight as on direct sensory connections. When onetries to build an astral body, the mind tends give each part of it a size proportional tothe relative nerve densities."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CREATING A MAGICKALSPACEÔ\u0003\u0014\u0014\u0003This is really not so bad. You don’t need legs in the magickal space, sinceyou are moving yourself around by your volition rather than by pushing yourselfwith muscles. You do need arms and hands to do the gestures of magickal rituals,and lips and jaws to speak the words. If you find that after some practice you can’tmaintain a full body image, don’t worry about it; just get by with what you do have,and imagine the rest of your body concealed by a robe or other loose garment.The second problem people have is that their physical body twitches ormoves when they try to move their magickal body. They unconsciously tense up thephysical body, trying to \"lock\" it so that it won’t follow along with the magickalbody. This is a matter of lifelong habit, of associating the sensations of movementwith the volitional act of moving your muscles. One has to disassociate thesensations from the volition, and another simple exercise will help.In your magickal space, imagine you are standing with your arms held out infront of you, palms facing downwards. Now imagine that you are turning them sothat the palms face upwards, but that you are turning them entirely with your eyes.That is, you see them turning over, and feel the sensations of the changed position,but you don’t involve the part of your mind that moves the muscles. You should seeyour arms move without willing them to move. (In fact, you are directing your willthrough your visual centers instead of your muscles, but it should not seem like youare willing it, at first.)The first few times you do this, your physical arms are almost certain to tenseup into rigidity. When you notice this happening, stop and do the relaxation exercisesuntil your body is loose again, and then go back to trying to move your magickalhands again.Once you succeed in turning your astral hands over without tensing yourphysical hands, you should try moving the fingers individually. Curl each one overonto the palm, and straighten it out again. Again, do the relaxation exercisewhenever your physical body tenses up. When you succeed in moving the individualfingers without tensing up, try various coordinated movements: clenching your fists,grasping objects, karate chops, Vulcan greeting-gestures, and so on.The hands are the hardest part of the magickal body to separate from thephysical, because major portions of our nervous systems go into controlling theirmovement. Once you have managed to dissociate movement of your magickal andphysical hands, the rest of your body will be very easy, and can be done with similarexercises, if necessary."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Ô\u0003\u0014\u0016\u0003Chapter 3.Putting your magickal space to workConcerning symbolsBy the time you have worked the exercises in the previous sections for a fewmonths, you will have established a solid foundation for all your future magickalwork. Practically every magickal and meditation technique you will ever encounteris a variation or extension of the skills you have learned in building your magickalspace.Every person will have a different level of peak performance with these tech-niques. Only a rare few are able to enter wholly into the magickal space, and becomeentirely unconscious of their physical body; for these people, the end result of thiswork is indistinguishable from the classical descriptions of astral projection. Mostpeople will find that a certain portion of their awareness remains \"outside\", and thatthe intensity of the sensations they have never attains the brightness and clarity ofnormal perception. I fall at the low end of this latter category myself; in my visions,colors are more implied than they are perceived directly, and most of the time I needto focus intently to perceive fine details.Being able to put all of your awareness into the magickal space is notnecessarily an advantage. What matters more is that you make the best use of thelevel of skill you do have. It is the meaning you can extract from your experiences,the insights you gain into yourself and the world, and the uses to which you can putthem, that count the most. Bright and glorious visions are nothing, if they have nouseful content or if your awareness and understanding are not (gradually butpermanently) expanded thereby.Having established the basics, in the following sections we are going to lookat various exercises, all of which are forms of \"scrying\". Before going into thedetails, we need to consider -- in a general way -- the nature of the things that aperson experiences while scrying.Dreams, it is often said, are the realm of symbols; the same is true of scrying.But while the symbols of dreams are usually expressions of processes happeningbelow the conscious level of awareness, the symbols seen in scrying are often (in anideal world, always) the expression of processes and events occurring above the levelat which consciousness resides. They are the lowest and most readily apprehendedaspect of processes that the consciousness can not yet completely encompass. In asense, the symbols you see are no more than anchor points; a convenient means bywhich your awareness is given a connection to something coming from outside itscurrent scope."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0014\u0017\u0003The form of the symbol does not necessarily bear any direct relation to thenature of that to which you are being connected. Some symbols -- such as the Greekgods or the cabalist’s Tree of Life -- have forms that directly reflect some aspect ofthe inner reality. Others have connections that are largely a matter of convention;they relate to particular aspects of the inner reality only because we habitually usethem in such a way. The cabalistic color attributes are in this category. And othersyet are seized upon to serve the needs of the moment, and have no particularmeaning outside the context of the vision in which they occur.But in all these cases, when a symbol is seen in a vision it has a directconnection to some magickal power, archetype, thought-form or entity. In order toget the greatest benefit out of your scrying, you must continually attempt to sensebeyond the visible or verbal symbol, extending your awareness along the path itprovides to apprehend that which it embodies.Accomplishing this is a delicate task. The relaxation exercises describedpreviously again become important, this time the portion of them dealing withquieting the mind. This is important in two ways: first, because the mind’s internalchatter will tend to overshadow and conceal that which is being communicatedthrough the symbol, and second, because active parts of the mind will attempt totwist the meaning of the symbol to fit with their own preconceptions.This is especially the case where the practitioner has personal desires thatrelate to the information being conveyed, or where the person’s self-image feelsthreatened. If your conception of yourself is dependent on a particular world-viewand the information does not accord with that view, it will be almost impossible foryou to see it clearly.To reduce the possibility of this happening, you should also work consciouslyto develop a mental state of unattachment towards the content of your visions, adeliberate disregard for any personal significance they contain, and a deliberaterefusal to evaluate the contents for truth or falsity. Critical evaluation of the results ofa scrying session is definitely necessary, but the time for that evaluation is after thesession is completed. While the work is proceeding, you should seek to be in aperfect state of suspended judgment; neither believing nor disbelieving anything thatyou see or sense, simply seeking to receive the symbols and their attached meaningsprecisely as they present themselves.When using scrying techniques in magickal work, you are always trying topenetrate unknown \"territory\". Any work that can result in a spiritual advance willbe, by definition, at least partly outside the scope of your current perspective andunderstanding. Like anything truly new, it takes the mind a while to adjust and beable to see it clearly. Further, the meanings behind any symbol can have manydifferent levels; it may take a long time for these to \"soak in\" to your awareness, andthe final significance may be very different from the first, superficial appearances. Inmy own work, it has sometimes taken up to a year and a half, with repeatedexposures, before I fully comprehended what I was being shown. Thus, no"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3877,1*\u0003<285\u00030$*,&.$/\u000363$&(\u000372\u0003:25.Ô\u0003\u0014\u0018\u0003evaluation you make should ever be so definite that you cannot change it or add to it;all meanings should be tentative until they have been repeatedly reinforced byadditional experiences.I cannot give any assurance as to the manner in which the meanings attachedto a symbol will appear to a particular person. I do not have enough informationfrom other people to characterize any particular way as \"typical\". In my own case,they come in two or three ways, depending on the amount of power I have managedto invoke and how high above my normal level of consciousness I have managed toraise my awareness.Usually, they appear as groups of thoughts or associations that appearsimultaneously in my mind with the words spoken by some entity, providing adetailed context for the words; it is as if the thoughts out of which the entityproduced the words were being transmitted along with the words. If I am looking at avisual symbol rather than hearing words, then they appear as sudden detailed\"realizations\" of what the symbol is intended to represent, which appear instantly inmy awareness.Less frequently, the hidden meaning of symbols appears as an entire storyline. A long series of events appear in the mind as if some part of myself had beentaken away, taken on a long tour through magickal spaces, and was then returned tothe exact moment in time from which it had left. The complete tour is instantly\"remembered\" as it happened, even though for my conscious awareness, no time atall has passed.In the rarest case, the meaning appears to my awareness as a tightly boundpacket of mystical energy, which sits in my mind and gradually \"unravels\" itself intowords, images, and meanings over a period ranging from minutes to weeks. These\"packets\" seem to be some magickal equivalent of books. Their content usually doesnot seem to be directed at the particular person receiving them, but rather at somegeneral audience; and the content is often radically different from the perspectivesand ideas the seer would normally be interested in.You should not take these as being the only ways in which the meaningsbehind symbols can present themselves to you; you may find that some other meansis more typical for you. But if you do happen to receive information in any of theseways, you can feel confident that you have had some success in this matter.The Magickal Mystery TourThe first scrying technique is very simple, and can be very entertaining. Theresults you get with this method can range from silly to sublime, frominconsequential to important, depending on the conditions of the moment. Thismethod lets you acquire a feel for the ways in which your unconscious mindsymbolizes things, and gives you some practice in doing so in a non-criticalsituation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0014\u0019\u0003Enter your magickal space and re-affirm your safety there, using the methodpreviously described. Then go to some familiar outdoor location in your space, andlook around to establish your bearings and the relative positions of the other familiarregions.Having done this, imagine that these familiar territories are surrounded byvast areas about which you know nothing as yet, in which anything at all might behappening at any given moment. Decide that you are going to take a walk and lookaround some part of those areas. Then look around you again, pick a direction, andstart walking. As you move out of your familiar areas, don’t try to imagine that youwill find any particular features in the landscape, and don’t try to look for anyparticular thing. Let the your imagination fill in the features of the areas you passthrough without interference.Move around in the wilderness until you find some interesting item. It mightbe an interesting natural feature, an object, a building, a person or animal. Examinethe object or explore the building, remembering that everything unusual has somesort of meaning in a magickal space. If nothing clear comes to you, move along inthe direction you were going. Sometimes it happens that several locations insequence tell a story that isn’t clear until you have been to all of them; other times,the first locations you come to are simply not very important.Talk to a person or animal as if they existed independently of yourself; treatthem with the respect and politeness you would give to any stranger you encounter inan isolated place. Try to maintain a friendly and unthreatening attitude no matterwhat the being does, and remember that since all this is taking place in your privateworld, you are perfectly safe. Don’t try to script their actions, just let them speak andact spontaneously. Asking a being you meet to tell you about itself and what it isdoing will nearly always get a positive response.If the being does not acknowledge your presence, or does not respond to yourqueries, then watch what they are doing for a time, until you don’t see any point incontinuing to do so. Then move on to another location. If they do respond, then whenyou have run out of questions ask them if there is anything else interesting to see inthe neighborhood, and follow any directions they might give you.Usually such explorations will tell you something about yourself, your life-situation, or the current conditions surrounding your magickal work. It will all be insymbolic form, of course; the obvious meaning of the events won’t always be theirdeepest significance. But once you understand the symbolism, the results usuallyturn out to be something useful or interesting, though not always important.This method is particularly good for those times when you know somethingimportant is going on in the magickal side of your life, but you can’t tell what it is. Itis also very good for any situation where you aren’t certain what questions youshould be asking. To use the method in such a way, hold the idea that you needinformation or answers in your mind while you are picking the direction for your"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"3877,1*\u0003<285\u00030$*,&.$/\u000363$&(\u000372\u0003:25.Ô\u0003\u0014\u001a\u0003tour, and try to sense the direction in which the answers lie; there will always be sucha direction. Then go in that direction and continue finding interesting things until youfeel like you have received all of the answer; this will usually manifest as a sense ofrelief or a reduction in some vaguely-sensed pressure. Then consider the things youhave seen in relation to your current situation; the meanings they contain will usuallyprovide essential clues you need.The Magick MirrorThe next method is very close to a \"classical\" scrying method, save that theappurtenances are astral rather than physical. The method is capable of endless varia-tions, of which only a few will be described.Pick a convenient location within your magickal space. If you intend to scryin conjunction with invocations of magickal forces, a consecrated temple ormagickal workroom would be the best place; otherwise, any place where you feelmost comfortable and secure.In that place, imagine a frame, as for a large mirror. This should be at leastyour own height, and of a width such that all of it can be in your field of vision at thesame time. Now imagine that this frame contains a sheet of glass. But rather thanbeing a silvered mirror the glass appears to contain a deep, transparent blackness; asif behind the glass were a void of indefinite extent.You can get an idea of the correct appearance -- and construct a physicalmagick mirror at the same time -- by taking a piece of half-silvered or quarter-silvered glass (from a scientific supply house) and laying it on a piece of good-quality black velvet. Look into this under very low illumination and it will seem tohave an indefinite depth; that is, it will seem to have depth, but you will be unable totell exactly how deep it is.You should at the same time imagine, and feel a total confidence, that theanswer to anything you look for will appear to you in this mirror. Don’t get boggeddown in how the mirror does this, simply generate an emotional confidence that itworks.The basic use of this mirror is fairly simple. You hold the thought of whatyou want to know about in your mind, and then you imagine that the mirror is\"tuning in\" to that thought, using the thought to make a connection to some placewhere the answer can be found. Once you feel that the mirror is tuned, release thethought and wait in mental silence for images to arise out of the darkness of themirror. And as with the \"mystery tour\" technique, the images will be accompaniedby meanings that you will be able to \"hear\" or sense in your mind.There are several variations on the basic method for different purposes. Onceyou get accustomed to the basic method, you can make use of those described orinvent your own. As you come to be familiar with the method, your own intuition"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0014\u001b\u0003will become a better guide to its use than any \"official\" technique; do not be afraid toexperiment.For psychometry, hold an object in your (physical) hand, and imagine thatthere is a link between it and the mirror. Then look to the mirror to reflect the\"impressions\" contained in the object. If it is an object that is connected by use tosome person, you must specify that it is impressions of the person that you want, notimpressions of the object itself; otherwise you may get some odd results. Forexample, I once tried to psychometrize a flint knife-blade, and got a geologicalhistory of the stratum from which the flint had come. Its connections to its rockyorigins were stronger than its connections to the persons who had made and used it,and these came across most intensely.You can also \"psychometrize\" a person -- give them a \"life reading\" oranswer specific questions -- by holding their hands and looking to your magickalmirror to reflect impressions you get from their spirit. This is more difficult, takesmore practice, and works best when you have no personal relationship with theperson in question. It should never be done with people with whom you have anemotional entanglement of any sort.To get basic ideas and meanings related to visual symbols, imagine thesymbol drawn on the face of the mirror in glowing lines. Then imagine that you arepushing the symbol into the mirror, so that it recedes in the distance and eventuallyvanishes from sight. Sending the symbol into the mirror \"tunes it in\"; wait in mentalsilence for images to arise, and these will bear in some way on the symbol.Magickal invocations can be used to enhance the power of the mirror. As anexample, you might want to explore the nature of the element of Fire. You couldbegin by performing the Lesser Pentagram ritual to banish extraneous influences,directing that the banishing include the mirror. Then you could use the GreaterPentagram ritual to invoke the element of Fire. When you have a strong sense of theelement’s force being present, direct that force into the mirror. Simultaneouslyimagine that the force is not only tuning the mirror to the element, but is alsocharging it up and clearing the channels so that the mirror works with its best effect.Or alternately, you could request that the archangel or angel of the element appear toyou in the mirror and answer your questions.With any of these methods, the images you get will at first be vague andstatic. But with practice the images will sharpen, expand and become active,presenting whole landscapes and long story lines that dramatically present theanswers you are seeking. The mirror will seem to become a window opening on thepart of the astral plane that relates to your search.Once you achieve this, the mirror can be used as a \"gate\", an opening throughwhich you can travel directly to the plane being viewed, to experience events therefirst-hand. From the standpoint of initiatory magick this is the preferred mode ofoperation, since it immerses your awareness in the power you are exploring."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"3877,1*\u0003<285\u00030$*,&.$/\u000363$&(\u000372\u0003:25.Ô\u0003\u0014\u001c\u0003Immersion increases the potential for real and lasting changes in awareness andenhances your power to achieve insights and realizations from the invoked power.To convert the mirror to a gate, imagine that the image in the mirror becomesthree-dimensional, as if you were actually looking through a window at a real placeinstead of just seeing a picture of it. Then imagine that the glass of the mirrordissolves and vanishes while the image in the mirror remains in place. Or if it iseasier for your mind, imagine that the glass is in fact a hinged window in a frame,and open the window.You will usually find that unless your being is totally in tune with the forceyou have invoked, you will have some difficulty passing through the frame and intothe world on the other side. The Golden Dawn’s \"Sign of the Enterer\" will help toovercome the resistance. Stand just short of arm’s length from the gate; raise yourarms directly above your head, and then bring them down and forward with thefingers straight, while at the same time taking a step forward. Alternately, pull yourhands back so that they are close to your body at shoulder level, and then extendyour arms sharply forward while taking the step. Imagine that these gestures arepunching a hole in whatever is resisting your entry, and that the momentum of yourforward movement is carrying you through the gate and into the world beyond. Ifyou still feel resistance once you are through the gate, repeat the gestures again.Once you are though the gate, look around and make note of everything yousee. Start with the major features of the landscape, then focus in on the details. If youhave invoked the power correctly, you should see objects and events that reflect partsof the power’s nature.It is good practice to test the world you enter, and any beings you encounter,to ensure that they are in fact related to the power you invoked, and are of a goodnature. The means of testing will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.If you find that you have difficulty turning the mirror into a gate, or that themirror won’t give you images of complete landscapes and story lines, a variation onthe magickal practice of pathworking will help. The practice as described below ishalfway between scrying a simple symbol and doing a freeform exploration of aninvoked force, and will thus assist in the transition between them.PathworkingThe term \"pathworking\" is used for several different practices, ranging fromsimple meditations through programmed visualizations to visions and astral travel.What they all have in common is the use of symbols traditionally associated with the\"paths\" of the Tree of Life, e.g., the Tarot trumps. These symbols have been in usefor long enough that stable regions reflecting their power have been established inthe inner planes. By using the symbols in these practices the person connects to thoseregions and can learn something of the realities behind the symbols."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0003Preliminary Steps1. Pick a visual symbol for the path you want to explore. Tarot cards are goodstarting points. The cartoon-like images of the Rider or Wang decks are preferable todetailed images like Crowley’s deck; the bright, flat colors of these cards encourageyour imagination to fill in the blanks. We’ll use the Rider deck’s \"Fool\" card as anexample.2. Review what you know about the correspondences of the card. Read whatyour available sources have to say about the card. Then go on to some unconnectedactivity for a while and let your unconscious absorb the information; let it make itsown connections and conclusions without any effort by your conscious self.Using the example card, what comes immediately to my mind: The Fool isgenerally attributed to the element of Air and the path of Aleph. In the Golden Dawnversion of the Tree, the path of Aleph connects Kether with Chokmah. In Achad’sversion of the Tree, it connects Malkuth with Yesod. The Fool is a primal form ofAir, more cosmic and less \"earthy\" than the Tarot suit of Swords. In the cabala, itrepresents both the \"mind\" or \"intellect\" aspect of being and the Yetziratic,\"formative\", or \"Son\" aspect of the IHVH sequence. In the Enochian elementalsequence it represents the creative Ideal manifested by the divine, which is the basisfor further development and full manifestation through the other elements. In thestructure of the planet Earth, it is the atmosphere which lies between the spirit-aspectof the planet’s magnetosphere and the water-aspect of the oceans. And so on.3. Study the card and note the details, and also note any connections thatcome to mind. Consider the figure in the card; what does his/her posture, gestures,expression, etc. say about his attitude and emotional state? Where does his attentionseem focused? Try to get some idea of the type of personality being expressed.Ex: The cliff on which the Fools stands seems to be colored using three of theMalkuth colors: black, olive, and russet. The Fool’s boots are citrine, completing thefoursome. The mountains in the background are in a Yesodic violet, with snowy topsreflecting the light of the Sun, which is colored in Kether’s white. The sky, dominantin the picture, is an Airy yellow, slightly darker than the citrine of his boots.The Fool’s outer garment is green with ivy patterns, reminding me of theGreen Man of Celtic mythology and Malkuth again. The lining is red, reminiscent ofboth Fire and the sexual energy of Mars. There are wheels embroidered on thegarment, which brings to mind another card, The Wheel of Fortune, attributed toJupiter, who is Lord of the Air. There are also Fleur-de-Lys on the garment, whichare either Lilies (Malkuth, according to Crowley) or Irises (Yesodic by color andshape).His inner garment is white, again suggesting Kether. A feather is mounted atthe front of his hat, and its shape suggests the Uraeus serpent of Egyptian costume,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"3877,1*\u0003<285\u00030$*,&.$/\u000363$&(\u000372\u0003:25.Ô\u0003\u0015\u0014\u0003or the feather of Maat. He carries a rose in his left hand and a staff with a bag at theend (rather phallic) in his right.The Fool’s head is bent back, his eyes focused on something in the distancethat only he can see. His posture is somewhat pretentiously \"sensitive\", the sort thatyou would see the French Sun-King use in one of his dances. Overall he reminds meof a Galliard poet of the 13th century, a noble’s over-educated younger son,wandering and pretending to be a minstrel while eschewing mundane tasks. He isabout to walk over a cliff. The dog at his heels seems either playful or trying to callhis attention to his immediate danger.You don’t have to go into such detail as in the example; if you are juststarting out in magick, you probably won’t have the resources to do it. The importantthing is to note the details, and try and interpret the figure’s expression and posture,and the acts in which he seems to be engaged.These first three steps are preparatory, and should be done before beginningthe main part of the practices. Once you have done them, let the information float inyour unconscious for a few hours or a day while you do other things. The idea is togently focus the unconscious on the subject matter, and to let it absorb theinformation and ideas without your conscious interference. This makes it morewilling to participate in the practices, and enhances its ability to make connectionswith the magickal region behind the card.Main Practice4. Sit down and do the relaxation exercises, as described in the earliersection.5. Place the card in front of you so that you can look at it without strainingyour eyes or changing your relaxed position. Look at the card without deliberatelyfocusing on any one point; let your eyes move from point to point within the picturein their normal scanning motion.6. Now enter your magickal space and get your awareness firmly establishedthere. Go to the place where your magick mirror is located and stand where you canview it head-on. Imagine the image from the Tarot card in the mirror, so that itcompletely fills the frame. Then look at the landscape in the picture; think of what itwould look like if it were real and not just a cartoon image. Try to see the image as athree-dimensional world behind the glass of the mirror. Think about the parts of thelandscape that are hidden beyond the window frame and fill them in. Keep the colorsmore or less the same, but fill in the details; build up a picture as if that world were areal place that you can see. Feel free to incorporate details of real places you haveseen in your life. (But DON’T use real people as models for the figures.)Ex: The mountains in the Fool card remind me of the Swiss Alps, violet-tinted rock with permanent snow-cover at their summits. I fill in the picture with theappropriate details of ravines, rockslides, etc. The cliff on which the fool stands"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0015\u0015\u0003looks to me as if it is some sort of moss-covered granite, and the sharpness of thedrop suggests that a glacier carved it out. The same glacier would have carved adeep, rounded valley below, and I imagine it being there, with fields of grass andcopses of pine and fir trees, perhaps with the rooftops of a village small in thedistance.The Fool is walking towards the window, so there must be a trail down intothe valley hidden behind the outcrop. I imagine a trail following a curve upwardsaround the end of the valley to end at the outcrop. I imagine this outcrop is on theside of a mountain the summit of which is somewhere to the right of the visible area.7. Next, imagine that you have jumped through the window frame and arestanding in the world you have been looking at, but at some moment in time justbefore the living figures of the card appeared on the scene. Don’t try to move throughthe mirror, just make an instant transition to the place you just imagined. If you haveto, build the landscape up again from scratch, but with you inside it.Turn around and look at the surroundings from your new viewpoint; get a360-degree view, and fill in the parts of the landscape that were behind your originalview through the window. (The window, incidentally, should not be visible.)Imagine what your other senses would tell you if you were in a similar physicallocation, and add those in to your impressions of this place.Ex: Looking back towards the window’s position I note that the mountainsget lower in that direction, and gradually fall off into rolling farmlands in the fardistance. A large lake (like Lake Lucern or Geneva) can be seen just at the edge ofvisibility. I can see the mountain on whose side I stand, and can see directly the pathI had previously imagined behind the outcrop. This path comes up to my currentposition, then curves around the mountain and up to a pass in the middle distance.Looking down into the valley below, I see that there are light clouds between thevillage and myself, giving the impression that I am in a world above the normalworld. I can feel and hear the wind blowing around me, and there are faint scents ofpine, grass, and flinty rock in the air, as well as an ozone-tinge of freshness. Faintsounds of human activity come from the village.8. Spend some time getting the scene and your viewpoint firmly in yourimagination. Don’t worry if details change or shift, and don’t expend any effort tryingto change them back. Just get the major outlines and positions firm and let the smalldetails change as they will. Think of how places look in your regular daydreams;often there is very little detail, and what detail is there is more often implied thanactually seen. As you continue the practice over weeks or months, your unconsciouswill gradually learn to fill them in and keep them steady without conscious effort.9. The next step is in some ways the most difficult, and in some ways theeasiest. We have all had daydreams in which we invented face-saving dialogs forsome embarrassing past occurrence in our life. In others, we imagined the events andinteractions we would like to see happen in some future meeting, or some situation"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"3877,1*\u0003<285\u00030$*,&.$/\u000363$&(\u000372\u0003:25.Ô\u0003\u0015\u0016\u0003we would like to be in but cannot attain in the mundane world. What you do in thisstep is basically the same. The only difference is that you shouldn’t have anyparticular desire to control what the other characters say, but instead want to seewhat they say of themselves.What you want to do is imagine a scenario by which the Tarot card’s personarrives at the location where you are standing, and begins to converse with you.Using our example, you could think that you hear someone singing in the distancebehind you. You turn and look down the trail, and see the fool climbing it, followedby his dog. He sings a cheery tune as he walks. As he comes close enough to hearyou, you call out and wave to him; he looks up and waves back. He comes closer andsteps onto the escarpment where you stand. He smiles and walks to the edge of thecliff, looking outwards. He stretches his arms and takes a deep breath of the freshmountain air, and for a moment he is posed in exactly the way he is shown on theTarot card. Then he turns to you and asks, \"Where away, traveller?\"The idea behind this is to give your unconscious mind a credible reason forbelieving you to be in a situation where you can talk to the card’s character. The partof your unconscious that touches the imagination doesn’t believe in hypotheticalsituations; to it, things are either real or they aren’t, but anything that is reasonablyconsistent will be accepted as real. This part of your unconscious mind plays thecharacter’s part while your conscious mind plays yourself. This same part reaches outinto other parts of your minds and into the magickal realms and pulls in informationto use in building it’s characterization.9. Now that the character is present, you can ask him questions about himself,the various symbols of his clothing and appurtenances, and about the environment inwhich you find yourselves. Always act as if the character were a real person,independent of yourself. Treat him with the respect of equals; never act superior tohim, and never, ever threaten. If he doesn’t want to answer a particular question,don’t press. Answer any questions he poses honestly, to the best of your ability. Butat the same time don’t allow yourself to be threatened or cowed; demand that yourinteractions be on a basis of equality and nothing else.Another thing to remember is that in this phase of the exercise there are nowrong results, only results you don’t understand. If something seems out of placewith the nature of the card, don’t reject it. Simply admit that you don’t understandand file it away for later consideration. Generally you should follow along withwhatever happens; there is no way you can be hurt, so there is no reason not to do so.10. When you start to tire, or the character indicates he has had enough, it istime to end the exercise. Say goodbye to the character, turn and walk away until he isout of sight. Then \"jump\" back through your magick mirror and turn around; see thepoint you just jumped from through the mirror, even if this is not the same point thatwas there at the start. Then imagine closing the mirror so that it only shows its usualdeep blackness."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0015\u0017\u0003After leaving your magickal space again, spend a few moments focusing yourattention on various objects in your physical environment. Get up and walk around,stretch yourself, get a drink or go to the bathroom, or some other mundane task.Then sit down again and write down what happened during the exercise, in as muchdetail as you can. Record what was said, any ideas that happened to pop into yourmind, and any changes in the scenery or movements into other scenes.It sometimes happens that unexpected things occur during this exercise. Forinstance, the character might come up behind you and say hello while you are stillworking on the landscape. Usually it’s best to go along with these happenings ratherthan insist on following the various stages in order.Once the character appears, then the rule is to allow whatever wants tohappen, as in the \"mystery tour\" exercise. You should not worry much about keepingthe environs steady. The character might change the landscape to make a point, orintroduce creatures or objects. Other things might appear and disappearspontaneously. You sometimes find yourself and the character transported to anentirely different scene. All these things are acceptable, and should be taken in aspirit of non-judgmental interest. Remember that the logic of visions is the logic ofdreams, where such events are not at all unusual.After you have worked with this method for a week or two using variousTarot images, try again to invoke a force using a ceremony and getting a responsethrough your mirror.

If you still have trouble, try combining theinvocation with an appropriate Tarot image."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Ô\u0003\u0015\u0018\u0003Chapter 4.Testing your visionsIt is usually a good idea to apply tests to the images you get in scrying, and tothe various beings you might encounter. The ultimate test is, of course, a criticalappraisal of the quality, consistency, and value of the results you get from yourwork; but that test can only be applied after the work is done. Other methods allowyou to get some sense of whether there is something wrong at an early point in thesession. You can then take appropriate efforts to correct the problem, or if necessaryend the session and save your energy for another time.The most reliable testing method makes use of the symbols in the GoldenDawn’s Greater Pentagram and Greater Hexagram rituals. But the effectiveness ofthe method requires that you have some experience in performing those rituals, andin getting a good response from them. If you are not already experienced in their use,you should practice using them in your magickal space for a while beforeimplementing this testing procedure.A limitation of this method is that it only works where the powers beingscryed are among the traditional, conventional powers used in magick. That is, thepowers are elemental, planetary, or zodiacal in nature. Where the nature of a poweris unknown, or it is of an inherently mixed nature, other methods must be applied.After attaining a steady image of some magickal region in your mirror, youdraw the invoking pentagram or hexagram appropriate to the power you invoked,using white lines in the air in front of you. Vibrate the god-names of the power acouple of times, then cast the symbol into the mirror. If the mirror is correctly\"tuned\" to the power, the pentagram or hexagram will be absorbed and will eitherhave no effect, or will cause the image to become sharper and brighter. If the imagebecomes darker, becomes distorted, or breaks up entirely, then you know thatsomething is wrong; you should banish and start over.Similarly, if you have used the mirror as a gate and entered into some region,you should cast the appropriate symbol against any object that appears prominent inthe area, and always against any being who appears to serve as your guide. In eitherof these cases, the being or object should show no effect, or should grow brighter,larger, or more solid as a result of the contact. A false or deceptive being will shrink,or its appearance will become distorted, or it will disappear.No magickal being worth speaking to will ever object to being tested in thisway. There is no reason that it should, since by doing the test you are, effectively,blessing it. If a being attempts to convince you to not do the tests, that in itself is asign that something is wrong."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0015\u0019\u0003Note that you should always use the invoking pentagram or hexagram fortests, never the banishing versions. Using a banishing figure is the same ascommanding the forces you invoked to disperse again, nullifying your efforts.Two secondary types of testing seem to depend in some way on the magicianhaving an intent that they will work correctly; there is no obvious reason why theyshould work, but they usually do, just the same. The first of these is the use of theG.D. grade signs; the second is the use of the Hebrew letters of the planets.The idea behind the use of the Grade Signs in scrying is the same as their usein Masonic rituals and greetings. By displaying a sign to a spirit you encounter, youclaim a right to the \"secrets\" of that grade and its corresponding element. The spiritshould answer back by repeating the sign, thus showing that it is also qualified todeal with the secrets of that grade. (Illustrations of the Grade Signs can be found inCrowley’s Liber O, and in Regardie’s The Golden Dawn.)If a spirit can perform the appropriate sign for the invoked element, thisindicates that your vision is on-track. If the spirit cannot perform it, performs itimproperly, or its form becomes distorted, this is an indication that something iswrong. However, it is not necessarily proof that you are dealing with a deceivingspirit, particularly if the same spirit has already passed the pentagram/hexagram test.Rather, it is more likely that there is insufficient magickal power present for yourcommunication to be clear. The best course is to vibrate the divine names for thepower you are invoking several times, and then repeat the signs again. Only if thespirit is still unable to perform the signs correctly should you end the session.The exchanging of signs also contains an implicit agreement between youand the spirit being tested. That is, by doing this you are agreeing to deal with thespirit on a basis of equality and brotherhood, neither dominating that spirit nor beingsubject to it. You are also acknowledging that both of you are \"members of the samefraternity\", operating within the general community of workers seeking to alignthemselves with \"god\" (or with divinity in whatever form you conceive of it). Youshould never try to exchange signs with a being you know is not within thatcommunity, or with which you must maintain a position of dominance -- e.g., ademon or a true \"elemental\". Conversely, you should never try to dominate a spiritwith whom you have exchanged signs; assume instead that it will assist you willinglyand without coercion, and treat it with the same respect that you would wish it togive you.It sometimes happens that in answering your sign, the spirit will add othersigns after repeating the one you used. This is an indication that the spirit is of amixed elemental nature, or is intrinsically of a higher \"grade\" than that at which youare working. As an example of the first case, if you were invoking an angel from oneof the Lesser Angles of the Enochian Tablet of Earth, you would perform the sign ofSet. The angel would be expected to respond with the same sign, but if it were anangel of the Lesser Angle of Fire, it might add the sign of Fire (the goddess Thoum-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"7(67,1*\u0003<285\u00039,6,216Ô\u0003\u0015\u001a\u0003aesch-Neith) as well. As an example of the latter case, a Senior from the Earth Tabletmight add the LVX signs after the sign of Set.The LVX signs are a special case. Their use indicates that the spirit is alignedwith the divinity, is of a \"good\" character; but does not test for any particularelemental or planetary nature. They should be used in conjunction with theappropriate hexagrams for testing spirits related to the planets or zodiac, or in anycase where the benevolence of the spirit is in doubt. All of the Enochian angels willbe able to perform these signs, as will any Hebrew-system archangel.There are no Grade Signs specifically associated with the planets in theGolden Dawn system; one must make do with the LVX signs, and these are usuallysufficient. However, those who wish to assemble a set of elegant and effectiveplanetary gestures for testing spirits should consult Planetary Magick by MelittaDenning and Osborn Phillips.The final form of testing is, in my opinion, the least reliable. I do not use itmyself, preferring to trust my own judgment. But I note it for those who might wishto experiment with it.The Golden Dawn adepts acknowledged that in this sort of work there isalways a danger that the visions one sees will not be a true reflection of the forcesinvoked, but may rather be constructions or projections of the seer’s own mind andemotions. They classified these projections according to an association with theplanets:TypePlanetHebrew letterTarot TrumpMemorySaturn (as Time)\u001c TavThe WorldConstructionJupiter, KaphWheel of FortuneAngerMars1 PehTowerVanity or egoSun3 ReshThe SunPleasureVenus% DalethThe EmpressImaginationMercury# BethThe MagicianWanderingthoughtsLuna( GimelThe PriestessThe theory is that if you suspect that one of these factors may be influencingyour vision, you can project an image of the corresponding Hebrew letter or TarotTrump into the scene. It will cause the scene to darken, diminish, or disappear if thescene is in fact the sort of projection you suspect it to be.My personal feeling is that introducing extraneous powers into a vision inthis way will cause more problems than they will solve. As well, it seems to me thatinvocation of a force related to a type of projection would tend to enhance theprojection rather than eliminating it. However, this may not be the case for you; try itif you wish and see if it works."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0015\u001b\u0003"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Ô\u0003\u0015\u001c\u0003Chapter 5.Scrying with the Enochian MagickThere are several considerations for Enochian magick work that do not applyto scrying using other systems. The first of these is the unquestionable power of theCalls and the divine and angelic names. As Crowley once said, other systems requireeffort; Enochian magick requires caution. While the power built up in any onesession is almost never of an unmanageable level, some effects of the magick tend toaccumulate across sessions; it is easy for an overeager beginner to get in deeper thanhe expects. Added to this, the powers invoked through the Calls seem to enter intothe magician’s field of awareness along some spiritual dimension that is outside thosethat we consider \"normal\". It seems to operate through some sort of meta-space withqualities different from those that compose the magickal worlds to which we areaccustomed.The consequence of these factors is that any work with the magick places acertain amount of stress on the magician’s mind and body, and over-use can lead tovarious stress-related forms of illness. Anyone working regularly with the magickshould keep an eye out for signs of this stress in himself. The typical symptoms aresimilar to those that come from abusing methedrine or \"speed\": nervous exhaustion,severely lowered immune response, inability to concentrate, hypersensitivity, hyper-reactivity, reduced judgment, flights of ideas, and paranoia.One time in my own career, the stress of overusing this magick combinedwith an equally stressful mundane occupation to give me the worst of both thephysical and mental consequences. On the physical side, I contracted mononucleosis,effectively stopping all my magickal work for six months or so. On the mental side,the changed viewpoint and loss of judgment caused me to make seditious remarks toa class of Federal employees I was training, resulting in the loss of my livelihood.So caution is well justified. But with a few easy, obvious precautions, theseproblems can be avoided.• Avoid using the magick at times when other parts of your life are unusuallystressful. Try to arrange your affairs so as to reduce the social and economicpressures to the minimum level compatible with your needs.• Get regular exercise; a healthy body handles stress better.• Don’t use recreational drugs while working with the magick. Aside frombeing illegal (jail is a poor place for magickal work), all of them add to thestress on your body. Most stimulants and sedatives also reduce your magickalsensitivity and ability to focus in your magickal space. Hallucinogens makeyou too sensitive, and reduce your level of control.• Learn to pace yourself. When first starting out, allow a day or two betweenEnochian invocations to absorb the results and \"cool off\". Later, when you"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0016\u0013\u0003get to the point where you need to accumulate power over several day’s worthof invocations, allow at least as many days off after the series as you spent inworking. Take longer vacations from the work every few months to keepyourself grounded.The importance of pacing yourself cannot be overemphasized. When youbegin getting significant results from your Enochian work, it is very tempting to keepgoing; the anticipation of even more amazing results drives you on. But the extra-dimensional or meta-dimensional character of these forces allows them to influenceall levels of your being simultaneously, including many levels of which you are notconsciously aware. The cumulative effects of this influence can cascade into adangerous level of stress before you become aware of it. Regular intervals of rest andrelaxation, and of immersion in the everyday world, are the only sure way to avoidthe problems.Another difficulty, which bears more directly on scrying, is that the Callsallow you to invoke a force without having any knowledge of its nature. In normalmethods of invocation, one begins with a symbol or set of symbols, and seeks bytheir use to bring about the manifestation of the corresponding powers. The symbolsyou use define the power to be invoked. In contrast, the Calls produce amanifestation of power regardless of whether you comprehend their symboliccontent.Adding to the confusion is the fact that, from a perspective accustomed to thetraditional magickal powers (i.e., the elements, planets, and zodiac) the nature of theinvoked powers seems to change depending on the depth of one’s penetration intotheir realms. Or from another angle, the Calls and Names open up different realms,depending on the level of initiation at which you are operating. On the mostsuperficial level, they appear more or less \"elemental\" in nature, with an overlayrelated to the functions of the angels’ specific offices. But at \"deeper\" or \"higher\"levels, this elemental aspect fades, to be replaced by a succession of increasinglycomplex and inclusive expressions that may bear little or no relation to the mostsuperficial appearance.Unless the magician supplies an explicit set of symbols to which the invokedpowers can be anchored, the powers will tend to remain in an indeterminate state; asort of \"fuzzy cloud\" of energy which contains all the power’s potential expressions,but which manifests none of them explicitly. A visual symbol used as an anchorcauses this indeterminacy to \"collapse\" into that aspect of the power which is mostnearly similar to the symbol’s innate associations. The congruency between thesymbol and the invoked power does not have to be very great. It is sufficient thatsome small aspect of the symbol’s associations be similar to the power’s; the majorassociations of the symbol can be entirely inappropriate, and this collapse will stilloccur.So the symbol the scryer uses will determine, in part, the initial manifestationof an invoked Enochian power; the scryer’s expectations or preconceptions of the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"6&5<,1*\u0003:,7+\u00037+(\u0003(12&+,$1\u00030$*,&.Ô\u0003\u0016\u0014\u0003power’s nature will also be partially determining. This accounts for the documentedfact that different magicians have produced widely varying -- sometimes evencontradictory -- results using the system. However, it is my observation that withrepeated invocations and scryings, the true nature of the invoked power will breakthrough these initial, superficial expressions. The longer you work with a particularEnochian power, the more closely your results will accord with that nature, and thedeeper you will penetrate into the realms to which the power connects.Since penetration past the sometimes-deceiving surface manifestations takestime, orderly, methodical work habits are necessary to get the most value of yourEnochian work. The fact that invocations have a cumulative effect can be used toadvantage if you plan out your course ahead of time, and stick to it. The followingsuggestions will all enhance the effectiveness of your Enochian scryings:• For every angel or other power that you invoke, do several scrying sessions.Allow time for a connection to be built up between you and the angel, and foryour mind to become accustomed to its power.• Work for an extended period solely with powers from a single Tablet. Or ifyou are working with the Aethyrs or the 91 Parts of the Earth, pick a set ofcontiguous Aethyrs or Parts and do them sequentially.• If you are invoking single squares of some angelic or divine name, plan to doall the squares of that name in sequence.• Plan out a series of invocations to investigate all the angels of a given rankwithin one of the Tablets, in some logical sequence. Complete the series be-fore working with any other rank or Tablet. Alternately, plan out a series toinvestigate all the powers within a given Lesser Angle, in order of rank.A Magickal Space for Enochian ScryingSince the Enochian powers are so sensitive to the visual symbols in amagickal space, the general-purpose magickal space developed in the precedingsections of this paper is likely to be inappropriate for Enochian work. The profusionof objects with which you have populated the landscape would all tend to anchor theforces in unexpected or undesired forms. A space with a more neutral visualappearance needs to be used.A woman I once met made a habit of surveying people about the appearanceof their magickal spaces. Amusingly, nearly all the Enochian magicians she knew(most of whom did not know the others) had chosen to build essentially identicalspaces for their work. This space might thus be considered an archetypal Enochianworkplace. It consists of a broad, gray plain, surrounded at the horizon by low hills;both plain and hills are illuminated in a flat, sourceless light of relatively lowintensity. Overhead, there is a night-sky filled with stars. The plain is large enoughthat the magician always has an unused area available in which to perform a newseries of invocations."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0016\u0015\u0003The remaining few magicians in her survey had chosen to go even further inthe direction of minimalism than this Michael Moorcock landscape. Theirworkspaces consisted solely of a clear space within a gray mist, with a featurelessgray floor underneath, created ab initio for every invocation.My feeling is that the plain has a slight advantage as a workspace. It allowsfor the establishment of long-term or permanent structures, useful for advancedworks in which the invocations must be done in section, or for building a templeappropriate to a range of Enochian works.Scrying Techniques for Enochian MagickBoth the \"magick mirror\" technique and its extension as a \"gate\" work aswell with Enochian powers as they will with other, more conventional magickalpowers. I would recommend that you create a new mirror in your Enochianworkplace for every series of invocations that you do, and destroy it after completingthe series. Since the Enochian powers tend to accumulate over time, this preventsresidual forces from previous works from interfering with a new work.However, as mentioned above, it is often necessary to provide a firm visualanchor for Enochian powers; you may find that the mirror technique is insufficientlyexact, and only gives you confused or contradictory results. If that is the case, one ofthe following methods will be more effective.The Golden Dawn devised a technique for using visualizations of truncatedpyramids as the starting point for explorations of individual squares from the Tablets.This practical method has been proven by use to be very effective, precisely becauseit provides a well-defined symbolic \"anchor\" for the Enochian powers. I recommendthis technique for beginners, both for this reason and because it tends to focus thepowers into their most \"earthly\", most readily comprehensible form.The basic technique is to build a truncated pyramid in your magickal space.The flat top has an area one-ninth the area of its base. The relative sizes of the topand bottom means the sides are tilted inwards at an angle of forty-five degrees. Theletter of the square is visualized on the flat top. The sides of the pyramid are coloredand labeled with symbols and images according to a complex system of attributes.(The G.D. system of attributes is described in detail in Book Four ofRegardie’s The Golden Dawn; my own alternate system (which I believe to be asubstantial improvement over the G.D. system) is described in the papers titled\"Godzilla Meets E.T.\". The pyramid method works very well with either system.)The pyramid is visualized as being large enough to stand on the top. Havingvibrated the appropriate Calls for the name in which the square lies, the magicianthen stands on top of the pyramid in his astral body, and vibrates the hierarchy ofnames. As he vibrates each name, the magician imagines the power of that namegathering around the pyramid."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"6&5<,1*\u0003:,7+\u00037+(\u0003(12&+,$1\u00030$*,&.Ô\u0003\u0016\u0016\u0003When the last name is vibrated, the magician imagines that each side of thepyramid is gathering in the attracted energy, each taking the type appropriate to itsattributes and symbols. This energy is seen moving upwards, being focused as it goesby the narrowing of the sides. The flows of energy from the sides reach the topsimultaneously, run into each other, and form a beam of light shining up andoutwards into the astral worlds, forming a path to a region of magickal spacegoverned by the square. The magician then follows this beam in his astral body untila landscape or other scene forms around him. This scene should symbolize variousaspects of the square invoked. From that point, the techniques describe earlier can beused to explore the region.I prefer a variation of this method, in which the magician stands inside thepyramid. When the energies traveling up the sides reach the top, they come togetheron the letter and then shine downwards into the pyramid, illuminating the interior.The angel governing the square is invoked to visible appearance within the pyramidand is tested there. After testing, the angel conducts the magician to various scenesthat illustrate the square’s nature.Since a session using this technique only explores the power of one letter ofan angel’s name, you only get a partial view of the angel’s nature. To fullyunderstand an angel, all the letters of its name should be explored in sequence.When you wish to invoke all of an angel’s powers at once rather than a singleletter, it is more convenient to make your anchoring image something like amagickal circle, or a talisman sufficiently large that you can stand on it. A exampledesign for such a circle would have the divine names superior to the given angelwritten around the rim of the circle. The name of the angel being invoked would bewritten within the circle, oriented so that it appears upright when you are facing inthe direction in which you want the angel to appear. If the angel is associated with aparticular magickal formula (e.g., Kerubic angels and the INRI formula) symbolsappropriate to that formula might also be drawn within the circle.Note that the intent of this figure is much closer in function to a talisman thanto the traditional idea of a magickal circle. It is not intended to block off its interiorfrom the exterior areas; you should feel free to move in and out of it at will. Nor is itintended to \"contain\" the invoked force. Rather, the idea is that the charged figurewill serve to attract the attention of the appropriate being -- like putting a bigilluminated sign saying \"Land Here!\" next to a runway. It also serves to condition thesurrounding magickal space so that it reflects the nature of the invoked powers.Vibrate the appropriate Calls several times; then enter the magickal space andcreate the circle. Vibrate the divine and angelic names, and as you feel the invokedpower arrive, direct it into the lines and letters in the circle so that they glow and re-radiate the power to the surrounding environment. Keep vibrating the names until theintensity of invoked power seems to level off, then vibrate only the name of thebeing you wish to contact, asking it to appear before you. Vibrate the angel’s nameuntil it does appear; then apply the tests, and ask the angel what you will."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"$\u00036+257\u0003&2856(\u0003,1\u00036&5<,1*Ô\u0003\u0016\u0017\u0003Calling the angel to the circle is my personal preference; I would rather havethe guide take me to the place I want to go than go there first and find a guideafterwards. The reverse may be more comfortable for you. If that is the case, you canvary the above method by concentrating the invoked force in the circle instead ofallowing it to radiate. Then imagine that the force is creating a \"gate\" to the power’smagickal space; imagine the center of the circle opening up as the magick mirror didin the earlier exercises, so that you can step directly through it into that space. Or youcan imagine that the powers form a beam of light shooting up from the circle, whichyou can ride to the powers’ space. "}]
