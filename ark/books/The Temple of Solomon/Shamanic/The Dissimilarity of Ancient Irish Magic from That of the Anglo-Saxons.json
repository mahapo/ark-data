BY WILFRID BONSER, PH.D., HON. LIBRARIAN. ONE would have expected, from the nearness of Ireland and of Scotland to England, that Celtic magic would be found to have had much influence on Anglo-Saxon magic, but, upon examination, this proves not to have been the case. Many parallels exist between both Irish and Welsh charms and magical practices on the one hand and Anglo-Saxon on the other, but the evidence points merely to a common source for these, and not to direct contact, for the two branches in themselves are entirely different. This is to be accounted for partly, (a), by difference in the tone of Irish literature and culture,-for Anglo-Saxon magic never attained to such flights of imagination as did the Irish; (b), by the fact that in Ireland there was a highly organised class,-the druids,-who, among other vocations, were professional magicians, but who did not exist at all in Anglo-Saxon England; (c), by the fact that all previous magical practices had been stamped out during the Anglo-Saxon conquest; and, (d), by the extreme difference in language. The Irish culture was wholly different from that of the Anglo-Saxons, and any influence, apart from isolated charms which have survived in a corrupt form (see below), that may have reached England with Columba and Aidan from the north, was no longer traceable when written records of Anglo-Saxon culture appear. \" It is impossible,\" 271 This content downloaded from 131.230.73.202 on Tue, 24 Dec 2013 19:44:57 PMAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"272 The Dissimilarity of Ancient Irish Magic says A. G. van Hamel,' \"to discover in Anglo-Saxon poetry any direct allusion to Irish poems: . . . in the same way there is no proof that the Anglo-Saxons were ac- quainted with the Irish prose-tales.\" The same is the case with history, and from a comparison of the Irish Annals with the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica, \" it appears that neither Bede and his pre- cursors. nor the scribes of the Chronicle ... ever had a look at an Irish annalistic work.\" On the other hand, the same writer notes that \" a still more important fact \" for his argument \" is that in all those Irish annals there also occurs a list of entries relating to Anglo-Saxon history.\" The same probably obtains with regard to magic. The Irish druids formed a hierarchy for the performance, inter alia, of magical practices in heathen times, and the Christian church peaceably supplanted them. The Irish kings were often converted first (outwardly, at any rate), and their people followed suit; whence the saying that there were no martyr saints in Ireland. There are even instances of the conversion of druids to Christianity.2 Bertrand 3 suggests that some at least of the schools and monasteries 1 \" The Foreign Notes in the Three Fragments of the Irish Annals,\" Revue Celtique, tom. xxxvi (1915), pp. 1-2. Bede, however, chronicles the mission of St. Columba (from Ireland) to the northern Picts in 565, and the conversion of the southern Picts by Ninian, (Eccles. Hist., iii. 4), the building of a monastery in Ireland by Colman, A.D. 667, (Eccles. Hist., iv. 4), and that St. Fursey (A.D. 633), came from Ireland to England, where his soul quitted his body (in true druidical fashion) for purposes of travel during sleep, (see below), (Eccles. Hist., iii. g19). The A nglo-Saxon Chronicle under the year 891 says that \"three Scots came to King Alfred in a boat without any oars . .. which was wrought of two hides and a half \" from Ireland on a pilgrimage. Miss Hull tells me that \" In this year [921] King Sihtric slew Niel \" [i.e. Niall Glundubh] is also an Irish reference. The old Irish chronicles were written partly in Latin and partly in Irish; Bede and the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle could have drawn from the Latin portions, but the Irish was unreadable by them. 2 Plummer, Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae, vol. i, p. clxiv. 3 Religion des Gaulois, pp. 388-9.

In England the case was different. Roman polytheism was superimposed upon the older magical practices of this island,4 and what may have survived of the combination was stamped out at the Saxon conquest,-which, as Gildas shows, was far from being a peaceable taking over of customs. \" Between Roman Britain and Saxon England,\" says Haverfield, \" there is a great gulf fixed.\" 5 The Saxons derived, broadly speaking, nothing from the previous inhabitants of this island, and the magical prac- tices which are found among them were imported either with them or by them. Anglo-Saxon magic and charms survive to-day with Christian veneer. The magical practices of druidical Ireland survived in miraculous acts of the various Christian saints. But these, which have been summarized and digested by Mr. Plummer,\" are much more varied and fantastic than anything that remains of Anglo-Saxon magic,-here again the two have but little in common. For instance, Christian psalms and hymns act as charms for protection on a journey, \" either making the protected persons wholly invisible, or causing them to appear in a different form to their enemies.\" I Such things are carried by the Anglo-Saxons for protection on a journey, but there is never any idea of invisibility for the wearer. There is a closer resemblance between Celtic and Finnish ideas in this particular than there is between Celtic and Anglo-Saxon. The Celtic goes much farther, and more far-reaching results are looked for. The Tuatha De Danann were accredited with great magical powers by their successors, 4 F.

That of New Grange is perhaps the most familiar, and this was traditionally Brugh of the Boyne, the fairy-palace of Angus Oge, the son of the Dagda, \" the wisest and most skilled in magic of all the Dedannan race.\" \" The druids,\" says Joyce,8 \" were the intermediaries with the fairies and with the invisible world in general for good or evil; and they could protect people from the malice of evil-disposed spirits of every kind; which explains much of their influ- ence with the people.\" There were no such folk among the Anglo-Saxons, although the written charms that remain show the tradition. Druidism is now recognized as being pre-Aryan,-\" part of that great magical system of thought which spread westwards from some eastern centre, possibly Babylonia.\" The Celts found druidism in Ireland when they arrived: presumably, therefore, the Tuatha De Danann represent a pre-Aryan people. An examination of druidical magic will show its difference from that of the Anglo-Saxons. Christianity, to a large extent, took over the magic of its predecessors, and the magical elements in the stories of the Christian saints do not differ very widely from the magical elements in the pagan myths. But in the contests which are told of between saint and druid, it is the druid who is usually worsted. An example of this occurs in the old Irish Passion of St. George. A magician named Ana- thais is summoned by the emperor to perform counter- magic to that of St. George. Anathais \" presented himself before the king, who said to him in great welcome, 'What means hast thou of driving out this man's magic art ?' Then Anathais in reply requested a bull to be brought to him, and when it was brought, he sang incantations in its ear, so that it burst into two fragments. So the king rejoiced at this and said : ' Of a truth thou can'st overturn 8 Social History of Ancient Ireland, vol. i, p. 228.

'Wait awhile,' said the magician ' and thou shalt see this wonder,' and he united again the pieces of the bull that had been burst asunder.\"9 With this may be compared the contest in magic, told of by LElfric, between Simon the magician and SS. Peter and Paul,xo and also Columba's conflict with Broichan, King Brude's wizard,-a Pictish druid.\"l The Christian church, however, was far from regarding the power of the druids as unreal.12 Similarly, JElfric represents the Emperor Decius,-though not a believer in Christianity,-as being much afraid of the drycrceft of St. Lawrence,-this word being used to denote the faith of the saint whereby he was able to endure the sufferings inflicted upon him by the emperor.13 It is on their malignant powers, naturally, that stress is mostly laid. An example of the infliction occurs in the story of the sick-bed of Cuculainn, where the women from the fairy hills struck him with little rods, which brought on an illness that nearly killed him.14 Is it possible that this should be equated with the Teutonic elf-shot ? The legends of the beginnings of druidism in Ireland seem to point to its having a foreign origin. \" The Tuatha D6 Danann,\" says the manuscript which describes the Second Battle of Moytura,15 \" were in the northern isles of the world, learning lore and magic and druidism and wizardry and cunning, until they surpassed the sages of the arts of heathendom.\" In a similar way the Esthonians 9 Passions and Homilies from Leabhar Breac, trans. by R.

Elsewhere Armorica is spoken of as the place where one of the Tuatha D' Danann learnt his craft.16 The following was the formula used of old in Orkney to .acquire the power of witchcraft:-\" Provided with five oval-shaped and two flat stones, the postulant went to the sea-shore at midnight, turning on his way three times against the course of the sun.\" On arrival he lay down on his back, with arms and legs stretched out, his head to the south, and taking care that the place was situated between high and low water marks. He then placed one oval stone at either foot, a flat stone on his chest, another over his heart, and grasped an oval stone in either hand. Shutting his eyes, he repeated a long incantation devoting himself to the evil spirit of the locality, and remained silent and motionless for a prescribed period. Then opening his eyes, he turned on his left side, rose, and flung the stones one by one into the sea with certain stereotyped forms of male- dictions and imprecations.\" 18 How exactly the druid accomplished his magic rites is difficult to learn; the result is given in many stories and occasionally the process. It is said of a sorcerer that he practised his spell \" on one foot, one hand [outstretched], and one eye [shut],\" and that he chanted in a low voice. (He was in a state of ecstasy at the time.) Thus did Lugh, \" as he went round the men of Erin,\" to hearten them before that second battle of Moytura.19 Possibly, the awkward position was supposed to increase the magic, and also to impress the spectators.

The making of a gldm dicinn or extempore curse against a king is described in the Book of Ballymote :-\" (There was) fasting on the land of the king for whom the poem had been composed .... The poet himself had to go in a company of seven.. . at sunrise, to a hilltop which should be on the boundary of seven lands . .. and the backs of them all (turned) towards a hawthorn which should be on the top of the hill, and the wind from the north.\" Thus they would sing \" each a stave. ...

This was called Teinm Laeghdha,22 or illumina- tion of rhymes. To accomplish this Finn chews his thumb, which he thus makes his sacrifice to his gods. It is magic inspiration which produces the name of the dead, after the recitation of a rhyme. The airbe druad,23 or druidical hedge, seems to have been a magical mist, produced to hide the druid's, and his friends', movements from observa- tion by the enemy. Possibly this only shows a utilization of the mists caused not by the druid himself but by the humid climate of Ireland.

The faeth-fiadha was a charm which rendered the user invisible. This was used by St. Patrick and his companions. It is the name given to St. Patrick's Lorica.27 The word bricht signifies a charm which causes sleep,\" (= Lat. carmen). The druid, like the Finnish shaman, could cause the soul to go forth from the body during sleep, and to visit distant lands.29 Bede relates in his Historia Ecclesiastica how St. Fursey came overfrom Ireland, and built himself a monastery at Crobheresburg in East Anglia. Here his soul, mindful of its Irish origin, \" quitting his body from evening till cock-crow,\" paid a visit to heaven.\" The druid, again like the Finnish magician, was said to be able to raise storms, and the same was the case with the Christian saints. Martin 31 speaks of a cross which was raised when rain was wanted and lowered when enough had fallen. The druid could also interpret omens and dreams, and declare auspi- cious and inauspicious times. Lucky days were fixed by scanning the sky. In the life of St. Columbcille is the 24 W.

When the prophet had scanned the sky, he said: 'Write an alphabet for him, now.' \" 32 An example of druidical divination occurs in the story of Ochy Airem and Etain; four yew rods are employed to find the fairy palace whither Midir had taken Etain. The druids were also accredited with the gift of prophecy. \" They prophesy,\" says Plummer, \"of Christ, and of Christian saints, foretelling their birth,33 their coming, their eminence, their place of burial.\" 34 It is by means of Frith Mhoire, or augury, that the Virgin discovered where Jesus was when he stayed behind in the Temple.35 Clairvoyance was practised by the druids, and known as \"enlightenment\"; by its aid they ascertained the will of the gods, and so prophesied.3a. It is probable, judging from the amount of initiation and education that the aspirant to druidism had to go through, that the druid was indeed the possessor of much knowledge ; and superior knowledge tends always to be considered by the ignorant to be of a magical nature. Many druidical accomplishments were also performed by Christian saints. For instance, the druidical hedge above mentioned could be produced by the saint by making the sign of the cross. The continuity of the practice of magic is not broken by the coming of Christianity. St. Columb- cille, in a prayer, uses the expression \" my druid, the Son of God,\" in speaking of Christ, since this would be under- stood more easily to show the powers he wished to ascribe to Him.36 32W.

Diancecht, the physician of the Tuatha D' Danann, obtained victory for his people against the Fomorians at the second battle of Moytura by placing \" one of every herb that grew in Erin \" in a well called Slane near the battlefield and singing spells over the well; into it all the mortally-wounded Tuatha D\" Danann were placed; from it they all came forth healed and ready once more to join in the battle.38 As is the case with Anglo-Saxon magic, the form in which many charms have been preserved is half-pagan and half- Christian, and many pagan practices have been recorded only by Christian writers. The following are enumerated by Whitley Stokes 39 as some of the superstitions which survived the introduction of Christianity :- \" I. The belief in elves, aes (or d6ine) side, descendants according to Irish tradition of the vanquished Tuatha De Danann. 2. The belief in magic. The heathen magician (drui, drai) is often mentioned in the Lives of the Saints.

He can summon demons to help him. He deals in deadly poisons.\" I add a number of instances of Christian magic, which are obviously survivals from a previous culture.

The narrative of the birth of St. Senin also contains a mixture of the pagan and the Christian. \" Now when the time came for the birth of that child, even Senin, his mother tarries alone in her garden, in autumn. An angel of God came to help her, so that the bringing forth of her son should not be difficult: and the angel blessed the child that was there born. The stake of rowan that was in her hand when she was bringing forth her son took the earth and burst at once into flower and leaf; and still that tree remains.\" 41 The story of the birth of Lugaid Red-stripe, given at the beginning of the life of St. Declan, is a gratuitous mention of a purely pagan episode.42 The pagan custom of fasting upon a person 43 in order to obtain a boon from him was still practised in Christian times. Thus Cormac the Red and his wife fast against the devil in order to obtain a child; Germanus fasts against Vortigern, and celestial vengeance falls upon the latter. 40 \"Vita Sancti Molaissi,\" Plummer, Vitae sanctorum Hiberniae, vol. ii, pp. 131-2. 41 W.

Whoever went to the secret well which was in the green of Nechtin's elf- mound, \" would not come from it without his two eyes bursting.\" B6and visited it to test this, \" and thrice she walked widdershins round the well. Whereupon three waves from the well break over her, and deprive her of a thigh and one of her hands and one of her eyes.\" She fled and was drowned at the mouth of the Boyne.56 Again, it is chronicled that the three triplet-sons of King Eochaid Feidlech \" marched through Ireland widdershins \" before they became the fathers of Lugaid Red-stripe.57 The ill- effects of Burd Ellen going round the church widdershins in the story of Childe Roland is too well known to call for more than passing mention.

Going right-hand before a battle in order to secure victory, for instance, was practised. \" Then Findchua marches in the van of that battalion, with ... his crozier in his hand, and he strength- ens the counsel and heartens the battalion, and comes right- handwise round the host, with his crozier in his hand.\" 58 Again, in the story of St. Senin, Raphael takes Senan to the island whence his resurrection,-and that of many other saints,-was to take place. They subdue the monster which guards it. \" Now after that,\" says the Life, \" Senin and the angels went right-handwise round the island till they came again to the Height of the Angels, after they had consecrated the island.\" 59 It is related in the Saltair-na-Rann that \" when the Hosts of the Seven Heavens used to gather round their King the animals used to come and adore Adam and then return right-hand- wise.\" 6o Although there are many parallels in individual charms, it may be seen from the foregoing examples that Celtic magical practices were of a very different nature to those found amongst the Anglo-Saxons. One learns, however, from the large number of penances attached to the practice of sorcery which occur in the Anglo-Saxon laws, both lay and ecclesiastical, that many heathen practices were still carried on, as indeed they were till the last witch was burnt a few centuries ago. One would judge that there were many individuals who performed black magic upon request. There are a great number of Anglo-Saxon words which denote magic and sorcery, with various slight variations of meaning. The only one, however, which shows any connection with the Celts is drf, drfcraft, which has been derived from drui. Presumably the reputation 58 W.

Whitley Stokes says that dry is a loan word from the Celtic, but gives no evidence to support his statement.61 dhr gives dr in both Anglo- Saxon and Celtic. There are no cognate words in other Teutonic languages. The first example in English of the word \" druid \" given by the New English Dictionary is of the year 1563, and it is derived from Latin, not old Celtic, sources. There are three Anglo-Saxon charms which contain words of corrupt Irish. These, despite modern research, are nearly as unintelligible to us as they were to the Anglo- Saxons who transcribed them. Dr. Henry Bradley, in an unpublished letter to Dr. Whitley Stokes, says \" some of the . . . charms contain sequences of Irish words of quite obvious meaning. For example the charm at III. p. 1062, ..\" in case a man or beast drink an insect,\" begins with the obviously appropriate words Gonomil orgomil marbumil,63 and at II. 54 there is a charm intended \" to stop blood,\" which contains the unmistakable words struth fola.\" 64 The rest of the charm runs :-\" +. cegryn thon struth fola argrenn tart struth ontria enn piath hathu morfana on hael 4 ara carn lew groth weorn ffil crondi w I x I mro cron cererio ermio aer leno.\" 65 Of this Prof. Gwynn says,- 61 \" Ags dry, magus, ist aus dem keltischen entlehnt,\" Urkeltischer Sprachschatz, (1894), p. 157. 62Cockfayne, Anglo-Saxon Leechdoms etc., (Rolls Series), vol. iii., Lacnunga 0o. 63 \" I wound the animal, I strike the animal, I kill the animal.\" See R. Thurneysen, Zeitschrift filr celtische Philologie, Bd. xiii, p. io6. The charm in full runs,--\" Gonomil orgomil marbumil marbsai ramum tofeitengo docuillo biran cuiScer caefmul scuiht cuillo scuiht cuib duill marbsiramum.\" Possibly some of my readers have some suggestions to make ? 64 These two words, Prof. E. J. Gwynn tells me, are not Irish as they stand, but suggest sruth fola, \" a stream of blood.\" 65 Leechbook, i. 9.

The other charm I have referred to is as follows :-\" For flying venom and every venomous swelling. . . sing... nine times this incantation.

Zimmer has many suggestions to make.67 The first three words may signify \"A charm against blood, against venom.\" hel signifies \" a spell,\" if equated with the Old Irish ele, a loan-word from Old Norse (Neill,=augurium, also a health-giving spell). raticamo helce-icas Xrita (not Xpita) haele may signify \" may my spell heal thee: let the spell heal, O Christ, who healeth.\" robarter slana (not plana) uili may signify \" all were healed.\" All is confused by the running on of words (through the ignorance of the Anglo- Saxon scribes), and the Latin terminations. Prof. Gwynn agrees with Zimmer's interpretation of a few of these words, such as ar-chro, \" against blood,\" ar reim, \" against poison,\" ra-t-ica mo, \" may heal thee-=my,\" icas, \" which heals.\" He also says,-\" The word tobcert naturally suggests the Irish dobert, \" put,\" which in the eighth century, or earlier, would be written tobert. If we read tara sz~ile for tera fueli we get tobert tara suiili, \" put upon his eyes.\" Xpita looks as if it contained the usual contraction Xr, \" Christ.\" This suggests that there may be an allusion 86 Leechbook, i. 45. 5. 87 H.

This again would involve reading, instead of icas Xpita hcele, something like icais Xr in dall dia snaele.
