The focus is on the magic aspect of ritual lamenta-tion, together with the analysis of the genres of laments within protective rites– although the texts used in such rites actually operate as charms and incanta-tion, the context of the custom reveals a number of elements which are intrinsicof the logic of presenting laments. The author comes to the conclusion, by way ofanalysing the texts performed at funerals and ward-off rites that besides thepoesy, uniform popular terminology and recitative presentation, these texts havesimilar performing characteristics and unitary magic. As an integrated whole,these characteristics make it possible to use the same terminology with regardto the texts used in protective magic rites and the ones of funeral customs.Key words: charms, funeral customs, Komi people, laments, warding-off ritesLamentations are categorised according to their function, i.e. funeral, wed-ding and soldier’s laments when being recruited. The ones performed outsidea certain ceremony are referred to as non-ritual laments, performed duringthe events of everyday life. The most archaic and the best known in manycultures are lamentations to the dead, folklorists presume that at first lamen-tations to the dead reminded of recitation/charming,/enchanting, whereas theone who performed them acted as a shaman escorting the souls (Psychopomp)(Honko 1978: 80–96; Nenola 1978: 77).According to Kirill Chistov’s theory, the genre of lamentations was trans-ferred to other rituals, associated with sending away and receipt, and devel-oped into an independent form that can exist outside rituals and can be per-formed according the relevant need, e.g. when reminiscing and mourning aclose person. Chistov refers to the northern part of Russia, and the habitats ofFinno-Ugric peoples, where the tradition of lamenting was particularly pro-nounced and where the above-mentioned hypothetical process can indeed beobserved (Chistov 2005: 189).A universal set of ritual lamentations has been recorded among the KomiZyrians, however, they also tend to have lamentations which are little known http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol47/misharina.pdf"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"156 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreGalina Misharinaby other peoples or not at all – these are the lamentations performed whenwarding off insects from the house, expelling weeds in the fields; during eco-nomic undertakings, e.g. when building a house, or when cultivating or process-ing cereals. For example, the Komi lamented prior to crossing a wide river;when ice was breaking up, and during major feasts, e.g. Radunitsa1 and Easter.This article focuses on two types of lamentations among the Komi: lamentsfor the dead and the ones preformed during warding-off rites (e.g. expellingbedbugs from the house and burdock from the fields).Lamenting at funerals is supposedly a familiar custom for the reader, how-ever, lamenting when warding off weeds and parasites created questions inthose who discovered this phenomenon several decades ago, and also amongthose who research Komi folklore today. Moreover, these rituals cast doubt ongenre-wise categorisation of lamentations. Indeed, it might be that in ward-offrites, it is not the lamentation at all, but instead, a charm – a genre used toprotect from and expel all kinds of sources of danger, including insects, predatorsand, among many cultures, even diseases or illnesses. The combination – magicand lamenting – is not very customary. In the current article I attempt tointroduce the use of laments in magic. Magic is concealed, it is not talkedabout loudly, and not practiced publicly; this is why it is not easy for research-ers to discover magic (Virtanen 1988: 239). The concealed magic component ofKomi lamentations for the dead is, in my view, revealed in their relation withthe recordings of warding-off rites. Upon the comparison of the texts of thelatter with lamentations, the categorisation of these texts and the use of la-ments in expelling parasites and weeds, seems logical.KOMI LAMENTATIONS FOR THE DEADA number of researchers have studied the funeral customs of the Komi (e.g.Nalimov 1907; Semenov 1992; Teriukov 1979, 1984; Limerov 1996). Up untiltoday, the lamentations of the Komi, however, have been the object of re-search on extremely infrequent occasions, differently from their other aspectsof oral tradition. When talking about burials, the informants, from among theKomi, underline that lamentations were performed repeatedly during the fu-neral: at home, on the way to the graveyard, in the graveyard until the coffinwas closed, and while the coffin was lowered into the grave, etc. In 1939, lamenterPlaton Kalisa presented the following lamentations to the collector, Ivan Osipov:When mother lies on the table (195 lines), Lament when carrying the coffin outand on its way to the grave (60 lines) and Lament on the grave (70 lines) (Osipov1986: 74–93). There are not many recordings of lamentations, used at different"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47157Funeral and Magical Rituals among the Komistages of ritual practices. Still, in the archive documents of the later period,lamentations have been marked by the performers or, more evidently, by thecollectors, according to the addressee, e.g., To mother, To husband, To father,etc. The article published by the renowned Komi collectors and researchers,Anatoli Mikushev and Fedor Plesovskii in 1979 can be considered to be theonly source material describing the lamentations from different Komi areas.The authors of the article provide the following description with regard toKomi burial laments: “(Burial) lamentations express the materialistic world-view, and are far from any kind of mysticism, “the world beyond” is not at allmystical. The images of the life beyond the grave are generally not reflected inlamentations and all details within lamentations are there for the main aimwhich is to express the endless grief of the family who has lost the breadwin-ner, a dear and beloved person” (Mikushev & Plesovskii 1979: 48). It might bethat materialism and the absence of mystics were indeed intrinsic in the So-viet folkloristics of the time, whereas during this era, when folkloristics wasoriented at philology and used the terms and notions of literary criticism,materialism was actually a characteristic of insufficient artistry and aestheti-cism. The fact that there were no descriptions of the passage to the beyond andafterlife, indicated that burial lamentations are not the core of archaic, mytho-logical cultural strata of the Komi.Yet the bearers of traditions did not evaluate the burial lamentations froman artistic perspective and, likewise, did not solely associate these with thepossibility to express one’s feelings, and attributed a magical power to thewailings. According to the 1979 report by Komi folklorists, the participants inthe expedition came across an astonishing phenomenon during the recordingof the burial lamentation – not that the Komi women had forgotten lamenting,quite the contrary – the lamentations were in active use and people believed intheir power. The lamenters categorically refused, as a response to the rel-evant request by the collectors, to perform the lamentation, or even fragmentsor retelling thereof, because they believed that performing the lamentationoutside a certain ritual practice would cause someone to die. One of the well-known lamenters in the neighbourhood, K. Turkova, dictated the text of theburial lamentation to her student grandchild (girl). Soon after this, anotherone of her grandchildren (a boy) was killed. The grandmother associated theslaughter with the fact that she had “performed” the burial lamentation out-side the ritual (KSC RA fund 5 inv. 2 f. 209a). The fact that lamenting outsidethe ritual is not safe is also evident in the procedure øîã ïûðêöäöì ‘shakingout the grief ’, which means that the clothes worn during lamenting were shakenand beaten afterwards (NMKR DF inv. 198; Plesovskii 1968: 123)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"158 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreGalina MisharinaTHE MAGIC OF LAMENTATIONSThe concept of magic is treated differently by researchers, for example, LauraStark, in her treatise determines magical as follows: “supernatural means tocause harm to others, to protect someone from supernatural damage, the spell-ing of charms and healing from illnesses” (Stark 2006: 45). Elena Levkievskaiamakes a distinction between three forms of magic in charms: tangible,actualisational and verbal (Levkievskaia 2002: 334). Word magic is usually as-sociated with charms, the words of which are believed to be “a weighty meansto achieve a certain goal; [---] a medium that cannot be opposed by natural lawsor the will of an individual” (Poznanskii 1917: 102).Jouko Hautala, a Finnish folklorist, has expressed his opinion that the ex-istence of any kind of poesy is conditioned by magical factors and the entireprimordial poesy can be conditionally referred to as charms (Hautala 1960: 40).When discussing the (magic) power of the word, the researcher Hautala turnsto the genre of lamentations. He writes that the magic of wedding lamenta-tions lies in protecting the bride from the danger that primarily proceeds fromthe deceased of her family, whereas the burial lamentations soften and erasethe deceased’s doubt as if the living ones could be blamed for his/her death.The researcher is also of the opinion the expression of mourning and grief ismagical in nature, as when the dead person hears being mourned, the deadperson would not be hostile against the living ones (Hautala 1960: 39).Folklorists Valeriia Eremina and Kirill Chistov have specified the connec-tions between Russian burial lamentations and magic. According to V. Eremina,charms are being intertwined in Russian lamentations; K. Chistov underlinesthe magic function of burial lamentations (Eremina 1981: 70–86; Chistov 1994:267–274). Both researchers reach their conclusions on the basis of the motifs,existent in lamentations, where the lamenters ask, in an imperative form, thecoffin cover to open and the deceased person to rise. According to K. Chistov,the magical function of these motifs transformed into an emotional rhetoricmethod as early as during the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20thcentury (Chistov 1994: 273).The universal all-embracing term magic (magical) attains concreteness whenplaced in the frames of performative utterances, language, as presented byJohn Austin, the analytical philosopher in this book How to Do Things withWords (Austin 1986). When contemplating the diversity of language use, Austincame to a conclusion that there are a number of utterances that are not merelysaid, but are also used to do something (Austin 2006: 264). He suggested suchutterances be referred to as performative, without describing the exact possi-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47159Funeral and Magical Rituals among the Komibility to make a distinction between constative and performative utterances.Austin also presented utterances as three-level compounds wherein locutionary,illocutionary and perlocutionary acts take place. Later on, his idea was used indeveloping the speech act theory (mainly in the case of the illocutionary actwhich adheres to a certain force which is revealed in speaking) (Austin 1986:100; Searle 1986: 151–1969). The subject matter for the speech act theory waseveryday speech, and naturally, magic was not borne in mind while referringto the power of words.Activity-based aspect of language has been studied for a long time in thecase of anthropology of linguistics and folkloristics. The researchers have re-peatedly noted that folkloristic performances do not merely describe but alsoconfirm, organise, create and transform the world (Siikala 1994: 68; Piela 1988;Adon’eva 2004). Performativity is also one of the key words in Lotte Tarkka’smonograph Rajarahvaan laulu. Tarkka observed the Karelian folk songs of theWhite Sea as a speech act “used as a mediation to speak about the surroundingworld and attempting to influence this” (Tarkka 2005: 11). Word magic, thepower of words equals with activity, this was earlier mentioned by a number offolklorists in connection with charms and this is a conspicuous example of theperformativity of folkloric language. Nevertheless, it is not only the charmsthat can be treated as performative. Tarkka is of the opinion that a specificway of performing is intrinsic to any genre, not only to a ritual one (Tarkka2005: 386).SPECIFIC USE OF WORDS AT LIMINAL TIMESBurial lamentations of the Komi, and also of other peoples, are a particularform of communicating with the dead. First, the lamenters make abundantaddresses to and ask rhetoric questions from the deceased. When addressingthe dead, the lamenters use specific expressions such as âöð ïó éûëûñü ëýäçû-ñüöé, âà ïûäöñûñü ëýïòûñüöé, øîíäiáàíöé ÷öñêûä éöëà ìàòóøêàöé, ‘descend-ing/bringing down from the tops of my trees my sun-faced and sweet-milkmother’ etc., conveying an exclusively positive and respectful attitude, theveneration of the living towards the dead. The appearance related featuresand social status of the deceased is comprehensively praised and lauded whenaddressing them in lamentations. K. Chistov has said about the addresses inRussian lamentations, that the paraphrased names used to refer to the de-ceased, the bride and bridegroom, are connected with the “prohibitions to pro-tect the lamenter and other members of the family from the further impact ofevil powers, the first manifestation of which had been the death of the person"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"160 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreGalina Misharinawho is being grieved for” (Chistov 1960: 13). An entire system of paraphrasedmetaphors to be used for kinship relationships has been worked out in Karelianlamentations. The researchers of these lamentations support K. Chistov’s opin-ion that it is a taboo to mention the actual name of the person (Stepanova2004: 7). Though, according to Unelma Konkka, the taboos had lost their poweryet the metaphors had obtained a poetic meaning in the language of lamenta-tions (Konkka 1975: 170–180). The traditional motif in Komi burial lamenta-tions is the grief of departure, whereas in the archived Komi lamentations,there are no verbal markers referring to communication with the dead ances-tors, no motifs of passing on greetings to the dead relatives, all of which areintrinsic of the lamenting tradition of Northern Russia, Karelian and Ingrianareas (see, e.g., Konkka 1992: 117–119).Yet in connection with the magical power and performativity of lamenta-tion, I would like to draw attention to funeral lamentations which at first glanceare the most neutral ones and evidently reflect this materialism that earliercaught the eye of the researchers of Komi folklore. These mentioned motifs asif describe and state as to what is going on in the ritual. In these utterances,the speaker uses reflexive pronouns “I” and “we”, however, there is no dataindicating to the fact as if the lamentation was performed by many women at atime. In this case the pronoun “we” would tell that the lamenter, instead oftalking solely on behalf of herself, actually does this in the name of otherparticipants in the ritual. The predicate of these utterances characterises theactivities that the “I” is performing at the moment or intending to do so. Oneverb can be repeated and form an entire section in the lamentation.One of the most typical stating utterances is ìå ìöäöäà ‘I send’. Indeed,there is a difference when comparing this with the rhetoric question, intrinsicof lamentations, where do you go, where are you going, where are you prepar-ing yourself for, etc. In the latter, the utterance is formed in the way as if thedeceased would go to the world beyond in his/her own free will. The words “Isend you/we send you”, the performers depict the sending as if initiated by theliving. These two utterances can be observed as evidence of an ambiguousattitude towards the deceased. On the one hand, the cult of ancestors and fearof the dead gives rise to utterances according to which the dead person wouldget him/herself dressed and prepares for the journey, and leaves him/herself,etc. He/She is the one going on a journey, and the participants perform as theones passively sending him/her away. Yet on the other hand, with an aim torestore order in the world, the living ones need to act themselves, and bydoing so they transform the ritual action of the deceased into a passive object.In lamentation the deceased are sent from this world to the world beyond.The characteristic features of this world are revealed by way of the following"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47161Funeral and Magical Rituals among the Komiconcepts: light, will, white, free, warm. The world of the living may be denotedin lamentations by way of the expressions such as âöëüíöé ñâåò ‘the freeworld’, âöëüíöé âöëÿ ‘freedom, free will’. In lamentations, the notions of theworlds are often of deictic character, thus, the world of the living can be de-noted in burial lamentations as òàëàäîð ñüâåò, òàéö ìó ‘the world of this side,this land’, and when referring to being in this world, the phrase òàòöí ‘here’ isused. To depict the world beyond, opposition of deictic terms is used: this –that, here – there, from here – to there. For example, it says, in a lamentationmourning the dead mother: ñýò÷ö âöä òýöé ìóíàí äà ‘there you go, yes’(Osipov 1986: 75). In fact, deictic signifiers do not have a specific content andinstead, this is determined by the circumstances of the spoken act message.There, as an opposite of here, denotes any place farther away from here. Themetaphors, used in lamentations to denote the world beyond, are expressionswherein the word indicating a location is formed with the suffix -òöì. Thisgrammatical form of the nouns in the Komi language refers to the absence ofsomething, giving the meaning of imperfection of an action, or lack of knowl-edge – that the activity was not completed. The place where the deceased aresent away in lamentations is marked by expressions such as ïåëüöí êûâëûòöìèí‘the place the ears have not heard of ’, ñèíìöí àäçûâòöìèí ‘the place eyes havenot seen’, òóé äæåíüäûòöìèí ‘the place where the road is not becoming shorter’,òóé îòòöìñüûòöìèí ‘the place where the way does not become narrower’.These metaphors are not unambiguous, and obtain different meanings whencommunicating with the deceased. The expression ïåëüöí êûâëûòöìèíö si-multaneously acquires the meaning “send to the place of which my ears andyour ears have not heard of ”, and also “the place where you and I would nothear about each other, from where the sounds would not be heard in “here””.What it means is that the dead person is sent to a place out of the reach ofauditory and visual senses. The living can send the dead to a long and wideroad that leads to eternity where “the road does not shorten and the road doesnot become narrower” and from where there is no way back or further. Thisidea is realised in the following formulaic motif:Êóçü òóé ìå ìöäöäà äæåíüäûòýìèíý.Îòà òóé ìå ìöäöäà îòòöìñüûòöìèíý.I send you to a long road where the path would not become shorter.To a wide road I send you where the path would not become narrower.Traditionally, this given motif would proceed as follows:Âîäçå ìå ìöäýäà ìóíòýìèíý íèí,Áöðå ìå ìöäýäà êîñòýìèíý íèí!"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"162 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreGalina MisharinaFarther I send you from where there is no way on,Back I send you from where there is no return.(Mikushev et al. 1994: 75, No. 18, 76, 18b)In general, love is being expressed towards the deceased in all possible waysand in the unwillingness to depart; even reproaching the deceased for leavingthe others behind. However, in the given example, the lamenter explicitlywords her thought: she sends the deceased person to the way in order that he/she would not return. Such formulae can also be noted in the lamentations ofthe Izhma-Komi. Maybe, it is the reversed prosody of the verse, intrinsic ofIzhma-Komi lamentations that makes it possible to convey this idea, particu-larly in the tradition of the given area, the word at the beginning of the utter-ance would match together with the last word in the phrase. Lamenters say“back I send” but they actually bear in mind “I send to there from where is noreturn”. As a result of such an intentionally “wrong” word order in the utter-ance, the direct idea is encoded in the composition of the line of verse.Besides the utterances “I send you” there are also motifs, intrinsic of buriallamentations, conveying the idea of relocation and of placing the deceasedsomewhere. In these motifs, the focus is on the verbs put, place, followed by aword denoting the situation. For example, in lamentations, the “I” says thatshe puts or places “him/her” under a thick layer of soil, “under the twelvelayers of ground”. In burial lamentations from Udora, it says:Ìóûñëû äà ìó ïûäöñàñ ïóêòàìå,Âàûñëû äà âà ïûäöñàñ ïóêòàìå,À ïóûñëû äà ïó ñüöìöñàñ ïóêòàìå /Into the earth, underneath the ground we place,Into the water, underneath the water we place,Into the tree, in the heart of the tree we place /(KSC RA fund 1, inv. 11, r. 291)As the world of the living is on the surface of ground, earth and water, theplacing of the dead under the soil and water can indeed be understood as maxi-mum removal from the world of the living. In the above fragment, the expres-sion “into the tree, in the heart of the tree we place” can be interpreted as ametaphor for putting the dead in the coffin, as when making a coffin, the coreof the tree was carved out (Belitser 1958: 147). Besides the fact that the placesto where the deceased are sent or placed, these locations are also visuallyunreachable and soundproof, as far as possible from the world of the living, thelamentations also contain the ideas of creating obstacles, e.g. utterances re-garding a high mountain with a stone wall, and closing the destination where"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47163Funeral and Magical Rituals among the Komithe deceased had gone, with, e.g. “a wooden and German lock” (Mikushev et al.1995: 170, 173). In Russian and Karelian lamentations, it is customary to referto the grave as a new dwelling, whereas in Komi lamentations, the grave isalso denoted with the metaphor of being a house, and, in addition, as a lockedplace (Stepanova 2004: 91; Rakhimova 2005: 109–119).Descending into the grave and putting the dead in the coffin can be con-veyed with a metaphor of a dark monastery, which, in my opinion, originatesfrom the association of being imprisoned in a monastery.Ñûðà íèí ïóêòà äà ìàòþðàý,Êâàéòý íèí ïóêòà äà ïöëûñ êîñìå,Äæóäæûä íèí ïåìûä äà ìàíàñòûðå,Óóñÿíü íèí áóêñýí äà áóêøàéòàíiíý,Âûûñÿíü íèí òøàêåí òøàêñÿéòàíiíý.In the moist soil I put you,Between the six boards,In a deep and dark monastery,A place already moulding from underneath,A place covered with fungi on top.(Mikushev et al. 1994: 75)CHARMS AND LAMENTATIONS IN WARDING-OFF RITESIn 1960, the collectors of Komi folklore in Mutnyi Materik village, Komi Re-public, came across the so far unknown singing performances, described lateras the “forgotten genre of folklore”. These texts, pursuant to the observationsof the collectors, reminded of lamentations, considering their musical and po-etical characteristics, and the terminology used by the bearers of tradition.However, when attempting to ascertain the context of performing these texts,the researchers needed to contemplate as these lamentations were performed,in the words of the informants, when expelling bedbugs from the house andwarding off burdock from the fields (Mikushev et al. 1994: 11).The tradition of expelling insects was known long before the “discovery” ofthese texts. A. Sidorov, a Komi researcher, referred to the warding off of bed-bugs and cockroaches as magical rituals and published the description thereofin his monograph Charms, witchcraft and evil eye of the Komi people (Çíà-õàðñòâî, êîëäîâñòâî è ïîð÷à ó íàðîäà êîìè), first published in 1928 (Sidorov1997: 28).

The process to eliminate burdock from the fields wasas follows: êóèì öêìûñà ‘three times nine’ burdocks were pulled out with roots,tied together, and then one group of women would take the burdock to theriver, walking backwards, and the others would beat the burdock with whips(KSC RA fund 1, inv. 11, r. 206). According to another story, the largest burdockwas pulled out in the field and thereafter planted on the road (KSC RA fund 11,inv. 11, r. 186). At darkness, the burdock could also be cut with a fire poker(SyktSU FA 1573-34). There were several methods to get rid of bedbugs: puton a woodchip, the bedbugs were let go downstream the river (Sidorov 1997:81–82); a bundle of bedbugs was put inside the birch-bark shoe and then takento the crossing of three roads (e.g. SyktSU FA RF 12-XVI–40); bedbugs were“buried” in the graveyard (SyktSU FA 1911-32, 34)In general, such “bewitching” seems to be quite appropriate to use charmstherein, however, the texts that were read during the ritual practices (thenarrators bear in mind the charms) or asked (here the narrators bear in minddialogue-charms) are actually the most typical lamentations to bedbugs andburdock. To illustrate the tradition and the relevant lamentations, I wouldhereby present the material recorded (written down in 1991, from the inhabit-ants of the Kozhva village, Pechorskii district, Komi Republic.

To address the bedbug and burdock, theperformers use periphrases, which, in their structure and formation, are simi-lar to the addresses used in burial lamentations. As a comparison: bedbug –÷öñêûä âèðåñ þèñü ‘the one who drinks tasty blood’, mother – ÷öñêûä éöëöíâåðäûñü ‘the one who feeds with tasty milk’. When using the words ludik ‘bed-bug’ and jön ‘burdock’, these are always accompanied with epithets of positivecolouring, e.g. šondibanöj ludiköj ‘my Sun-faced bedbug’. Frequently, thelamenters commence their performance with indeed such addresses (highlightedin bold):Øîíäiáàíöé äàé ëóäiêöé,×öñêûä óí ïàëåäûñåé äàé.Ïåðâîé ãàæåäûñåé.×öñêûä âèðåñ þûñåé äàé,Êîð íö ìå òýíý ñýññÿ àääçûëà,Çýâ æå íèí òý æàëü äà,Êîð íèí ýñÿ ìå òýíý àääçûëà,Íåêîð öä îã ìå àääçûë.Ìàåã éûëý, îé, òý êàéèíÄà-é êûíìàí.You my Sun-faced bedbug,You who wakes me in my sweet sleep,My first entertainer.The one who drinks my tasty blood, yes,When shall I see you again,I feel so sorry for you, yes,When shall I see you again,Never again shall I see you now,Oh, you climb up on a stakeAnd freeze to death.(KSC RA fund 5, inv. 11 r. 172) (103)In order to add more respect to the utterance, bedbug and burdock can becalled after their first name and father’s name Ëóäûê Ëóäûêîâè÷ (Ludyk Ludy-kovich) ‘Bedbug, son of Bedbug’, Òîòàðèí Òîòàðèíîâè÷ (Totarin Totarinovich)‘Tatar, son of Tatar’. By the way, it is not at all accidental that the word òàòàðèí(tatarin) ‘Tatar’ is used as an epithet or metaphor for burdock. In weddinglamentations of the Komi, Tatarians are considered to be the kinship of thebridegroom, and until a certain moment in the wedding, they are foreign anddangerous for the bride, i.e. the ones coming from the other world.The specific feature converging these texts to these of lamentations is agroup of verbal expressions providing the speech with a tint of grieving. Griefabout departure may be expressed in rhetoric questions to bedbug and bur-dock: how shall I live from now on, who will now wake me up early, when shallwe meet again, etc. Likewise, the performers may be compassionate abouttheir future, e.g., being afraid they might die of cold and hunger. They can ask"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"166 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreGalina Misharinaforgiveness from bedbug and burdock, from their “brothers-sisters and theentire family”. It is also characteristic of the ward-off texts to use phrases withwhich the performer of the rite as if comments or describes the stages of theritual. For example, “I” or “we” tell the bedbug that they will now wrap it in arag and take it to the crossing of three roads, put it in a bag and take it away,send or intend to send it on the way and put it in the ground. The ward-offutterances, stating the ritual, again remind of burial lamentations where it istold that the deceased is sent away from home, sent on the way, put in thecoffin, placed in the soil, etc.These utterances of ward-off rituals may be presented as integral com-positional blocks. The following example introduces the phrases said by thecharmer to go with the main elements of the ritual: the start to sending off thebedbug, bedbugs are collected in a box, three times nine bedbugs, they aresent to the earth, sent forever, buried, in order for them not to come out, inorder for them not to come back, not to return in the future.Ýæòûð ëóä ëóäûêåñ ìöäàì ìöäýäíû áóð ðöäâóæúÿñíàñíóì,Ýæòûð ëóä ëóäûêåñ ìöäàì ìöäýäíû áóð âîê-÷îéíàñíóì,Êóèì öêìûñ òiÿíòý êó÷àì ÷óêàðòíû êöðåáûñ ïûòøêå,Ñýññÿ íèí òiÿíòý êó÷àì ñûðà çåìëÿ íóýäíû ìàòþðà ïûòøêå,Êàðòûð ðöäâóæúåí òi ïîìëàñüíûä ìöäàì óêåðåíèòíû áóð ðöäâóæúÿñëû,Ýæòûð Ëóä Ëóäûêåñ ìöäàì íóýäíû òi ïîìíûä áóð âîê-÷îéíàñíóì.Àñ îëûã ñýññÿ ìè ìöäýäiì âåêûñ êåæå,Âîäçå íèí Ëóäiêåñ ñýññÿ ìè ñý÷÷å ïóêòiì âîòýì âûëý,Áöðå íèí Ëóäiêåñ ñýññÿ ìè ïóêòiì êîñòýì âûëý,Ñûðà çåìëÿ ìè ïóêòiì ïåòòýì âûëý...We intend to send the bug, the bedbug on the journey, sheets full of goodfamily,We intend to send bug the bedbug on the journey, sheets full of goodbrothers and sisters,Three times nine we collect you in a box,Then we start sending you to the bosom of mother earth2,Because of you we uproot a nest full of good family,Because of you we take the bug the bedbug sheets full of good siblings.We sent then for the lifetime, forever,There we put the bedbug, in order for it not to return,Then we put the bedbug in order for it not to come back,Into the soil (=grave) we put, in order for it not to come out...(KSC RA fund 1 inv. 11 r. 206)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47167Funeral and Magical Rituals among the KomiThe widely spread opinion with regard to lamentations, i.e. these being prima-rily associated with tragic circumstances and the expression of grief for thepassing away of the close ones, did not allow the researchers to associate lam-entations with warding-off rituals (Alekseevskii 2007: 267–269). The texts, ex-pressing benevolence towards the vermin, were preformed in a mournful man-ner, with simultaneous crying, and the entire ritual seemed to be in every waycontradictory to the main aim of this tradition – to ward off vermin and protectthe people and their wellbeing. Likewise, the connection between lamentationand warding-off rites has not been observed in the system of Russian folkloregenres, on which the folklorists relied. The context of the performance, themagical number of bedbugs and burdock (three times nine) in the rituals, notedby Anatolii Mikushev, the laudatory, pleasing tone of the addresses and apolo-gies to the objects of being expelled, made the researchers think that the textsoperate in this ritual as charms and conjuring. Functional approach and anattempt to include popular folk names and presenting these in the songs gaverise to the following key words with regard to this text group: charm-songs,songcharms, lamentation-charms, charm improvisations, songcharms of agrar-ian cycle (e.g. Konakov 1993; Mikushev 1973, Filippova 1996).However, pleading, threatening, disparaging and commanding formula, in-trinsic of bewitching ones, are not to be found in these texts. It became obviousthat the texts belonging within warding-off rituals are actually converging withlamentations, both with regard to their style, poetic specificity, manner of per-forming and musical characteristics. Likewise, the informants also confirmedthat the performing of the texts in warding-off rituals is actually lamenting.Communication with the addressees of the text – bedbugs and burdock – isanalogous to lamentations sending off the deceased: it is customary to onlytalk good about the deceased, and ask him/her for forgiveness, it is obligatoryto show the deceased, by way of benevolent verbal and physical form, that he/she is being mourned.The elements, within the logic of performing lamentations, can also benoticed within the context of the ritual with vermin – one of them being thefact that terminologically, the warding-off rite, particularly in case of bedbugs,was referred to as sending away and funerals (ludik gualöm, lidik dzeböm),and, based on the narratives, this burial was actually conducted as a real-lifeactivity. The insects and weed are not destroyed during the ritual, instead,they are “sent” from one space to another. The places, where the bedbug orburdock actually are in the course of the ritual, are associated in the Komiculture with the world beyond or with the way leading to the other world,being liminal areas, the mediators between the two worlds. Within the expel-ling rites, bedbugs end up in the river, crossing of three roads, be tied to the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"168 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreGalina Misharinacart of a beggar; burdock can occur in the river or be planted on the road. Thetradition encompassed a number of activities and artefacts with protective prop-erties. For instance, when expelling bedbugs, it is necessary to ride on a firepoker, making three circles around the house. In many rituals, drawing acircle is a method to create a closed space, which cannot be penetrated by thesources of danger (Levkievskaia 2003). Reverse activities have been recordedin “taking out” the burdock, e.g. the lamenters, when holding the plant, movedbackwards. In this, Anatolii Mikushev has noticed a parallel with the burialcustoms of the Nenets, neighbours of the Komi, where, in order to protectoneself from the hostile power, and blur the traces, people walk backwards(Mikushev 1973: 38). Likewise, funeral customs of the Komi also entail a wholecomplex of reversed actions – committed to protect oneself from any influencepossibly coming from the deceased –, e.g., turning around or inverting objectsand artefacts, plaiting a reversal braid, moving counter-clockwise around afresh grave, prohibition to look back when leaving the graveyard, etc. Con-cerning the items used in the ritual, I would like to highlight the fire poker.I am of the opinion that the poker is involved in both of the above-describedrituals in order to protect the person performing these ritual activities, at themoment of encounter with the world beyond. The protective power of the ironpoker is indeed confirmed in a traditional children’s game where the housespirit, invited from the cellar during the play, was scared off and sent back toits location with the help of the poker (Nesanelis 1993: 96–98).Still, what remains disputable, genre-wise, are the motifs of warding-offtexts where the performer, on behalf of herself, talks about what she is doing.Such utterances are extremely intrinsic in the case of charms (e.g. Viljakainen2009, Piela 2005). Bearing in mind the fact that these texts are performedduring the warding-off ritual, the words said to bedbugs and burdocks are self-evidently associated with charms.Nevertheless, according to reference literature, similar motifs are alsopresent in the burial lamentations of the Komi, and not only there. TatianaBunchuk, a linguist, had defined “syntactic constructions, with the predicatein the central position” in Komi wedding lamentations, work songs and otherlamentations. She is of the opinion that the relevant Komi texts are similar tothe vita herbae / rei texts, used in Slavic culture as an apotropaic magicalagent, or the one with productive character. Bunchuk refers to the vita herbae/ rei texts as the ones contributing to restoring the balance of world order,when the representatives of the world beyond have disturbed or are threaten-ing the order of the world, during the liminal stages of human life (Bunchuk2006: 113–126)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47Folklore 47169Funeral and Magical Rituals among the KomiUlla Piela talks about healing narratives (parantavia narratiiveja), whenreferring to the text groups in Finnish-Karelian charms narrating of the ritualwherein the healer tietäjä talks about his activities and wishes within the charmtext (Piela 2005: 13). Proceeding from the above, the utterances in the style of“I do something” in warding-off rites function as performative narratives thatsend away the bedbug and burdock and create a world without vermin. Simi-larly, the performer, who is authorised to represent the interests of the entiregroup, creates performance narratives, by way of imitating and doubling his/her actions with words. The interpretations of the metaphors denoting thelocus to where the deceased are sent or placed make it possible to concludethat performativity, the magic of burial lamentations is all about the capabilityof the lamenter to place the deceased in the place where it is not possible tomake oneself heard or visible, from where there is no way back or forth, and toclose this place. Thus, the texts performed at funerals and warding-off ritualshave similar performativity, in addition to the recitative nature, poesy andcommon folk-related terminology; in other words, they have a uniform magi-cal foundation. As a whole, these characteristics make it possible to use thesame terminology in the case of texts utilised at expelling rituals, and the onesperformed in funeral tradition.The given interpretation does not pretend to be an exhaustive characteri-sation of lamentation magic. Performative interpretation thereof provided anopportunity to see the so far unknown facets of burial lamentations and moulda standpoint with regard to the genre of warding-off rites, and to partiallyunderstand the logic of lamenting in expelling rituals.NOTES1 Radunitsa [ðàäóíèöà] – a pagan spring feast associated with the cult of ancestorsamong the Eastern Slavs. After conversion to Christianity, this feast was celebratedon the first Sunday after Easter, or on the following Monday or Tuesday.
