Who are thevariouspeopleswhosegeographyand religiousheritageare designatedbythese terms?Whatmethodsand conceptsare to be used in examiningtheir religions?TheAustronesiansThe word ‘Austronesian’was coinedfrom the Latinaustralis,‘southern’,and the Greeknesos,‘island’.It designates afamily of languagesspokeninalarge numberof islands,from Taiwan to Madagascarand NewZealand.Thus the term is primarilylinguistic: one must avoidimaginingthat it correspondsto any biologicalor geneticunity. On the other hand,there is archaeologicalevidencefor the spreadof Austronesian-speakingpeoplesin prehistory:theremust have been an original,proto-Austronesianpopulation,with ahomeland.It is now generallybelievedthat that homeland was Taiwan. Somearchaeologistshave arguedthat it"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"was in the islandsof South-EastAsia, but other archaeologistshavecounter-argued convincingly that the proto-Austronesians must havelived in Taiwanafter comingfrom south-eastern Chinaand beforesubsequent migrations.Linguistsare agreedthat the homeland must havebeen Taiwan,as the area of the greatestlinguisticdiversity.Whenwouldthe proto-Austronesianshave reachedTaiwan?Theirjourneyingsmusthave been precededby the revolutionsof the‘Neolithic’period,the last part of the StoneAge. In this period,afterthat of huntingand gatheringfood,plantsand animalsweredomesticated. Thus in Chinathe domestication of rice and millethappenedby around6000BCE.Byaround5000BCE,onChina’s easternseaboard,wefind archaeologicalevidenceof this Neolithicculture:pottery,agricultural tools and the bones of domesticated chickens, dogsand pigs. Similarevidenceis foundin Taiwanfor the periodfromaround4000 to 3000BCE.1After the proto-Austronesianshad settledin Taiwanthere wouldhavebeen, beforefurthermigrations,a‘long pause’,accordingto the Hawaii-basedlinguistRobert Blust,whosereconstructions have been widelyfollowed.Blust originallyarguedthat Taiwanwas the home of the fourmain trunksof the Austronesianlanguage family,three of whichstayedbehindwhilethe fourthmigratedand fannedout. Later,after furtherresearch,he decidedthat the languagefamilyhad ten main trunks,nineof whichremainedin Taiwanwhilethe tenth,called‘Malayo-Polynesian’, split offand movedfirst to the northernPhilippinesandthen elsewhere.Later,Malayo-Polynesian wouldhave dividedinto‘WesternMalayo-Polynesian’and ‘Central-EasternMalayo-Polynesian’.Then the latter wouldhave split into‘CentralMalayo-Polynesian’on theone hand and ‘EasternMalayo-Polynesian’on the other.2Accordingto Blust the proto-Austronesianson Taiwanwouldhaveencountered arichvariety of plantsand animals there. They wouldhavecultivatedrice,millet, taro and sugarcane,and had pigs and dogs.Thelatter wouldhave been used in hunting,whichwas done with bows andspring-settraps, while baskettraps were used for catchingfish. Fish andmeat wouldhave been smoked.Blust reconstructsproto-Austronesianwordsfor ‘headhunting’(\u001ckayaw)and ‘war trophy’(\u001ctaban,whichmeans‘head trophy’in some Taiwaneselanguages).(An asterixdenotesareconstructedform.)He observes: ‘As in otherparts of the world,headhunting was inextricablytied up with religiousideas, in particular2ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"notionsof humanand agricultural fertilityresultingfrom the captureand ritual incorporation of souls or spiritualforce from outsidethecommunity.’3(Tattooing,whichwas also practised,may have beenassociatedwith headhunting.)But there are no words for ‘war’ or ‘battle’:fightingseemsto have been of aguerrillakind, for revengeor booty.There was loom weaving, along with the plaitingof mats, whilepersonaladornmentinvolved beads and jade. Abamboonose flute was played,and the Jew’s harp (or mouthharp) was probablyused in courtship. Theproto-Austronesiansevidentlyburied their dead, and appearto have hadaword for ‘ghost’(\u001cqanicu).4Blust has also reconstructedanumberof elementsof proto-Malayo-Polynesianculture,from the time after the proto-Malayo-Polynesianssplit away from the otherAustronesianspeakersin Taiwan beforemigratingto the northernPhilippinesand until their own division intosub-families. The breadfruitand the coconutwere important,and sagowas known.Food was cookedin apot, restingon atrivet or three stones,or alternativelywas roastedover afire or bakedin an earth oven. Goldwas also known.There was aconceptof ‘inhabitedterritory’(\u001cbanua), asopposedto the wilderness,and there was a‘publicbuilding’(\u001cbalay),probablyamen’s house.Housesin generalweresubstantialtimberones,raised on piles and enteredby aladder.Pigs’ jaws were probablyhung upin them,the pigs havingbeen killed in ahunt or at afeast. The term\u001chamuk,which has gone intothe Englishexpression‘to run amuck’,isseen by Blust as referringto ‘a violentlyantisocial psychologicalstatewhichmay or may not have had connectionswith warfare.’5In additionto the proto-Austronesianconceptof the ghost or spirit of the dead(\u001cqanicu)the proto-Malayo-Polynesianshad the ideas of a‘breath-soul’(\u001cnawa)and a‘life-force’or ‘spirit’(\u001csumanged), as in the ‘spirit of therice’ in the islandsof South-EastAsia.6Theseproto-Malayo-Polynesianswouldprobablyhavespreadthroughoutthe Philippines.The Austronesianlanguagesspokentherebelongto the WesternMalayo-Polynesiansub-family.Otherspeakersofthis sub-familymigratedto Borneo,Sumatra,Java and parts of mainlandSouth-EastAsia. Some migratedfrom Borneoto Madagascar, probablyaround700CE.T he other main sub-family,the Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesians, probablymovedfrom the Philippinesto northernSulawesi.Theythen split up.

Lots of terms havebeen reconstructedfor canoe parts and coconutculture.8Canoeswere all-important in these migrations.Around2000BCEtheAustronesianspeakersmust have adoptedatriangularsail, pushedup byatilting pole, and the ‘outrigger’,awoodenattachmentthat floatsparallelto the canoe to increasestability.Later, by around500BCE,theyhad the ‘double canoe’,whichcould carry families, animalsand plantsfor colonization. Oceanicspeakersnavigated by the stars and the sun, the‘swells’of the sea, ‘dead reckoning’estimatesof the canoe’sprogress,cloudscoveringmountainislandsand birds flying out from islandstofish.

They are characterizedby clan systemsand apreference for marriagebetween‘cross-cousins’, the childrenof abrotherand sister. In their marriagesystemsthey restrictthis in specificways: thus, for example,there is often preferencefor marriagebetweenaman and his mother’sbrother’s daughter, while he is not allowedtomarryhis father’ssister’sdaughter.The peoplesof the islandof Sumbaattributemuchsignificance tolivestock,as havingto be obtainedand preserved.Abundanceof livestockis seen as ‘cool’,somethingfor whichoneprays when addressingspirits.One’spossessionsare intimatelyconnectedwith one’s life or ‘vitality’.This is reflectedin the custom of callingan importantman by the nameof his horse.Thus one slaughterslots of water buffalo at aburial feast,givingthis wealthto the ancestors so that they will give one wealthinreturn.Waterbuffalo also figure in annualrituals,when the rains start tofall: the Sumbanesepray that the buffalo may not be injuredwhentreadingthe rice fields and, later, when they are broughtback from thefields, more rites are performed to ‘cool’ them after the heat producedbytramplingthe earth.An animalmust be slaughteredwith respect,andnever by its owner.20On the islandof Flores,in its easternpart, we shall encounterthe‘Peopleof the ForestLand’ (Ata Tana ‘Ai), who live betweenmountainridges,isolatedfrom other peoplesand thus preservingan extremelyarchaicreligion.Every 15 to 20 years they hold their most importantINTRODUCTION9"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ceremony,toensure the fertilityof their land.

Whenthe condition of the house deterioratesand it hasto be rebuiltahole is dug in its foundationsand the body is buriedin it,standingup. Zhengcomments that this is in effect ‘doubleburial’, as isdone elsewherein the same region,on the RyukyuIslands,and onDarnleyIsland,Kraftoand Sakhalin.3Chen Di continuesby informingus that when agricultural work isbeing done nobodyspeaksor kills anything.The aboriginesexplainthatotherwiseHeavenwouldnot help them, the spirits wouldnot grant theirfavoursand they wouldhave one year’s famine.Zhengnotes that amongthe Paiwan,duringthe sowingseason,nobodycan talk on the roads andin the countryside.4Chen Di’s accountof ‘doubleburial’is echoedby the teacherLinQianguang, who seems to have lived in Taiwanbetween1687 and 1691,and wroteBriefNotesonTaiwan[Taiwanjilu ̈e]. He says that whensomeonedies he is buriedin the house.Three days later the peopleof thevillagegather,exhumethe corpseand fill it with alcoholbeforereburyingit, withoutacoffin. When the familymoveshouse they exhumeit againin order to reburyitintheir new house.5Lin Qianguangalso tells us that as soon as womengive birth they arewashedin cold water,at the same time as the new-bornbabies.Heexplainsthat the aborigineshave no medicines,but, wheneverthey are ill,bathe in rivers, claimingthat there are medicinesin the water.6Muchmore extensiveinformation is providedby the administratorHuangShujing(1677–1753), in hisNotesonanInquiryOverseas[Taihaishichalu], probablycomposedaround1736. He dividesthe aboriginesinto 13 groups, ten in the north and three in the south.HuangShujinggives us detailsof the aborigines’funerarycustomsfor each of the 13‘sectors’into whichhe dividesthe island.As regards sector1ofthe north,Huang Shujing says that theaboriginesput the corpsein acoffin, whichis placedtemporarily insidethe deceased’shouse.Zhengcomments that severalTaiwanesegroupings16ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"bury theirdead beneaththe floor of thehouse.Insector2theaborigines buildalittlehut for thedeceasedinsidehis house, andadornit with chicken feathersand little flags.Agood number of theobjectsused by thedeceased in hisdaily life arehungupinsidethe hut.

They have storiesof sexual relationsbetweenhumansand animals, reflectingtheir dependence upon hunting,and they have shamansas well as shamanesses.18As for the Paiwan,Ferrellreportsthat they believetheir chieflyfamiliesto be descendedfrom the sun.

The Paiwanhave specializeddeities,such as agod of thunderand milletand asky-goddessof creationand life. Theyplacatethe spiritsof the dead collectively. Every five years, after the lateautumnharvest,the Paiwanhold their‘Five-YearFestival’(described,aswe have seen, by Zheng).The ancestralspiritsare broughtfrom theirmountainhome to the villages to see that customsare respected. Theystay for five days, and take part in the festival’sspecialball-game.Ballsmade out of bark are thrownin the air by an agriculturalpriest,and menin acircle roundthe priest try to catch them with long bamboopoles.Then the spiritsare sent home to vouchsafe prosperity.19Ferrellsees the Paiwanas closely linguisticallyrelatedto the SaisiyatSaisiyatpeopleof northernTaiwan, who also have specializeddeities,such as amale–femalepair with ‘jurisdictionover all living creatures’,and agod with asnake’sbody, invokedonly to removeevil or grantbenefits.Someof the Saisiyat Saisiyathave four deities,concernedrespectivelywith birth, death,rain and agriculture.Every two years theSaisiyatobserveaceremonyof ‘worshippingthe spirits’,in whichthespirits of the dead are broughtto their territoryand taken roundit beforebeing sent home after five days.20The Ami of the easternseaboardhave complicatedmythsof theoriginsof the world and the gods.

He devotedmuchattentionto the site of Dapenkeng,near Taipeiin northernTaiwan,wherehe founda‘CordedWare’culture datingfromthe fifthmillenniumBCE.Chang also notedahumanlower jawbonefoundonashellmoundon the south-westcoast of Taiwan,whereshellfishgatheringwas importantfrom about 1500BCE.This jawbonehad aholeboredthroughit, evidentlysothat it couldbe carriedwith astring.Apparentlyithad been used as ahandle for agong, as is done today bythe Ifugaoand other inhabitantsof the northernPhilippines.Changobservesthat, since in the Philippinessuch ajaw has usuallybeen takenfrom an enemy,this is evidencefor headhunting in ancientTaiwan. Afterabout2500BCEtooth extractionwas practised,asamongtwentieth-centuryaborigines.22Seventeenyears later Changpublished the fourthedition of abookcalledTheArchaeologyofAncientChina.InNeolithicNorthChina(5000–3000BCE)hefound severalexamplesof secondary burials.Theseare evidencedat the Dawenkousite near the lower YellowRiver.HereChangreportson the skeletalremains:‘Someskullsshow artificialdeformation,and manyhad their upperlateralincisorsextractedinadolescence.’23It has been concludedthat the populationwas of thePolynesiantype. In the late Dawenkou period(c.2900–c.2400BCE)thegravesof the rich containedpigs’ lowerjaws. In NeolithicsouthernChinaChangfinds, oppositeTaiwanand offFukien,early cord-markedpotteryon QuemoyIsland,resemblingthat found in northernTaiwaninthe same period,the fifth millenniumBCE.24Duringthe third millenniumBCEChang sees thedominance, in bothChina andTaiwan, of what he calls ‘Lung-Shan’ cultures,after atownshipin Shantunginnorth-east China.

Asat Chien-kou, these burials havebeenseenasrepresentingrituals relatingto building.25In 1995 Changmade acontributionto avolumeof essaysentitledAustronesianStudiesRelatingtoTaiwan.Here he insistedon the ‘crucialdate’ of 2500BCEas dividingTaiwaneseprehistoryinto two: the earlierphase,recountedabove all by Dapenkengin the fifth millennium, andthe later, ‘Longshanoid’one. The earlierphase is also reflected,as wehave seen, on QuemoyIsland,and furtherby sites on or just offtheChinesemainland.Thus the village of Xitou has pottery‘with rows ofcomb designsand shell-edge tooth patterns’, as on Quemoy.The site ofKeqiutou,on an island offthe Fujiancoast, has potterythat parallelsthatof the Dapenkengculture,notablyin the use of shells to impresspatterns.This appearsin two other coastalsites in easternGuangdong.26Anothercontributorto the same volume,the Taiwanese archaeologistCheng-hwaTsang, considersdata from the Peng-huIslandsin themiddleof the TaiwanStrait,from c.3100to c.2600BCE.Here he findsthat the cord-marked potteryand stone artefacts(net sinkers,hoe-axes,flake knives,etc.) are strikinglysimilarto what has been discovered in theDapenkengcultureof Taiwanand on the Chinesecoast.

Similarmyths are found in Asiaand America,where,as in Taiwan,they also accountfor the origin of themoon.In the same way, many mythsrelate that the sky, after being veryclose to the earth and therebyproducingmuch distressto humans,wasraised to its presentposition.These mythsare paralleledin the islandsofSouth-EastAsia. OtherTaiwanesemythsrelate the origin of manfrom arock, bamboojoints,agourd, eggs, adog ancestoror incest.The motif ofthe rock is aSouth-East Asiantheme,whilethat of bamboojointsbelongsboth to South-East Asia and adjacentareas.Asfor the story ofthe gourd,it is foundonly amongthe Bununin Taiwan,but also in thePhilippines,mainlandSouth-EastAsia and Japan,whereasthe idea thathumanscame out of eggs is found all over the world and the dog ancestormotif is widespreadin east and South-EastAsia. The myth of the world’srepopulationbyincest after aflood is often foundin both South-EastAsia and adjacentareas.Taiwanesemythsfrequentlyspeak of fire beingregainedafter his flood by an animal:this is found in the PhilippinesandMelanesia.30Ho furtherobservesthat Taiwanesemythsaboutmillet and ricereflectbeliefsin the spiritsof both, foundalso in China and South-EastAsia and manifestedin rituals.One myth,told by the Saisiyatgroup,explainsthe origin of the festival that severalof their villageshold everytwo yearsfor the spiritsof the dwarfs(to be distinguishedfrom the‘worshippingthe spirits’ceremonymentioned by Ferrell). The latterused to live in acave, and taughtthe Saisiyatto performthe milletharvestceremony.Then the dwarfsmolestedthe Saisiyat’swomen,andthe Saisiyatexterminated them.Thus, every two years, afestival is heldto appeasetheir spirits.3124ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Ho ̈llmann:The TsouThe Tsou are atiny aboriginalpeople,numberingjust 3,500,inthecentralmountainsof Taiwan.

Afterthis initiationthe boys live in the ‘boys’ house’.In the past the older boysTAIWAN39"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"were allowedto have sexualrelationswith the wivesof the ‘virilewarriors’.Battlestake place betweenthe boys, and military exercisestakeplace at night.71At the age of 18 males enter the ‘men’shouse’.Here all men used tospendtheir time, preparingfor huntingexpeditions. It is centralto theannualheadhunting ritual in December.In this, on the first day, the‘virile warriors’repairthe men’sand boys’ houses.On the seconddaytwo diviners‘cleanthe village’, going to the ancestralcult housesandremovingthe forces of evil containedthere. On the third day two groupsof men make offerings to the protectingancestorsof the two halves of thevillageat the latter’sentrance.Later they put bows and arrowsat thevillage’sgates, to frighten restlessspirits away. On the third day the ‘virilewarriors’preparethe area in whichthe effigy of amonkeyis sacrificedonthe fifth. On the fourthday the two divinersthank the two ancestorswhogave the gift of rice to two brothers: three handfulsof rice are thrownonto arock. Then,as we have seen, boys are initiated.72On the sixth day the ‘virilewarriors’and elders go to the mountain.On the way they make barriers,to put the domesticspiritsand womenbehindthem. Then they camp on their huntingsite. On the seventhandeighthdays the ‘virile warriors’set traps. On the ninth day the 18-year-olds are initiatedinto their three-yearmarginalperiod,and then themales returnto the village.The 21-year-olds end their marginal period,and men and womenwill dance for three nights.Onthe tenth day theeldersexpel pollution from houseswhereadeath has happenedin thepreviousyear. The 18-year-oldsnow have ‘godfathers’,and sleep in theentranceto the men’s house,whilebeing forbiddento engagein sexualrelations,for three years. In the past this periodwas endedby killing anenemy,an aboriginefrom anothergroup,at the end of the annualcycleand bringingback his head. On returningthe youngwarriorhad to stayin ahut outsidethe village,with the head, while the men huntedadeerfor the ‘rite of the deer’ mentionedabove.73The point here, explainsCauquelin,isthat the head’sspirit mightbringdisasterto the villagers.Thus the ‘rite of the deer’ was dulyperformed.Inthe meantimethe youngwarrior‘fed’ the head, addressingit as ‘friend’,explainingthat it liked him and thereforehad met him, andoffering it wine. (He had to keep feeding the head every year, at the endof the ritual in whichthe two ancestorsare thankedfor givingrice.) Theancestorswere calledon to help separatethe head from its spirit.40ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Adiviner effected this by makingan imageof the enemyout of milletpaste. Then the head could be broughtinto the village and put on ashelfabove the latrines in the men’s house.Theremen urinatedwhile sayingto it, ‘You have come here, friend,to strengthenyour centre.’After sevendays it was put on askull rack at the edge of the village. Cauquelinpointsout that in Puyumamyth two brothersbuild the first boys’ house,telltheir father not to come,kill him when he does come and then performthe ‘rite of the deer’.74Puyumainformantshave provideddifferentaccountsof past head-hunting.We are told that it was done beforethe milletharvestandbeforethe pre-sowingrites. It was also done by someonewho felt that hehad been unfairlytreatedwhen judgmentwas given againsthim in adispute,in whichcase, if he came back successful,the decisionwasreversed.Headhunting was also done to avengearelative or punishviolationof afrontier.Avictoriousheadhunterwouldhave agoodharvest.Every year, at the end of the headhuntingritual,men go to thesite of the skull rack, make asubstitutebody and put up astone altar.Then adiviner sets out offeringsof wine and food, and the men circle thealtar three times before kickingit over. This headhunting ritual, observesCauquelin,isalso an initiatoryand apurificatoryone, and the start ofthe new year, when marriagesof the new ‘virilewarriors’are arranged.Headhunting bringsfertility,as in the Philippines and Borneo,where thevictimis also turnedinto afriend,part of society. Women’sheads alsoused to be taken.75Cauquelinprovidesmore information aboutPuyumashamanesses.(A few feminizedmale shamansexist, and in the past some of them weretransvestites.)Afutureshamanessis chosenby aspirit and suffersillnesses.She is investedin aceremonylastingsix days and culminatingin her being given abag (the most importantmoment).After this hersoul, whichhad been taken away, so that she was in effect dead, by thespirit that had chosenher, is restoredto her. Later, to meet the ancestralspiritsand visit their domain,she has to cross abridge. The shamanesseshave agreat annualfestival,lastingeight days,when they visit theancestors. This involves a‘voyage’,whichused to be made to cure theseriouslyill by recallingtheirsouls, stolenby the spirits.76Finally,we may note pointsmade by CauquelinconcerningPuyumaculture,along with more data. Like other Taiwaneseaboriginalgroups,they are indifferent to the sea and the fact that Taiwanis an island.TheTAIWAN41"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Puyumaused to be asociety of hunters,in whicheverythingwas shared.Beforeahuntingexpeditionadiviner wouldconsulthis bamboosplintersto nominateone hunterto take bird omensat dawn.(In generalTaiwaneseaboriginesused to do this any way, for all activities.)Forseveralnightsthe huntershad to sleep in the men’s house,to avoidcontactwith women.If aman out huntingkilled atiger, black bear orsnake he had to stay in asmall hut outsidethe village, like aheadhunter,until adiviner had performedpurificationrituals.77TheGeneralCharacteristicsofTaiwaneseReligionMuchof what we have foundin Taiwanesereligionis very muchthesame. The specialiststhink that this is becausethe different groupshaveall influencedeach other,so that in burialcustoms,for example,therewas amove from varietyto uniformity in burial beneaththe house.It isimportantto bear in mind that there must have been constantchange:this was noted in the seventeenthcentury,whenthe Dutchwere told thatreligiouschangewas goingon in front of them.Here we need tosummarizeand compareour data, beginningwith lifecyclerituals.The practiceof washingnew-bornbabiesin cold water may reflectDutchChristianinfluence,but on the other hand we are told that theaboriginesbelievemedicinesto be presentin river water.As regardsthebirth of twins,the Paiwanare more severe,alwayskillingboth (as thePuyumaused to), whereasthe Tsou do this only in the case of girls. BothTsou and Puyumafathersare prohibitedfrom going to the fields andhuntingafter abirth. The extractionof teeth is done, says Chen Di, toadd to girls’ beauty,whereasHuangShujingreportsthat in one villagebride and groomdo this to indicate that they will never separate. Asregardsmarriagein general,there is evidenceof widespreadmatriliny,and both uxorilocal(the groomenteringthe bride’sfamily)and virilocal(the reverse)marriage.The Tsou bridegroom’s workfor his father-in-lawis evidentlyavestige of the former.Divorceis easy, whileadulteryisusuallypunishedby afine and pre-marital sex is generally allowed.Deathis followedby ‘doubleburial’in the house,accordingto theseventeenth-century Chinesesources.For the eighteenthcenturyHuangShujingconfirmsburialin the house.The reason,itappearsfromZheng’scommentary,is that accordingto some groupsburyingthe‘good dead’ in acemeterywouldbe to put them amongevil spirits.One42ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"notes that in the northernsector 8the familyis obligedto stay insidethehousefor 12 days, and then the local shamanessis asked to pray andmake offerings.In the northernsector 9the body is buriedon the top ofamountain,as happensin the southernsector 2when awomandies inchildbirth.As we have seen, the Atayalbelievethat adead person’s spiritgoes to the top of ahigh mountain.Likewise,the Tsou believethat adead person’s bodily soul goes back to the mountains,whilethe spiritstays in the neighbourhood.The spiritsof peoplewho die a‘bad death’have to be prevented,as far as possible,from causingharm.AmongthePaiwansuch peoplehave to be put in alarge water-filledjar, and amongthe Tsouthey are buriedfar from the house.Finally, we may note thatamongthe Puyuma,on the tenth and last day of the annualheadhuntingfestival,the old men drive the ‘pollutionsof death’from the housesinmourning,and that previouslythis festival was held at the end of theharvest.Like death,headhunting is aprominentfeatureof the materialsthatwe have surveyed.One notes Pickering’sevidencethat the brains,mixedwith alcohol, wouldbe consumed,and Imbault-Huart’stestimonythatthe victimwas welcomedby the headtakersand told to bringhisrelatives.The Puyumaused to welcomethe head as afriend, ‘feeding’it.HuangShujingsays that in the southernsector2headhuntingisobligatoryafter one of the aboriginesis killed:the male heirs sacrificethehead to their dead relative.This partlyties in with one of the Tsoumyths:headhunting, we are told there,is reciprocal,and is due topeoples’dispersing and living far away from each other.In this myth,however,the real originalcause of headhunting is pleasure.AnotherTsoumyth attributespleasureat headhuntingto the supremespirit. AChinesechronicleof 1716 says that headhunting is done becauseanyonewhokills humanswins great popularity. Amongthe Puyumatakingaheadwas an obligatory part of ayoung warrior’sinitiation:afterwardshe hadto stay in ahut outsidethe village, before being reintegratedinto societyby aritual in an ancestralcult house.Headhunting was linkedto theagriculturalcycle, and broughtfertility,as well as purification.Tsou headhuntinggreatlyresemblesTsou huntingof animals.Inboththe leaderconsultsabird oracle,the oaimu,and the men practisedivinationby dreams,spending the nightin the common-house.(Similarly, Puyumahunterssleep in the men’s house,to avoid contactwith women.)

It is thesame sector that has the five-yearlyfestivalstill held amongthe Paiwan.Amongthe Tsou the headhunters’shout of victoryis repeatedfive timeson the march home.In aTsou myth of the originof millet we are toldthat in the beginningamillet plant could bear fruit five times,and whencookedfive grains wouldfill the saucepan.Duringthe first five days afteraTsou burialthe communityis in seclusionand, on the fifth, aspecialritual is performed.(Wemay add that, in aTsou ritual not noted above,46ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"five arrowsused to be offered to the earth-spirit when ownershipof landwas transferred.)79Amongthe Paiwan one story says that the ancestor-deitieshad five children.Both the Paiwanand the Saisiyatmake thespiritsof the dead stay for five days in their festivals.The firstPaiwanshamanessis one of five sisters.Inthe case of a‘bad death’amongthePuyumathe dead person’s spirit is ‘recalled’after five years. Otherwisefive does not seem significantfor the Puyuma.Othernumbersappearto be of little importance.The Puyuma,however,are again anomalous.For them six is the numberof days for ashamaness’sinitiation, and seven is important,as the numberof beakersand piecesof meat offered to the spirits.Seven is also, for the Puyuma,the numberof days of restrictionsfor afather after abirth, and of daysfor exposinganewly-takenhead on ashelf. Eight is the numbersfor thePuyumashamanesses’ annualfestival. Returningto the Taiwanese fieldin general,we find that nine is the numberof days of the Tsousowingfestival.Ten is the numberof days for whichaTsou mother,afterdelivery,cannotgo out of the house,while her husbandis not allowedtogo near anythinginvolvedinviolence.The Puyumaheadhunting festivaltakes place over ten days.Twelve days make up the periodof mourning,says HuangShujing,in the northernsector8. Both parts of the Tsouharvestfestivalalso lasted 12 days.In conclusion, we may observethat Taiwaneseaboriginal religionischaracterizedby specificbeliefsand practicesrelatedto the dead,headhunting and annualfestivals.As regards the dead, ‘doubleburial’and burial in the house are also prominent. Headhuntingis religious: thehead is sacrificedto adead relativeor supremespirit.Linkedtoheadhunting is the annual festival-cycle, dominatedby the harvestfestival.Nowburialin the houseis linkedto the widespreadAustronesianbelief that aperson has two souls, one of whichgoes tothe next worldand one of whichstays behind.Thus the practice,alsowidespreadin the Austronesianfield, of burialbeneathor very close tothe houseevidentlycorrespondsto fear that the soul that stays behindwouldbe attackedby evil spirits if its body weretobeburied far away. Adeath necessitates aheadhunting expedition, the idea apparentlybeingthat the victim,welcomedinto the community, ‘replaces’the deadpersonas an active producer and providerin agriculture,huntingandgeneralprosperity.

Thus at burialthe deceasedis giventhingsfittingto his rank: abow and arrow,ornamentsand kitchenutensils.The dead influencelife on earth,grantingprotectionand success.1Accordingly,the Biaks have woodenimagesof their dead.

A‘Sir Ghost’ is usuallykind to hisfamily,but inflictsdeathon others.The ghost of someonewho hasrecentlydied, if it is that of apoliceman,is apolicemanafter death,responsible to abureaucracyof ghosts.15As for the ‘oracles’,they tend to identifysome sin that has caused‘SirGhost’to inflictan illness.‘Oracles’are eitherdiviners, men,ormediums,women.Adiviner rubs two bones,linkedby astring, whenputtingaquestion,and then throwsthem across his shoulder:one bonefalls on his chest, one on his back.

The latter’sghost speaksto her in ase ́ance andtransmitswhat is said by the family’s‘Sir Ghost’ or other ghosts.Alongwith divinersand mediums,the Manusalso consultseers from amongthe Usiai,who diagnosesins by dreamingor becomingpossessed.TheManushave many mythsthat mock the Usiai’smagicalfamiliarspirits,thetchinal,asmischievousogres.However,if there is aseriousillness,and all else has failed,the Manuswill resort to Usiaitchinal-derivedblackmagic.16Adifferent kind of Manusmagicis associatedwith the ghostson thetiny, uninhabitedislandsin the lagoons.These ghostsare older and lackindependentpowers,but obey the incantationsof those in arelationshipwith them, in amatrilinealgrouping.Amongcross-cousins,that is to saychildrenof abrotherand sister,the children of asister have aspecialmagico-religious powerover the childrenof abrother.This powercan beused to curse and to bless.17Fortuneillustrateshis overview with anarrativefrom his fieldworkdiary.

They believethat after deathspiritsgo to aworld divided into compartments,dependingon how onehas died. This world is on an island,reachedby aferry. Sometimesthespiritsare reincarnatedin animals,and somepeopleexplain that122ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"everyonehas two souls, one their reflectionon water,one their shadowon land. The Yabem imaginethat sorcerycauses all deaths(exceptthoseof the very old). They also believethat aghostneeds fire, in order to beguidedto the sorcererwho has murderedit. So, on the eveningof aburial,they make afire and carry it in aprocessioninto the forest,wherethey leave it for the ghost. But the ghost of amurderedpersonalso has tobe drivenaway with shoutingand drumming,and with the help of amodelof acanoe, to takethe ghosttothe land of the dead. The Yabemusuallybury their dead close to their houses,and put ahut on the grave,for the familyto live in for at leastsix weeks.At times the bodiesofimportantpeopleare tied up in ahouse till only the bones remain.20Muchattentionis given by Frazer to Yabemcircumcision,whichhesees as arite of death and resurrection.He pointsout that the Yabemword for ‘ghost’,balum,also means a‘bull-roarer’,an instrumentfoundamongmany peoplesand consistingof apiece of wood in the shape of afish. This is tied to apiece of string and whirledto makethe soundof aroaringbull. The bull-roarer is much used in the Yabem’s circumcisionritual.Whenthe youthsset offtothe forest for this the womenhowl inthe belief that the youngmales will be swallowedby aghost-monster,abalum.This is representedby along hut, in whichthey stay for three orfour months.21Aneighbouringpeople on the coast,the Bukawa,have extremelysimilarcustoms.They believethat the spirits of enemieswhomthey havekilled pursuethem to their village and blind them.Thus returning andsuccessfulwarriorsdance wildlyaroundahuge fire, throwingbrandsinthe directionof the enemy.But the Bukawasee their own ancestralspiritsas likely to help them, notablyin agriculture,and so they pray to themwhen plantingtheir fields. Again,at harvest time, apart of the first fruitsis offered to the ancestors.As amongthe Yabem,ahut is erected over anew grave (dug next to the house),and awidowerstays secludedin it.22Finally,Frazer considersthe Tamipeople,most of whomlive onislandsto the south-eastof the Yabem and are seafaringtraders.Theybelievethat everyonehas a‘long’ soul. Identicalwith the shadow,whichis absentin sleep, and is locatedin the stomach.After death it flies offtoavillage on the north coast of NewBritain.The Tami also believethatone has a‘short’ soul, whichabandonsthe body only after death,andwaits near it beforegoing to the land of the dead in the underworld.They bury corpsesbeneathhousesor near them,and think that theEASTERNMALAYO-POLYNESIANSPEAKERS123"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"‘short’soul takes the offeringsmade to the dead.

This vigil lasts some eight days,and alargeamountof food and drink is consumed.After two or three years theperiodof mourningends. Dancing goes on all night long for up to eightor ten days, at first solemnlybut finallyin acomic manner.Somefamiliesdig up the bones when the flesh has rottedaway and keep themin the housefor two or three years, beforeburying them in the earthagain.23The Tami have other beliefs,notablyindeities (buwun), to be foundon an islandwhereno humanslive. They have humanheads and thebodiesof fish, but appearas men in their lust for women.Thebuwunareresponsible for earthquakesand epidemics.By contrast,there is agoodgod, not to be feared,called Anuto,the creatorof heaven,earth, the firstman and the first woman.Anutois given the first portionoffood at feastsand markets:it is put in abasket and takeninto the forest.Moreover, theTami believein very old spiritscalledTago,w hich correspondto clansand families.The Tago are representedby maskedmen, their bodiescoveredwith leaves: these mendance in acircle to the accompanimentofsingingand drumming.At times they go roundthe village and throwpebblesor fruit at other men. This happensevery ten or 12 years, andgoes on for awhole year,during whichcoconutsmay not be eaten.24Thesedeities and spirits,however,are unimportantcomparedto thespiritsof the dead, and in particular the recentlydead of one’s ownfamily:ancestorworshiprarely goes back beyondone’s grandfather.Suchworshipis informal:aman offers acigar to aspirit to drive fish towardshim. As for the land of the dead in the underworld, it is more beautifulthan this world of ours, with so much fruit that work is not needed.Butpeoplethere quarrel,are ill and die. In the last case they becomeworms,ants or wood-spirits.To enter the land of the dead one must cross ariver.25Hogbin:ReligiononWogeoIn 1970 the Australiananthropologist Ian Hogbinpublished astudy ofreligionon the islandof Wogeo,offnorth-eastNew Guinea,based onfieldworkdone in 1934 and 1948.He beginsby lookingat Wogeocultureheroesin myths.Such heroesform acategoryof spirits,who124ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"createdorder out of chaos,and then disappeared, takingwith them onlythe ‘shadow’of things.In onemyth, duringafamine,the daughter of aculturehero marriesa‘bush hero’ in the forest,but her fellowvillagerssmashhim to piecesand pulverizehim, his penis alone remaining.Hisgrievingwidowburiesthis, and it turns into agiant taro. In anothermyth ahero marriesaghost and pelts it with stonesuntil it falls downand seemslifeless. Severalmonths later he discovers the first coconutpalm.

In yet anothermyth ahero commitsadulterywith the wife of hisbloodbrother.The latter buildsamen’s common-houseand persuadesthe adultererto descendinto apost hole and make magic,so that thebuildingwill be secure.Thenhedrops apost onto him and fills the holein with earth, but the hero turns into an insect and escapes.26Anothercategoryofspirits consistsof the souls of the dead. Theyoriginatein an essencethat appearsin one’s shadow.After death the soulis drivenaway by mourners,and goes to the mountainsin the centreofthe island,where the land of the dead is situated.Most of the Wogeosaythat the soul can come back as aghost, but otherssay that avisible ghostoriginatesfrom anotheressence,which appearsinone’s reflectioninwater.27Athird categoryofspirits is that of the ‘monsters’. One kind of theseare calledlewa, whichalso means‘mask’,and are linkedto fooddistributions. The spirit monstersare impersonatedby men: in the caseof menfrom the village(as opposedto the bush) this meansthat they aremaskeddancers.During such afood distribution the gatheringof ripecoconutsis forbidden.The other kind of monstersare callednibek,whichalso means‘flute’,and they appearin apreludeto large-scalefestivals.Such festivalsare held when acommon-house is built or avillageheadmandecidesthat there is asufficientlyimportantreason.Themonstersare summonedbeforedawn on the beach,and flutes are playedfor severalweeks.Enormousamountsof food are placedon aplatform,and then taken home by families.Eventually the monstersare sent backto the spirit world,and gingeris used ‘to removethe coldnessof thespirits’and its dangers.28Hogbinalso notes identical ceremoniesin the initiationof boys andgirls. Whenboys are admitted to the men’scommon-houseorclub forthe first time they are made to stand in aline outside.Severalyouthscome forward,carryingfood,and circle the boys three times,goingEASTERNMALAYO-POLYNESIANSPEAKERS125"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"counter-clockwise.When agirl is initiatedon the occasionof her firstmenstruation she and her ‘companions’ofthe same age stand in line inthe centreof the village,and severalyouthsact in the same way as withthe boys.29As regardsdeath,Hogbinreportsthat duringthe night after it takesplace the close relatives wail and embracethe corpseinsidethe house,while other relatives sing outside.The next day agrave is dug belowthehouse,whichis raised offthe ground on piles. Then the corpseis buried,with the head facingthe rising sun. At the same time arelativedrives thespirit of the deceasedout of the land of the living,prancingfrom east towest and then back to east again,brandishing aspear and atorch andspittinggingerysaliva.Finally,he yells and throwsthe spear and torchafter the spirit, whichis said to go to the east of the island and then thenext world.If the deceasedwas amature man and had descendantsthechief mourner will eventuallyrecoverthe jawboneand some other bones.This is done after three or four years, and the bonesare carriedondangerousjourneysin war or on the sea. If awoman dies in childbirthoraman is killed in battle or murderedby violencethe burialis done atonce, in the bush, and there is no ceremonyor mourning. It is explainedthat peoplewho die asudden death are so extremelyuncleanthat contactwith them wouldcertainlybefatal.30Seligman:ReligioninSouth-EastNewGuineaAmassive surveyof the Austronesian-speaking peoplesof south-eastNewGuineawas published in 1910 by the leadingBritishanthropologist C.G. Seligman,based on fieldworkdone in 1898 and 1904.He devotesmuchattentionto tribes speaking the Roro language.Here we againencounterthe ‘deathchair’ in whichacorpse is placed,and then thepositioningof the latter’shead towardsthe rising sun. The burial is doneunder the house of the deceased.As for warriorswho had causeddeathsin successfulexpeditions, they had to go into seclusionin the ‘clubhouseof the war magicexperts’(paihamarea), as they were purifiedfrom thepollutionof blood.This clubhouse, like that of the war chiefs,receivedavolleyof spearsfrom the victoriouswarriorswhen they returnedfromtheir expedition.31Seligmanalso providesinformation aboutcannibalism in anearbyarea, that of what he calls the ‘SouthernMassim’population.Usually thiscannibalismis done in revenge,but sometimesin desire for flesh, and,126ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"extremelyrarely,recentlyburiedcorpsesare dug up to be eaten.In onerevengeattack,describedin detail,aman is captured,broughthome andspearedby as many warriorsas can reach him.

After this he is burnt to death,cut up,cookedand eaten. Skulls from earliercannibalfeasts are put on sticks andheld by the warriorsabove their heads as they dance.32Burialsin the ‘SouthernMassim’area have traditionallybeen doneclose to the houses,sometimesacouple of yards away. To some extentskulls have been exhumedand put in crevassesin rocks.After death thecorpseis proppedup in the middleof the houseand then buriedin asquattingposition,facingthe east, so that the deceasedcan reach the nextworld.Abig mortuaryfeast, called thetoreha,isheld ayear or later afteradeath, for all the deathssince the lasttoreha.33The peopleof this area, says Seligman, do not seem to have anyworshipof gods or spirits,thoughthey believein mythicalbeings,mostlymalevolent:‘ogres’.In the hamletof Wagawaga,onthe coast, the spiritof adead personis calledarugo,w hich also means‘shadow’or ‘reflection’in water.After death it goes to the other world,whichis beneaththe sea.It is like this world,and is presidedover by a‘big man’. On the smallislandof Tubetube the spirit is calledyaruyarua,but this is not, as onemightimaginegiven parallelexamples,the word for the shadowof aliving person.It remainsnear the corpse until burial,and then goes to ahill on anotherisland:there the spiritsget married, have childrenandmake gardens.34After this Seligmangoes on to the peoplewhomhe calls the ‘NorthernMassim’,the inhabitants of the islandsto the east of south-eastNewGuinea.In this people’sburialcustomsthe skull and other bonesareexhumed.On the islandofMurua burial is done by women,beneaththehouse,and two monthslater they exhumethe body and smokethebones.Later they are placedin caves on cliffs.35Malinowski:TheSpiritsoftheDeadintheTrobriandIslandsEven greaterdetail about death in some of these islandswas providedbythe famousPolishanthropologist Bronisław Malinowski,in an articlepublishedin 1916 and based on fieldworkdone from 1915.

It is also believedthat the life of the spirit in Tumacomesto an end with old age, when it becomesan embryo.Afemalespirit takes this to the TrobriandIslandsand puts it in awoman’s womb.Thus there is reincarnation,and auniversal explanationfor pregnancy.Alternatively,it is believedthat an embryofloatson the sea andimpregnates awoman when bathing.38WeinerontheTrobriandIslandersAmore recentoverviewof the Trobriandershas been providedby the USanthropologistAnnetteWeiner,published in 1988and basedonfieldworkdone from 1971.

Themourners‘cry’ four times aday. Important paymentsare made to the‘workers’.In the past the deceased’sskull and arm bonesweredisinterred,but then the governmentbanned‘secondaryburial’.Beforethat, in the case of achief, the skull, adornedwith red paint and cowrieshells, was put on top of acliff. This had to be precededby an enormousdistribution of large yams, and could take place 15 to 20 years after thedeath.Such adistribution wouldbe the culminationof many smaller-scale distributions, followingan important‘women’smortuarydistribu-tion’ four to eight monthsafter the death.39Weiner also supplements Malinowski’sinformation aboutthe harvestfestival. This lasts from July untilSeptember.Achiefwillholdadancingcompetition, andinviteyoung andunmarriedpeople from variousvillages to nightlydances,which continueuntil dawn.The dancersthrust theirlower bodies forward provocativelytothe soundofdrums,andchase andgrabone anotherbeforecouples go into thebush to makelove.Thiscontrasts withthe discretion observed during therest oftheyear.40Mosko:TheBushMekeo’sBurialandDeathFeastsIn 1985 the US anthropologistMark Moskopublished astudy of theBush Mekeopeopleofsouth-eastNew Guinea.He devotesmuchattentionto burialand mortuaryfeasts, and providesplentyof usefulinformation.

She beginsby tellingthe story of the Mekeo’sculturehero, A’aisa.As asmall boy he was foundby an old woman,who adoptedhim. Hewent huntingwith the village’sgrownmen, and caughtalot of game,whichthey stole. A’aisa took his revengeby stealing their women,whomhe eventually returned.Then he gave peopleknowledgeof rituals,andinstitutedthe roles of the ‘man of kindness’,the ‘man of the spear’, the‘man of cinnamonbark’ and the ‘man of sorrow’.He also createddeath,sorceryand jealousy.Finally, A’aisa left to join the shadesof the dead inthe west, on ahill on the coast.43The Mekeo,Stephenreports,say that they believein many spirits,whichcan be contactedby a‘man of sorrow’, apowerful ritual specialistwho lives apart, on the edge of the bush. Of these spiritsthe ones mostmentionedare of the dead, who are sometimespresentaroundhouses,asthey used to be buriedbeneaththem. Sometimesthey appearin the formof wild animals.The Mekeoalso say that they believein water spirits,whichlive in the river and pools,and are invokedto bring rain and fish.They resembleEuropeansand are importantas agentsof illness.44In reality,Stephenobserves, Mekeobelief is far more sophisticatedand complicatedthan their publicstatementssuggest.Itisfoundedon‘secretknowledge’,for examplein fish-callingrituals, used to call big fishin from the sea to the river and makerain to flood the area so that the130ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"fish can come.Once,amyth tells us, aman made the firstfish trap, butdid not includevital elements.

M. Hocartpublished along articleon religionon the tinyisland of Simbo,in the west of the SolomonIslands,based on fieldwork done in 1908. He beginsby notingthat theislandershave chiefs,whoseactivitiesgenerally endedwith the endingofheadhunting: thus informantscomplainthat nowadays nobodyis mightyand peopleare all alike. Beneathchiefs there were older marriedmen,foundersof families,and then youngermarriedmen and bachelors.46Hocart,discussingdeath on Simbo,observesthat the wordfor ‘soul’,galagala,also means‘shadow’,‘reflection’. At death the soul comesoutby the mouthand stays beneaththe ridge of the roof. If aman is killed bythe Spiritsof WastingSicknesshe is quicklydumpedin the sea.Normally,however,the corpseis deckedout in fine clothesand taken tothe sea-shore, whereit is seatedfacingwest. Immediatelyafterwards,oron the third day, there is the ritual of the ‘catchingofthe soul’. Amediumholds out aleaf and falls unconsciousas the soul enters it: thenthe leaf is put in the roof of the house.There awidow has to stay insideasmall enclosure.Friends come and sleep in the house,becauseshe will befrightenedofthe ghost.Womenwail and men sing for four nights.Sometimeswidowshave hangedthemselvesto followtheir husbands.Inthe past aslave wouldbe killed to honouradead chief, his head beingplacedby the chief’sbody while his own body was throwninto the sea.47Afeast is held on the fourthday: apair of puddingsis made out offour times four sweet yams, and the numberfour is repeated several timesEASTERNMALAYO-POLYNESIANSPEAKERS131"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"in aprayer that evokesand enablesthe journeyof the soul to the land ofthe dead, Sonto.Shortlyafterwardsa‘captive’is broughtto the widow:this (or, in previous times,the obtainingof ahead) sets her free.

The ghosts come from Sontobycanoe and fetch the deceased.Sonto seemsto be in Bougainville:therethe ghostswork like the living,in ahuge cave.48On the 50th day acommoner’sfinal feast is held. Acoconuttree isplantedby the skull-house and alarge banquettakes place. In the case ofachief the feast is held much later, and has the same name,Vavolo,as thewar feast. Hocartexplainsthat this is becausepreviouslyahead wasobtained.Two or three dead chiefs are honouredatthe same time. Avastamountof food is preparedfor manyguests. Men sing to theaccompanimentof flutes all night long, and then pigs are killed,cutup and shared.49Hocartexplainsthat the word for ‘ghost’(tomate)also designatesotherspirits.Men who die by fallingofftrees and womenwho die in childbirthare called ‘evil spirits’and are throwninto the sea. Other evil spirits causeillnesses,notablyaspirit whichrides on the rainbow.Alongsidespiritsthere are gods (tamasu), which are dividedinto gods of crops and weathergods.

Athird god, Magoana,is responsiblefor the profusion of coconutsand bananasinSimbo,andcan raise the south-westwind. As for the weathergods, they cause storms,and can be inducedto do so, or made to still them,by the use ofcharms.50It is furtherreportedbyHocart that the peopleof Simbohave anewyear festivalin June, just before the small canarynuts are ripe. (Simboisrich in nuts, which it exports.)On each side of the skull-housetwo sprays132ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"of small canaryleaves are tied, and puddingsare made, incorporatingthepreviousyear’s large canarynuts.

By then Christianityhad virtuallyextinguishedthe traditionalreligion,so that only afew old men knewmuchaboutit. TheChoiseulesehad gods (bangara), ‘good spirits’(sinipi), who revealedlostmoney,‘wild spirits’,who weremalevolent,and the spiritsor ghostsofthe dead. As for the gods,they were stronger than the spirits(manuru),and got the ‘first fruits’of the smokednuts. Whenadescentgroupintendedto make araid agod’s ‘keeper’would, if the god lived in thesea, go out there in acanoe to take an oracle:if the canoerockedtheanswerwas favourable.Agod had animals that ‘followed’it: fish, birdsand snakes,whichalso sometimesacted as oracles. Beforearaid theymightfly over the enemy,bringingbad luck.52As for ghosts, the ones most veneratedwere those of ‘managers’or‘big-men’,the main leadersof descentgroups.After death all the ghostsof agroup came to the deceased’svillage to accompanythe new ghost tothe land of the dead, in Bougainville, wherethey lived an easy life. Thecorpsewas usuallycremated,but sometimes buriedand subsequentlyexhumed.Later there was the ‘gettingofthe bones’:the bones and asheswere taken to the group’sancestral shrine,and there was afeast. Groupsthat did not practisecremationpreserved their managers’ skulls in specialshrines.53Regardingthe vexedsubjectsof headhunting and cannibalism,Scheffler observesthat manySolomonislanderspractisedboth on alavishscale. An earlierobserver,the BritishsurveyorS.G.C.Knibbs,paintsan horrificpicture, namingthe ‘Meso-Melanesian’-speakingRovianapeopleof New Georgiaas the greatestheadhunters, but sayingthat they do not seem to have eaten their victims, but merelycollectedEASTERNMALAYO-POLYNESIANSPEAKERS133"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"skulls for their men’s common-houses.On ShortlandIsland(also in thenorth-westSolomons)the buildingof such acommon-housewasaccompaniedby the sacrificeof ahuman being,crushed as apost camedown into its hole.54Some Choiseuleseadmittedthat previouslytheirwarriorsate small strips of humanflesh and muscletakenfrom the calvesof enemiesthat they had killed,in order to acquiretheir effectiveness,anger and courage.Humansacrificealso took place: ‘captives’,normallyyoungchildren,weretaken from other groups,to ‘replace’amanagerwho had just died,and sometimesthis was in order to kill them and spilltheir blood over the manager’s ashes or anew war canoe.55Epstein:ThePersonAmongtheTolaiIn 1999 the Britishanthropologist A.

E. Fox, based on fieldworkdone since 1908.His surveyof religionthere beginswith spirits (figona), the chief of whichappearin the form of snakes.Thereis asupremespirit,Agunua,thecreatorof all things.One femaleserpent-spirit sometimesasks for ahumansacrifice.In one versionof her story she is called ‘Eight Fathoms’.Aman cuts her into eight pieces, but after eight days these are reunited.Then she is again cut into eight pieces,and after eight showers of rain isbroughtback to life. Shepromisesto grant afruitfulgardenand successin war. The peopleof San Cristovalalso believein ghostsand lesserspirits.Of the latter the spiritsof the sea travel along the rainbow,whichterrifiespeopleinto runninginto their houses.59San Cristovalreligionincludesimportant stages in aboy’s education,notably,in the case of a‘bush-boy’,‘instructionin killing’.For this aman is killed and the corpseis taken to the boy, who spears it and eats abit of the right arm. In the case of acoast-boytwo years’ seclusion in acanoe-houseis imposed.Thesemilitarytraditionsare echoedin death:wheneverthis happensmen at once engagein jubilation,to stop anenemy’sbeing the firsttodoso. Aman’s death is followed by ‘the buyingafter him’: the buyingof achild, who is adoptedto replacethe dead man,or, in the case of achief, that of aman, who is killed and eaten. Such aman will generallybe obtainedalong way away. If he does not arrive themen becomerestless,and they all swap their wives for two or morenights.Then,in the end, anotherchief providesone of his youngmen tobe killed instead.60The peopleof San Cristovalhave anumberof other beliefsandpractices.They believethat aperson has two souls, theaunga,whichcorrespondsto one’s reflection,and theadaro,which correspondstoone’s shadow.The formeris good, the latter bad.

G. Ivens publishedastudydevotedto the villageofSa’ain south-east Malaitaand the islandofUlawa,to the east, based on observationsdating from 1896 to 1925. Hegives us plentyof information about humansacrifices.On the death of achief gongsare beatenrapidly,sendingthe messages‘Offwith ahead!’and ‘Whosehead am Ioffered?’ Killingmust be done to end mourning.The chief may, beforedying,have accusedsomeoneof murderinghim bymagic,and the personwill be hunteddown to serve as the victim.A‘bigdeath feast’ is held, and at some point the victim’sbody is brought.Sometimes,instead,alive personused to be boughtin order to replacethe deceased,and adopted.People adoptedin this way could be killed asvictims.If avictim is killed along way away the head alonemay bebrought.63The peopleofSa’aand Ulawaalso have importantcults of ghostsandsharks.Ancestralghostsare seen as benevolent,and may inhabitasharkor swordfish.‘Tutelary’sharksare invoked in dangerat sea. Pigletsusedto be burnt as offeringsat altars for the ghosts,and achief or commonerwoulddo this for his ancestors. The altars consistedof circlesof stonespiled up to form walls, with afireplacemade of rocks inside.Pigletsweresacrificedat the birth of achild, and also to remove‘ceremonialdefilement’,whichangered aghost and thus perhapsbroughtillness or136ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"bad luck. Such defilementscould be causedby cursing or indirectcontactwith women.Sacrificeswere also made beforeawar, to the two warghosts,that of the chiefs and that of the commoners.64Keesing:KwaioReligionandtheMythofManaThe Canadian-based anthropologist RogerKeesinghas producedseveralstudiesof the Kwaioof centralMalaita.In one of them,publishedin1992,he gives abrief overview of Kwaioreligion.The Kwaio,he says,rarely talk about origins,and, if pressed,say that humans‘came out ofthe earth’.Only afew expertsrelate myths,such as astory that asnakegave birth to the first humanbeings.By contrast,the ghostsofthe deadare omnipresentin Kwaiolife. The soul has two parts,one whichgoes tothe land of the dead (on an islet offMalaita’snortherntip), and onewhichremainsto watchover the living.Ancestralghostspunishthelivingfor breakingrules,and such violationsmust be ‘washed’bysacrificingpigs. They cause disasters,and thus requirethe consultationofdiviners.Mortuary feastingis also very important:an ordinarymansponsorsone or two in his lifetime,but an influentialleadermay sponsor50, and each involvesdozensof investments.The deathof aseniorpersonnecessitatesrituals lastingmanymonths beforethe taboosarefinallylifted. Otherritualsused to be demandedby avictim of murder,and were performedupon the murderer’sbody. Thus,in vengeance,cannibalismwas practisedupon enemygroups, and also upon incestuouscouplesabandoned by their relatives: the aim was to demotethose eatento the rank of animals.65In 1987 Keesingpublishedan encyclopaediaarticlein whichhedemolishedthe widespreadfallacythat in Oceanicreligionsthere existedan omnipresentand invisiblesubstance calledmana,which providedspiritualpower.He points out that in the languagesof Malaitamanaisan adjective, meaning‘effective’, or averb, ‘to be effective’.To make anoun,‘effectiveness’,one has to add asuffix. The illusionof an all-pervasiveenergy calledmanawas createdin the nineteenthcenturyby apioneering observerin the SolomonIslandsand then spreadby others.66MicronesiaKiribatiThe religionof Kiribatihas been well describedby Frazer, on the basis ofnineteenthand early-twentieth-centurystudies.He notesthe severeEASTERNMALAYO-POLYNESIANSPEAKERS137"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"punishments for incest:sometimesthe offenderswouldbe asphyxiatedinapool of water,sometimesthey were set adrift in the sea on alog andsometimesthey were sent offonacanoe.In the last case the idea was thatthe sun wouldrefuse to shine on them: the idea is linkedto amythicalhero, Bue, who committedincest with his sister beneaththe sun (theirfather)at noon,whereuponthe sun wreckedtheir boat.67As regardsdeath,Frazerobservesthat the corpsewas usuallyburiedbeneaththe house’sfloor. Often the skull was preserved,and plantedinthe groundfor the relativesto visit when seekinghelp from the deceased.The soul was identifiedwith the shadow,and believedto live ahappy lifeon anearby island.Sothe islandersworshippedtheir ancestors,but theyalso worshippedgods. Of these most peopleworshipped Tabuariki,agod of thunderveneratedin the form of astone, who had awife,Lightning.Alongside him were Auriaria,whosehair is to be seen in theappearanceof afew stragglingbushes;Teweia,who was extremelymurderous towardsthose who crossedhim; and Riiki,who separatedheavenand earth and createdthe firstman and woman.68More on religionin Kiribatiis to be foundin the writings of one ofFrazer’ssources, the BritishadministratorSir ArthurGrimble(1888–1956),basedon fieldworkdone between1916 and 1932.Grimblerecordsanumberof spells:love spells,an invocation to the sun, aspellfor stealingone’s neighbour’s fruit and aspell for killingsomeone.Suchspells have to be repeatedthree times.Grimblealso gives us mythsof thebeginnings.At first, we are told in oneofthese, there were just ‘theDarknessand the Cleavingtogether’,and one man called Na AreauteMoa-ni-bai(Sir Spiderthe first-of-things).He told the Sand and theWaterto producechildren,and they producedamale and afemale child,who broughtforth childrenof their own. The youngestof these was alsocalledNa Areau,and fatheredanumberof ‘ancestors’,notably‘Kaniiand the skull Batuku’,who were ‘Kingsbeneaththe tree of Samoa’, theirfood beingthe ‘headsof the eldestchildrenof the peopleof Niku-maroro’.69Grimblegoes into more detailaboutbirth and death.After birthmotherand baby had to stay in the north end of the house for three days,so that the child wouldbe protectedbyafemalespirit who lived in thenorth.Abonfireblazed close to the house’seasternside, and the relativesdancedaroundit: this was to encourage the child’ssoul to take upresidencein its body.

The latter had six children,whosemother gaveBue six thingswhen he set offtosee his father:two red coral stones,onefruit of thenontree, one coconut,one seed coconutleaf and one coconuttree leaf. Bue, using these,duly caughthis fatherat dawn,on his six‘mountingplatforms’:three belowand three abovethe sea.

Elsewhere,in Polynesia, the trickster-heroMauitakes six noosesto catch the sun.71Grimblealso tells us about the pandanusharvestritual,in Septemberor October. Arock was surroundedby stones,whichenclosed the skullsof clan elders.The rock was crownedwith three red coral blocks,in apile, and representedthe god Auriaria.It was at this rock that the ritual was observed,at sunset,on the secondday of the new moon after the harvest.Aball of sweet was brought,madefrom coconuttoddy and desiccatedpandanus.Aclan elder presentedthefood to the Sun, the Moon,Auriariaand other gods and spirits,and hisinvocationwas recitedthree times.After this he gave asmall part of thefood to the Sun, the Moonand Auriaria and dividedalmostall of the restbetweenthose present,the remnant belongingto all the gods,spirits andghosts.72As regardsheadhunting and cannibalism Grimble feels that both werecommonamongthe Samoans who came to Kiribatiabout22–25generationsbefore. Traditionrelatesthat the previously mentionedBatuku-the-skull,King of Samoa, lived offthe heads of peoplewhomhischildrenkilled.Thesechildrenkilled men to be rollersfor their canoe,and then went on avoyage,on whichthey killedahundredpeople,cuttingofftheir heads to serve as their canoe’scrests.Itappearsthat theheads of the ‘first-bornand beardedand bald’ were preferred.

Thus ayoung wife’s mother-in-law’s brothercould,with her husband’spermission, have intercoursewith her. Maudepointsout that in most of Kiribatithis particular relationshipwasforbidden,but aman could have intercoursewith his daughter-in-law(thoughthis met with extremedisapproval,says Grimble),the wife of hisbrother’sson, his mother-in-lawand the latter’ssister. Grimblesays thatthe practicewas almostuniversal, like wife-exchange,and the man wouldgive land or goods.In practiceit was usuallyarelationshipbetweenayoungman’s wife and his uncles. The secondkind of relationshipis thatof theeiriki,anin-law of one’s own generation with whomintercourseisgenerallypermissible.Thus aman can have intercoursewith his sisters-in-lawand awoman with her brothers-in-law.74TheMarshallIslandsThe customsand religionof the MarshallIslandshave also beendescribedby Frazer,again using nineteenthand early-twentieth-centurysources.He notesthat the islanderswere dividedinto chiefsandcommoners:childrentook the rank of their mother.Chiefscould haveintercoursewith their subjects’ wives and daughters,and had the right todeflowerall virgins.Marriagebetweencross-cousins(childrenof abrotherand sister)was encouraged,but marriagebetweenother cousinswas forbidden.Men were allowedto have intercoursewith their brothers’wives and wives’sisters.They had to marryoutsidetheir clans, whichwere designatedby totems, usuallyanimalsor plants.In some familiesbrother–sister incest was permitted.75The MarshallIslandersbelievedthat after burialthe soul stayedwiththe body for six days.(Six was their holy number,becauseon the reefroundthe islands the wavescame in groupsof six small ones betweeneach pair of three big ones.)Then the soul travelled to the Islandof the140ANCIENTRELIGIONSOF THEAUSTRONESIANWORLD"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Dead,in the form of acanoe: if it was alarge canoe it wouldgo on livingthere, but if it was asmall one it wouldsoon die.

He reportsthat the‘indecent’dancingwith whichwomenjoinedin the receptiongiven toenemies’bodieswas followedby the loosening of all social restrictions:‘sexuallicencehad full rein in open day’.

For the Biaks one is the ‘soul’,the other the‘shadow’.Someof the Yabem, likemany peoples,say that one is theshadow,the other reflection.The Tami maintainthat the ‘long’ soul isthe shadow,while the ‘short’soul goes to the underworld.
