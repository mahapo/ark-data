Theanalysis comprises the more interesting groups of depictions, located on thecoast of Lake Onega on Cape Peri Nos III, and on the northern Cape of BesovNos, in Old Zalavruga by the White Sea, in the river basin of the Lena River inCentral Siberia and elsewhere. A conclusion is reached that due to the fading ofthe contents of the myth and the specifics of rock art it is difficult, if not impos-sible, to prove the relevant connection. Therefore, it might be concluded that inthe written materials many motifs of rock art have too easily been associatedwith the Cosmic Hunt myth.Key words: Cosmic Hunt myth, Far East, Karelia, Mongolia, prehistoric reli-gion, rock art, SiberiaThe images of the Cosmic Hunt are relatively widespread within Northernand Central Eurasian, as well as American, peoples (Berezkin 2005: 109). Thereflections of the discussed heavenly myth have also been suggested on sev-eral rocks in Northern Eurasia. The researchers of rock art have defined themyth in question differently. For example, M. Khlobystina (1971: 172) distin-guishes two versions of the myth. In one case, a certain elemental force (atfirst in a zoomorphic, later in anthropomorphic form) pursues another elementalforce, and in the other situation a certain monster is constantly hunting theSun or the stars. In the extensively detailed book about Russian rock art theresearchers, from Moscow, Ekaterina & Marianna Devlet, treat the first ver-sion in the chapter with the title “Cosmic pursuit” («Êîñìè÷åñêàÿ ïîãîíÿ»), theother version in the chapter named “Heavenly hunter” («Íåáåñíûé ñòðåëîê»;cf. Devlet & Devlet 2005: 116ff & 124ff), without clearly distinguishing theconcept ‘cosmic hunt’ (êîñìè÷åñêàÿ îõîòà) which is, however, used in both cases.In the case of cosmic pursuit a certain animal, which epitomizes the ever-lasting darkness of the underworld, chases after and tries to destroy the sourceof light, the Sun. This might suggest either the alternating of day and night, or http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol44/ernits.pdf"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"62 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreEnn Ernitsa solar eclipse. The Devlets describe two motifs: in one case a circular sun (asa solar symbol) is depicted, and in the other case, an elk-shaped astral body.The first motif can also be found in Siberian rock art where the animal de-picted in West Siberia, in the vicinity of the Tom River is obviously a bear,whereas, towards the East the image is more of a dragon-shape, similar toChinese mythology (Fig. 1 & Fig. 2). In these instances an animal figure inprofile can be seen on the rock, with a circular disc or a circle around itsmuzzle in the majority of cases, or, infrequently, a star.According to the Devlets, the subject matter of the ‘heavenly hunter’ com-prises prehistoric tales and pictures in which 1) the Sami thunder god, fea-tured as a giant hunter, chases the Sun – depicted as a rushing reindeer withgolden horns (for further, see Ernits 1999: 37ff), 2) a hunter (culture hero)chases a predator who tries to catch a sun elk, and 3) a hunter (culture hero)kills several suns that concurrently shine in the sky and ravage the earth. Inthe current study, the Cosmic Hunt is treated solely as the second option sug-gested by the Devlets (Stith Thompsons folklore catalogue F59.2; see Berezkin2005).A serious problem in the research is whether, in rock art, it is possible toidentify myths at all considering the relatively scarce data, and if yes, withwhat likelihood. The reason being the blurring and further development ofancient myths in the course of millennia, wherefore in rock art it mostly re-mains unclear as to who or what is depicted on a certain image. For example,the elk was an especially important animal in the Eurasian forest zone, both inthe economic and cultural sense. The relevant plots, associated with the elk inrock art, have been divided into the following groups: 1) scenes connected withbiology and behaviour of the animal (rut, the birth of an elk calf, migrations),2) hunting scenes and 3) religious scenes (Markdorf 1998: 43–44). On the basisof the North Eurasian myth remains it is difficult to determine whether acertain elk figure marks the Earth, Sun, some constellation, theriomorphicFigure 2.

Mazin is situated in the Far East by the MaiaRiver, the tributary of the Aldan River, and appears as a Late Stone Age ochredrawing. In the scene we can see an archer following an elk who has a face-shaped Sun, with surrounding beams, under its stomach (Fig. 3). On this occa-sion the speculation of the heavenly hunt is more likely than in many othercases, as the composition is complete: it has the hunter, the Sun and the elkand it is located in the area where the relevant myth is known. However, itshould be borne in mind that in the scene in question the image of the Sun, orheliomorph, is secondary, i.e. later than the other figures (Okladnikov & MazinFigure 3. Maia scene (Central Siberia). Okladnikov & Mazin 1979: 141."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"64 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreEnn Ernits1979: 63). There are two possible explanations for this: whether the elk wasconsidered a cosmic creature even without the heliomorph, or the animal be-came a heavenly or Sun elk secondarily.The Komi ethnologist Nikolai Konakov has compared the Maia scene withthe striped elk figures on Uralic rocks with the symbols of celestial bodiesappearing as concentric circles in the vicinity (cit: Devlet & Devlet 2005: 128,see also 118). However, a direct link between the two groups of petroglyphscannot be proved, since the characteristics of hunting are missing in the Uralicrock art.Byrka sceneAnother depiction described by A. Mazin is situ-ated in the upper reaches of the River Amur, atthe find place of Byrka. At first the hindquartersof a mammal have been drawn on the rock withochre, and a face-shaped heliomorph, with beamstouching the stomach of the animal has beenadded later, with a circle with four straight lines(reminiscent of the solar signs of Lake Onega) andanother heliomorph in its vicinity (Fig. 4). An anthro-pomorph, depicted in a traditional style, is in contactwith the latter. A. Mazin (1986: 139, 240) suggests thatwe are dealing with the reflection of the Cosmic Hunt whereasthe anthropomorph could symbolize either the hunter Mani(more often Main in literature) who, according to the Evenkversion of the myth, brings the hard-fought Sun back to thepeople. In the opinion of the current author the considering of the Byrka sceneas an indication of the cosmic myth is quite questionable, since nothing refersto either the pursuit or hunt.Other North Asian scenesIn Siberia, the depictions dated to the Bronze Age Okunevo Culture have beenpreserved where the pursuer incorporates a wolf-like creature with the headof a bear (?) and the legs of a bird. It chases the Sun, depicted as a bull, headingtowards the West, which, according to the researcher, is referred to by solarsigns associated with the image of the animal. They are surrounded by bullhorns. Sometimes only one horn is connected with the Sun (Khlobystina 1971:173).Figure 4.

According to the researcher of rock art EleonoraNovgorodova (1989: 171–172) they represent the species of Cervidae who snatchthe Sun and, in the course of time, may become horned monsters. This inter-pretation might not be accurate since we might be dealing with an elk-shapedSun, i.e. the Sun elk or even somebody else. Indeed, J. & M. Devlet (2005:163ff) treat the horned creatures of Sun separately from the topic of the Cos-mic Hunt.E. Novgorodova (1989: 171) has considered another Bronze Age scene inMongolia, in Arkhangai Aimak, as a representation of the Cosmic Hunt, sup-posedly depicting hunters aiming at the Sun and killing a species of Cervidae.Unfortunately, the named publication lacks a reference and therefore the presentauthor cannot comment on the scene.KARELIAN SCENESThe Neolithic engravings by Lake Onega, which appear in contact with theengravings depicting a celestial body, might be considered heavenly creatures(e.g. a single elk image of Cape Karitski and Cape Peri Nos VI, an animal-headed anthropomorph of Cape Peri Nos III) but these can hardly be con-nected with a definite myth. A scene on Cape Peri Nos might be consideredone of the more plausible representations of the Cosmic Hunt myth, whereasthe connection, of the scene on Cape Besov Nos with the myth, is more un-likely.Peri sceneThe current author considers the composition on Cape Peri Nos III by LakeOnega (see Fig. 5 on p. 66) as one of the most likely representations of themyth in question. However, there are also plenty of problems here. A seriouschallenge is the identification of the four-legged creature depicted from above.The interpretations of the being have been very different so far. Indeed, allresearchers have agreed that we are dealing with a hunting scene. Accordingto the writer and rock art researcher Aleksandr Linevskii (1939: 98) the com-position under discussion depicts the springtime elk hunt with the help of anaxe (!) and a pregnant dog. We should remember at this point that the authorregarded rock art as an almost one-to-one representation of the real life ofancient man.

Laushkin (1962: 250ff), stated thatthe axe was never used while elk hunting, and that the four-legged creaturewas too big, in comparison with an elk; instead, he identified the animal as atail-less frog. Yet in this case it would be necessary to find an explanation as towhy one of the anthropomorphs’ rear legs is considerably shorter and fatterthan the other. The researcher interpreted the whole scene as “the crime andpunishment of an evil frog”. He used one of the Sami etiological myths in hisinterpretation, according to which an evil frog, using a magic axe (!) would killan elk-shaped sun every night. The hunter would thereafter slaughter the frogand dump its body in the fire. According to the researcher the earthly hyposta-sis of the Sun is depicted on the rock by a circle engraved slightly away fromother petroglyphs. In the opinion of K. Laushkin, the scene involves benevo-lent cosmic forces, i.e. the victory of light over darkness and evil or, in otherwords the cosmic hunt. However, the proof material is not always appropriate,though connected with the celestial sphere (see Laushkin 1962: 256–258, 260).In our opinion the scientist is generally on the right path yet we are not deal-ing with a frog, but...A zoologist from Petroskoi, Petr Danilov (1976: 113ff), regarded the figureunder discussion as a beaver, and finally the Karelian rock art researcher YuriSavvateev agreed with him, although Savvateev hesitated for years whetherto consider the depiction a lizard or a frog, being influenced by his forerunners,or instead, a beaver (cf. Savvateev 1980: 149; 1983: 87 and Sawwatejev 1984:87). In the opinion of the author of the current article, we are indeed dealingFigure 5. Peri scene.

It should be added at this point that thearchaeologist Natalia Chlenova (1989: 235) regards the Khanty beaver fratriaor the property marks of the sir social group similar to the beaver images ofLake Onega; likewise, the flint figurines found from the Volga area should beadded to this list. The beaver-like image of Cape Peri Nos III is not the onlyone among its kind. There are four beaver figures known among the petroglyphsof Lake Onega (Savvateev 1980: 141, 149–154): two on Cape Peri Nos III andone on the northern and western Cape of Besov Nos, yet the figures in theselocations do not constitute any composition with other engravings.The tail of the beaver constitutes a uniform whole with the rear limb of thefigure with male characteristics. This allows suggesting a totemic connection.The combination of man and beaver can refer to a human beaver, totemicancestor, a totemic hero descending from the beaver fratria. The connectionwith the rear limb seems to provide the key for understanding the associationin several languages, incl. Estonian, between the words põlvnema ‘descend’,põlv ‘knee’ and sugupõlv ‘generation’ (cf. also Latin genus ‘põlv’ ‘knee’ andgeneratio ‘põlvkond’ ‘generation’). K. Laushkin (1962: 252) considered it anunlikely possibility that the ancient artist had depicted the man’s leg and theanimal’s tail as one piece, yet there are actually more combined depictions inthe rock art of Lake Onega. Thus, in the northern part of the relevant area ofdistribution, we can see four combined engravings on Cape Swan and two inthe mouth of the River Vodla, comprising the combined body parts of the im-ages of an elk and a water bird (Fig. 6). In one of these cases the foreleg of theelk simultaneously forms the neck of the bird, and a part of the stomach in theother case (Poikalainen & Ernits 1998: 95, 125, 173, 262, 293, 333). At thispoint, the present author has suggested the representation of the combinedtotem of the swan and elk fratrias (Ernits 1992: 117, 122). Suchan interpretation does not allow considering the four-leg-ged creature from Cape Peri NosIII as an enemy, as suggested byK. Laushkin. The fact that thebeaver has not been engraved intothe rock in profile, as the swan andelk depictions, but from above, hasbeen conditioned by the fact that pre-historic people were apparentlyFigure 6.

Numerous amulets demonstrate that this mam-mal species has played an important role in prehistoric beliefs. Stone Age figu-rines have been found from Finland, Estonia, Lithuania and elsewhere. Thebeaver cult was widespread among the Finno-Ugrians back then (Chlenova1989). The connection by means of the tail might indeed refer to the signifi-cance of the beaver’s tail. Namely, under their tales beavers have their scentglands where valuable secretion is produced. Whether the secretion was ofany value already during the Neolithic period is unknown since the first recordsabout using the secretion originate from Herodotus from the 5th century BC(Schrader 1917–1923: 139).The anthropomorphic creature has been depicted very schematically (al-most as a cross) wherefore nothing can really be said about its actions. Onlythe weapon in the “air” allows suggesting that it has “recently” been thrown.Unfortunately, a beaver-shaped culture hero is not familiar from the Balto-Finnic mythology. The reason might be that the prehistoric hunters’ religiongave grounds for the farmers’ religion. The weapon of the supposed hunter –the club (nui) – is also a problem. There is no data about the ancient BalticFinns having used this weapon, although the word itself is of general Balto-Finnic origin or supposedly dates back even to the Mari or Permian languages(SSA 1995: 235; cf. Finnish nuija). Commonly in myths the bow and arrowshave been mentioned as the weapons of the Cosmic Hunt.Which celestial body might be hidden behind the human beaver is abso-lutely not certain since the relevant Balto-Finnic myth has been preservedonly in remnants. A similarly confusing case appears with the elk figure thehead of which is turned to the west. What does it symbolize? On the basis ofSiberian data, I have, in my earlier writings, related the figure to the UrsaMajor rushing towards the west at sunset. Back then no Eastern Europeandata was known. However, the above-said can, to some extent, be verified withthe help of the magnificent myth catalogue compiled by the researcher of thepast, Yuri Berezkin from St. Petersburg (Berezkin 2008).1In Eastern Europe, Ursa Major has been depicted as an elk by the Sami,Mari, and extensively also by the Northern and Central European Russianswho have apparently acquired this image from Finno-Ugrians. However, wehardly have any information whether in Europe the elk has altogether beenconsidered the object of the Cosmic Hunt. The scarce evidence of this might bethe tale of the Finns and Karelians about an unfortunate hunt for a giant elkHiisi who later became Ursa Major. Yet, in this particular instance and in the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 4469On the Cosmic Hunt in North Eurasian Rock Artcase of the following stories it is not absolutely sure whether we are dealingspecifically with the hunt, the purpose of which was to arrange the actions ofthe Sun (see also Hautala 1947: 213–218).Secondly, the Mari image should be mentioned according to which UrsaMajor symbolizes an elk with calves and a hunter with a dog. The hunter isforced to forever circle on the vault of heaven because of killing the elks. It ispossible that the cosmogonic myth has become etiological. Vague traces of themyth in question can be found among the Komi-Zyrians and the Chuvash peo-ple (the latter are the Finno-Ugrians who have changed their language). As weknow, these stories have gradually become relatively obscure in content. Thus,it can only be cautiously suggested that the myth, where the elk was the objectof the Cosmic Hunt, was formerly known by the Balto-Finnic people.On the other hand, let us recall that according to the data by Castrén, inSami mythology, the son of the Sun’s daughter, Kalla parneh, representingOrion, with Ursa Major as a bow in his hand, pursued Cassiopeia which movedlike an elk. In addition to the Sami, a similar story is known, as an arcticversion of the Cosmic Hunt, among the Northeast Asian and North Americanpeoples, which, according to the data of Y. Berezkin, refers to circumpolarconnections (Berezkin 2005: 116–117, 119). This also shows that there are morevariants besides the hunt for the Sun. The circular engraving which, in theopinion of K. Laushkin, depicted a fire in the composition of Peri, was previ-ously considered the Moon by the present author, however, taking into ac-count the myth as a whole, we might rather be dealing with the Sun. Theconnection with a solar symbol was suggested also by K. Laushkin (1962: 254).Figure 7. Besov Nos scene (Karelia). Ravdonikas 1936: Plate 22."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"70 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreEnn ErnitsBesov Nos sceneCould the Cosmic Hunt myth be represented by one composition on the north-ern Cape of Besov Nos on the cliff of Lake Onega (Fig. 7)? According to V. Ravdo-nikas (1936: 84–85) the composition depicts a profile of an anthropomorph witha tail, wearing an animal mask, with a lunar and a solar sign in his hand,riding on a snake and chasing a species of Cervidae, probably an elk. The headof the elk is turned towards the west, similarly to the image on Cape Peri NosIII. At this point it should be mentioned that a typologically similar (totemic?)anthropomorphic creature, depicted in profile and wearing an animal mask,with one cosmic sign in its hand, another near its rear limb and the thirdahead of it, can be found on Cape Peri Nos VI (see Ravdonikas 1936: 79). Thiscomparison has already been referred to by K. Laushkin (1959: 97). In anycase, the latter composition does not represent the Cosmic Hunt myth.At first V. Ravdonikas was ambiguous with regard to the species of theanimal with a mask, specifying later that it was an anthropomorphic creaturedisguised as a bear (Ravdonikas 1937: 18). According to the researcher there isa certain benevolent totemic hero depicted on the rock, the protector of theclan or a tribe. V. Ravdonikas considered the fight of the two opposite particles(light and darkness, goodness and evilness, warmth and coldness) as the cen-tral idea of the scene. This suggestion, too distant from the matter, rightlycalled forth a somewhat ironic remark from A. Linevskii:While looking at this figure I find it difficult to ascribe such a complicatedmythology to the artist of the petroglyphs. This is undoubtedly a mytho-logical creature but there is hardly any data for making conclusions aboutits fight with darkness (?) and evilness. (Linevskii 1939: 28)Thus even A. Linevskii who usually looked for a rationalist origin in rock art,considered the anthropomorph a mythical character. However, the petroglyphs,interpreted as cosmic symbols by V. Ravdonikas, were continuously regardedas different kinds of traps by Linevskii. K. Laushkin (1959: 102), on the otherhand, interpreted the scene under discussion as a symbolic offering to the Sun,whereas the offerer was a totemic ancestor who had taken light from the Sunand the Moon (in the form of the symbols of celestial bodies) and used this tohelp to combat spring-time famine and misery. In this case the reindeer wouldsymbolize the victim.K. Laushkin is convinced that the wavy line on the edge of the rock fissuredoes not represent a snake but a ski, and instead of the supposed tail theanthropomorph carries some sort of hunting requisite. Without mentioningthe thoughts of Laushkin on this issue, Y. Savvateev (1983: 59) also considered"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 4471On the Cosmic Hunt in North Eurasian Rock Artthese a ski and a hunting instrument, or a weapon. According to him thediscussed composition might also include a lunar symbol, above the anthropo-morph and the elk, and another elk with its head downwards. In the sameplace the scientist admits that he had been earlier mistaken when he inter-preted the scene in the same way as A. Linevskii. If we really are dealing with the scene of the Cosmic Hunt, the zooanthropo-morph apparently uses skis which do appear in the myth stories of both theFinno-Ugric as well as other Nordic peoples. There are no more skiers amongthe petroglyphs of Lake Onega, however, they can be found among the depic-tions of the White Sea rock art.By reason of partial similarity the mentioned scene of Lake Onega hasbeen compared to a Stone Age scene of a skier in Rødøy in Nordland County,Norway. According to Nils Lid the anthropomorphic figure with horns couldhold the same item as is visible on the petroglyph of Lake Onega. At this pointN. Lid suggested that both the Lake Onega, as well as the Rødøy skier, havebeen depicted with the remedy necessary for a shaman’s trip to the under-world – the drum(s) (Lid 1956: 276, 282). The petroglyph of Nordland is notconnected with a species of Cervidae. A skier, with a stick in his one hand, anda circular item in the other, is also depicted on a petroglyph discovered nearthe Tom River in West Siberia (Okladnikov & Martynov 1972: 60).The anthropomorph of Lake Onega is either wearing a mask or is a halfhuman-half animal – a totemic creature, half predator. By the way, accordingto N. Lid (1956: 279), it is a wolf. It is not clear as to what does the elk stand for,since the celestial bodies (either the Moon or Sun?) are in the hero’s hand. Didthe hero get hold of these from their abductor, i.e. the elk? Provided we arereally dealing with the Cosmic Hunt, it represents a totally different style andprobably a different era.Five researchers and five different interpretations! There is no principaldifference whether a totemic ancestor or a certain hero has been depicted onthe rock. Unfortunately, there is no sign of the activity of the anthropomorphon the rock. This enables offering completely different interpretations. Themajority of the researchers are a priori of the opinion that the ancient artisthas depicted a hunting scene. However, hunt with snares has to be abandoned,since the numerous cosmic signs of various forms are at present no longerconsidered snares. Likewise, it is hardly believable that there are hundreds ofdepictions of shaman drums on the rock. Copious cosmic symbols have beenreferred to quite convincingly, although hardly with a 100 per cent probability.Therefore, the representation of cosmic myths on the rocks of Lake Onega israther likely. The scene under discussion has some typological similaritieswith the sites of the above described rock art of the Okunevo Culture."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"72 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreEnn ErnitsOld Zalavruga sceneThe petroglyphs of the White Sea are significantly different from the LakeOnega depictions. The Devlets (2005: 133) have placed one scene, from themiddle group of paintings in Old Zalavruga (Fig. 8), under the chapter “Heav-enly hunter”. According to the description by V. Ravdonikas (1938: 33, 35) thepicture depicts a skier, attached to a high-antlered reindeer in front of him viaa certain oblong artefact (a stick?). Similarly to the Lake Onega petroglyphsthe animal is depicted with its muzzle turned towards the west. The scenecould be interpreted as a representation of a cosmic myth only in the casewhere the small circle above the antler truly depicts a celestial body resp. theSun. However, we cannot be sure of this. A similar skier (with a fragmentarybow?) and a reindeer with its head turned to the west are located in the vicin-ity. An interesting aspect is that the compositions are linked together by achain of circles, short lines and irregular minute figures which might refer tothe conceptual association of both scenes.IN CONCLUSIONIn the literature on rock art some scenes are far too easily regarded as therepresentations of the Cosmic Hunt. It should be admitted that there is hardlyany ground to associate the scenes depicting elk or deer hunting with theCosmic Hunt myth whereby there is no visible connection with the luminar-ies, and even more so if we are dealing with figures of archers on foot or onFigure 8.

Likewise, it difficult to prove the Cosmic Huntmyth in petroglyphs where the respective attributes or hunting elements can-not be seen. The suggestion of the relevant theme is inhibited by the fact thatthe rock depictions are excessively schematic and do not allow unambiguousidentification. In some cases it is possible to show that we are dealing withmyths associated with celestial bodies, but which of these, remains unclear.The establishing of the relevant connection is more complicated as the mythshave been fading in the course of time. Thus, it can be very cautiously sug-gested that from among the above discussed compositions it is the scene ofCape Peri Nos III by Lake Onega, and the one at the Maia River in CentralSiberia that seem to be the most certain representations of the Cosmic Hunt.Despite thumbing through numerous reference sources, the present au-thor has found no information about the possible representations of the cosmicmyth in Finnish and Scandinavian rock art. For example, among the numer-ous petroglyphs of Central Sweden, that depict a species of Cervidae, there isonly one elk figure struck through with a (big) spear, although there is nohunter depicted in the vicinity (Forsberg 2000: 73). As becomes evident fromthe above-described, it is very difficult to prove the presence of a cosmic mythin rock art. While continuing the relevant research the possible thematic com-positions of the whole world should be analyzed in great detail. But can they befound elsewhere?NOTES1 At this point I am indebted to Andres Kuperjanov who drew my attention to thispublication.REFERENCESBerezkin, Juri 2005. Kosmiline jaht.
