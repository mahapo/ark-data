The Pleiades in the Eastern Baltic are ‘a sieve’, the Milky Way is ‘thepath of migratory birds’ and a girl holding water pails is seen on the Moon.Across most of Central, Western and Southern Europe the Pleiades are ‘a henwith its chicken’, the Milky Way and the lunar spots have other (and different)interpretations. The Eastern Baltic pattern is identical with the Middle Volgaone where it is widespread among both Finnish-Permian and Turkic groups andprobably relates back to the (Proto-Baltic?) culture of the Iron Age. However,parallels for the cosmonyms in question are found across most of NorthernEurasia and find corresponding similarities in some parts of North America.‘Water-carrier on the Moon’ is the most widespread of these motifs being knownin Japan and Polynesia. In Eurasia, the Northern Samoyeds noticeably lack allthree images. The initial emergence of at least some of the cosmonyms underdiscussion in the Terminal Pleistocene of northern East Asia and their furtherdissemination towards the West, down to the Baltics, is a hypothesis to bechecked.Key words: Asian-American cosmonymic links, folk astronomy, lunar spots,prehistory of Northern Eurasia, the Milky Way, the PleiadesSeven objects in the night sky attracted attention in Eurasian cultures outsidethe Tropical Zone. These are the Moon with dark spots on its disc, Venus, theMilky Way, the Big Dipper, the Pleiades, the Belt of Orion, and Polaris. Otherplanets, stars and constellations were also singled out by some cultures, yetignored by others. Though the number of Eurasian cosmonyms is great, mostof them are either rare or are mere variants of a few dominant ways of inter-pretation. The conservatism of cosmological vocabulary and of mythopoeticideas which underlie it makes them a good source of data on the past’s ethno-cultural development.The cosmonymic map of Europe lets us infer that this past may have beenrather distant.

In particular, cosmonymic vocabularies of the Balts and the BalticFinns are identical even though the languages of these peoples belong to twounrelated families. Everywhere in the Eastern Baltic the Milky Way is the‘path of (migratory) birds’, the Pleiades are a ‘sieve’, and a girl with pails in herhands is seen on the Moon. However, everywhere to the south and west of theBaltic Sea, excluding those areas of Poland and Belorussia where Baltic lan-guages were relatively recently replaced by Slavic languages (Gładyszowa 1960;Niebrzegowska 1999: 149; Vaiškūnas 2004: 169–170), the Eastern Baltic-typecosmonymy is absent and exceptions are few. The ‘path of birds’ is known tothe Lusitanian Sorbians (Azimov & Tolstoi 1995: 118); the interpretation of thePleiades as a sieve was recorded among Hungarians (Mándoki 1963: 519–520;Zsigmond 2003: 434) and in a few cases among Italians (Volpati 1932: 206;1933b: 21); and ‘girl on the Moon’ is typical for Macedonia and North-EasternBulgaria, with a few cases in Romania (Marinov 2003: 28; Mladenova 2006:137, 263–264, map 29; Tsenev 2004: 47).Despite the exceptions mentioned, there is clearly a basic cosmonymic bor-der between the Balts and the Slavs. The absence of such a border betweenBalts and Baltic Finns is also not subject to doubt. What historical processescould produce such a boundary?THE PLEIADES AS OPENINGS IN THE SKYWe begin with the Pleiades. Putting aside the association of the Pleiades witha group of people (images of this sort are recorded in various areas but arevery different from each other), three basic variants are widespread in Europe(Fig. 1. Numbers: 1 ‘hen with chickens’, 2 ‘wild duck’s nest’, and 3 ‘sieve’).The cosmonym ‘hen with its chickens’, ‘brood’, ‘chickens’, ‘pullets’ and thelike are typical for Western, Southern and Central Europe, the Balkans, andWestern Ukraine (Andree 1878: 106; Boneva 1994: 12; Chubinskii 1872: 14;Janković 1951: 141; Krappe 1938: 152; László 1975: 604; Matičetov 1974: 49;Mladenova 2006: 89–93; Niebrzegowska 1999: 145; Smith 1925: 124; Sviatski1961: 120; Volpati 1932: 194–205; 1933a: 507). Inside this zone, they are onlyabsent across most of the territory of the former Yugoslavia and among thepeoples of the Pyrenees (other than the Basques, who do have this). OutsideEurope, ‘hen with its chickens’ is typical for West Africa and the Sudan (Hirsch-berg 1929: 326–327; Meek 1931: 200; Schwab 1947: 413; Spieth 1906: 557; Volpati1933a: 507), for North-East India, and for South-East Asia (Andree 1878; Smith1925: 114; Vathanaprida 1994: 39–41)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 449The Pleiades as Openings, The Milky Way as the Path of Birds, and The Girl On the MoonIt is possible that in the past the same cosmonym was known in the Near Eastand North Africa (Volpati 1932: 195), though now the Persian-Arabic Soraya(‘chandelier’, i.e. a cluster of lamps) is the only word that is used for the Pleiades.The Touaregs call the Pleiades ‘chickens’ (Rodd 1926: 226). Because this cosmo-nym is lacking in ancient sources which are abundant at least for Italy (Volpati1933a) and because it is connected only with the domestic hen, we can suggesta relatively late spread into Europe.Cosmonyms that mean ‘nest (or an egg, eggs) of a wild duck’, or ‘a flock ofducks’ are typical for the Nenets (Khomich 1974: 232), Komi-Zyrians (Sviatski1961: 120), Udmurts (Wichmann 1987: 214, 273), as well as for the Ob’ Ugrians(Munkácsi 1908: 255; 1996; Steinitz 1966–1993: 1412, 1636). In Siberia and inNortheast Europe, a coincidence of this cosmonym with Uralic languages isnoticeable, although there are a number of exceptions. Among the Selkup, thePleiades are ‘hare’s shelves’ or ‘hare’s droppings’ (Tuchkova 2004: 212). Themeaning of this name has been lost, and no parallels in other traditions areknown. Among the Nganasans, the Pleiades are hunters who catch the soulsof dead men and reindeer (Popov 1984: 48). The Enets name Kondiku (Dolgikh1961: 24) either has no Samoyed etymology or else was greatly distorted whenFigure 1. Major variants of the folk-names for the Pleiades in Europe: 1. Hen and chickens;2. Brood or nest of (wild) ducks; 3.

On the other hand, among the Khakas, whospeak a Turkic language, the Pleiades are also ‘a duck’s nest’ or ‘a flock ofducks’ (Butanaev 1975: 238). The predominant position of the ‘duck’s nest’among northern Russians (Potanin 1883: 730; Rut 1976: 15) is a clear legacy ofthe pre-Slavic sub-stratum. Moving to the east of the Urals, the Russians broughtthe ‘duck’s nest’ to Siberia. Citing Uno Harva, some authors claimed the exist-ence of such an image among the Yakuts and the Kamchadals (Lundmark1982: 105; Mladenova 2006: 196), but these statements result from a misun-derstanding: Harva mistook the Russian cosmonym ‘duck’s nest’ for a transla-tion of the Pleiades’ name from native languages (Harva 1933: 135). Maria Rutseems to have made a similar mistake discussing Enets’ materials (Rut 1987: 47).A continuous and compact area of the ‘duck’s nest’, that is basically locatedinside the territory of the former spread of Uralic languages but crosses thelanguage borders of both the Samoyeds and the Finno-Ugrians, allows us tosuggest a connection of this cosmonym with some extinct people. If this peoplespoke a language of the Uralic family, no direct language descendents remainedfrom this grouping.The designation of the Pleiades as a ‘sieve’ is characteristic, as was men-tioned, for the Eastern Baltic where it was recorded among ancient Prussians,Lithuanians, Letts, Livonians, Estonians, Votians, Finns (Allen 1899: 397;Andree 1878: 107; Ernits & Ernits 2009; Kerbelyte 2001: 65; Kuperjanov 2003:183–185; Mándoki 1963: 519; Nepokupny 2004; Vaiškūnas 1999: 167; 2004: 169).There are no data on the Vepses while for the Saami the Pleiades are girls(Charnoluski 1930: 48; Lundmark 1982: 105). In the Middle Volga region ‘sieve’,as a name for the Pleiades, has been recorded among the Chuvash (Mándoki1963: 520; Sirotkin & Ivanov 1970: 128; Iukhma 1980: 266; Zolotnitskii 1874:22), Mari (Aktsorin 1991, No. 37: 83), Tatars (Potanin 1883: 729; Vorobiev &Khisamutdinov 1967: 316), Bashkirs (Maksiutova 1973: 383), and Udmurts (prob-ably the southern groups only) (Nikonov 1973: 376; Wichmann 1987: 107). Inthe Volga region, the Mordvinians are the only exception, the Pleiades beingfor them a ‘beehive’ (Sviatski 1961: 121). Such an interpretation or variants,which are more or less similar to it (‘apiary’, ‘nest of wasps’), are also knownto Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, and Hungarians (Mladenova 2006: 115).Among Russians, ‘sieve’, as a name for the Pleiades, has been recorded inVologda Province and among Russian migrants in areas beyond the westernborder of Russian ethnic territory (Rut 1987: 15; Sviatski 1961: 121).Besides the Eastern Baltic and Middle Volga areas, ‘sieve’ is typical for Dage-stan where it is recorded among the Kumyks, Laks, Avars, Andi, Dargins, andTavli (Gamzatov & Dalgat 1991: 304–305; Potanin 1883: 729–730). Grigori Pota-nin found ‘sieve’ as a name for the Pleiades among the Kazakh of the Middle"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 4411The Pleiades as Openings, The Milky Way as the Path of Birds, and The Girl On the MoonZhuz and among Astrakhan Tatars (Potanin 1881: 126; 1919: 84). A suggestedPersian parallel (Nepokupny 2004: 80) is wrong: words Parvin (‘the Pleiades’,from the ‘first’) and parvizan (‘sieve’) do not share the same root (Steblin-Kamenski 2008). Among Chukchi and Koryak of the Asian North-East, W. Bogo-ras and W. Jochelson recorded cosmonyms Ke’tmet and Kä’tmäc (Bogoras 1939:29; Jochelson 1908: 122) and translated them as ‘small sieve’, though at leastamong the Chukchi the basic image of the Pleiades was ‘group of women’ (Bogo-ras 1939: 24). A word similar to Ketmet really means ‘sieve’ (for washing salmonroe) though not in the Paleoasiatic but in the Yukaghir language (Mudrak2008).There are two basic, compact and large, areas for the Pleiades as ‘sieve’,the Eastern Baltic and the Middle Volga. Historically, they have in common aBaltic sub-stratum or Baltic influence (Napolskikh 1997: 158–161), and theBattle-Axe and Corded Ware cultures spread there in the earlier period (I donot here address the question whether there was a continuity between thebearers of these archaeological cultures and the proto-Balts). Later in the Volgaregion this cosmonym was transmitted from Finno-Ugrians to Turkic peoples.‘Sieve’ may have reached Dagestan and Kazakhstan from the Volga regionin times of the Golden Horde (Napolskikh’s suggestion) though such a latediffuse spreading does not fit well a specific parallel between the Lithuaniansand the Laks: the sky sieve was used by God to winnow cereal grains (Khalidova1984: 160; Nepokupny 2004: 77). Unfortunately, the Lithuanian mytheme isknown only from a literary source (Mickiewicz 1955, book 8: 434), from whichit is not sufficient to draw reliable conclusions. The position of Hungarianmaterials is also unclear as although the Hungarian word szita for the Pleiadesis borrowed from Slavic (Mándoki 1963: 519–520), the constellation in the skyis really viewed as something with openings (Zsigmond 2003: 434). The factthat the Hungarians are the only people in the Balkans who have this conceptmakes it doubtful that such an interpretation of the Pleiades was borrowedfrom the Slavic population of Pannonia. And if the Hungarians brought it fromthe East, what was the source? In Western Europe the cosmonym ‘sieve’ (cri-vello) is recorded only in the Alto Adige district of Northern Italy (Volpati 1932:206; 1933b: 21). It deserves to be mentioned that crivello is both ‘sieve’ and‘shovel for winnowing grain’.To sum up, the origins of ‘sieve’ as a designation of the Pleiades in Europeis far from obvious as it is not clear that all versions had a single source. But ifwe look at the names of the star objects in the pan-Eurasian perspective, thegiven cosmonym can be interpreted as a particular case of a more general andmore widely known image, i.e. the conception of stars as openings."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"12 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri BerezkinThere are Siberian parallels for this and not only the Paleoasiatic onesmentioned above. The etymology of the name of the Pleiades in Turkic lan-guages (Ulker, Yurker, Yurkar, etc.) is disputable. According to one of the hy-potheses, it is ‘vent’, ‘to pierce’ (Nikonov 1980b: 296). Anna Dybo, the leadingspecialist in Altai languages, does not consider this suggestion as substanti-ated (Dybo 2008). At the same time, it is supported for the Yakuts by a folkloretext: the hero makes mittens of wolf skin to stop up holes in the sky fromwhich the icy wind blows and these holes are the Pleiades (Holmberg 1927:418). Among the Orochi and the Uilta of Sakhalin the Pleiades, in some cases,are also ‘seven openings’ (Podmaskin 2006: 432) though the ‘seven women’ aremore usual for the Lower Amur region. No special narratives exist related tothis name but the same word is used to denote the branchial openings of thelamprey (Pevnov 2008). Beyond Northern Eurasia, the conception of thePleiades as stars surrounding an opening can be found among the CanadianOjibwa (Speck 1915: 48). Given that there exist other Asiatic – North Ameri-can parallels in mythology (Berezkin 2006), the historic connection betweenthis image and the Siberian ideas is not excluded.Figure 2.

Nev-ertheless, the conception of stars as openings is predominant only in NorthernEurasia, in the American Arctic and possibly in Borneo (Fig. 2). As isolatedcases it is recorded among the Estonians (Kuperjanov 2003: 125), Mari (Aktsorin1991, No. 26: 59–60), Komi (Ariste 2005, No. 136: 163) and seems to be a normamong the Nenets (Neniang 1997: 214, 224; Khelimski 1982: 399), Nganasans(Popov 1984: 45; Simchenko 1996: 191), Khanty (Lukina 1990, No. 8: 67–69),Kets (Alekseenko 1976: 79; Dulzon 1966: 15–17; 1972: 83–86), Yakuts (Gurvich1977: 199; Ergis 1967: 134), Evenki (Vasilevich 1959: 161–162; Voskoboinikov1960: 296), Evens (Lamut) (Burykin 2001: 114), and Negidals (Pevnov 2008).Indirect or vague information of a similar nature exists for the Chukchi andKamchadal (Ergis 1974: 134; Jochelson 1961: 71–74). In North America theconcept of stars as openings is typical for the Arctic where it is registeredamong the Central Yupiq, including Nunivak Island, Inupiat, the MackenzieDelta, Caribou, Netsilik and Iglulik Eskimo (Lantis 1946: 197; MacDonald 1998:33; Nelson 1899: 495; Ostermann 1942: 56, 58; 1952: 128; Rasmussen 1930: 79).This fact should be considered in relation to a hypothesis of a separate origin ofthe Eskimo which was different from the origins of other American natives.The image of a particular star (usually Polaris) as an opening through whichone can penetrate into the upper world is known to many American Indians,but the general conception of stars, as holes in the firmament, in North andSouth America is recorded only rarely and among groups isolated from eachother such as Thompson River Salish, Totonac, Tucuna, and Tupari (Boas 1895,No. 4: 17–18; Caspar 1975: 188; Ichon 1969: 36; Nimuendaju 1952: 123–124).An absolute majority of American natives, as well as the peoples of Africa,Australia, Oceania and the Indo-Pacific borderlands of Asia, interpreted starstaken as a particular class of objects in only one way, i.e. as persons, spirits,living creatures of some kind.THE MILKY WAY AS THE ‘PATH OF BIRDS’The second cosmonym whose western limit coincides approximately with theborder between Lithuanians and Poles is the designation of the Milky Way asthe ‘path of birds’ (Fig. 3) or, more precisely, of migratory birds like geese,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri Berezkinducks, swans or cranes. Researchers sometimes see in the ‘path of birds’ avariant of a more general interpretation of the Milky Way as the ‘route of deadsouls’ (Kuperjanov 2001). The two ideas are quite similar in meaning (Azimov& Tolstoi 1995: 118), but the cosmonym ‘path of birds’ is still specific enoughand sometimes coexists as a distinct image with the ‘route of dead souls’ (Aikhen-wald et al. 1982: 164). The area of its spread covers only part of the territorywhere seasonal migrations of birds occur as a particular theme in folkloretraditions. The latter is elaborated e.g. among the native peoples of Alaska,North American Northwest Coast and some South American Indians (Berezkin2007) but ‘path of birds’ is unknown to most of these groups.‘The path of birds’ (‘path of cranes’, ‘birds’ path’, ‘trace of the route of birds’,etc.) is known mainly to peoples from three language families, i.e. Balts, Finno-Ugrians (but excluding Samoyeds) and Turks. These include the Letts andLithuanians (Kerbelyte 2001: 57; Gładyszowa 1960: 77–78; Vaiškūnas 1999: 173),Livonians (Toivonen 1937: 123), Estonians (Pustylnik 2002: 268; Kuperjanov2003: 150–151), Finns (Erdödi 1968: 110–111), Saami (Erdödi 1968: 111; Toivo-nen 1937: 123), Mari (Aktsorin 1991: 55–56; Erdödi 1968: 110; Vasiliev 1907:12), Mordvin (Deviatkina 1998: 118), Chuvash (Ashmarin 1984: 26; RodionovFigure 3.

The same cosmonym was knownalso to the Khanty and Mansi (Erdödi 1968: 109–110; Munkácsi 1908: 254;Napolskikh 1992: 8) and up to the 16th century to the Hungarians (Nikonov1980: 248) who seem to have brought it from their eastern homeland. Anothername for the Milky Way which is widespread among Ob’ Ugrians is ‘ski trace’,connected to the myth about the hunt of the sky elk (Erdödi 1968: 116). It iseither the only or the most dominant name among Samoyeds and the peoplesof Eastern Siberia, Lower Amur and Alaska. Among Ob’ Ugrians both namesare found, but they are connected with different cycles of mythological ideas.Russians call the Milky Way ‘path of geese’ in Vologda, Viatka, Perm, Tula,Smolensk, and Kaluga provinces and in Siberia (Gura 1997: 671; Rut 1987: 13),as do Belorussians in Polesie near Pinsk (Gura 1997: 658), and Ukrainians inVolyn’ near Lutsk (Chubinskii 1872: 15; Moshkov 1900: 205). In Southern Rus-sia, across most of the Ukraine and among Southern Slavs this cosmonym isabsent and thus its geographic spread suggests a borrowing by Slavs from aFinno-Ugric or Baltic sub-stratum, which may ultimately lead us to the sameset of cultures, as does the concept ‘sieve’ applied to the Pleiades. At the sametime, the areal coincidence of ‘sieve’ and ‘path of birds’ is not complete – thespread of the latter cosmonym is wider. It is important to add both Saami andespecially Turks beyond the Volga region, i.e. the Kazakh, Kirgiz, Karakalpakand Turkmen. Nevertheless, not all Turks share this concept. The absence ofthe ‘path of birds’ among peoples of the Sayan-Altai region as well as amongUzbeks (and most probably Uigurs) makes it doubtful that this cosmonym hada proto-Turkic origin.However the ‘path of birds’ is known to the Evenki of the Middle Amur area(Vasilevich 1969: 210) and in America to Algonkians who live to the north ofthe Great Lakes, in particular to the Ojibwa, including two groups near LakeHuron (Miller 1997: 60; Speck 1915: 79) and the Saulteaux (Hallowell 1934:394). It is not clear if the materials of the Tutchone Athabascans, who live inCanada near the border with southern Alaska, are related to the same concep-tion. Among the Southern Tutchone the Milky Way marks the path of the loonwho had cured the blind hunter (McClelland 1975: 78)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri BerezkinTaken as a whole, the distribution of the ‘path of birds’ does not justifyattributing the origin of this cosmonym to Balts or Turks. Finno-Ugrians mostprobably did know the ‘path of birds’ from early times, but the absence of thiscosmonym among Samoyeds makes it unlikely that it can be attributed to theproto-Uralic. From another side, unless it emerged independently among theEvenki and the Algonkians, this concept must have appeared in Eurasia longbefore the split of Proto-Uralic into two major branches.THE WATER-CARRIER ON THE MOONThe third cosmonym whose western limits in Europe coincide approximatelywith the border between Balts and Slavs is the ‘girl with pails on the Moon’(Fig. 4). Two tales including this are widely known. According to one, the Moontakes pity on an orphan girl, a poor step-daughter, or the like, who was sent tofetch water and so the Moon takes her up to herself. According to the other,the Moon does this as punishment for a girl or young woman who was arro-gant and boastful. Since then a figure of a girl with pails can be seen on theFigure 4.

Among Balts and Baltic Finns, in particular the Lithuanians (Kerbelyte2001: 70; Laurinkienė 2002: 365; Vaiškūnas 2006: 158), Letts (Pogodin 1895: 440),Livonians (Loorits 2000: 318), Estonians (Kuperjanov 2003: 72; Peebo & Peegel1989: 282; Jüvä et al. 1995: 94), and Votians (Ariste 1974: 5; 1977: 175; Ernits &Ernits 1984: 579) one or both of these two variants are recorded together withother, more rare, explanations. For example among the Karelians the girlholds in her hands a milk-pail (Evseev 1981: 313). No details of the Vepsian‘legends’ are provided by the source (Egorov 2003: 129).

In the Volga-Permian region the ‘water-carrier on the Moon’ is presentamong Komi-Zyrians (Ariste 2005, No. 109: 105; Limerov 2005, No. 58: 55–56),Komi-Permiaks (Konakov et al. 2003: 312), Udmurts (Potanin 1883: 776;Vereschagin 1995: 85–86; Vladykin 1994: 322), Chuvash (Ashmarin 1984: 25;Denisov 1959: 15–16; Vardugin 1996: 260; Egorov 1994: 120), Mari (Aktsorin1991, No. 37–42: 83–87; Moshkov 1900: 197), Bashkirs (Nadrshina 1985: No. 6,7: 12 13; Rudenko 1955: 315), Volga Tatars (Vorobiev & Khisamutdinov 1967:314–315). In this area, the version with an orphan girl is widely known, whilethe version with the woman who made fun of the Moon is absent. Bashkirs andTatars have the story of the Moon who carried away the girl because he fell inlove with her. As with the ‘sieve’, the Mordvin present an exception – I couldnot find the motif of the ‘water-carrier on the Moon’ in their folklore. AmongRussians the motif of the ‘water-carrier as a poor orphan-girl’ seems to berecorded only in the Viatka Province (Belova 2004, No. 1305: 521), while themotif of a young boy and girl who went after water and were looking at theMoon too intently was recorded in Arkhangelsk Province (Gura 2006: 462).These data concerning northern Russians are hardly exhaustive because thispart of regional cosmonymy has never been the focus of research. The Ukrain-ian ‘water-carrier on the Moon’ was recorded only once, in Volyn’ region (Gura2006: 262), i.e. in the same area where the ‘path of birds’ was also present.Just as was the ‘path of birds’, so ‘the water-carrier on the Moon’ in its ‘poorstep-daughter’ version is present among the Kirgiz (Brudnyi & Eshmambetov1968: 11–13) and the Kazakh. Kazakh materials were recently obtained in AkTüba Province (Stasevich 2006). Previously, Kazakh ideas about the spots onthe Moon were not investigated, so the lack of data on the eastern groups ofKazakh, as well of Karakalpak, is not significant. From the Kirgiz the motif ofa poor step-daughter who was sent to fetch water and was taken up onto theMoon may have spread to the Pamir region, where it is known at least to theVakhan (Lashkarbekov 2005). ‘The water-carrier on the Moon’ (in its two vari-ants ‘poor step-daughter’ and ‘woman of indecent behavior’) is recorded among"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"18 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri BerezkinSiberian Tatars (Valeev 1976: 329; Urazaleev 2007: 4). The motif is neitherknown among the Northern Samoyeds nor among the Northern Selkup. Amongthe Southern Selkup it is a small girl who went to fetch water, or a young girlwho teased the Moon (Golovnev 1995: 330–331; Pelikh 1972: 322–323). Amongthe Khanty it is a small girl (alone or together with a boy) who teased theMoon (Kulemzin & Lukina 1978, No. 4, 5: 15–16) and among the Mansi it is agirl with pails, explanations for this image seem to be lost (Ivanova 2009).Among the Ket the Moon was teased by a young girl or woman (Alekseenko1976: 84). Among the Khakas the same story about a poor step-daughter waswidespread, as also among the Kirgiz, Kazakhs (Butanaev 1975: 232). For theAltai region the motif is not typical. In only one of many narratives that de-scribe how the ogre Tilbegen (Jelbegen, etc.) got to the Moon, the Moon tookhim when he went to fetch water and had a yoke and pails in his hands (Anokhin1997: 5–6). Data on Shor and Tuvin are absent, and among the Tofa, the per-son who ended up on the Moon is an orphan boy sent to fetch water (Rassadin1996, No 3: 10). In a tale of the Darkhats, who live in Mongolia near KhubsugulLake, two boys went after water and ended up on the Moon (Nekliudov et al.2007). Three texts with such a plot were recorded, one of them from an inform-ant whose parents were Khalkha Mongolians but lived among the Darkhats ofKhubsugul Aimak. In other areas of Mongolia the motif is unknown, and itseems that it is connected only with Siberia, not with Central Asia. The Khub-sugul Darkhats relatively recently shifted to the use of the Mongolian lan-guage, and their culture is similar to that of Todzha Tuvins (Zhukovskaia 1980:151). In the early 20th century the Darkhat shamans still used the Tuvin lan-guage to address spirits (Sanzheev 1930: 7).Different groups of Buryats also seem to inherit the ‘water-carrier on theMoon’ from a pre-Mongolian sub-stratum. Among them this tale was recordedmany times in a form which was near to the ‘poor step-daughter’: a girl’s step-mother or her own mother who married another man sends her to fetch waterand expresses a wish that the Moon would take her (Galdanova 1987: 17; Khan-galov 1958: 319; 1960: 14; Potanin 1883: 190–193; Sharakshinova 1980: 49–50).Among several groups of Yakuts (Alekseev et al. 1995: 197–199; Gurvich 1948:130; 1977: 199; Khudiakov 1969: 279, 372–373; Ovchinnikov 1897, No. 5–6:179–181; Popov 1949: 260–261; Seroshevski 1896: 667; Tolokonskii 1914: 89),Evenki (Potanin 1893: 385; Rychkov 1922: 83–84; Vasilevich 1936: 73–74; 1959:165; Voskoboinikov 1967: 159), and Lamut (Novikova 1987: 43–44), ‘water-car-rier on the Moon’ is known mainly in its ‘poor step-daughter’ variant though inrare cases the motif of two children who looked at the Moon and were drawn toit is also recorded (Khudiakov 1969: 279). The ‘water-carrier on the Moon’, in avariant identical to the ‘poor step-daughter’ of the Evenki, is present among"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 4419The Pleiades as Openings, The Milky Way as the Path of Birds, and The Girl On the Moonthe Negidal (Khasanova & Pevnov 2003: 55–56; Lopatin 1922: 330) and Nanai(Arseniev 1995: 152; Chadaeva 1990: 34–35; Lopatin 1922: 330) but not amongpeoples of Primorye and Sakhalin. This argues in favor of a connection of thismotif in this region with Tungus and not with a pre-Tungus sub-stratum. Moreprecisely, the Nivkh version of the ‘poor step-daughter’ exists but it was re-corded recently (Turaev 2008: 186) and is absent among the materials of Stern-berg or Kreinovich, so a late borrowing from Tungus groups is not excluded.The same image of a girl or a woman seen on the Moon and holding a pail or ascoop is, however, known to the Udihe (Podmaskin 1991, No. 17: 125) and wasrecorded among the Nivkh in the early 20th century (Ishida 1998: 24; Kreinovich1973: 32–33). The Ainu of Sakhalin and Hokkaido see on the Moon a girl whowent to fetch water and was taken by the Moon to become his wife (Pilsudski1912, No. 3: 73–74; 1991, No. 3: 70–72) or who was envious and insulted theMoon accusing her of being idle (Ishida 1998: 24–25), or else the Ainu see inthe lunar disc a boy who insulted the Moon in the same way (Batchelor1927: 260). The motif of a woman seen on the Moon with pails in her hands (noother details) is known in southern Japan (Inoui 2005), while myths recordedon the Ryukyu Islands (Miyako and Okinawa) explain how a man with a water-pail ended up on the Moon (Nevski 1996: 267–269). In Northeast Asia the ‘poororphan’ variant of the ‘water-carrier on the Moon’ is recorded among Yukaghirs(Nikolaeva et al. 1989, No. 2: 21–23) and among Russian-speaking dwellers ofMarkovo village who have Yukaghirs (the Chuvan) among their ancestors(Hakkarainen 1999). The ‘water-carrier’ is absent among Paleoasiatic peoples,though the Chukchi (Bogoras 1939: 22–23; Bogoras 1928, No. 2: 301–302), theKoryak (Beretti 1929: 36) and the Kamchadal (Porotov & Kosygin 1969: 33)have a less specific motif of a girl who ended up on the Moon.One particular detail is typical of Siberian texts recorded among the Khakas,Tofa, Buryat, Ket, Selkup, Khanty, Yakut, and southeastern Evenki. When thewater-carrier was being taken up to the Moon, he or she tried to hold a bushand is now seen on the lunar disc holding both the pails and the bush. Thesame detail is present among the Vakhan of Pamir and the Koryak. In theKoryak story (Beretti 1929: 36) there is no mention of pails, but the entireepisode with a girl whom her evil step-mother drove to a river to fetch water issimilar to the Yakut and Evenki variants. In Southern Siberia among the Teleut,Altai, and Khakas, this motif is not linked to the water-carrier motif, and itwas an ogre who attempted to hold a bush to prevent being pulled up to theMoon.We can summarize that the motif of a girl or young woman who went tofetch water and ended up on the Moon is widespread across Eurasia from theEastern Baltic to the Sea of Okhotsk. Adjacent to this area, variants are found"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"20 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri Berezkinin which either the motif of water to be fetched by a person is lost, or else theactors are a boy, a man, or two children instead of a girl. Nowhere in thisperiphery, with the exception of the Koryaks, does the Moon take the water-carrier up to the sky because he feels sorry for her. In addition to Mongolian,Japanese and Paleoasiatic materials, Scandinavian and Western Europeanvariants should be mentioned among the peripheral traditions. Thus in Ire-land people saw on the Moon two boys who carried a stick with a pail of wateron it (Krappe 1938: 120), while in Northern Germany it was a man with apitcher in his hands, a child with a pail, a thief who carried two stolen pailswith water, or two men who held yokes with water-tubs (Ishida 1998: 20–21;Krappe 1940: 168; Wolf 1929: 55–56). Also in Scandinavia, it was two childrenwith a yoke and a pail (The Younger Edda 1970: 20) or two old men who tried todrown the Moon with water (Krappe 1938: 120).It is of utmost interest that texts recorded beyond Eurasia are similar tothe typical Eurasian variant of ‘woman insults the Moon’. In particular, ‘water-carrier on the Moon’ is known to most peoples of the Northwest Coast of NorthAmerica and of the Fraser River basin in the adjacent Plateau area.Tlingit. One of two girls says that the Moon is like her grandmother’slabret. Immediately the two girls are on the Moon. The one who insulted theMoon falls to earth and is shattered, while her friend is now seen on the lunardisc with a pail in her hand (Swanton 1908b: 453).Haida. A woman goes to fetch water and points at the Moon, then imaginessomebody sitting in the well and points at this figure. At night she gets thirsty,returns to the well, somebody grasps her hand and pulls her up. She tries tohold onto a bush of salal-berries and is now visible on the Moon carrying thebush and a pail (Swanton 1908a: 450–452).Tsimshian (Ness River). A woman points at the Moon and at its reflectionin the water. The Moon takes her to the sky while she is carrying a berry-bush. Now she is seen on the Moon with the bush and the water-pail in herhands (Boas 1916: 864).Bella Coola. A woman with a pail of water in her hands is seen on theMoon (McIlwraith 1948: 225).Oowekeeno. A little boy is crying, his sister puts him outdoors, and giveshim a toy pail to play with. He keeps crying, she warns him that the Moon willtake him away. The Moon descends and takes him, now he is seen on the Moonwith a little pail in his hand (Boas 1895: 217; 2002: 457).Kwakiutl (Newtee). The Moon descends to earth, asks for some water. Agirl goes out with a pail, he abducts her. When he descends again to abductanother girl, the mother of the first one warns her about danger but she toocomes out with a pail of water and is now seen on the Moon holding the pail inher hands (Boas 1895: 191; 2002: 409)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 4421The Pleiades as Openings, The Milky Way as the Path of Birds, and The Girl On the MoonShuswap. In winter time the Moon travels constantly. His wife asks wherethey are going to camp. The Moon suggests that she camp on his face. Shejumps on it and is still seen there with her buckets and shovel, with whichthey melt snow (Teit 1909: 653).Thompson. The Moon sends his sister to fetch water. Coming back shefinds no place to sit and he suggests that she sit on his face. Now a woman withpails in her hands is seen on the Moon (Teit 1898: 91–92).Quinault. The Moon was as bright as the Sun. Many girls desire him buthe chooses the Frog. Now she is seen on the lunar disc holding a box with herproperty and a pail in her hands (Thompson & Egesdal 2008: 207–209).In the latter three texts the motif of water-carrier typical for the NorthwestCoast is combined with the motif, typical for the Salish, of a person, usuallythe Frog-woman, clinging to the face of the Moon and seen now as spots on thelunar disc.Beyond the Northwest Coast the water-carrier is recorded among theAlgonkians to the north of the Great Lakes. In a myth of Northern Ojibwa(Sandy Lake), a woman, sending her son to fetch water, warns him not to lookat the Moon. The lad disappears and is now seen on the Moon holding a ladleand a pail (Ray & Stevens 1971: 81). This story was known to different groupsof Swampy Cree with a difference that the boy is warned not by his mother butby his elder sister (Bird 2007: 36–37; Clay 1978: 28–33; Ellis 1995: 23–27, 29–33, 119). In an Ojibwa myth recorded to the north of Lake Superior a womancooks maple syrup and pours it from one pail into another. When the Moonsees that she urinates on the same place, the Moon is offended and takes thewoman to the sky. When the Sun, who was the Moon’s husband, learned ofthis, he punished his wife, making her carry the woman eternally. Now thewoman with a pail is seen on the Moon (Jones 1919: 637).‘Water-carrier on the Moon’ is known to the Maori of New Zealand. As soonas Hina scooped water with her gourd vessel, clouds hid the Moon, Hina stum-bled and water poured out. Hina scolded the Moon, the Moon seized her andHina clutched at a bush. Now she is seen on the Moon with a bush and a gourdvessel in hands (Ishida 1998: 26). In another variant, it was a man, Rona byname, who ended up on the Moon (Reed 1999, No. 16: 190–192). In yet anotherversion, Rona is the name of a woman (Dixon 1916: 87–88). It seems that thevariant was predominant which had a female person ending up on the Moon.Some incomplete parallels for this myth are found on other Polynesian is-lands, and water containers are seen on the Moon together with a woman(Beckwith 1970: 220–221; Dixon 1916: 88; Williamson 1933: 100). Though NewZealand is extremely remote from Siberia, the ultimate sources of the Maorimyth should be looked for at the probable Austronesian homeland in East Asia"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"22 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri Berezkinbecause nothing of the kind is present in Melanesia and Indonesia. The motifof a bush grasped by a woman who came to the river and was pulled up tothe Moon firmly links the Maori variant to those found among the Haida andTsimshian, and among many Siberian peoples. To attribute the spread of taleswith such specific details to the influence of the Europeans or to think thatthey emerged independently would be unrealistic.CONCLUSIONSDistributions of the three cosmonyms described above largely coincide. Allthree motifs are typical for the Eastern Baltic and Middle Volga region. In twocases out of three (‘the Pleiades as sieve’ and ‘the water-carrier on the Moon’)the southernmost of the Middle Volga groups, i.e. the Mordvin, is the only onein this region for which no data on these images are found. All these motifs aretypical for some or for many of the northern Russian provinces and not typicalfor southern Russia or for the Ukraine except for a small enclave at Volyn’. Itis clear that these motifs came to the Eastern Slavs from a sub-stratum popu-lation. Northern Samoyeds (Nenets, Enets and Nganasans) are not familiarwith these three motifs while the Selkups, more precisely only the southernSelkups, have just one of them, the ‘water-carrier on the Moon’. The ‘path ofbirds’ is known to all Finno-Ugrians and ‘the water-carrier on the Moon’ isknown to most of them other than the Mordvin and the Hungarians. The ‘pathof birds’ and ‘the water-carrier on the Moon’ are both present among Kazakhand Kirgiz, while the Altai-Sayan Turks lack them. Among the Kazakh of theMiddle Zhuz, ‘sieve’ is recorded as a name for the Pleiades. To the east of theYenissei River only the motif of the water-carrier on the Moon is widespread,and among the Yakut, Evenki and Buryat it was recorded many times. How-ever, considering ‘sieve’’ as a particular variant, applied to the Pleiades, of themotif of ‘stars as openings in the firmament’, the ‘sieve’ still connects EasternEurope with Siberia. In addition, ‘the path of birds’ was also known to theAmur Evenki. The Algonkians to the north of the Great Lakes have ‘the pathof birds’ and ‘the water-carrier on the Moon’, and also a possible parallel forthe image of the Pleiades as an opening in the sky. ‘The water-carrier on theMoon’ is also typical for Indians of the Northwest Coast and for the Salish inthe southern Northwest Coast and northern Plateau areas. Taking into con-sideration the complete absence of such motifs among American Indians wholived farther to the south than the Salish and the Ojibwa, the Siberian sourceof these images is plausible. If so, we have to push the dating of their spread inEurasia back to the Early Holocene at the latest."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 44Folklore 4423The Pleiades as Openings, The Milky Way as the Path of Birds, and The Girl On the MoonWhen the ice caps melted, peopling of the northern territories of EasternEurope came mainly from the south. Archaeologists trace the first post-glacialcultures of the Eastern Baltic back to the Final Paleolithic Swiderian cultureand this conclusion corresponds well to data from craniology and populationgenetics (Niskanen 2002: 144–147). The spread of some mythological motifsalso fits such a scenario (Napolskikh 1990). However, the areal patterns of themotifs reviewed above make us suggest that there was also some migrationtaking place from the East. Even if the Evenki and Algonkian data concerning‘the path of birds’ are ignored and the motif of stars as sky-openings is notconsidered specific enough, the pattern of the spread of the ‘water-carrier onthe Moon’ makes the hypothesis of trans-Eurasian migration plausible. Re-membering the detailed American and Polynesian parallels for the Easternand Southern Siberian variants, the Northern Eurasian East, rather than theWest should be suggested as the earliest zone of the spread of this motif. TheBulgarian-Macedonian enclave of the ‘water-carrier’ clearly cannot be a sourcefor Siberian, not to speak of Amerindian and Polynesian myths, and Bulgarianmaterials rather demonstrate the existence of some late Baltic-Balkan links.To determine the origins of the ‘water-carrier on the Moon’ in the Balkansit would be desirable to compare the Bulgarian-Macedonian materials withSerbian ones. Unfortunately, Serbian interpretations of the spots on the Moonare of late origin and include only variants typical for most of the ChristianEurope (Janković 1951: 108–109). A version which is specific to Bulgarian vari-ants (a boy and a girl come to a well and end up on the Moon) is found else-where only among Northern Russians (Gura 2006: 462). The Macedonian case(the Moon saves a poor stepdaughter who now stands on the Moon with twopails of water) is close to Lithuanian, Estonian and Middle Volga versions.During the Final Pleistocene – Early Holocene, more detailed ideas aboutthe objects of the night sky had probably been forming in Northern and Cen-tral Eurasia. From Eurasia the corresponding ideas were brought to NorthAmerica. In the Indo-Pacific borderlands of Asia, in Australia, South and Cen-tral America the cosmonymy had developed independently and does not dem-onstrate parallels with North Eurasian – North American set of images andplots, while in sub-Saharan Africa its development had been minimal. As newimages in Siberia and Eastern Europe did not displace earlier ones but wereadded to them, a minimal number of small groups of migrants from the Eastwas probably enough for spreading the new cosmonymy across most ofEurasia. If such migrants were forest hunters and fishermen, the natural limitof their western spread had to be the Baltic Sea. I think that this is the ulti-mate reason for differences between sets of cosmonyms in the Eastern Balticarea and in Central Europe."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"24 www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folklore www.folklore.ee/folkloreYuri BerezkinACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis article is supported by grant 07-06-00441-a of the Russian Foundation forBasic Research and by the project “The earliest population of Siberia and mi-grations to the New World”, under a special program of the Presidium of theRussian Academy of Sciences, “Historic-cultural heritage and spiritual valuesof Russia”.COMMENTS1 The database for the work is the electronic catalogue of world mythology and folklore.Abstracts in Russian and sources of texts see at http://www.ruthenia.ru/folklore/berezkin.
