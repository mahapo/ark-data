traditionally conceptualized in terms of supernatural relationswith the spirit world. The relationship of the cross-cultural featuress of shamanismand its ritual practices to human biology has been generally ignored. Skeptics favora view that such practices are basically concerned with nonempirical and ephemeralfeatures, while believers see such spiritual concerns as falling outside of the physicalworld and the purview of science.I reject both of these perspectives in favor of a biopsychosocial approach toshamanism that addresses spirituality as an intrinsic part of human nature. Theworld-wide manifestations of shamanistic practices and their relationships toinnate aspects of our brain functions indicate that they should be understood inevolutionary terms. This book seeks a reconciliation between scientific and spiritualviews, taking a neurotheology perspective that addresses the relationships ofshamanism and universal spiritual impulses to human nature.The bold thesis ofShamanismis that we should examine the roles of thespiritual in human evolution. Whatever the ultimate source of our intuitions ofspiritual and transcendent realities, such concepts have played a significant rolein human cognitive and social evolution. Without embracing the content of spiritconcepts with an certainty, we can nonetheless accept that such conceptions haveplayed important roles in the systems of thought and action that have guidedadaptive human responses. Evolution acts on behaviors and their effects on fitness,and assumptions about a spiritual world can have a variety of direct effects in pro-ducing fitness-enhancing behaviors.This approach may offend those who view human biology as irrelevant to thetranscendental spiritual impulses, ignoring the roles of biology in producing theprofound experiences of altered consciousness that are so compellingly interpretedin spiritual terms. The idealist view of the power of the spiritual need not be aban-doned in a scientific understanding of the nature of shamanism. As Deacon (1997)presented inThe Symbolic Species, the spiritual is an intrinsic part of symbolismand the evolution of human cognitive capacities. The human experience of our soulxiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"in a sense of a self that is independent of our body is produced through symbols.These symbols can create an independent “virtual” identity of the disembodied self.This self reflects the power of the symbolic capacity to free one’s perceptions fromthe constraints of the immediate present, to allow imagination to take precedencein guiding adaptive behaviors, and to travel back and forward in mental time toreview information and possibilities. These evolved capacities of the mind suchas the shamanic soul journey allow the imagined to take precedence over theimmediate material.The symbolic representations of spirits reflect these recently evolved pro-cesses of mind that provide an ability to use internalized abstract models toengage in learning by extrapolating different possible scenarios and behaviors.The spiritual epitomizes the symbolic features considered to be a defining charac-teristic of our species. Spirits exemplify the properties of the symbolic, providinga system of representation that transcends the physical; indeed, spirits may be theultimate symbols, without any referent in the physical world, and with meaningonly in a community of like-minded individuals. It is in the search for thosehidden systems of meaning that humans encountered the adaptive potentials ofthe spiritual to guide our perceptions and behaviors.xivPREFACE"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsI thank a generation of scholars who have engaged my biological perspectiveson shamanism, making possible this second edition ofShamanismand its updates.I also thank John Baker, my coauthor ofSupernatural as Natural(Winkelman andBaker 2008), who contributed to the sharpening of my biological and evolutionaryapproaches to shamanism, ritual, and healing practices.

In 2009, the term shamanhad more than 12 million hits on Google and 50,000 listings in Google Scholar andnearly a thousand subject listings inBooks in Print. The concept has become so dif-fused and accepted that even indigenous groups are now adopting the termshamanto communicate about their own spiritual healing practices.This expansion of the use of the concept of shamanism has made the termeven more problematic. Many are overwhelmed by the multitude of manifesta-tions of shamanistic phenomena and cannot seem to find a definable or empiricalshamanism. This book presents research that helps us understand both the originalmanifestations of shamanism and the diversity of manifestations of shamanisticphenomena produced by social influences on our innate potentials for ritual, alter-ations of consciousness, and endogenous healing responses.The primary purpose of this revision is not to update the diversity of contem-porary shamanistic manifestations, but rather to better elucidate shamanism’s rolesin our past. During this last decade my focus has extended back in time to explain-ing the origins of shamanism and its roles in the emergence of modern humans,and beyond that into its evolution from our ancient primate ritual heritage. Thesedevelopments have also helped sharpen my original purpose—presenting a biopsy-chosocial paradigm for understanding shamanism. This explicit paradigmaticapproach is reflected in the altered subtitle:A Biopsychosocial Paradigm of Con-sciousness and Healing. This biologically based evolutionary framework for under-standing humanity’s most ancient spiritual and healing tradition explains thecross-cultural distribution of remarkably similar spiritual and healing practicesand consciousness traditions. The shamanic paradigm also provides a frameworkfor understanding the biological bases and evolution of religion, as John Bakerand I have demonstrated inSupernatural as Natural(Winkelman and Baker 2008).The paradigmatic approach provides a framework for a thorough revisionof the first edition, including the reorganization of the material within andxvii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"among chapters. The chapters are also updated with new material on the biologi-cal bases of shamanistic healing practices and alterations of consciousness. A newchapter on the origins of shamanism expands our understanding of the biologicalorigins of shamanic practices by linking them to the collective rituals of our clos-est relatives, the chimpanzees. Homologies between shamanism and chimpanzeerituals provide a framework for inferences regarding the ancient ritual capacitiesof the hominids, the common ancestors of humans and the great apes. Thesehominid commonalities in ritual displays also provide a baseline from which wecan infer and assess the evolutionary changes in hominins (our uniquely humanlineage) that led to the distinctive features of shamanism. Shamanic adaptationswere significant features of hominin evolution. Furthermore, shamanic featuresin cave paintings from the Upper/Middle Paleolithic transition indicate that thesepractices are central to humanity’s evolution from archaicHomo sapiens sapiensinto our culturally modern—but ancient—human ancestors.This revised edition extends multidisciplinary perspectives in emphasizingthe usefulness of evolutionary theory in addressing issues that have largely beenthe domain of religious studies. Biological perspectives on shamanism shouldbe at the basis of our understandings of the evolutionary origins of religion andtheir relationship to our evolved psychology. Shamanism reflects exaptations ofour primate heritage: the use of an ancient adaptation—ritual—as a mechanismfor new social and psychological adaptations. Ritual’s original functions of socialcoordination served as the basis for new adaptations to enhance psychologicaland social integration in increasingly multilevel and fragmented human societies.These processes were key aspects of the evolution of human social and cognitivecomplexity and provide psychosocial functions that still have important implica-tions for humans today. These potentials provided the basis for the evolution ofmore complex social groups, bonding unrelated individuals into an altruisticdynamic through modifications of consciousness that facilitated attachmentwith an expanded group of others. Altered states of consciousness enhancedaccess to dream functions, manifested in a presentational (imagestic) symbolicconsciousness that provided cognitive tools and workspace for the developmentof mythological systems representing self, mind, and others. Ritually inducedshamanic experiences produced synthetic symbolic representations that areexemplified in the shamanic soul journey and in guardian spirits. Basic featuresof these experiences indicate that they constitute forms of self-objectificationand role-taking that expanded human intrapsychic and social dynamics. Similarprocessesarefoundintheclassicshamanicexperienceofdeathandrebirth,asymbolic death of the old self that permits the emergence and integration ofa higher order self.The cross-cultural similarities in shamanic practices and experiences reflectbiological bases. These recurrent features of shamanism reflect neurognosticstructures, biologically based aspects of the human capacities for knowing. Thisbook presents a neurophenomenological approach for understanding shamanisticexperiences, examining how their phenomenological qualities are related to neuro-logical functions. This approach helps explain how ritual practices exert effects onconsciousness and provide healing processes. This approach deliberately articulatesxviiiINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the relationships between two complementary realms of information: (1) phenom-enal experiences found cross-culturally in shamanism; and (2) knowledge of thebrain structures and functions. This interdisciplinary synthesis expands our under-standing of spirituality by establishing homologies between what have been tradi-tionally considered separate fields of endeavor, knowledge of the religious,spiritual, or mystical experiences on one hand; and on the other, the knowledgeof the brain operations provided by the neurosciences.This approach to understanding the nature of shamanistic phenomenareveals that it involves a natural symbolic system that represents basic aspectsof consciousness, self, mental processes, and social and emotional dynamics.Shamanism evolved by exaptation of ritual practices and potentials, extendingthe use of these ancient communication adaptations to serve new functionsinvolving psychophysiological and symbolical manipulation of biological sub-strates to enhance well-being. The meditative traditions are the descendants ofshamanism, extending these potentials in examining and controlling the atten-tional, perceptual, and conceptual processes underlying consciousness. Explicitlyrelating neurophysiology to experiences provides a basis for illustrating the bio-logical bases of shamanistic healing practices and their adaptive potentials. Thesebiopsychosocial approaches also help explain the modern appeal of shamanismand the continued relevance of shamanistic practices and perspectives to modernhumans. The central role of ritual and shamanic practices in the evolution ofhuman consciousness implies that it still provides a variety of adaptive potentialsderived from an enhanced and integrative operation of consciousness, withimportant applications in contemporary problems such as in treatment of addic-tions (Winkelman 2001a, 2009b; Winkelman and Roberts 2007).ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOKThe new edition is reorganized in several ways but still addresses three major con-cerns: (1) a cross-cultural perspective on the nature and the basis of shamanismand its relationship to other spiritual healing practices; (2) a neurophenomenolog-ical perspective on the nature of shamanistic experiences and the characteristics ofthe integrative mode of consciousness; and (3) the mechanisms of shamanistichealing. These original concerns are extended in a new chapter addressing the evo-lutionary origins of shamanism.Chapter 1 provides a new introduction that integrates the previous prefacewith an overview of the biological and evolutionary perspectives central to thisbook. This helps to clarify the shamanic paradigm, a biopsychosocial frameworkfor understanding shamanism. A key feature of this shamanic paradigm is a bio-logically based integrative mode of consciousness that is as fundamental to humannature as the deep sleep, dream, and waking modes of consciousness. Other basesof shamanic universals are rooted in what have been called innate modules, opera-tors and functional systems in the context of evolutionary psychology. Central fea-tures of shamanism reflect the integration of the outputs of innate modules toproduce new forms of analogical cognition, providing a framework for explainingshamanism’s relevance to broader questions regarding the nature and causes ofINTRODUCTIONxix"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"humanity’s religious impulses. Shamanism provides a grounding for evolutionaryapproaches by its foundations in the phylogenetically ancient communication sys-tems of ritual, the adaptive benefits of costly displays, and the biologically basedalterations of consciousness that induce healing responses.Chapter 2 presents the empirical characteristics of shamanism demonstratedby cross-cultural research, which reveals similar magico-religious practicesworldwide in hunter-gatherer societies. This worldwide distribution of spiritualhealing practices sharing the same fundamental characteristics and functionsdemonstrates the empirical reality of shamanism and reflects a biological basis.This chapter includes new material addressing the debate regarding whether ornot shamanism is truly an empirically valid cross-cultural concept by distinguish-ing an empirically similar cross-cultural manifestation of shamans in foragingsocieties from the diversity of shamanistic healers that reflect modern manifesta-tions of shamanic potentials. The prehistoric presence of shamanism is found inlinguistic survivals in English, Sanskrit, and other Indo-European languages, aswell as in the Paleolithic cave art of Europe. The shamanic paradigm provides apowerful framework for interpreting the human past and showing how the effectsof shamanic group rituals and ideologies provided cognitive bases for enhancedgroup functioning.Chapter 3 presents a systems perspective on the nature of consciousness asa framework for evaluating the key elements of altered consciousness involvedin shamanism. The fundamental aspects of human consciousness manifested inbodily knowing and their presentation in images are central aspects of shamanism.Shamanism is also concerned with the socioemotional and self-functions of thepaleomammalian brain and with cognitive capacities based in metaphor, analogy,and mimesis. The universals of shamanic thought reflect innate psycho- and socio-biological bases of knowing. The integration and dissociation of these representa-tional capacities provides the structures and distinctive features of soul journeys,guardian spirit allies, death-and-rebirth experiences, and other forms of shamaniccognition. These cognitive potentials are examined as manifestations of a presenta-tional symbolic modality that preceded language and which also gave rise to newcognitive potentials.Chapter 4 examines the principal shamanistic alterations of consciousness,relating their characteristics to biological effects of different ritual induction prac-tices and selection procedures involved. The shamanic soul journey has phenom-enological aspects that reflect physiological effects of induction procedures thatalter the connections between the experienced and physical selves. Significant fea-tures of the shamanic induction practices involve thwarting basic human drives(food, water, sex, rest, sleep), as well as altering neurotransmitter levels by provok-ing elevated dopamine and opioid levels through the effects of ritual and accessingexogenous sources of neurotransmitters in psychedelic plants. Meditative forms ofconsciousness are considered from neuroepistemological perspectives that examinethe neurological bases of our knowledge of the world. These perspectives illustratemeditative perceptions as natural, or innate, forms of cognition. The basic aspectsof meditation involving control of perception, attention, cognition, and emotionillustrate how shamanistic states of consciousness constitute special forms ofxxINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"knowing. Possession exhibits features similar to a variety of neuropsychiatricphenomena, including temporal lobe syndromes, ictal personality, and multiplepersonality disorder. Comparing them with phenomenological manifestations ofpossession illustrates that similar biological processes may be shaped in differentways and result in distinctly different personal and social adaptations. What theseforms of knowing share is an enhanced access to what is conventionally understoodas aspects of the subconscious and unconscious mind, structures primarily man-aged by the dynamics of the paleomammalian brain and its emotional and self-functions.Chapter 5 analyses the bases for shamanistic healing in terms of effectsderived from altering consciousness to produce an experience of the spiritualworld in community rituals. The psychobiology of the integrative mode of con-sciousness involves a number of therapeutic mechanisms that activate and inte-grate unconscious processes. A significant aspect of shamanic healing involves theuse of innate capacities such as music. Others include the sacred medicines, whichI have reconceptualized as “psychointegrators” in recognition of their therapeuticeffects derived from their interaction with the serotonergic nervous system. Thefunctions of the spirit world in shamanic healing include their roles as symbolicrepresentations that facilitate regulation of the stress mechanisms; modification ofself-concepts; and integration of the concepts of the “other.” Community ritualsprovide a number of mechanisms of shamanistic healing, particularly as proce-dures for altering physiological, psychological, and emotional responses by elicitingopioid mechanisms.Chapter 6 is a new chapter, addressing the evolutionary origins of shaman-ism (see Winkelman [2002a, 2009], Winkelman and Baker [2008]). The universalfeatures of shamanism provide a paradigmaticframework for identifying thehomologies with features of chimpanzee rituals. These homologies identify theritual dynamics characteristic of our ancient hominid ancestors and the phyloge-netic origins of shamanic ritual. Differences between chimpanzee and shamanicrituals suggest an evolutionary zone of development and reveal those uniquelyhuman features selected across hominin evolution to produce shamanism. A cen-tral feature of shamanic ritual is healing, reflecting a coevolution of religiosityand spiritual healing. Healing is based in the tendencies toward altruism andexpanded in the hypnotic capacity and associated placebo responses. These tenden-cies contribute to the alteration of consciousness, a capacity that was selected foracross hominin evolution.This capacity for alterations of consciousness resulted from several factors:adaptive endogenous responses to trauma; the selective influences of psychedelicmushrooms; enhanced dopamine and opioid systems and their effects on cogni-tion and sociality; long-distance running and its production of mystical experien-ces; and the mimesis-based expressive capacities of music and dance. Thesefeatures illustrate how evolutionary adaptations and exaptations produced expe-riences and tendencies that were subsequently subjected to selection for theircapacities to enhance the social, psychological, and cognitive functions of ritual.Shamanism has foundations in adaptive aspects of our brain systems; theseaspects reflect neurognostic structures, the innate structural features of humanINTRODUCTIONxxi"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"consciousness and knowing. The practices of shamanism tapped into and inte-grated these capacities, producing a human cultural evolution by using ritual activ-ities to exploit innate potentials in new adaptive ways involving symbolism.Shamanic practices also contributed to human adaptation in their ability tomanipulate psychobiological processes through ritual and symbols in order toenhance health and well-being. These processes include stimulating endogenoushealing responses and our ability to function more effectively in social groups. Thislinkage of shamanic practices to human evolution, psychobiology, and psychocog-nitive potentials indicates that shamanism is part of the neural ecology of humanconsciousness, with continued relevance and applications to humans today.Shamanism’s ancient foundations in our hominid ritual roots and hominin evo-lution indicate that these concerns must be central to any comprehensive explan-ation of humanity’s religious and spiritual impulses.This second edition goes beyond perfunctory revisions to offer a significantextension of the vision of shamanism in the first edition. The more explicit biop-sychosocial paradigmatic framework and its integration with evolutionary theoryprovides a more complete understanding of shamanism. The focus on the biologi-cal bases of shamanism helps illustrate why shamanism is core to explaining theevolutionary origins of religion. It also illustrates why shamanism is an indispensi-ble aspect of any comprehensive understanding of human’s relations with thesupernatural. This second edition ofShamanismoffers a broader and deeper visionof the relevance of shamanism to understanding not only religion but also human-ity’s origins and cognitive evolution and our human nature.xxiiINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1Introduction toShamanism andConsciousnessCHAPTER OVERVIEWShamanic practices reflect a virtual universal of human culture, institutionalizedritual procedures that engage a basic human drive for altering consciousness.In most times and places these practices have produced experiences interpretedin supernatural terms and considered among the most important of the culture.Shamanistic experiences provide an important contrastive perspective to wakingconsciousness and its rational discourse. Understanding these human universalsof central importance to religion, philosophy, spirituality, healing, and creativityrequires contextualizing the alteration of consciousness in relation to the struc-tures and functions of the brain. What is the nature of shamanic consciousness,and how is it different from ordinary consciousness?Consciousness varies in a multitude of ways, reflective of individual, group,developmental, and species differences. It is commonalities and recurrent pat-terns of consciousness, however, rather than unique differences,that are mostimportant to understanding consciousness. These patterns that are shared byhumans and some other animals help to reveal the general nature of conscious-ness and the special features of altered consciousness in particular. Characterizingthe nature and foundations of altered consciousness requires a neurophenome-nological framework linking biological functions and structures to phenomeno-logical experience. A neurophenomenological approach identifies the fourmajor modes of consciousness: deep sleep, dreaming, waking, and integrative.These different modes of consciousness reflect cyclic systemic operations of brainstructures in adaptation to external and internalenvironmentsand provide acontext for understanding the special properties of altered consciousness.Cross-cultural perspectives show important similarities in the experiences ofaltered consciousness. These similarities reflect underlying biological factorsuniversal to the human species, and which are the basis for commonalities inthe significance of altered consciousness across cultures and human history.

Shamanistic practices pro-duce a parasympathetic-dominant state with entrainment of the frontal cortex byhighly coherent and synchronized slow-wave discharges (especially theta waves,36 cycles per second) originating in the paleomammalian brain structures (limbicbrain). These brain wave conditions produce an integration of informationprocessing between the limbic system and lower brain structures, between theseareas and the frontal cortex, and between the hemispheres of the cortex; hencethe labeling of these conditions as involving theintegrativemode of conscious-ness. These innate integrative capacities of the brain are one root of shamanism’sadaptive potentials. This chapter introduces frameworks for an evolutionaryunderstanding of the biological bases of humans’ ritual and religious impulsesand their relations to human consciousness.INTRODUCTION: SHAMANISM ANDTHE ALTERATION OF CONSCIOUSNESSShamanism, humanity’s most ancient spiritual and healing tradition, has ree-merged in contemporary societies’ religious, spiritual, and healing practices andconsciousness traditions. Although the precise basis and the nature of shamanismhave often been ambiguous, it has been broadly recognized as a primordial, natu-ral form of healing and modification of consciousness, a human heritage withcontinued relevance for today’s world. Shamanic phenomena and the associatedalterations of consciousness have traditionally been attributed to the supernaturaland spiritual domains. With the rise of modern science, materialism, and bio-medicine, shamanic practices were denounced as fraud, trickery, and delusion.Psychiatric explanations portrayed such phenomena as forms of dissociation,hysteria, psychopathology, and mistaken magical cognition. It was presumed thatshamanistic practices, like other aspects of religious thought and behavior, woulddisappear with the spread of modern rationality.Just as it seemed shamanism might slip into its final demise within modernrational consciousness, its practices reemerged in modern societies. The generalnotion that religious behavior declined in the twentieth century is a mispercep-tion. While traditional religious denominations and churches have declined, reli-gious participation has grown through sects, cults, and individual spiritualpractices. These range from groups such as Pentecostalists to a variety of Eastern-import religions—Unification Church, Transcendental Meditation, Hare Krishna,Buddhism, Hinduism, and others. Scholarly investigators have often characterizedpeople’s attraction to religion as a source of refuge and comfort to the downtrod-den. In contrast to this viewpoint, the adherents to these new spiritual healinggroups and the shamanistic practices in fact tend to be educated people from eco-nomically privileged sectors and the health professions.The attraction of those in the healing professions to shamanism is supported bynew evidence and perspectives provided by the fields of medical anthropology, con-sciousness studies, transpersonal psychology, the anthropology of consciousness,2SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and studies of psychedelic medicines. These perspectives reveal a multi-dimensionality to shamanism, a biopsychosocial practice involving techniquesfor the alteration of consciousness, healing, and personal development. Shamanicactivities are reconceptualized as sophisticated ethnomedical practices that pro-vide important cultural healing resources and an alternative epistemology of causeand remediation of health maladies. Shamanistic practices also manipulatephysiological processes, psychophysiological reactions, and social psychologyand relations. The emerging understanding of shamanistic practices locates theirfoundations in biological potentials, with deeply embedded roots in the functionalbases of ritual, a foundational communicative and relational capacity of vertebratespecies. Shamanism was the context in which hominins and early modern humansexpanded these relational capacities into concerns with personal and social iden-tity, emotional modulation, attachments, sense of self, and personal transforma-tions associated with alterations of consciousness.The alterations of consciousness central to shamanism have their bases inour ancient brain structures, whose functions are the foundation for our emo-tional, personal, social, and cognitive processes. Shamanic practices integratedthese processes, producing experiences that are manifested in various forms ofanalogical thought such as animism, anthropomorphism, totemism, and mimeticenactment. These integrative processes use symbolic capacities of the presenta-tional modality, an imagetic system reflecting deep structures of knowledge thatoperates independently of language. These integrative processes are epitomizedin the visionary experiences that are a signature feature of shamanism.Shamanic experiences were characterized by earlier anthropologists as awe,trance, or ecstasy, and later as nonordinary and altered states of consciousness(ASC). Today we may question the appropriateness of characterizations as“nonordinary” or “altered” as overvaluing the implicit reference to normal con-sciousness. Nonetheless, these powerful transformations of consciousness and theirprofound emotional and experiential effects were recognized by earlier anthropol-ogists as fundamental to magico-religious practices. “Falling into a trance oftenconstitutes the call to a religious vocation and...the ability to enter this state is arequirement for the specialist” (Norbeck 1961, 86). Possession is “one of the magi-cian’s professional qualifications...[and] requires and produces an alteration, amodification in one’s state of mind” (Mauss 1972, 39, 128). The primordial roleinvolving the manipulation of consciousness was that of the shaman. Cross-cultural research (Winkelman 1986a, 1990, 1992) illustrated the universalityof shamans worldwide in hunter-gatherer societies, constituting an ecologicallyspecific adaptation of human psychobiological potentials. Although many of thespecific characteristics of shamanism are not found in the practices of more com-plex societies (i.e., death-and-rebirth experiences, animal transformation, soulflight), there remains a worldwide persistence of shamanistic healers, spiritualhealing practitioners who modify consciousness to interact with spirits on behalfof the community (Winkelman 1990).We need a scientific explanation of the ubiquity of shamanism in hunter-gatherer societies and universal manifestations of shamanistic healers using alter-ations of consciousness as the basis for their training and practice. Why is theINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS3"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"alteration of consciousness found universally and in association with spiritualand healing experiences? The answer explored here examines how rituallyinduced alterations of consciousness provide an integration of behavioral,emotional, and cognitive capacities that enhanced personal and social function-ing. Shamanistic practices reflect adaptations to a biological potential I call theintegrative mode of consciousness (IMC), a functional-structural feature ofhumans as fundamental to our nature as the modes of sleep, dreams and wakingconsciousness.Culture and the Alteration of ConsciousnessThe existence of a universal drive among humans for altering consciousness isstrongly supported bycross-cultural research. Institutionalized procedures forritually altering consciousness have been documented in virtually all societies ofthe world, reflecting a commonality of culture and religion. Bourguignon (1968)reported evidence that approximately 90 percent of the societies in a worldwidesample had institutionalized rituals for altering consciousness, suggesting it waslikely a cultural universal. In another cross-cultural study, Winkelman (1986b,1992) found that communal ritual involving ASC were a cultural universal; allsocieties have magico-religious practitioners who have their professional rolesbased in powers derived from the modification of consciousness.Cultures differ considerably in the attention that they give to learning aboutthe potentials of the IMC, but all cultures have practices that engage these abilitiesbecause they involve adaptive potentials derived from the structures of the brainand consciousness. Even when there is cultural repression of the IMC, experien-ces of this realm of consciousness nonetheless manifest spontaneously andidiosyncratically because they reflect a biological basis. Eliciting the IMC may beachieved in numerous ways, including pushing psychological functions beyondtheir limits, disrupting subsystems by sensory overload or deprivation, manipulat-ing the autonomic nervous system balance, or focusing or withdrawing attention.Even dissociative and pathological statescan destabilize waking consciousnessin ways that permit the manifestation of integrative potentials and experiences.This occurs because an attenuation of the waking mode of consciousness andits primary functions permits the emergence of IMC and the integrative symbolicand cognitive processes that are normally repressed.Cultures relate to the IMC in different ways, either enhancing access andextolling it, or or blocking access and vilifying these experiences. Most ancientcultures have traditions designed to enhance the availability of a range of IMCstates, manifested in conditions labeled soul flight, possession, vision quests,enlightenment, and others. In contrast, the dominant cultural ethos of modernIndo-European societies generally ignored the IMC or subjected those whosought it to pathologization, social marginalization, or persecution. There arewidespread biases against some forms of altered consciousness in Western societyand cultures. Historically, such manifestations were persecuted through witch-craft accusations (Harner 1973b). Western psychology has tended to consider4SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"shamanic-type experiences to be pathological (Noll 1983) or “primitive,” mani-fested in the perspectives that meditative states are regressions to infantile levels(see Wilber [1980] for discussion and critique). Substances that support theWestern cultural ethos such as alcohol,nicotine, and caffeine are often deniedthe status of drugs and normalized, while there are strongly hostile attitudestoward most other drug-induced alterations ofconsciousness. This is reflectedin severe restrictions (medical prescription) or legal prohibition of the use ofmajor psychoactive substances.A contrastive approach is found in the many cultures that have viewed hallu-cinogens asentheogens, sacred plants that produce a contact with the divine (e.g.,see Ra ̈tsch [2005]; Schultes and Hofmann [1979]; Winkelman and Andritzky[1996]). Meditative traditions indicate that altering consciousness provides a vari-ety of adaptive advantages through development of a more objective perception ofthe external world. Rather than being bound up in a habitualized subjectivity,altering consciousness is viewed as a means of developing awareness of the illusoryand constructed nature of ordinary perception.Cultural differences in relating tothe IMC involve degrees of knowledge of “dream culture,” ranging from “mono-phasic” cultures, which institutionally value only waking consciousness, through“polyphasic void” cultures, which encourage exploration of phases of conscious-ness beyond phenomenal reality (Laughlin et al. 1992).The desire to alter consciousness is an innate, biologically based human drivewith adaptive significance (Siegel 1990; Sullivan, Hagen, and Hammerstein 2008;Winkelman 2002a&b), a manifestation of a fundamental homeostatic dynamic ofthe nervous system. These manifestations of consciousness involve a biologicallybased drive with conditions that contrast with and balance the tendencies ofnormal waking consciousness—sympathetic dominance and desynchronizedfast-wave activity of the frontal cortex. The IMC engages a parasympathetic-dominant condition characterized by synchronized and coherent high-voltagetheta wave activity originating in the circuits linking the brain stem and thehippocampal-septal area of the paleomammalian brain with the frontal cortex.These synchronized brain waves ascend from the lower brain areas to the frontallobes, producing an integration of brain wave patterns across the major levels ofthe brain and interhemispheric synchronization of the frontal cortex (Mandell1980). This intensification of the linkages of the lower brain structures, paleo-mammalian brain, and frontal brain structures produces a synthesis of behavior,emotion, and thought.The wide range of procedures used cross-culturally to induce these condi-tions reflects the ability of diverse agents and conditions to evoke this naturalpotential of the human brain-mind. The IMC is a physiologically based modeof organismic functioning and integration that produces a condition of homeo-static balance. The conditions of systemic brain-mind integration provideinformation-processing capacities associated with the visual system and dreams,a special form of symbolic communication. Shamans are the first who learnedto operate within and to utilize this IMC, providing social and psychodynamicintegration and transformation of emotions and identity.

Shamanism was the context within which humansutilized these imagetic structures of consciousness to extend their informationalcapacities in new ways. The shaman is a technician of consciousness who usesthese potentials for acquiring information, healing and personal and social trans-formations. Shamans’ fundamental roles in the evolution of human society andindividual and collective consciousness are illustrated in many key features: theirpreeminent roles in hunter-gatherer societies as the principal political and reli-gious functionaries, the leaders of hunting and group movement from place toplace, and the bearers of cultural mythology. This present work extends the under-standing of shamanism and related shamanistic healing activities by addressingthe biological and psychophysiological bases of these practices. These bases helpexplain shamanism’s fundamental role in healing, self-transformation, and cogni-tive integration.Shamanism and the Study of ConsciousnessShamanistic practices illustrate fundamental aspects of consciousness and therelationships between physical and mental levels of the brain. The cross-culturalsimilarities in features of visions, possession, and other forms of altered con-sciousness and spirit world experiences indicate that they reflect biological struc-tures and functions. Shamanistic forms of consciousness constitute importantcontrastive perspectives to ordinary waking consciousness and, consequently, forunderstanding consciousness in general. The psychophysiological and experientialchanges induced by shamanic activities help elucidate the diverse subsystems thatunderlie ordinary consciousness. Shamanic rituals also produce a broader range ofphenomenal experiences that must be addressed in a comprehensive theory of con-sciousness. Studies of the contemplative traditions provide data about forms ofexperience and aspects of self and identity beyond that conventionally recognizedin Western psychology. Shamanistic practices produce one pole in the variousdualisms of consciousness that contrast the experiences of ordinary egoic wakingconsciousness of the world and its intellectual, verbal, rational, externally orientedfunctioning in adaptation to the external environment. In contrast, shamanismtransforms consciousness to an internal orientation interpreted as a spiritual worldthat is known through a subjective intuition and holistic, tacit, and nonverbal sour-ces of perceptions and knowledge. These shamanic forms of consciousness oblige abroader model of consciousness than that emphasized by the specialized activitiesof the left brain hemisphere.The traditions of European peoples and their New World descendants havetended to depreciate the shamanic forms of consciousness, manifested in manyaspects of historical and current culture: witch hunts; pathological classificationsin psychiatry of mystical states; mycophobia (exaggerated fear of mushrooms);6SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the domination of secularly oriented religious organizations rather than ecstaticsects or cults; the dominance of behaviorist and materialist ideologies in science;and a drug-war mentality in government. This “monophasic consciousness”(Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili 1992) obsessively focused on rationalism hasresulted in a failure to investigate these types of experiences within science in gen-eral. Consequently, the well-developed traditions for understanding the nature ofconsciousness are largely what have been called the mystical,meditative, contem-plative, and philosophical traditions of Asia. The findings of these traditions havegenerally been ignored by science and biomedicine, dismissed as ego regression toinfantile states and as a befuddled way of thinking.These systems developed in Buddhist and other Asian philosophies haveprovided extensive knowledge of the nature of the alteration of consciousness(see Walsh [1980, 1988]; Wilber [1977, 1979, 1980]). The importance of incorpo-rating these Asian perspectives into Western consciousness studies was indicatedby Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili’s (1992) observations that Eastern descrip-tions of consciousness have congruencies with Western neuropsychology’s viewsof how the brain and the nervous system work. Both note that the brain and mindwork as a complex of hierarchically functioning levels that progressively modeland test models of reality. Mystical systems characterize consciousness in wayssimilar to the neurological perspectives on consciousness as involving entrainmentof circuits and networks, regulation of sensory input, information processing, anddetermination of adaptive action.Shamanic and mystical traditions foster development of a different mode ofperception involving deliberate cultivation of an internal visionary or imageticworld, a neurologically based symbolic system traditionally represented in spirits,energies, and other powers. The neurophenomenological perspective illustratesuniversal shamanic beliefs to reflect inherent structures, biologically based modesof knowing. These capacities are manipulated in ritual to promote cognitive evo-lution and psychological integration. The mystical traditions are “state-specificsciences” (Tart 1975) that examine the attentional, perceptual, and cognitiveprocesses underlying consciousness, providing for further development of thehuman intellectual capacity within presentational (Hunt 1995a) and epistemo-logical frameworks (Winkelman 1997a).Although the spiritual vocabulary, concepts, goals, and worldviews usedby mystical traditions have contributed to the perception that they are acceptedon faith rather than as the result of critical analysis, these traditions are appropri-ately characterized as sciences of consciousness (Laughlin et al. 1992; Tart 1975).Procedures have been developed for the replicable observation of consciousness,based on systematic and rigorous examination, reporting, and verification ofexperiences (e.g., see Wilber [1990]). The findings of these mystical traditionshave provided data and conceptualizations about a range of manifestations ofconsciousness that must be central to any comprehensive theory of conscious-ness. Mystical traditions see the altered forms of consciousness as involvingdevelopmental phases subsequent to the rational forms of consciousness thatconstitute the foci of Western psychology. These developments involve the abilityof mind, intention, and consciousness to control the physiological basis fromINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS7"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"which they arise. Mind over matter allows for more effective programming of thehuman biocultural computer.Mental Effects on the OrganismAnother central aspect of shamanistic healing involves what has been called “medi-cine’s symbolic reality” (Kleinman 1980). A universal aspect of the healer-patientrelationship involves the positive transformation of the patient’s well-beingthrough symbols used by the healer and the expectations for improvement thatthey represent. This relationship symbolically manipulates physiological levels, afundamental mechanism of shamanistic action derived from linkages among themental and biological systems through associations, attachments, and affects.These processes, manifested in placebo, psychosomatic, and psychoneuro-immunological phenomena, are central to shamanistic healing and are increasinglybeing recognized in medicine as an empirically effective “religious healing.” Thesehealing processes involve humans’ capacities for hypnotic susceptibility that areextended through our symbolic capacities to enable mythic and cultural processesto evoke physiological changes that produce healing responses.A new paradigm is necessary to explain the ways in which rituals and sym-bolic actions cause physiological responses, the mechanisms through which thesociocultural domains of life have effects on individual psychophysiologicalresponses. Although poorly understood from the perspectives of the materialistparadigms that have dominated Western science, the causal effects of mentaland ideological levels on the physical levels underlie the mechanisms of shaman-istic procedures. Placebo effects, total drug effects, spontaneous remissions, andother healing effects show that thoughts, expectations, and social and interper-sonal dynamics have effects on biological responses. Mental processes produce“downward causation,” eliciting biological and physical processes (e.g., the useof symbols or intentionality causing variation in biological functioning).The concept that subjective mental processes have direct effects on biologicalprocesses is central to the cognitive revolution of psychology that replaced thebottom-up determinism of positivist materialist science. This emergent interac-tionist perspective illustrates how higher mental levels have effects on the physicalfoundations from which they emerge (Sperry 1993). This approach is fundamen-tal to shamanism, which evolved to facilitate an engagement of the effects ofbeliefs and meaning on physiological responses, using rituals to affect well-being.The influence on physiology by the use of symbols reflects some of the most far-reaching implications of shamanic consciousness for the materialist paradigms ofWestern science and biomedicine. These causal effects of the mental and culturallevels on the biological levels of human existence are manifested in the generalstress-and-adaptation syndrome, hex death, psychoneuroimmunology, placeboeffects, and total drug responses. Explicating the psycho-socio-physiologicallinkages underlying these phenomena requires examining the linkages of meaningto psychobiological functioning.The effects of meaning—the interpretation of events—on physiological pro-cesses have long been understood from studies of stress. The stress-induced8SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"general adaptation syndrome and its psychophysiological effects provide a basisfor explaining shamanistic healing. Psychocultural and social effects on physio-logical processes are illustrated in both ordinary and unusual physiological andbehavioral responses (e.g., hex death, spontaneous remission of disease, symboli-cally timed deaths, mourning deaths, extraordinary healing, and conscious con-trol of the autonomic nervous systemand other physiological processes [seeWinkelman 2008a]). These phenomena require a major reconceptualization oftraditional views of causation.These reconceptualizations have already been recognized in the neuroscien-ces in how the understanding of perception has shifted to a cognitive perspective(Freeman 1995, 2000). For example, in bottom-up paradigms of physical science,sensory information determines perception. But the studies of perception showotherwise: that a predisposition to see organizes the diffuse visual stimuli into sen-sations and perceptions. It is our intentional dynamics, what Freeman discusses as“macroscopic feedback messages,” that determine the data we seek as well as ourinterpretations. The macroscopic-level functions are driven by the emotionaldynamic of the limbic brain, which produces “parameters that bias the attractorlandscapes of the sensory cortices in preafference” (Freeman 2000b, 102)—ormore simply, our emotional expectations and desires select what we focus on,where we seek the input from the environment, and consequently what we processand perceive. This shift in attention to the causal effects of consciousness reflects arevolution in science in which meaning has emerged with a central causal role inwhich symbols produce physiological changes. This book uses these top-downviews of consciousness to develop a neurophenomenological approach that inte-grates the perspectives of the mystical traditions with the science of the brain.A NEUROPHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACHTO CONSCIOUSNESSThe nature of consciousness is central to long-standing questions regarding therelationships between mind and body. The neurophenomenological perspectiveused here provides a unifying approach to consciousness, deliberately integratingknowledge of the physiofunctional organization of the brain with phenomenalexperiences, providing a basis for understanding the interaction of biologicaland mental mechanisms in shamanic practices.Piaget (1969, 1971) suggested that an understanding of consciousnessrequires consideration of both: comparative (between species) mental anatomyand structures to determine the commonality in and diversity of mental struc-tures; and mental physiology, the study of mental functions. Laughlin, McManus,and d’Aquili (1992) similarly proposed that a neurophenomenological epistemol-ogy needs to address three epistemic processes or aspects: (1) phylogeneticencephalization, how the brain changes over evolution; (2) invariant patterns ofontogenetic neuropsychological development, the universal principles of growthof members of a species; and (3) the sociogenetic, the societal conditioning ofviews of the operational environment. A neurophenomenological foundation forconsciousness requires investigation of: (1) cross-species commonalities andINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS9"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"differences in the development of the information-processing functions of thebrain; and (2) the role of activity—praxis—especially the participation in varioussocially constructed states of consciousness (Winkelman 1997a). The properties ofconsciousness are derived from interrelations of brain structures with symbolicinformation and meanings. These interrelations in the production of conscious-ness necessitate a neurophenomenological approach that directly relates phenom-enal experiences to the activities that elicit neurological structures and processes.The neurophenomenological approach (e.g., Laughlin, McManus, andd’Aquili 1992) provides perspectives for explaining shamanic manifestations ofconsciousness. Recognizing that our knowledge of both the physical world andinternal experience has a common basis in constructed precepts enables consider-ation of the relationship between the classic dichotomies of objectivity and subjec-tivity, brain and mind, without creating an inseparable gap between the two. Theneurophenomenological approach is not reductionistic to either materialism ormentalism; it recognizes that the physical world is a transcendent reality and thatour knowledge and experience of it is through mediating constructs that includethe physical properties of our bodies and the mental and symbolic systems inour brains. The physical levels have their own inherent properties, but knowledgeof them reflects the structuring principles of the mental (epistemic) levels. Theseinclude the features derived from mental filtering, the mental imposition ofschemas (i.e., epistemic assumptions) for understanding the physical world.Human consciousness and the alterations of consciousness are obviouslyaffected by both biological and symbolic systems. Biological manipulations ofthe body, including drugs, sensory stimulation, and extreme physical activities,can dramatically alter consciousness and the individual’s experience of self andworld. Similarly, voluntary control of mental process and attention through sym-bols, rituals, and meditation can provoke dramatic alterations in consciousnessand biological responses. Both physiological conditions and ritual activities con-tribute to the production of shamanic consciousness. Consequently, understand-ing shamanic phenomena requires that we address both the biological basis thatproduces a substrate for ordinary consciousness as well as the effects of behaviorsand agents that similarly alter the phenomenological structures of consciousnessand lead to spiritual experiences.The neurophenomenological approach examines biology and experiencewithin a common framework of the symbolic basis of both subjective experienceand knowledge of the physical world. Observations, whether of the physical worldor of subjective experience, are based in symbolic models. By recognizing the sub-jective and symbolic foundation of what we know of material reality, we obtain acommon foundation for integrating what we experience as the division betweenthe objective and the subjective worlds, using a hypothetical materialism and anidealist epistemology (Winkelman 1997a).Operational and Cognized EnvironmentsTo distinguish transcendent reality from our experience of the world, Laughlinet al. (1992) employed Rappaport’s (1984) termsoperational environmentand10SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"cognized environment, respectively. The operational environment is the worldindependent of human knowledge or representation of it (Kantiannoumena). Wedo not perceive this external or operational world, reality as it is. Rather we experi-ence symbols in the patterns of neural activity, which depend on the interaction ofphysiological systems with the cultural programs and epistemic assumptionsacquired for processing the external world. What we know of the operational worldis a cognized environment or model, a consequence of enculturated processing ofinformation from the operational world. We ordinarily experience our models,not the environment itself; our perceptions are generally limited to our culturallycognized environments, which are necessarily incomplete and contain systematicbiases and errors. This structural monist perspective accepts both mind and brainas manifestations of the structures of the human organism, comprising two differ-ent views of the same reality: “[M]ind is how brain experiences its own function-ing, and brain provides the structure of the mind....” “ ‘[S]piritual’ awareness isone way of knowing the being; ‘physical’ awareness is another way of knowingthe being” (Laughlin et al. 1992, 13, 11). Neither the biological sciences nor thespiritual disciplines alone provide a complete explanation or representation ofreality. A neurophenomenological approach integrates these perspectives, a recog-nition of the roles of biology in structuring experience, as well as of consciousnessin organizing biological activities.Understanding this constructed nature of perception of reality requires learn-ing about the operations of the human brain—a part of the operational environ-ment and a physical structure of the organism responsible for producing thebehaviors and experiences that constitute evidence of consciousness. Conscious-ness is what is represented to the organism, its models of the cognized environ-ments, both external and internal. These cognized models are biologicallystructured, which provides the underlying features of the universals of shamanismand other aspects of religious belief. These fundamental aspects of consciousnessinclude the perception of the universe as populated by active causal agents thatare known as spirits.Spirits as Neurocognitive StructuresThe concept of cognized models provides a characterization of the spiritual world asa normal way of knowing the universe. This universal aspect of religion is mani-fested in the concept of animism—the postulation of intentional causal abilities tononphysical spiritual entities. Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) character-ized the shaman’s spirit world as involving a cognized environment in the samesense as we produce an organized construct of our perceptions and beliefs aboutthe operational (external) environment. The visionary level of shamanic experienceengages inherent structures that are fundamental to the construction of conscious-ness. Their manipulation enables the shaman to transform both individual andsocial states of consciousness and experiences.Spirits engage some of the most fundamental structures of consciousness—perceptions of self and others (Winkelman 2004a); these similarities foundacross cultures reflect aspects that represent inherent neurocognitive structures.INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS11"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The cognized environments of the spirit worlds represent aspects of the personthat are conceptualized in psychology and psychiatry as personality, self, id,ego, complexes, motivation, obsession, and other psychodynamic processes, aswell as other anomalous experiential phenomena not well understood withinthe frameworks of Western science. Whatever they are ultimately and ontologi-cally, spirits are experientially real; the neurophenomenological perspectiveaddress how they involve direct representations of the fundamental cognitivestructures reflecting knowledge of self, others, and nature (Winkelman 2004a).Spirit concepts play a fundamental role in representing the social world, theindividual’s social relations, and conceptions of self. Spirits and their characteris-tics provide an externalization of meanings produced by nonverbal and uncon-scious levels of the organism in symbolically representing fundamental aspects ofthe individual and social group. At this level, the difference between self and other,between ego and body, are not dissociated. The spiritual world provides mecha-nisms that enable both the shaman and the patient to engage in this primordiallevel of experience and communication that affects physiology, identity, and socialrelations.This view of the spirit world as symbolically representing aspects of the socialworld, individual psychodynamics, and their interrelationships reveals some ofthe psychotherapeutic mechanisms of shamanistic systems. The relations of thespirit world to the self and the ego are symbolic, with both the supernaturaldomain and the domain of the self entrained with common neural networks viasymbolic systems (Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili 1992). In addition to theego structures that mediate consciousness, the organism also produces a varietyof other neural networks that are outside of the ego’s experiences. These structuresfrom earlier development have been automatized and repressed, not ordinarilyentrained with the conscious ego. These structures represented in the concept ofthe spirit world can affect biological processes outside of the direct control of egoicconsciousness. The ego tends to deny its relationship to these structures, whichpredominantly function outside of consciousness as dissociated complexes. Thespirit world provides a phenomenological symbol system for representing theseinternal complexes and their relationships. Their ritual manipulation permits theshaman to emotionally transform the individual, reducing egoic structures topermit unconscious material to emerge, guided by cultural expectations in combi-nation with integrative physiological processes.Constructs of the spirit world play many important roles in representing andevoking these experiences; in mediating between body, psyche, and society; andin managing intrapsychic and psychosocial dynamics. Siikala (1978) analyzed sha-manic ritual as involving a form of role-taking in interaction with the spirit world,producing self-transformation for the patient. The shaman’s manipulation of rolesincludes adopting various personalities of the spirits, as well as providing newroles for the patient to enact. This role enactment in communication with thespirit world reflects and affects the psychodynamics of the patient, exerting effectsonemotions and emotional processes, attachments, repressed complexes, andother split-off aspects of the patient’s own identity.

Ritual communication with thespirit world involves symbolic and pre-symbolic processes that alter the relation-ship between the self and world to produce a psychological balance, catharsis,and integration.These beliefs regarding the spirit world are not the product of our rationallogical mind but something perceived intuitively and naturally. The naturalness ofspirit beliefs reflects their foundation in our natural cognitive processes, featuresof our ancient brain that provide information for consciousness. This includes anassumption of causal mechanisms underlying the events that we experience.Brain Structures and Consciousness:The Triune BrainBases for shamanic forms of consciousness are derived from the major architec-tural and functional strata of the brain and their different information-processingfunctions. While all of the major systems of the brain are involved in complexhuman behavior, specific systemic patterns of brain functioning are associated withdistinct experiential states and modes of consciousness. The relationship of brainphysiology to consciousness is illustrated through an examination of how the prin-cipal physical structures of the brain and their associated functions are related topatterns of consciousness. MacLean (1973, 1990, 1993) proposed that the brainbe viewed as involving three anatomically distinct systems that provide distinctbehavioral, emotional, and informational functions; the reptilian (R-complex),paleomammalian, and neomammalian brains, respectively. MacLean’s model hasits limitations, but it is widely recognized that humans’ motor patterns, emotionalstates, and advanced cognitive and linguistic capabilities are primarily managed bybrain systems that emerged sequentially in evolution.MacLean’s model has shortcomings in that it slights the capacities of reptilesand their prototypic limbic system, and it also fails to recognize the intentionalproperties mediated by the limbic structures (Freeman 2000b). The limbic systemis central to vertebrate behavior, constituting the primary organ structure thatmediates intentionality, expectancy, achieving our purposes, fulfilling our goals,and making predictions (Freeman). MacLean’s triune brain model requires expan-sions to include a prior amphibian brain; a separate evolutionary development ofan avian brain system from the reptilian basis; and evidence of emotionality atthe reptilian level (Rial et al. 2008). Rial et al. note that, nonetheless, the triunebrain model remains as a useful framework, particularly in terms of understandingthe evolution of emotional systems, as well as “a continuity between the brains ofcurrent fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds” (Rial et al., 56).This triune brain model helps explicate the bases for different forms of con-sciousness, and how shamanic experiences are related to the ancient brain systemswe share with other animals. While all models (cognized environments) have limita-tions in describing the nature of reality (operational environment), MacLean’s triunebrain models (see Figure 1.1) provide a foundational model for understanding thenature of shamanism and the effects of the associated alterations of consciousness.INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS13"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MacLean proposed a hierarchical triune brain based on neuroanatomical,structural, and functional divisions into three strata: (1) reptilian (organic/behavioral) brain (R-complex); (2) paleomammalian (limbic/emotional) brain;and (3) neomammalian brain (frontal cortex). The three formations have dif-ferent anatomical structures that mediate different psychological and behavioralfunctions, with their own forms of subjectivity, intelligence, time and spacesense, memory capabilities, and motor functions (MacLean 1990). Althoughthe three levels are integrated, they provide the bases for a functional hierarchyof information-processing capabilities and distinct forms of consciousness.Thereptilian brain, or R-complex, is composed of the upper spinal cord andother lower brain structures extending upward to the thalamus and hypothala-mus beneath the temporal lobe (see Figure 1.2). The reptilian brain regulatesorganic functions such as metabolism, digestion, and respiration; and it is alsoresponsible for wakefulness, attentional mechanisms, and the regulation andcoordination of behavior. It is the foundation for the complex ritual behaviorsfound in reptiles; other principal functions include acquisition of food, reproduc-tion, and defense.Thepaleomammalian brainis based on evolutionary developments in thelimbic system, which MacLean suggested was the most important distinctionbetween reptiles and the mammals. MacLean apparently erred in failing to recog-nize protolimbic structures and emotions even in reptiles. But it is also clear thathe was correct in seeing the limbic structures as providing the basis for socialbehavior and nonverbal, emotional, and analogical information processing.The limbic structures function as an “emotional brain,” mediating: affect; sex;14SHAMANISMFIGURE 1.1The Triune Brain"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"fighting/self-defense; social relations, bonding, and attachment; and the sense ofself that provides the basis for beliefs, certainty, and convictions. Panksepp (1998)notes that it is in the mammals that we find the great expansion in emotions,or what he refers to as “affective cognition.”Theneomammalian brain(frontal lobes or neocortical structures) resultedfrom hominid encephalization. The neomammalian brain provides the basis foradvanced symbolic processes, culture, language, logic, rational thought, analyticalprocesses, and complex problem solving. While this level of the brain epitomizesuniquely human capabilities, the modern human brain depends heavily on pro-cesses that are primarily subcortical. “The limbic system, by virtue of its multimo-dal convergence and divergence, its control of brainstem nuclei, and its privilegedaccess to the space-time field of the brain, appears to have evolved as the mainconduit and locus of integration of neural activities into awareness” (Freeman2000, 139–140).MacLean’s proposal of the reptilian, paleomammalian, and neomammalianbrains emphasized these capacities of the limbic brain, while also pointing to thedifferent behavioral, psychological, and mental functions of each level, which helabeled protomentation, emotiomentation, and ratiomentation, respectively(MacLean 1993, 39). The protomentation processes of the reptilian brain providethe basic plots and actions of the body. The emotiomentation processes of the pale-omammalian brain provide the emotional influences on thoughts and behavior.The neomammalian brain uses enhanced symbolic capacities in elaborating onthe behavioral plots and emotiomentation of the lower brain structures, integrat-ing them with higher-level information processing. But rather than the top-downcontrol implied by this view of the neomammalian brain, Freeman (2000b) insiststhat the evidence indicates it is the limbic brain that is primarily responsible forthe higher-level integration. The meaning of a stimulus that leads to sensation rec-ognition and perceptions is based in processes of the bodily senses, emotions, andINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS15FIGURE 1.2Lobes of the Cerebrum"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"affect that are under limbic control. It is this level of the brain that remains vital tohuman intentions and experiences at the focus of shamanic activities.The Brain and Levels of ConsciousnessThe brain levels described by MacLean have homologies with major forms ofconsciousness described by Oakley (1983) and Hunt (1995a). Hunt suggestedthat the properties of consciousness are related to neural structures involving“zones of convergence” and capacities for information integration of the differentevolutionary levels of the brain. He specifically pointed to the thalamic structuresof the brain stem; the limbic system; and the tertiary neocortical area, particularlythe right hemisphere. These mirror the three brain strata of MacLean’s model.“Simple awareness” involves adaptation to the environment throughreflexes, conditioned responses, and habituation, as well as through instrumentallearning based in the confluence of peripheral sensory information in the reticu-lar formation of the upper brain stem. This aspect of consciousness is mediatedby the thalamic structures, which project to the cortical areas and trigger corticalarousal characteristic of waking consciousness (Baars 1997, 28). Baars suggestedthat the reticular formation and the thalamus are the only parts of the brainindispensable for waking consciousness. These brain stem centers central to thesleep and wakefulness cycles are very similar to those found in reptiles and otheranimals, reflecting the basis for common aspects of consciousness across verte-brate species (sleeping and waking modes of consciousness). Cory (2000) dis-cusses the functions of this level of the brain in terms of self-preservationprogramming. Damasio (1999) conceptualized a preconscious proto-self whichhas qualities and an anatomical basis that reflect MacLean’s conceptualizationof protomentation, which is discussed in Chapter 3.More complex forms of consciousness are produced by information managedthrough cognitive integration of modeling of the external environment, includingqualities of consciousness enriched by self, other (society), and emotions. Thisconsciousness is produced within a second zone of convergence, based in thelimbic system within the paleomammalian brain. This provides the basis for moredeveloped memory, derived from the coordination of different modalitiesinvolved in associational learning and based on the mammalian hippocampaland amygdala areas within the limbic system and on extended consciousnessthrough imagery of anticipation and recall. Such mammalian specializationprovided the basis for affectional programming (Cory). This level of brain devel-opment led to the evolution of capacities for successful cooperation and competi-tion with members of one’s own species. The survival value of sociality, relationswith members of one’s own species, led to the evolution of a variety of socialand cognitive capacities that enabled better prediction of the behavior of othermembers of the group. This expanded the importance of dominance andsubmission, particularly dominance hierarchies and alliances as a leading forcein successful reproduction. This focus on the intentions and future behaviors ofothers made cognitive capacities such as “mind reading” a key focus in evolution16SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of humans. The roles of the desires of others in modulating one’s own behaviormade cognition preeminently emotional.The highest forms of consciousness are based in a third zone of convergence,the tertiary neocortical area and, in particular, the right hemisphere. These are basicto symbolic cognition and self-awareness (Hunt 1995a, 74–75), providing the basisfor “self-awareness”—self-referential capacities and subjective experiences in whichthe knower focuses attention on representations of the self as an object in the world.Such neocortical capabilities are illustrated in the self-referential capabilities andcross-modal matching manifested in preverbal humans and chimpanzees. Theneomammalian brain (neocortex and connecting thalamic structures), the mostdramatic evolution of the brain, expanded consciousness through extensive inter-connections among the visual, auditory, and somatic systems. The neocortex alsoprovides the bases for other forms of consciousness through neural networks forthe portrayal of language and other symbolic activities, such as writing and arith-metic. Although these mental representations are salient aspects of consciousnessand self-awareness, the cognitive processes based in lower-brain structures persistbecause they are essential for human behavior.The modern brain operates through the integration of the instinctualresponses of the reptilian brain, the autonomic emotional states of the paleo-mammalian brain, and the cognitive processes of the neomammalian brain.These relationships are mediated physiologically and symbolically, but notprimarily through verbal language. Rather this mediation is through nonverbalforms of mentation and representation that utilize social, behavioral, and affec-tive information to mediate, evoke, and channel physiological processes.Cory notes a fundamental tension between our self-preservation drives andour affectional dynamics, where our self-interest conflicts with our commitmentto others. This tension produces a struggle between meeting our personal needsand responding to the needs of others. Shamanism addresses this conflictthrough processes that balance our self-interested and other-interested drives,our innate egocentric and empathetic tendencies.The functions of these brain structures that humans share with other animalstypically operate outside the grasp and awareness of the left-hemisphere-basedlinguistic modes of representation. These levels of the brain and their functionsnonetheless provide the basis for a complex information and intrapsychic com-munication system. These reptilian and the paleomammalian brain functionsare fundamental aspects of mentation and representation that underlie humanbehavior routines, basic personality, and the sense of self that permits socialinteraction and meaning (MacLean 1990).Protomentation and emotiomentation are primarily based in the reptilian andthe paleomammalian brains, respectively (MacLean 1993, 35). These forms ofcommunication utilize a variety of mediums (vocal, bodily, behavioral, chemical),which may be active and intentional or passive and unintentional. These nonver-bal communication processes have syntax (orderly sequences) and semantics(meaning) and are found in both animal behavioral patterns and humans’primary processing.INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS17"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The R-complex controls protomentation, the rudimentary cerebrationinvolved in an animal’s master routines, the patterns of daily activities, and theexpression of the major behavioral displays used in social communication(MacLean 1990, 12). Protomentation controls the displays (ritualizations) andthe rudimentary mental processes, as well as “propensions”—“drives, impulses,compulsions, and obsessions” (MacLean 1993, 35). The R-complex managesspecies-typical communicative behavior, particularly isopraxis (innate disposi-tions to engage in the same behavior as another member of your species) andother forms of imitation. The R-complex is key to integrating the movementsand the total reactions of the organism to communicate personal and socialmeanings. MacLean characterized the primary functions of the R-complex associal communication through the evocation of displays—animal “rituals.” Thislevel of the brain represents patterns of meaning isomorphically in their interre-lated physiological, behavioral, and social dynamics.The Paleomammalian Brain and EmotiomentationEmotiomentation (or emotional mentation) involves brain and mental processesunderlying affects, subjective information derived from associations with feelings.Emotiomentation influences behavior, particularly that pertinent to self-preservation, procreation, and other socioemotional dynamics. The primarybrain system underlying emotiomentation is the paleomammalian brain (limbicsystem), which includes the hippocampus, which is the source of convergenceof exteroceptive and interoceptive neurotransmission, synthesizing internal andexternal sensory information and influencing the hypothalamus and other brainstructures responsible for memory, emotions, self-representation, and socialbehavior. The paleomammalian brain provides the basis for the three principalbehavioral developments in the evolution from reptiles to mammals: (1) nursingand maternal care; (2) audiovocal contact developed from maintaining maternal-offspringcontact;and(3)play(MacLean1990,16).Thesesetthebasisforthefamily, social attachments, enactments, and symbolic meaning. The limbic sys-tem expanded considerably in higher mammals, meeting the primary functionsof the modulation of affect to guide behavior; it also has an important role indreaming. Limbic functions are “essential for a sense of personal identity andreality that have far-reaching implications for ontology and epistemology”(248). MacLean (1990) suggested that the paleomammalian brain plays a vitalrole in higher cognitive functions, including manifestations of the basic socialpersonality. The limbic system plays a vital role in subjective apperception, usingfeelings to guide self- and species-preservation behavior. Limbic system controlof the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in eliciting emotionalmentation and in transforming it into physiological effects. This affective andsymbolic manipulation of these physiological processes can have profound effectson the organism, for example, provoking physiological changes when the organ-ism is confronted with situations that threaten survival and interpersonal attach-ments. “Short of inducing physical exercise, emotional mentation represents theonly form of psychological information that may provoke marked, and often18SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"prolonged, physiological changeswithinthe organism” (MacLean 1990, 23). Bothphysical exercise (e.g., dancing, clapping) and the ritual manipulation of emo-tions are fundamental to shaman healing, ritually engaging the opioid systemand its powerful motivating and reinforcing effects.Emotions also affect others’ behaviors through the interpretations theymodel. The fundamental roles of emotions in human learning and developmentare revealed in the dynamics of child-mother/caretaker interactions. Empathiccaring is an evolutionary adaptation, a manifestation of the co-evolution of thepaleomammalian brain and of family and social relations. The long-termdependence of infants on adults for survival required adaptations, such as thedevelopment of attachment behaviors, as well as smiles, kissing, caressing, andother intimate social behaviors. Feelings of attachment, emotional security, andidentity with family provided the basis for the eventual extension of such rela-tions to nonkin, strangers, and the broader social and religious realms. Theserelations and sense of self also provide the basis for a variety of health problemsderived from emotions elicited in social interaction.Shamanistic healing practices are centrally concerned with the management ofthese emotions, sense of self, and social relations, utilizing ritual for therapeuticinterventions in the processes of the paleomammalian brain. These processes thatintegrate different sources of information to assess their significance for theorganism’s well-being provide the physiological basis for shamanistic healing.The relationship of innate drives and needs and social influences constitutes thematrix for many different kinds of health problems—chronic anxiety and fears,behavioral disorders, conflicts, excessive emotionality or desires, obsessions andcompulsions, dissociations, repression, and so forth. Processes that are subneo-cortical, based in prelinguistic symbolic modalities and affective associations, con-strue these problems and self-constructs through processes primarily involving theright hemisphere and the paleomammalian brain. These aspects of consciousnessplay a crucial role in providing the sense of unity of assurance and conviction vitalfor self and species survival (Ashbrook 1993). This sense of self and personal well-being is deeply intertwined with a sense of “communitas,” a sense of social identityin which empathy with other humans provides the basis for self and security.Shamanic rituals engage innate social signaling mechanisms that promote a senseof community and enhance cooperation—physically, socially, and mentally—inways that enhance human adaptation and survival. The paleomammalian brainproduces and uses expressions of the face, vocalizations, actions, and gestures thatprovide information about others’ minds and their motives and internal states,creating a common or collective awareness, which is the basis of consciousness.These nonverbal communicative behaviors and processes have not becomeobsolete in humans, but rather have been elaborated along with the developmentof verbal language (Bateson 1972). These earlier communication systems are stillmanifested in art, music, theater dance, facial expressions, and poetry, reflectingtheir continued importance in human communication. The discourse of thisnonverbal communication is primarily about the self and its emotional states inrelationships to others. Bateson (1972) suggested that dreams are a context in whichthese earlier forms of representation persist, depicting the relationship of theINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS19"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"dreamer to his or her world. But although dreams operate in metaphor, Batesonsuggested that they lack the capacity for metacommunication, a consequence ofthe lack of the reference to self and social context in dreams. But the utilization ofdreams for representation in shamanic practices supersedes these limitations. Thisis achieved through analogical and metaphoric representations based in a visualand corporeal capacity, an imagestic form of presentational symbolism thatcombines images with memories and bodily sensations to produce a new form ofself-awareness.Human consciousness is experienced through a number of different modal-ities, which are all fundamentally symbolic in nature (Laughlin, McManus, andd’Aquili 1992). Hunt (1995a&b&c) distinguished two fundamental modalities ofsymbolic cognition involving a self-referential capacity, which he referred to asrepresentational symbolism and presentational symbolism. In contrast to linguis-tically based forms of representational symbolism, Hunt characterized presenta-tional symbolism as derived from cross-modal translation, a fusion of the sensesof vision, hearing, and touch-movement (Hunt 1995c, 410, 416). This presenta-tional symbolism also constitutes the basic form for awareness within nonsym-bolic organisms, including human children; the presentational is prior to therepresentational. With presentational symbolism, the visual medium is focal,and a polysemic meaning emerges out of the unconscious. The meaning of presen-tational symbolism appears to emerge directly and spontaneously in images.Images can also provide knowledge beyond that embedded in propositionalknowledge, particularly as illustrated in dream imagery, which has meaningbeyond that found within waking symbolic consciousness. Dreams are coded com-munications to be interpreted in a process of exploring the images in relationshipto our feelings and social relations.CONSCIOUSNESS AND ALTERED STATES OFCONSCIOUSNESS: A RECONCEPTUALIZATIONThe concept of altered states of consciousness (ASC) as a topic for legitimate scien-tific inquiry emerged in the 1960s, albeit not without a lot of controversy. Amongthe many figures who contributed to this emerging field was Charles Tart (e.g.,1975, 1977). His influential books and edited volumes contributed to the forma-tion of an implicit paradigm of ASC that has remained for decades. This paradig-matic framework for altered consciousness is explicitly linked to the concepts ofordinary consciousness, conceptualized as follows (Tart 1977):states of consciousness (SoC);discrete states of consciousness (d-SoC);baseline state of consciousness (b-SoC); andaltered states of consciousness (a-SoC, or ASC).Tart definedstates of consciousnessas conditions that differ qualitatively fromothers by the presence of conditions or characteristics that are absent in other states.20SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"States of consciousness represent how people judge usual alterations in experienceand are identified by the individual’s assessment of patterns of experience.Discretestates of consciousnessare unique dynamic patterns, configurations, or systems ofpsychological structures or subsystems. These patterns, in interaction, stabilizeeach other’s functioning and actively maintain a constant overall pattern of func-tioning and identity across varying environments. Different states may involvedifferent biological responses, but the characteristics are determined by personalsignificance.The personal significance of an individual’s SoC is of less importance toscience than are the underlying biological dynamics that give both similarity toSoC across people and regular differences in SoC across people and cultures. Whatis most significant about the so-called ASC is not simply that they have personalsignificance, but that they have special forms of significance that transcend bothpersonal and cultural factors—they are reflective of realms that are transpersonaland transcultural. These factors point to their biological foundations. This notionof an underlying cross-culturally valid biological basis for the general dynamics ofaltered consciousness did not figure significantly in this paradigm of ASC. ButTart’s pioneering work also pointed to the reality of altered consciousness thatinvolves something transcendental, a set of significant human conditions thatmust be understood with respect to their own intrinsic properties. Tart’s (1972)groundbreaking article on the concept of state-specific sciences foreshadowedthe perspective suggested below that characterizes altered consciousness in episte-mological terms, as specific forms of knowing.To understand these transcendental dimensions of consciousness we need aframework that goes beyond Tart’s (1977, 192) conceptualization of ASC interms of differences from the baseline state of consciousness (b-SoC), “an activestable overall patterning of psychological functions that, via multiple (feedback)stabilization relationships among the parts making it up, maintains its identityin spite of environmental changes.” The ASC paradigm takes the ordinary aspectsof consciousness as the framework for conceptualizing the significant aspects ofASC. But what are these major differences with respect to baseline consciousness?And if we take an approach based on the intrinsic properties of these forms ofaltered consciousness, what would our conceptualization of these conditionsreveal? I propose that the answer lies in understanding altered consciousnesswithin the broader frameworks of the biological and epistemological foundationsof consciousness in general. This neurophenomenological approach proposesthat we conceptualize consciousness first in relationship to several biologicalfunctional modes of operation that we share with other organisms such aswaking, deep sleep, and dreams. And, secondly, that we understand waking andaltered or integrative consciousness in terms of neuroepistemic systems, biocul-tural processes for knowing.Modes of ConsciousnessSimilarities in manifestations of consciousness across species and cultures reflectcommon underlying biological structures, a manifestation of the systemicINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS21"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"organization of the brain. These biologically structured foundations are discussedasmodesof consciousness. Amode of consciousnessis a biologically based func-tional system of organismic operation that reflects conditions of homeostatic bal-ance among brain subsystems to meet global organismic needs. Different modesof consciousness are revealed in the congruencies in the primary daily patternsof variation in behavior and experiences of humans and other animals. We sharewith other animals the daily cycles of sleep and waking, with homologous brainstructures responsible for these patterns. And with most other mammals, weshare the mode of consciousness of dreaming. The biological bases of themodes of consciousness are revealed in the recurrent patterns of systemicneurophysiological functioning and their homologies with the major differencesin experience. The transcendent natureof these modes is indicated by theirpresence in other animals and in the congruence of the biophysiological andmystical approaches in recognition of four fundamental conditions or modesof consciousness:1. waking consciousness,2. deep sleep,3. REM (rapid eye movement) sleep (dreaming), and4. a spiritual, transpersonal, or transcendental consciousness, an integrativeconsciousness.These four modes of human consciousness reflect fundamental aspects ofsystemic organismic function and balance. The different modes of consciousnessare based on the differential activation and integration of different functionalsystems and information-processing capabilities of the organism. These modesare so basic to the operation of brains that they are functionally wired in multipleways into the brain’s structures. This multiply managed organization of modes ofconsciousness is illustrated in the brain’s control of dreaming. No single region ofthe brain is entirely responsible for the initiation of REM sleep; apparently theredoes not exist a “REM sleep center” (Graham 1990), but independently actinggroups of cells are responsible for different specific aspects of REM sleep(also see Alkire and J. Miller [2005]; Hobson [2005]; and Sutton, Mamelak, andHobson [1992] for general neural correlates of sleep and unconsciousness).REM sleep periods may begin as a consequence of a “committee” decision madeby interconnected neural groups simultaneously reaching critical levels of activ-ity, with a number of interlinked areas involved in REM production. Studies alsoshowed that the excision of most sites involved with sleep and dream functionresulted in only partial or transient sleep disturbances and the persistence of sleepand waking cycles in the absence of what were considered required anatomicalstructures (McGinty 1985).Different modes of consciousness involve a differential entrainment of bio-logical, personal, social, and cultural information-processing functions. Althoughlearning and cultural factors produce some variance in the manifestation of themodes of consciousness, their patterns reflect underlying biological functionsand organismic needs. Individuals are bound to certain cycles of biologically22SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"based alteration in the modes of consciousness (e.g., deep sleep, dreams, andwaking), but cultures produce variabilityin terms of the specific states andcontents of consciousness within modes.The four different modes of consciousness—waking, deep sleep, dream, andintegrative consciousness—reflect fundamental aspects of systemic functioningof the human organism that meet the following system functions and needs,respectively:•learning, adaptation, and food and other survival needs (waking);•recuperative functions, regeneration, and growth (deep sleep);•memory integration and consolidation and psychosocial adaptation(dreaming); and•psychodynamic growth and social and psychological integration (integrative).It is noteworthy that not just the waking mode but also the dream and integra-tive mode of consciousness are recognized as having the potential for some forms ofawareness that constitute consciousness. Furthermore, while deep sleep is generallyconsidered unconscious, or not-conscious, meditative traditions have emphasizedthe ability to develop consciousness during dreams and deep sleep as well.Reconceptualizing States of Consciousnesswithin ModesTart’s baseline and altered states of consciousness are reconceptualized here as thewaking and integrative modes of consciousness, respectively. The waking mode ofconsciousness is the biological frame of reference for relating to the world and thesystem within which organisms function behaviorally. Tart’s other states of con-sciousness reflect variable conditions that occur within all modes of conscious-ness. Because SoC differ in terms of personal significance or psychologicalsubsystems, they are a subsidiary level of analysis to that of modes, which arederived from physiological processes. Modes of consciousness are biologicallybased, and their functions are related to organismic needs and homeostatic bal-ance. The differences in states of consciousness reflect sociocultural learning andpsychosocial needs. States operate within modes, with the specific characteristicsof states determined by the social, cultural, and psychological effects rather thanby the strictly biological needs. Modes, states, and phases of consciousness arenested levels of analysis for the bioorganismic structural, phenomenological, andcognized aspects of consciousness. Modes include several states of consciousness,which are characterized by cyclic phases. Different states of consciousness arefound within each of the modes of consciousness—sleep, dreaming, waking, andintegrative. Different cultures produce different types of stable states of conscious-ness within the integrative mode of consciousness, but these often reflect specificdynamics found cross-culturally (e.g., soul flight, possession).The differences in the level of organization implied by modes versus states ofconsciousness are illustrated by the number of discrete states of consciousnessINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS23"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"within the waking mode of consciousness. For example, during the waking modeof consciousness, a person may experience qualitatively different states of con-sciousness: driving a car, reading a book, eating, having sex, and daydreaming.The sleep and dream modes of consciousness also include different SoC withinthem. These have been referred to as “stages” in the context of recursive variationsin the activities occurring during sleep (Dement and Mitler 1974). During themodes of deep sleep and dreams, a variety of SoC may emerge, known as patho-logical states such as somnambulism, nocturnal automatisms, sleep drunkenness,sleep terrors, and hypnagogic states. The integrative mode of consciousness alsohas a number of states of consciousness (e.g., soul flight, possession,samadhi) thatare referred to collectively as ASC. Subsidiary to the level of states of consciousnessare other conditions, characterized by Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) asphases and warps of consciousness, whichrepresent, respectively, distinct cog-nized episodes of experience and the transition between them (Laughlin,McManus, and d’Aquili 1992).Phasesreflect a more detailed differentiation ofthe patterns of internal variation within a specific state of consciousness, a discreteand repetitive pattern of experiences. The attentional structures of waking con-sciousness are programmed by culture, socializing members to a selective rangeof potential experiences. Personal consciousness reflects cultural programmingof the development, automatization, and inhibition of awareness/attention. Thisproduces phases reflecting the cyclic reentrainment and sequential coordinationof neural network activity, producing distinct cognized episodes of experience.This involves the repetitive engagement of specific neural systems into the con-scious network, reproducing a previous experience that contributes to producinga series of overall stable organizations of the psyche—discrete states and phaseswithin the waking mode of consciousness.Warpsare experiential and neural transformations (Laughlin et al. 1992, 141)that produce the transition between two different modes or states of conscious-ness. The hypnagogic warp occurs between the waking phase and the sleep phase.The hypnopompic warp occurs between the dream phase and the waking phase.Warps normally pass so quickly that they are normally unconscious to the subject(e.g., one is seldom aware of the point of falling asleep). One may control orenhance consciousness by directing attention to the previous warp, but the shiftthrough the sleep-dream-waking cycle or modes involves a series of warps thatoperate largely outside of consciousness. Warps of consciousness are most widelyrecognized in the ritualized procedures for altering consciousness and enteringsome state within the integrative mode of consciousness.Control of phases, states, and modes of consciousness can be achieved byexercising control over warps and by entraining structural aspects of neural func-tioning normally outside of awareness. Ritual is one way used to exercise controlover the operating structures of consciousness (Laughlin et al. 1992). Shamanismuses technologies to induce warps in consciousness to access different modes andstates. Shamanistic practices utilize nighttime ritual activities and dream incuba-tion to reduce the barriers to awareness of these experiences on return to the wak-ing mode of consciousness. Production of warps in consciousness is central toshamanic practices and access to the IMC.24SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"BIOLOGICAL BASES OF THE INTEGRATIVEMODE OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe conditions of altered consciousness are not merely some variant of ordinarywaking consciousness, but reflect the operation of a different aspect of humannature. A number of investigators have proposed that many different ritual alter-ations of consciousness involve similar brain responses. Davidson (1976) pro-posed that common physiological mechanisms involved a manipulation of thedivisions of the autonomic nervous system, an extensive ergotropic (sympa-thetic) activation leading to a collapse into a trophotropic (parasympathetic)dominant state. Consequently, a general feature of altered consciousness involvesrelaxation and a slowing of the brain wave patterns. These more synchronizedand coherent slow brain wave discharges accompany the parasympathetic-dominant state. These altered consciousness episodes are also characterized byan integration of the various levels of the brain. This integration is manifestedin entrainment of the frontal cortex byhighly coherent and synchronizedslow-wave discharges emanating from the limbic system and related lower-brain structures. These entrainments may occur at a variety of frequencies, buta predominant pattern is primarily in the slow-wave theta bands (3–6 cyclesper second).These processes provide the basis for the conceptualization of altered con-sciousness as anintegrativemode of consciousness, reflecting principles foundin both biological and phenomenological bases. Neurological perspectives showphysiological integration as manifested in brain wave synchronization and coher-ence and reflected in the experiences of various forms of integrative cognitionand experience. The biological foundation for these experiences is reflected intheir production by a wide variety of natural agents (i.e., psychedelic drugs) andritual procedures (i.e., trauma, extreme fasting, and exertion) that elicit system-atic brain discharge patterns that propagate across the neuraxis of the brain,producing brain wave synchronization.This paradigm of integrative consciousness originates in the work of Mandell(1980), who suggested that physiological mechanisms underlying “transcendentstates” are based in a common underlying neurobiochemical pathway involvingthe temporal lobe. Mandell suggested that the neurobiological basis underlyingecstatic and transcendent feelings, including their ineffable and religious compo-nents, involves a “biogenic amine-temporal-lobe limbic neurology...based inthe mesolimbic serotonergic pathway that extends from the median raphe nucleusin the mesencephalon, coexistent with part of the mesencephalic reticular forma-tion regulating arousal...to the septum and hippocampus” (381, 390). Manyagents and procedures produce a loss of serotonin inhibition of the hippocampalCA3 cells, which results in an increase in the cells’ activity and the manifestation ofhippocampal-septal slow-wave frequency discharges. This slow-wave EEG activity(alpha, theta, and delta, especially 3–6 cps theta) imposes a synchronous slow-wave pattern on the frontal lobes. This produces slow-wave hypersynchronousdischarges across the hippocampal-septal-reticular-raphe circuit that link theR(reptilian)-complex and paleomammalian brain. Agents and procedures thatINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS25"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"invoke this pattern include hallucinogens, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana,polypeptide opiates, long-distance running, hunger, thirst, sleep loss, auditorystimuli such as drumming and chanting, sensory deprivation, dream states,meditation, and a variety of psychophysiological imbalances or sensitivitiesresulting from injury, trauma, disease, or hereditarily transmitted nervous systemconditions.Mandell proposed that the hippocampus is the focal point of the mechanismsthat reduce the inhibitory serotonin regulation of temporal lobe limbic function.The loss of inhibitory regulation by serotonin results in hyperexcitability of theCA3 cells and reduction or loss of the cells’ role in the “gating” of emotionalresponse. This loss of gating, combined with the hippocampal-septal synchronousdischarges, result in an emotional flooding—ecstasy (paraphrase, Mandell 1980,400). The loss of hippocampal CA3 modulation removes regulatory input fromthe environment, leaving the “inside world” dominant.The hippocampal-septal system is an association area involved in the forma-tion and the mediation of memory andemotions. The hippocampal formationinfluences the hypothalamus and otherbrain structures responsible for self-preservation, family-related behavior (MacLean 1990), and the management ofnovel sensory information. The synchronous patterns originating in thehippocampal-septal-reticular raphe circuits reflect linkages of the attentionalmechanisms in the behavioral brain regions (reticular formation) and the emo-tional brain (limbic brain, particularly the hippocampal-septal area). These repeti-tive responses produce synchronous electrical discharges that propagate up themajor axon bundles from the base of the brain into the frontal cortex, imposingthese discharges from our ancient levels of the brain into the frontal lobes.Drugs and the Integrative Mode of ConsciousnessThe worldwide association of plant drugs that profoundly alter consciousnesswith religious and spiritual activities (see de Rios [1984], Schultes and Hofmann[1979]; Ra ̈tsch [2005]) points to intrinsic relationships among the innate proper-ties of our neurotransmission systems and the origins of religious experience.Spiritual traditions worldwide consider substances that are exogenous sourcesof neurotransmitters to be the origin of their most important deities and the rea-son for their spiritual and consciousness-transforming practices. An explanationof the origins of religious practices, and shamanism in particular, must addressthe roles of these external sources of altered consciousness that are at the coreof many spiritual traditions, showing the relationships of these agents to thefunctions of the brain systems that are activated.The differences between drug and nondrug alterations of consciousness aregenerally presumed to be so obvious that their common substrate is not consid-ered. But the phenomenological similarities of drug-induced and natural mysti-cal experiences was illustrated in the double-blind study by Griffiths et al.(2006), which showed that psilocybin produced the characteristic features foundin naturally induced mystical experiences. The relationships among natural and26SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"drug-induced alterations of consciousness must be understood from an evolu-tionary perspective. This reveals altered consciousness to be related to endog-enous mechanisms that are triggered by both ancient evolutionary adaptationsand more recently acquired propensities to use exogenous sources of substancesto alter consciousness. Reconceptualizing plant “toxins” as “rewards” in terms ofeffects on behavior, emotions, and cognition reframes this human attraction asan adaptation involving an enhanced ability to use exogenous sources of impor-tant endogenous neurotransmitter substances that have a profound effect onhuman consciousness.Sullivan and Hagen (2002) review evidence of a long-term evolutionaryrelationship between psychotropic plant substances and humans’ cognitivecapacities that indicate there were selective benefits of their use. Sullivan, Hagen,and Hammerstein (2008) point to a variety of forms of evidence that drug plantswere part of ancient environmental exposures that resulted in human’s evolutionof counter-measures to plant defenses, processes that enabled us to benefit fromtheir neurotransmitter sources without suffering from their toxic defenses. Theycharacterize these benefits as derived from the ability of plants to provide neuro-transmitter analogues that served as substitutes for endogenous neurotransmit-ters that are rare or otherwise limited by dietary constraints. These are primarilyin the monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, as wellas acetylcholine and norepinephrine, which are crucial for normal brain functionand require dietary precursors. These neurotransmitters are central to managingstress, exerting a selective pressure for a metabolic system that can use theseexogenous sources of precursors of valuable neurotransmitters, particularly theopioids, dopamine and serotonin (see Figure 1.3).INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS27FIGURE 1.3Major Neural Pathways in the Brain"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Both dopamine and serotonin are key to understanding the alterations ofconsciousness found worldwide in shamanistic traditions. Dopamine and sero-tonin are the two most important neurotransmitter amines and play complemen-tary roles in balancing the functions of the brain and body (Previc 2009). “[T]heserotonergic inhibition of dopamine release is arguably the clinically most impor-tant neurochemical interaction in the brain...particularly in the ventromedialand limbic subcortical and cortical areas” (Previc 2009, 21). The right hemisphereand its serotonergic and noradrenergic systemsinhibit the left hemisphere anddopamine. Psychedelic plants have the capacity to interfere with these regulatoryfunctions of serotonin, releasing functions of the dopamine system.Dopamine and Altered ConsciousnessA central feature of the neural transmitter systems involved in altered conscious-ness is the dopamine system, which is stimulated by an enormous variety of bothendogenous and environmental chemicals (Previc 2009). Previc proposes thatthe human drive to seek ASCs directly involves the dopamine system, which isinhibited by serotonin, and indirectly disinhibitedby the psychedelics. Whilethe diverse neurochemistry underlying psychedelics might appear to contradictthe model of a common neural substrate for ASC, Previc argues for a commonneurochemical profile across the numerous different neurotransmitters involved.He proposes that the diverse drugs thatalter consciousness ultimately lead toelevated levels of dopamine in the brain. Common to ASCs is a disinhibition ofdopaminergic extrapersonal brain systems, particularly those involving ventralcortex and the limbic circuit that runs from the medial temporal lobe to theventral striatum (Previc 2009; Vollenweider and Geyer 2001).Evolutionary approaches to abusive use of drugs have generally focused onthe reward and reinforcement effects they have on the dopamine system; virtuallyall classes of drugs (including alcohol, nicotine, stimulants, and tetrahydrocanna-binol [THC]) have effects on dopamine transmission in the limbic system, as wellas on serotonergic transmission (Mandel 1980; Smith and Tasnadi 2007). Theeffects of endogenous opioids on dopaminergic transmission closely resemblesthose of alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine, opiates, and THC (Smithand Tasnadi 2007). Although they act through a variety of intermediary systems(serotonin, enkephalins, GABA), acute exposure to the major categories of drugsof abuse results in increases in dopaminergic activity, specifically in the hippo-campus and nucleus accumbens (Smith 1999).Endogenous opioids is a general term referring to a class of natural substan-ces in the body that include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins, and otheropiate-like substances (Smith and Tasnadi 2007) that interact with the dopaminesystem. These substances, particularlyβ-endorphin, are functionally identical(analogues) to the opiates found in plants, which have the capacity to interactwith the same neurotransmitter sites in our brains. The endorphins are also adap-tations for reducing pain and stress and enhancing learning and memory. Theuniquely human activity of long-distance running produces enhanced release ofendorphins, extending the capacities of such extreme physical activity that was28SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"adaptive in flight from predators with the pain-numbing effects, facilitating theability to continue to flee rather than succumb to pain, muscle cramps, shortnessof breath, and so on (Jones 2005).The effects on dopamine receptors are typically characterized as producing apleasurable response that reinforces behaviors that favor successful adaptation,such as food and sex. In addition to the naturally pleasurable effects, opioidsreduce pain avoidance and sexual behavior, and increase eating. The mesolimbicdopamine system and its rewarding properties and mediation of pleasures fromnatural rewards (food, sex) decline when the dopaminergic system is suppressedor impaired (Barbano and Cader 2007). Salamone and Correa (2002) refined thisview in proposing that it is the dopamine system that attributes incentive qual-ities to a reward, potentiating the organism’s associated responses. Humans’potential for addiction belongs to the same reward system that produces thepowerful experiences of altered consciousness in spiritual traditions found world-wide, and reflects the importance of such experiences to the human condition.Although dopamine is associated with sex and other pleasurable states, itdoes not appear to have a central role in emotional arousal in general or socialwarmth and empathy, which instead depend on serotonin, norepinephrine(NE), opioids, and oxytocin (Previc 2009). In fact, high levels of dopamine leadto emotional detachment. The human dopamine system must be contextualizedin broad evolutionary terms as part of our mammalian heritage, with similareffects across mammalian species in social bonding, from mother-infant bondsto broader social groups. The endogenous opioids that stimulate our rewardand learning systems also have core functions in the mammalian brain and itsemotional, social, and self-systems, especially breastfeeding and bonding.Sullivan, Hagen, and Hammerstein suggest that the central role of these substan-ces in the mesolimbic dopamine system indicates that we should also understandthe broader functions of the opioids in regulation of attention, the integration ofsensorimotor behavior, and modification of behavioral programs. Previc (2009)reviews evidence that dopamine is also vital for all of the key functions ofadvanced intelligence and cognition, including programming and executingmotor planning, working memory and the capacity for parallel processing, spatialand temporal abstraction, and mental set shifting. These dopamine effects involvea number of cognitive processes fundamental to the emergence of the modernhuman psyche and our orientations to extrapersonal space, times and placesdistant from our immediate presence. Previc implicates the role of dopamine ina variety of cognitive abilities crucial to these forms of advanced human cogni-tion, including stimulus associations, exploratory behavior, motivation, goal-directedness, reward prediction, cognitive shifting, abstract representation, andprocesses linked to generativity and creativity (Previc 1999, 2009).Previc notes that all of these higher cognitive functionsare concerned withprocessing of information regarding events in distal space and time. Dopamineappears central to understanding causal and temporal relationships and to placingour awareness and focus of attention outside of the immediate space and presenttime. Dopaminergic circuits are active during exploration of novelty and rewardlearning and motivate prolonged effort for delayed gratification and pursuit ofINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS29"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"goal-directed responses. The abilities for context-independent cognition areexemplified in the capacities for “off-line thinking” and “mental time travel,”the ability to experience and think about things other than those in the here andnow. “In essence, ventromedial dopaminergic activation results in the ‘triumph’of extrapersonal brain activity over the body systems that anchor our self-concept and our body orientation as well as a triumph over the more ‘rational’executive intelligence maintained in the lateral dopaminergic systems” (Previc2009, 53). “The predominance of dopamine in association with cortical areas, inwhich higher order sensory processing or cross-modal sensory interactions occurindicates that dopamine is especially well-suited to making connection amongstimuli and events and organizing them into mental plans. This is beneficial instimulating creativity and in ‘off-line’ thinking and strategizing, importantcomponents of abstract reasoning” (Previc 2009, 30).Dopamine’s central role in the integrative functions of the prefrontal cortex(PFC)isextendedthroughoutthebrainasthenervoussystemthatallowsthePFC to connect to other cortical regions. The major dopaminergic systemsoriginate in the midbrain area within the mesolimbic system and its numerousconnections to other limbic structures and the frontal cortex. These midbrainand brainstem areas are the most important motivational system and contain cellbodies that produce a wide range of neurotransmitters and extend to all of theregions of the cortex. Dopaminergic activation produces the integrative dynamicscharacteristic of the IMC.Disinhibition and DeregulationThis paradigm of integrative brain states as a generic feature underlying alteredconsciousness is illustrated in the research of Vollenweider (1998) on the mecha-nisms of action of psychedelics on the major cortical loops. The frontal-subcortical circuits provide one of the principal organizational networks of thebrain (Cummings 1993). They involve five parallel segregated loops and feedbackloops of neuronal circuits that link the cortical areas of the frontal brain with thethalamus of the brain stem region. These loops linking the frontal cortex withlower brain regions (basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and thalamus) are centralto brain-behavior relationships, mediating motor activity, social actions, motiva-tions, and executive functions. These frontal-striatal-cortico circuits underliemotivated actions and emotions by monitoring information which pass throughthe thalamus (the primary filter). Deficits in these frontal-subcortical circuits arekeys to a wide range of psychological disorders (Cummings).Vollenweider’s findings implicate the consciousness-altering properties ofpsychedelics as involving selective deficit effects on the brain’s CSTC (cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical) feedback loops. These loops are the principal organiza-tional networks of the brain, linking the information-gating systems of lowerlevels of the brain (basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and thalamus) with the frontalcortex. These loops are regulated at lower levels of the brain in the thalamus,which limits the ascending information. Psychedelics produce disturbances ordeficits in the CSTC loops. The disinhibition of the lower brain systems by the30SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"psychedelics floods the frontal cortex with information, leading to breakdown ofthe integrative capacity of the ego. This increased information from the lowerbrain systems can overwhelm the frontal cortex and lead to an alteration of expe-rience of self and the internal world of psychological structures and projections.The emergence of these unconscious dynamics increases because of the disablingor deafferentation of the brain structures supporting egoic consciousness.Altered Consciousness as Deregulationof the Prefrontal CortexThe hypothesis of alterations of consciousness as disruption of processes of thefrontal cortex is also proposed by Dietrich (2003), who noted that a variety ofASC involve a temporary deregulation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Psycho-logical and neurological studies illustrate that endurance running, dreaming,hypnosis, drug-induced states, and meditation share commonalities in theirdisruption of the higher order functions associated of the PFC. This disruptionis manifested in the loss of highly integrated aspects of neural informationprocessing and higher cognitive functions. The various agents and activities thatlead to this deregulation (extensive exercise, food-deprivation, induced dream-ing, drugs, meditation) do so in distinct ways that contribute to different kindsof ASC experiences and their unique phenomenological characteristics. Underly-ing these differences, however, are significant commonalities that constitute thephysiological dynamics of the integrative mode of consciousness that derive notjust from a deregulation of the frontal cortex but also the manifestation of otherbrain structures usually repressed by frontal activities. Dietrich’s transient hypo-frontality theory postulates that ASCs result when higher level brain functionsof the cortical regions and the prefrontal cortex are down-regulated. This inhibi-tion happens in part through the serotonin disinhibition of the dopaminesystem. The action in down-regulating the PFC allows a number of unusualself-experiences because the normal sense of self is deactivated, allowing for theemergence of aspects of identity related to our more ancient brain functions.Dietrich (2003) proposed that the lack of engagement of the PFC results in thelack of certain frontal lobe qualities—willful action, self-awareness, the deliberatedirection of attention, abstract and creative thought, and planning. However, sha-manic soul journeys and many meditative states retain those properties, requiringan explanation of how these capacities persist in the absence of prefrontal functions.D’Aquili and Newberg (1999) also note enhanced PFC activity in meditation.Hypnosis as Integration and DissociationSelection for a biological disposition to these highly focused internal statesof awareness is illustrated by the genetic basis for hypnotic susceptibility, whichalso reflects limbic-frontal integration characterized by theta wave discharge pat-terns (Crawford 1994). In noting the substantial similarities between shamanicand hypnotic experiences in spite of the very different contexts, Carden ̃a (1996)proposes that the alterations in consciousness found in shamanism and deepINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS31"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"hypnosis are likely the product of the same innate biological and cognitive dispo-sitions. Crawford reviewed research illustrating the neurophysiological basis forhypnosis. Highly hypnotizable people have attentional filtering mechanisms thatfunction more strongly, enabling them to sustain attention with better focus andto ignore irrelevant environmental stimuli. Their renowned ability to focus on aninternally generated environment reflects a fundamental characteristic of theshaman’s visionary experience.The features of hypnosis also reveal the reciprocal side of integration, that ofdissociation. In order to have a highly focused attention, there must be a reduc-tion of attention to distracters. The highly integrated internal visionary states ofthe shaman involve a reduction of other inputs, in essence a reduction of externalsensory information and bodily input. This reduced sensory and bodily inputresponse can be produced in part by just the opposite, high levels of sensory(drumming) and bodily (dancing) stimulation. This excessive stimulation leadsto exhaustion and habituation of the nervous system response, resulting in thecessation of attention to external and physical stimuli that facilitates an internalfocus of attention. This interactive dynamic of integration and dissociation is alsoaddressed in the context of possession and related conditions in Chapter 5.Crawford proposed that hypnosis and its enhanced attention reflect aninteraction between subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms that enable highlyhypnotizable people to sustain attention as well as disattention. Crawford sug-gested that concentration and suppression are two aspects of the same cognitiveprocesses involving the willful direction of attention. The attentional mechanismsinvolved in extreme focus of attention and hypnotizability are those related to thefar frontal cortex’s regulation of limbic system activity and gating for incomingsensory stimuli. A consequence of the highly hypnotizable individual’s more effi-cient far frontal limbic attentional systems is the ability to disattend to extraneousstimuli, known as cognitive inhibition. Hypnotizability and inhibition are associ-ated with theta-wave production, which produces more efficient attention andperformance. This enhanced theta is associated with right-hemisphere activityamong the highly hypnotizable.Enhanced limbic frontal interaction characteristic of highly hypnotizableindividuals is a pattern of brain functioning that typifies the model of the IMCpresented here. Hypnosis typifies the natural response of the brain in which thereis an enhanced interaction between the limbic and the frontal brain, enhancingconnections across the neuraxis. The flexibility of outcomes at both experientialand physiological levels that is associated with highly hypnotizable persons andtheir cognitive flexibility reflects their ability to shift awareness and cognitivestrategies. Highly hypnotizable individuals also show other specific information-processing abilities: to become deeply engrossedin imaginative activities; toproduce vivid imagery; and to engage holistic information-processing styles(paraphrase of Crawford 1994, 223).Functional connectivity is the theme for understanding conscious states andhypnosis, and a number of researchers have identified networks of functionalconnectivity associated with hypnosis (Jamieson 2007, 6, 7). The effects of top-down mechanisms on bottom-up processes, in essence the abilities of intentions32SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"to override the manifestations of lower level autonomic and involuntaryprocesses, illustrates how the dynamics of one level are integrated into another.A basic principle of phylogenetic brain evolution is increasing hierarchical inte-gration, a top-down inhibitory control of the brain stem and limbic regions bythe neocortex. Ray (2007) proposes that hypnosis be understood from an evolu-tionary perspective in terms of the interaction between the limbic and corticalstructures, where we find interplay between the executive control functions ofthe frontal cortex and the preconscious social mechanisms of the limbic levels.The hypnotic state influences (reduces) the higher level emotional processing ofbasic reflexes by the directions provided through the social and cognitive (infor-mational) influences of the hypnotist. Foundational to hypnosis are information-processing dynamics in which feelings take precedence over the sensory world indictating behavior.This reflects the basic features of the model of the integrative mode ofconsciousness (IMC), where lower level structures impose their dynamics onthe overall functional outcomes in the brain. The model of the IMC supportsthe state approaches to hypnosis, which see it as engaging something other thanour ordinary cognitive capacities, some structures of consciousness and brainnetworks distinct from those characteristic of ordinary waking consciousness.This reflects Jamieson and Hasegawa’s (2007, 141) proposal that we conceptual-ize hypnosis as a discrete ASC, a “discrete altered state of brain networks...[when] the dominant network of functional connectivity between local brainregions and its oscillatory dynamics have changed from a defined baseline state.”In contrast to the orientation of the external sensory world, hypnosis and theIMC engage this imagined alternative, which controls the body, including physio-logical responses, perceptions, emotions, behaviors, and thoughts.In hypnosis the higher order cognitive control functions that are based in thelinkages among frontal, subcortical, and posterior regions are disrupted, with “afundamental shift in the organization of executive functions within the brain”(Jamieson and Woody 2007, 119). Hypnosis disrupts the anterior system offlexible and rapid cognitive control, resulting in a breakdown in the integrativeprocessing of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left prefrontal cortex(PFC) (Jamieson and Woody, 123). Conflict-monitoring processes of the ACCmay continue but they are not integrated into the PFC; there are nonethelessincreases in the activation of the ACC under hypnosis, reflecting its role inspontaneous hallucinatory imagery.The connections of the ACC linking the PFC with motor and visual fieldsgive it roles in shaping both top-down and bottom-up processing, playing acentral role in differentially allocating control to various regions of the brain.Connections with the amygdala, hypothalamus, and other limbic regions give itcentral roles in providing motivational and emotional input to perceptions andbehaviors. Jamieson notes that the dominant theories of hypnosis emphasizethe interruption of a hierarchy of cognitive systems under hypnotic conditions,a dissociation of the executive supervisory attentional system from the conflict-monitoring regions of the brain found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)brain regions responsible for controlling autonomic, emotional, and cognitiveINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS33"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"processes. Hypnotic analgesia is also associated with enhanced functional modu-lation between the ACC and the brain regions associated with the integration ofsensory, motor, affective, and cognitive networks.The control of the emotional level of the brain through interactionswith higher cortical structures involves connections between the orbitofrontalcortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Ray 2007). The orbitofrontalcortex is a key structure lying just below the PFC, where it modulates emo-tional and motivation information; originally thought to be a crucial part ofthe limbic system, Allman et al. (2001) propose that it be seen as an evolved partof the neocortex. The orbitofrontal cortex also has key connections with theACC, a limbic lobe loop that reflects a neocortex specialization for managingand integrating emotional and cognitive information. This ACC area has beenrepeatedly implicated as key to the modulations of hypnotic experiences, par-ticularly the hallucinatory components. It also has a variety of crucial roles incognitive processes.The dorsal areas of the cingulate cortex form a “collar” (corpus callosum)that links the nerves connecting the two frontal hemispheres of the brain andreceives direct input from the hypothalamic emotional processing centers(Allman et al. 2001). Stimulation of the anterior part of the ACC produces theanimal’s full range of vocalization behaviors. The ACC has a very large numberof dopamine receptors, one of the highest of any area of the cortex, as wellas strong amygdala projections. The ACC has a wide range of outputs back intosubcortical structures. Because of its intense interconnectedness with limbicstructures, the ACC was traditionally seen as part of the limbic brain. Morerecently, however, it has been recognized as a specialization within the neocortexthat has central roles in control of emotions, problem solving, recognition oferrors, and the ability to make adaptive responses under conditions of change(Allman et al. 2001). The significance of the ACC for the evolution of conscious-ness is underscored by the presence there of spindle-shaped neurons found onlyin hominids (reported in original sources as hominoids, also meaning humans,their ancestor species, and the great apes). These neurons are a recent evolution-ary development, “a hominoid specialization of the neural circuitry of the[ACC],” with distal projections for coordination of diverse parts of the brain tosolve problems (Allman et al. 2001, 112).The ACC is a central neocortical area for the regulation of emotionalresponses and the focus of cognitive behaviors related to problem solving. TheACC is the source of the theta waves (4–7 cps) that are produced when peopleengage in tasks that require focus and concentration (Allman et al. 2001).Increased functioning of the ACC is associated with greater social insight. Theevolution of the ACC contributed to greater emotional self-control and the abil-ity to solve problems through the spindle neurons that connect and coordinatedistant and diverse parts of the brain. These functions of the ACC have helpedto clarify the fundamental role of emotions in consciousness, bioregulation, andcognition (Damasio 2001). The integration of emotional experience is crucial tomemory formation, reasoning, and decision making. The ACC and spindle cellsare a central part of the integration of emotions into focused problem solving,34SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"recognition of errors, and making adaptive responses. Emotions play a key role inmediating between the responses of the hardwired bioregulatory systems(“instincts”) and personal memories, providing the value systems that selectshort-term memory for permanent encoding. The ACC is specialized, with aventral function with respect to emotions and a dorsal function for cognition,internally mediating between the two. These mediating and connective functionsof the ACC epitomize the basic properties of the IMC.Meditation and Integrative Brain DynamicsThe integrative and dissociative brain dynamics of the IMC are also exemplifiedin studies of meditation. Although there is a range of different effects reflectingthe intents of practitioners, since the earliest studies there have been consistentreports of meditation resulting in increases in alpha and theta amplitude andregularity in the frontal and central regions of the brain. This initial evidence ofmeditation producing increases in slow-wave brain patterns continues to be con-firmed and extended (see Chapter 4).Recent research implicates an additionallevel of meditation-induced changes in brain waves, reflected in biphasic hyper-synchronous high-frequency gamma waves (Lehmann et al. 2001; Lutz et al.2004; Vialatte et al. 2009). The presence of gamma in meditation is direct confir-mation of the IMC model because gamma is associated with binding of diversesignals within the brain. The findings ofthis gamma binding ofactivities fromdiverse areas of the brain support the theta-wave psychointegration model ofthe IMC, because gamma synchronization is modulated by the theta and alpharhythms (Fries 2009, 217).Meditative experiences also involve selective segregation or deafferentationof input from brain systems. D’Aquili and Newberg (1999) examined a form ofmystical experience, the Absolute Unitary Being (AUB), in terms of systemic effectson the brain’s processing loops. The AUB involves an experience of awareness ofunlimited senses of self, being, other, time, and environment, accompanied by bliss-ful emotions. They propose that these AUB experiences involve interference withthe normal functions of four of the tertiary association areas. The relevant corticalregions are the inferior temporal lobe (ITL); the parietal lobe, specifically theinferior parietal lobe (IPL) and the posterior superior parietal lobe (PSPL); andthe prefrontal cortex (PFC). A primary function of the PSPL is the analysis and inte-gration of information, in particular higher order (previously processed) somaes-thetic (body) visual and auditory information to create a three-dimensional bodyimage in space. In defining the spatial location of the body, the PSLP also plays avital role in defining self-other differentiations. The IPL is an association area atthe junction of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, providing an integrationof information from the other association areas. The hippocampus is also an associ-ation area, specifically with information from the other association areas, but it isthe PFC that is the most central of all association areas. The PFC regulates by deter-mining the degree of saliency related signal-to-noise enhancement, as well as a widerange of higher executive functions.INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS35"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"D’Aquili and Newberg propose that deafferentation, a functional cutting offof input into a structure, such as caused by inhibitory fibers, explains some aspectsof mystical experiences. Deafferentation results in the structure firing according toan internal logic or pattern, independent of normal input from other parts of thebrain. As an example, d’Aquili and Newberg note the ability of the PFC to directattention to inhibit input from the IPL (a language-processing area), resulting inthe inhibition of those areas producing and transmitting words and concepts toother areas of the brain. Such inhibition explains the ineffable aspects of mysticalexperiences, a result of being cut off from language production centers.Other aspects of AUB can be explained by similar activation and inhibitionof specific circuits. D’Aquili and Newberg propose that the neuropsychologicalfoundations of mystical states involve a “differential stimulation and deaffer-entation of various patterns of limbic stimulation” (1993, 177). Specific effectsinclude relaxation and profound quiescence from hypothalamic stimulation ofthe peripheral parasympathetic system; ecstatic and blissful feelings from rever-berating PSLP-PFC circuits that result in stimulation of both divisions of theANS; and a sense of pure space and obliteration of the self-other distinction fromthe total deafferentation of the PSPL. But contrary to the notion of a loss of vitalintegrative functions of the PFC, d’Aquili and Newberg (1999) found that therewas an increase in blood flow to that region, as well as the thalamic areas; incontrast, the PSLP showed decreased activity. Thus in enhancing the attentionalprocesses characteristic of meditation, there is a necessary deafferentation ofinput from other systems, such as the environment, that would be distracting tothe highly focused attention.Common Denominators in Modifying ConsciousnessFrecska and Luna (2006) suggested that the common denominator in techniquesthat alter consciousness involve two opposite processes: overstressing the high-level (frontal-prefrontal) circuits of the coping mechanisms or deregulatingthem, pushing them below the lower limit of functional range. They propose thatthe resulting effect is the emergence of a direct-intuitive information processingas replacement to the ordinary perceptual-cognitive processing, which is funda-mentally a prefrontally mediated coping strategy. Frecska and Luna point to sup-port for this model of integrative consciousness and expand its principles andneurointegrative mechanisms with insights into (1) the final common pathwayof psychedelic drugs’ action in the thalamus; (2) the role of thalamic gammasynchronization in binding; (3) the vertical organization of fronto-subcortico-thalamic feedback loops; and (4) their relations to the horizontal layering ofMcLean’s triune brain model.Previc (2006) proposes that there is a common neuroanatomy and neuro-chemistry underlying phenomena such as dreaming, hallucinations, and extremereligious beliefs. The common neural substrate involves dopamine, particularlyelevated levels in the ventromedial cortical areas. This corresponds to theanatomical basis of these phenomena, which he postulates to “be mediated by36SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ventromedial (cortico-limbic) pathways extending from the medial temporal lobeto the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex” (Previc, 518). Previc notes thatthere are a number of psychological disorders (i.e., bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia) that are both (1) associated withincreased religious activity, experiences, or religious practices; and (2) involve anoveractivation of dopamine, particularly in the left hemisphere. Furthermore,the brain activity typical of disorders associated with hyper-religiosity, as well asdreams, hallucinations, paranormal experiences, and paranormal behaviorsinvolve action in the ventromedial system of extrapersonal functions, which isfreed from the inhibition by the prefrontal (focal-extrapersonal or executive)dopaminergic system and/or posterior serotonergic (peripersonal) inputs. Previcproposes that religious behavior andspiritual experiences in particular are pri-marily produced via dopaminergic transmission within the brain’s extrapersonalsystems in the ventromedial cortex. These extrapersonal phenomena, such asout-of-body experiences, as well as personality manifestations in delusions ofgrandiosity and obsessiveness, also reflect a relative deactivation of the dorsalfrontal-parietal linkages.Diverse forms of altered consciousness all involve this enhanced capability toaccess the output of the unconscious mind and our innate cognitive modules.These capacities are elicited by many mechanisms, and particularly manifestedin the visual system, where the effects of vision-inducing plants are among themost prominent mechanisms. They enabled an extended exploitation of the vis-ual associational cortex and its ability to managing visual and other information.This expanded associational area improved the brain’s capacity to interface with avariety of other neural mechanisms, including those involved in learning,problem-solving, and memory formation.Psychedelics, the Brain, and ConsciousnessThe worldwide association of psychedelics with spiritual traditions reflects theirintrinsic ability to produce profound alterations of consciousness. These altera-tions provide a basic neurophenomenological paradigm for understanding thenature of shamanism. The recurrent features of the mystical experiences inducedby these substances indicate that they reflect biological bases and neurognosticforms, biologically based aspects of knowing. The role of drugs in the evolutionof human consciousness must be understood in relationship to their effects onthe serotonergic system, indirectly on dopamine, and the overall roles of bothneurotransmitter system in brain functioning. These alterations of consciousnessenhance paleomammalian brain functions and their coordination and their inte-gration with the entire brain. This integration enhances integration of uncon-scious processes and potentials into consciousness and the frontal brainprocesses. Human evolution was stimulated by interactions among exogenousneurotransmitter substances, the adaptive potentials of the states of conscious-ness they produced, and the shamanic ritual practices that supported the engage-ment with altered states.INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS37"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"These activities engaged an integration of some aspects of consciousnessand dissociation or deafferentation of others. In these complementary andcodependent processes, the alteration of consciousness involves an enhanced inte-gration of lower brain processes that may simultaneously involve a disengagementwith other habitual processes of knowing. This illustrates how altered conscious-ness constitutes a special biologically based form of knowing that engages brainstructures that preceded language and continue to function without it, albeitnormally dissociated, and hence unconsciously.Examination of these brain patterns of altered consciousness from the per-spectives of MacLean’s (1990) model of the triune brain illustrates the elicitationof the paleomentation and the emotiomentation processes of lower brain struc-tures (R-complex and limbic brain) and their management of emotions, attach-ment, social relations and bonding, sense of self, and convictions about beliefs.These procedures and conditions that alter consciousness have an intrinsic poten-tial to produce an integration of information processing between the R-complexand the limbic system, between the limbic system and the frontal cortex, andbetween the hemispheres of the cortex; hence the labeling as theintegrativemodeof consciousness.A primary characteristic of integrative consciousness involves hierarchicalintegration of brain mechanisms, a limbic-system driving of the frontal cortexthat integrates the preconscious or unconscious functions and material intoself-conscious awareness. Key physiological mechanisms underlying integrativeforms of consciousness are found in activation of the the hippocampal-septal cir-cuits, the hypothalamus, and related areas of the paleomammalisn brain thatregulate emotions and drives for self-preservation (MacLean 1990). These effectscontribute to a second characteristic of integrative forms of consciousness, theability to act on the structures of earlier levels of consciousness. This action onthese brain structures engages operational structures of the unconscious and dis-sociated aspects of the self producedby emotional trauma. This engagementallows elicitation of aspects of the psyche and their manipulation from a higherlevel of awareness and self-organization, a human capacity exemplified in thehealing rituals of shamanism.AN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGICAL APPROACHTO SHAMANISMThe cross-cultural manifestations of basic experiences related to shamanism(e.g., soul flight, death-and-rebirth, animal identities) illustrates that thesepractices are not strictly cultural but are structured by underlying, biologicallyinherent structures. These are neurobiological structures of knowing that providethe universal aspects of the human brain/mind (Laughlin, McManus, andd’Aquili 1992). Neurognostic structures are the inherent knowledge structuresof the organism that predispose and mediate the organization of experience.Universal shamanic characteristics reflect these neurognostic structures, such asthose of archetypes, the primordial organization of the collective unconscious.38SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A number of contemporary theorists have similarly argued that the underly-ing basis for religious universals is found in unconscious processing systems ofthe brain. This approach is based in the broader idea of inborn or innate modulesfor organizing knowledge, which several researchers use to explain the evolutionof the human mind in terms of specific specialized programs (e.g., Fodor’s[1983]The Modularity of the Mind, where he proposes that there are hardwiredinput systems that provide for automatic information-processing systems). Thismodular model of human cognition was expanded in Gardener’sFrames of Mind:The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, where Gardener (1983) postulated thathuman capabilities are based on seven different types of relatively autonomousintelligences: bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, and modules for looking in at one’sown mind and for understanding others’ minds and for language, music, andlogical-mathematical reasoning. The innate quality of these capacities is clearlyreflected in the various savants who are geniuses in one of the capacities whilelacking normal human skills in the other areas.These innate capacities are not, however, based on discrete anatomical units,but rather reflect functional systems that link together the specialized inputcapacities. For instance, in his discussion of the elements of intersubjectivity,Gardenfors (2008) notes that the capacity of “mind reading” is based not onlyon a “theory of mind” but also on capacities for detection of intentions, eye direc-tion, and shared attention. These diverse components illustrate the multiplesystems underlying any modular capacity. Nonetheless, they are specialized andlargely unconscious functional systems of information processing and output thatreflect the influences of natural selection in setting a genetic basis for an adapta-tion that provides a specialized functional capacity. These specialized unconsciousfunctions are exemplified in the grammatical competence of language speakers,most of who are without conscious awareness of their own grammatical rules.Evidence for the existence of these kinds of innate modules also comes fromfindings in developmental psychology that indicate that children are born withcontent-rich intuitive knowledge modules that explain humans’ rapid learning ofspecific kinds of information. The inevitability of language acquisition in normalcultural contexts and the normal attribution of beliefs and desires to others reflectthe operation of these innate capacities of the human brain. Some of the areas ofinnately disposed cognitive development that are key to understanding humanuniqueness include deliberate imitation (mimesis), physical behavior (tool use),natural history (animal behavior), social psychology (social relations and mind),and communication (music and language). These areas of specialized learningreflect evolutionary adaptations providing specialized automatized skills thatenhance awareness of important natural and social relations and their benefits.Religious Thought and Innate ModulesRecent cognitive theories regarding the origin of religious thought have emphasizedthe roles of these kinds of innate modules, neurognostic structures, and functionalsystems (e.g., Boyer 1992, 2001; Mithen 1996; Laughlin et al. 1992; Laughlin 1997;INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS39"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Winkelman 2002a; Boyer and Lie ́nard 2006). Boyer and Bergstrom (2008) note thata prominent feature of efforts to explain the universal features of religion in evolu-tionary terms is the emphasis on the output of ordinary cognitive systems, such asanimacy detection and precautionary systems. These approaches generally charac-terize religious thought as a by-product of or parasite on our normal thought pro-cesses acquired for a variety of other physical social adaptations.Spirits and the Hyperactive Agency (Animacy) Detection DeviceBarrett (2000) posits that a fundamental mental module underlying our spiritualdispositions involves a “hyperactive agency detection device” (HADD) that pro-vides us with a highly susceptible disposition to perceive an active agent, inessence animism, the spiritual world. Agency detection is a widely noted tendencyof humans and other animals to respond to situations as if there is an intelligentpurposeful agent as the underlying cause of the events we perceive. This HADDhas conferred survival benefits because it allowed our ancestors to avoid preda-tors, and an oversensitivity to an imaginary predator had little or no cost com-pared to that of not identifying a real predator. Guthrie (1993) argued that thebasic assumptions of animism provided selective advantages even though thisassumption may frequently be false. The benefits of assuming that something isintention and potentially active is adaptive for all animals.This tendency to view the world as having unseen agents contributed to thehuman tendency to believe in unseen spirits. Atran (2006) proposed that thisevolved mental hardware for animacy detection was extended from its functions ofdetection of predators to an automatic perception of the dynamics of other phe-nomena. Animism is the result of our normal cognitive processes, producing a ten-dency to presume that the actions of some unseen agent are responsible for events ofunknown origin, especially phenomena with complex designs and unusual features.When we look at spirits, however, we see that they are much more than justagents; they are special kinds of agents. These differentiating principles of spiritsare a basis from which an exaptation of the HADD provides a basis for new adap-tive functions. Chapter 6 examines these adaptive functions of spirit assumptions,proposing that there are a number of distinctive advantages of these assumptionsthat go beyond animacy detection (also see Winkelman and Baker 2008).Boyer (1992, 2001) proposed that religious notions are based in counterin-tuitive contradictions to the dispositions of these innate modules and character-ized the supernatural as involving concepts that violate intuitive knowledgeprovided by the different specialized intelligences. In contrast, Mithen pointedout that ethnographic evidence indicates that intuitive religious ideas are thenorm rather than counterintuitive exceptions. Mithen proposed that the integra-tion of innate modules, rather than their counterintuitive violations, provides thebasis for religious ideas. Features of supernatural beings involve a “mixing up ofknowledge about different types of entities in the real world” (Mithen 1996, 177),an integration of the multiple specialized intelligences of the early human mind.Concepts of supernatural beings mix properties of the social and the naturalworlds (totemic groups), the personal and natural worlds (animal identities),40SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"and the personal and physical worlds (animacy). These key concepts of shaman-ism reflect cognitive fluidity between these distinct intelligences that are derivedfrom the integration of operations from different cognitive modules.The dominant cognitive theories ofreligious universals treat religiousthought and spiritual experiences as epiphenomena or distortions of capacitiesthat serve other purposes. Consequently they overlook the significant psychologi-cal and social functions they fulfill. Deacon and Cashman (2009) offer a differentview followed here, namely that spiritual and mystical experiences engage novelmeanings that expand humans’ perspectives beyond those produced by biology.The spiritual is an emergent feature of our species, one that was co-emergent withour symbolic capacities, and which radically reorganized cognitive processes,emotional experiences and social behaviors.This book further proposes that shamanism contributed to human cognitiveevolution through the ritual elicitation and integration of innate modules thatproduced analogical symbolic thought. It also incorporates a generally neglectedperspective in religious studies, the focus on ritual, or behavior, as opposed tocognition. This provides a deep phylogenetic perspective for understanding theadaptive aspects of religion in general, and shamanism in particular.Ritual as Costly SignalsBoyer and Bergstrom note that behavioral ecologists and anthropologists havetaken a distinctly different approach to explaining universals of religion as formsof adaptation, placing them in the context of “costly signals” (see Irons [2001];Sosis [2004]; Wilson [2002]) and other practices that foster cooperation(e.g., Weingarten and Chisholm [2009]; Bulbulia [2009]). The apparent lack offitness advantages of many religious and ritual behaviors is countered with theperspective that such behaviors are displays of “excessive fitness,” a form of honestsignaling of an individual’s exceptional capacities. Animal displays that apparentlyattract attention from predators have been interpreted as indicators of strengthand swiftness, signals that convey to predators that they are more likely to besuccessful if they seek less aware and fit prey. Costly signaling approaches extendaltruism perspectives regarding potential adaptive benefits conferred by ritualbehaviors, signaling a willingness to cooperate and assist others. In the contextof animals’ excessive fitness displays, there is also an embedded signaling toconspecifics of a danger that they should heed. Shamanic ritual practices involvingprolonged periods of dancing and drumming have direct homologies with theexcessive displays seen in other species, and provide another avenue for investigat-ing the adaptive aspects of shamanic practice (see Chapter 6).The costly signaling approaches areexpanded by the perspectives ofbiogenetic structuralism, which help to illustrate the ancient biological bases ofshamanic rituals and their adaptive functions in their homologies with animaldisplays. The biogenetic structuralist approach to ritual establishes human-animal continuities that illustrate the evolutionary foundations of shamanismand other forms of religious thought.

Such animal rituals use behaviors,manifested in actions, that signal a disposition for specific behaviors. Animals’rituals have communication and social signaling functions, using geneticallybased behaviors to provide information that facilitates interactions amongmembers of a species, coordinating their behaviors in ways that contribute tocooperation. By making internal dispositions publicly available, animal ritualscontribute to cooperative behaviors by providing information that helpsproduce socially coordinated responses.InSupernatural as Natural, Winkelman and Baker (2008) use this biogeneticstructuralist approach to establish the continuity of animal displays and human rit-uals. This evolutionary psychology approach to ritual illustrates that shamanic rit-uals have ancient roots built out of prior adaptations revealed in the homologousbehaviors humans share with closely related species. This approach is foundationalto the perspectives developed here on how shamanic ritual activities provide impor-tant social functions in enhancing social cooperation and integration.Altered Consciousness as an AdaptationThis book expands our perspectives on the adaptive nature of shamanic practicesby examining the effects of the extraordinary altered states of conscious producedby ritual. Experiences, too, can contribute to adaptations if they lead to behaviorsthat enhance survival and reproductive potential for self and offspring. The IMCelicited by ritual activities creates specialaspects of consciousness, providing abasis for the production of analogical and metaphorical thought by integratingthe outputs of the modules for social perceptions of others and their intentional-ities (mind reading) with innate specialized abilities to understand the qualities ofanimal species and their differences.A fundamental aspect of shamanic thought involves the integration of thisnatural history capacity for recognition of animal species with other forms of selfand social representation to produce supernatural concepts represented byanimal spirits and familiars and totemism. A consequence of the integrative brainwave states induced in shamanic states of consciousness is a synesthesia, or mix-ing of different sensory experiences that underlie the symbolic function (see Hunt1995a). Alterations of consciousness also produce a synchronization of differentbrain areas, an integration of modular brain functions that enhances thisintegrative thinking and symbolic thought. The ritually induced cross-modularintegration of innate capacities produce the cognitive foundations for universalfeatures of shamanistic thought. These are manifested in concepts of animismand the spirit world and their relations to human communities, and in the roleof animal spirits in shamanic practice, identification, and thought.Shamanistic practices induce extraordinary experiences and healing by rituallyeliciting normal but unusual aspects of organismic functioning. A primary focus ofthe psychophysiological effects of the IMC is in the limbic system, or more broadlythe paleomammalian brain, and its connections with both lower and higher brainstructures. Shamanistic practices stimulate processes of the paleomammalian brainand induce a systemic integration of information-processing capacities across the42SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"functional layers of the brain, producing healing through psychointegration—limbic-cortical integration and interhemispheric synchronization.These experiences also reflect the elicitation of information-processingcapacities fundamental to human nature, the IMC, which in interaction withritually-induced social, cultural, and personal effects, produces a range of experi-ences associated with shamanism and mystical traditions. These altered con-sciousness experiences also enhance our ability to think about and plan activitiesthat are distal in time and space.These experiences, the interpretations made ofthem, and their effects on behavior provide a basis for functional adaptationsassociated with shamanic ritual practices.There are a number of different kinds or levels of meaning that mediate ourknowledge of the material world, including ancient aspects of the brain and theirinformation-processing capacities that mediate relationships of self and conscious-ness. Shamanistic healing practices achievethis psychointegration by physicalstimulation of systematic brain wave discharge patterns that activate processes ofthe paleomammalian brain. This activation forces normally unconscious or precon-scious primary information-processing functions and outputs to be integrated intothe operations of the frontal cortex. This integrates implicit understandings of soci-oemotional dynamics, repressed memories, unresolved conflicts, and intuitive andnonverbal knowledge—visual, mimetic, and presentational—into self-consciousawareness. It is this elevation of the subconscious and unconscious processes thatis at the basis of a variety of shamanistic experiences and spiritual phenomena.CONCLUSIONS: VISIONARY EXPERIENCEAS A NEUROEPISTEMOLOGICAL SYSTEMAlterations of consciousness involve adaptations, special forms of knowing, thatprominently engage the imagetic capacity for presentational symbolism. Thisancient system of visual symbolism predates language, yet it can also provideknowledge—even wisdom—beyond that normally associated with rationalwaking language-based consciousness. The visionary experiences of shamans intheir soul flights exemplify this intuitive and visual iconic presentational symbol-ism. Altered consciousness plays a special role in managing adaptation to bothinternal and external environments through information manifested primarilyas visual symbolism spontaneously produced by our symbolizing brains inre-representing the environmental and internal stimuli it receives.The qualities of this altered consciousness reflect an early level of symbolismthrough which we know the universe in ways much like those of other animalsthrough the processes dominated by our ancient reptilian and paleomammalianbrains. These processes of consciousness make available a variety of pre-languagestructures and processes of knowing, a rich information system lying behind thelanguage-based rational consciousness of modern humans. What characterizes thespecial nature of these forms of knowing involves the integration of these ancientlevels of understanding into the processes of the frontal brain and our moreadvanced cognitive capacities and senses of self. This is a psychointegration ofINTRODUCTION TO SHAMANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS43"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"behavioral and emotional processes into our preeminently symbolic brain pro-cesses. This process is the basis for a new conceptualization and paradigm of alteredconsciousness proposed here, one that characterizes these conditions as specialforms of the integration of consciousness, characterized by an elevation of the pre-conscious protosymbolic processes of the ancient reptilian and paleomammalianbrains. These preformal levels of consciousness are found in several special aspectsof shamanism; specifically, the nature of the experiences of altered consciousnessthat provide a holistic intuitive grasp of situations, special forms of preself-identification in spirits and animals, and forms of intense emotional engagementand detachment that underlie the therapeutic potentials of shamanism.44SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"2The Nature and Basisof Shamanism:Cross-Cultural, Linguistic,and PrehistoricalPerspectivesCHAPTER OVERVIEWEliade’s (1964) synthesis of the cross-cultural data illustrated universals of sha-manism and its social functions. The shaman was the primordial human special-ist, a skilled manager of consciousness, emotions, social relations, health, andinteraction with the natural and supernatural.Anthropological studies of sha-manistic phenomena stimulated debates as to the status of the concept of theshaman. Empirical answers to questions regarding the characteristics of shamanswere provided by studies using formal analysis of cross-cultural data (Winkelman1984, 1986a&b, 1990, 1992). These studies illustrated that shamanism was aworldwide phenomenon of hunter-gatherer societies. This ecologically specificadaptation suggested the termshamanbe restricted to practitioners foundprimarily in nomadic hunter-gatherer societies and sharing specific empiricallyderived characteristics. The termshamanistic healercan be applied to anexpanded group of healing professionals who use the altered states of conscious-ness (ASC). The evolution of these shamanistic healers from shamanic roots isillustrated in diverse linguistic referents. Shamanism’s ancient presence in humansocieties is evidenced in its central role in the art characteristic of the culturalexplosion of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic and in the social and cognitive adapta-tions provided by shamanism. I propose shamanism as the mechanism by whichthe distinct modules for human thought were integrated, producing syntheticsymbolic representations that are exemplified in totemism as a system of socialrepresentation.THE PHENOMENA OF SHAMANISMThe central role of the shaman as a primordial spiritual and religious leader isindicated in the prominent role of shamanic representations found worldwidein art, cosmology, and religious artifacts, particularly in the cave paintings found45"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"in the caves of Europe (Clottes and Lewis-Williams 1998; Whitley 2009). Thepreeminence of shamanistic practices in contemporary small-scale societiesis also widely attested to in numerous ethnographic sources (see Walker andFreidman 2005).Although evidence of shamanic practices is found across history and prehis-tory, shamanism was not recognized in the cultural practices of post-RenaissanceEuropean societies. The modern introduction of shamanism to Western scienceand society was through exposure to it in other cultures only a few centuriesago. The conventional explanation (Flaherty 1992) of the origin of the termshamanin the English language is that it was borrowed from German. Germanscientific explorations brought the term and the concept (saman)fromtheTungus of Siberia via Russian. Etymologically similar terms are widely dispersedin the Siberian region, Asia, and Europe. Shamanistic phenomena are recountedin literature as early as the fifth century B.C. In 1253, a Franciscan monk, Vilhelmav Ruysbroeck of France, returned from an expedition to outer Mongolia andreported his observations of what he labeled “devil worship” (Siikala 1978). Withthe Siberian migrations and scientific expeditions of Russians into Siberia in theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there were increasing encounters with sha-manistic activities. As a consequence, knowledge of shamanistic practices wasincreasingly brought to the attention of the intelligentsia of Russia and, throughthem, to the rest of Europe. Shamanism impacted Western scientific, academic,and social spheres in the seventeenth century as reports from the non-Westernworld became an increasing part of the literary and cultural life of Europe(Flaherty). The reports of explorers, traders, missionaries, colonists, military,and other representatives of Western culture in contact with these foreign prac-tices provided a body of knowledge about what came to be known as the shaman.The reports wove together loosely connected ideas and observations that weretypically poor, unsystematic, and unreliable, characterized by cribbing and sensa-tionalism (Flaherty).In the context of the Enlightenment and the revolutionary changes wroughtin thought and society, shamanistic practices came to represent an irrational sideof human nature, where charismatic performances dominated social life. Thiscontrasted with the bureaucratization and rationalism dominating the emergingethos of Europe. The sensationalistic, disbelieving perspectives of Europeaninvestigators contributed to a pattern of reporting on shamanistic phenomenathat focused on incredulousand outlandish claims. Shamanistic phenomenawere viewed as representative of the irrationality of the non-Western “other.”The shaman was viewed as a clever fraud, a “mad” theatrical performer, who,by deceit and guile, held sway over the simpleminded community.Whereas most early descriptions were fragmentary and distorted, eventuallya somewhat more complete description of shamanic practices emerged on theYakut, Evenks, Buryats, and other Siberian groups in the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries. However, these observations from trained ethnographerslargely followed the political and societal reforms that had crushed or radicallytransformed Siberian shamanistic practices (Siikala). Much ethnography thatappeared in that period was by political prisoners who described transformed46SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"practices of people integrated to varying degrees into more complex societies. Itwas not until Czaplicka’s (1914) publication ofAboriginal Siberia,whichcom-piled and analyzed many of these earlier sources, that appreciable amounts of thismaterial were available in English. Studies on shamanistic practices in Finnish,Hungarian, and Turkish peoples soonfollowed, although many of these werenot available in English until the past several decades. Although the Siberian,Russian, and other Eurasian materials provided the primary focus for what wasrecognized as shamanism, reports from around the world contributed to a grow-ing body of knowledge on shamanistic practices (e.g., Benedict 1923). The role oftrance or ecstasy was widely recognized as a central tool of the shaman; it wasused in self-healing, training, healing patients, divination, and the multitude ofother tasks that shamans were called on to perform. More systematic andinformed perspectives on the shaman emerged and contributed to efforts to relateshamanism to a variety of ancient literary and mythological phenomena of classicantiquity (Flaherty). Knowledge about shamanism impacted theology, medicine,mythology, literature, and, finally, anthropology and the social sciences.The Classic ShamanA synthesis of a wide range of cross-cultural material on shamanistic practiceswas provided by the seminal and classic work of Mircea Eliade (1964, originally1951),Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy. Eliade expanded the fundamen-tal implications of the concept of shamanism by pointing out that the phenom-ena were not just Siberian and Eurasian practices, but could be found incultures around the world. Eliade summarized the core of shamanism as involv-ing the use of “techniques of ecstasy” in interaction with the spirit world onbehalf of the community. The shaman’s principal activities involved healing,divination, protection, and finding game animals.The shamanic ritual was a social activity of unparalleled importance in society,a “spectacle unequaled in the world of daily experience” (Eliade 1964, 511). It wasthe context for construction and performance of the basic cosmological, spiritual,religious, social, ecological, intercommunity, and healing activities in those soci-eties. The shaman’s curing ceremony was the most important group event andthe basic means of structuring the relationship of the individual to the collectivityand cosmos. The shaman’s community healing rituals played an essential role inthe defense of the psychic integrity of the community. Shamans were antidemonicchampions who fought spirits and disease and who defended “life, health, fertility,the world of light, against death, diseases, sterility, disaster, and the world of dark-ness” (Eliade, 509). The shaman brought the local community into interactionwith the spirit world in a ritual charged with fear, awe, and other powerful emo-tional experiences. In a nighttime ceremony attended by the entire local group,the shaman enacted struggles and battles of animals and spirits, summoning spiritallies while beating drums, singing, chanting, and dancing violently and excitedly.Finally the shaman collapsed exhausted and through magical flight, entered intothe spirit world to communicate with the spirits and to obtain their cooperation.THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM47"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The shaman’s ecstatic state was characterized as a soul flight, “a trance duringwhich his soul is believed to leave his body and ascend to the sky or descend tothe underworld” (Eliade 1964, 5). The shaman’s classic flight may take a varietyof forms involving some aspect of the practitioner—called the soul, spirit, or ani-mal familiar—that separates from the physical body, entering into an experientialworld and interacting with spirit entities. The shaman’s flight may be in corporealform or in the transformed guise of animals or spirit allies. The shaman was notpossessedby spirits, but rather was in control of spirits and demons. The shamanmay enter into any of three classic worlds (lower, middle, and upper) during soulflight, through which many tasks were accomplished: healing, dream interpreta-tion, divination, clairvoyance (clear seeing), acquiring needed information,determining distant conditions or the fate of separated group members, findinglost objects, acquiring information for hunting, handling of fire, communicationwith spirits of the dead, recoveryof lost souls, mediation between gods andpeople, escorting souls of the dead, and protection against spirits and malevolentmagical practitioners.At the basis of shamanistic practice and its assumptions is an animisticsystem, a belief in a cosmos populated by spiritual entities that have effects onall aspects of human life and nature. The spiritual entities have roles in theessence of nature and natural forces, including humans and other animals. Spiritsare central to shamanistic healing, and communication with them is used todetermine the causes of illness, which are generally attributed to the influencesand actions of spiritual entities. Learning the language of the animals is centralto this shamanic practice. The shaman develops relationships with animal spirithelpers, especially birds, which symbolize the magical flight. The animal spiritsare controlled by the shaman and are the vehicle through which the shamancarries out a variety of activities. Animal transformation, like soul flight, can takethe shaman into an ascent into the sky, movement through the earth, and adescent to the lower world, frequently through tree- or pole-climbing rites. Theshamanic movement through these worlds involves theaxis mundi, the “center,”“opening,” or “hole” through which the shamans, spirits, and gods descend andascend. The birch tree, post, or pillar symbolizes the Cosmic Tree, Sacred Tree,or World Tree, the vehicle of ascension, which interpenetrates and connects theshaman’s three worlds—sky, earth, and lower world. Another mythical image ofthis movement across worlds is the Cosmic Mountain or a ladder, which theshaman ascends.Shamanic activities were typically concerned with health. The theories of ill-ness typically considered people to have lost their souls or to be afflicted by theactions of witches, ghosts, spirits, or the malevolent action of other shamans.The interactions in the spirit world typically involved psychodramatic strugglesto recover the patient’s soul. This soul loss could be caused by spirits’ aggressionor by theft by other shamans. Thesebeliefs represented basic psychoculturaldynamics with the spirit world interaction via the shaman’s activities evokingpowerful emotional experiences and healing. In addition to socio- and psycho-therapeutic functions, healing ceremonies also incorporated physical medicinesuch as cleansing of wounds, extraction of objects, herbal medicine and massage.48SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Selection for the role of the shaman was often derived from a prolongedperiod of illness or insanity that was caused by the spirits who chose the individ-ual for the shamanic role. The worsening of the individual’s circumstances oftenthen led to experiences interpreted as death, often experienced as dismember-ment, and followed by a rebirth. During this period of death, the spirits healedthe initiates by giving new rules for life that made the person a “wounded healer.”This encounter with death wasalso a spontaneous phenomenon of the visionquest, when an initiate sought spiritual power in a solitary vigil. These powersmight appear in the form of savage beasts that attacked and killed the initiate,but then reassembled the person with new capacities and powers, a death-and-rebirth experience that empowered the shaman.The Shaman as a Cross-Cultural PhenomenonEliade’s summary suggested that the shaman was a worldwide phenomenon, withpractitioners in diverse cultures sharing common characteristics and functions.This led a generation of researchers (e.g., Halifax 1979; Harner 1982; Hultkrantz1966, 1973, 1978; Siikala 1978) to postulate a variety of universals of shamanism,including not only an ecstatic state of communication with the spirit world onbehalf of the community, but a variety of other features as well, including beingfound in hunter-gatherer societies, selection for the position through an illnessor a calling of the spirits, a vision quest, a death/rebirth experience, the capacityto fly, the ability to transform oneself into an animal, the use of animal spiritsas assistants, and the potential to be a witch or a sorcerer with negative use ofpower.Most have also considered an essential aspect of the shaman’s ecstatic statesto involve, at least on some occasions, an experience labeled as soul flight. Soulflight is an experience in which the shaman’s soul or spirit, along with some senseof self, is thought to depart the body and travel to a spirit world. Some investiga-tors have disagreed regarding the nature of the shamanic ecstatic state. Findeisen(1957) argued that possession, when a spirit is believed to take over and controlthe individual, is also a characteristic of shamans; others such as Peters andPrice-Williams (1989) have also attributed possession to shamanism.Many types of individuals and practices have been referred to as shaman andshamanism, respectively, including those also called witch doctor, medicine man,healer, medium, soothsayer, diviner, warlock, wizard, and others. There arenumerous characteristics, activities, and roles ascribed to a shaman—an ecstaticpractitioner, a healer, a psychopomp, a political ruler, a prophesier, and oneinvolved in the death transition, hunting magic, depossession, physical and spiri-tual protection, sacrifice, art, and mythology. Of these many characteristics anddescriptions, investigators wonder what can validly be attributed to a universallydistributed phenomenon appropriately labeled “shamanism.” One reason for thisuncertainty and the inconclusive characterization of the shaman is the relativerecency of systematic cross-cultural studies of these phenomena that can provideempirical answers to these long-standing questions.THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM49"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Although shamans, mediums, and other magico-religious healers have beenof long-standing concern to anthropologists, until recently there have been fewempirical cross-cultural assessments of the nature of magico-religious healingpractices. Many accept that practices related to shamanism are cross-cultural,but do not clearly explicate the commonalities or the empirical basis for claimsto universality. Others reject a universal shamanism, arguing that the term sha-man should be restricted to Siberian and sub-Arctic practitioners (Siikala 1978;Kehoe 2000). Some use the term shaman more broadly to refer to anyone whovoluntarily uses ASC (Peters and Price-Williams 1981). Heinze (1991) exempli-fies a definitional approach, considering shamans to be those individuals whofulfill community needs by mediating between the profane and the sacredthrough accessing ASC. But she arbitrarily rejected other characteristics men-tioned by Eliade and others (e.g., power over animals, fire immunity, and dis-memberment experiences) because those characteristics were not associatedwith some practitioners she called shamans. While including Asian trancemediums within the denotation of shaman, she rejected the extension of theterm shaman to similar practitioners in the United States. Arbitrary definitionalapproaches cannot establish what to call a shaman, nor can they elucidate cross-cultural similarities and differences among religious healers. Establishingshamanism as an etic phenomenon (ortranscendental noumena) requirescross-cultural research.A Cross-Cultural Study of Magico-Religious PractitionersDetermining the cross-cultural validity of the concept of the shaman has beenaddressed by empirical research on magico-religious practitioners that used for-mal analysis of data (Winkelman 1984, 1986a, 1990, 1992). This analysis permit-ted an empirical determination of a cross-cultural phenomenon associated withthe classical concepts of the shaman, the characteristics associated with them, aswell as the differences with respect to other types of magico-religious practitionersand healers. This study utilized a 47-society stratified subsample of the StandardCross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) (Murdock and White 1969; see Winkelman[1984, 1992] and Winkelman and White [1987] for data and methods). Thesesocieties cover a time span ranging from 1750 B.C. (Babylonians) to the twentiethcentury and cover the major geographic regions of the world.Determination of the etic status and cross-cultural characteristics of the sha-man was based on coding of data from ethnographies and quantitative analysisof the data. Each unit of analysis was a culturally recognized magico-religiouspractitioner status, a social position based on interaction with supernatural enti-ties or power. While some societies had a single status, others had multiple typesof practitioners. Practitioners were individually assessed using the ethnographicliterature. The variables used to characterize the practitioners were developedfrom an extensive survey of theories and descriptions of magico-religious activ-ities. Each culturally recognized status (practitioner type) was individuallyassessed with respect to more thantwo hundred variables, evaluating a widerange of characteristics, including selection criteria; training conditions and50SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"procedures; ritual induction techniques,characteristics and labeling of alteredstates of consciousness; sources of power and relationships to spirit entities;magico-religious activities; types of healing and divination techniques employed;context and motives for professional activities; and sociopolitical powers andactivities. Determination of the types of practitioners was based on mathematicalassessment of the quantity of shared characteristics. Cluster analysis assessmentof shared characteristics provided the basis for determination of different typesof magico-religious practitioners (see Winkelman [1984, 1986a, 1992] for meth-ods and analysis. The original variables are available in Winkelman [1984]; anupdated/revised variable and data set is available on CD-ROM in Winkelmanand White [1987]).Types of Magico-Religious PractitionersThe different types of empirically determined magico-religious practitioners havebeen labeled with terms frequently employed by anthropologists: shaman, shaman/healer, healer, medium, priest, and sorcerer/witch. These practitioner types differ interms of central characteristics, as well as in the social complexity of their respec-tive societies. The primary contrasts among these different shamanistic healersand other magico-religious practitioners are provided in Table 2.1 (adapted fromWinkelman 1992). The practitioners found in different regions (e.g., Africa, Asia,and the Americas) include practitioners who share more characteristics incommon amongst themselves than they do with other magico-religious practi-tioners in their own society. The empirical similarity in practitioners is morerelevant thanaprioridefinitions or geographical location. This suggests that theterm shaman should be restricted to those magico-religious practitioners sharingsimilar characteristics, including their principal presence in hunter-gatherer soci-eties, where their activities first arose in sociocultural evolution. Shamans per-sisted in horticultural societies, but their practices undergo transformation as afunction of the effects of changing subsistence patterns and increased societalcomplexity (see Winkelman [1986a&b, 1990, 1992]).Shamanistic HealersPractitioners labeled shaman, shamanic healer, medium, and many other types ofhealers share the core characteristics ofshamanism suggested by Eliade (1964):altering consciousness in community rituals to engage in interaction with spiritualentities. However, not all shamanistic healers share other characteristics attributedto shamans: soul flight, animal transformation, animal spirits, death and rebirth,and hunting magic. But every society has religious healing practitioners who havea central concern with ritual procedures for altering consciousness. Because thetransformation of consciousness is central to the classic description and activitiesof shamans, and since the alteration of consciousness is an ancient biologicaladaptation (see Chapter 6), all magico-religious practitioners engaging in thealteration of consciousness as a central feature of training and healing are referredto here asshamanistic healers.THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM51"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"52TABLE 2.1Principal Characteristics of Magico-Religious Practitioner TypesCharacteristicsShamanSocietal ConditionsHunting and gathering, nomadic.No local political integration.No social classes.Magico-Religious ActivityHealing and divination.Protection from spirits and malevolentmagic.Hunting magic.Malevolent acts.Sociopolitical PowerCharismatic leader, communal and warleader.Social CharacteristicsPredominantly male, female secondary.High social status.Ambiguous moral status.Professional CharacteristicsPart time.No group—individual practice.Selection and TrainingVision quests, dreams, illness, and spirit’srequest.ASC and spirit training or individualpractitioner.Status recognized by clients.Motive and ContextActs at client request for client, localcommunity.Supernatural PowerAnimal spirits, spirit allies.Spirit power usually controlled.Special AbilitiesWeather control, flying, fire immunity,death and rebirth, transformation intoanimal.TechniquesSpirit control.Physical and empirical medicine.Massaging and plants.ASC Conditions and Spirit RelationsASC training and practice.Shamanic soul flight/journey.Isolation, austerities, fasting, hallucinogens,chanting and singing, extensive drummingand percussion, and, frequently, collapseand unconsciousness."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"53Shaman/HealerHealerAgricultural subsistence.Sedentary.Agricultural subsistence.Sedentary.Political integration.Healing and divination.Protection against spirits and malevolentmagic.Hunting magic and agricultural rites.Minor malevolent acts.Healing and divination.Agricultural and socioeconomic rites.Propitiation.Informal political power.Moderate judiciary decisions.Judicial, legislative, and economic power.Life-cycle rituals.Predominantly male.Moderate socioeconomic status.Predominantly moral status.Predominantly male, female rare.High socioeconomic status.Predominantly moral status.Part-time.Collective/group practice.Specialized role.Full-time.Collective/group practice.Highly specialized role.Vision quest, drams, illness and spiritrequests.ASC and ritual training by group.Ceremony recognizes status.Voluntary selection, paymentto trainer.Learn rituals and techniques.Ceremony recognizes status.Acts at client request in client group.Acts at client request in client group.Performs at public collective rituals.Spirits’ allies and impersonal power(mana).Power controlled.Superior gods and impersonal power(mana).Ritual techniques and formulas.Power under control.Occasional flight, animal transformation.Prevent future illness.Physical and empirical medicine.Massaging, herbal, cleanse wounds.Charms, spells exorcisms, and rituals.Spirit control and propitiation.Charms.

This suggests thatadoption of agriculture is a fundamental cause of the transformations of shamansinto shaman/healers. The fundamental role of agriculture in this transformationof shamanism is further attested toby the significant association of agriculturewith priests, and the general presence of priests in societies with shaman/healers.HealersThe presence of healers is significantly predicted by the presence ofpolitical integration beyond the level of the local community.

The presence of mediums is significantly correlated with both the pres-ence of political integration beyond the level of the local community and by socialstratification (permanent classes), but only political integration is an indepen-dently significant predictor.Priests and WitchesThere were other types of magico-religious practitioners found in societiesexcept those where there were shamans present. These other types of religiouspractitioners—priests and witches—are prominent in studies of religion.PriestsThe priests were generally found in sedentary agricultural societies orpastoral societies with political integration beyond the local community. Inde-pendently significant predictions of priests were found with agriculture andpolitical integration. This illustrates the development of priests under conditionsof agriculture and their emergence as central sociopolitical leaders as societiesincreased in political integration.Sorcerer/WitchThe sorcerer/witch is always found in societies with agricul-ture or pastoral subsistence patterns, but is not found in all of them; the socialconditions that significantly and independently predict the presence of asorcerer/witch are the presence of political integration and social stratification.Significantly, the sorcerer/witches and shamans do not occur in the same soci-eties. This and other forms of evidence suggest that these conditions producethe sorcerer/witch by the persecution of shamanistic healers (see Harner 1973bfor European witchcraft; Winkelman 1992 for cross-cultural analyses).The Cross-Cultural Characteristics of ShamansThe practitioners empirically clustered in the group labeled “shaman” conform tomany of the general characterizations found in the classic descriptions ofshamanism. Cross-cultural research indicates that shamans are the charismaticleaders in hunter-gatherer societies (and slightly more complex societies withhorticulture or pastoral subsistence practices) and where political integration islimited to the local community. The shaman’s political power is generally infor-mal, indicated by high social status, by position of leadership in raiding parties,and by organizing communal hunts and group movement. Shamans organizecommunal ritual activities on behalf of the entire local community, most fre-quently for healing and divination; however, they also are thought to engage inmalevolent magical acts designed to harm others, normally, enemies of the group.They may also be accused of sorcery by their own group.Shamansengageinactivitiesthatalterconsciousnessasthebasisfortheirtraining and professional service.

Their spiritworld experiences are generally labeled with terms implying soul flight or journeysto the spirit worlds. Possession, in which the spirits are believed to take over theperson, might be characteristic of some experiences of neophyte, but possessionis not normally associated with the experiences of shamans. The shaman’s ecstaticvisionary states, soul journey or flight, is validated as a universal of shamanism bythis cross-cultural research. However, not all professional activities of shamansinvolve soul flight; and when soul flight does occur, it is only one phase of the sha-man’s experiences. Shaman experiences may take other forms, including visionquests and death and rebirth. Other characteristics found with shamans includethe capacity to fly; relationships with and control of spirits, particularly animalspirits; and provision of hunting magic.The !Kung Num Master: Contemporary ShamanIncluded in the formal sample used in this cross-cultural study were the !KungBushmen of southwest Africa. Their shamanistic healer (the Num master) wasempirically classified as a shaman, with selection, training, and healing activitiescorresponding to the classic phenomena of shamanism. The medicine dance ofthe Num master and the !Kung Bushmen (the topic of articles [L. Marshall1962, 1969] and a book [Katz 1982]) occurs in the context of their communalhealing activities, which involve all-night sessions in which the men as healersdance to the incessant singing and clapping accompaniment provided by women.The extensive dancing is thought to activate an energy source that is then trans-ferred to patients. Spirits are pleaded with or commanded in an effort to obtaintheir assistance in the cure of illness. These ceremonies occur on an irregularbasis. Although the more recent reports of the healing ceremony (Katz 1982) sug-gested that it does not involve drug ingestion, earlier observations (Marshall1962, 1969; cf. film N/um Tchai: The Ceremonial Dance of the !Kung Bushmen[J. Marshall 1969]) showed the useof psychoactive substances, particularly forhealers in training. Assessment of published data on pharmacological propertiesof the !Kung Bushmen medicine plantsshowed that the vast majority haveevidence of being psychoactive (Winkelman and Dobkin de Rios 1989). Thecharacteristics of the !Kung Bushman Num master in twentieth-century Africaare strikingly similar to the characteristics of the classic descriptions of theshaman found around the world. This similarity is not explained by diffusion(Winkelman 1986a, 1992). The fundamental similarity across time and culturesindicates that shamanism develops from a common psychobiological basis andits adaptive consequences. These universal and cross-cultural characteristics ofshamans reflect biosocial and neurognostic structures that constitute the primor-dial basis for religion.58SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The “Shamanism Controversy”The concept of the shaman as an etic explanatory framework has been part of theintellectual climate of the Western world since it entered into mainstream literarydiscourses in the 1700s (Flaherty 1992). When Eliade published his famousShamanism Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy(1964, originally 1951 in French) itwas a concept already familiar to the educated Westerner. Soon, descriptions offoreign religious practices around the world were communicated through theconcept of the shaman.The effort to convey the concept of the shaman was derived in part from aneffort to explain the behavior of the “other” to the Westerner; it fell into disreputeas a wave of cultural anthropologists began to question and criticize the use of theterm. The complaints as variously expressed made several points:1. There is no similarity in spiritual or healing practices around the world;2. The concept of the shaman is a fabrication of the Western imagination,a New Age phenomenon and construction; and3. The spiritual healing practices found cross-culturally vary and reflect localcultural concepts, negating any claims to a universal shamanism.Kehoe legitimately criticizes Eliade’s failure to use systematic cross-culturalresearch to arrive at his conclusions regarding shamanism, accusing him of a racisttreatment of the primitive other. Although Eliade’s impressionistic and selectivemethods deserve criticism from the perspectives of modern ethnological research,his conclusions were, nonetheless, on target, as illustrated in Winkelman’s(1986a, 1990, 1992) cross-cultural research. This research is in general ignored,however, by those who reject the concept of shamanism as a cross-culturalconcept (e.g., Francfort, Hamayon, and Bahn [2001]; Helvenston and Bahn[2003]). This idea that shamanism might explain the structure of phenomena ofthe past has been considered controversial to the point of ridicule. Bahn denoun-ces “shamaniacs” in arguments against those who examine the relationship ofPaleolithic art to shamanism and altered states of consciousness. Helvenstonand Bahn’s arguments have been influential, but have little substance. Many oftheir claims are faulty and erroneous and are rejected in detail by Lewis-Williams and Whitley (Lewis-Williams 2004; Lewis-Williams and Pearce2005; Whitley 2009; also see Clottes [2004]; Pearce [2004]; Lewis-Williams[2006]; Whitley [2006]).In various publications, Bahn rejects what he calls “a spurious neuropsycho-logical model” of shamanism. His arguments and data, however, are focused onthe inadequacy of shamanic theory for explaining all of rock art. Such claims werenever made by those he criticizes. What Bahn and his colleagues (e.g., Francfort,Hamayon, and Bahn [2001]; Helvenstonand Bahn [2003]) do is criticize theirown misconceptions, misunderstandings, and misrepresentations rather thanthe actual ideas presented (for details see Clottes [2004]; Pearce [2004]; Lewis-Williams [2006]; Whitley [2006]). Furthermore, their arguments are misleadingTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM59"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"and their presentation of the facts is often grossly distorted to defend their pointsof view and discount the evidence for these hypotheses.Whitely (2006, 2009) has pointed out abundant evidence to confront Bahn’sclaims about the supposed inadequacies of the neuropsychology models of sha-manism. Bahn’s considerations did nottouch directly on the biological natureof altered states or the cross-cultural similarities in shamanistic practices. Andwherehedoesaddressthealteredstatesissues,heiswrong.Forinstance,herepeatedly contends that the phosphenes and entoptic phenomena found inmescaline-induced altered states have no relevance to other altered states inducedwithout drugs. But as Whitley’s (2006) review illustrates, the experiences inducedby the psychedelics can also be produced by the natural phenomena of sensorydeprivation produced by isolation in caves.This practice of ignoring relevant research and misrepresenting their owndata is front and center in the articles in Francfort, Hamayon, and Bahn’s(2001) edited collectionThe Concept of Shamanism: Uses and Abuses. In Hamayon’sintroduction, he despaired that “the question of what shamanism really is in thefinal analysis has hindered all attempts to define it,” but he ignores the literatureand the more relevant research that describes the empirical characteristics associ-ated with shamanism cross-culturally. Most crucially, Hamayon obviously hadaccess to material establishing the etic status of shamanism, because included inhis references is Winkelman’s (1992)Shamans, Priests, and Witches. A Cross-cultural Study of Magico-Religious Practices. Hamayon, however, did not actuallyrefer to the monograph or its ideas in his article. In his introduction to a later sec-tion, Francfort sagely noted, “Archaeologists and art historians look to ethnolo-gists for an operational definition [of shamanism]” (43). But he made noconsideration of the ethnological research characterizing cross-cultural similaritiesand differences in shamanistic practices or the empirical cross-culturally validcharacterizations of shamanism.Similarly, Hamayon (6) claimed that “all papers in this section refute this‘theory’ ”—referring to the idea that shamanism involves an inner dispositionto altered states of consciousness. But what is actually covered in those chapters?Nothing in this introduction nor in Francfort’s introduction to the “PrehistoricSection” indicated why we should not find the bases of shamanism in alteredstates of consciousness. Arguments against such claims that Francfort presentedare focused on the variability of shamanism in practice and definition; such vari-ability has no bearing on the arguments regarding the brain and neuropsycho-logical systems, their relationships to altered states of consciousness, and theorigination of the shamanism in such experiences.Part of Bahn’s and others’ arguments are based in an arbitrary approach to con-ceptualizing shamanism. For instance, Bahn characterizes Siberia as “the heartlandof true shamanism” (59), resorting to the idea that the word must be restricted tothe cultural region of its origin. Restricting use of the term shaman to the culturesfrom which it derived makes as much sense as refusing to extend such terms astaboo,mana,kula ring,latah, or many other anthropological concepts outside oftheir cultures of origin. When similar concepts are found cross-culturally, termi-nology must be appropriated to convey the similarity found in diverse places.60SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"While arguing that “non-shamanic ‘primitive’ societies’ [such as] Australia, NewGuinea and the Andaman Islands...contradict (once more) the idea of a similargeneral shamanism for early societies” (37), Francfort follows with a direct contra-diction in arguing that “if we look at these societies with a loose definition in mind[unspecified]...we can take them to be shamanic too....This shows the inad-equacy of the ‘general shamanic theory’ approach” (37). This contradiction and lackof reasoning do not show any general shamanic theories to be inadequate. Further-more, Quelle’s (2001, 148) article in that section, rather than refuting a cross-cultural shamanism, claimed that “true shamanism is only conceivable there[Africa] in the case of the Thonga and the San.” The universality of shamanismreported in Winkelman’s cross-cultural research included the San (Kung Bushman)practices, which were empirically classified as involving shamanism.How can the reality of a valid concept of the shamanism continue to bedenied in light of the empirical evidence? In the above-cited cases, it is most sim-ply by grossly distorting the claims and arguments and ignoring the relevant data,failing to even consider this cross-cultural research. When I asked Alice Kehoewhy she did not consider my cross-cultural research on shamanism in her cri-tique of the cross-cultural validity of the concept of the shaman, she retorted,“Consider yourself lucky!” I suppose she is the one to be lucky enough to havethe kind of critical thinking skills that allow her to completely ignore the evidenceagainst her argument.The Weakness of the “Shaman in the Cave” ArgumentsThere also are several problems in the evidence previously presented for under-standing shamanism as a cross-cultural and biological phenomenon. One derivesfrom conceptual problems regarding the specific characteristics of shamans ofancient hunter-gatherer societies and how they are related to spiritual healers inmore complex societies. This can be resolved by the sociocultural evolution model(see below) and the distinguishing characteristics of different types of shamanistichealers (see Table 2.1). A second source of problems regarding arguments of sha-manic roles in the Middle/Upper Paleolithicis in the weakness of the evidencepresented justifying shamanic interpretationsof Paleolithic art. Lewis-Williams(2002, 2006; Clottes and Lewis-Williams 1998; Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005)exemplified the tendency to defend the thesis of shamanism in the Paleolithic withreference toethnographicexamples. This notion that we can establish the patternsof the past with ethnographic analogy is unfortunately still a dominant theoreticalapproach in the archaeology of ritual (Fogelin 2007). A specific ethnographic casein the present or historical past of something called shamanism has little power inestablishing its presence in other time or place. What can establish the prehistoryand antiquity of shamanism?Winkelman (2002a; also see 2008b, 2009a) proposed that there should bethree major pillars for this argument:1. Cross-cultural ethnological patterns of shamanic practitioners in premodernsocieties that establish a base for an ethnological analogy;THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM61"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"2. Direct homologies between shamanic practices and the ritual patterns ofother animals, particularly our primate cousins; and3. A neuropsychological explanation for the correspondences of shamanicpractices with aspects of the brain involved in altered states of consciousness.Unfortunately, to-date most archaeologists engaged in the argument for thepresence of shamanism in the past have not relied on this kind of evidence anddocumentation for their arguments. Establishing that rock art of specific regionsis linked to shamanic practice and production does benefit from ethnographicresearch establishing such connections. And such connections, by ethnographicanalogy, might be used to infer the shamanic context of Paleolithic art. Butthis ethnographic analogy is not sufficient. What we need is evidence of cross-cultural patterns of shamanism, a series of universal principles of hunter-gatherer religiosity and spirituality that allow us to infer with certainty its presencein the human past.In Lewis-Williams’s work (e.g., 2002; Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005) forinstance, there is to-date a general failure to use any systematic cross-cultural datato support his argument. Instead he engages in a subjective practice of pickingsocieties that have interesting shamanistic practices as an example of how tointerpret the past. Lewis-Williams assumes that we know what shamanism is, thatit is unproblematic, that it can be compiled haphazardly from ethnographic cases,and that it corresponds to whatever lists of features he presents (and occasionallymodifies). Lewis-Williams does us a disservice in obfuscating efforts to under-stand shamanism by ignoring relevant cross-cultural research, for instanceBourguignon’s (1976) research on the importance of differences between posses-sion and other trance states, and Winkelman’s (1986b, 1990, 1992) researchestablishing that shamans are not possessed. This is most unfortunate, since hehas been aware of this cross-cultural research since the 1980s (Lewis-Williamsand Dowson 1988).The use of the term “shaman” without an empirical grounding and for a widerange of diverse religious practitioners makes its use problematic. The underlyingissues include whether the concept of the shaman is strictly emic, related only to aparticular culture or region (e.g., Paleosiberia); whether shamanism constitutes anetic or universal phenomenon found cross-culturally; or whether shamanism is amodern invention, a New Age concept without parallel in the premodern world.Cross-cultural research methods are indispensable tools for empirically address-ing these questions and establishing the nature of shamanism. These kind of nec-essary cross-cultural studies of magico-religious practitioners were publishedmore than two decades ago (Winkelman 1984, 1986a&b, 1990, 1992). The empir-ical cross-cultural research summarized above establishes the basis for ashamanicparadigmand validates the nature of an aboriginal hunter-gatherer shamanismworldwide. It also provides a basis for distinguishing an aboriginal shamanismfrom other forms of shamanistic healing that emerged from that basis as a conse-quence of the processes of sociocultural evolution.This is a major part of the conceptual problem regarding the question ofwhat is shamanism, the relationship of an ancient hunter-gatherer phenomenon62SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"to the diversity of related phenomena in more complex societies. Although man-ifestations of shamanic potentials differ, they nonetheless reflect a transcendentreality based in human biological potentials. These potentials take different man-ifestations in the different types of shamanistic healers, which reflect the effects ofdifferent subsistence and political conditions that accompanied socioculturalevolution.The Sociocultural Evolution of Shamanic PotentialsA broader group of practitioners—shamanistic healers—manifests shamanicpotentials but also reflects their adaptation todifferent ecological, subsistence,and social conditions. Cross-cultural analyses (Winkelman 1986a, 1990, 1992)illustrate this evolution in the systematic relationships of shamanistic healersand other magico-religious practitioners to subsistence conditions and socialcomplexity. The relevant socioeconomic conditions underlying the evolution ofshamanic healers involve: (1) the absence/presence of hunting and gathering ver-sus agriculture as the major source of subsistence; (2) fixity of residence(nomadic versus sedentary lifestyle); (3) political integration beyond the level ofthe local community; and (4) social stratification (classes and castes/hereditaryslavery). These relationships of socioeconomic conditions to forms of magico-religious practice were established as being independent of diffusion throughuse of autocorrelation multiple-regression procedures (Dow, Burton, White,and Reitz 1984; see Winkelman [1992]).These associations of magico-religious practitioners with social complexityconditions indicate that macro- or general evolutionary processes are responsiblefor the disappearance of the shaman and the emergence of other types of shaman-istic healers. Based on an integration of this information with data on practitionerselection procedures and professional functions, Winkelman (1992) proposed amodel of the evolution of magico-religious functions, which involves these princi-pal bases: (1) a psychobiological dynamic of shamanistic healers derived from thealteration of consciousness; (2) the role of social leadership, manifested in priests;and (3) the conflict between these two dimensions, reflected in the concepts ofsorcery and witchcraft. These relationships ofsocioeconomic conditions tomagico-religious practitioners are illustrated in Figure 2.1.Explaining Universals of ShamanismThe role of the shaman, with a similar complex of characteristics, activities, andbeliefs, is found in widely separated societies. The universality of the basic prac-tices and experiences related to shamanism is substantiated by the convergenceof the findings of Winkelman’s 1992 study with other research on shamanisticpractices. Specific universals include those emphasized by Eliade (1964): altera-tions of consciousness (ecstatic experiences); an interaction with the spiritualworld; and community rituals, as well as other universal features of shamanismsuch as visionary and dream experiences, the soul journey, animal identities,and death-rebirth experience.THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM63"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Cross-cultural similarities in shamanism could have resulted from diffusionof a single tradition, as La Barre (1970) and Furst (1976) suggested with respectto the Eurasian origins of North American shamanism. The worldwide presenceof shamans in this formal cross-cultural sample in such widely varying linguisticgroups as the Click (!Kung), Paleosiberian (Samoyed), Mon-Khmer (Semang),and North American Indian languages indicates that the diffusion hypothesiswould have to postulate a very ancient origin group. This hypothesis regardingthe worldwide distribution of shamanism as a consequence of the processes ofdiffusion is rejected by autocorrelation analysis (Winkelman 1986a); the absenceof shamans in some regions of the worldwide sample is related to the absencethere of nomadic hunter-gatherer societies.Independent invention must be considered in the origin and the worldwidedistribution of shamanism, derived from psychobiological potentials that pro-vided adaptive responses. Psychobiological perspectives can explain interrelatedfindings about shamans, specifically: (1) the worldwide distribution of a specificconstellation of characteristics found in the role of shamans in hunter-gatherersocieties; (2) the alteration of consciousness as the focus of shamanistic practices;and (3) the universal roles of shamanistic healers in divination and healing.Shamans’ ancient world-wide presence in hunter-gatherer societies illus-trates that it involves an ecologically and socially determined “type of religion”(Hultkrantz 1966). Hultkrantz modeled this “type of religion” on Steward’s(1955) notion of “types of culture” reflecting the basic stages of socioculturalevolution (bands, tribes, chiefdoms, states). A type of religion “contains thosereligious patterns and features which belong to or are intimately associated withthe cultural core and therefore arise out of environmental adaptations”(Hultkrantz 1966, 146). The worldwide similarity in shamans derives from thepsychobiological bases of human consciousness and its adaptation to social andecological conditions of hunter-gatherer societies. This is possible because thealterations of consciousness basic to selection, training, and professional activitiesoccur spontaneously under a wide variety of circumstances—injury, extremefatigue, near starvation, and as a consequence of a wide variety of deliberate64SHAMANISMFIGURE 2.1Practitioner Types, Biosocial Bases, and SocioeconomicConditions"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"procedures (see Chapter 4). Consequently, shamanism was reinvented or redis-covered in diverse cultures because these experiences provided important adap-tive capabilities. These are derived from their usefulness in meeting challengesto survival, including healing through stress reduction and other physiologicalchanges that enhance systemic integration of the information-processing strataof the brain (see Chapter 5).SummaryShamanism is a part of our evolved psychology involving potentialsassociated with the alteration of consciousness and its effects on human emotionsand cognition. Evidence for the biological basis is already provided in (1) the uni-versal distribution of similarly characterized shamans in hunter-gatherer soci-eties; and (2) the lack of evidence of diffusion. The following sections of thischapter provide further evidence of our shamanic past by showing the roots ofshamanism in ancient religious concepts of many languages; evidence of the pres-ence of shamanism at the origins of modern human cultures; and the adaptivefeatures of shamanism that promoted the evolution of human consciousnessand society. The subsequent chapters will show how shamanic experiences con-tributed to cognitive evolution through the effects of shamanic activities on thebasic structures of consciousness (Chapter 3); the adaptive functions of the inte-grative mode of consciousness (Chapter 4); the therapeutic effects of shamanisticactivities (Chapter 5); and the derivation of the evolutionary origins of shamanichealing from primate ritual structures by extending their integrative and commu-nicative capacities (Chapter 6).LINGUISTIC ROOTS AND SURVIVALS OF SHAMANISMIN INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGESShamanic practices were so fundamental to diverse aspects of hunter-gatherersocieties that multiple referents remained embedded in language after shamanismdisappeared as a consequence of sociocultural evolution to other forms of shaman-istic and magico-religious practitioners. To date, etymological inquiry into theIndo-European (I-E) term for shaman is inconclusive. The termshamanwas notpart of historical English but was borrowed from the Tungus of Siberia via Russianand German (Flaherty 1992). In the Tungus language the term for shaman has beenrecorded asc ̧saman,sama,saman,shaman,s ́aman,samman,andkhamman(Laufer 1917; Hultkrantz 1977); it is also recorded in the Tungus-Manchu andTurko-Tartar languages ass ́am,csam,kam,xam,xamna-,andxamsa-.Ne ́meth(1913) argued that these are the phonetic equivalent of the Turkishkam(xam)and the Yakut terms (xamna-,xamsa-), which mean “to move, to be agitated, tostep, to stride.” Campbell (1983) suggested the Tungusic root of the term maybe derived from the Tunguso-Manchurian verbsˆa, “to know.”Such derivations suggest that there would be no cognates with shaman inEnglish or other I-E languages, but I propose that the evidence indicates other-wise, that shamanic concepts are widespread in the ancient religious roots ofI-E languages. This is not a conventional position; the I-E languages appear toTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM65"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"lack common linguistic roots related to religion and spirituality, much lessshamanism. “[D]esignation of the ‘sacred’ confronts us with a strange linguisticsituation: the absence of any specific term in common Indo-European...nocommon term to designate religion itself, or cult, or the priest, not even one ofthe personal gods” (Benveniste 1973, 445–46). In I-E languages, “[t]he only thingwhich could be credited to the original community would be the idea of ‘god’...attested in the form*deiwos, the sense of which is ‘luminous’ and ‘celestial’ ”(Benveniste, 446).Ancient (and historical) I-E repressions of shamanic practices may beresponsible for obscuring a common I-E root for the sacred. Mythological sour-ces attest to the presence of ancient I-E shamanic activities (Eliade 1964). Eliadepointed to evidence of the existence of ancient shamanism and its vestiges inI-E myths. “[T]he shamanic traditions were principally grouped about the myth-ical figure of the terrifying Sovereign, whose archetype seems to be Varuna, theMaster of Magic, the great ‘Binder’ ” (Eliade 1974, 379). There are extensive refer-ents to shamanistic activities in the later developments in Buddhism, as well asthe remnants of earlier shamanistic practices referred to in the Buddhist doctrinesasyaksha(Sanskrityaksaand Paliyakka). These are “beings mentioned in theBuddhist canon who are divine in nature and possess and supernatural powers”(Fischer-Schreiber, Ehrhard, and Diener 1991). This shamanistic root is alsofound in Buddhism: thesamyak-sambuddhais a “fully awakened one” and theyashaare Buddhist councils.Lack of evidence for I-E roots for religious concepts also reflects the lack of aparadigm for interpreting the evidence about religious language in the past; theshamanic paradigm can help make sense of what have been disconnected con-cepts. Winkelman’s (1992) cross-cultural model of magico-religious practicesshows systematic relationships of socioeconomic and political conditions to thenature and forms of magico-religious practice. This etic model can interpretand organize data about earlier forms of religious practice found among I-E.Indo-European Magico-Religious Linguistic RootsThe lack of a recognized referent to shamanism in I-E is reflective of the problem-atic nature of the concept of the sacred in I-E. Benveniste pointed out that inaddition to absence of any specific term for religious concerns, there was acommon twofold designation in many I-E languages. This was attested to in theLatinsacerandsanctus,theGothichailsandweihs, and the Greekhiere ́osandhe ́agios. Benveniste posited a double prehistoric meaning for the sacred: “positive‘what is charged with divine presence,’ and negative ‘what is forbidden for men tocontact’ ” (445). Latin manifests this ambiguous meaning of sacred: “consecratedto god and affected with an ineradicable pollution, august and accursed, worthyof veneration and evoking horror” (452). “A man who is called sacer is stainedwith a real pollution which puts him outside human society” (453). The com-bined negative and positive aspects of the sacred may trouble those who viewthe sacred as only good; however, the ambiguous meaning may reflect the posi-tive and negative aspects of shamans, their ability to both heal and kill.66SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Sacred (sak-) and the Holy (kailo)Morris (1981) pointed out thatsak-, with meanings of “sanctify” and “sacred,” isa widespread and ancient I-E root pertaining to religion.

The religion of ancient India was generally subsumed by thefrequently compounded wordssamana-bra ̄hmana(Pali) ors ́ramana-bra ̄hmana(Sanskrit) (Wayman 1969–71). Thebra ̄hmanarepresented the institutionalizedbureaucratic and political aspects of religious practice, and thes ́aman or s ́ramanareflected the shamanic basis. “Abraˆhmanawas a person leading a religious lifewhile adhering to the orthodox life of social stages, which became standardizedas the four stages in Hinduism; and as ́ramanawas a person guarding his sanctitywhile not committed to the orthodox social stages of Brahamanic society” (395).The Buddha was referred to as the “greats ́ramana,” or “great ascetic.”An earlier root for the Sanskrit term is the Pali word for a religious specialist—samana(Wayman 1969–71), also represented ass ́ramana,sˆramana,sˆra ́mana,cramana,andsˆramanaˆ(Hultkrantz 1977; Mironov and Shirokogoroff 1924).Another possible cognate is illustrated in the term for a hermit and divine beingwith supernatural power, referred to asyaksha(Fischer-Schreiber, Ehrhard, andDiener 1991). The centrality of this root is seen in the reference ofsˆramanato aBuddhist monk, literally meaning an ascetic, self-tormenter, or religious person.One proposed derivation ofsˆramanais from the roots ́ram, “to be (become)weary, to exert one’s self (especially in performing acts of austerity)” (MironovTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM67"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"and Shirokogoroff 1924, 107).

The findings presented below are derivedfromA Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically and Philologically Arranged withSpecial Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages(Monier-Williams 1872,1899; republished 1974)._Sais closely related toshaandsa(sh), forming a class of three sibilants(Monier-Williams 1974, 1107) with core meanings that have shamanic associa-tions._Sahas meanings of prosody, meter, and music; a snake or bird; air, wind,and the gods Vishnu and Siva; knowledge and meditation; procuring and bestow-ing; the intellect; and as a term to refer topurusha, the universal soul (Monier-Williams, 1111).Shameans best, excellent, learned; loss, destruction; loss ofknowledge; end; rest, remainder; eternal happiness, final emancipation; heaven,paradise; sleep; a learned man, and teacher.Shaalso refers to the six duties ofBrahmans, the six acts allowed to a Brahmin householder as a means of subsis-tence, and the six acts of the practice of the yogi.Buddhist meditative practices have a number of additional meanings associ-ated with the prefix rootsa. (The following are largely derived from Fischer-Schreiber, Ehrhard, and Diener.)Sramana(Buddhistshramanaand Palisamanna) originally was applied to those who led an ascetic life, and later becameapplied to a Buddhist monk.Sramanera(Sanskrit) refers to the novices commit-ted to following the obligations, precepts and ethical guidelines for Buddhistmonks and nuns.Samgharefers to the community of Buddhists.Shakyareferstothe noble clan of Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), andsamyak-sambuddha(Palisamma-buddha) means a fully awakened or enlightened individual.Samskarasrefers to mental formations and mental impulses, whilesamskritarefers to “allinterdependent and mutually conditioning phenomena” (Fischer-Schreiber et al.,184). The forms of consciousness that are the focus of the contemplative tradi-tions are known in Buddhism assamadhis, involving the process of entering intodeeper layers of one’s own consciousness.Samadhiinvolves the focused concen-tration of the mind, meditative absorption, unity, totality, and total concentrationof spirit.68SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The material in Monier-Williams also revealed shamanistic activities refer-enced by words with the prefix_Sa, including those meaning hymns, songs, invoca-tions, curses, and prayer; vows, oaths, predictions, and prognostications; blessingsand curses, wishing well or ill; to supplicate, conjure, or exorcise demons; omensand auguries, especially related to knowledge of birds; ritual acts and power; hymnof song or praise, chanting sacred text or verse; worship together; and offer sacri-fice. The multiple uses ofsaroots in aspects central to the meditative traditionsand their associated meanings tie them to a common conceptual frameworkrelated to the shamanic complex. This includes divination in many forms, sacrificeand worship, and a range of attributes directly related to shamanism, includingchanting, singing, music, and psychodramatic enactments with the spirit world,particularly vows, conjuring spirits, and supplications used for healing.Benveniste (1973, 448) offered a reconstruction of the I-E prototype of sacredin the root*k’wen(*k ’eu), which is expressed in the adjectival form as*kailosinthe Slavic, Germanic, and Celtic. The concept of “holy” expressed in the I-E rootkailo-means “whole, uninjured, or good omen” (Morris 1981, 1520). The I-E rootofkailo-iska-, meaning “to like, desire.” It is attested to in Old English derivativeforms, including holy, hallowed, and whole. Kailo is the root of the English termssuch as heal and health. Its suffixed forms (e.g.,kan) have shamanic and magico-religious meanings, including “to sing,” “to cast a spell, to enchant, to charm,”and “incantation” (Shipley 1984).The many ancient and contemporary meanings associated with the rootsapoint to shamanic origins. Understanding these as well as a diversity of otherreferents to shamanistic phenomena requires a framework. The socioculturalevolutionary model of magico-religious practitioners presented above has directcorrespondences to religious structures of I-E societies, and the ancient Hindusocial-religious structures in particular. This helps to identify a wide range ofreferents and their ancient linguistic roots.Magico-Religious Structuresin Indo-European SocietiesThere were remnants of the shamanic practices, but shamanism was not foundamong the early Indo-Europeans (Eliade 1953). This is because the I-E tripartiteorganization of religious life and society postulated by Dume ́zil (see Littleton[1982]) was “already basically accomplished at a period when the Indo-Europeans had not yet separated” (Eliade 1974, 378). Even at the proto-I-E stage,the societal and religious structures already replaced shamanism. The agriculturalsubsistence and political complexity of early I-E society indicate that the originalshamanic practices would have already been replaced by priests and other sha-manistic healers, as reflected in the classic tripartite division of proto-I-E society(as represented within India):1. priest (brahman)2. warrior (ksattriyas)3. farmer, villager or clansman (vaisya)THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM69"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The tripartite I-E structure emphasizes the influences of the priest, but none-theless recognizes shamanic roots. While thebraˆhmanarepresented the priest andthe bureaucratic and political aspects of the religious practice, thes ́ramanaorsamanareflected the shamanic basis. The tripartite structure Dume ́zil identifiedwas considered a uniquely I-E phenomenon, but the wider distributions of thistripartite model (see Figure 2.1) suggest that it be explained in terms of the causaleffects that social structural features have upon religious ideologies and practices.The tripartite model of I-E society posited by Dume ́zil does not account for a sha-manic basis nor its social representations and transformations and has been rec-ognized as needing expansion (Allen1996) to explicate shamanic origins,interrelationships among divisions, and developmental changes. Problems inthe origins and development of the tripartite division of I-E society can be clari-fied by relating them to the cross-cultural structures of stages of development ofreligious practitioners and their sociocultural transformation. The recognitionof the primordial role of the shaman as a universally distributed religious special-ist, and the transformation of shamans as a consequence of socioeconomic andpolitical evolution, provides a basis for interpreting the relationships among I-Edeities, entities, and ideological forces.Roots of Indo-European MedicineZysk (1992) reviewed Indo-Germanic and I-E medicine to identify their roots andrelationships to the tripartite division of I-E society. Benveniste’s (1945) analysis ofI-E medicine concluded that there were both specialized relationships to the tripar-tite division and an ambivalent social attitude towards those practices that could beused to both heal and harm. Puhvel (1970) also proposed that the healing systemwas related to the tripartite ideology. Medicine of the priestly class was representedby Varuna’s prayer healings for ritual cures. The healing or medicine associated withthe warrior functions involved procedures for dealing with wounds and epidemics.The third division (vaisya) was clearly the most significant of the three in terms ofhealing.Vaisyawas represented by the Ashvins, who used a folk medicine based inherbs and spells and were general healing practitioners (Puhvel, 371). The minorsovereign Indo-Iranian gods of the Hindus—Daksha, Amsha, Asha, Sraosha, andAshi—whose names include “sh”—apparently reflect this basis. Zysk points out thatthe popular traditions associated with thevaisyadivision incorporated influencesfrom non-I-E cultures, leading the Hindu class system to keep the shamanic prac-tices outside of proper society, such as the god Puˆshan, associated with the non-Aryanshuˆdras. The remnants of the shamanic practices associated with thevaisyasare repressed. In Hindu mythology, thebrahmansand thekshatriyasjoin againstthevaisyasbecause they do not want to admit the latter’s gods, the Ashvins, to thesacrifices and allow them to partake ofsoma. Zysk affirms Puhvel’s identificationof this folk medicine with thevaisya, reflecting the ties of herbal medicine to agricul-ture. The identification of thevaisyadivision with the shamanic roots also hasetymological grounds, asvaisya’sI-Erootweik-has prominent meanings associatedwith magico-religious practice.70SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Weik-as a Shamanic RootWeik-is an I-E root with widespread use as a referent to magico-religious prac-tice, but it is not generally considered in the context of the sacred and religious.This reflects its representation of the negative and devalued aspects of the super-natural. The I-E rootweik-is the source of witchcraft, wizard, sacrificial victim,and other magico-religious terms. The etymology and uses of the term “witch”in I-E languages illustrate direct relations to shamanism. The I-E rootweik-hasfive general meanings (Morris 1981, 1548):1. “clan (social unit above the household). The zero-grade form*wik-inSanskrit is vis, dwelling, house, with derivativevaisya, settler”; this representsthe third dimension of Dume ́zil’s tripartite social scheme;2. “words connected with magic and religious notions” such as divination,wizard, bewitch, and animals used as sacrificial victims;3. “To be like...likeness, image, icon,” are meanings connected with the sha-manistic and magical use of enactment and the fundamental role of imageryin shamans’ visionary experiences;4. “To bend, wind...turn” are meanings associated by Eliade (1953) withroots of I-E shamanism in Varuna, the master of magic, who was known asthe “Great Binder”; and5. “To conquer,” a meaning related to both the shamans’ battle with spirits andtheir hunter/warrior role, as well as reflecting the second dimension of theI-E tripartite division—the warriors (kshatriyas).These roots ofwitchhave little association with the contemporary or histori-cal meanings of the word. They do, however, have substantial relations to shaman-istic activities. The shaman is the group (clan) leader, reflecting the shaman’spreeminent role in the collective functions of hunter-gatherer societies. Conceptsof divination and images are directly related to shamanistic activities, with mean-ings of “likeness” and “image” reflecting enactment and imitation (e.g., Frazer’s[1890] Law of Similarity or Imitation). The meanings “bend” and “wind” reflectdirect connections with the roots of I-E shamanism, as identified by Eliade(1964) in Varuna, the master of magic, who was known as the “Great Binder.”The meaning “conquer” appears more distant to the hunter/warrior role of theshaman, reflecting a meaning also found in the rootka.Shamanic Elements in Origins of Mystical TraditionsThe terms for the ecstatic aspects of Hindu monks and priests (the Palisamanaand Sanskritsra ́mana) point to the shamanic roots of Hindu religious practices.Eliade pointed to an “identity in expressionbetween such superhuman experien-ces and the archaic symbolism of ascent and flight” (Eliade 1953, 409). Other sha-manic characteristics are found in the yoga power techniques, orsiddhis,themiracles and feats of the yogis, and terminology associated with Buddhas andTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM71"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"saints. The origin of Hindu and Buddhist practices in shamanic tradition are alsoattested to by a range of functional and linguistic similarities.Similarities between the shamanic and yogic traditions are found in thepowers or capabilities of thesiddhis, which are acquired by the yogi as aby-product of ascetic practices. These abilities also attributed to shamans includeclairvoyance and psychic knowledge of past, present, and future; communicationwith distant places and persons; visions of distant scenes and of activities on otherplanes of existence; immunity to heat and fire; the ability to read and control theminds of others; control of animals; traveling in mental or etheric form; materiali-zation and dematerialization; abnormal or unusual control of bodily functions;healing by touch or at a distance; and the separation or unification of soul andbody (Evans-Wentz 1978; Gupta 1961; Wood 1948). Another shamanic techniquewhich parallels that of the yogis is the mastery of heat and fire and production ofinner heat. The production of this inner heat is associated with the experience oflight or illumination, which Eliade pointed out is a core metaphor for both sha-manic and yogic experience and development.InYoga: Freedom and Immortality, Eliade (1969) explored the relationshipsbetween shamans and yogis to establish the extent to which the shaman is theprogenitor of the yogic and meditative traditions. Eliade pointed out thatshamanic characteristics are found in the mythology, folklore, and religious tradi-tions associated with yoga. In Eliade’s assessment of the shamanistic influencesupon yoga, the following shamanic characteristics are of primary importance:(1) initiation involving symbolic dismemberment, death, and resurrection;(2) ecstatic journeys; (3) mastery of heat and fire; and (4) assumption of animalforms.Eliade characterized the frequent fakiricsiddhireferred to as the “rope trick”as evidence of shamanic influences on the yogic traditions. The rope trick typi-cally involves the yogi rising into the air, undergoing dismemberment, followedby a rejoining of the limbs of the body. This embodies shamanic elements ofthe initiatory rite of death and rebirth and the ascent into the heavens. Yogisand other ascetics acquire the power offlight represented in symbols of ascentto heaven.Eliade concluded that shamanic activities were homologized with yoga andthat this magico-religious stratum, which preceded yoga, continued to exist con-terminously with the yogic practices both within and outside of India. Althoughyoga incorporated and preserved the contributions of these ancient traditions,Eliade’s summary comments suggested the shamanic contributions were at thedegraded margins of yoga and the meditative traditions, rather than their primaryprogenitors.Cross-cultural research and linguistic evidence, however, suggest shamanismwas the basis from which the yogic and meditative traditions developed. The rela-tionship of the mystical traditions to shamanic roots is illustrated by the abun-dant connections between the two in language roots and mythology. Therelationships of terms for shamanic practitioners in Sanskrit and Pali (saman)to words used to refer to Buddhist practices illustrate that shamanic referentsand practices were the direct progenitors of the mystical, meditative, and yogic72SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"traditions. The meanings ofs ́ramana—tired, fatigued, and weary—are inconsis-tent with Buddhistic practice and the quiet contemplative states of the Buddhistmonks, but they do accurately portray activities and conditions typical of sha-manistic practices (e.g., dancing, drumming, chanting, and singing to the pointof exhaustion and collapse). There are major differences between the actual activ-ities of yogis and the activities and conditions implied in the roots of the termsused to refer to them; this indicates yogic origins in activities quite different fromtheir later characteristics. While the yogi does not engage in physical exertion as apart of meditative practices, the shaman does. This apparent inconsistency ofreferent and meaning in words used to refer to the yogi is resolved by recognizingthe shamanic origins of their traditions.Reasons for the shamanic developments into meditative practices weresuggested by Harner (1982; cf. Doore 1988), who hypothesized that the rise ofcity-states prompted the development of yogic practices because the drummingassociated with shamanism attracted repression from the official religions (priest-hoods). The repression carried out by state religions of Asia against the meditativeand mystical traditions, includingBuddhism, has been widely documented(Fischer-Schreiber, Ehrhard, and Diener 1991). The silent yogic practices allowedfor a secretive persistence of ASC activities in contexts where they were not officiallypermitted.Linguistic Origins of “Shaman”Ancient I-E terms used to refer to shamanistic activities coalesce around threeprimary sets of consonants and their alternate forms:w(v),k(c), ands(sh).These different forms reflect linguistic sound shifts and the evolutionary of termi-nology across time; I will leave the formal arguments for the linguists. The simi-larities suggest that the radical root referring to the shaman provided a basis fordiverse developments as societies evolved from hunting and gathering to morecomplex subsistence and social patterns. Expressions of these shamanic referentsin thew,k, andssounds are also found in the basic tripartite division of proto-I-Esociety (i.e., India) into the farmer or clansman (vaisya), warrior (ksatriya), andpriest/hermit (bhraman/samana).Theshamanictermsassociatedwiththesoundsofw(orv)arefoundinexamples such as witch, wizard, wisdom, wise, vision, aware, awake, will, andtheTeutonicgodWoden(Odin).Thesearetheearliestrepresentations.Theshamanic survivals associated with thekasound are found in cant, cantor, chant,knowledge, consciousness, gnosis, and kannabis and include combinations of thesandksounds (e.g., scalpumancy). A later stratum of shamanic roots is associ-ated with thessound and manifested in English terms such as sage, saint, satan,sacred, sacerdotal, sacrifice, and savant. Other possible shaman-relatedshwordsinclude sham and shame; shade (as in ghost, spirit); shammatize (excommunica-tion, to destroy and curse); and shamade (drum beat for a parley).Shamblehasold meanings of “a table or counter for sale of goods or meat,” “a place whereanimals are killed,” and “to cut up or slaughter and dispose of a corpse.” Mostof these meanings have to do with animals, a core concern of the shaman, whoTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM73"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"provides “hunting magic” and is considered to be a master of the animals. Theimplications of dismemberment also have direct relationship to the shamanicarchetypal processes of death and rebirth.Shamblealso means “an ungainly awk-ward or unsteady walk, an irregular gait or motion,” an analogy to the shaman’sdance.The prototype ofsak-is in the rootk’wen(Benveniste 1973). This termshould have direct relations toweik-, which provides evidence of the earlier pres-ence of the shaman in PPIE cultures that later survived in words such as witch,wizard, and sacrificial victim. I propose that we may ultimately deconstruct thisrootweikinto two lexemes,weiandka, revealing root meanings of “vital force”and “to like and desire,” respectively. An examination of the meanings associatedwithweikin relationship to the tripartite division of I-E society illustrates thatshamanism constitutes a fundamental source of I-E religious and social represen-tations. The direct relations of I-E witchcraft to shamanism (Harner 1973b;Winkelman 1992) illustrated the evidence for the social transformation of theshamanic roots into what became conceptualized as witchcraft.THE ANCIENT PRESENCE OF SHAMANISM INPRE-PROTO INDO-EUROPEAN SOCIETIESEven more ancient PPIE origins of shamanism are manifested in the cave artassociated with the ancient origins of modern human culture in Europe. Humanculture manifested a revolutionary explosion some 40,000 years ago in theMiddle/Upper Paleolithic transition. Significant evidence of this explosionincludes dramatic art preserved in the recesses of caves. An increasing numberof scholars agree that at least some aspects of the Upper Paleolithic cave art andartifacts reflect shamanistic rituals and experiences (see Aldhouse-Green andAldhouse-Green 2005; Clottes and Lewis-Williams 1998; Dowson and Porr1999; Hayden 2003; Lewis-Williams 2002; Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005; Ryan1999; Whitley 2009; Winkelman 2002a; Winkelman and Baker 2008).The Shamanic Paradigm in Cave ArtThe shamanic context of the cave art associated with this transition is attested to ina number of key features. The shamanic paradigm provides a parsimoniousexplanation of what are the central features of Upper Paleolithic parietal art.Among the prominent nonsymbolic representations are those resembling entopticphenomena associated with autogenous images occurring during altered states ofconsciousness (ASC). Although there certainly are depictions other than thoserelated to ASC, there are numerous features that do reflect the encounter with ASC.These caves with paintings sites had numerous shamanic aspects in theirfeatures (e.g, see Clottes and Lewis-Williams for pictures). Winkelman (2002a)discusses prominent shamanic features of these images as representing differentaspects of shamanic practice, including soul flight, visionary experiences, death/dream states, human-animal identities, and animal powers. Significant human74SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"depictions include “bird-men,” symbolizing the features of the shaman’s soulflight. The “wounded man” themes may represent the shamanic death andrebirth. Cave sites themselves have a variety of shamanic functions in alteringconsciousness in their darkness and isolation, as well as in physically representingthe lower world. The harrowing and difficultexperiences of entering the cavesand passageways, combined with the remote location of representations in someof the most inaccessible areas of the caves, suggest their relationships to shamanicexperiences. Some sites have evidence of percussion instruments and bird boneflutes, and areas with primarily heel marks (as opposed to full foot imprints),suggesting ritual dances.Humans are rarely depicted, but are prominently represented as combininghuman and animal features (see cover art), often the human torso with an animalhead. These composite creatures have been called “anthropozoomorphs, therian-thropes, or sorcerers” (Clottes and Lewis-Williams, 46). The most impressivehuman representations include the famed Sorcerer of Les Trois-Fre ́res and simi-lar figures combining human and animal elements, and often placed in a signifi-cant position. This combination of human and animal features has no convincingexplanation apart from shamanism, where it reflects the shaman’s role as masterof the animals, with both animal spirit allies and the belief in the shamans’ abilityto transform into an animal. While many animal representations are naturalisticand food-related, few animals (less than 10%) appear to have been wounded orkilled, and the animals represented were generally not “economic” or frequentlyeaten (Clottes and Lewis-Williams). Amongthe numerous representations ofanimals are “rare and dangerous animals” (Clottes and Lewis-Williams, 43),which were typically relegated to the depths of the caves. These were not the vic-tim of a “hunting magic ritual,” but more likely the animal spirit ally or guardianspirit typical of shamanism.The shamanic interpretation of rock art remains controversial for some.These diverse depictions certainly had roles and meanings other than thosedirectly related to shamanism. The shamanic paradigm, however, provides themost effective paradigm for explaining these central aspects of some of these rep-resentations. The certainty that shamanic practices were central to the evolvedcharacteristics of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic representations is supported bythree lines of evidence (Winkelman 2002a, 2009; also see Chapter 6 here):1. the biologically based alterations of consciousness that produce shamanicexperiences;2. the continuity of shamanic ritual with the group ritual dynamics of homi-nids; and3. the evidence of group rituals occurring earlier than the Upper/Middle Paleo-lithic transition.The centrality of shamanic depictions to Middle/Upper Paleolithic representa-tions implies that they were already well-established aspects of human social life.The shamanic paradigm helpslink together and explain disparate aspectsof the cave art representations. For example, the “wounded man” motif with aTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM75"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"penile erection is one aspect that is difficult to explain without reference to theclassic shamanic “death and rebirth” and penile erections associated with dream-ing. The cave journeys, depictions, and artifacts exemplify shamanic practices,images, powers, and concepts. These symbolize the mythological levels of con-sciousness, the transformation of consciousness, and the expansion of identityassociated with shamanism. The central role of shamanic practice in Early UpperPaleolithic cave art and activities indicates that it was a well-established and cen-tral part of these cultures and a central feature in producing this cultural emer-gence. The activities of shamanism were central to cave art because they werecentral to the cultural activities that led to the production of art—representationsin images. The shaman’s visionary journey involved a special and intense kind ofimaging (cf., Noll 1985); that imaging manifested in cave art production wascentral to the cognitive advances associated with the Middle/Upper Paleolithictransition.So why did shamanism and these dramatic new cognitive capacities for rep-resentation co-occur at this crucial juncture of the evolution of modern humancognition? This conjuncture can be understood in causal terms and in relationto how shamanic activities and experiences enabled the operation of new formsof social organization and cognition. Shamanism was uniquely situated toaddress the needs of the Upper Paleolithic transition and is more parsimoniousthan competing hypotheses regarding modern cultural evolution.The Origins of Modern Human CognitionMithen (1996) suggested that the phenomena of the Middle/Upper Paleolithictransition involve the capabilities for combining these specialized intelligences,a key feature of the modern mind and its cognitive fluidity. Between 30,000 and60,000 years before the present (YBP) a new mentality that was manifested incave art was also used to produce many kinds of figures, jewelry, and the dramaticevolution of material culture. The causes of this enhanced cognitive functioningare problematic because this modern cultural evolution of the Middle/UpperPaleolithic is not associated with changes in brain size. This cross-modular inte-gration of different specialized modules to produce complex behaviors is rela-tively recent (40,000 to 50,000 YBP),long after the emergence of anatomicallymodern humans. The cultural explosion circa 40,000 YBP involved integratedfunctioning of different mental modules, cognitive fluidity for integrating techni-cal intelligence and social intelligence in the production of artifacts that weredesigned to send social messages regarding status, group affiliation, and relation-ships through personal decoration and adornment.ArchaicHomo sapiens sapiensand Neanderthals had similar specialized skillsfor tool use, animal exploitation, and social behavior, but these modules were notcapable of integrated functioning to produce more complex behaviors such as art(Mithen 1996). A key feature of the modern mind such as production of art inte-grates a high degree of technical expertise with a highly developed and intricateknowledge of the natural world, specifically animal anatomies. Mithen pointed76SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"out that visual symbols have specific properties (e.g., execution of preconceivedmental template, intentional communication, and meaning attribution) thatwere present in even earlier humans; however, the earlier humans did not pro-duce art with these capabilities because these distinctive cognitive domains werenot integrated. Early humans manifested cognitive abilities to create precon-ceived mental images in their working of stone artifacts; they had a social intelli-gence that depended on use and interpretation of intentional communication;and they had a capacity for attributing meaning to “inanimate objects or marksdisplaced from their reference” (Mithen, 161), as manifested in their use of natu-ral history intelligence to find animals. The interpretation of animal marks as abasis for inference about behavior indicated the presence of cognitive processessimilar to those by which modern humans interpret meaning from otherhumans’ signals or marks. However, early humans did not use this capabilityfor the same kinds of symbolic processes involved in the art of modern humans.Mithen proposed that these integrative processes of the modern human mindderived from the impacts of language on consciousness. This involved a transfor-mation of thesociallanguage of early humans as nonsocial language use began toinfiltrate social discourse. This transference of the original social function of lan-guage reflects processes of metaphorical extension of the social world to discourseabout physical objects. Integration of nonsocial information into social intelligenceprovided selective advantages (e.g., in enhanced tool making, hunting, mate com-petition) and led to a rapid evolution from a specialized social language to ageneral-purpose language capable of integrating different cognitive modules.Mithen proposed that these language-based multiple representations ofknowledge from distinct areas of the brain produced the cognitive fluidity such asexpressed in art. But the artistic depictions at the core of this cultural emergenceare not dependent spoken language (see Humphrey 1998). Rather, art involvesan imagetic, presentational, analogical modality that necessarily predated spokenlanguage. Thus, language, spoken or otherwise, cannot explain the evolution ofartistic representations. Mithen also pointed out that in the period from 60,000to 100,000 years ago,Homo sapiens sapiensshowed significant departures fromthe early traditions of ancientHomo sapiensand Neanderthals in practices suchas burying the dead; making grave offerings, which included animal parts; andutilizing tools made from materials besides wood and stone. Mithen’s proposedextension of the social language module to other domains of intelligence is inad-equate to explain the emergence of art and religious behavior tens of thousandsof years prior to the hypothesized language-induced cultural explosion around40,000 YBP. These capacities, which began around 100,000 YBP, involved a cog-nitive fluidity in which knowledge produced by the different modules was inte-grated in forms of metarepresentation, which depend on imagery and mimesis.The production of early art images combining animal and human referencesreflected a capability to integrate the social intelligence and the natural historyintelligence with personal and social identity. These cross-modular integrationsproduced basic aspects of religious thought, referred to as animistic thinking.Anthropomorphism—applying human mental and social characteristics to thenatural world—is pervasive in hunter-gatherer thought, with the natural and socialTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM77"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"world constituting a single integrated environment in which spirits imbue not onlyhuman actors, but also the animal and plant actors. The reversal of this attributionis found in the “guardian spirit” complex, in which the natural history domain isapplied to the interpretation of self, others, and the mental domains. The meta-phoric relationship between the social and the natural biology domains is alsofound in totemism. A prominent form of totemism is where human members andtheir groups are attributed characteristics derived from the natural world, whereanimal species represent social groups such as clans (see Levi-Strauss 1962, 1967).Totemic thinking involves conceptualizing human intergroup differences andrelations in terms of the models provided by the natural world—as species differ,so do humans.Mithen pointed out that the capacity to cross domains, to develop conceptsabout concepts, is the normal condition of human thought. Normal humanthought involves various forms of synthesis, in which natural and social do-mains, the physical environment and social acts, and virtually every aspect ofbehavior involve the integrated use of modules across diverse domains of reason-ing. Hunter-gatherers think of the world in a highly integrated fashion, an inter-penetration of natural and social world modules in a metaphysic of a singleenvironment that encompasses humans, animals, plants, and material in a livingnature. Typical of hunter-gatherers is the application of modules across domains,exemplified in the interactions of mental and social modules with those foranimal behavior.These integrations of personal identity, social mind-reading, and naturalspecies models produce forms of analogical thinking, metarepresentationalprocesses of integrating knowledge between and across different domains. Theanalogical ability to map across domains is a fundamental feature of human sym-bolic capacities (see Hunt 1995a). It does so either by introducing new knowledgeinto domains or by providing new ways of processing existing knowledge of aspecific domain, integrating it in different cognitive domains. These processesof the modules working together involves a representational redescription, whichprovides multiple representations of knowledge that make it applicable beyondthe module-specific goals for which it is normally used and capable of formingrepresentations of concepts and beliefs that the modules cannot form on theirown (Mithen, 58, 188).The earlier presence of these capabilities in art and other cross-modularintegrations characteristic of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition indicatesthe influences of shamanism. Shamanism emerged from the integrative capacitiesproduced by ritual practices in which the IMC integrated the functions of differ-ent modules. The shaman is also reputed to have excellent skills in several innatemodule domains: in language, being the holder of the first or ancient sacred lan-guages; in natural history, being the master of the animals and often guiding hunt-ing; and in social intelligence, being the leader of the group. Chapters 3 and 4demonstrate that shamanism contributed to this integrative cognition throughthe physiological, psychophysiological, psychosocial, and symbolic effects on con-sciousness that produce integrative brain states. Shamanic practices enhancedintegration of the different cognitive modules because shamanism stimulated78SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"activation of the intrinsic properties of the biologically based integrative mode ofconsciousness. These responses produced interhemispheric integration; frontal-limbic integration; brain stem-limbic-frontal integration; and integration acrossthe neuraxis. Shamanic alterations of consciousness provided numerous adaptiveconsequences, including enhancement of representation, information integration,stress reduction, and healing (see Chapter 5). Shamanic practices were the out-comes of developments based on a capacity for enactment—mimesis—thatemerged about a million years ago. Integrative brain conditions produced by thehominin “mimetic controller” (Donald 1991) contributed to shamanic alterationsof consciousness and provided mechanisms for cognitive expression and socialintegration.Mimesis and the Expansion of the Ritual CapacityDonald (1991) argued that the basic similarities in the Acheulean tool traditionindicated that more than a million years agoHomo erectushadachievedanewlevel of cognitive development that he termed “mimetic consciousness.” “Mim-etic skill or mimesis rests on the ability to produce conscious, self-initiated, rep-resentational acts that are intentional but not linguistic” (Donald, 168).Mimesis represents the structure of events through their intentional reenactmentand imitation, allowing for a sharing of knowledge and experience. Mimesis is anexaptation, an extension of the capacity to intentionally communicate throughdeliberate use of the information provided by behavior.Donald suggested that mimesis led to the emergence of a new level of culturethat provided the basis for a communal ritual capacity inHomo erectusthatsuperseded the ritual capacities of other animals. This new level of religiosityinvolving symbolic communication through ritual behavior must be seen as anecessary precursor to the shamanic aspects that emerged in the Middle/UpperPaleolithic cultural explosion. This development of a ritual expressive capacityprovides an earlier mechanism for cultural and religious evolution than Mithen’sproposal of language-driven development of symbolic culture.This mimetic ability is at the center of the emergence of a symbolic capacity thatrepresents with actions, using the body and its behaviors to represent perceptions ofevents. Mimesis operates on the principle of metaphorical similarity based on per-ceptual resemblance, providing a representation of the relationship between the selfand the external world through movement. It is epitomized in dance. Mimesis andits expansion in dancing and other expressive modalities (i.e., song) became impor-tant ways of communicating ideas and emotions before the emergence of spokenlanguage. Donald proposed that the first human mimetic activities were ritualdances performed with vocalizations to imitate the sounds of animals. Donald sug-gested that a new capacity to focus our attention on our own body movements pro-duced a form of body-based awareness, a physical self-consciousness that enhancedour awareness of self-in-environment. This made possible expressions based on imi-tation, and provided the foundation for culture, customs, rituals, gestures, andskilled behaviors. These mimetic traditions provided a collective expressive systemthat produced a shared group consciousness and culture.THE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM79"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Mimesis is fundamental to shamanic thought and practice. Universal emo-tional mimetic expressions include “stroking, embracing, cuddling, and handtouching” (Donald, 188), actions which have their origins in grooming behav-iors that were incorporated into shamanism (i.e., massage). The shamanic coreof drumming and dancing involves mimesis, supramodal capabilities represent-ing the integration of vocal, visual, and motor components. Mimetic expressionsof emotions are key aspects of shamanic rituals and central tools in the shaman’shealing processes, often elaborated through chanting and singing. These collec-tive social activities created culture in the common cognitive models enacted inthe public rituals that were shared by the actors and the audience alike. Theseconstitute a basic form of symbolic expression that provided cognitive impulsesfor human cognitive evolution.Mimesis expanded the capacities forculture, consciousness, and ritual.Mimesis made it possible to symbolize through the use of the body, producingmetaphors through behaviors such as mime, imitation, and gesture. Mimesismade it possible to increase group coordination because it built upon one ofthe most basic types of animal ritual behavior—isopraxis—in which animalsautomatically imitate each other’s behavior as a means of identifying other mem-bers of one’s own species. Mimesis led to more elaborate ways for individuals torecognize the other members of their group through the cultural overlays onthese basic body movement patterns. Mimesis allowed for use of the body as ageneral expressive medium for communicating to others information about ourinner states, past experiences, and future plans. These bodily movements, ges-tures, and facial expressions involvesymbolic communication in the vocalexpressive modalities of rhythmic sound and melody, both of which enhancesocial bonding and the communication of fundamental emotions (Molino2000). Emotional expression is a part of mimetic social adaptation that combinesvocal and facial expression. The use of controlled expression of emotions was apart of early human evolution of social and communication skills that enabledshamanic ritual practices to provide a number of adaptive advantages in address-ing the needs of psychologically and socially more complex humans. Some of themost fundamental features of this activity involved imitation of animals andextending animal concepts into the social domain in a practice known as totem-ism. This engagement with animals reflects adaptations that were precursors forshamanic activities.Hunting in Human Evolution and ShamanismThe power related to animals is a central feature of the roots of shamanism; theshaman was the master of the animals, believed to be capable of controlling themas assistants and transforming into them in order to use their powers. A signifi-cant feature of human evolution involves enhanced skills for hunting, for usingculture to change from being prey into being a hunter of other animals. A keyelement of hunting involves the adoption of the behaviors of animals, whicheventually involved imitation and disguise as animals to facilitate hunting. Theseactivities of imitating animals in order to facilitate disguise during hunting80SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"activities engages the basic faculties related to mimesis. These mimetic engage-ments with animal behaviors must havebeen prior to their incorporation ingroup ritual mimetic activities because of the ancient prehominin roots of hunt-ing found in other hominids. Hunting activities provided a basis for representa-tion through mimicry and new forms of self-identification.Hunting likely engaged and selected for the mimetic capacity in the ability toimitate animals, which would have directly enhanced hunting success through theability to engage in deception through imitation. Imitation also played a role inteaching about hunting and animal behaviors. The imitation used by early humansto facilitate hunting must have produced through association a greater sense ofidentification with the animal. This enactment of the “other as animal” was aninevitable outcome of mimetic hunting skills, and must have been a precursor forthe evolution of human ritual. It would have also established a basis for identifica-tion with the animal other as exemplified in totemism and guardian spirits.Hunting activities are also conceptualized in terms of the ability to acquirepower over animals, based in knowledge of their habits and behaviors. This poweris manifested through deception and imitation, mimicking of the vocal calls ofanimals to attract them. The emergence of this capacity for disguise and imitationin practices of hunters must be subsequent to a more basic capacity for mimesis,but constitute an extension of the same skills. It also set the stage for a key elementof shamanism, the identification with animal powers. The extensive focus on theanimal “other” in stealthy hunting must have also produced a degree of inevitableinternalization and identification with the “other.” And anyone who has killed ananimal with his or her own hands has experienced the emotionally charged iden-tification with the demise of the other in its final struggles for life.Hunting consequently also elicited and engaged the fundamental emotionsregarding fear of death. Not only did hunting produce death to prey, but manyanimals—not just predators but also game animals such as deer, caribou, boar,and buffalo—posed a serious risk of death to hunters. Hodgson and Helvenston(2006) suggested that the common practice of people imitating predatory ani-mals during rituals reflects “a compensatory strategy for gaining some ‘control’over their most feared predator by means of ritual dancing and singing that delib-erately induces a trance....This example provides clear empirical evidence forthe link between an emotional reaction toa predator and trance phenomena,both spontaneous and ritually induced” (Hodgson and Helvenston 2006, 8).They proposed that behavioral freezing and nonresponsive conditions typifiedby the human entry into trance had analogues in the freezing response exhibitedby most mammals and primates when they are in the presence of dangerouspredators. Such freezing is adaptive, as predators respond to movement.Hunting in Limbic and Emotional EvolutionHodgson and Helvenston(2006) propose that hunting directly stimulated the evolution of the limbicsystem, which is central to primate emotions, learning and memory, and theanatomical basis of the reward system related to hunting behavior in carnivores.This is elicited by a direct neural pathway linking the limbic system with theretinal-thalamic pathways, providing input for dealing with potentiallyTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM81"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"threatening environmental features. The evolution of the primate limbic systeminvolved an enhancement of the connections among the principal cortices of thebrain (limbic, frontal, and motor). These enhanced connections provided a basisfor greater emotional and behavioral responses, guided by an enhanced cognitivecapacity. The absolute and relative sizes of the limbic system and some of its crucialcomponents (hippocampus, amygdala) are much larger in humans than greatapes, having increased substantially across human evolution. The temporal lobesare similarly larger in humans. Hodgson and Helvenston suggested that huntingplayed a key role in enhancing the importance of these emotional centers of thebrain and experiences. Hunting evokes a variety of emotional effects, not onlyfear, dread, and horror but also wonder, veneration, and anticipatory rewardsof a good meal. Hunting must be seen as a central feature enhancing conscious-ness and awareness of death, as hunting produced death in animals and exposedthe hunter to risk of the same. Ritual encounters were used to prepare huntersfor these life-threatening activities, giving them a sense of control over these ter-rifying encounters.Ritual as a Selective Environmental FeatureRosano (2007) proposed that ritualized gatherings around a fire were significantforces that exercised selective influences on human evolution. “Consciousness-altering rituals, often taking the form of shamanistic healing rituals, constitutedan important and unique aspect of the human selective environment. This envi-ronment targeted those areas of the brain involved in focused attention and work-ing memory, and, in time, facilitated the genetic mutation or mutations thatultimately fixed enhanced working memory and symbolic function in the humanpopulation” (Rosano 2007, 47). Social rituals were part of the environment actingon the human genome, exerting a “Baldwin effect” in which a genetic adaptationbecomes subject to selection in order to follow a somatic or behavioral adaptation(Rosano 2007, 47). The Baldwin effect involves mechanisms through whichan organism acquires somatic modifications that are initially induced by environ-mental conditions through learning or physiological adaptation. Although theseacquired traits do not have direct effects on the genes, they contribute to the crea-tion of selective conditions that across time genetically establish the features in thepopulation. For instance, an ability to sing might have emerged without selectivepressures for it, but once it existed in the genotype, there would be selective advan-tages that would lead to it being established as a species trait. In the cases of sha-manic precursors, the presence of collective rituals acted on individual variationin the ability to participate in ritual, exerting selective influences on our homininancestors because of the survival-enhancement value of ritual and associated abilities.Following the work of Coolidge and Wynn (2005), Rosano proposed that anenhanced working memory capacity was essential for the evolution of cognitiveinnovation and symbolism, which required an ability to simultaneously holdvarious forms of information and goals in mind. Rosano (2009) contended thatritual group behaviors constituted a critical selective force that shaped theevolution of these aspects of modern human cognition. Campfire rituals were82SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"potentially fitness-enhancing, engaging processes that depended on enhanced useof brain areas that facilitated working memory and symbolism. Generations ofhuman ancestors sat together chantingaround a fire, creating an environmentthat exerted a selective influence formore human-like brains. Ritual exertedselective influences because those human ancestors who were most capable ofritual behavior accrued fitness advantages that derived from an enhanced accessto resources, social status, and the beneficial psychophysical effects on health.Rosano proposed that ritual behavior exerted significant selective influences inenhancing hominins’ capacity for working memory capacity because “[R]itual-ized behaviour activates areas of the brain associated with working memory andinhibitory control, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex...[and] mayhave created a Baldwinian selection environment where the ontogenetic pathwayof modern humans was altered raising the probability of a genetic mutationaffecting working-memory capacity” (2009, 244).The role of ritual as a selective environmental feature derived from theunprecedented increases in levels of social complexity that Upper PaleolithicCro-Magnons experienced. This complexity demanded the creation of larger,more complex, social integrations that cross-cut traditional group boundaries.These social integrations were enhanced by social rituals, particularly ritualbehaviors that reduced innate aggression. Ritual activities have effects on brainareas responsible for controlling aggressive responses. The widespread use of rit-ual to reduce within-group conflict found across primate species indicates thatour hominin ancestors necessarily had preadaptations involving ritual to enhancesocial bonding. When social and environmental conditions produced demandsfor effectively managing larger social groups, ritual was an already-establishedmechanism for facilitating social bonding and would have been the foundationfor further selective effects. One of the significant features that made ritual effec-tive in building social relationships derives from its ability to inhibit pre-potentdefensive responses and aggressive behaviors in order to allow for social-bonding mechanisms to take effect (see Rosano 2009).Social and Psychodynamic Functionsof Shamanic RitualThe role of shamanic ritual in the evolution of human consciousness also derivesfrom adaptive effects associated with the effects of collective social rituals. Thefollowing section addresses these adaptive potentials involving totemic relations,where animal species as used as representations of social groups. These capacitiesincorporated influences of mimesis and natural history modules in producingnew levels of social adaptation by providing tools for personal and social integra-tion. Chapter 3 discusses other adaptive potentials in shamanic experiencesinvolving the integrative states of consciousness manifested in a variety of spiri-tual experiences.

These selective factors forshamanism operated much earlier as well. Hayden (2003) proposed that shaman-ism evolved because ritual played a key role in adaptations to inhospitable environ-ments over several million years. Early hominin adaptations to these hostileenvironments involved selective pressures for the ability to forge close emotionalbonds with members of other groups who could provide them with essential re-sources like food and physical protection when needed. There are significant rolesof community and intercommunity alliances in addressing resource shortages; thisenabled shamanistic rituals to contribute to human survival through intensifica-tion and enhancement of interpersonal bonding, within-group cohesion, andinterband alliances. Rituals producing altered states of consciousness strengthenedemotional bonds between individuals. The sense of unity and pan-human identitywidely associated with shared ritual ASC contributed to the development ofstrong emotional bonds between bands and formation of alliances that were vitalto survival in times of resource scarcity. These ecstatic states brought about anexpanded sense of community, enabling early humans to overcome the “natural”tendency of distinguishing their own social group from that of outsiders, andinstead experiencing deep bonds of connection with others.Adaptations to severe environments required future planning and groupcommunication for decision making and logistical organization. Whallon(1989) indicated that declines in resources produced reductions in regionalhuman populations, and smaller groups increased the need for out-group contactto maintain mating viability and to assure access to resources. This increased theneed for information regarding potential mates and resources, particularly frombeyond the local group, “from beyond the limits of direct perception” (Whallon,437). Whallon suggested that this was achieved through intergroup exchangeof information based upon ceremonies involving ritual, myth, and religion—cultural mechanisms for storage of information about adaptive responses. Sha-manic practices also utilized intuitive forms of information acquisition andprocessing that would have enhanced this process of obtaining knowledge indi-rectly (see Winkelman and Peek 2005). Furthermore, shamanic totemic practicesinvolving individual and group identities based on animal analogies would havefacilitated the process of inter- and intragroup integration, and, consequently,individual survival and adaptation.An impediment to the inclusion of an increasing number of people in a groupis the ability to participate in serial or vertical hierarchicalization of status differ-ences. Caporael (1996) proposed that the interaction between levels of identity, inessence, coordination, was an essential aspect of the evolutionary forces acting uponthe human gene pool and part of the “mind’s natural environment.” The increased84SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"importance of alliances increased social groups’ need for hierarchical and multiplelevels of nested organization. Membership in different groups creates differentsocial identities and a person characterized by multiple selves. Shamanism was thecentral mechanism by which these multiple personal and group identities weremediated and integrated, particularly through animistic and totemic practices.Shamanism was particularly important in the context of increased aggregationand interdependence during the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition. Shamanicpractices involving the participation of all band members provided the contextfor the expression and integration of multiple identities and were the preeminentsocial activity that produced this social and personal integration. Caporael pro-vided perspectives on the factors involved in social interdependence that contributeto reproduction and survival that help illustrate the social functions of shamanism.The evolution of sociability was central to human survival, maintaining an inter-dependence in which individual reproduction is enhanced. Caporael proposed anexpanded evolutionary theory based on hierarchical and multiple levels of nestedorganization in which the interaction between levels is an essential aspect of theevolutionary forces acting on the human gene pool. For humans, the relevant envi-ronmental forces are not merely physical but primarily social. The evolution ofcoordination is a central problem addressed across species through the processesof ritual, and humans are no different. Since group living was crucial in humanevolution, it led to the selection for emotional and cognitive processes that enhanceritual participation and group support and maintenance.The group ritual is part of the dynamic processes that relate humans to theirsocial environment and through which coordination is achieved. This co-ordination requires a face-to-face interdependency that is reproduced across gen-erations through collective rituals. Ethnographic research indicates that shamanicpractices are central to the coordination that occurs within band-level societies.Eliade’s (1964) characterization of the shaman emphasized that the ecstatic inter-action with the spirit world was on behalf of thecommunity. Shamanic activitiesare the most central and most important of public events, and, typically, theydemanded the participation of all members of the local community.The selective pressures creating these prominent social characteristics werederived from intense competition with conspecifics, combined with the need tocooperate. Alexander (1989, 469) suggested that the dominance of humans and“runaway social competition” emphasized collective group identity. Aspects of thesechanges are manifested in artifacts, which reveal an emblematic group membershipand an assertive expression of individual personality, individuality, or within-groupdifferentiation of roles, status, and identity. Ethnographic analogy suggests thatshamanic practices were central to the coordination that occurs within bands andmacro-band levels, producing integration through totemistic beliefs and practicesthat constituted procedures for developing shared social identities.Totemism as a Shamanic AdaptationTotemism is the result of the attribution of animal characteristics to humans andtheir groups. This capacity to use animals as symbol systems reflects the use of ourTHE NATURE AND BASIS OF SHAMANISM85"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"“intuitive biology” module, a specialized capacity for organizing knowledge aboutanimals and animal behavior. This innate capacity is manifested in young children,who illustrate an inborn capability to understand the fundamental differencesbetween animate and inanimate objects and to recognize types or “species essence”that cannot be accounted for on the basis of their experiences. Mithen (1996, 53)proposed that this ability is manifested cross-culturally in classification schematafor the natural world and derived from a content-rich mental module for “intuitivebiology” acquired through selective pressures on prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Thisintuitive biology, or natural history module, provided the basis for a compulsivetendency to learn about animals and their behavior, an important adaptive capabil-ity in marginal environments. This ability to organize information about animalsreflects an adaptation that provided the basis for a universal analogical system forcreation and extension of meaning through metaphor.One of the most prevalent aspects of totemic thought is found in shamanisticactivities, in which the shaman incorporates animal spirits and their abilities.Typically, the totem is an animal that has a personal spiritual relationship to anindividual or a collective relationship to the group. Levi-Strauss (1962) illustratedthat totemism constituted a system for differentiating societies by means of anal-ogy. Totemic thought involves processes by which a homology is postulatedbetween the differential features existing among species and the differencesamong human groups; as animal species differ, so do human groups. Differencesamong human groups are represented through the innately recognized differ-ences among species of animals, facilitating individual and group recognition ofcorporate membership. This use of the animal world, which constitutes one of themost fundamental aspects of analogical thought in shamanism, provides a naturaltool for organizing relations within and between societies. This “cognitive inven-tion” of shamanism was a natural product of the integration of the different innatehuman capacities and provided significant adaptive advantages.The Sociophysiology of Group RitualThe functions of shamanic practices in enhancing social cohesion are mediated bypsychosociophysiological mechanisms; several of these have effects on individualand social consciousness. Shamanistic ritual alterations of consciousness aremanifestations of a “structural drive toward differentiation and reorganization ofneural systems mediating consciousness” (Laughlin et al. 1986, 120). Shamanisticpractices use ritual to elicit and shape this drive, evoking cognitive and emotionalresponses that cause physiological changes. The relationship of the dramaticsocial activities of ritual to the neuropsychology of the participants involves whatLaughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) characterized as a “theater of the mind,”procedures in which the experience of the participants is manipulated by culturaland natural symbols.These ritual interactions also provide social relations that induce the releaseof endogenous opiates (see Frecska and Kulcsar [1989]). Frecska and Kulcsar sug-gested that shamanism socially and ritually manipulated opioid mechanisms as ameans of influencing core biological functions and producing psychobiological86SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"synchrony among group members. The brain areas (orbital frontal cortex, thetemporal lobe, and the amygdala) involved in affiliative interactions, social bond-ing, multimodal sensory information processing, and selective attention andtop-down physiological regulation are also the areas with the highest density ofopioid receptors. Frecska and Kulcsar reviewed research that illustrated that brainopioid systems provide neurochemical mediation of social bonding. They sug-gested that these socially and ritually manipulated opioid mechanisms constitutea means of coordinating core biological functions. The cultural symbols cross-conditioned with these ritual activities and their physiological, emotional, andcognitive responses also acquire the ability to elicit the endocrine and immuno-logical system (see Chapter 5).A variety of shamanic activities elicit endogenous opioid mechanisms(see Chapter 4), including social bonding, prolonged rhythmic and high-intensityexhaustive exercise, nighttime activities, the stressful procedures used to inducevisions, and the elicitation of hope and positive expectations. The central role ofcommunity relations in shamanistic healing reflects their role in evocation ofendogenous opioid mechanisms and, consequently, psychoneuroimmunologicalresponses and synchronization of individuals within a group. Shamanistic healingrituals enhance social attachments through symbolically elicited physiologicalresponses. The psychosocial manipulations of these personal and social relationsin small close-knit societies induce a synchrony among individuals at psychobio-logical levels, enhancing group commitment and bonding among members. A sig-nificant feature of opioid elicitation is enhanced attachment to others and theconsequent internalization of those others as significant relations for modeling self.Ritual and Self ManagementCaporael pointed out that theselfis an identity defined in relationship to sharedgroup membership. The self is constructed—and split—in a nested hierarchicalorganization and overlapping and contextually defined in-group/out-grouprelations. The shifting membership in different groups creates different socialidentities. The evolutionary context of human relations selects for cognitive ori-entations towards the social matrix, which, because of its flexible boundaries andvariations in composition, produces shifts in personal and social identity. Thiscreates a person characterized by multiple social selves. Caporael, however, didnot explicate the mechanisms by which these multiple personal identities andmultiple group identities are mediated and integrated.Clearly, the practices of shamanism, which provide the context for the expres-sion of multiple identities, were the preeminent social activities that provided thebasis for this personal and social integration.These integrative processes weredescribed by Van Gennep (1909, 1960) as the ritual passages of separation, trans-formation, and incorporation. Ritually induced states of consciousness contrastwith the normally static and stable social life by providing a period of fluidity fortransformation of social status and self-experience through liminal or transitionalstates. The ritual then resolves status ambiguity by marking the social transitionand by producing feelings of unity and community.

Dramatic enactments of theserelations in shamanic rituals produces a conditioning of physiological responseswith cultural symbols, and associate the participant’s identity and social self withthe ritual elements representing cosmology and society. Participation in ritualdrama evokes and programs experiences, activating developmental sequences forthe individual (see Laughlin et al. 1992 and Chapter 5 in this volume).A natural result of the evolution of the human brain is the fragmentation ofconsciousness (Laughlin et al. 1992), reflecting both the increasing modularity ofconsciousness and the diversification of self into more statuses. Shamanistictraditions institutionalized procedures to overcome this fragmentation of con-sciousness by synchronizing this divergent human cognition through traditionsusing ritual to elicit the operations of innate modules and induce integrativebrain processes. The cross-modal integration of innate modules for knowledgeabout mind, social relations, and the animal world constituted a basis for meta-phoric predications about the nature of self and others, manifested in animism,animal spirits, totemism, the guardian spirit complex, and the soul journey.Shamanic ritual engaged these transformative processes through entrainingneurocognitive structures, provoking a restructuring of the self at levels below con-ceptual and operational thought. Laughlin et al. (1992) suggested that shamanichealing practices involve two basic principles: (1) a holistic imperative, a drivetoward more integrated levels of consciousness; and (2) shamanic projection, a pos-itive projection of a more advanced state of development into another person, basedon the unconscious transference of control of the individual’s intentional processesto a powerful individual or “master.” This shamanic projection underlies thepatient’s transference during therapeutic processes. The neurophenomenologicalperspective of Laughlin et al. (1992) showed that the shaman’s practices representedan evolution through the “holistic imperative,” a drive toward wholeness, or moreintegrated levels of self, society and consciousness.CONCLUSIONS: SHAMANISM ANDNEUROGNOSTIC POTENTIALSShamanism was manifested in remarkably similar ways in hunter-gatherer societiesworldwide. These cross-cultural regularities reveal the shamanic paradigm, an eth-nological analogy for reconstruction and interpretation of prehistorical culturalprocesses and a universal primordial religion. Shamanism reflects the product ofancient social adaptations that preceded culturally modern humans and contrib-uted to key aspects of that evolution by providing a variety of forms of social,psychological, psychophysiological, and cognitive integration, based on the utiliza-tion of diverse physiological and metaphoric processes. These ancient biologicalfoundations are manifested in the shamanic religious roots of cultures around theworld and in the ancient evidence of shamanism at the origins of modern humanculture.

Linguistic and cross-disciplinary perspectives illustrate that con-sciousness is fundamentally concerned with “knowing systems.” Consciousnessemerges from interactions among the biological and cultural systems that enableour construction of experience, providing a variety of structural elements fromwhich diverse forms of consciousness are produced. The fundamental elementsof consciousness involve images as representations of the body, internal states,intentions, self and others. Body-based representations are directly related tothe shamanistic out-of-body experiences. Also foundational to consciousnessare concepts of self and others, concerns central to guardian spirit relations andpossession experiences. Perceptions of others and their views are keys to self-awareness and personal identity and the roles of the spirit world in shamanism.Shamanic thought involves the production of analogical and metaphoric systemsin representations derived from innate structures. The visionary experiencesinvolve presentational symbols of the self, others, and psychological and cognitivestructures based on innate representational structures derived from the body.These personal properties provide the basis of animism and anthropomorphism,a projection of human qualities onto the unknown. These systems of meaningprovide a presentational symbolism manifested in visionary experiences and soulflight, the guardian spirit complex, and death-and-rebirth experiences. Theseforms of knowing reflect the intrinsic properties of the integrative mode ofconsciousness (IMC), psychointegrative processes that operate at the emotionallevels of basic properties of the self.

The wordconsciousness is used to refer to a wide range of conditions: of being awake andhaving awareness; feelings and thoughts; self-awareness; internal knowledgeand conviction; communal knowledge and social awareness; conscience; the abilityto know and learn; skills and capacities; and the ability to teach and share knowledgeand understanding (Winkelman 1994). The characterization of consciousness isoften considered problematic because of its diverse referents. The commonalityunderlying this diversity in denotations of consciousness is revealed by etymologicaland epistemological approaches.Etymological Roots of ConsciousnessLinguistic perspectives illustrate both the range of phenomena of consciousnessand the underlying commonalities. TheAmerican Heritage Dictionary (Morris1981)definitions ofconsciousare “not asleep; awake; awareness of one’s own exis-tence, sensations, thoughts and environment; subjectively known; capable ofcomplex response to the environment; intentionally conceived or done; anddeliberate.” The meanings ofconsciousnessare prominently based onconscious,which has a Latin origin (conscius) meaning “knowing with others, participatingin knowledge, aware of” (Morris 1981, 283; cf. Barnhart 1988). A communalityunderlying diverse usages of “consciousness” involves it constituting a “knowingsystem.” This is explicit in the etymology of consciousness found incom(with)andscire(to know, the root of the word “science”). The communal dimension ofconsciousness is also illustrated in the alternate formconscience, which refers notonly to the essence or totality of attitudes, opinions, and sensitivities held by anindividual or a group but also to the social context that creates and evaluatesknowledge. The communal dimension of consciousness as socially shared knowl-edge is also reflected in the primary definition ofconsciousin theOxford EnglishDictionary: “knowing something with others...knowing, or sharing the knowl-edge of anything, together with another” (Oxford English Dictionary1989, 756).This communal dimension frames the meanings of consciousness in the relation-ships between individual and community. The role of social factors in conscious-ness is reflective of the intensive social behavior involved in human evolution,including the ability to attribute meaning and intentionality to others, to be ableto predict their mental states and future behaviors, and to role play in order tocoordinate group behaviors, using others to model self.The meanings associated with the linguistic roots of consciousness representa range of denotations from biologically based organismic capabilities to cultur-ally derived reference, learning and experience that provide for various forms of92SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"awareness and complex intentional responses. Human consciousness involves abroad spectrum of capabilities derived from the interaction of biological capacitieswith cultural symbolic systems. Although some conceptualize consciousness asinvolving an exclusively human reflexive self-awareness, consciousness is also usedto refer to common capabilities of humans and other animals. Uses of the term“consciousness” in the cognitive, artificial intelligence, philosophical, and otherscientific traditions indicate that consciousness refers to a number of interrelatedbehaviors characteristic of complex systems that respond to their environment.There are many kinds of consciousness. Consciousness also includes a range offunctions that esoteric traditions claim supersede rational and egoic forms of con-sciousness, representing what is conceptualized as forms of spirit, soul, mind, self,and transcendental human capabilities.This range of forms of consciousness is often characterized as involvingan explicit hierarchy, as illustrated in Gennaro’s (1995, 31) model. It begins withprimitive bodily and phenomenal states (bodily sensations and perceptual states)and intentional states (desires and thoughts); ascends through various forms ofself-consciousness, beginning with nonreflective self-consciousness, metapsycho-logical thought and awareness; and continues through forms of introspection(momentary-focused and deliberate). A hierarchy of forms of consciousness is alsoa central feature of meditative traditions’ views of consciousness; Wilber (1977,1980) suggested a hierarchy of different forms of the self that produce differentlevels of consciousness (see Chapter 4, this volume).Genetic Epistemology and ConsciousnessPiaget’s (1969, 1971) epistemological approach to consciousness1illustrated thatit is produced by the structures that mediate interaction between knower andknown. This focus on knowing makes it necessary to take an epistemologicalapproach (concerned with the nature of knowing) to understanding consciousness.The epistemological approach illustrates how consciousness necessarily involvesthe relations within a system. Genetic epistemology is concerned with the nature,origin, evolution, and validation of knowing, cognition, and consciousness. Piagetproposed that cognitive development and consciousness are epistemic,2basedin the relationships constructed by the knower with the known. Knowledge, cogni-tion, and consciousness are possible because of the necessary epistemic structuresthat the subject constructs. Piaget’s epistemic stages or mental constructs under-lying knowledge and consciousness proceed through fixed stages of developmentthat represent different degrees of equilibration—adaptation of the organism tothe environment. Piaget characterized consciousness as being constructed in theinteraction between subject and object, a relationship between the knowing sub-ject and what is known through the intervening cognitive (epistemic) structuresthat contribute to the nature of what is known. Consciousness requires a concep-tualization or representation and is always mediated by a structure of interrelatedconcepts operating on a higher level than the experience.Consciousness and its development are based in a number of processes thatmediate the organism’s relationship to the environment. These include biologicalCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES93"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"structures, whose development depends on learning opportunities necessary tohandle forms and combinations of information. The social dimension and actionon the environment provide essential input into the developmental process, con-stituting the context within which a frustration of desires motivates the construc-tion of more encompassing models. Piaget characterized cognitive developmentas involving a shift from judgments based on appearances, naive perception,and empiricism to a critical rationalism: from the external objects to the internalmental mechanisms and the cognitive unconscious, a shift from the level ofaction to the level of thought. This development enables the thinker to transcendstrictly biological processes through the structures and the norms of the psycho-logical and social levels.Central to Piaget’s perspective is the role of reflective abstraction,3involvingprocesses of operation on and differentiation from the preceding level, providingfor the emergence of a higher order stage that is more complex and unified thanthe previous. The emergence of the higher level is mediated by symbolic structuresthat transform the mode or level of consciousness into a higher level. The sense ofself plays a central role in this process, identifying with that new emergent form ofconsciousness, along with a disidentification with the previous structure. This dis-identification permits transcendence of the structure and the ability to operate on itwith the newly emergent self-structure.Genetic epistemology can be extended to an analysis of meditative conscious-ness. Hunt (1995a) provided perspectives for assessing these conditions of con-sciousness as involving complex visual-kinesthetic synesthesias—multimodalintegration of information—and development in an affective line of reasoning.Contemplative consciousness can be interpreted as superseding the naive, habitual,epistemic assumptions made about the nature of knowing and the relationshipbetween knower and known, modifying epistemic constructs utilized at earlierlevels through recognition of the role of habitualized symbols mediating all ofconsciousness—perception, cognition, affect, behavior, and sense of self.Consciousness as a SystemThe production of forms of consciousness and experience through the inter-action of the brain with the environment and socially constructed interpretationsrequires a systems approach to articulate theirinterrelations. Consciousnessoperates as the organism’scognized environmentin adaptation to the operationalenvironment and to changing situations. Consequently, it involves many differ-ent internal processes that provide environmental input and interpretations to asystem that uses them to prioritize goal-directed behavior in relation to varyingenvironmental conditions and internal needs.A systems perspective is inherent to diverse models of consciousness. In the“Three Worlds” view of Popper and Eccles (1977), consciousness functions toconnect the individual organism, its social group, and the environment. Theypropose that understanding consciousness requires linking the “worlds” of physi-cal things, subjective experiences, and culture and products of the mind. Ellis(1986, 1995) characterized consciousness in terms of interacting components of94SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"a system and interactions among many factors, internal and external (context); andtheir interrelations with lower order processes, including imagination, memory,representation, emotions, and desires. Ellis (1995, 3) suggested that consciousprocesses are characterized by emotional intensity and imaginative acts in whichmemory and desire play a fundamental role in eliciting arousal and attentionalmechanisms. Motivational processes based on judgments about what is impor-tant for the organism are crucial to the selection of perceptual elements for con-scious attention. Conscious information processing uses a concept or an image ofwhat might be, with imaginative production preceding perceptual consciousness.What determines the direction of attention—and consequently, consciousness—is meaning, rather than sensory input; a predisposition to see occurs prior toperception.The cornerstone of consciousness is the ability to represent, conceptualize,and manipulate subjunctives—to imagine physical and conceptual objects. Self-consciousness derives from the representational processes that provide informationto the organism about desires through sensations, images, memories, and theirassociations (Ellis 1995). The generalized or generic image and the formulation ofmental images involve somatic images of what it is like to move one’s own bodyto meet a desire. Representation involves looking for what is important to theorganism and depends on the motivation to be aware of something, a generaldesire to know (Ellis 1995, 28, 128, 138).Body and Emotions in ConsciousnessThe body and emotions are central to Damasio’s (1999) perspectives on the originsof consciousness. Damasio views consciousness as deriving from an image—notnecessarily a visual image, but a mental pattern and representation provided inany sensory modality; consciousness derives from the sense of being the owner ofthat image, someone who experiences it. This consciousness derives from changesin the relationship of the organism to the object of perception. The adjustment ofthe body to signals from an object produces some change in the organism that isnecessary for perception; awareness of that change is consciousness.Damasio contends that while consciousness, wakefulness, and attention canbe separated, consciousness and emotions cannot. The foundations of conscious-ness are in emotions, feelings of emotions, and knowing that we have feelings ofan emotion, which constitute an information hierarchy mediated by differentforms of the self. Feelings are the experiences of emotions: “the process of feelingbegins to alert the organism to the problem that emotion has begun to solve. Thesimple process of feeling begins to give the organism incentive to heed the resultsof emoting....‘[F]eeling’ feelings extends the reach of emotions by facilitatingthe planning of novel and customized forms of adaptive response” (284, 285).Consciousness is the function of an organism that results from the ability ofthe organism to represent it own experiences. The brain’s ability to plot the organ-ism’s relationship with an object provides a “feeling of a feeling.” Some sense ofa self is necessary for having a feeling of emotions; something must have thosefeelings. It is feelings that are the primitives of consciousness, an emotion that isCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES95"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"perceived and represented as an object and is represented in a mental image as achange in the self.These second-order representations that provide the basis for consciousnessare associated with the ancient brain structures designed to regulate basic lifeprocesses. Consciousness derives from these same structures, extending the func-tions of homeostasis. Consciousness permits organisms to know their own emo-tions, extending their capacity to maintain homeostasis and adapt to theenvironment. Emotions, the feelings they engender, and consciousness are all basedin body relatedness, on representations of the organism. Emotions are a crucialinput to reasoning related to survival, innate brain devices that play a homeostaticregulatory role through nonconscious processes. Emotions have the role of pro-ducing specific reactions to situations that require specific types of responses thatpromote action from aspects of our evolved biology that help to regulate survivalbehaviors. Life-regulation processes provide the biological machinery that producestereotyped response patterns—emotions—that are manifested in images experi-enced as feelings. The brain structures most directly related to consciousness andthe ancient protoself are those that process nonverbal imagetic body signals, espe-cially the musculoskeletal structure.The Elements of ConsciousnessBaars’s (1997) global workspace theory of consciousness illustrated elements of sys-tems of consciousness in addressing the widely distributed capabilities of the brainthat are used for interpretation of, learning about, and action in the world. Thereare many kinds of contents of consciousness, including both of the external worldand internal imagery, a sense of presence, bodily sensations, personal memories,intentions, expectations, and beliefs about one’s self and the world. These are madeavailable through the functions of memory systems, behavioral automatisms, moti-vational systems, and the interpretation or meaning systems. Baars proposed thatattention engages the key elements of consciousness, which include (1) workingmemory, which provides the workspace for conscious selection among (2) compet-ing sources of information (perceptions, images, and representations) based on(3) a variety of unconscious factors affecting attention, including memory, autom-atisms (behavior), motivational systems (emotions), and interpretive/meaning sys-tems that are elicited by (4) “context operators,” particularly the “director” or selfthat selects among the options presented in the environment.Consciousness reflects systemic properties of organismic functioning involv-ing an ability to maintain adaptive interaction between internal and external envi-ronments. Consciousness begins with the need to assess and to analyze incominginformation in relation to existing conceptual frameworks. Consciousness usesthis information to formulate goal-oriented behaviors, which reflect communaldimensions—priorities defined by awareness shared with others. Consciousnessmediates the organism’s adaptation to the environment through modulation ofa range of capabilities, including attention, representation, memory, learning,desires, planning, and behavior. It couples the organism with its environmentand social group to make decisions regarding changing situations. Relating to96SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the environment in meaningfulways requires use of memory—information inreference to previous experiences and goals. Memory links sensations and percep-tions, constituting the template for recognition of sensations, based on judgmentsabout the relationship of present stimuli to past experience. A goal orientationcannot be based exclusively on reflexes; rather it requires an intelligent selectionamong behavioral options based on memory and judgment. Consciousness allo-cates attention in prioritizing biological, social, and personal goals. Goal orienta-tion requires the abilities of discrimination and judgments based on a hierarchyof needs. This experience of needs comes from our emotions, which are the foun-dation for awareness of the self.Variations in specific aspects of each of these components provide the basisfor a variety of forms, levels, and types of consciousness. Different forms of con-sciousness can be characterized in terms of the system that the subject utilizes toknow the world. These include different forms of attention (e.g., arousal, orienting,pure awareness); modes of representation (e.g., iconic, symbolic, social, language);memory (instinctual, perceptual, motor, episodic, semantic); learning (e.g., reflex,associational, conditioning, reversal); motivations/emotions (e.g., desire, question-ing, attachment, various affects); and self-reference to various others (parental,social, mythological, religious) and dimensions of the self (e.g., somatic, social,mythical).Features of Shamanic ConsciousnessThese perspectives provide the basis for characterizing shamanic consciousness interms of the information-processing systems and forms of self that the subjectutilizes. The shamanic forms of consciousness emphasize representations derivedfrom internal images and their manipulation in analogical and metaphoricalsystems. These subsystem elements help in illustrating the specific nature ofshamanic consciousness, which emphasizes1. a concern with the emotional life and the multiplicities of the self;2. experiences manifested in internal perceptual images and the body;3. activation of memories of central emotional significance to self, particularlyrepressed emotional desires, identities, and complexes; and4. evaluation and development of the self with respect to the social “others,”including those provided by animals and within mythological systems ofinterpretation;5. programming neurognostic structures of the self with spirit informationfrom mythological interpretative systems.Forms of Symbolic Consciousness: Representationaland PresentationalHuman consciousness is experienced through a number of different modalities,which are all fundamentally symbolic in nature.4Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili(1992) illustrated this in a neurophenomenological or biogenetic structuralistCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES97"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"approach to the relationships among perception, symbols, and consciousness. Thesymbolic process emerged over phylogenetic evolution as a nervous system func-tion in which neural networks are entrained by partial information. The contentof experience is a construct resulting from interaction of the nervous system withthe contents of the socialized mind operating through paradigms provided by pre-vious learning; for humans, this is largely happens through the enculturated mindand self. External perceptions and their interpretation are intrinsically symbolic,reflecting the dominance of the brain’s preeminent function, that of constructingcognized models that mediate our perception of environmental input. There is anintimate integration of the systems mediating perception and cognition in the sym-bolic processes that organize experiences perceived as the environment.Any stimulus that elicits a model, functions as a symbol by evoking associatedknowledge derived from the prior relationship between the stimuli and its associ-ated meaning. “[A] minimal symbol [is] any stimulus that provides sufficient pat-terning for entree into a model that contains more information than that providedby the stimulus” (Laughlin et al. 1992, 165). This symbolic process operates on theprinciple of topographic projection, an abstracted pattern based in reproductionwithin the cortex of a cognitive model of the spatial patterns, frequencies, andphysical relationships of the environment. The symbolic process is a fundamentalprinciple involved in the development, elaboration, and maintenance of the neuralnetworks that underlie the construction of conscious experience, including thephysical environment. This symbolic basis of consciousness is derived fromembodied images that operated prior to the emergence of spoken language. Theoriginal form of symbolic communication is manifested through visual kinestheticmirroring in mother-infant exchanges, and while later subordinated to speech,continues to develop apart from it. These perceptual presentational structures alsoconstitute the basic form for awareness within nonsymbolic organisms.Hunt (1995a&b&c) distinguished two fundamental modalities of symboliccognition involving a self-referential capacity, which he referred to as representa-tional symbolism and presentational symbolism. Hunt contrasted representa-tional and presentational symbolism in terms of the relation to conscious andunconscious processes. With representational symbolism, a highly automatizedcommunication code is employed. This is typified in ordinary language use wherethe medium of expression is so automatic that the processes are largely uncon-scious—unless struggling with a new language. Consequently, awareness of theexpressive medium is subordinated. With presentational symbolism, the expres-sion in the visual medium is focal and a polysemic meaning emerges out of theunconscious. The meaning of presentational symbolism appears to emergedirectly and spontaneously as a consequence of an experiential immersion inthe symbolic medium. This symbolism is exemplified in the expressive arts,where an open-ended meaning emerges from the forms that are sensed. Imagescan also provide knowledge beyond that embedded in propositional knowledge,particularly as illustrated in dream imagery, which has meaning beyond thatfound within waking symbolic consciousness.In contrast to linguistically based forms of representation, Hunt character-ized presentational development by building on Geschwind’s (1974) views of98SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"symbolic thought as derived from cross-modal translation, a re-representation ofknowledge. Hunt (1995a) extended Geschwind’s ideas on the basis of symbolic cog-nition in capacities for cross-modal translation across perceptual modalities, echo-ing his argument “that the potentiality for the symbolic rests in a capacity forneocortical cross-modal translations between the structures of vision, kinesthesis,and audition,...emergent out of cross-modal fusions and transformationsbetween...separate cortical ‘analyzers’ for vision, hearing, and touch-movement”(Hunt 1995c, 410, 416).The emergence of consciousness in the interaction between different systemsof representation is illustrated in Hunt’s (1995a) characterizations of conscious-ness as involving cross-modal synesthesias. Synesthesias entail subjective experi-ences of one sensory modality in terms of another sensory modality (e.g., thesound of color or somatic sensations from music). Hunt proposed that thoughtis based in emergent synesthesias resulting from the transformations across themodalities of vision, kinesthesis, and vocalization. These synesthesias providethe basis for the symbolic capacity, the mind of the organism, in the cross-modalsynthesis that results from mediation, translation, and re-representation across dif-ferent sensory modalities. Their core representations are visual images combinedwith bodily sensations.Visionary Experience as Presentational SymbolismA central aspect of shamans’ activities involves a visual experiential relationshipto a dimension of reality known as religious, spiritual, and numinous. Whetherthrust on the shaman as a consequence of illness or sought through deliberatelyinduced procedures, visionary experiences are a central tool of the shaman’sdevelopment and interaction withthe spiritual domain. The functional natureof these perceptions of the spirit world is in the internal imagetic flow that pro-vides the basis of shamanic diagnosis, journeying, healing, and other activities.Although the shaman’s intentions and cultural background play an active rolein the construction of these experiences, the cross-culturally common structuresof visionary experiences in shamanism represent fundamental aspects of humanconsciousness that reflect neurognostic structures. These visionary experiencesinvolve the engagement with neurognostic representations of the fundamentalforces of life and death, self and others, and the cosmos. These images representthe most pressing concerns for the individual relevant to self, significant others,and the emotional and social dynamics of life. These experiences may occurspontaneously, but the shaman’s training involves the deliberate cultivation ofthis internal visionary state within the context of a cultural tradition that guidestheir development. Noll (1985, 445) characterized this deliberate developmentof enhanced mental imagery as the central feature of shamanism and proposedthat at its core, shamanism was concerned with using techniques for inducing,enhancing, and interpreting visual imagery.Visionary experiences are a natural phenomenon of the central nervous sys-tem, resulting from disinhibition of the regulation of the visual cortex. This disin-hibition results in hyperactivity of the visual regions, which are experienced asCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES99"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"ongoing visual panoramas. A central part of the shaman’s cognitive potentials liesin being able to stabilize this internal world and utilize its images for a variety ofpurposes, including divination, diagnosis, healing, and psychodramatic socialmanipulation.Noll (1985) suggested that the shaman’s cultivation of visions involves twophases of training. First, the shaman learns to increase this internal imagery,enhancing its vividness through a variety of procedures. A focus on internal vis-ual imagery provides an internal experiential focus, a figure-ground cognitivereversal that enhances the primacy of the internal imagetic reality to the degreethat it provides an alternative experience to the external world. Second, the shamandevelops increased control over the internal images, known as the inner-sight orinner-vision. Shamanistic traditions exploit internal imagery as an innate humancapability that uses the mind’s capability for producing representations from itsown materials and through its own agency. This internal visionary world presentsthe spiritual beings and experiences that are found universally and must beaccepted as an experienced reality, independent of their ultimate ontological status.In shamanism, these experiences of spirits play a fundamental role in representingshamanic power and the illnesses from which the shaman’s patients suffer. Thisvisualized spirit world constitutes a symbolic system in which metaphors are usedfor representing others, self, and social and psychological processes.Hunt (1995a) characterized presentational modalities as based on symbolicarrangements of perceptual structures. The structures of this nonverbal symbolicintelligence involve inherent physiognomies and behaviors, entoptic structures(genetically based visual geometric design patterns), and microgenetic structuresof perception. Hunt (1995a, 47) called these “the maximum experiential expres-sions of a conscious awareness system” constituting a “nonverbal symbolic intelli-gence,” a language of the psyche that provides a basis for expression of a range ofmeanings. These inherent forms of perception provide a universal grammar ordeep structure analogous to that of spoken language. Hunt (1995a, 157) analyzed“white light” experiences as cross-modal synesthesias, “a cross-translation andtransformation between the modality-specific properties of the tactile-kinestheticbody image and the visual field.” Hunt suggested that the vortex tunnel and “hol-low body” experiences found in many mystical traditions “can be understood asa complex synesthesia between this ‘hollow’ tactile structure and the symmetricalfunnel or cone of the visual field itself” (158). Their widespread presence in sha-manic, mystical, near-death, and other experiences reflects their natural self-referential presentational foundation and structures of abstract intelligence in theimagetic mode.Presentational Symbolism: Imagery and ActionConsciousness depends on an organism looking for patterns in data (Ellis 1995).The focusing of attention, looking for a form, elicits an image. This imaginal con-sciousness is necessary for perceptual consciousness, which results from the matchof a mental image with a pattern of sensory input. The physical-visual field and themental-imagery field have the same experiential space and elicit the same parts of100SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"the cortex, having the same properties as an experiential space (Baars 1997). Theimage is a form of consciousness, and “[p]erception of the physical world may bethe most ancient mode of consciousness” (Baars 1997, 64). This provides a struc-ture for knowledge from iconic visuo-spatial representations of perceptual experi-ences that preserve information in an isomorphic relationship that is an analoguerepresentation of an object. The combination of activated imagery with currentsensory input, a combination of the view of the world within our embodied selves,is fundamental to consciousness.The generic image is semiotic, portraying some relationship of a concept or anobject to the percipient. Hunt integrated the works of Arnheim (1969), Johnson(1987), and Lakoff (1987) in demonstrating that images and visual spatial metaphorsprovide the basis for all symbolic cognition, using reorganized and recombinantvisual perception to present meaning. The most basic image is a proprioceptiveimage of what it is like to move one’s own body. This conceptualization of imageas behavior, a “truncated efferent response” (Ellis 1995), reflects the integration ofspatial and visual images with bodily awareness. Newton (1996) similarly con-tended that this sensorimotor basis for cognition is primarily visual, an experiencein the visual modality that includes memories and information from other senses.Conscious understandings, whether of objects, actions, or others, are all based onimagery that is derived from a reactivation of past sensorimotor experiences.This presentational modality is illustrated in what Newton referred to as thesensorimotor and image-based foundations of consciousness. Consciousness andintentionality are based in “nonintentional sensorimotor states associated with thebasic goal-directed action abilities that humans share with simpler organisms”(Newton, 3). Meaning involves being able to think of something in terms of sen-sorimotor experiences, a “knowing how to” in terms of sensorimotor experiencesand actions. Newton details cross-disciplinary support for the sensorimotortheory of cognition that indicates that all fields of knowledge, including abstractones, are based in spatial, kinetic, and kinematic terminology. The sensorimotortheory of cognition is also supported by phenomenological studies of intention-ality, which show human experience, including cognition and language, to requireembodiment. Newton (1996, 29) posited a central representational system for allmodalities of knowledge, including spoken language and abstract cognition derivedfrom the common brain mechanisms for movement that are manifested in senso-rimotor representations.The work of Werner and Kaplan (1952), McNeil (1979), Johnson (1987),and Newton (1996) illustrated that sensorimotor ideas and representations derivefrom physical experiences. The memory traces of sensory and motor experiencesprovide the basis for signs; through semiotic extension they provide the mediaused to organize all abstract thought and cognitive structures. In both abstractand concrete domains, bodily systems are the ubiquitous system of reference,reflecting the sensorimotor basis for all of cognition. Johnson examined howmetaphors describing mental states have their basis in the construction of imagesor memories of previously performed sensorimotor activity, that is, imaging andremembering how it feels to use our bodies in particular ways. The organism’saction on that environment provides a body-based template for symbolism.CONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES101"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The representation of abstract symbol structures in ways isomorphic with senso-rimotor structures is through combinatorial arrangements of sensorimotor rep-resentations (Newton, 23).Newton illustrates that self-awareness is in essence awareness of bodilyresponses to sensory input. This somatically generated input is the basis for theperception of the externality of perceptual objects. Understandings of objects arebased on how it feels to use them; Newton further illustrated that intentional men-tal states are also best understood in terms of actions. Both physical and mentalactions share a common structure of intentionality in reactivated traces of sensori-motor experience, which are the basis for planning of action and the constructionof mental representations.The work of Lakoff (1987) and Johnson (1987) illustrated that even languageis based in these experiences of embodiment. More-complex abstract forms arederived from bodily and spatial experiences represented in image schemas. Imageschemas provide the basis for all logical relationships, with perceptions providingthe template that permits the operation of propositional logic. Newton consideredthe comprehension of natural language to involve analogical representationalstructures derived from the agent’s experience of its own basic voluntary actions.Understanding linguistic material involves creation of mental image models basedin sensorimotor representations constructed through the same mechanisms thatunderlie perception and action.Newton illustrated how sensorimotor structures use analog models torepresent perceptions of self, environment, intentionality, and all higher cognitiveactivity. The use of these sensorimotor structures as a medium for representingthe conceptually more abstract relations is based on analogical reasoning. This isnecessary because central to any mental activity is the use of structures of reasoningfrom familiar domains to understanding novel domains. Cognition depends onmetaphor, beginning with others serving as the basis for representing our own self(e.g., “mirroring”) and continuing with the use of one’s own state of mind andemotions to interpret other minds. These processes are exemplified in mother-infant interactions, where one’s own body and emotion are understood throughtheir manifestation by others.Mimesis: The Body as MetaphorHunt (1995a) illustrated how the experiences of shamanic and meditative con-sciousness involve images that are physical metaphors. Analogical cognitionwithin this bodily sensorimotor foundation and expressed through the visualmodality is a core aspect of the out-of-body experience, or soul flight. Hunt char-acterized the classic phenomena of shamanism such as soul flight as using thepresentational imagetic mode. These images reflect the structures of abstractintelligence operating through a self-referential capacity, an imagetic expressionof Mead’s (1934) concept of social awareness. This awareness involves taking therole of the other towards self, imagining how others perceive our person. The socialcapacity to internalize others’ perspectives regarding one’s own self is used to per-ceive/construct an image of one’s own body as would be seen from the perspective102SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"of the other. These perspectives illustrate that shamanism and the mystical tradi-tions involve ritual and symbolic technologies for manipulation of experiences ofthe self by separating awareness from its basis in the body scheme.These perspectives reflect Piaget’s approaches to cognitive development asoccurring throughschemes, forms or structures of knowledge based on organizedpatterns of behavior. Early cognitive development is based in a sensorimotorscheme, an action scheme involving acting like what is symbolized (or acting outthe visual scanning of its form and dimensions). This stage of development, basedon the coordination of the senses with perceptual schemes, is centered in the body.This body-centeredness is superseded in the final sensorimotor stage, when thechild acquires the ability to mentally represent objects and actions not immediatelypresent. This deferred imitation is based on internal symbolic forms that are repre-sented in visual images. Piaget’s second major epistemic stage of development ofcognition and consciousness is that of preoperational thought, a semiotic functioninvolving “the ability to represent or symbolize by means of imitation, play, signs,and symbols” (Kitchener 1986, 18). This mimetic symbolic ability is primarilystored in images rather than words and with thinking expressed in motor behavior.Arnheim’s (1969)Visual Thinkingillustrated these forms of uniquely humansymbolic cognitive abilities manifested in behavior. These operate independent oflanguage skills, as evidenced in individuals with language-debilitating brainlesions or pathologies, and in children prior to language acquisition (Donald1991). This uniquely human cognitive competence is manifested independentof language in various forms: “mimetic and gestural representation, categoricalperception, various generative patterns of action, and above all the comprehensionof social relationships” (Donald, 167). Other contexts in which humans withoutlanguage manifest these advanced cognitive capabilities include games, sports, arts,crafts, emotional responses, work—and shamanistic experiences.This language-independent symbolic representation of mimesis uses bodilyactions to express intentions. It is theintentionalreenactment and imitation whichdistinguishes mimesis from the involuntary nature of mimicry. Metaphorical sim-ilarity based on perceptual resemblance represents a relationship between the selfand the external world in movement. The inherently cross-modal nature of mim-etic representation in integrating sensory and somatic modalities provided the basisfor a uniquely human prelinguistic level of symbolization. Mimesis has propertiesthat preceded speech and are necessary for it. These “include intentionality, gener-ativity, communicativity, reference, autocueing, and the ability to model an unlim-ited number of objects” (Donald, 171).Donald illustrated that use of mimesis for representational purposes consti-tutes “the core of an ancient root-culture that is distinctly human...[and] stillform[s] the expressive heart of human social interchange” (189). Mimetic skillsare represented in a wide range of performance systems, including gestures, physical(manual) signals, postures, and rhythm. Mimesis is episode-bound and concretebut provides a medium for the expression of complex social interactions. Thevisual-motor domain, including facial expressions, gestures, postures, and rhythmicmovements, provides the principal means through which mimesis expresses non-verbal and emotional communication, an ancient mimetic social adaptation.CONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES103"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Human facial emotional expressions have less of a voluntary character than othermimetic acts, often manifested unconsciously; others can “read” our feelings evenif we are trying to keep them to ourselves (e.g., crossing the arms against the chestmay convey sentiments of which we are not aware).Mime provides the basis for the acquisition of many aspects of behavior,including mannerisms, body postures, social behavior forms, communicative ges-tures, and many skills for the construction of cultural artifacts. Mimesis providesa means of modeling and rehearsing others’ social roles—in essence, expressingthe social structure, social relations, social roles, and other social activities.The mimetic skills required highly specific brain adaptations that involve afunctional system distributed across brain systems (Donald). The mimetic con-troller is not localized but depends on systemic functions with a widespread andcomplex anatomical basis because mimesis is so rarely absent in humans. Someaspects, such as emotional expression, prosody, and rhythm, are apparentlyright-hemisphere controlled, whereas others, such as visual manual skills, areapparently left-hemisphere based. Mimetic cognitive capabilities, including ges-ture, tool making, emotional expression, and social intelligence represent a pre-linguistic level of cognitive development that provided the groundwork of basicsemantic structures. Mimesis is more restricted than language and ambiguousin its representation, but nonetheless persists today as a superior form of repre-sentation of certain forms of knowledge: “modeling social roles, communicatingemotions, and transmitting rudimentary skills” (Donald 1991, 198). This mim-etic controller was the dominant representational device until the evolution oflanguage, producing “[m]ime, play, games, tool making, skilled rehearsal, andreproductive memory” (Donald 1991, 190).The generative skills and capabilities of the nonlanguage areas of the brainfor comprehension of social behavior and thought illustrate that the unique intel-lectual skills of humans are independent of language, including planning, semanticrepresentation, and most of the cognitive activities considered to be uniquelyhuman. This language independence is manifested in semantic memory, proposi-tional knowledge, planning skills, social interaction, and evaluation skills that per-sist in the absence of language. Donald proposed that mimesis provided anindependent generative system, an unbounded central system with generative capa-bilities responsible for analysis and production of discourse and narrative, forma-tion of plans and scripts, and enhancing coordination with others.SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS: OTHERSIN SELF AND MINDHuman perceptions of spirits depend on an innate intelligence involving “mindreading,” an ability to infer the mental states of others of our species. The apesmanifest their most complex behavior in the specialized social intelligence thathas been referred to as Machiavellian, reflecting the highly developed skills of manyprimates in using these skills in the cunning deception and alliances that are a104SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"pervasive aspect of their social life. This requires a developed social intelligence thatreflects adaptations to the social demands and processes that group living createsfor primates. These social processes produce a need for cognitive skills forcooperation and in-group competition, and selected for a new level of mentalprocessing that enables individuals to predict others’ behavior, providing atheory of mind or “mind reading” that can be used to intuit the mental processesof others. These predictions are models based on their own minds and motiva-tions, combined with hypothesis-building and testing. This intuitive psychologyattribution of mental states is based on the organism’s use of its own mind andits feelings and behaviors in similar contexts to provide a model of a mind ofanother and the behaviors it would likely produce. This social cognitive capabilityto predict others’ behavior entails social forethought, a prediction of futurebehaviors. Mithen argued that these social behaviors constitute the biologicalfunction of consciousness, with the evolution of reflective consciousness derivedfrom these social behaviors. The ability to read others’ minds constituted anessential basis for the maintenance of social cohesion and a foundation for a pri-mordial aspect of human consciousness, “knowing with” and knowing selfthrough others.Consciousness and self are necessarily linked; because consciousness involvesrelationships between knower and known, it requires a knower with some senseof entityhood (self-representation) and for whom priorities are weighed. Selvesoperate as subsystems that selectively modulate an organism’s behavior in rela-tionship to a changing hierarchy of environmental demands, both physical andsocial. The self capacities select among different elements in forming conscious-ness, particularly ranking priorities based on motivations, emotions, and selectivemeanings.The aspects of consciousness referred to asreflexive awarenessalso involve thissocial capacity in order to direct awareness toward one’s own ongoing subjectiveexperiences. Hunt (1995a) contended that it is the cross-flow, or cross-modaltranslation, between different modalities that provides the basis for self-referentialawareness. Self-referential functions arise from a basic self-reflexive capacity thatis based in the other, “a special consequence of our capacity to ‘take the role ofthe other’ toward ourselves as personal awareness” (Hunt 1995c, 17). This self-awareness is not only reflexive but also evaluative, derived from social engagementand using social others as a point of reference.Fundamental aspects of the nature of the self and consciousness are derivedfrom social relations and their symbolic bases. Hunt (1995a) illustrated this withMead’s (1934) perspectives on the capacity of humans to “take the role of theother,” based on internalizing and imagining the expressions of others towardself. Mead emphasized the central role of the group in self-understanding, wherethe individual depends on the incorporation/internalization of others’ perspec-tives to coordinate one’s own behavior. This is Mead’s concept of the generalizedother, involving the self’s internalization of the roles and knowledge of othersin society. The use of others/society as a model for self entails a form of meta-phoric understanding, using one frame of reference or modality (others) toCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES105"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"elucidate another area, the self. These “other” representations provide the contentfor the self and the context (others) that makes possible consciousness and thecommunicative interactions of social life. The self and ego depend on thesemodels and their conflict for personal development. These conflicts are providedby social relations, where others provide norms for self characteristics and frus-trate goals and desires. In this sense, consciousness is fundamentally dialogic,based on social concerns, a dimension of consciousness clearly indicated byits etymology.Hunt (1995a) suggested that these capacities for self- and other-referenceare based in nonverbal presentational symbolic processes. This recombinatorysymbolic capability is first manifested in facial mirroring in infancy. This biologi-cally based capacity for cross-modal translations between visual image (mother’sface) and the kinesthetically felt face of the infant is the first manifestation of sym-bolic communication, providing the basis for learning how to take the role of theother, and, consequently, to produce self-awareness. “Social mirroring—as incipi-ent ‘taking the role of the other’—and cross-modal translations—as the core ofthe symbolic capacity—are coemergent and inseparable. Human cognition is, fromthe beginning, structured in the form of dialogue” (Hunt 1995c, 88).The cross-translation between self and other found in mirroring capabilitiesis present from birth. This mother-infant exchange enables the infant to discoverits own face through the return of mirrored expressions and to take on the role ofthe other in mirroring the mother’s facial expressions. This mirroring constitutesthe first form of symbolic expression. The other as image and physical object sub-sequently emerges as the model for understanding of one’s own unseen physicalself, illustrating the social foundations essential for self-consciousness. The pro-cess of social mirroring of the other developed in mother-infant dyad plays a fun-damental role in subsequent self-development. This process is based in acommon auto-symbolic, or self-specifying, system, and is manifested in the senseof recognition of an “other,” a presence. This notion of felt presence, the sense ofself in the unknown other, is a basic manifestation of our plural symbolic capabil-ities in relation to the environment (Hunt 1995a). This sense of the “other” isderived from the use of one’s own (dis)embodied self as a model of the unknownother, providing a basis for relations with the spirit world and others.Forms of Self-Agents and ConsciousnessBaars (1997) characterized the concept ofselfas having an indispensable role inconsciousness. Consciousness is “for something,” and that is a self, the organism’sauto-representation of the organism for the organism. Roles of self in consciousexperiences include perceiver, actor, narrator, and the context for the long-termstability of identity. The self accesses the elements of the system necessary for con-sciousness, including sensory information, memory, affect and personal facts, aswell as intentions. The self guides the organism’s most basic expectations aboutthe world, a goal hierarchy to differentiate the priorities encountered.The conceptualization of consciousnessas a framework for processinginformation to guide behavior in adaptive and meaningful ways makes the106SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"interpretations used to construct meaning also central to consciousness. Theseinterpretations begin with different concepts of the self as agent and social othersas the contexts for evaluation.Proto, Core, and Extended SelfThe different forms and roles of the self can be understood in terms of a hierarchyof functional systems proposed by Damasio (1999). He proposes that the clinicalevidence and various deficits of the self indicate that we need to understand con-sciousness in terms of the different forms of the self, which he labels the protoself,core self, and extended or autobiographical self. The protoself is based in themomentary maps of neural patterns that represent the multiple conditions ofthe physical structure of an organism in that moment. Baars pointed out that asensorimotor self based on sensorimotor mapping provides a basic self/otherdifferentiation that is necessary for any kind of sensory system. Core self dependson second-order interpretations derived from experiences of the protoself. Con-sciousnesses of emotions produces core self. The core self is the ever-changing selfderived from the content of experience. The autobiographical extended self is thepermanent self derived from personal history, and depends on core consciousnessand conventional and working memory. The basic capabilities to function as asocial being are found in the core self, where behavioral habits and skills andthe ability to respond meaningfully to the environment may persist in spite ofloss of personal autobiographical identity. Extended consciousness involves anelaborated sense of self-identity that evolves across the lifetime. Although it maybe found in nonhuman animals, it is a phenomenon that reaches its pinnacle inhuman language and the synthesized memories across the person’s lifetime. It isbased on the contributions of more fundamental aspects of the self.ProtoselfDamasio describes a protoself derived from nonconscious processes thatrepresent the organism in the organism’s own brain. This protoself does not haveconsciousness, however—no perceptions, no interpretations, nor any knowledge.The protoself derives from structures involved in survival activities, homeostasis,wakefulness, attention, emotions, and learning. The protoself and its second-order maps are primarily produced by phylogenetically older structures of bodyregulation and representation found along the midline of the brain. This midlinelocation begins in the brain stem and continues upward to the cingulated andsomatosensory cortices. Damasio proposes that a central area maintaining the pro-toself is the midbrain or misencephalic reticular formation (MRF), a collection ofnuclei that regulate basic life processes, including wakefulness and sleep, giving riseto the name ascending reticular activating system. The protoself is based on func-tions managed by brain stem nuclei, including reticular, monoamine, and acetyl-choline nuclei; the hypothalamus and basal forebrain that connect the brain stemand forebrain; and the somatosensory cortices, especially in the right hemisphere.The protoself does not require, however, the early sensory cortices, cerebellum,CONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES107"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"hippocampus and hippocampal-related cortices, temporal and most frontalcortices; and prefrontal cortices.The Core SelfThe capacities of core consciousness are based in the organism’s representationsof the protoself and derived from an account produced of the protoself’s repre-sentationsofthestatesofitsinternalsystems(organs)aswellasthoseofthemusculoskeletal frame. Damasio (169–170) characterizes the production of coreconsciousness as deriving from the enhanced nonverbal image of an object thatresults when an organism produces a representation of how its own state ofaffairs has been affected by information processed regarding that object. “Thefirst basis of the consciousyouis a feeling which arise in the re-representationof thenonconscious proto-self in the process of being modifiedwithin an accountthat establishes the causeof that modification....The core self inheres in thesecond-order nonverbal account that occurs whenever an object modifies theproto-self” (172, 174). Consciousness thus has its origins in the processing ofthe sensory qualities of an object and their changing effects on the organism. Thesechanges are represented as second-order maps of the relationshipbetween theobject and perceiving organism. The enhanced image of the causative object pla-ces it in a spatial and temporal context. The mental images that describe theseorganism-object relationships and second-order maps are feelings and body-related maps. These experiences are the subject of a nonverbal account, a “wordlessnarrative” based on images providing a causal explanation of the organism-objectrelationships expressed in second-order maps. The brain’s ability to produce soma-tosensory maps of both our plans for actions and the actions in second-order mapsprovides multiple mechanisms for constructing the narratives that are at the foun-dation of our primordial consciousness. These narratives are wordless, but storiesnonetheless in the sense of a second-order mapping among related events thatexists prior to their third-order mapping into language, a nonverbal conceptionof a never-ending series of actions upon the self that may be translated into words.The core self is conscious of the here and now, an organism’s inner sensebased in images and feelings of its relationship to an object. The core self and con-sciousness of humans does not depend on humans’ higher cognitive capacities oflanguage and reason, nor does it require conventional or working memory, atten-tion, language or reason—not even the ability to remember or produce imagesand use them for problem solving. The coreself is transient and constantlyrecreated in the information provided by the protoself. The anatomical dysfunc-tions that affect core consciousness are located along the midline (central positions)of the brain, particularly the brain stem, thalamus, and hypothalamus, reflectingancient evolutionary adaptations that humans share with many other species; con-sequently, Damasio proposes that the core self is not exclusively human. Damasio(180) proposes that there are several brain structures capable of producing suchsecond-order neural patterns derived from a cross-signaling across several struc-tures, specifically: the superior colliculi in the midbrain, the cingulate cortices, thethalamus, and the prefrontal cortices. Damasio considers the cingulate cortex to108SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"provide the most integrated view of the body. Cingulate cortices combine sensoryand motor information with emotional processes, engaging processes that are par-ticularly active during dreaming. Damasio proposes that dispositions that generateimages and actions are found in these neuron ensembles in subcortical and higherorder cortices that serve as convergence zones. Core consciousness is also intimatelyrelated to emotions; without core consciousness, the person does not display emo-tional expressions. Core consciousness is an essential resource for all of thought.While not dependent on higher cognitive and consciousness processes, core con-sciousness underpins them. Core consciousness influences attention, workingmemory, learning, language, and intelligent thought.Damasio notes how the impairment of extended consciousness may produceself-dissolution, depersonalization, mystical states, and conditions such as multiplepersonality disorder. This reflects manifestations of the core self, the level of selfand consciousness engaged by the shamanistic traditions. These engagementsinvolve a variety of self-forms, including the mystical no-self, alternate forms ofsocial self acquired through possession, and the animal selves of shamanic practice.However, these experiences may also involve extended consciousness, as Damasiosuggests that it is the extended conscious that has the capacity to move forwardand backward in time, accessing anticipated futures and the relevant past.Adaptive Roles of Self in ConsciousnessActions that ensure survival depend on images that provide information aboutpossible patterns of action and the opportunity to review scenarios and optionsand choose among possible responses. Consciousness is the device or processthrough which an organism can purposefully simultaneously consider andmanipulate multiple images, assess them in terms of the organism’s interests, andselect among the possible courses of action. Consciousness derives from connectingthe images with the basic systems involved in life regulation, allowing for amanipulation of those images in relation to the options that produce outcomesthat are in the organism’s advantage. “Consciousness opens the possibility of con-structing in the mind some counterpart to the regulatory specifications hidden inthe brain core, a new way for the life urge to press its claims and for organisms toact on them” (Damasio 1999, 25). Consciousness allows for the mental concernsof the organism to act on the innate regulatory systems and their conditioning.The adaptive roles of the self in consciousness are illustrated by Waller(1996) and Scheff (1993), who suggested that consciousness has been selectedfor problem solving under novel conditions. The solution of nonroutine problemsrequires a mental capacity to manipulate one’s self in relation to the tasks of prob-lem solution. Waller concluded that the sense of self has evolved to maintain theappropriate problem-solving and task orientation. There is a fundamental and nec-essary role of self in consciousness in its contribution to a theory of mind and inexpansion of the roles of agents. Scheff emphasized at least three different formsof self-agents: (1) instinctive genetically inherited patterns, (2) learned skill sequen-ces, and (3) command-control. Whereas instinctive and learned sequences agentsbecome stereotyped and constant, command-control agents are variable in orderCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES109"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"to detect conflict and to serve as a mediator in making decisions. These three agentsprovide the basis for behavior sequences and the development of ego and self inresponse to the need for mediation of conflict between the different agents. Selfand ego mediate among the demands of different agents and resolve initial conflictsthrough serving as higher order agents within a hierarchy of goals. The ego can becharacterized as the highest level command-control agent, with control over a largenumber of lower level agents (Minsky 1985). The ego, however, is not always incontrol of what the body does, with lower level command-control agents poten-tially able to circumvent the goals of the ego. Shamanic practices manipulate lowerlevel agents through the alteration of consciousness, providing more direct accessto unconscious aspects of the self.Scheff (1993) characterized the self as a multilevel structure or process ofagents that may be expanded laterally at the same level and vertically across anumber of levels of command-control. The self’s intelligence is a direct functionof the number of levels that it controls. Although proliferation of agents increasesthe likelihood of conflict, a larger number of levels permits the more effectivemanagement of conflict. Various forms of the self provide a hierarchy of levelsof control necessary to deal with different kinds of goals and internal conflicts.The simultaneous processing by different self-agents, combined through associa-tive processes, provides a complexity of processing and the basis for intuitive sol-utions to problems. Shamanic practices exemplify processes for accessing theseintuitive solutions through a variety of practices that access the unconsciousand body-based modes of knowledge (see Winkelman and Peek 2004).Intelligent behavior depends on a combination of the serial analytical pro-cesses and the intuitive parallel ones, combining a wide range of contingent associ-ations characteristic of an open system. Humans require an open system becausehuman interaction and interrelationships are inherently ambiguous, with meaningcontextually dependent. Scheff suggested that interpretation is based on partici-pants’ ability to decode messages through using part/whole thinking. Meaning isderived by relating elements to a vast amount of knowledge and information avail-able in a variety of local contexts, including biographical knowledge, the physicalsurroundings, earlier conversations, and a semantic and cultural network of rel-evant meanings. Cultures everywhere have produced systems for such interpreta-tion in the mythological systems and spiritual beings that inhabit them. The useof the mythological and spiritual world for modeling the selfderives from ourinnate capacities and need to model the self on others. The spirit world providesabstract representations that expand the repertoire of possible self models.The Guardian Spirit QuestThe vision quest, or guardian spirit quest, whether individualistic or as a form ofshamanic training, was the most fundamental and widespread religious complexfound in Native American cultures (Benedict 1923). It had its parallels in shaman-istic practices around the world. Central to the vision quest and the guardian spiritquest were efforts that exemplify the shaman’s seeking of a relationship with thespiritual world as central to training and development. The vision quest activities110SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"were conceptualized as involving the individual development of a special relationwith the spirit world based on seeking a personal relation with spirit allies or guard-ian spirits. The guardian spirit encounter was often seen as central to the develop-ment of one’s special skills and competencies as an adult. In some cultures, it wascentral to religious activities for all men, as well as for women in some cases. A per-son’s training for the vision quest began as young as six or seven years old, wheninstruction was provided in how to attract guardian spirits and how to behave withrespect to them. The process for producing the experiences of contact with the spi-rit world involved submission to conditions requiring considerable personalendurance, sometimes withstanding extreme pain for extended periods of time.This included the use of purgatives, prolonged fasting, self-imposed isolation,exposure to temperature extremes, exercise to exhaustion, extreme physical pun-ishments like whipping and scourging the body, and other austerities, includingextensive self-inflicted wounds in some cases. If these procedures were successful,they produced experiences that were interpreted as a vision or a visitation fromthe spirit world. The spirit allies encountered in the vision experience providedpowers, strength, fortitude, or good fortune represented in an object that symbol-ized and served as a source of power.Swanson’s (1963) in-depth analysis of the psychosocial functions of theguardian spirit quest indicated that they gave many different kinds of powerand advantages—endurance and strength, luck in hunting, protection in battle,assistance in love, protection or restoration of one’s health, and the power to cureothers. The guardian spirit enabled people to do things, providing possibilitiesthat people could use or reject. Guardian spirits were viewed as distinct from theperson’s soul, spirit, and vital force. The guardian spirits did not take over the per-son, nor were they viewed as part of the individual’s own personality. Guardianspirits were the spirits of specific plants, animals, or other natural phenomena.The guardian spirits had selected the individual with whom they were associatedas a gift bestowed on the recipient.These experiences were part of the process through which a person engagedthe transition from childhood into full adulthood. Swanson suggested that theguardian spirit quest is a search for the charisma that will enable the person toperform as a competent adult. The guardian spirit complex meets the individual’sneed for empowerment and guides the individual in the personal and social choicesfrom among the options available for adult development and specialization.The guardian spirit quest serves as a means of self-assessment and examinationof the commitment to pursue a specific interest in life. This perspective illustratesthe role of spirits not as external supernatural agents, but as aspects of one’s selfand individual identity.Shamanism and the SelfShamanism developed traditions for constructing, manipulating, and using avariety of selves for psychological and social integration. The complex nature ofpersonal identity is apparent when examined within the context of shamanism,possession, and the mythological systems used to interpret human nature.CONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES111"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The numerous forms of self-reference found in mythological systems provide forpolysemic representation of the organisms’ operators, including the diverseaspects of the self. Animistic entities and processes, particularly, the shamanisticguardian spirit complex and possession, provide mechanisms and symbolic sys-tems within which the self develops in interactional symbolic relationships withothers. The most important representations in shamanistic thought are in thespirit world of “sacred others” (Pandian 1997), who operate in both the spiritualrealms and human social worlds. Pandian showed these religious phenomena toinvolve processes for identification of the cultural locus of the symbolic self (alsosee Chapter 5 here).These systems also serve other cognitive and social functions, including theresolution of contradictions between the reality of suffering and broader systemsof cultural meaning. These religious-meaning systems include models for the rep-resentation and, hence, the development of the self. The beliefs of these systemsconstitute the projective systems and norms for psychosocial relations that struc-ture individual psychodynamics and collective patterns of behavior. Pandiancharacterized the “shamanistic sacred self” as involving processes that provideprotection through a psychocultural therapeutic communication system thatproduces and maintains the symbolic self and culture. The phenomena of spiritworlds constitute models for transformative functions of the self.Death and Rebirth as Self-DevelopmentEliade (1964) pointed out that selection for the role of the shaman may bederived from a crisis, a period of illness, or insanity characterized as a spirit afflic-tion, a consequence of a divine being choosing the individual for the shamanicrole. This illness or a spirit attack leads to experiences interpreted as death.This initiation crisis typically involved (1) an experience of suffering, followedby death, dismemberment, and rebirth; (2) an ascent to the sky and descent to thelower world; and (3) conversations with spirits and souls. These entities may attackthe initiate, slashing the body or devouring it piece by piece. A recurrent motif isthe removal of the eyes and their strategic placement for the observation of the totaldismemberment and destruction of the body. The skeleton may be stripped ofall flesh and cleaned, while flesh and organs are consumed by various mythologicalparties. The body of the initiate is then remembered, or reconstructed, a processthat imbues the shaman with power and spirit allies. The initiate shaman’s develop-ment of a dialogue with spirits is a sign of the improving condition of the initiatesas they engage in and imitate conversations with the spirits, invoking them throughchanting and singing. During this period the spirits give the initiates new rules forlife that healed the individual, and in the process making him or her a shaman, a“wounded healer.”Although all of this initiatory crisis may not be a universal feature of sha-manism, some of its features such as the death-and-rebirth experience do appearto be universally associated with shamanism (Winkelman 1992). Walsh (1990)suggested that the emotional turmoil and distress associated with the shamaniccall in many cultures suggest that it may constitute a brief reactive psychosis,112SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"atypical psychosis, or schizophrenia or schizophren-form disorders. However,such interpretations require that the shaman’s condition be examined from theperspective of psychopathology rather than as a form of psychological decon-struction designed to permit the manifestation of other neurognostic symbolsand forms of self-reference.The shaman’s initiatory sickness involving personal death reflects the frag-mentation of the conscious ego. Walsh suggested that these experiences representa psychological transformation process, which tends to occur at times of over-whelming stress, resulting from the intrusion of unassimilated neural structures.The cross-culturally recurrent aspects of death, dismemberment, and rebirthrepresent deep archetypal or neurognostic processes in response to the inabilityof the psyche to maintain balance. The death-rebirth experiences reflect the deathof one identity in development of another. As a consequence of the inability ofthe existing psychological structures to manage the stress, the organization of thepsyche—identity, beliefs, habits, and conditioning—collapses, resulting in aperiod of introversion and reduction of intentionality. Laughlin, McManus, andd’Aquili (1992) suggested that this collapse of internal structures is experiencedhomeomorphogenetically as dismemberment, “autosymbolic images” of one’sown breakdown.Following the collapse of the psyche, experienced as dismemberment anddestruction, a psychological reorganization follows, guided by an archetypal drivetoward holism or holotropism. Walsh suggested that the spontaneously occur-ring threatening images symbolize the shadow, aspects of the self and the psychethat are disowned and repressed because they are considered to be bad and evil.When these structures are forcibly re-elevated into consciousness in distressingsymbolic forms, they may be perceived as threatening external entities. The spiri-tual world provides a conceptual domain for organizing the experiences of thesestructures, whose locus of intentionality is dissociated from the conscious neuralnetworks of the ego. The symbolic manipulation of these spiritual constructs andtheir relationships to the ego can produce changes in affect and other psychody-namic processes. As one becomes more accustomed to the experiences, and asthey are associated with symbols with positive affect, they lose their terrifyingnature as representatives of death and become objects of exploration. Theprogressive development of the shaman requires that the ego have sufficientstrength to reciprocally assimilate conflicting structures through transformationsthat can resolve the discrepant internal models. The shaman’s experiences arestructured by the cultural conventions and beliefs and, in some cases, by the tute-lage of more experienced practitioners.Resolution of these experiences leads the shaman to transcendence, a newlevel of identity. The universal experience of magical flight symbolizes this trans-formative experience. These are homeomorphogenetic (common form or struc-ture) transformations in structures of consciousness, a restructuring process ofthe ego produced by the symbolic models and the holistic imperatives towardpsychointegration. The death-rebirth experiences frequently result in dramaticalleviation of psychosomatic, emotional, and interpersonal problems resistantto previous psychotherapy, with reorganization guided by archetypal drivesCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES113"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"toward wholeness (holotropism) (Walsh).

Psychological disturbances are often followed byincreased mental health, a consequence of the growth experiences that they pro-voke,suchasexemplifiedinthedeath-and-rebirthmotifwhichreflectsfunda-mental processes of transformation of self.Shamanic Structures of ConsciousnessShamanic experiences of death and rebirth are not intrinsic signs of psychopa-thology but represent neurognostic structures of the collective unconscious.These shamanic structures have been examined by Grof (1992), based on his dec-ades of supervising more than 20,000 shamanistic sessions with people fromdiverse cultures using holotrophic breath work and psychedelics. This providesdata for characterizing structures of consciousness that fall outside of those con-ventionally recognized in Western psychology. In addition to the traditional bio-graphical level of consciousness created in a person’s experiences from infancyonward, there are two other major levels of consciousness—the perinatal andthe transpersonal. Theperinatallevel reflects birth trauma experiences; whilethetranspersonallevels reflect dimensions of consciousness that extend beyonda person’s body and ego. Both of these levels of consciousness are central todeath-rebirth experiences and other aspects of shamanic practices. In comparinghis findings with those of shamanistic systems, Grof (1992, 17) concluded that “theancient spiritual systems had actually charted with amazing accuracy differentlevels and types of experiences that occur in non-ordinary states of consciousness.”Shamanistic techniques for altering consciousness reveal aspects of the deep struc-tures of human consciousness and psyche, providing the organism with mecha-nisms “to free the bonds of various traumatic imprints and limitations, heal itself,and reach a more harmonious way of functioning” (19).Grof described these structures as organizing the psyche and the unconsciouswith themes fundamental to both positive and negative emotional experiences oflife, particularly, anxiety, fury, pain, and suffocation. Grof analyzed perinatal phe-nomena as involving four distinct experiential phases or matrices: (1) the amnioticuniverse; (2) cosmic engulfment; (3) the death-rebirth struggle; and (4) death andrebirth. These four perinatal matrices are aspects of the structures of the uncon-scious. Grof (1992) referred to structures formed around the experiences of agonyand ecstasy of birth as “volcanic” or “Dionysian” ecstasy. This is a combination ofthe polar opposite experiences of pain and pleasure and is induced in shamanicrituals through painful induction procedures. The death-rebirth experience’s cul-mination is the struggle of “ ‘ego death,’ an experience of total annihilation on alllevels—physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual” (73). Grof characterized thisloss as the death of one’s paranoid aspects, one’s false egos that view the worldas dangerous and that feel the need to be in control to guard against danger. Thesense of rebirth that follows this release from fear produces a sense of great energy,114SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"which may be interpreted as light, pure god, or unitive feeling of reunion with thetrue self.ANALOGICAL THOUGHT AND METAPHORIN SHAMANISMMental models represent structural analogues of the world, with images as theirperceptual correlates. This mapping provides the basis for pattern-recognitionprocesses that underlie all forms of reasoning, from primitive categorizationthrough logical inference. This construction of meaning is based primarily in ana-logue processes that map relations between systems through metaphoric processes.These metaphors are analogical tropes involving the ability of something to resem-ble, represent, or stand for something else (Friedrich 1991), such as in totemism,where animal species represent social groups.Innate models are used in cultural-meaning construction, which involvesanalogical processing linking socially derived experiences to capacities of theseinnate capacities for metaphoric models (Shore 1996). Culture plays a fundamentalrole in the formation of metaphoric models (e.g., see Fernandez 1991), and theseanalogies may be derived from cultural traditions that provide their meaningsand functions. Consequently, formal tropes have considerable differences acrosscultures. The universals of the shamanic world view are not, however, derived fromculturally unique interpretations, but reflect underlying psychobiological structuresthat are manifested in basic tropes.Friedrich (1991) placed these processes of analogy and metaphor in thebroader context of the different types of macrotropes (imagetic, modal,contiguity-based, formal, and analogical), which constitute independent and non-hierarchical systems. Image tropes “represent various kinds of perceptual imagesthat ‘stand for themselves’....Epistemologically, these tropes depend on theexperience or feeling of qualities that are in some sense primary or irreducible”(Friedrich 1991, 27). For example, the skeleton is a perceptual image of the per-son long after death and hence a natural symbol of death. Image tropes are omni-present in language use because of their pervasive presence in mimesis. Forexample, we imply a search for knowledge and understanding by intently lookingat or for something, and “seeing” is a basic metaphor for understanding. “Do youseewhat I am saying?” “Can youseea way out of this situation?” Modal tropesinvolve the underlying matrix of emotions that are at the basis of shamanic healing.Modal tropes are concerned with expressions of mood, as well as with the combi-nation and interaction of moods. Modal tropes function as deep, organizing prin-ciples that are rooted in a mimetic expression of emotions and feelings, as well astheir synthesis through symbolic mediation.Analogical schematization refers to processes of translation between innermodels and outer models, which provide the basis for the construction of mean-ing. Analogical schematization occurs at a number of different cognitive levels;the body and its ability to act are the most fundamental of these schema. Forexample, “Are weheadingin the same direction on this? Can you get yourarmsCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES115"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"around this? I know it is amouthfulbut see if you canswallowthis idea andstomachit” Anatomical features and relations constitute the basis for a varietyof contiguity tropes that use analogies between body parts and other contexts.Various forms of analogical representations are found throughout shamanism,for instance, the body-referenced out-of-body experience. Friedrich characterizedthis projection of anatomical relations as the most powerful and universal formof metaphor based in part/whole relations. Anatomical relations are at the core ofshamanic contributions to human cognitive evolution beyond the mind-in-bodyinto the mental spheres of abstracted image-based knowledge.Animism and Analogical ProcessesThe use of the body and self to represent “other things” is epitomized in the qual-ities of animism. Processes of metaphoric thinking in shamanic thought includeanimism, the belief in spirit beings, particularly its anthropomorphic attributionof humanlike qualities to nonhumans. A basic metaphoric reference in shamanicthought involves spirits that are conceptualized through representations derivedfrom one’s own sense of a disembodied self and mind (Winkelman 2004a).Around the world, spirits are conceptualized in terms of their humanlike mental,personal, emotional, behavioral, and social qualities. Humans and their qualitiesare models of—metaphors for—the structures and princples of the unknownforces conceptualized as spirits. Attributing human qualities to the unknown isexemplified in the humanlike mental and emotional characteristics of gods, spirits,nonhuman entities, and even animals. Metaphoric thought involving attribution ofhuman characteristics to animals and vice versa is ubiquitous in shamanistic prac-tice, manifested in animal familiars and transformation, totemism, and the guard-ian spirit complex.Tylor (1871) suggested that animism constituted the original basis of religion,derived from the primitive philosopher’s attempts to explain the differencesbetween alive and dead, awake and asleep, and the meaning of dreams—phenomenathat are fundamental to distinctions related to consciousness. Tylor proposed thatprimitive philosophers falsely reasoned that a spirit, an animating principle sepa-rable from the body, was responsible for the differences between life and death,waking and sleeping, and for the content of dreams. The presence of a humanlikespirit in the body explained life and waking consciousness, whereas its absencecaused sleep, dream experiences, and even death. Guthrie (1993) recharacterizedthis aspect of religion as providing explanations through anthropomorphizing—offering the concept of humanlike beings that provide the design and the purposeto the observed phenomena of the universe. Guthrie (1997, 489) suggested that theinfluences selecting for animistic beliefs lie in “perceptual uncertainty and the gam-ing strategy with which we meet it.” Humans’ attribution of humanlike characteris-tics to the unknown is not based on a desire to find comfort, but in an effort to makesure that they do not fail to respond to a humanlike actor if necessary.Bird-David (1999) reframed Guthrie’s position, suggesting that the humantendency to animate things is engendered by socially based cognitive skills.Bird-David proposed an interpretation of animism as a relational epistemology116SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"derived from relations with the environment. Animism is central to hunter-gatherer societies because people share with the environment through relationsthat enable humans to be situated in their world. They personify animal andother entities to create relations in which they socialize and share with them.Bird-David suggested that there is a universality to this relational mode ofanimistic principles because the concept of spirits represents “super persons”who are central to sharing relationships with the environment. This relationshipis central to developing personhood and communal affairs and maintainingidentity. These spirits are models providing common images of the other forinternalization in self-development.Shamanic Flight: The Out-of-Body ExperienceSelf-development is also central to soul flight, soul journey, out-of-body experi-ence, and astral projection, experiences involving a universal and essential featureof shamanism: the experiences of some personal aspect of the self which leaves thebody and travels to the spiritual or supernatural world where one encountersother entities. The neurognostic basis of the shamanic soul flight is indicated bythe cross-cultural distribution of experiences sharing a common structure: theout-of-body experience (Shields 1978; Alvarado 2000); near-death or clinicaldeath experiences (Greyson 2000; Moody 1975; Ring 1981, 1986; Sabom 1982);and “astral projection” experiences (Blackmore 1982; Green 1968; Irwin 1985;McIntosh 1980). Although there are important distinctions among these experi-ences and shamanistic visionary experiences found cross-culturally, they sharesome basic experiential features and structures. These homologies indicate thatthe core shamanic experience—soul flight—is an innate psychophysiologicalstructure reflecting neurognostic structures and psychosocial processes.This biological basis is supported by Shields’s (1978) cross-cultural study ofbelief in the out-of-body experience, which he found to be reported nearly univer-sally. Phenomena sharing fundamental experiential similarities with shamanisticsoul journey occur both spontaneously and deliberately among modern popula-tions (Blackmore 1982; Green 1968; McIntosh 1980). The availability of these expe-riences is widely attested to in postmodern cultures by individuals who seek out theshamanic path (Harner 1982). These individuals report experiences similar to thoseof shamans—flying through diverse worlds, interacting with spirit beings, andacquiring information about both the ordinary and nonordinary realities. Thisexperience in which some aspect of the person—soul, spirit, or perceptualcapacities—is thought to travel to or to be projected to another place is not anexclusive property of shamanism. Rather, it is a potential available to people whoavail themselves of the experiences that evoke these innate structures, as indicatedby the near universality of reports of these experiences (Shields 1978). Althoughthe ASC of mystics, mediums, and other shamanistic practitioners are not typicallysoul journey or flight, similar experiences may occur in the meditative traditionsand can be developed assiddhis, the psychic powers associated with meditativedevelopment (Eliade 1969). These shamanistic experiences are also similar to thespontaneously occurring near-death experience, where individuals come close toCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES117"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"physical death from accident or trauma or may be clinically dead for some periodof time before resuscitation. During the period of clinical death a set of core expe-riences emerges in the most complete cases that mirror features of the shamanicsoul journey.The Near-Death Experience and Soul FlightMany basic features of the shamanic soul flight are paralleled in a natural trans-formation of consciousness that is produced in response to trauma, as illustratedin the widely studied near-death or clinical death experiences (Blackmore 1982;Greyson 2000; Moody 1975; Ring 1986; Saboom 1982; Schoonmaker 1979). Theseinvolve circumstances where, according to clinical evidence, the people die, butthey are eventually resuscitated and return to life with incredible stories of theirexperiences.The near-death experience (NDE) typically involves a sense of the self oftenidentified as the soul separating from the body and moving upward; an observationof the physical body in a different location from their sense of self and point ofview; a movement away into a hole, tunnel, or portal and eventually anotherworld; and encountering a bright light, spiritual beings, and perhaps God anddeceased relatives. The individual is usually told to return to the physical worldand may reenter the tunnel to return to the body.The NDEs are generally profoundly positive emotional experiences, a joyousentry into the afterlife. The person is, nonetheless, told to return to the physicalworld where they then reenter their body and return to life. Alive and in theirbodies again, they remained convinced of the reality of their experience, of theeternal immortality of their soul, and their eventual return to the afterlife.In addition to these features, there are a variety of common mystical themesthat occur in some near-death experiences, including ineffability, a sense of aninability to explain the experience in words; positive affective features of peace,tranquility, calm, and joy; a panoramicreview of one’s life and other dramaticvisual images and memories; an experience of being all-knowing or experiencingthe realm of universal knowledge; a sense of hyperalertness or awareness; a deepdepersonalization, including a sense of complete separation from the body; detach-ment and loss of emotion; a sense of cosmic unity; transcendence of the physicalworld and an engagement with supernatural realities; and an experience of a void,nothingness, a realm of total nonexistence.The source of the phenomenology of the NDE must be in biology since it ismanifested in such similar ways across cultures. Its innate nature is reflected inthe complete accounts of NDE experiences by young children never subjectedto such information. These experiences are not merely a product of modernmedicine and its enhanced abilities to bring people back from the brink of death.The NDE was a well-described clinical phenomenon in the nineteenth century,provided by people who had recovered from near-death or unconsciousness fromdrowning, accidents, war wounds, and other traumas (Greyson 2000). The inher-ent nature of these experiences is reflected in the reports from a large percentageof contemporary people who nearly die; there are reports by about half of all118SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"children who survived critical illnesses that were potentially fatal (Greyson).While the severity of the health crisis may contribute to evoking these experien-ces, they can also be provoked by a fear of death rather than the actual physicalthreat or debilitation, being also reported by individuals without trauma ororganic brain malfunctions (Greyson).The universality of NDEs suggests that they are related to biology, but asby-products or as adaptive benefits? In the modern world, these NDEs typicallyhave a profound and beneficial psychological impact on the person, transformingthe personality to one with an increased concern with religion and spirituality.They often manifest in dramatic increases in selfless behaviors, a focusing on theimportance of personal relationships, helping others, and a profound engage-ment with spirituality and the afterlife. Such individuals almost look forward todeath, but engage vigorously with life in overcoming challenges and exhibiting aspiritual purpose in their compassionate behavior towards others (Greyson, Ring).This suggests that spirituality is a normal by-product or outcome of these experien-ces, engaging an altruistic dynamic well-recognized for its adaptive benefits. Suchenhanced altruistic behavior could have further fixed the near-death spirit/soulexperiences.The near-death experience of one’s self as a spirit or soul suggests that it mayhave been a factor leading to postulating of spirits and the generation of religiousbeliefs in general. Like religion, NDEs can be seen as a personal engagement witha fantasy world that protects one from the emotional shock of reality—imminentdeath—a form of dissociation that provides for emotional tranquility. The out-of-body experience (OBE) self provides an antidote for anxiety regarding thephysical trauma to self and body, an assurance of continuity in the face of poten-tially mortal crisis. Engagement with an image of a pleasant afterlife allows one toremain calm and to preserve one’s energies while awaiting assistance from others.This engagement with an alternative reality, referred to in the psychological liter-ature by terms such as “fantasy proneness” and “absorption,” is intimately relatedto other aspects of human consciousness such as hypnotic susceptibility and dis-sociation. The occurrence of these kinds of anomalous experiences is part of thenatural response of the organism to threats to its well-being. This is illustratedin other natural sources of mystical SoC, those associated with fasting, self-mortification, and the induction of sleeplessness (see Chapter 4). The NDE fea-tures provide an important point of reference for recognizing the neurognosticbasis of a variety of features of mystical and shamanistic experiences, as well asdrug-induced altered states of consciousness.Soul Flight as Symbolism: Body Image MetaphorsThe communality in experiences across diverse cultures suggests that the shaman’ssoul flight derives from an archetypal or neurognostic structure. Laughlin,McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) illustrate how the experience of soul flight involvesa natural symbolization of the shaman’s transformative experiences and experienceof transcendence. Flight and ascension metaphorically reflect the movement of theshaman’s consciousness upward through the levels of consciousness.CONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES119"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Laughlin (1997) provides a biogenetic structuralist assessment of the bodyimage to illustrate why use of the body as a symbol system is universal, as wellas at the center of shamanic cultures. This somatocentric-derived cosmology usesthe innately structured body image as a neurocognitive model with whichhumans organize diverse forms of internal and external experiences. Althoughthe model of the body develops under sociocultural influences, it begins as alargely hardwired program that constitutes a neurognostic foundation for humanexperience. This body image is a construct of the nervous system, incorporatingsensory, somatic, and skeletal information, as well as memory. These organiza-tional principles are largely genetically determined, providing universal patternsof neural activity, specific behavioral and experiential components, and phenom-enal body attributes central to the organism’s synthesis of “conceptual, imaginal,affective, metabolic, and motor operations....[Body and self image are] composedof symbolic transformations of meaning at various levels of organization, fromprimitive arousal, vestibular, postural, metabolic interoception, and affect to moreadvanced conceptual and imaginal functions” (Laughlin 1997, 52). These bodyimages combine memory and perception, which enable the evocation of the imageto produce associated effects on affects, sentiments and emotional cognition.Although the body as metaphor—exemplified in the OBE—is central to themajor SoC of shamanism, the experience is primarily visual. Hunt (1995a) char-acterized the OBE as a synesthesia based on visual images of the body and bodilysensations, a presentational metaphor that is at the basis of the cross-culturalsimilarity of accounts regarding OBEs. The OBE involves complex synesthesiasbased in the capacity for cross-modal translation across perceptual modalities.Central to Hunt’s perspectives is Mead’s (1934) work on the capacity of humansto “take the role of the other”—communicative interactions in which one moni-tors messages from others to construct a model of the general social perceptionsregarding one’s self and personal characteristics. Hunt proposes that the proto-type of soul journey involves the capacity to take for one’s self the imagined per-spectives of others. This is manifested in using visual imagery to represent one’sown body as it would appear from another’s perspectives rather than one’s own.The taking of the perspectives of the other toward one’s self provides a formof self-awareness or consciousness. This capacity for self-reference involvingimagining and internalizing the expressions of others toward self is most obviousin speech and verbal thought.Out-of-body experiences involve manifestationsof this self-referential capacity in a visual-spatial mode operating independentof the constraints of the physical body/world. This reflexive self-awareness providesthe capacity to direct awareness at one’s own ongoing subjective experiences, aswell as explore aspects of visual-spatial memory.The Biological Bases of the Out-of-Body ExperienceThe OBE is similar to a broader class of anomalous body and self experiences(such as autoscopy and sleep paralysis) that may also exhibit the central featuresof OBEs, such as flying, falling, floating, and spinning. These anomalous self-body experiences may also involve alien presence syndromes or the sense of a felt120SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"presence, someone or something nearby. This sense of a felt presence may includevisual perceptions of a presence. Various self-hallucinatory syndromes (heauto-scopy, autoscopy, OBE, sleep paralysis) have different degrees of identity with abody that is present. The classic OBE sees the body as one’s own but distinctlydifferent from the locus of subjectivity and self. At the other extreme, the bodyis not identified as related to self, but experienced as an alien presence or intruder.The intruder is not recognized as the self, but such common identity is suggestedby the typical features of understanding the thoughts and intentions of the alienintruder.OBE and related anomalous body-self experiences help reveal the functionalarchitecture underlying human consciousness, particularly, the relationships ofthe elements involved in producing a sense of self and body consciousness. OBEsreflect three aspects of abnormal self-representation: the self experience as lackingunity; the self as located in a different place than normal (generally above thephysical body); and the visual perspective of seeing the world and one’s own bodyfrom a different perspective than the body (Metzinger 2005, 2009). These OBEexperiences illustrate the predominant role of the visual field over the somaticfield in the experience of the self.Neural and Functional Correlates of AnomalousBody-Self ExperiencesBlanke and associates5have identified the neural correlates and likely causes ofOBEs and related anomalous body-self experiences through studies of clinicalpopulations with similar experiences and with laboratory studies in which OBE-like experiences are induced in normal people. OBE-like experiences of a senseof the self at a location different than that of the body can be produced by severalmeans: electrical brain stimulation of select brain regions; manipulation of tactile,mental, and visual data, particularly, by false visual feedback regarding actualbody location; through mental and visual simulation of various positions forthe body; and by manipulation of conflicting sensory inputs regarding the body.This data indicates the area of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) as centralto the neural mechanisms underlyinganomalous body experiences. Evokedpotential mapping and transcranial magnetic stimulation identified selectivebrain activation associated with OBEs at the TPJ. OBE and other anomalous phe-nomena reflect interference with the normal integration of body-related informa-tion in the TPJ. In addition to interference in the TPJ, other factors must also beconsidered in the self-model disintegration and disattention to external visualinformation that permit the dominance of the internal visual frame of reference.The TPJ is adjacent to areas responsible for the integration of somatosensoryinformation and the vestibular system that provide balance. The TPJ mediateslow-level vestibular processing, as well as the interaction among the higher levelprocesses that underlie the production of a sense of the phenomenal self. The ves-tibular cortex functions as an area for multisensory integration of vestibularinformation and visual, proprioceptive, and tactile cues to coordinate signalsregarding body movement and position. Interference with this integration orCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES121"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"the transfer of vestibular information toother parts of the brain can lead toaltered senses of body ownership and disembodiment. The TPJ has a central rolein managing mental imagery regarding one’s own body, mediating self and bodyinputs that underlie the normal experience of the unity of the self (Lopez, Halje,and Blanke 2008). Interference with the linkages across vestibular, proprioceptive,and tactile senses and their match with visual references produces disintegrationsof subjective self-consciousness with body ownership and embodiment.Those disposed to OBE also have interference with interconnections betweenthe TPJ and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a functional disconnection between pari-etal and frontal areas that inhibits egocentric perspectives. While OBEs indicate aloss of connectivity of the motor, somatic, and balance functions of the TPJ areawith the executive and egoic PFC, these experiences are alwaysvisualexperiences,illustrating that self-connectivity with visual regions persists. The self-image ofthe OBE is, however, not engaged with the actual visual field, but an imagined vis-ual field that is also disconnected from actual body proprioception. The illusion ofmovement characteristic of OBE experiences is a feature shared with the dreammode of consciousness—the ability to move experientially without an actual move-ment of the body. The loss of this integration of information regarding balance andmotor experience underlies the ability of the self and experienced false body totravel through space without the actual constraints of the physical body.The OBE indicates interference with the vestibular areas that provide an inte-grated sense of balance central to body sensations. In shamanic OBEs, this deactiva-tion of normal vestibular system functions apparently results from the extensivedancing and drumming by the shaman. These excessive repetitive activities lastinghours can overwhelm the ability of the vestibular system to maintain balance andmanage input about movement. Functional areas of the TPJ are literally overloadedby the excessive stimulation. This habituation is typical of overstimulation, whichleads to shutdown of a sensory system. Consequently, the body-processing andself-processing systems are allowed to operate free of actual body input. Cheyneand Girard (2008) noted that the inputs to the normal bindings of body and self-information include both vestibular and motor components, but proposed that itis the visual-body synesthesia that appears to be the most significant feature trigger-ing the perception of an anomalous body-self relationship.Metzinger (2005) noted that the OBE features include a “cluster of func-tional and phenomenological core properties similar to the proto-concept ofmind” (2005, 57). OBEs and related anomalous body-self experiences providean opportunity to examine the separate components that contribute to ordinaryawareness. These special forms of mental representation provide functional proper-ties and processes, with the two self-models present in OBE providing potentiallyadaptive features manifested in this proto-concept of the mind. A central phenom-enal feature of the OBE models is a visual representation of one’s own body fromthird-person perspectives—seeing yourself from the perspective of someone else.The body seen is not the focus of experience nor of self-identity. Rather, a secondself-representation model—the astral self that is removed from the body—is thelocus of the phenomenal perceiving self and subjective experience, includingproprioceptive and spatial perceptions. It is this second self that provides an122SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"integrated representation of reality and has the attentional, experiential, kin-esthetic qualities and the capacities of intentionality. The physical body as per-ceived is not recognized as the experiential self, although it is still seen as linkedto one’s physical identity. Rather it is this disembodied self that has the first-person perspective from which the phenomenal world of spirits and supernaturalpowers are experienced.Metzinger characterized the OBE as a phenomenal self-model, “an inte-grated, conscious representation of the organismas a whole,includingspatialfeatures...[and] its own psychological properties” (2005, 59). Metzinger notedthat the OBE has a particularly important feature of transparency, that the persondoes not recognize the self-experience as a model, but, rather, takes a naı ̈ve realistperspective that experiences the OBE model as the self. Nonetheless, there may beawareness of nonveridical and contradictory features of the OBE experience withrespect to the physical world.Metzinger suggested adaptive and functional features of the OBE. The asso-ciated physical immobility parallels freezing responses and feigned deathsexhibited by many animal species when confronted by predators. Such deathmaneuvers may dissuade predators, who instinctively avoid dead prey becauseof its possible contamination. Some of these are extensions of the psychologicalfunctions of dissociative phenomena in self-maintenance (also see Chapter 5).By separating certain capacities from the physical self model (which is uncon-scious), the person preserves vital cognitive functions. The OBE self provides anantidote for anxiety regarding the physical trauma to self and body, an assuranceof continuity in the face of potentially mortal crisis. Metzinger (2005, 69) pro-posed that the mental clarity associated with the OBE may reflect “representa-tional division of labor” and a “transient functional modularization” that allowthe information processing systems to differentially distribute functions to differ-ent self-modules. For instance, when physical trauma cuts off somatosensoryinput, a separate sense of self can play the role of integrating higher cognitivefunctions such as attention, problem representation and solutions, and agencyand volitional processes. The OBE self has notable control over attention andthought processes. The OBE is a perceptual version of self-consciousness, onethat provides a subject representation separated from the body object. In theOBE condition, the phenomenal self, locus of identity, and intentional agentaspects of the person are now free to explore possibilities independent of the spa-tial and perceptual limitations of the physical body. This allows the higher cogni-tive functions to control attention and use categorical thought to provide a globalmodel. These phenomena also tell us something about the constituents of ouressential identity. Although the OBE self is egocentric and referenced to a bodyand space, “spatial self-representation and cognitive self-reference are not necessaryfor selfhood” (Metzinger 2005, 70).Metzinger contended that the OBE involves a veridical, accurate, and truth-ful experiential account. The neurological and functional substrate of the experi-ences is responsible for the human tendencies to postulate the existence of souls, afolk phenomenology that reflects our neural architecture for self-modeling. OBEexperiences have undoubtedly been at the basis of human’s postulation of spirits,CONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES123"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"souls, and other supernatural phenomena. OBEs are an empirical experience anda subjective paradigm for humanity’s construction of cognized models of theworld. The force of the OBE experiences invariably leads to dualist perceptions ofreality, seeing the material and mental aspects, body and soul, as separate, and con-cluding that consciousness exists apart from the physical body (Metzinger 2008,2009). These phenomena are the basis of a neurophenomenological archetype ofhumanity, a reflection of a neuropsychological potential that is at the basis of theexperience of one’s self as a soul-like entity.These perceptions may be erroneous, but their experiential impact must beseen as central to the generation of mythological and cosmological systems andtheir associated spiritual beliefs. Metzinger noted that even if they are confabula-tory states, they may nonetheless be “information-bearing states correctly repre-senting certain aspects of the environment” (2005, 78). Although the assumptionsof these models regarding the actual relations among the perceived body, the expe-riential self, the actual body, and the physical world may be materially wrong, thefalsely cognized environments, nonetheless, have effects on behavior. These includedeveloping explanations of the nature of humans and the universe and presump-tions about the possibilities and powers of a spiritual and supernatural dimensionthat exceeds those inherent in human capacities (see Chapter 6 for elaborations).The central features of soul flight reflect fundamental characteristics ofhuman consciousness. These experiences are at the basis of a theoretical self-awareness and self-modeling that move beyond the primitive concrete processes.The OBE reflects our ability to transcend the present moment and to experienceboth the past and predict our future. Arzy, Molnar-Szakacs, and Blanke (2008)called this “mental time travel” (MTT), a uniquely human facility to experiencethe self traveling back in time and to future events. This mental time travel to thepast and future involves similar neural mechanisms and brain regions. Arzy et al.examined the neural correlates of this time-travel experience by combining electri-cal neuroimaging and evoked potential (EP) mapping of the brain with behavioralmeasures. The ability of study participants to project themselves into future eventsmore quickly than into past events indicates that our “time travel” capacity pri-marily functions in anticipating future events. They conclude that our capacitiesfor MTT reflect selection for mental processing of future predictions and rapiddecision making regarding anticipated behaviors.CONCLUSIONS: SHAMANIC CONSCIOUSNESSAS SPECIAL KNOWLEDGEEtymological analyses and multidisciplinary approaches concur that among themany meanings of consciousness is a fundamental concern with an informationalrelationship between an organism and its environment, the processes and proper-ties of “knowing” systems. The different processes and structures that can pro-duce information about the environment and the knower (self) provide thebasis for many different forms of consciousness. These different selves mediatethe epistemic relationships that the knower constructs between the organism124SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"and the reality known. Shamanic knowledge emphasizes the use of body-basedimages and analogy to provide a number of natural systems of expressing emo-tions and personal identity in visual or presentational symbolism. Shamanic tra-ditions involve modes of knowing that provide an extension of representationthrough metaphorical predication based on the body, the self, animals, and socialothers. Shamanic experiences and thought play important roles in representingbasic human perceptual and conceptual structures. Shamanic thought extendsthese in analogical and metaphoric thought processes, producing a variety of syn-thetic integrations that provide individual and collective self-representations ofsocial life and self. Shamanistic phenomena such as soul flight and death-and-rebirth involve representations of self that reflect self-development.The soul flight of shamanism reflects a variety of human cognitive adapta-tions that took our ancient hominin consciousness beyond the bases in concretematerial mind and extended it spatially and temporally. The OBE requires themimetic capacity and exceeds it. This mimetic capacity provided the ancientbody-based sense of awareness as a physical reference that is explicitly exceeded inthe out-of-body experience of soul flight. This parallels the shift in cognitive devel-opment from body-based concrete reference to abstract context-independentthought. These experiences provided the basis for essential aspects of consciousnessand its evolution. These more abstract levels of self representation involved spiritand soul concepts, such as those manifested in the experiences of alter-identitiesin the spirit world of animal allies.NOTES1. I have relied primarily on Kitchener’s (1986) extensive analysis of Piaget’s episte-mology as the basis for this characterization.2. Piaget’s (1969, 1971) stages of development are cognitive in an epistemic sense, that isto say, concerned with issues of the nature of knowing and the evidence and justificationsregarding questions of truth. These epistemic concepts include perceptions; sensorimotorschemes and operations; categories such as space, time, causality, and object permanence;formal categories such as classification, number, and quantity; semiotic categories (ideas,images, symbols, signs); and a variety of moral, emotional, and social categories (Kitchner1986, 41). Piaget’s epistemology is Kantian, combining both empirical and developmentalelements in extending Kant’s perspective through constructivism, the epistemic subjects’construction of their knowledge. Piaget emphasizes “the active cognitive role of the episte-mological subject in interpreting, categorizing, and structuring experience” (Kitchner, 75)and constructing knowledge and objects. Piaget’s conceptions of reality and knowledge cor-respond to Kantian notions of noumena and phenomena. He maintains a distinctionbetween metaphysics and epistemology, differentiating epistemological issues of what isknown from metaphysical questions of what really exists. This distinction is made by Kantbetween the metaphysical object (the thing-in-itself, ornoumenon) and the epistemologicalobject (the thing-as-known, orphenomenon) (paraphrase from Kitchener 1986, 104). Piagetalso incorporates the Kantian notion that there are certain concepts and categories that arenecessary for knowledge, including the formal laws of logic; concepts of space and time;and ideas such as cause, quantity, and classification that are imposed on experience. He alsoadds additional concepts and categories not considered essential by Kant. Piaget’s differenceCONSCIOUSNESS IN SYSTEM PERSPECTIVES125"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"with the Kantian formulation is that he claims that there is a developmental processunderlying those structures, rather than representing fixed (transcendental) categories.Piaget’s theories involve an “interactionism” in which the subject’s interaction with the envi-ronment through the epistemic structures employed in the processes of assimilation andaccommodation is essential for knowledge.3. Reflective abstraction is characteristic of each stage of epistemic development,involving the abstraction of elements from an earlier stage and their reflection onto ahigher stage where they are restructured. Reflective abstraction consists in the transposi-tion of properties from actions on the object onto a higher plane, where the structure ofa lower level becomes the content of a higher level and subject to logical coordination bythe epistemic subject’s actions. Reflective abstraction involves two aspects: (1) reflectingas a projection from a lower plane to a higher plane, and (2) reflecting as a process of cog-nitive reorganization of the projected material. Reflective abstraction involves a creativereconstruction, operations on operations. Reflective abstraction is an unconscious process,but it can lead to both conscious products and formulations, as well as to unconsciousresults, especially when the phenomena cannot be incorporated into the conscious systemof concepts.4. The possibility that consciousness may exist in nonsymbolic forms is explored inChapter 4 in reference to void-consciousness.5.

The different states of consciousness (SoC) inthe IMC follow several principal patterns, which are manifested cross-culturallyin three major forms: (1) shamanic soul flight; (2) mystical/meditative states;and (3) mediumistic/possession. These consciousness traditions also have a vari-ety of different states of consciousness (SoC) within them, for instance, soul flightand death-and-rebirth SoC within shamanism. In this chapter, the primary ritualinduction procedures of these different traditions are examined in terms of theirphysiological effects. This illustrates bases for differences in shamanistic SoC andhow diverse procedures nonetheless engage functionally similar SoC, producingincreased synchronization and coherence in the slow brain wave patterns. Sha-manic SoC stress the body to a sympathetic extreme to provoke a parasympatheticresponse to alter consciousness, while meditative traditions emphasize a directparasympathetic approach that diminishes body activity. “Possession” SoC capital-ize on existing neurological sensitivities to select practitioners with a tendency toenter various SoC. The different SoC of the shamanistic traditions are examinedin terms of differences in physiological, emotional, self, and social parameters,including their sociocultual influences, cultural beliefs regarding them, phenom-enologically different experiences (e.g., flight, external domination, and void),and physiologic and behavioral conditions (e.g., amnesia, convulsions, uncon-sciousness, and dissociation). These different forms of consciousness are examinedfrom an epistemological perspective that links the characteristics of the IMC tofunctions of brain subsystems, particularly, the elicitation of the paleomentationand the emotiomentation processes of lower brain structures (R-complex andlimbic brain). This engagement allows for management of emotions, attachment,social relations and sense of self. Although possession and dissociative experiences127"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"do not appear as typical exemplars of the IMC, their integrative aspects are alsoseen in dissociative and possession states at physiological, psychological, andcultural levels.INTRODUCTION: DIFFERENT STATESOF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE INTEGRATIVEMODE OF CONSCIOUSNESSSimilar descriptions of SoC experiences are found cross-culturally, with people indiverse times and places giving similar reports regarding the phenomenal natureof their spontaneous and deliberate experiences. The idea that there are substan-tial similarities in the mystical experiences of many cultures has been long notedin the idea of a perennial philosophy, that there are universal spiritual truths andexperiences reported in religions around the world (Smith 1976). These similar-ities in religious experiences were a central point of Stace’s (1960, 1961) classicworkMysticism and Philosophy, which contended that the common characteristicsof mystical experiences, in addition to their sacredness, included being ineffable,incapable of being expressed in ordinary language and conceptual categories;being transient rather than permanent; passive, occurring outside of will andintention; having paradoxical and contradictory properties, with a sense of unityand the reconciliation of opposites; possessing the quality of nonconceptual andintuitive perception of ultimate truth; having a strong affective tone, both positiveand negative, but particularly with powerful positive emotions such as joy andbliss; and producing a sense of the development-enhanced discernment.However, many mystics and scholars have also emphasized that there aredifferent types of mystical experiences. Stace proposed a distinction betweentwo principal types of mystical experience: extrovertive mystical experiences,where there is a perception of oneness, a unity with all of the universe; and intro-vertive mysticism, typified by a “void consciousness,” an experience in which allsensation and conceptualization, including a sense of self, time, and space, disap-pear into a state of nothingness.Hood (e.g., see Hood et al. 2001) has assessed these constructs of introvertiveand extrovertive mysticism in cross-cultural research, establishing their validityas objective principles representing two poles of mystical experience. People indifferent cultures have experienced similar conditions of extrovertive mysticism,such as feeling absorbed as one with all of the universe; a sense that all thingsare alive and aware; a sense of one’s self and all of the universe, a merger of the selfwith the Universe; a sense that time and space do not exist, with all of the uni-verse part of the same whole, a sense of the unity of all things. People in diversecultures have also encountered a different dynamic, the introvertive mysticalexperiences of a sense of timelessness and spacelessness, a void or total absenceof anything; and absorption into something greater than the self that was inca-pable of expression in words or language.Similarities in mystical and other shamanistic experiences across time and cul-tures must to some extent reflect something intrinsic to our nature, manifesting a128SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"neurophenomenology, a neurological structuring of phenomenal experience.Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) suggested that manipulation of the divi-sions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a key to understanding thesecross-cultural patterns in mystical experiences. Laughlin et al. (1992) proposed thatmanipulations of the ergotropic-trophotropic balance of the ANS are the basis forexperiences of higher phases of consciousness. These experiences are characterizedby homeomorphogenetic relationships—sharing common form—between theactivities of the ergotropic-trophotropic nervous system and the experiences, whichare the result of proprioceptive sensing of energies in the ANS and endocrinalsystem and the sympathetic plexus of the body (nerve bundles and concentrationscorresponding to the chakras).Diverse procedures activate the ANS and its ergotropic and trophotropicdivisions. Laughlin et al. propose that extreme activation of either the ergotrophicor trophotropic system (sympathetic andparasympathetic divisions of the ANS), ortheir combined stimulation, can produce a variety of mystical experiences. Theextreme ergotrophic activation (“hyperergotrophic tuning”) produces the ecstaticsense of endless energy, the quintessential “flow experience,” that can result fromextreme motor activity such as prolonged dancing and long-distance running.Extreme trophotropic activation (“hypertrophotropic tuning”) produces extraordi-nary relaxation typical of sleep but experienced in meditation as a sense of peaceful-ness and “oceanic tranquility” and a total loss of body sensations. Hunt (1995a)suggested that the physiological states of trophotropic activation involve such pro-found muscular relaxation that it induces a feeling of “letting go” that produces adeep sense of calm and, consequently, detachment and acceptance.Elicitation of these two extremes of the ANS also may be combined in othermystical experiences, such as the “active bliss experiences” produced during hyper-ergotropic tuning with ergotrophic eruption, and the orgasmic rapture and ecstaticrush, produced by trophotropic eruption during hyperergotropic tuning. Any ofthese experiences may be perceived as “ecstatic,” reflecting the powerful activationof the basic stimulatory and/or relaxation features of our nervous system and theassociated structures of the limbic or paleomammalian brain.Experiences similar to those produced in deep meditative states and sleeptransitions are cultivated by a variety of shamanic practices, and appear to benatural consequences of the activation of neurognostic structures. But if thesechanges in the ANS alone were sufficient for ecstatic and mystical experiences,they would not be the uniquely human capacities that they appear to be. Spiritualexperience has long been regarded as a uniquely human capacity, and likelyreflects effects of humans’ evolved symbolic capacities.To understand these transcendental or transpersonal dimensions of the altera-tion of consciousness requires a framework that goes beyond the simplistic contrastwith the valued properties of the baseline state of consciousness or waking mode ofconsciousness. The qualities of these SoC in the IMC that make them significant areconcerns with special forms of knowing related to the processes dominated by ourancient reptilian and paleomammalian brains. These processes of consciousnessmake available a variety of prelanguage structures and processes of knowing, a richsymbolic information system preceding the language-based rational consciousnessTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS129"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"of modern humans. What characterizes the special nature of these forms of knowinginvolves the integration of these ancient levels of understanding into the processesof the frontal brain and our more advanced senses of self. This is a psychointegra-tion of behavioral and emotional processes into our preeminently symbolic brainprocesses through elevation of the preconscious protosymbolic processes of theancient reptilian and paleomammalian brains. However, there are also variant kindsof shamanistic and mystical experiences. These differences involve several factors:the specific technologies of consciousness used in different traditions, which are asdiverse as dancing, dream engagement and drugs; and the interactions of underly-ing psychobiological structures of self and identity with the psychosocial dynamicsof the culture.Shamanistic SoC in the IMCTerms such as shamanic journey, vision quest, soul flight, possession, medium-ship, mystical union, and others have been used to refer to the various SoC.While some of these may be synonymous, others are distinctly different. Cross-cultural analysis (Winkelman 1986b, 1990, 1992) of many descriptive featuresof ritually induced alterations ofconsciousness among religious practitionersindicates three primary forms of SoC: shamanic soul flight, meditation, andmediumistic possession. The three primary clusters of SoC types and the associ-ated altered state induction variables are•soul flight—preparatory restrictions (such as fasting, celibacy) followed byextensive chanting, drumming, and excessive motor behavior (e.g., dancing),leading to a collapse and period of apparent unconsciousness during night-time rituals;•meditative absorption—induced by an internal focus, often using auditorydriving (e.g., chanting and drumming), as well as sleep deprivation, fasting,austerities, and sensory deprivation; and•possession—characterized by factors indicating neurological predispositionsto epilepsy-like seizure phenomena involving spontaneous tremors, convul-sions, and amnesia and responded to in rituals involving singing, chanting,and percussive music.Across all of these three principal types of SoC are commonalities in the useof music, singing, and percussion. The perspective of the IMC emphasizes thecommonalities underlying these diverse SoC, but they also have physiologicaldifferences among them. These differences reflect the use of ritual techniques withvery different effects on the ANS, as well as practices of selecting specific psychiatricprofiles for mediumistic possession. While some, like shamanism, emphasize thestimulation of the ANS, the meditative traditions tend to emphasize the opposite,a relaxation response. But they, too, may use sympathetic nervous system-activating activities like dance. What is common to all of these SoC is the end stateof parasympathetic dominance and the integrative brain wave patterns that are130SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"associated with them. Previc (2009) has proposed that these commonalities reflectdirect and indirect activation of the dopamine system.Shamanic SoCThe cross-cultural similarity in shamanic soul flight and its structural similaritieswith many features of near-death experiences indicate that it is a manifestation ofneurognostic structures discussed above in terms of the basic awareness of body.These similarities must in some respects also reflect the effects of the procedurestypically used by shamans to induce their SoC. The typical procedures includeintensive periods of drumming, dancing, and singing that lead to collapse andunconsciousness. These basic dynamics indicate that the sympathetic nervoussystem is activated to the point of exhaustion, which leads to collapse and parasym-pathetic dominance. Shamanic practices use a variety of agents and procedures tomanipulate the sympathetic nervous system to the point of exhaustion and collapseinto a parasympathetic dominant state in which the shaman experiences visions.Shamans and initiates typically engage in procedures such as fasting and water dep-rivation, exposure to temperature extremes, various austerities, sleep deprivation,extensive auditory stimuli (such as drumming and chanting), extensive exercise(such as prolonged dancing to the point of collapse), and psychoactive substances,particularly, psychedelics and tobacco. General principles characterizing shamanicritual induction procedures involve effects on the dopamine, serotonergic, opioid,and endocannabanoid neurotransmitter systems. These effects on neurotransmit-ters involves directly engaging natural drives, either restricting them (i.e., thirst,hunger), inducing them (painful stimuli and dreams), or provoking them withexogenous sources such as psychedelic plants or tobacco. Diverse features of sha-manic SoC induction procedures produce a parasympathetic dominant state withaugmentation and synchronization of alpha and theta brain wave patterns.MeditationMeditative SoC and practices are found in agricultural rather than hunting-gathering societies and across all levels of social complexity. Some of the shamanistichealing practices found in Winkelman’s (1992) cross-cultural research have obviousconnections with the classic mystical traditions, such as the Japanese Buddhistascetic and the Kurd dervishes. Although the meditative SoC are not always directlyapparent, shamanistic healing traditions use many procedures for altering con-sciousness that are found in the Eastern meditative practices, including repetitivechanting, percussion and music, fasting, sexual restrictions, sensory isolation andausterities, and ritual activities that focus and occupy attention. While dominantmeditative traditions emphasize the direct approach to parasympathetic dominantstates, there are traditions that also engage the route of sympathetic stimulation,such as in the dancing of the Islamic mystics, the whirling dervishes. Walsh (1990)nonetheless emphasized important differences between shamanic and meditativeSoC. The shamans’ personality changes involve highly emotionally charged iden-tities that are enacted in a sustained communicative interaction with an audience;THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS131"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"subsequently, during periods of unconsciousness, the shaman’s experiential focus isin an OBE and the content of inner experiences interpreted as nonordinary realities.Meditators may have similar experiences of OBE, but their typical activities contrastwith shamans in terms of more self-control and concentration, lower arousal, asense of calm and emotional detachment, a loss of sense of self, a greater awareness,and contentless experience. Although the meditative practices may have universalaspects, even those who claim universal features also point to a number of distinctSoC within meditative traditions.PossessionThe distinction of possession from other SoC has not been emphasized by someresearchers (e.g., Heinze [1991]; Peters and Price-Williams [1981]; Siikala[1978];). While there is some justification for this subordination of differences ofpossession and soul flight to their commonalities within the IMC, there are, none-theless, good grounds for distinguishing them. Possession SoC experientially differfrom shamanic SoC in emphasizing auditory experiences in contrast to the sha-man’s visionary experience. Furthermore, possession involves domination of theperson by spirit entities, in contrast to the shaman’s control of the spirits. There isan association of possession with specific psychophysiological, psychological, andsocial conditions (Winkelman 1986b, 1990, 1992). The association of possessionwith a psychiatric profile and distinctive physiological conditions (an epilepsy-liketemporal lobe discharge) points to basic differences of possession from shamanicSoC. The different relationships of shamans and mediums to the socioeconomicconditions (hunter-gatherer versus political integration beyond the local commu-nity, respectively) indicate that mediums are the form that the potentials of theIMC take in complex societies. Political and social processes appear responsiblefor prompting the possession conditions involving symptoms of lability in the cen-tral nervous system—compulsive motor behavior, tremors, convulsions, seizures,and amnesia—that have been linked to trauma and nutritional deficiencies.This diversity of forms of shamanistic SoC illustrates the necessity of a neuro-phenomenological approach to examining meditative experience in terms of therelationships of physiological and phenomenological aspects to the intentionalitiesof the practitioners. The differences represented by these three principal SoC reflectstable attractors for our biological capacities associated with the IMC. The differentpatterns of SoC reflect causal sociocultural influences on shamanic potentials asso-ciated with the IMC (Winkelman 1986a&b, 1990, 1992). These include socioeco-nomic conditions: hunting and gathering, agriculture, political integration, andsocial stratification. The physiological and phenomenological features of these dif-ferent SoC are discussed in this chapter to illustrate both the diverse ways in whichthe IMC can be elicited and the phenomenological differences among these SoC.SHAMANIC STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe shaman’s signature alteration of consciousness has been characterized as aflight, soul journey, or OBE. Shamans’ alterations of consciousness may also take132SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"forms other than the soul flight, including a vision quest experience in which oneengages in a variety of austerities to have an experience of an encounter with aspirit power; an animal transformation during which the identity of the practi-tioner becomes that of an animal; a death-and-rebirth experience in which oneengages in a personal experience of death;and other forms of entering intononordinary experiential worlds in which one engages in interaction with spiritentities. These all involve a personal aspect such as a soul or spirit that is believedto have left the body and traveled into other worlds. During the soul journey thepractitioner appears unconscious, but is actively engaged in an experiential realmand these experiences can be recounted on return. Harner (1982) emphasized theshaman’s remembering what happened during the soul journey as a characteristicof the shaman’s SoC. Winkelman’s (1986b, 1992) research supports the conten-tion made by Eliade (1964) that this experience is not one in which the shamanis possessed by spirits, but, rather, one in which the shaman exercises a controlover the spirits. Nonetheless, these spirit entities, especially animal spirits, maybe part of the identity of the person.There are a number of central features of shamanic ritual practices that contrib-ute to the typical features of shamanic SoC. A range of activities and agents used toinduce shamanic SoC shares properties in being related to natural processes andfunctions of the human organism. This point was exemplified in the Chapter 3discussion of the underlying similarities in the structures of NDE and shamanic souljourney. Biological roots are also found in the universals of shamanic percussion andsinging, activities which have deep phylogenetic roots as signaling and communica-tion mechanisms (see Oubre ́[1997]; Wallin, Merker, and Brown [2000]; Randall[2001]). Features of typical shamanic procedures such as overnight rituals alsocontribute to another signature feature of shamanism, the visionary experience.Overnight rituals engage this visionary potential by integrating shamanic activitieswith the dream mode of consciousness, integrating its natural cognitive potentialsinto shamanic SoC. Many shamanic induction procedures reflect ritual efforts tooverride basic biological drives by forcing the body to physical extremes and endur-ing fasting, painful stimuli, and sexual restrictions. Finally, shamanic inductionprocedures involve the ingestion of natural substances known as “psychedelics” thatstimulate integrative visual information processes.Music and DrummingA universal feature of shamanistic healing practices involves singing or chantingand the use of drumming or other percussion instruments. Rhythmic auditorystimulation can impose a pattern on the brain, driving entrainment of both alphaand theta waves (Neher 1961, 1962), with a predominate activation of the EEG(electroencephalogram, the measure of gross brainwave activity) in the thetarange (see Maxfield [1990]; Wright [1991]; also see Maurer, Kumar, Woodside,and Pekala [1997]; Vaitl et al. [2005]). This auditory driving can evoke visual sen-sations of color, pattern, and movement, and even hallucinations, seizures, andemotional and abstract experiences (Neher 1962). Chanting and music-makingTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS133"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"are also capable of evoking a driving response in the brain, producing widespreadEEG coordination in theta and low alpha ranges among the experienced chanters,and dominance in the alpha band for naive listeners; when people listen to musicit has a tendency to evoke slow wave coordination in the EEG (Rogers 1976;Rogers and Walters 1981). The responses to auditory driving parallel those ofphotic driving (flashing lights), which include (1) driving of the brain waves atthe frequency of stimulation; and (2) driving of the brain waves at alpha frequencyregardless of the frequency of stimulation (Vogel, Broverman, Klaiber, and Kun1969).These findings suggested that the cortex is easily set into oscillation at thealpha frequency or slower and that singing, chanting, and percussion proceduresproduce or enhance slow-wave frequencies. Chanting is a vocal communicationsystem that predated speech and functions in enhancing group solidarity by pro-viding information about emotional states to other members of the group. Theevolution of the human singing and musical capacities were clearly central tothe evolution of the shamanic potentials and play a fundamental role in inducingshamanic SoC. Similar effects are also produced by drumming, both of which arefurther discussed in Chapter 6 (also see Randall 2001).Music as an Innate CapacityMusic’s effects on the body reflect information processing distinct from language.Language and music share some brain and body capacities; they nonethelessinvolve capabilities that can be completely dissociated from one another andcan function as autonomous systems (Aniruddh 2003). The modular basis ofmusic processing and the localization of uniquely musical abilities in the righthemisphere (for right-handed nonmusicians) allow its persistence in people forwhom left-hemisphere trauma has interfered with the language capacity (Peretzand Coltheart 2003). The musical capacity preceded language, deriving fromcommon roots with primate vocalizations and their communicative capacity.Music catalyzed brain development, selecting forthose with a greater capacityfor expressive vocalization and its functional roles in group communication(see Brown, Mercer, and Walin [2000]). Music appears to affect emotions in waysthat are transcultural, indicating innate capacities for music processing and per-ception (see Hauser and McDermott [2003]). A multitude of emotional and syn-thetic effects of music reflect its operation on right-hemisphere processes,eliciting its recognized holistic and analogical brain processes and communica-tion with subcortical areas of the brain. These expressive capacities are epito-mized in song as a medium for expression of emotions (Newham 1994).Music and the BrainCrowe (2004) reviewed mechanisms through which music induces physiologicaleffects, with the sound of music imposing a resonant pattern that can elicit a sim-ilar brain wave response across the brain. Crowe reviewed evidence indicating thatthe amygdala and hippocampus of the paleomammalian brain are central to the134SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"effects of music. Sound input to the brain travels from the thalamus to the amyg-dala, carrying input from the reptilian brain and combining it with input fromhigher brain centers. Sound information received by the hypothalamus triggersactivation of the ANS, producing a significant activation of the emotional process-ing centers. The rhythmic properties of music entrain neural oscillations thatsynchronize perception and action to the beat of the music (Janata and Grafton2003). The spatial and temporal sequencing in the information of music has abroader impact on unifying perception, cognition, and behavior, constituting abasic and primordial form of psychointegration (also see Aldridge and Fachner[2005]; and see further discussion of music’s features in Chapter 6).Incorporating “Dreamtime” into ShamanicConsciousnessThe activities and experiences of shamans are explicitly linked to dreams in manygroups; in some cultures shamans are explicitly thought to enter “dreamtime”(e.g., see Elkin [1978]). Dreams have specific physiological effects and functionsthat make them both a specific mode of consciousness, as well as mechanismsfor altering consciousness (Hunt 1995c). This induction process is reflected inthe deliberate use of sleep and dreams in shamanistic ritual in order to induce awarp in consciousness that produces a shift towards the IMC. Sleep involves thebasic shift to parasympathetic dominance and shares characteristics with medita-tive states (Davidson 1976; Schuman 1980). REM sleep (dreaming) has substantialparallels with yogic ecstasy in terms of cortical and visceral arousal, inhibition ofskeletal muscle tone, loss of distinctiveness in the sense of time, vivid perceptualimagery, and parasympathetic dominance (Gellhorn and Kiely 1972). REM sleeppatterns are very similar to the effects of psychedelics in evoking visual imageryand hippocampal-septal slow waves (Mandell 1980); LSD in small doses willevoke REM sleep and dreams (Nichols and Chemel 2006).REM sleep is active or “paradoxical” sleep with desynchronized waves morecharacteristic of waking than deep sleep. In contrast to deep sleep (characterizedby depressed levels of cortical arousal, synchrony of brain waves in the EEG, andcontinued behavioral muscle tone), REM sleep is characterized by higher levels ofCNS arousal, sympathetic system activation, desynchrony of brain waves in theEEG, and loss of muscle tone. REM sleep is an active condition relative to deepsleep, manifested in eye movements and muscle twitches, and, in spite of muscleand reflex inhibition, increases in the rates of respiration, cardiac function, bloodflow, and brain temperature (Pivik 1991). Other features of the dream modeinclude reduced sensory responsiveness and marked alteration of homeostaticcontrol, manifested in skin temperature responding to ambient temperaturerather than being maintained. During late phases of the deep sleep cycle, controlof the autonomic system by the hypothalamus is reduced, allowing for a brainpattern similar to wakefulness. During dream sleep, the nervous system behavesas if it were in a state of continual orientation, but with motor inhibition andsuppression of homeostasis. Similarities of REM sleep physiology to the generalTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS135"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"orientation response include the involvement in the same areas of the brain stemin their initiation; motor paralysis with an activated cortex; hippocampal thetarhythms; and common neural systems involved in their control (Hunt 1989b).REM sleep is like a paralyzed hallucinatory state, with sensorial structures, func-tions, and activities operating according to similar principles during waking anddreaming. This is possible because centers in the lower brain stem inhibit thestriated muscle system, allowing for cognitive and emotional reactions and inten-tional behavior to proceed without movement of the body.Because of these similarities of REM and the IMC, shamans explicitly soughtto integrate dream processes within ritual to induce alterations of consciousness.Peters (1989) proposed that shamanic practices produce an integration of thepotentials of dreaming and waking consciousness. Shamanism achieved this inte-gration through rituals typically lasting throughout the night, which made theintegration of dream cognition with shamanic activities inevitable. The functionalbasis of the use of dreams in shamanism is illustrated by reference to the evolu-tionary and functional roles of dreams, the physiology of dreams, and the natureof dream cognition and experiences.Comparative Perspectives on Sleep and DreamsSleep allows for modulation of the fundamental cycles that synchronize biologicalperiodicity of cells and coordinate physiological adaptations to inner needs(Graham 1990). The physiological patterns of sleep found in humans are sharedwith other animals, reflecting their basic organismic functions. Sleep of a general-ized form is found in fish, amphibians, and reptiles, with a differentiation of sleepinto NREM (nonREM sleep, or deep sleep) and REM (dreams) found in birdsand mammals (Graham 1990). Evolutionary changes in mammals’ brain function,which emerged about 140 million years ago in the ancestor of the marsupial andplacental mammals, provided the basis for the distinctive REM sleep (Winson1985). Both REM and NREM sleep have remarkably similar characteristics acrossmarsupials and mammals, including humans, reflecting the status of deep sleepand dreams as cross-species functional modes of consciousness. The ubiquity ofdream sleep in mammals and the drive to recoup lost dream time reflect the bio-logical basis of this mode of consciousness and its necessity for normal functioning.Winson (1985) suggested that the mammalian adaptations involving extensivelearning created the resultant need for integration of experience over time in orderto guide future behavior. The mammalian adaptation or solution (except formonotremes and echidna) for achieving learning without a large prefrontal cortexwas “off-line processing” or REM sleep, where association of recent memories wasachieved during periods of sleep. This “off-line” processing facilitated use of thefrontal cortex for advanced cognitive and perceptual activities (Winson 1990); suchfunctions of dreams are explicitly sought in the shamanic use of dreams.Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) characterized dreams as the aspectof the unconscious in closest contact with ego awareness and as a manifestationof the operational infrastructure that provides the basis for ego consciousness.Shamanic practices exploit this ritually produced dream access to enter into their136SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"own unconscious infrastructures and those of their patients and to access the spe-cial cognitive capacities of dreams. Given that the dream capacities are basicmammalian adaptations and central to the perspectives of shamanism, they mustbe considered the zone of proximal adaptation for shamanic experiences. Exam-ining the properties of dream cognition helps to illustrate why they are importantin the practices of shamanism, providing access to special forms of experienceand knowledge that reflect the functioning of the presentational symbolic system.Evolutionary Adaptations of DreamingWinson (1985, 1990) suggestedthat REM sleep/dreams and the Freudian unconscious represent a phylogeneticallyancient mechanism in which memories, associations, and strategies are formed,modified, or consulted. This neural system of information processing existed beforerational consciousness arose in humans, involving types of information processingdistinct from the processes of the frontal cortex (Winson 1985, 209). REM sleep isa basic mammalian memory process for evaluating experience and forming strate-gies, reviewing experiences for their transfer from short-term to long-term memory(Graham 1990). The hippocampus and amygdala structures have a fundamentalrole in dreams and memory, providing a core information-processing area forinformation derived from assessment of events and their emotional associations(Winson 1985). Hippocampal theta rhythm (3–6 cps brain waves) is an indicatorof a special type of information processing during which the information from theprimary sensory areas is integrated, processed, and transferred to the neocortex(Winson 1985). Theta activation varies across species, but in each species appearsassociated with behaviors central to species survival. The same neurons performthe task of synchronizing sensory information, species-specific survival activities,and REM sleep. The function of the theta waves in sensory information processingin the lower mammals suggests that a similar process occurs in REM sleep, butwith information input from memory reflecting the processing of previouslyacquired information.Dreaming and waking modes of consciousness are normally exclusive. Ordi-nary dreaming has a distinct neurotransmitter profile from waking consciousness(Hobson 1992). The dream mode has a cessation of serotonin and norepineph-rine activity. The cholinergic system is responsible for the REM sleep inductionand maintenance system, whereas the serotonergic system has an inhibitory orgating role, suppressing intrinsic cholinergic neurons (Hobson 1992). The roleof serotonergic pathways in integrative neuromodulation suggests that the differ-ences in dreams reflect the lack of integrative influences of serotonergic pathwayslinking cognitive appraisal and ego systems.Dream CognitionDream mentation differs from the typical mentation of the waking mode of con-sciousness (Hobson and Stickgold 1994), including cognitive processing andintense imagery and emotions that appear bizarre and delusional from the per-spectives of waking consciousness. The recognized bizarreness of dreams reflectstheir imaginative and creative capacities; they appear illogical from the point ofTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS137"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"view of the waking mode of consciousness because dreams involve a differentsystem of information representation, processing, and consolidation. Althoughthe psychoanalytic perspectives have emphasized the deficient character ofdreams (e.g., repressed desires or compensatory mechanisms), these pathologiza-tion perspectives reflect the monophasic approach of Western culture. Dreamingis a specific type of mentation—the presentational symbolic modality manifested inimagery involving analogic reasoning and organized on the basis of similarity inconfiguration (Hunt 1995a). Although the body remains relaxed, the activity ofthe lower brain suggests the active rehearsal or enactment of customary behav-ioral patterns. Winson (1985, 1990) suggested that so-called dream distortionsinvolve normal associative information processing, interpretation, and integra-tion in the REM mode. Dream condensation is not a disguise or distortion, buta symbol that expresses an unconscious concept for the person. Dreams includestrategies for dealing with the external world that are organized in a way that con-stitutes an “unconscious personality” (Winson 1985, 245). Laughlin, McManus,and d’Aquili (1992) illustrated that dreams subserve the experiential and emo-tional needs of both the conscious and the unconscious personalities. Dreamsinvolve the interaction of the supporting structures of egoic consciousness withstructures disentrained from egoic consciousness, operating independently ofthe environment.Hunt (1989) characterized dreams as involving the presentational symbolicintelligence and engaging abstract cognitive and emotive processes. Dreams sharea core of the presentational symbolic capacity, a cross-modal synesthesia—afusion of visual imagery, spatial information, body expressions, and analogicmetaphors. The predominantly visual (rather than verbal) nature of dreamsreflects this visual-spatial presentational symbolism. Dream imagery constitutesa surface structure expressing meaning of a deeper knowledge base.Evidence that the imagery of dreams is represented in a form distinct fromthat of language is found in the ability of the visual modality of dream imageryto present information not accessible to the linguistic system. This visual-spatialsystem of symbolic presentation is normally inhibited by the dominance of left-hemisphere verbal representational systems; conditions that attenuate the lefthemisphere’s verbal representational systems allow the expression of this presen-tational intelligence.The complexity of information extracted from the dream images attests tothe existence of a separate nonlanguage system of symbolism, construction, andmeaning. The geometric images often found in these states are autosymboliccharacters, an abstract-dynamic geometric imagery that has been considered theroot of thought processes (Arnheim 1969). Hunt suggested that these geometricpatterns manifest transformational operations that constitute the deep structureof an intelligence that operates independently of the linguistic representationalsystems and constitutes “the deep structures of all representational (left hemi-sphere) symbolic intelligence” (Hunt 1989b, 207).Two distinct but interactivecognitive processes are present in dreaming; one, a sequential narrative compo-nent and the other, a visual-spatial component, embodying representationaland presentational symbolism. These are both normally present and in138SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"interaction in the dream processes, but with a relatively greater predominance ofthe right-hemisphere capacities.Many cultures have believed that dreams are a source of creativity and insightthat can be applied to solving everyday problems through accessing informationnot normally available. In contrast, Blagrove (1996) argued that there is a lack ofevidence for claims to these cognitive functions of (ordinary) dreaming. Dreamslack aspects of waking consciousness, such as its self-reflective nature and senseof conscious control, manifested in a lack of single-mindedness and a single the-matic track to dream content. Dreams lack a self-reflective awareness that one isin the dream state. Situations that contradict waking knowledge of the world areaccepted without critical reflection. The dreamer does not appear to have any per-spective, but rather is completely engaged in the dream interaction without wak-ing consciousness’s ability to use reflection. In contrast to the daydreamer’sengagement with fantasy, the REM dreamer usually is not capable of recognizingthe delusional nature of experiences, nor of exercising conscious control or stop-ping to reconsider the possibilities.Nonetheless, dreams can make important contributions to decision making.REM sleep was found to improve creative solutions and, in particular, the inte-gration of unassociated information for the purposes of problem solving (Cai,Mednick, Harrison, Kanady, and Mednick 2009). This advantage of REM for cre-ating problem solutions that is greater than just the passage of time reflects theability of REM sleep to facilitate formation of new nerve connections in the brainand in priming associative processes. REM facilitated development of creativesolutions by the reduction of interference from other thought processes typicalof the waking condition. “REM sleep would allow neocortical structures to reor-ganize associative hierarchies, in which information in the hippocampus wouldbe reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations....We proposethat REM sleep is important for assimilating new information into past experi-ence to create a richer network of associations for future use” (Cai, Mednick,Harrison, Kanady, and Mednick 2009, 10133).Lucid DreamsLucid dreams differ from ordinary dreams in the dreamer’s conscious awarenessof the ongoing dream (Gackenbach and LaBerge 1988; LaBerge 1985). Qualitativedifferences in lucid dreams include possession of waking faculties, such as reason,memory, reflection, and volition. The experiences of lucid dreams are subject todeliberate cultivation, as is evidenced in the reports of yogic traditions (Norbu2002). Hunt (1989b) provided an overview of lucid dreams and related phenom-ena that showed that the physiological, phenomenological, and cognitive aspectsconfirm their nature as spontaneous meditative states. Similarities betweendreams and meditative states are also found in common EEG and autonomicchanges; in increased incidence of lucid dreams among long-term meditators;and in physical detachment, inactive conditions, social withdrawal, and enforcedmotionlessness. Their relationship to shamanic experiences is illustrated in thesimilarities between lucid dreams and out-of-body experiences.THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS139"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Consciousness of oneself dreamingis extremely rare (although cognitivetraining does increase self-reflectiveness during dreams). Recognition of dreaming(lucidity) generally leads to spontaneously awakening upon awareness of the dreamstate. LaBerge (1985) has also pointed to the difficulty of maintaining a sense of con-scious awareness during the dream state even among those who practice luciddreaming. Laberge has pointed out that the lack of intentionality during ordinarydreams is also manifested in lucid dreaming. Rather than intention determininglucid-dream outcomes, it is the power of expectation.This sense that ordinary dreams have of occurring to us in an automatic fash-ion is quite different from what typically occurs during waking consciousness. Thealtered sense of dream self also reflects the lack of frontally based systems of refer-ence from which one ordinarily obtains an additional perspective from which tothink reflexively about one’s self, creating self-consciousness.Although dreams may include material indicating goal-directed action, inten-tionality, or planning, Blagrove (1996) contended that dreams provide a passiverepresentation of such activities: the dream symbolizes waking life’s goal-directedaction rather than an act of engagement typical of waking life. In waking con-sciousness and active daydreaming, we engage in rehearsal, imagining consequen-ces and possible reactions, and exercise a degree of conscious control. Thesecognitive limitations can be reconciled with the widespread anecdotal reports ofinsightful dream cognition and processing by recognizing thatextraordinarydreams, such as those associated with shamanism, have unusual cross-mode inte-grative processing present. These dreams have a special integration between thedream and waking modes of consciousness. Intuitive, archetypal, and other formsof dreams reflecting transpersonal and cross-modal potentials are a consequence ofadditional information provided through limbic-frontal integration. The rarity ofsuch integrative experiences reflects the failure to maintain awareness during thewarps of consciousness in order to transfer (or cross-phase) the contents dreamsto the waking mode of consciousness, particularly in monophasic cultures.Shamanic Ritual and the Dream CapacityShamanic traditions used ritual during the waking mode to modify the dreamexperiences and produce integrative consciousness. Dream incubation andother ritual activities prior to or during sleep enhance cross-modal transfer ofdream cognition back into waking consciousness. These deliberate culturalactivities engage conscious self-awareness within the dream mode to access thepresentational modality in management of emotions and self. Brereton (2000)analyzed adaptive aspects of dreaming in shamanism as involving processes ofscenario construction that provide a risk-free construction and examinationof options. Research on dreams suggests that their content involves a “replaying”of emotionally marked memories that have not been effectively resolved andincorporated into new adaptive behavior patterns. The nonverbal body-basedaspects of dreaming indicate their ability to connect the body-self at a preegoicand prelinguistic level, engaging levels of symbolization that preceded egoicconsciousness.140SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The shamanic ASC also produce forms of self-awareness that transcend theembeddedness of biologically based body consciousness. Shamanic ritual hasthe potential to produce an activation of lucid dreams because REM sleep isenhanced by high levels of physical activity prior to sleep (Laberge and Gakenbach).So, drumming at night engages an enhanced connection with the lucid dream andits cognitive capacities. Lucid dreams engage an interaction between wakingand dream consciousness that can produce cognitive integration and therapeuticoutcomes, reflecting a greater awareness of information-processing capacities ofthe unconscious. Shamanism used dreams to enhance information transfer tothe waking mode to apply it for healing.The normal occurrence of integration of the waking and the dream modes isillustrated in Rossi’s (1986) research on the ultradian rhythms, the approximately90-minute cycles of activation and relaxation that repeat continually, day andnight. The relaxation period of these cycles shows that the information-processing capacities of dreams also occasionally intrude in waking conscious-ness. Rossi suggested that these ultradian rhythms are a psychophysiological basisfor alterations of consciousness, involving the phase of extreme relaxation in theBasic Rest-Activity Cycle. This cycle involves regular fluctuations in brain wavesduring waking consciousness. This involves episodes of external vigilance andmaximal verbal, logical, and analytical mental activity which are followed byperiods of drowsiness, daydreaming, fantasy, and increases in alpha EEG waves.It is during this later phase that the functions of the dream mode of consciousnessintrude on waking consciousness. Underlying the ultradian cycle is the relaxationresponse during which parasympathetic activation is strongest during the wakingmode and facilitates normal penetration of the dream mode of into wakingconsciousness.Inhibition of Natural DrivesProcedures that shamans typically use in preparation for ritual activities includerestrictions on basic natural drives such as desires for sex, food, and water; theseare also shared with the practices used in inducing meditative SoC. In addition toinhibition of these basic drives, shamanic induction procedures also engage inbehaviors called “austerities” that forcibly override natural drives through engag-ing in painful activities. These efforts to override normal adaptive behaviors ofthe organism provoke neurochemical alterations of consciousness. A global effectof these process is the stimulation of the ANS to increase activity in the SNS, lead-ing to a collapse into a PNS-dominant state, as discussed above. A characteristicfeature of shamanic induction procedures involves extreme exertion from hoursof drumming and dancing, an extreme activation of the SNS that eventually leadsto a collapse and the rebound effects induce the parasympathetic-dominant state.Among the procedures that induce this rebound effect are the exhaustive stimu-lation of drumming and dancing, the oxygen depletion of singing and chanting,the effects of painful austerities, and other physically and emotionally exhaustingactivities such as fasting and sleeplessness (see Vaitl et al. 2005).THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS141"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Extreme ExertionExtensive motor behavior (such as dancing), exertion and fatigue can result inslow brain wave activity, hallucinatory experiences, and the release of endogenousopioids.1The effects of motor activity on consciousness are numerous, includingSNS activation, opioid release, and various mystical experiences. Opiates directlyaffect the hypothalamus, producing slow-wave activity, increasing delta and thetabrain waves (Fink 1978). The extreme stimulation of the body by dancing caninduce the release of endogenous opiates because the central opioid systems areactivated by prolonged rhythmic activity and exhaustive anaerobic exercise, withhigh-intensity exercise stimulating the release of opioid peptide beta-endorphins.Exercise can also overwhelm temperature-regulation mechanisms and can causeincreased circulation of endogenous opioids (Appenzeller 1987).Dietrich and McDaniel (2004) integrated a range of research on the relevanceof exercise to the release of the endocannabinoids, the marijuana-like neurotrans-mitters found naturally in our brains. Exercise has a direct effect on the serumconcentrations of the endocannabinoids, likely contributing to the analgesia andsedation, as well as the anxiolysis and sense of well-being, associated with exercise.This exercise-induced ASC involving the endocannabinoid anandamide supple-ments the traditional opioid-mediated effects associated with long-distancerunning.PainA variety of stressful stimuli (burns, extreme cold, pain, injury, and toxic substan-ces) all lead to hypertropic activity of the adrenal cortex and contribute toextreme stimulation of the SNS to the point of collapse and result in a PNS-dominant state. Endorphin release is provoked by diverse trauma and stress.Extremely painful stimuli can result in the direct stimulation of the hypothala-mus and hippocampal-septal area, resulting inthe emergence of synchronizedslow-wave potentials in the EEG. Emotional stress can also provoke the releaseof endogenous opiates and increases in theta activity (Gellhorn 1969). A numberof typical shamanic procedures result in the release of endogenous opiates orendorphins (Prince 1982a). Endorphin levels are highest at night (Henry 1982),a typical time for shamanic activities. Austerities such as self-flagellation, self-inflicted wounds, exposure to temperature extremes, and feats of endurance allresult in the release of endogenous opiates. Exposure to extreme cold can elicitboth opioid and nonopioid pain-inhibitory systems (Bodnar 1990; Kiefel, Paul,and Bodnar 1989).Fasting and Nutritional RestrictionsRestrictions on foods in general, and specific foods such as meats, are typicalpreparations for the shaman. Training of the neophyte typically involves dietaryrestrictions for several weeks to a few months, and may extend for as long as sev-eral years. Fasting induces in the body a hypoglycemic state, which can cause seiz-ures, and increases susceptibility to driving influences on the EEG, reflecting142SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"effects on the pituitary and adrenal glands, which stimulate the hypothalamusand hippocampal-septal systems (Leukel 1972). Kehoe and Giletti (1981) dis-cussed how nutritional deficiencies can contribute to changes in central nervoussystem functioning that induce alterations of consciousness. Diet can affect sero-tonin synthesis, resulting in emotional disturbances, hallucinations, and changesin cognitive and emotional functioning (Gussler 1973). Fessler (2002) illustratedthe effects of semi-starvation in altering consciousness, producing neurotic andhysterical features, dissociation, auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and megalo-mania. Fessler proposed that severe dietary constriction results in an adaptivereduction of serotonin activity which promotes increased risk-taking that couldhave the effect of enhancing survival. Reduced serotonin levels, which are associ-ated with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and self-mutilation,result in enhanced impulsivity. Food deprivation has established effects in pro-ducing depersonalization experiences as well as dissociation, and such nutritionalrestriction may cause sleep disruption due to reduced levels of melatonin precur-sors and serotonin levels and serotonin synthesis (Fessler). These disruptions canproduce the visionary experiences associated with mystical and shamanistic ASC;such dietary deprivations also appear as central mechanisms in the production ofpossession experiences (see below).Sexual AbstinenceSexual abstinence and other sex restrictions are central to shamanic traditions.Cross-culturally, shamans are expected to be celibate before and after their ceremo-nies, a restriction that may be imposed for years during training. Requirements ofcelibacy are often explained in terms of purity and the idea that spirits are attractedto the celibate. There may also be important physiological reasons that have to dowith the physiological dynamics of both sexual orgasm and ecstatic altered statesof consciousness (Davidson 1980). Sexual activity requires a simultaneous increasein the activity of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Whena peak of sexual excitation is achieved, the sympathetic system collapses exhaustedand the parasympathetic state becomes dominant. Shamanic alterations of con-sciousness induce similar patterns of excitation to collapse, a sympathetic activationfollowed by a parasympathetic-dominant state. Prior sexual activity leading to asimilar physiological collapse could preclude the profound parasympathetic col-lapse that typifies shamanic SoC. Sexual prohibitions can be seen as functional infacilitating more powerful ritual ASC.Sensory Deprivation and StimulationSocial isolation, reduction of motor behavior, and muscular relaxation lead to anincrease in cortical synchronization, a greater sensitivity to parasympatheticstimulation, parasympathetic-dominant states with an increase in cortical syn-chronization, and a slowing of the alpha band and emergence of delta waves(Gellhorn 1969; Gellhorn and Kiely 1972). Sensory deprivation and prolongedabsence of environmental stimulation leads to hallucinatory experiences,THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS143"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"resulting from a loss of serotonin inhibition similar to the interference of psyche-delics in serotonin synthesis and release (Mandell 1980). Extensive, prolonged,and intense sensory stimulation can lead to the same effects as sensory depriva-tion through habituation and the complete blockage of perception of stimuli,leading to a profound alteration of consciousness.“Sacred Medicines”: The Hallucinogens asPsychointegratorsA wide variety of psychoactive plant substances are used in shamanistic traditions(e.g., see Dobkin de Rios [1984]; Furst [1976]; Ra ̈tsch [2005]; Schultes andHofmann [1979]; Winkelman and Andritzky [1996]). The major classes of hallu-cinogens are (1) tryptamines (LSD, DMT, psilocin, and psilocybin) and (2) phe-nylethylamines (e.g., mescaline) (Fantegrossi, Mernane, and Reissig 2008;Nichols 2004). While the tryptamines are similar in chemical structure to theneurotransmitter serotonin, the phenylethylamines are not; but, nonetheless,they exert similar influences on target neurons (Nichols and Chemel 2006). Theexperiential effects of the indoleamines, tryptamines and phenylethylamines, are“virtually identical” (Aghajanian and Marek 1999, 20S), and the basic similarityin their biological effects is illustrated by a partial cross-tolerance across LSD,mescaline, and psilocybin (see Passie et al. 2008 for review). Although character-ized by a number of different chemical structures and modes of action, thesubstances classified as hallucinogens produce common physiological effects.While they likely affect most neurotransmitter systems directly or indirectly, sincethe 1960s their principal effects have been recognized as derived from their inter-action with the serotonergic neurotransmitter system. Their effects derive fromboth general aspects of altering consciousness, as well as from specific mecha-nisms related to effects on serotonin. Common general effects include productionof high-voltage slow-wave synchronous brain wave activity in the hippocampus,synchronizing the frontal cortex and inducing a parasympathetic dominant state(Mandell 1980).Hallucinogens as PsychointegratorsThe principal effect of these substances’ interaction with the serotonergic systemis to disinhibit the brain stem and limbic structures, resulting in enhanced infor-mation inflow, emotional lability, increased visual experiences, and synchronousbrain discharges. Releasing the inhibitory effects of serotonin results in synchro-nous discharges in the temporal lobe limbic structures, inhibition of raphe cellregulation of the visual cortex, and, consequently, to hyperactivity of the visualregions (Mandell 1980). It is likely that all hallucinogens, known as such for theireffects in producing the vision experience, have similar physiological effects inproducing a state of hippocampal-septal slow-wave dominance, although theymay act through different mechanisms. Passie et al. (2008, 305) summarized theresearch as generally indicating that “LSD acts to preferentially inhibit serotonergic144SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"cell firing while sparing post-synaptic serotonergic receptors from upregulation/downregulation.” “The major hallucinogens appear to activate the right hemi-sphere, influence thalamic functioning, and increase metabolism in paralimbicstructures and in the frontal cortex” (Passie et al. 2008, 305).To better conceptualize the effects of these substances, we need to reject themisconceptions implied by “hallucinogen.” Winkelman (1996, 2001a, 2007a)proposed the termpsychointegratorbased on a synthesis of (1) the patterns ofeffects revealed in cross-cultural studies of traditions using these substances;and (2) neurobiological research on the mechanisms of action of LSD on theserotonergic system. The term psychointegrator reflects both the neurologicaland experiential effects of these substances, a neurophenomenological perspec-tive that explains the cross-cultural similarities in perceptions regarding theeffects of these substances. Psychointegration reflects the often-noted propertiesof these substances of engaging both mental and emotional processes in adynamic integration that leads the user towards an integrative holistic growthexperience (Grof 1975, 1980, 1992). The term psychointegrator incorporates theroot “psyche,” whose referents include mind, soul, and spirit; psychointegratorreflects the stimulation of the mind, emotions, soul, and spirit to integrativedevelopment.The concept of psychointegration reflects similar effects of the serotoninsystem, which has multiple roles reflected in its special characterization as “neuro-modulator,” regulating the balance among many neurotransmitter systems.Understanding the normal functions of that serotonin system and how they arealtered by the psychointegrators helps explain their effects. The roles of thesesubstances in the alterations of consciousness include their general effects ininhibiting the serotonergic system and blocking its general roles in inhibitingspecific aspects of brain functioning related to dopamine. Previc (2009) proposesthat the psychedelics reverse the dopamine suppression effects characteristic ofserotonin, allowing a greater dopaminergic activity.The information summarized below2illustrates that the psychointegrators’primary effects are reflected in synchronized hyperactivity across the neuraxis,the main nerve bundle linking the structural levels of the brain from the brainstem to the frontal cortex (Role and Kelly 1991). These processes of psychointe-gration are manifested in the theta wave discharges that produce a synchroniza-tion of brain waves across the levels of the brain. Psychointegration is alsomanifested in psychological experiences, particularly those related to healing(wholeness) and the sense of interconnectedness (e.g., cosmic consciousness andother transpersonal experiences). This model of psychointegration is illustratedin Vollenweider’s (1998) research on psychedelics, which illustrates their effectson the cortico-striato-thalamocortical loops, which link the sensory gating sys-tems of the lower brain structures with the receptor systems of the frontal brain.The psychointegrators’ interruption of the CSTC loops undermines the thalamicareas’ ability to screen out information, leading to a flood of information on theascending levels of the brain. The primary inhibitory role of serotonin is releasedby the net effects of LSD-like psychointegrators.THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS145"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Serotonin as a NeuromodulatorSerotonin is a monamine neurotransmitter, whose projections primarily origi-nate in the lower brain structures (especially the raphe nuclei of the upper brainstem), from which they project upward to the locus coeruleus and many otherregions of the brain (Nichols and Chemel 2006). These locus coeruleus neuronsextend to a wide range of ascending targets in the paleomammalian brain (hypo-thalamus, hippocampus) and frontal cortex (Passie et al.). Their long, highlybranched axons, slow latency and conduction, and diffuse projections to manyterminal fields enable serotonin to operate more as a modulator than as a classicsynaptic transmitter. Their projections extend from the brain stem area (locuscoeruleus and raphe nuclei) to virtually allareas of the brain, where impulsesoriginating in a few neurons eventually reach hundreds of thousands of otherneurons. Modulatory neurotransmitters are unconventional in the sense thatthey modulate the effects of other neurotransmitter systems, even affecting nerveterminals and blood vessels that do not have serotonergic innervations (Krukand Pycock 1991; Ribeiro 1991). There are different kinds of serotonin (5-HT)receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) with different effects on andkinds of interactions with psychointegrators in different parts of the brain (seeAghajanian 1994; Aghajanian and Marek 1999; Nichols 2004; Passie et al. 2008;Ribeiro 1991).Serotonin acts as a modulator across all levels of the brain, from the brainstem and limbic system to the frontal cortex. Serotonin is the most extensivemonoaminergic neurotransmitter system in the brain, a key neurotransmitterwith a wide range of functions in sensory processing and perception, motor activ-ity and behavior, hunger and feeding, thermoregulation and pain, release ofgrowth hormones, sleep cycles, learning and memory, moods, and modulatingthe sympathetic nervous system (see Kruk andPycock 1991, 122–23; Role andKelly 1991). The central importance of serotonin as a modulator means its overalleffects are in determining the strength of the responses of the postsynaptic cells inresponse to changing levels of arousal or motivation of the organism. The highestrates of firing of 5-HT neurons are during active waking periods, with theiractivity undergoing progressively greater reduction during quiet waking andslow-wave sleep; 5-HT firing virtually ceases during REM sleep.There is a wide range of areas of the CNS that are affected by 5-HT. The neu-rons are concentrated along the midline area and the raphe nuclei in the brainstem, from which they project upward into the limbic system and frontal cortex.The primary projections are ascending, with a widespread distribution through-out the neuraxis and diffuse influences over vast neuronal populations. Serotoninneurons are found primarily in the raphe nuclei, from which they project upwardinto the anterior hypothalamus and thalamus; the limbic system, particularly theamygdala, hippocampus, and limbic forebrain; and the corpus striatum, basalganglia, and the frontal cortex, particularly the visual and auditory areas. Thesestructures are directly responsible for a range of human capabilities central toconsciousness: attention, alertness, and maintenance of waking/sleep cycles;control of organismic processes through regulation of the autonomic nervous146SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"system; integration of emotional and motivational processes; synthesis of infor-mation from the entire brain; and visual conceptualization and representation.A central feature of serotonergic systemic function involves an inhibitoryfunction, repressing activity. The functions of the serotonergic system relate toMacLean’s model of the evolution of the brain, functioning as the most centraland powerful system of integration and coordination among the three brainsubsystems. In the reptilian part of the brain, serotonin functions as a regulatorsystem within the R-complex. Serotonergic functions in the paleomammalianbrain involve control over the R-complex, inhibiting limbic brain emotionalfunctions, and distribution of information through connections with the pre-frontal and neocortex. Psychointegrators stimulate this serotonergic system butalso produce other effects thatenhance paleomammalian brain functions byinhibiting some of the effects of serotonin.Psychointegrators’ Effects on SerotoninPsychointegrators’ effects on serotonin provide the principal mechanisms of theireffects and therapeutic applications. Psychointegrators exercise both inhibitory/blocking (antagonist) and excitatory/facilitating (agonist) effects in their interactionwith the serotonergic system. While showing an affinity (binding capacity) for theserotonin receptors, they are activating at some receptor sites acting as agonists,while at other sites, functioning as antagonists (or blockers), which prevent thenormal responses of receptors (Kruk and Pycock 1991; Passie et al. 2008). LSD hasa net effect of a serotonin agonist, acting at postsynaptic sites in inhibiting serotoninrelease while simultaneously increasing serotonin retention (Passie et al.).Knowledge of the mechanisms of psychointegrators is primarily based onlaboratory and clinical studies of LSD in rats (Nichols 2004). Therefore, theremust be qualifications regarding the findings, especially if they do not correspondto phenomenological and experiential dynamics in humans. Nonetheless, gener-alizations to the broader group of psychointegrators other than just LSD are sub-stantiated by the partial cross-tolerance among the substances known ashallucinogens and psychedelics (e.g., indoleamines like psilocybin and LSD;harmine and harmaline found in the genusBanisteriopsis; DMT [dimethyltrypt-amine]; and the phenethylamines such as mescaline (Passie et al.). The effects ofthe psychointegrators on the brain are more complex than just serotonin; theyare reflective of the many compounds found in a single plant and the diversetypes of serotonin receptors in the brain. The serotonin model is not exhaustive,however, as there are also significant effects of the psychointegrators on otherneurotransmitter systems, because LSD also binds with dopamine and adrenergicreceptors. Furthermore, there are muscarine- and nicotine-related substances andothers which are not addressed here.Psychointegrator Effects on Select Serotonin NeuronsPassie et al. (2008) reviewed animal research indicating that the highest levels ofabsorption of the psychedelics are in the basal ganglia and thalamus (reptilian brainarea); the hippocampus and hypothalamus (paleomammalian brain); and theTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS147"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"pituitary and pineal glands and visual and auditory areas (frontal cortex). Primaryeffects of LSD-like psychointegrators are through the action on the 5-HT1Aand5-HT2serotonergic neurons, where they are partial agonists (Passie et al.).3Whilethere is also binding with the 5-HT3,5-HT5and 5-HT7receptors (Vollenweider1998; Nichols 2004), indoleamine and phenethylamines cause greater activation of5-HT2serotonin receptors relative to other serotonin receptors (Aghajanian 1994).LSD appears to act on the 5-HT1Areceptors in the raphe nucleus and locuscoeruleus as an agonist, with a neteffect of inhibiting the firing and release ofserotonin cells (Passie et al. 2008). However, this interpretation is questioned bysome (Fantegrossi, Mernane, and Reissig 2008; Nichols 2004). The 5-HT1Arecep-tors in the raphe nuclei mediate collateral inhibition of the raphe system and areaffected by LSD-like indoleamines as powerfulagonists, inhibiting serotoninreceptor firing (Aghajanian 1994, 140). A consequence of this suppression ofraphe cell firing is an increased excitability of the cortical pyramidal cells, whichmakes them more sensitive to the psychointegrator-induced activation of the5-HT2acells (Nichols and Chemel 2006).The principal effects of LSD-like psychointegrators, however, are thought toresult from their high affinity for 5-HT2receptors, where they function as partialagonists (Aghajanian and Marek 1999; Nichols 2004; Passie et al. 2008). 5-HT2Aactivation increases cortical glutamate levels, as well as its effects on the dopaminesystem as both an agonist and antagonist. The 5-HT2receptors found on postsynap-tic neurons mediate LSD effects on the cerebral cortex, on the locus coeruleus, andon other areas of the brain (Aghajanian 1994). LSD affinity for 5-HT2Aand 5-HT2creceptors facilitates the functioning of the locus coeruleus, which receives numeroussomatosensory and visceral inputs and projects diffusely to most of the brain (Millerand Gold 1993). Large concentrations of serotonin 5-HT2receptors are found in thelimbic system in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia, where sensory-processingfunctions are antagonized by LSD (Kruk and Pycock 1991). LSD has effects in thehippocampus by blocking or suppressing the typical depressant functions of sero-tonin, permitting the release of responses similar to dreaming and contributing toproduction of the typical visual experiences by disinhibiting postsynaptic neuronsin the limbic and visual areas.Aghajanian and Marek (1999) summarized evidence for significant LSDeffects in enhancing the excitatory post synaptic potentials of glutamate withinthe cortex (also see Nichols and Chemel 2006). Glutamate is an excitatory neuro-transmitter and its activation increases the sensitivity of the cells of frontal cortex;the effects of the psychointegrators are to increase the cells’ action potentials(Nichols and Chemel 2006). Aghajanian and Merek note that one of the effectsof these substances is making the neurons more sensitive to incoming signals bydecreasing the threshold for excitation and consequently affecting high-levelprocessing in perceptual, affective, and cognitive systems.Systemic Effects of PsychointegratorsA model of common neurobiochemical pathways involving diverse agents andactivities that produce transcendental experiences was proposed by Mandell148SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"(1980, 1985) as based in a biogenic amine-temporal lobe interaction manifestedin high-voltage slow-wave EEG activity originating in the hippocampal-septalarea of the limbic system. This limbic system discharge pattern produces strongtheta wave discharges. These theta wave discharges ascend the neuraxis, eventu-ally producing an integration of lower brain processes in the frontal cortex, aphysiological synthesis or integration of the behavioral, emotional, and cognitivelevels of the brain. This produces enhanced coordination across the levels of thebrain. This is reflected in several patterns: a general increase in the coherence ofthe brain waves; synchronization across the neuraxis; and interhemisphericsynchronization of the two halves (left brain-right brain) of the frontal cortex(Mandell 1985).Psychointegrators exert systemic effects by affecting activity of several keyareas of the brain:1. Reptilian brain: the raphe and reticular formations and thalamic structuresof the brain stem area that control the amount of information the higherlevels of the brain receive;2. Paleomammalian brain: the limbic system, particularly the hippocampusand amygdala, which provides emotional information and personal memo-ries and sense of self; and3. Neocortex: the visual and auditory areas of the frontal cortex.Psychointegrative effects are derived in part from action in blocking serotoner-gic inhibitory action in the lower brain systems. Serotonin inhibits firing in theraphe area and depresses neuronal firing in lower areas of the brain. LSD-like psy-chointegrators act on the serotonergic neurons in the locus coeruleus to reduce thisinhibition. The locus coeruleus is a nodal point for convergence of somatosensoryand visceral information and innervates most areas of the neuraxis, principally,the thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, basal forebrain, hippocampus, andneocortex. At lower dosages psychointegrators can increase arousal, heighteningsensory receptivity and responsiveness to the environment. This is a reflection ofthe release of the screening mechanisms of the lower brain, allowing into conscious-ness the vast array of stimuli that are habitually screened out through habituation.The enhanced amount of information, combined with the blockage of some seroto-nergic circuitry by the psychointegrators, contributes to reduced or reversedhabituation of typical response patterns and new patterns of behavior.LSD’s inhibitory effects on serotonin autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei alsoproduce a disinhibition of higher brain targets. The release of the tonic inhibitoryserotonin effects increases activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus and amygdala,enhancing emotional processing. LSD-like psychointegrators also potentiate sero-tonin’s excitatory effects on brain stem and spinal cord areas where serotonergicinput results in excitatory effects on the cerebral cortex and brain stem. Nicholsand Chemel (25, 26) concluded that these substances amplify incoming stimuliand “greatly enhance the sensitivity and excitability of cortical processing...butreceiving data only from limbic structures, memory stores, and phylogenetic oldbrain structures.”THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS149"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Psychointegrators disinhibit the mesolimbic temporal lobe structures,reversing the habitual effect of serotonin in depressing the action of target neu-rons in the forebrain and releasing the visual representation processes manifestedas visions. The most intense disinhibition and, therefore, greatest release of activ-ity is on the limbic system’s emotional-processing areas and the visual areas ofthe cortex, resulting in intense visual and emotional experiences. This disinhibi-tion of the mesolimbic temporal lobe structures is manifested in a key feature ofpsychointegrator-induced changes in overall brain organization—high-voltagesynchronous activity in the hippocampus and synchronous discharges in the tem-poral lobe limbic structures manifested in synchronous theta range (3–6 cps)brain wave patterns. These theta waves are propagated up the neuraxis of the brain,driving impulses into the frontal cortex where these slower, more coherent, wavepatterns replace the normal desynchronized fast-wave activity characteristic of thefrontal cortex.The limbic-frontal driving elevates information from the behavioral and emo-tional brains, integrating unconscious material into consciousness. This resultsin an integration of feelings with thoughts, enhancing integration and insight.Mandell (1985) suggested that cognitive effects also are derived from improvinginformation exchange between the two hemispheres and their specialized func-tions in cognition and affect, producing interhemispheric coherence and fusionthat results in insight. These synchronizing effects in the brain are the neurologi-cal causes of the integrative experiences of psychointegrators, their potential toproduce experiences of connection, understanding, and oneness. Psychointegra-tors stimulate the brain to process information in this integrated fashion. Thesecombined effects of psychointegrators on the various serotonergic regions of thebrain result in the increase in information from the environment, body, andmemory; the enhanced experience and recall of emotions; the stimulation of basicmotivations and cognitive processes; and increases in awareness and internalattention. These diverse effects result in synthesis of information from the entirebrain, enhancing the integration of emotions and other aspects of the archetypalpsyche in visual representations.Vollenweider’s (1998; Vollenweider and Geyer 2001) research ilustrated thatthese effects derive from actions on the principal organizational networks of thebrain, the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) feedback loops. These loopsare regulated at lower levels of the brain in the thalamus, which limit the ascendinginformation; psychedelics disrupt this serotonin regulation and functioning as a“gatekeeper” filtering information from the environment and body. Releasingthese regulatory systems can flood the frontal cortex with information, leading tobreakdown of the integrative capacity of the ego with an overload of information,resulting in a breakdown of the ego structures, a contributory factor in inductionof shamanic and mystical experiences.Psychointegrators and ConsciousnessThe overall blocking effect of psychointegrators on serotonin neurons results in adisinhibition of their typical repression. The areas with the densest serotonin axon150SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"terminals—the limbic system’s emotional processing areas and the visual areas ofthe cortex—have the most intense disinhibition and, therefore, the greatesteffects, exemplified in the typical visual and emotional experiences. Releasinginhibition of the visual cortex gives rise to the visual hyperactivity called visionsor hallucinations. The limbic system’s control of the hippocampus, a link betweenthe reptilian brain and the frontal cortex, suggests heightened integration of hier-archically ordered brain functions. Psychointegrators primarily activate the paleo-mammalian brain and its functions, evoking and processing important emotionsand memories. Psychointegrators also stimulate the R-complex, maintainingalertness and awareness, interfering with routinized (habituated) behavioral rou-tines, and providing an enhanced integration of information. The reptilian andpaleomammalian brain’s information-processing modalities involve cognitiveprocesses that play a predominant role in managing emotional and social life,providing mechanisms for shamanistic healing.Consciousness is based on the integration of the left hemisphere’s objectifyingactivities; the right hemisphere’s integration, interpretation, and pattern con-struction; and the paleomammalian brain’s evaluative functions and social-empathic responses, integrated withR-complex-based behavioral routines.Human behavior requires the coordination of information with motivationsand personal significance, a linking together of emotions and the cognitive andrational faculties. Psychointegrators enhance information integration across theneuraxis, enhancing information integration, particularly with respect to attach-ments, emotions, and the role of social “others” in our lives. The antagonism ofdopamine in the R-complex by serotonergic psychointegrators suggests anothereffect of psychointegrators is to shut down the habitual routines related to socialbehavioral displays. This has the effect of forcing the frontal cortex to consciouslyprocess information that has been relegated or automatized by the R-complex andpaleomammalian brain.Summary of Shamanic ASC Induction PracticesThe diverse activities used by shamanic practitioners to induce alterations of con-sciousness have numerous effects on the brain and nervous system. Among themost significant effects are activities and agents that stimulate the major neuro-transmitter systems, specifically, the serotonin, opioid and endocannabinoidsystems. Secondary consequences of these stimulations include effects on bothdopamine and the excitatory glutaminergic systems. General effects of shamanicinduction processes increase the availability of these neurotransmitters. Theirnet effects enhance the transmission of ascending information in the brain, typi-fied in coherent theta wave discharges and the experience of a visual panorama,exemplified in dreaming, hallucinations, and visionary experience.MEDITATIVE STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSMeditative traditions are primarily associated with religious traditions of Asia (e.g.,Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism), but similar esoteric practices are also found in earlyTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS151"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Christian, Islamic, and Judaic religions. Nonreligious traditions of contemplationfurther illustrate the diversity of meditative traditions. While the contemporarymeditative traditions emerged some three thousand years ago, there are direct con-tinuities of the meditative traditions with shamanic roots, as was illustrated inChapter 2 with linguistic, mythological, and historical data.Meditation is generally understood as a practice of exercises in which the focusof attention or awareness is developed in order to cultivate personal consciousnessand acquire greater spiritual insight.Shapiro (1990) and Walsh (1983) offeredsimilar perspectives that emphasize that meditation involves a range of practices,a family of techniques. These have a common concern with the conscious trainingof attention in order to heighten nonanalytical awareness and develop greatervoluntary control over mental processes. Enhanced attention and control contributeto development of insight into the nature of mind, personal identity, and con-sciousness, providing a sense of alignment and harmony with the deepest wisdomof the universe. This perception of reality reveals an interconnectedness of theentire universe and contributes to alterations of consciousness that can inspirelifestyle and behavioral changes that provide psychotherapeutic and psycho-physiological benefits.What characterize meditative traditions, East and West, are concerns withthe interaction of spirituality and consciousness and the development of self-awareness in the evolution of more advanced forms of consciousness. Meditationpractices are also found outside of religious traditions in secular meditationactivities (e.g., Transcendental Meditation) (West 1987a), but even there we seea persistent core involving the intersection of spirit, self, and evolution.Underlying the diversity of meditative practices and traditions are funda-mental commonalities, such as agreements about the nature, processes, andstages of development of consciousness, that reflect neurognostic structures. Thisis exemplified in EEG research on various meditative traditions which illustratesthat physiological parameters coincide with phenomenological descriptions ofmeditative conditions—greater attention, focus, coordination, integration, andinsight. This section examines commonalities in meditation practices in termsof the processes of contemplative development; the brain patterns of meditation;the development of attention; the constructed nature of perception; the develop-ment of new senses of self and identity; and views of the levels of consciousness.The different senses of self are examined as a basis for constructing a neurologi-cally based epistemological system to characterize various meditative SoC withinthe integrative mode of consciousness.Neurophenomenological Perspectiveson Meditative CommonalitiesInvestigators of diverse meditation traditions have concluded that underlying thevariety of cultural forms are common objectives, practices, processes, and stages ofdevelopment (see Wilber [1977, 1980]). These commonalties constitute a “peren-nial psychology” (Wilber1977) and “perennial philosophy,” a universal set of152SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"beliefs about human nature and consciousness found in mystical traditions aroundthe world (Smith 1975, 2000). This consensus about the nature of consciousness,the functions of the human mind, the mind’s construction of reality, and the vary-ing forms of consciousness reflect an empirical understanding of consciousness.The consciousness disciplines (Walsh 1980), Asian psychologies (Walsh 1988),and contemplative traditions (Laughlin et al. 1992) emphasize an examination ofthe nature of human consciousness and its operations through “state specificsciences of consciousness” (Tart 1972). Their focus on observation of subjective,or internal, experience and on reporting on its processes provides a basis for under-standing consciousness.These meditative traditions involve an examination of the relationshipbetween the knower and the phenomena known through transcendental inquiry(Wilber 1979). This inquiry and validation are based on the mental processesof (1) injunction to proceed in certain ways to produce observable experiences;(2) the experience, apprehensions, and observations; and (3) the subsequentmental and social verification or confirmation of the experience. The verificationprocess occurs in a different mode and epistemic structure than does the observa-tion, with language and social norms employed to verify perceptions derivedfrom experiences that are transrational and transverbal.Laughlin et al. (1992) characterized contemplative development as involvingmaturational processes that reflect the development of structural features ofhuman neurophysiology through the conscious application of the individual tohis or her own development. They characterized these developments as relativelyrare because they require both considerable effort and the supportive social insti-tutions and “technologies” to transform the relation of the physical substratumwith the mental realm. The symbolic reorganization of the functioning of theneurobiological systems derives from the role of symbols in communicationbetween the conscious and the unconscious aspects of the nervous system andfrom the ritual manipulation of neurognostic structures to activate specific pat-terns of response within the nervous system. The universal features of meditativetraditions reflect a conscious engagement with neurognostic structures mani-fested in attentional, perceptual, and conceptual processes, and through thisexamination, development of the abilityto control physiological responses,including EEG, respiration, pain, oxygen consumption, and bleeding (see Taylor,Donovon, and Murphy [1997] for review).Meditation and the BrainDifferent disciplines may produce different autonomic conditions and psycho-physiological responses to stimuli while in meditative SoC (e.g., see Kasamatsuand Hirai 1966; Anand, China, and Singh 1961). Nonetheless, there appear tobe fundamental physiological similarities across disciplines: a shift toward para-sympathetic dominance (e.g., reductions in cortical arousal, in muscle tension,in skin conductance, in cardiac function, and in respiration rate); an overalldecrease in frequency of the brain wave pattern to alpha and theta ranges; andan increase in alpha and theta amplitude and regularity in the frontal and centralTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS153"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"regions of the brain (Davidson 1976; Kasamatsu and Hirai 1966; Gellhorn andKiely 1972; Taylor, Murphy, and Donovan 1997; Wallace and Benson 1972).This early evidence—that meditation leads to an increase in slow-wave brainpatterns—continues to be confirmed: typical changes in brain waves involve anincrease in alpha waves, which then decrease in frequency toward dominant thetarhythms. Takahashi et al. (2005) found that meditation was associated with signifi-cant increases in fast theta power and slow alpha power, principally in the frontalarea. Cahn and Polich (2006) reviewed a wide range of studies confirming enhancedalpha and theta in meditators, as well as increased EEG coherence (the cross-correlation in the power of a frequency band across different cortical areas). EEGmeasures show that the overall levels of theta and alpha activation reflected profi-ciency in meditation practice. The alpha enhancement involves both trait and stateEEG measures, including alpha slowing that is interpreted as evidence of enhancedtheta activity and power, a trait frequently found with advanced meditators. Thistheta is manifested as “increases in frontal midline theta power,” which is associatedwith an increase in attention as well as reduction in anxiety. Takahashi et al. foundincreases in fast theta power of the frontal lobes to reflect enhanced mindfulnessand harm avoidance. They proposed that this reflects aspects of meditationenhancement of two major mind factors, internalized attention and mindfulness.These associations of meditation with alpha and theta EEG have stood thetest of time and are supplemented by more recent research that also implicatesan additional level of meditation-induced EEG: biphasic hypersynchronoushigh-frequency gamma waves (35–44 cps; see Lehmann et al. [2001]; Lutz et al.[2004], Vialatte et al. [2009]). The presence of gamma is very significant for themodel of the IMC because gamma is associated with binding of diverse signalswithin the brain. The gamma waves have a significant implication for the generalhypothesis of the IMC because gamma is associated with the same principle asintegration in its roles in binding activities from diverse areas of the brain. Thesegamma findings do not contradict,but rather strengthen, the theta-wave psy-chointegration model of the IMC. “The strength of gamma-band synchroniza-tion is modulated with the phase of lower-frequency rhythms, particularly thetheta rhythm...and the alpha rhythm” (Fries 2009, 217). Advanced meditatorsalso have an increased gamma to theta ratio in comparison to novices. Hebertet al. (2005) implicated alpha EEG during meditation as a form of “informationtransfer and integration in the brain that leads to high-level cognitive processes.”They proposed that the enhanced alpha frequency phase synchrony that occursduring meditation may have effects of improving functional integration andmind-body health. These are the same basic systemic physiological changes asso-ciated with the IMC—a parasympathetic dominant state with enhanced thetabrain waves and systemic neural integration.Meditation is not primarily a right-hemisphere experience, although it doesinvolve a relative shift toward right-hemisphere mentation as habitual left-hemisphere activities (language, logic, etc.) are deliberately attenuated. It is notthe frontal hemispheres, but the lower paleomammalian brain that is the focusof meditative activity. Meditation’s overall pattern of enhanced interhemisphericsynchronization reflects activation of attentional processes of the lower brain154SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"structures (Delmonte 1987a; Stroebel and Glueck 1980). Fenwick (1987, 109)noted this dominance of the discharges of lower brain structures and a “synchro-nization and spreading out of spindling within the thalamic structures, thus caus-ing an increased similarity of spectral frequencies in different cortical areas.” Thephysiological findings of increased interhemispheric synchronization, a relativedecline in left-hemisphere activation, and greater coherence or integration acrosscortical areas are consistent with what the contemplative disciplines themselvesconsider to be the consequences of meditation on the functioning of the humanmind and consciousness. Increased theta activity as a function of a meditator’scompetence substantiates attentional development because the sustained low-amplitude theta is associated with sustained attention. These neurophenomeno-logical correspondences illustrate the importance of seeking the concordancebetween physical and phenomenological data. Commonalities across meditativetraditions that reflect these neurological processes include the nature of atten-tional processes; the operation of perception; the nature of human identity andself; and the different forms or levels of consciousness and their characteristics.AttentionMeditative traditions retrain attention to enhance awareness and the ability toconcentrate and focus attention for an extended period of time (Odajnyk 1993;Taylor et al. 1997). Meditation enhances preattentive processes, visual imageryability, and internal locus of control. Enhanced attention results in an increasedawareness of unconscious mental processes and in insight into the nature of mentaloperations. A common point of meditative traditions is that most human behav-ior is mindless and unconscious, a kind of culturally induced hypnosis in whichpeople habitually identify with their ego, thoughts, and behaviors (Walsh 1983).The development of attention permits enhancement of awareness through disi-dentification with one’s mental content. When concentration becomes habitualand automatized, it creates a complex that enables an autonomous and perma-nent process of meditation, enhancing all levels of awareness. Changes in atten-tional processing reverse habituation, increase perceptual awareness, and lead to areduction in habituation to external stimuli. Deautomatization and interferencewith the automatization process free up mental energy.Meditation literature (e.g., Goleman [1977]; Ornstein [1972]; Shapiro [1990];Walsh [1983]) indicates two principal attentional strategies. The primary differ-ences contrast (1) awareness, mindfulness, or insight meditation, characterized bya focus on the field or on the contents of mind, consciousness, or awareness; and(2) concentrative meditation, characterized by a development of focus of attentionon a specific object or activity (e.g., breathing). Castillo (1991) described threestages in the development of attention in meditation in the Yoga Sutras: (1)dharana(fixed attention); (2)dhyana(continuous attention); and (3)samadhi(coalescentattention). Fixed attention, holding the attention of personal consciousness on aspecific object of meditation, is followed by continuous attention, the holding ofattention on the object of fixed attention without a sense of self-consciousness. Coa-lescent attention becomes so concentrated that all awareness of the external world isTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS155"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"lost, resulting in the experience of void or nothingness, in which all that exists forthe meditator is attention.Perception and Presentational IntelligenceMeditation involves the analysis and understanding of perception, developing anawareness of the habitual perceptual and cognitive processes, which leads to a ces-sation of the ordinary unconscious projective and associative processes (Claxton1987a, Delmonte 1987b; Odajnyk 1993). Concentrative meditation techniquesconstrict the perceptual field to facilitate recognition of the constructed natureof perception. Awareness of the construction of perception and experience pro-vides a basis for questioning ordinary perceptions as inaccurate assumptions. Thisawareness leads to the realization that the objects of the world of perception arederived from one’s mental models. Meditative practices inhibit “all four psycho-logical functions—sensation, thinking,feeling, and intuition” (Odajnyk 1993,57). With the deautomization of the cognitive constructs habitually employed,one is then capable of observing them and enhancing awareness of nonverbal,somatic, and imagetic processes.Hunt (1995a&b&c) characterized meditative traditions as constructing systemsof knowledge from microgenetic imagetic features of biologically based perceptualand conceptual systems. Contemplative traditions involve cognitive processes basedin presentational states “understood as a reconstitution on the level of symboliccognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sen-tient creatures” (Hunt 1995c, 220). Hunt suggested that the experiences of medita-tive states of consciousness involve the structures of presentational symboliccognition and are derived from basic structures of perception. Mystical experiencesinvolve the microgenetic iconic stages of perception, geometric perceptual patternsthat provide the basis for the more complex and abstract mental processes throughcross-modal synesthesia.The neurophysiological basis of these perceptions is indicated by the commonforms and experiences reported by contemplatives cross-culturally. These structuresare given cultural explanation, but they reflect an immediate perception of sensoryevents before interpretation, experiences that are universal because of their neurog-nostic basis. They provide a metaphoric vehicle for meaning based on their use in“an abstract presentational metaphor also based on cross-modal synesthetic transla-tion” (Hunt 1989, 191). These experiences include the “white light experiences” andthe imagined body that are widely reported in mystic and shamanic traditions. Huntcharacterized the “light-of-the-void” experience, a luminescent glow, as the mostbasic quality of the visual system and, through cross-modal translation, a metaphorfor openness. The meditative traditions use these metaphors for expressing knowl-edge of consciousness itself, as embodied in the concept of “enlightenment.” Lightas the most basic quale provides an inclusive metaphor for the totality of conscious-ness, epitomized in the metaphors of enlightenment and illumination.The synesthesias involved in the translations between different sensory modal-ities provide a basis for symbolic meanings. These meanings are felt meanings pro-duced by transformations between the information regarding the body image and156SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"the visual field (Hunt 1995b, 157). Vortex tunnel experiences found in manymystical traditions and the “hollow body” chakra experiences “can be understoodas a complex synesthesia between this ‘hollow’ tactile structure and the symmetricalfunnel or cone of the visual field itself” (158). Evidence that these mystical experi-ences derive from cross-modal integration is provided by studies that advancedmeditators have more direct access to the experiences provided by properties oftheir visual field and enhanced visual-spatial intelligence (Hunt 1995a&b).Self: Divided Consciousness and EnlightenmentMeditative development of the presentational symbolic capacity involves a specialform of self, a witnessing consciousness that “comes to observe its own developedforms as the immediate medium for presentational felt meanings—the morediffuse the patterns thereby synthesized (space, bodily presence, and holding), themore all-inclusive the felt significance” (Hunt 1995b, 131). Meditation promotesdevelopment beyond concrete levels through the formation of abstract meta-phors for consciousness and self that are based on qualities of the physical world(e.g., light, space, and energy).Meditation-induced changes in identity result from the increased attentiongiven to internal experiences, which lead to increases in self-conscious and self-evaluation, a greater psychological differentiation, and clearer understanding ofone’s own psychological needs and attributes (West 1987). This examinationleads to a deconstruction of the permanent sense of self, an abandonment of falsebeliefs about the nature of the self that derived from mindless and unconsciousautomatic information processing. Unlearning conditioning and automaticprocessing leads to the realization that one’s sense of identity is distorted by a lackof awareness of the unconscious processes that construct the perception ofcontinuity of identity. Meditation practices bring about a greater awareness bydisrupting habitual identification with thought and behavior. The developmentof greater attention and awareness reveals that the appearance of a continuoussense of self is a selective and arbitrary construction from fluctuating mentalcontents, and that it is only one of many possible selves.Castillo (1991) analyzed Hindu yogis’ development as involving co-consciousselves and divided consciousness. The personal self, orjiva, participates in the world,in contrast to the uninvolved observing self, called witness, oratman. Participatingconsciousness is “physical, impermanent, and engaged with the world,...performsactions in accordance with social norms,...[and] is comprised of the personalmind, thoughts, emotions, sensations, and memories” (Castillo 1991, 1–2).Atman,orpurusha, observing consciousness or witnessing self, is “nonphysical, permanent(immortal), an uninvolved witness of the physical self and the world...and experi-ences those actions as if they were performed by someone else” (1). Taimni (1968)discussed thepurushaas the essence of the substrate of the subjective: the power ofconsciousness to function through and in collaboration with vehicles of the mind,providing the connecting link of matter and energy. Thepurusha, along with all ofthe vehicles that have not been separated off from consciousness, constitutes thesubjective part of this dual relationship referred to as “seer.”THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS157"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The goals of yoga are the separation of these two aspects of self and conscious-ness. The control of attention permits transcendence of the participating selfthrough the development of attention to the point where only the experience ofattention itself exists. Training of attention allows for a permanent meditationalattention in addition to the habitual focus on everyday activities. Permanentdevelopment of this inner consciousness is referred to asatman, true self, witness,or looker (Castillo 1991).Meditators experience both aspects of consciousness simultaneously throughrestraining participating consciousness. The ultimate goal of yoga meditation, theseparation of the observing self or true self (atman) from the participating self orfalse self (jiva), is referred to asmoksha, meaning “liberation.” With liberation, theobserving self only witnesses events (does not participate in them) and is, therefore,freed from the pain and suffering that come from an identification with the personalself. Castillo suggested that this split in consciousness is recognized within Westernpsychiatry as depersonalization, the experience of being detached from one’s ownbody or mental processes, an uninvolved witness to one’s own behavior, with thefeeling that one’s personality is unreal and not associated with one’s identity.Contemplative Views of the PostformalDevelopment of ConsciousnessDisparate meditative traditions recognize similar features of consciousness,including specific layers or levels of the functioning of consciousness that corre-spond substantially with conceptual frameworks of Western science, in particular,regarding views of cognitive, emotional, motivational, social, moral, physical, andcognitive development and evolution (i.e., Wilber [1977, 1980, 1986]). Wilbercharacterized development of consciousness in terms of the Vedic perspectiveson the evolution of the self, which postulates that development proceeds throughfixed ordered stages that constitute a universal hierarchy. These stages incorporatePiaget’s four basic stages (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational,and formal operational thought), but they extend beyond formal operationalthought in a series of transpersonal stages of development (visionlogic, psychic,subtle, causal, and ultimate or absolute levels of consciousness).Alexander, Davies, et al. (1990) and Alexander, Robinson, et al. (1994)analyzed the meditative system of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Vedic psychologyand suggested forms of consciousness both similar to and different from thoseof Wilber’s analyses of Vedic perspectives. Vedic psychology views the develop-ment of the higher stages of consciousness as involving systems underlying alldimensions of human consciousness—perception, action, affect, self, cognition,and ethics (Alexander, Davies, et al. 1990, 52). But their states of consciousnessbegin with sleeping, dreaming, and waking, followed by transcendental, cosmic,glorified cosmic, and unity consciousness. Although these latter states addressmany of Wilber’s stages, and even use the same terms, they do not correspondexactly. In particular, they differ in not characterizing these states as having aninherent developmental sequence. “According to Vedic psychology, because all158SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"the fundamental structures or levels of mind are inherent, they can thus be expe-rienced whenever awareness settles down to a sufficient degree” (56). This illus-trates the importance of a multidimensional approach; rather than a singledomain of development, the transcendental developments involve integration ofa number of different domains and specialized mental faculties.Hunt (1995a&b) suggested that mystical experiences represent lines of intellec-tual and affective development that are not post-formal or post-representational,but instead involve achievement of formal capabilities within affective lines of devel-opment, addressing cognitive aspects underlying valuation, feelings, and thepersonal experience of others. Hunt tied this to Piaget’s proposal that affectivedevelopment lags behind intellectual development because it lacks a fixed point ofaccommodation, which the physical world provides for intellectual development.Hunt suggested that a framework for affective development is provided by theobserving self, which generates a permanent sense of presence, openness, and com-passion. These constitute “formal affective operations” (Hunt 1995b, 118).Alexander, Davies, et al. (1990) and Alexander, Robinson, et al. (1994) dif-fered in characterizing post-formal developments as achievement of autonomousintegrated ego stages based on self-actualization and post-conventional moralreasoning. These higher states of consciousness proposed by Vedic psychologyconstitute a developmental achievement superseding the stages proposed byPiaget. The evidence includes entirely new modes of knowing and solution ofproblems of prior developmental levels; increasing differentiation and hierarchi-cal integration of cognitive structures, which provides more veridical or invariantknowledge of objective reality; and increasingly adaptive and effective thoughtand behavior (paraphrase from Alexander, Davies, et al. 1990, 57–58). Centralto these developments is achievement of a self-referral mode based on separationor differentiation of the self from other mental activities, “a new ‘self-referral’mode of knowing that allows consciousness to know itself directly as Beingwithout conceptual mediation” (Alexander, Davies, et al. 1990, 53). These devel-opments transcending representational thought do not eliminate it; rather, theyenable representational thought to occur effortlessly and with a liberation fromthe habitual domination of attention by the symbolic representations oflanguage. This permits the integration of the affective and intellectual functionsand the interpenetration of operations. This is exemplified in Wade’s (1996)emphasis on an affective dimension in post-formal development.Contemplative developments do involve changes superseding Piaget’s formaloperational thought. Piaget suggested there would be developments followingformal operational thought as a consequence of the continuation of the process ofequilibration. Riegal (1973) characterized post-formal developments as involvingrelativism, dialectical thought, and acceptance of contradiction. Post-formalthought overcomes concern with contradictions and the rejection of personal con-siderations and subjective feelings characteristic of the “objectivity” of formal opera-tional thought. Post-formal thought is based on a relativistic logic that recognizesthat different points of view are equally valid from their respective perspectivesand that one’s own view of reality is only one of many partially valid views.Post-formal thought recognizes that reality embodies many inconsistencies andTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS159"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"integrates inconsistencies within a broader context recognizing complementarityof perspectives.Dialectical and relativistic thought within mysticism was discussed by Schoun(1975) as “speculative formulation.” Schoun (1975, 5) characterized this approachas “comparable to the infinite series of possible views of the object, views that arerealized through indefinitely multiple changes of point of view...so the differentaspects of truth, however contradictory they may appear and notwithstanding theirindefinite multiplicity, describe the Integral truth that surpasses and determinesthem.” Speculative formulation accepts apparent contradictions because eachstatement is from a point of view and can only be part of the whole truth becauseexpression assumes a specific form that cannot be the only possible expression ofthe truth (Winkelman 1993). This view entails a realization of cultural relativismin superseding the limitations of specific cultural perceptions to recognize universaltruths (e.g., see Smith 1975, 1976). The recognition of cultural relativism entails anevolution of consciousness, moving beyond culturally specific and limited framesof reference, a partial transcendence of cultural conditioning factors. The esoterictraditions’ recognition of the relative truths of each individual tradition embodiesa recognition that culture frames human knowledge and experience, a realizationthat there is no way to express an absolute objectivity, only relative objectivities cre-ated within cultural systems. These perspectives make epistemology a fundamentalaspect of meditation in particular, and of consciousness in general, as is exemplifiedin Piaget’s genetic epistemology.Contemplative Development from Epistemological PerspectivesForms of meditative consciousness can be viewed as resulting from the suspen-sion of limiting epistemological assumptions made at earlier stages of develop-ment. The epistemic structures that genetic epistemology proposes are adoptedat early stages of cognitive development are suspended in meditative develop-ment, permitting manifestation of presentational and affective modes of cogni-tion. Suspension of automatization of perception, social evaluation, affect, andself permits utilization of nonlanguage imagetic symbolic structures. This episte-mological approach to consciousness is justified by the nature of consciousness,as well as by the perspectives of many contemplative traditions. Consciousnessshares commonalities with epistemology in being concerned with the nature,characteristics, and processes of knowing (Winkelman 1997a). Epistemology isconcerned with the nature of knowing, making it a basis for understanding theessence of what is consciousness (“knowing with”).An epistemological approach to consciousness is also justified by the centralfeatures of the psychological doctrines of Buddhist meditation, which Claxton(1987a&b) characterized as constructivist. This approach understands ordinaryconsciousness as a construction—a mental model that subserves and provides thebasis for one’s experiences and actions. The view of transcendental consciousnessin Vedic psychology is explicitly epistemological, being concerned with the processesof knowing and the relationship between knower and known. Flier (1995) used thetheories of basic subject-object structures of consciousness proposed by Kegan160SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"(1982, 1994) to illustrate developmental epistemic relationships in mysticism. Fliercharacterized mysticism as ways of knowing that involve the kinds of differences thatPiaget posited as distinguishing levels of cognitive development. Similarly, d’Aquili(1982) analyzed mystical experiences as epistemic states, outlining nine a prioriprimary epistemic states.These confluences of epistemology and consciousness justify the use of an epis-temological perspective in examining meditation traditions and their stages of thedevelopment. I propose that meditative development involves the suspension ofassumptions and points of reference that change understanding of the nature of self,reality, and knowledge. Suspension of previous epistemic structures also permitsintegration of previously repressed levels into a more complete experience of the self.The meditative SoC are central to changesin reflexive self-awareness, enablingdevelopment of the detached observational attitude. Meditative approaches super-sede previous epistemic structures by interfering with the automatized structuresthat organize experience of the world and the level of consciousness. This permitsreemergence of earlier symbolic forms, the presentational modality.The integration of these twoepistemological actions—suspension andreelevation—provides a basis for changes in the constructs used to understand thenature of self and reality. The construction of knowledge and experience requiresepistemic structures, assumptions about the nature of the knower and what isknown. Although they provide a fundamental basis of knowing, they also constrainwhat can be known. Epistemic structures assimilate to their own principles ratherthan accommodate to the nature of what one seeks to know. Consequently, thesuspension of epistemic structures canenhance knowledge and experience byremoving limitations. This leads to recognition of several principal characteristicsof meditative consciousness: the culturally relative nature of knowledge (culturalrelativism) and the adoption of universalistic perspectives; the constructed natureof human perception (suspending habitual cultural programming of the structuresof attention and perception) and the development of an awareness of neurognosticstructures; the false and incomplete nature of one’s sense of self (suspension ofparticipating self as the point of reference) and the liberation of the “observing self”;and transverbal and transconceptual apperceptions (suspending language descrip-tions and conceptual thought), which permit the manifestation of neurognosticstructures of perception and awareness.The relationship of brain development and functions to epistemic structureshad been suggested by d’Aquili (1982), d’Aquili and Newberg (1999), andWinkelman (1997a). MacLean’s (1990, 1993) model of the triune brain is usedto illustrate the neuroepistemological nature of consciousness, that is, the rela-tionship of forms of meditative consciousness to the epistemic structures of thefunctional organization of the brain.Psychic ConsciousnessWilber (1980) characterized development into the transpersonal realms as begin-ning in self-integration of body, shadow, persona, and mind, which permits disin-dentification with the different persona and transcendence of the exclusive andTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS161"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"restrictive identification with these structures. Wilber suggested “psychic conscious-ness” was based on suspension of some of the previous assumptions about theworld, using control of attention to produce suspension or deautomatization ofthe perceptual and cognitive constructs habitually employed. The application ofattention to the processes of perception and interpretation makes the constructednature of reality apparent. Also, it provides a deconstruction or substruction of per-ceptual and cognitive activities and an awareness of the neurognostic structures ofhuman consciousness. This provides an ability to act on physical levels with theintentions represented in the mind, for example, using the power of attention toeliminate physical distractions or the power of love to overcome anger. In additionto the perceptual characteristics (brilliant light, luminous forms, color perception)of psychic consciousness are a variety of emotional characteristics (rapturous feel-ings, tranquility, devotional feelings, equanimity, and attachment). These character-istics together constitute what is often referred to as pseudo-nirvana, which must beovercome if the meditator is to continue to develop. The features also indicate anactivation of the positive emotional system of the body without reference to externalconditions of assessments.Subtle ConsciousnessSubtle consciousness involves what Wilber referred to as archetypal structures,illumination, and transcendental insight. These changes in awareness depend onthe creation of coconscious selves through the separation of the participatingand observing selves. Self and individual identity change as a consequence ofunlearning of automatized (habituated) information processing and condition-ing of thought. The freedom from the pain and suffering comes from develop-ments of self at this level, which depend on the ability to both suspendand elicit attachments and emotional processes. The experiences of nirvana andbliss are a reflection of this suspension of attachment and the ability to experiencerapturous emotions independent of immediate stimuli for such pleasurableexperiences.But it is the Vedic cosmic consciousness that is described as based in theunbounded or nonattached self, no longer identified with thought but with aninner contentment reflecting a self not dependent on reinforcement from externalsources. This state has significant similarities with the subtle stage described byWilber (1980, 1986) in its concern with rapture, bliss, and overwhelming loveand compassion. These characteristics of positive affect are associated with thestate of refined or glorified cosmic consciousness in Vedic psychology, character-ized as reflecting a unification of self and the world and enhanced feeling or affect,particularly, love and devotion.Vedic psychology characterizes feelings ashaving a role in interconnectingthe different levels of the mind, particularly “the interface between mind andsenses and between the intellect and ego”(Alexander, Davies, et al. 1990, 304).A fundamental role of feelings in early development is in their role in mediatingsocial influences providing symbolic constructions of self and knowledge. Feelingsprovide the basis for attachments to others, which define the social group and162SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"moral definitions, and, reciprocally, one’s sense of self. In meditative develop-ment, emotional attachments are suspended to permit socially decontextualizedevaluations (cultural relativism) and joy and bliss independent of surroundingcircumstances. Feelings also link “the intellect back to the intrinsic evolutionarymotivation of the ego and ultimately to the inner self” (304). Feelings play animportant role in guiding decision-making processes, but in a more relaxed mode,being more flexible, relational, and sensitive to context. They also operate throughthe intuitive mode, which is holistic and more rapid.A central aspect of d’Aquili’s (1982) neuroepistemological perspective is theaffect associated with epistemic states. Beliefs about a wholeness, goodness, andpurpose to reality are attested to in the mystical experiences of many world reli-gions, where it is interpreted as union with god. Meditative experiences labeledas cosmic consciousness and absolute unitary being are both tied to positiveaffect. D’Aquili linked these to right-hemisphere and limbic processes, whichprovide emotional coloring to experience. This illustrates the fundamental roleof the limbic brain; first, its manipulation in achieving the ecstatic rapturousemotional states of the limbic brain; and second, the suspension of limbic pro-cesses in achieving equanimity, nonattachment, and other forms of emotionaldetachment. D’Aquili (1982, 374) suggested that biological bases for affectivecomponents associated with cosmic consciousness derive from connections ofsensory association areas and the inferior parietal lobe with the limbic system.Causal ConsciousnessWilber (1980) characterized the causal level as involving the unmanifest realm orvoid, manifested as consciousness without objects in the field of awareness andwithout the experience of the universal self. Void consciousness is achieved bycompletely cutting awareness off from theouter world, concentrating it underthe complete control of the will. Wilber characterized this development as basedon the subordination and abolition of the predominant centralizing tendenciesof the ego sense, leading to the experience of the formless universal self (overmind) in which all manifest forms are radically transcended and no longer arisein consciousness. This development is recognized as an advanced state in manytraditions and known by terms such as “the void” and “the void consciousness”(Wilber 1977, 1979). This final state is generally considered to be an experiencebeyond description and conceptual distinctions, permitting the development ofa perception of reality beyond concepts. In this sense, voidness refers to the per-ception of reality without conceptualization—personal, cultural, or linguistic—a state free of conditioning. This experience of voidness requires the obliterationof all conceptual distinctions and the development of a perception of realitybeyond concepts. Although void consciousness is considered to be “beyonddescription,” there are characterizations of this experience as reflecting a seamlessuniverse void of boundaries. Reality involves wholeness and a connectedness, aninterdependent nature, where perceptions of separate self-identity and perceptionof isolated objects are an illusory imposition on the undifferentiated nature ofultimate reality.THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS163"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The epistemological realizations of causal consciousness involve recognitionthat the objects and the self known are the consequence of the separations, divisions,and distinctions that humans impose on the world, not something intrinsic to theworld. These realizations provide the possibility for a nondual mode of knowing.Whereas thinking distorts ultimate reality in creating things, nondual awarenessprovides an understanding of perceiver and perceived as part of a system of mutuallyinterdependent interactions. This realization provides the basis for recognition thatobjects are mental phenomena in the sense that they are created through habitualprocesses of constructing the perceived environment. This realization is explicitlyepistemological. With this realization, seer and seen, or subject and object, are nolonger considered to be separate and inseparable, but part of this ultimate levelof reality.Odajnyk (1993, 66–67) characterized meditative experiences as involvingchanges occurring as a consequence of meditation, pushing the reductive and selec-tive operations of the brain and the nervous system to such a point that they essen-tially shut down the entire sensory apparatus. D’Aquili (1982, 375) suggested thatthere are neurophysiological mechanisms generating the epistemic states of absoluteunitary being, involving “an extremely rare subjective state in which there is no per-ception of any discrete being and in which even the distinction between self andother is obliterated. All being is apprehended as unity.” D’Aquili also suggested thatthe parietal lobe of the nondominant hemisphere is responsible for holistic percep-tion and generates the subjective sense underlying the experience of absolute unity.This sense of an absolute unitary being may be manifested in either positive affect,which is usually referred to as god or, with neutral affect, referred to as the void.A Hierarchy of SoC?This neuroepistemologically grounded neurophenomenological model ofconsciousness is outlined in Tables 4.1 and 4.2. These tables identify the epistemicconstructs associated with the levels of consciousness proposed by Wilber (1980)(with modifications, particularly, the social mimetic stage) and their relationshipto the evolutionary strata of the brain proposed by MacLean (1990). I hypothesizethat the different levels of consciousness identified in the perennial psychology haveunderlying epistemic structures (Table 4.1). Although the considerations herefocus on the developments subsequent to formal operational thought, Table 4.1identifies the epistemic constructs of the full range of consciousness (including thefirst levels of consciousness documented by Piaget) in terms of the awareness of self,environment, emotions, mind, social relations, and language. These forms of con-sciousness represent the sequential development of different forms of informationprocessing derived from the interaction between the different brain systems identi-fied by MacLean (1990) and the intentionality of the organism in interaction withthe different forms of the self (Table 4.2).These levels of consciousness do not strictly replace one another but emerge inan additive fashion through the prepersonal and personal levels. Some developmentinvolves an “add on” model, whereas other developmental sequences are based onrepression of epistemic states to allow for the dominance of other states.

What is added in the suspension of epistemo-logical assumptions is recognition of ordinary awareness as being based in a con-struction, an awareness which is realized through meditative experiences. Thisprocess is a central feature of Piaget’s models of the development of consciousnessembodied in the concept of reflective abstraction. Reflective abstraction is character-istic of each stage of epistemic development, involving the abstraction of elementsfrom an earlier stage and their reflection onto a higher stage where they are restruc-tured as content.The meditative suspensions (habituated attention, emotional detachment,self-identity, conceptual structures) generally follow the sensorimotor throughformal operations in the sequence of acquisition (attention to objects, emotionalattachments, self, and cultural constructions). The initial suspension of the exclu-sive (ethnocentric) monocultural descriptions of the world leads to realization ofcultural relativism. The psychic levels lead to the suspension of patterns of habitu-ated perceptual habits and behaviors, followed by subtle level suspensions of emo-tional attachment and self-identity and the causal level suspension of conceptualstructures. This appears to generally follow the sequences of acquisition. Culturaldescriptions, a late epistemic acquisition, are suspended first, followed by a suspen-sion of constructs in the order acquired earlier (perceptual structures, emotionalattachments, self, mind).Determination of whether the epistemological sequencing proposed herereflects an arbitrary order of epistemic suspensions or whether this reflects neces-sary and fixed sequences determined by neuroepistemic structures requires fur-ther study. First, there is a need to determine if the transpersonal experiencesnecessarily emerge in a fixed order. The differences between Wilber’s (1980)account of hierarchical consciousness levels andother models of transpersonalconsciousness (e.g., the Vedic psychology of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi [Alexander,Davies, et al. 1990]) suggest that transpersonal states of consciousness may notoccur in fixed sequences but emerge in different orders based on the intentionalityof the specific traditions.POSSESSION STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe commonalities in possession cross-culturally and the importance of thedistinction of possession from other SoC is well established (Bourguignon1976a&b; Winkelman 1986b, 1992). A classic cross-cultural review of thecommon patterns of possession phenomena was provided by Oesterreich([1921] 1966) in hisPossession Demoniacal and Other among Primitive Races, inAntiquity, the Middle Ages, and Modern Times. Possessed people generallyundergo such a dramatic transformation that it appears that they have becomeother people, manifesting changes in behavior, voice, expressions, movements,physiognomy, or appearance, and the presentation of an alternate personalityor identity. The continuity with similar possession phenomena in the modernTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS167"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"world is illustrated by Goodman (1988). Oesterreich’s and Goodman’s reviewsillustrated nearly identical cross-cultural cases, suggesting a common psycho-physiological basis for possession experiences. These biological dynamics havebeen explored by generations of psychiatrists who have attempted to relatepossession to their diagnostic categories for mental illness. Attributing hysteria,dissociation, and other diagnoses to possession cases has been based on symp-toms associated with these conditions, including psychomotor activity such asshivering and convulsions; loss of memory and self-orientation; dramatic changesin expressions and voice; glazed eyes and an internal focus of attention; psychoso-matic ailments; anxiety and panic attacks; and excessive sleep and periods ofunconsciousness (Bourguignon 1976a;Ward 1989a). Castillo (1997) however,warns of the dangers of attributing pathological evaluations to culturally valuedor normative activities.Winkelman’s (1992) cross-cultural research found possession SoC was notassociated with shamans, but with another type of shamanistic healer, the medium,who is found primarily in complex societies with two or more levels of political hier-archy above the local community. Cross-cultural research (Winkelman 1992) showsthat the concept of the medium is a valid etic concept, corresponding to a type ofmagico-religious practitioner distinct from shamans. Mediums are frequentlyreferred to as shamans, but mediums are empirically clustered in a group withdifferent characteristics in formal quantitative analysis (cluster analysis).The differences between shamans and mediums involve thematically relatedcharacteristics reflecting the socioeconomic conditions under which each typeof shamanistic healer is found. The shamans were associated with animal spiritsand hunting magic, reflecting their subsistence patterns, while mediums wereinvolved in agricultural rituals. Mediums had lower social and economic statusthan shamans, while shamans had high social esteem derived from their informalpolitical power. Mediums are predominantly women, generally of low social status,whereas shamans are predominantly men and of high social status. Shamans werealso involved in malevolent activities designed to magically harm their enemies,which were absent among mediums.These differences illustrate the importance of differentiating shamans andmediums, particularly the medium’s experience of possession, in which a spirittakes over the person’s behavior. Although both shamans and mediums engagein the deliberate alteration of consciousness followed by illness, involuntarydreams, or visions, mediums are more likely to continue to have experiences thatoccur beyond their control or intention. Although shamans’ spirits could act out-side of their direct control, shamans were generally thought to control the spirits,whereas the mediums are thought to act under compulsions from the spirit world.Indeed, the selection of the medium neophyte was generally based on the personsuffering from an affliction involving possession by a spirit.Nonetheless, although the initial altered SoC of the medium occurs sponta-neously, the neophyte then engages in deliberate procedures (e.g., dancing,chanting, fasting, and ingestion of alcohol)4to alter consciousness. Once themedium is trained, the experiences generally no longer occur spontaneously,but only when the medium intends to enter into an altered SoC. Nonetheless,168SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"mediums’ professional practices still involve possession, with the medium beingcontrolled by the possessing spirit. The medium is believed to lack control duringthe episode, often reporting amnesia for all that transpired during that time.A Diversity of PossessionsThe label of “possession” has been used to refer to a wide range of phenomena—ASC, trance, dissociation, hysteria, spirit domination, displacement of personal-ity, obsession, mental illness, and a variety of other conditions. To facilitateresearch about the putative phenomena, Bourguignon (1976a&b) established theprecedent of using the term “possession” in a more restricted way to distinguishit from other types of spirit relationships established during altered consciousness.Bourguignon (1976a, 8) definedpossession trancesas those involving “alterationsor discontinuity in consciousness, awareness or personality or other aspects ofpsychological functioning” that are accounted for by possession, a belief that a“personischangedinsomewaythroughthepresenceinoronhimofaspiritentity or power, other than his own personality, soul [or] self.” Bourguignon hasalso defined possession trances in a stronger sense as cases “in which the alteredstate is explained as due to a takeover (possession) of the body by a spirit entity”(Bourguignon and Evascu 1977, 198).The definition ofpossessionproposed by Bourguignon (1976a&b) does not,however, represent all emic perceptions of the phenomena. While some uses ofthe term possession have negative and pathological implications, many culturalconceptions emphasize the desirability of the phenomenon. This is illustrated inGoodman’s (1988, 2) definition of possession as a situation in which a “suppli-cant asks a being of the other, the alternate reality, who possesses no physicalbody of its own, to descend into his/her body for the duration of the ritual andto use it as it sees fit.” This concept of possession as an invited phenomenon iselaborated by Asante (1984) as a transcendent state of consciousness. The Africantraditions emphasize a concept of possession that involves a perfect harmony ofthe person with the spirits and the universe. In possession “it is not the personwho is being possessed, but the gods and goddesses. Therefore, the act of posses-sion always starts as an act of volition on the part of the person, not on the part ofthe gods. The person possesses the ‘gods’ through searching in the proper modeand finding harmony” (Asante, 174–75).Brazilian spiritists provide further differentiation of possession (Krippner1987). “Grade One Possession” is “obsession,” in which people feel under thecontrol of an alien spirit but retain their basic sense of self and identity. Thiscan be seen as corresponding to an obsessive-compulsive neurosis. “GradeTwo Possession” involves cases interpreted as past-life personalities or splitswithin the individual’s psyche. This can be viewed as a hysterical personalitysyndrome that results from the development of a negative alter-personality.“Grade Three Possession” involves the control of the individual via the influ-ence of another human, as is attempted in the practice of sorcery or witchcraft.“Grade Four Possession” and “Grade Five Possession” involve cases in whichTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS169"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"the individual is believed to be controlledby other spirits, who may inhabittheir bodies.Different spirit influences during possession illustrate that it involves avariety of relations that are flexible and negotiable, and not reducible to a singleconceptual entity. Possession involves a wide range of psychodynamics, psychoso-cial conditions, and therapeutic mechanisms, as well as variant degrees of influence(e.g., influence, obsession, and domination). Even the normal and pathologicalmodels of possession subsume a range of phenomena.Possession as Normative Communication BehaviorShekar (1989) characterized possession enactments as an assumption of the sickrole, which motivate socially significant others to provide the possessed personwith personal, emotional, social, and material benefits. Explicating the communi-cational intent requires consideration of spirits’ roles in the person’s social world,their effects on behavior, and their cultural meanings. Such analyses reveal therole of possession in shifting responsibility from self to other, objectifying emo-tions in terms and referents that transcend the other, and placing the locus ofresponsibility in the broader social order. These communication idioms mayfunction even for those not suffering pathological distress and, nonetheless, con-tribute to health, modulating relationships in both public and private life andproviding a social support network.The sociocultural explanations see possession as a phenomenon that peopleemulate because of repeated exposure to its normative manifestations across theirdevelopment. Possession has adaptive functions, including political, theatrical,expressive, and therapeutic ones. Possession cults provide a basis for personal trans-formation of one’s relationship to the world. Spirits can vary in gender, status,personality, and ethnicity and provide role flexibility, differences in forms of the“other” that one can emulate, internalize, and enact. Possession can alterrelations between groups and provide benefits of group membership, particularlyfor women under conditions of patrilocal marital residence and class oppression.Kinship terms extended in cult membership provide primary relations in the con-text of separation from natal kin. The possessing spirits provide ties of kinshipand a new frame of reference for the self. Possession provides a mechanism forthe incorporation of various “others” to reformulate identity and to providefor other mechanisms of self-expression. Possession plays a role in managingproblems of everyday life and in changing relationships between wives and hus-bands, enabling women to indirectly make demands and to achieve catharsis ofemotions. Possession experiences can also provide identity changes that alterpower relations and interpersonal hierarchies, a social resource for managingstress and exerting social power.Possession as PathologyThe dominant Western medical perspective on possession is that it involves pathol-ogy, evidence of a psychological disorder. The specific diagnosis has generally170SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"followed the vogue psychiatric trends—hysteria of the nineteenth century wasreplaced with diagnoses of neurosis and dissociation. A diagnosis currently in voguefor explaining possession is multiple personality disorder (MPD) or its more recentdesignation, dissociative identity disorder (DID). These conditions involve thedevelopment of separate personalities that exist dissociated from the ego. In the dis-sociative reaction, major aspects of psyche, emotions, and behaviors acquireautonomy from the ego and control the individual’s intentions and behavior. Whenthe alternate personality is dominant, the ego is unconscious and, subsequently,amnesic, generally being unaware of the periods of time controlled by the secondaryidentities. People in modern societies with DID have symptoms similar to those ofschizophrenia and are often misdiagnosed as schizophrenic (Castillo 1997). But inmany societies with a premodern orientation, DID is integrated into other syn-dromes, particularly possession by spirits.The similarity of modern pathological states to shamanistic SoC has been noted(e.g., see Hultkrantz [1978]; Noll [1983]; Siikala [1978]; Silverman [1967]). In con-trast, there is abundant evidence that shamans are not pathological from their ownculture’s point of view, nor from the perspective of descriptive clinical diagnosticcriteria (Noll 1983); indeed, shamans have been characterized as exceptionallyhealthy individuals (Walsh 1990). It remains an open question, however, whetheror not a psychological disorder is a key feature of the possession crises of mediums.Anthropologists have recognized the presence of symptomology readily labeled asreflecting psychological or neurological disturbances. Siikala (1978) characterizedshamans as having a nervous condition, and Hultkrantz (1978) suggested hysteroidor hysterical traits and a heritable labile nervous constitution. However, both rejectinterpretations of mental disorder, pointing to evidence that shamans are amongthe best-adjusted people in their communities. There may, nonetheless, be a linkbetween shamanistic SoC and psychiatric concepts of psychopathology.Epilepsy and the Temporal Lobe SyndromeThe presumption of pathology in ASC conditions is often derived from the similar-ity of those conditions to characteristics of epilepsy. Epilepsy refers to a range ofdisinhibitions or electrical discharge patterns of any of the lobes of the cortex, mostfrequently the temporal lobe. Epilepsy is not a disease in and of itself; rather it is ageneralized symptom of the failure of the brain to inhibit normal patterns ofdischarge and the synchronized spread of the discharge pattern to the point whereit takes over all regions of the brain. Epileptic manifestations range from the gener-alized seizures involving both hemispheres and resulting in convulsions and theloss of consciousness (e.g., grand mal seizures) through intermediate forms to thepartial seizures, generally involving only one hemisphere and not resulting inimpairment of consciousness. Epileptic electrical discharges are characterized bythe dominance of a slow-wave pattern in the EEG that reflects common synchro-nous entrainments across diverse areas of the brain.Epilepsy may result from fevers, injury, or disease, or it may be produced bymetabolic imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, endocrine disorders, and manyother diseases or traumas to the central nervous system. While the majority ofTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS171"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"the cases of epilepsy have no known organic causes, they are most prevalentlyassociated with partial seizures focused in the temporal lobes of the limbic brain(Schachter 2006). The temporal lobe epileptic may experience fear, panic, andterror or experiences interpreted as ecstatic or religious. Neppe (1981, 1983)found temporal lobe phenomena to be associated with deja vu and subjective par-anormal experiences. Some temporal lobe seizures consist primarily of subjectiveexperiences of visual, auditory, tactile, or olfactory hallucinations; a distortedsense of time; or feelings of intense emotion, such as fear or ecstasy (Adams andVictor 1977). These episodes are occasionally followed by a decrease in awareness,motor automatisms, agitation, amnesia, and a need to sleep.The Temporal Lobe PersonalityStudies5show consistent personalitychanges associated with the temporallobe epilepsy syndrome. This provides abiological basis for a long-standing realization about the relationship of divineexperiences and epilepsy. There is a distinct temporal lobe personality or “inter-ictal personality” (Schachter 2006) and behavioral syndrome characterized byemotional deepening, preoccupation with philosophical and religious interests,hyposexuality, hypergraphia (automatic writing); an increased need for socialaffiliation; changes in the personality, including increased aggressiveness and reli-giosity and changes in sexual behavior; and a deepening of affective response.While such religious features may be associated with other disorders, the temporallobe personality is notably absent of psychotic features. The specificity of this tem-poral lobe effect is also found in normal populations (see Schachter for review).There is a strong relationship between self-reported temporal lobe symptomologyand a variety of mystical, paranormal, and religious experiences in nonclinicalpopulations. Characteristics associated with the temporal lobe conditions suchas tremors and epilepsy and paranormal experiences are used in many culturesfor selecting shamanistic healers. These conditions are interpreted as signs ofdivine favor and selection for religious and healing roles because these conditionshave adaptive value in the professional functions of shamanistic healers through“kindling,” a long-lasting or permanently reduced threshold for neural excitabilityand greater susceptibility for entrance into ASCs because of previous seizure orexcitation (Mandell 1980). This indicates that the incidence of possession shouldbe directly related to conditions that provoke such trauma in the body.Social and Physiological Correlates of PossessionThe manifestation of possession is in part due to biology and part to socialinfluences. The widespread manifestations of possession illustrate an underlyingbiological basis related to seizure phenomena. Winkelman (1986b, 1992) foundthat possession was associated with behavioral manifestations of tremors and con-vulsions that indicate organic causes, which can be provoked by poor diet, trauma,stress, and disease. The conditions associated with possession—spontaneous illnessand seizures, amnesia, tremors and convulsions, and compulsive motor behaviorinvolving excessive, violent, and uncontrolled movements—indicate that behaviors172SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"and beliefs regarding possession may result from temporal lobe and epileptic syn-dromes. Cross-cultural findings (Winkelman 1986b, 1992) using Bourguignonand Evascu’s (1977) more restrictive definition of possession (involving the “take-over” of the person by what is presumed to be an external spiritual entity) foundthat practitioners and societies with possession are associated with specific psycho-physiological and social conditions.Possession ASC and Societal ComplexitySocietal differences in the incidence of possession ASC are revealed by cross-cultural analyses (Bourguignon and Evascu 1977) finding positive relationshipsof possession ASC with stratification, jurisdictional hierarchy, food production,and agriculture. Winkelman’s (1986b, 1992) replication found that possessioncorrelated positively with all social complexity variables from Murdock andProvost (1973), particularly, political integration, population density, and socialstratification. Political integration, however, was the only variable that indepen-dently explained significant variance. These results refine previous hypotheses,indicating that development of possession beliefs is specifically associated withpolitical integration. But these political conditions account for only half of thevariation in the distribution of possession.Physiological Correlates of PossessionA difference between shamanic flight and spirit possession is found in the associ-ation of the latter with amnesia. Although memory does occur in some situationsof possession, amnesia does not occur with soul flight, and in the cross-culturaldata, all cases of ASCs with amnesia are associated with possession (Winkelman1986b, 1992). The amnesic aspects of possession have frequently been suggestedas fraudulent. Oesterreich ([1921] 1966) rejected the fraud hypothesis for amnesiaand possession on the basis that the extreme agitation, contortions, and disloca-tions could not be due to voluntary actions. The organic basis of amnesia and pos-session beliefs is revealed by differential involvement of the structures of thelimbic system in various emotional manifestations (Wright 1989). The occurrenceof amnesia with epilepsy and the empirical association of amnesia and possessionsuggest a relationship of the physiology to the beliefs. Cross-cultural research(Winkelman 1992) showed variables reflecting the temporal lobe syndrome—amnesia, spontaneous seizures, the rapid onset of illness, compulsive motorbehavior (excessive, agitated, violent, or uncontrolled motor behavior apparentlybeyond the control of the practitioner), and the presence of tremors, or convul-sions—were all positively and significantly correlated with possession. A temporallobe measure based on compulsive motor behavior, tremors, and convulsionsaccounts for substantial variance in the societal incidences of possession beliefs,suggesting organic contributions to the incidence of possession ASC. The empiri-cal association of possession with amnesia, convulsions, and spontaneous seizuressupports the contention that temporal lobe conditions contribute to predisposi-tions to an ASC interpreted as possession.THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS173"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Combined Physiological and Social Predictors of PossessionPhysiological measures (temporal lobe conditions) and social conditions(political integration) have independently significant correlations with possession(combined 75% of variance; Winkelman 1992b). The physiological measure (tem-poral lobe discharge) accounted forgreater explained variance (58%) than didpolitical integration (40%), suggesting that psychophysiological factors are centralto the basis that motivates the development of beliefs in possession. The relationshipof possession with social conditions provides insight into why such associations mayoccur; societal conditions and institutional practices can contribute to the produc-tion of temporal lobe symptoms. The incidence of temporal lobe discharge featuresin SoC is significantly predicted by social complexity variables, particularly, socialstratification (Winkelman 1990). Possession traditions predominate in the lowerclasses of stratified societies, indicating that their deprived status and resultant expe-riences may contribute directly to the physiological conditions (Winkelman 1986b,1992). The predominance of women in possession cults often corresponds to geo-graphical areas in which women lack adequate nutrition can cause behavioral symp-toms (e.g., tremors) found in the temporal lobe syndrome (Kehoe and Giletti 1981).Dietary deficiencies can contribute to changes in the central nervous system thatresult in emotional disturbances and seizures (Gussler 1973) and produce temporallobe syndromes as a result of metabolic imbalances such as hypocalcemia and hypo-glycemia (Forster and Booker 1975; Adams and Victor 1977). Thus, social condi-tions creating dietary deficiencies appear responsible for triggering physiologicalconditions that predispose individuals to seizures and the interpretations of theirconditions as possession.Active ASC Induction and Temporal Lobe ControlPossession conditions may also reflect the absence of cultural traditions thatprovide early direct training in altering consciousness. Training in deliberatelyaltering consciousness appears to preclude the manifestation of temporal lobedischarge conditions that contribute to possession interpretations. Althoughthe shamans often deliberately seek their initial alterations of consciousness,mediums typically have illness and seizures overwhelm them before seekingtraining. Shamans seek their positions at earlier ages (childhood or puberty)than mediums (late adolescence and early adulthood). This appears related tothe differences in the manifestation of seizure phenomena and possession inter-pretations. Active induction of altered SoC may prevent involuntary inductionof the physiologically triggered states by developing conscious or ritual controlover temporal lobe discharges. Shamans are not possessed, nor do they sufferfrom seizures and amnesia, supporting the hypothesis that deliberate involve-ment in altering consciousness may preclude such conditions.Drug-Induced ASCs and Temporal Lobe DischargesThe relationship of drug-induced ASCs to temporal lobe symptoms was examinedat both the level of the individual practitioners and at the societal level (Winkelman174SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"1990, 1992). Among shamanistic healers with temporal lobe discharge symptoms ordrug-induced ASCs, the use of hallucinogens has a strong negative correlation withtemporal lobe discharge symptoms. A similar relationship is found at the societallevel, with use of hallucinogens significantly and negatively correlated with temporallobe discharges. These findings suggest that when societies use hallucinogens in theirinstitutionalized ASC-induction procedures, this usage tends to preclude seizuredisorders associated with their practitioners’ ASC. This active versus passiveapproach may be responsible for the negative relationship of drug-induced ASCand seizures in that active ASC induction may prevent involuntary ASC and posses-sion experiences. This prevention of seizure-induced ASC may be achieved by devel-oping conscious or ritual control or release of these psychophysiological dischargesthrough drug action.Possession and Dissociative Identity DisordersThese characterizations of possession as a dissociative disorder—where a split-offpart of the personality temporarily controls the person—seems compelling butmay still be questionable. Carden ̃a and Gleaves (2003) proposed two majoraspects to dissociation: an experiential detachment of self from the environment;and a compartmentalization of psychological processes that may involve a lack ofintegration of self, memories, bodily sensations, emotions, agency, and identity.Dissociative disorders in general resemble possession in that they typicallyinvolve a loss of consciousness or some loss of integration of perception, motorfunction, memory, cognition, and sense of personal identity (Castillo 1997).While dissociative amnesia is characterized by the inability to recall extensiveamounts of information, when amnesia is associated with possession, it is amnesiafor what happened during the possession ASC episode, not a general amnesia forwhat has happened in the immediate past. Dissociative fugue states involve a per-son acquiring a new identity or persona without awareness of past identity andforgetting the new identity when they return to the previous identity. The longtime frame of the fugue state makes it an inappropriate diagnosis for possessioncases, since the medium returns to normal social identity following the posses-sion episode. The dissociative trance disorder (DTD) involves a possession tranceinterpreted as involving the replacement of ordinary personal identity by anentity. Castillo considered DTD to be an appropriate diagnosis only in conditionsin which the possession trance is not part of the culture’s religious practice orhealing rituals and when it causes significant distress and social impairment,particularly in important areas such as occupational functioning. Castillo(1997) considered this distinction necessary because of cultural differences inresponses to dissociative disorders.Possession and Dissociative Identity Disorders as an Innate CapacityPossession and DID (or MPD) involve similar features in which two or moredistinct personalities or identities have different periods of control over individualexperiences and behavior. But Goodman (1988) illustrated why DID andTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS175"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"possession are not role-playing, faking,acting, or self-hypnosis, but instead,psychological functions related to the neurophysiology of ASC. Although theyinvolve similar psychophysiological processes, there are also important differ-ences between possession and DID in the cultural perceptions of the phenomena.DID experiences are not interpreted in religious terms, and DID patients aregenerally ignorant of both the processesand occurrences (Krippner 1987). Yetmost DID cases have an onset between the ages of 16 and 25, the same age rangeduring which mediums and possession phenomena emerge cross-culturally(Winkelman 1992).Goodman suggests that behavioral similarities between possession and DIDindicate that they are two different manifestations of the same human capacity.Cultural differences in interpretation of the experiences and social responses tothe person produce different consequences for these dissociative experiences.In cultures where possession is accepted, dissociation can provide relief fromdistress. In modern cultures where such spirit possession is not normative, thedissociative experiences can increase distress. Major differences involve the ritualcontrol exercised in possession cults, where cultural interpretations play animportant role. Western cultures produce greater difficulties for the patient bytreating the incidents as evidence of pathology, which compounds the patient’snegative experiences and limits therapeutic success, in contrast to those cultureswhere the possession is accepted (see Seligman and Kirmayer 2008).Numerous studies have shown an association between a dissociative identitydisorder diagnosis and an antecedent history of childhood trauma, usuallymultiple, sustained forms of maltreatment beginning in early childhood. Plattreviewed the evidence indicating that dissociative states involve distinct neuralnetworks that are triggered by severe childhood trauma. The core of self andidentity is mediated through interpersonal relations developed in the first yearof life and through neural connections mediated primarily by the right hemi-sphere and its orbital prefrontal areas. These right hemisphere areas are respon-sible for self-regulatory systems involved in maintaining a unified sense of self.These systems are disrupted by stressful parental relationships that induce auto-nomic hyperarousal, which, in turn, disrupts the right-hemisphere contributionsto the integration of consciousness. These dissociative reactions can be adaptive,resulting in creation of a separate identity and stream of consciousness thatenables the person to continue to function by dissociating from the stress theyexperienced.Seligman and Kirmayer (2008) reviewed research on dissociation in normalpopulations, where its similarities with pathological forms include an intensefocus of attention, isolation from the external environment, and absorption,particularly with internally generated thoughts and images such as daydreams.A dominant hypothesis is that dissociation evolved as a mechanism to blockawareness and memories in order to escape the intolerable stress of interpersonalsituations, for example, protecting one’s self from extreme emotional stimulationand associated autonomic arousal and stress that comes from an attack orbetrayal. The ability of traumatic stress to block consolidation of conscious narra-tive memories provides an explanation based on evolutionary adaptations.176SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Distancing of self and identity that produces a sense of unreality provides emo-tional numbing mechanisms that can inhibit the flight-or-fight response, whichin turn encourages a search for more relevant survival strategies. The detachmentencourages the hidden observer mode, where the depersonalization allows theability to consider circumstances more objectivelyrather than being driven byemotional fears. In order to seek solutions to pressing problems, certain informa-tion is compartmentalized, kept out of consciousness, so that adaptive responsesmay be made.Seligman and Kirmayer showed how we can reconcile the adaptive paradigmof dissociation with the obvious nonadaptive and pathological dimensions byexamining how the social context interacts with the psychophysiological bases.Dissociation following stress does reduce physiological arousal. Dissociationinvolves a regulation of attentional mechanisms that allow a selective suppressionof perceptions and memories, inhibitingthe normal integration of cognitiveprocesses and experience. DID undoubtedly interrupts the normal integrationof different aspects of the self.In shamanistic rituals these traumatic dissociative experiences are addressed inprocesses that allow the emergence of an integrated sense of self linked to “others”who provide a variety of attachment functions for self-integration. Sar and Ozturk(2007) propose that dissociation involves a detachment of the psychological selffrom the sociological self. In this dissociation, the sociological self becomes ampli-fied. This sociological self, which functions in the interface between the individualand society, undergoes an accelerated development as a consequence of trauma.This development allows for a protective dissociation of the psychological self, areestablishment of connections between the inner and outer world through thesociological self.Human evolution resulted in the ability to subordinate basic needs to second-order desires, those acquired through socialization. This ability allows one to con-sciously choose to identify with—or not—the more basic desires that we have asbiological beings. Socialization can also lead to disidentification and pathological-ization and demonization of aspects of our own self. This engages our humancapacity for higher order representation of the self in order to be able to disidentifywith the lower order, where the “I” of self does not identify with the “my” of thebody. This response is a cultural imposition on the weak biological/innate deter-minism of human development. Social roles of possession exemplify this “I” con-trol of biological potentials, where higher order representations embodied in thepersonalities of possession spirits redirect identity and behavior to adapt to vary-ing social circumstances. Possession must be seen in light of an extreme tendencyto identify with idealized social norms rather than the embodied self (also seeChapter 6 on hypnosis as social acquiescence).Dissociation as Integration? Inner Spirit HelpersSince dissociation is by definition “a lack of integration of psychological processesthat normally should be integrated” (Carden ̃a and Gleaves 2003, 474), it wouldseem that the dissociative interpretation of possession directly contradicts theTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS177"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"fundamental thesis of theintegrativemode of consciousness. Without question,possession involves some forms of dissociation and separation, rather than integra-tion, as manifested for example in amnesia. But what do the symptoms or processesof possession tell us about the functioning of the individual? These processes ofdissociation have been viewed as defense mechanisms to protect the self fromemotional trauma, to allow the integrated functioning of the emotional self inthe face of self-destroying trauma.Allison and Schwarz (1999) developed an understanding of the DID person interms of the operation of what Allison called an “inner self helper,” a source ofunconscious inner guidance. This personality structure that Allison consideredunique to the MPD patient was aware of all of the multiple identities and had agreater consciousness and control than did the ego. This inner helper also couldhelp and strengthen the ego in its struggles with the other personalities. Theinner-self helper (ISH) provides a psychological space for control, stability, clarity,and self-understanding. Comstock (1991, 168) emphasized the ISH’s ability tooperate as an organizing force for the person and characterized it as “some unify-ing or central organizing force within a MPD patient” that concretizes the normalintegrative potentials of the human personality for the patient. Therapists workingwith MPD patients characterize the ISH as the real self, the higher self, the trueself, the observing ego, and other terms and descriptors that have direct relationsto the self concepts of Buddhism. These mystical-like interpretations are echoedby Allison and Schwarz, who characterized the processes of therapeutic resolutionof the dissociated aspects of the ego as an integration or psychological fusion ormerger of the personalities.Brain Conditions of Possession and DissociationThe characteristics of the brain under possession SoC may be inferred in partfrom the similarities of the possession episodes with other psychological condi-tions. This information alone is not sufficient, however, as it assumes that posses-sion states are synonymous with pathological states. The perspective developedhere suggests a variety of normal and abnormal conditions involving differentadaptations to the potentials of a common underlying biological dynamic. Thisis seen in the contrast of outcomes for biomedical and cult treatment of posses-sion disorders like DID. Different forms of possession also differ dramatically,being distinctly different SoC, and, in some cases, may not involve the IMC.Nonetheless, there is reason to expect that possession episodes in generalinvolve the slow brain wave pattern of the IMC. The general dynamics of epilepsy-like disorders are the highly synchronized and coherent brain wave dischargesthat dominate the brain and consciousness (Forster and Booker 1975). In additionto the slow-wave effects of dancing, drumming, singing, and music discussedabove under shamanic SoC, there is direct evidence that possession traditionsengage the IMC in their practices. Links of shamanistic practices to possessionare illustrated by their induction in ritual hot and cold water baths in India (Mani,Gopalakrishnan, et al. 1968; Mani, Mani, et al. 1972; Subrahmanyam 1972).178SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Repetitive alteration of hot and cold water on the head of participants resulted intemporal and generalized seizures in individuals without evidence of neurologicaldisorder. In a study of Balinese trance possession performers, Oohashi et al.(2002) found changes from baseline EEG measures that included an “enhancedpower in theta and alpha frequency bands during trance” (Oohashi et al. 2002,435). They further noted that these enhanced theta and alpha patterns were dis-tinct from those of epilepsy and other mental disorders and persisted for sometime after the ritual activity. In a study in normal populations, Giesbrecht, Jongen,Smulders, and Merckelback (2006) found that there was a direct associationbetween dissociative experiences and heightened levels and power in the slowwave range, specifically, theta.The physiological basis for the association between the IMC and pathologicalsymptomology is illustrated in Mandell’s (1980) model of transcendent states.The physiological changes that result from CNS disinhibitions associated withepilepsy and other temporal lobe discharge phenomena, as well as from otherCNS conditions associated with trauma, toxicity, and seizure, involve the samebasic pattern of brain changes. The relationship to psychopathological conditionsis based in the increased facility for altering consciousness that psychopathologicalconditions produce and in the physiological structures and processes common toboth. Bear and Fedio (1977) proposed that the emotional features associated withthe temporal lobe syndrome reflect a hyperconnectivity between the sensory andlimbic lobes, a basic feature of the IMC.The religious experiences associated with epilepsy-related conditions alsoshare features with mystical experiences (Schachter 2006), including the inabilityto be expressed and described, characterized as ineffable in the mystical literature;noesis, a sense of illumination from connection with some deep layer of truth tothe universe; a transiency and passivity, occurring outside of the will and for abrief period of time; andunio mystica, a unification of opposites, time and space.Other mystical features associated with the temporal lobe personality syndromeinclude depersonalization and derealization, as well as intense positive emotionsand ecstasy. These associations suggest that the possession SoC are triggered byepilepsy-related discharges providing access to the innate structures and SoC thatare at the focus of the mystical traditions.FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF INTEGRATIVECONSCIOUSNESSPsychophysiological dynamics of diverse SoC engage the common humanbiological potentials that I have called the integrative mode of consciousness. Ritualactivities produce a state of parasympathetic dominance in which the frontal cortexis synchronized by slow-wave patterns originating in lower centers of the brain.These patterns are driven by several mechanisms that have effects manifested intheta and alpha EEG, reflecting an integration of information transfer across theneuraxis and access to the unconscious mental activities that provide the basis forhigher cognitive processes.THE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS179"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The triune brain model of MacLean (1973, 1990, 1993) provides a frame-work for explicating the functional effects of the modifications of consciousnessinvolved in the IMC. A central feature involves the evocation of activities of thepaleomammalian brain or limbic system, the focus of the production of thetaand alpha waves. The structures of this “emotional brain” play a vital role in sub-jective perception, using feelings for guiding behavior. Limbic system activitiesare responsible for an integrated sense of self, which provides a locus for memoryand self-realization, generating the feelings of conviction and a sense of authen-ticity that are used to substantiate mental ideas, concepts, beliefs, and theories(MacLean 1990). The origins of the synchronous theta in the hippocampal-septal area must have the effects of stimulation of these personal capacities. Thepaleomammalian brain mediates patterns of social signaling that promote a senseof community and provide for cooperation—physically, socially, and mentally—in ways that enhance self-security, social relations, and bonding and attachment.This reflects the integration of the interconnected heritages of the instinctualresponses of the reptilian brain, the autonomic emotional states of the paleo-mammalian brain, and the cognitive processes of the neomammalian brain.Behavior, emotions, and reason are synthesized in the integration of these threefunctional systems of the brain.The paleomammalian brain acts on information provided through emotionalmentation and its processes related to fundamental aspects of the self. These com-municative behaviors use facial expressions, vocalizations, and gestures that provideinformation about the mind and evoke similar experiences in other individuals,creating a common or collective awareness that affects others. The primary func-tions of the paleomammalian brain involve modulation of affect to guide behaviorand transforming emotional mentation into physiological effects. Emotionalmentation can provoke profound physiological changes when the organism is con-fronted with situations that threaten or affront fundamental aspects of self, survival,and interpersonal attachments.The paleomammalian brain’s functions are central to concerns with emotions,self, social relations and illness. The relationship of innate drives and needs, physicaland social influences, and the representational systems of the brain constitutes thematrix for many different kinds of health problems—chronic anxiety and fears,behavioral disorders, conflicts, excessive emotionality or desires, obsessions andcompulsions, dissociations, repression, and so forth. The ritual processes that inte-grate different sources of information and that reassess their significance for theorganism provide a basis for shamanistic healing.Operation on the structures of consciousness is another characteristic ofintegrative forms of consciousness exemplified in meditation. This provides greatvariability in the options available in physical and mental system activations. Theautonomic nervous system may show activation or deactivation of either subsys-tem; somatic and skeletal muscles may be inactive or highly active; brain wavepatterns may assume a number of parameters (but particularly in alpha and thetaranges); attention and awareness may range from omnisentience to total void;aspects of conscious and unconscious identity may be manifested or repressed;programming and learning may be accelerated; and different brain systems may180SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"be activated or deactivated. Integrative forms of consciousness increasingly sub-jugate the organism’s experiences and functioning to conscious goal-orientedcontrol.Consciousness is manipulated in shamanistic practices to produce psychody-namic integration through the elicitation of functions derived from componentsof waking and dreaming modes of consciousness and through the use of ritual tocontrol consciousness. Shamanic states of consciousness constitute conditionsakin to a “waking dream,” derived from coactivation of processes normallyassociated only with the dream mode (e.g., vivid internal imagery) or wakingmode (e.g., ego functions, voluntary focus of attention). These potentials are fur-ther developed in contemplative traditions in enhanced understanding of thenature of human consciousness and its processes. This knowledge and awarenessprovide an enhanced ability to selectively and deliberately access a greater rangeof functions of consciousness as needed.In possession, the structures of consciousness become further dissociated—and also integrated. The concept of dissociation would seem to falsify the conceptof theintegrativemode of consciousness. Yet dissociation can also be functionalin enabling the person to function effectively within given social relations. Posses-sion separates and compartmentalizes consciousness to manage emotionaltrauma and incorporates and integrates others’ emotions and self-qualities.CONCLUSIONSThe ontological and functional bases of shamanism and other shamanistic healerslies in the psychophysiological potentials provided by a particular pattern of bio-logically based organismic operation, the integrative mode of consciousness(IMC). The pattern of parasympathetic dominance, in which the frontal cortex issynchronized by slow-wave patterns that originate in the limbic system and relatedlower brain projections into the frontal parts of the brain, creates an interaction,coordination, and increased coherence of the potentials of many parts of the brain,particularly integrating lower brain processes into the frontal cortex. The diversecircumstances and procedures that evoke this condition indicate that it is a naturalstate of the human organism, a mode of consciousness. The independent discov-eries of access to this IMC and its potentials have given rise to universal shamanisticpractices. Potentials of the IMC are integrated into cultural institutions associatedwith shamans, mediumship, and other shamanistic healing practices because theymeet human needs.ThedifferencesintheSoCofthevariouscontemplativeandshamanistictraditions may call into question the idea of a single functional mode of con-sciousness underlying all SoC discussed here. Experientially distinct conditionsthat have distinct psychobiological characteristics andfunctionallydifferent fea-tures may also qualify as separate modes of consciousness. If so, then we wouldneed to propose a modification to the hypothesis of a generic IMC, the existenceof several distinctive modes of altered consciousness within the shamanistic tradi-tions. However, the hypothesis here is that they all share similarities related to theTHE INTEGRATIVE MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS181"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"selective adaptive integration of consciousness that facilitates a variety of forms ofhealing.

The endorphins released by ritual activities that arefound in blood measurements are peptides, which are not thought to cross into the brainand affect central activation (personal communication Arne Dietrich). If the peripheral acti-vation of opioids does not cross over into the central opioid systems in the brain, it leavesto science the challenge of explaining why these opioid-releasing activities are central toshamanic ritual. This is likely through their direct or indirect effects on other neurotrans-mitter systems.2. Many of the sources relied on in the first edition have been eliminated because theywere outdated.

The 5-HT3 receptors in the peripheral nervous system at the autonomic nervoussystem nerve endings release acetylcholine and norepinephrine from the parasympatheticand sympathetic nerve endings, respectively, and may also facilitate the release of dopamine(Kruk and Pycock 1991). They have a role in the regulation of analgesia, anxiety, andschizophrenic symptoms, but they do not appear to be involved in the mediation of thevisual effects of LSD (Glennon 1990).4. Although alcohol seems to produce a different response than other shamanistic sub-stances, it also induces a slowing of the brain wave pattern and a state of parasympatheticdominance. The most consistent effect of alcohol on the EEG is a slowing of the alphafrequencies and the appearance of slow-wave spindles of theta and delta as a reflection ofethanol action on the amygdala and the hippocampus (Okamoto 1978). Chrusciel (1982)noted that a general effect of alcohol is an improvement in the synchronization of the corticaldischarges, a decrease in beta EEG, and an increase in the alpha and theta waves. The effects ofalcohol are mediated at least in part by an action on central opiate (endorphin) receptors(Chrusciel 1982).5. See Bear (1979a); Bear and Fedio (1977); Bear, Levin, et al.

The universal distribution ofshamanistic treatments using these three features—special SoC, spirit beliefs, andcommunity rituals—derives from manipulations affecting the biological potentials.The healing effects derived from the potentials of the IMC are exemplified in sha-manistic techniques such as dance and music therapy and the use of sacred plantmedicines. Perhaps the most significant of shamanistic healing derives from theability of ritual to manage the general adaptation syndrome and its stress response.Shamanistic healing practices also share common therapeutic approachesin the use of spirit beliefs as representations that provide psychosocial, psycho-cognitive, emotional, and projective mechanisms. Spirits produce symbolicmanipulations of psychosocial relations and psychophysiological dynamics, espe-cially psychosomatic and psychoneuroimmunological responses. Spirit beliefsplay fundamental roles as cognitive models of the self and its psychosocial system,providing models that are used in rituals to restructure psychodynamics, self, andsocial relations. Neuropeptides and neuroreceptors function as an informationnetwork that links body and mind through emotions. The opioids and emotionsserve as an intercommunication system in which opioid release stimulates emo-tional experience and emotional experiences stimulate opioid release. Spiritmanipulation and the mind-body interface play a central role in the managementof emotional states, particularly anxiety, fear, and attachment. A biopsychosocialdynamic—better characterized as psychophysiological symbolism—producessymbolically induced biological changes by eliciting endogenous healingresponses and other recuperative potentials. Socialization links symbols andphysiological processes, providing a mechanism for ritual therapies to manipu-late physiological processes through their relationships with symbols that were183"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"established through socialization; this relationship enables them to entrainphysiological processes and to produce affective responses. A basic mechanismin shamanistic healing involves symbolic healing, particularly the use of naturalmetaphors that represent intrapsychic dynamics and provide a means of produc-ing psychosocial and emotional integration.The community ritual dynamics of shamanic healing also elicit endogenoushealing responses. The symbolic and ritual aspects of shamanistic healing prac-tices provide therapeutic mechanisms that elicit the opioid systems and producepsychological and sociophysiological effects related to attachment and bonding.A neurological basis for ritual structure is illustrated by the cross-cultural simi-larities in the characteristics of ritual and their homologies with obsessive-compulsive disorder. This illustrates that one basis for shamanistic healing liesin manipulation of the processes of the R-complex (reptilian brain) and thepaleomammalian brain.INTRODUCTION: BASES FOR SHAMANISTICTHERAPIESThe ability of shamanistic healing practices to provide therapeutic relief is appar-ent from ethnographic research because the users often obtain symptomatic relief.The healing functions engaged by altering consciousness represent importanthuman potentials. Noting that shamans are individuals of exceptional mentalhealth, Walsh (1990) proposed that shamans were the first to engage in the thera-peutic transformation of emotions, particularly, the reduction of fear and angerand the development of love, joy, and compassion.Shamanistic healing involves a number of healing modalities which aregeneric to religious healing. Shamanistic healing represents the most primordialform of religious healing, seeking the restoration of well-being through ritualand symbolic interactions within what is understood as the spiritual world. Theworldwide presence of religious elements in healing attests to their special rolein promoting well-being, something intrinsic to human nature. The ubiquitousassociation of religion with healing practices has a functional basis in religion’sability to evoke physiological responses. Religion provides fundamental assump-tions, values, world views, and meanings. This evaluative system producespsychophysiological manipulations through the implications of meanings andattachments for well-being. In manipulating psychological and social life andcognitive structures and beliefs, ritual practices can trigger physiologicalresponses and emotional reactions, providing powerful mechanisms for healing.The therapeutic procedures of shamanistic healers reflect the universalphysiological, psychological and symbolic dynamics of the healing encounter.Shamanistic healing engages universal principles of healer-patient transferencethat facilitate a cure through constructing the interpersonal relations in whichsocial expectations and attachments produce change. Healing involves the inter-cession of a socially dominant specialist (healer) who provides relief for the suf-ferer through ritually structured contacts. These interactions involve the184SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"identification of the nature of the malady (diagnosis) and treatment within aculturally shared framework of meaning and explanation that connects the illnessexperiences of the patient to broader systems of meaning within which themalady and procedures for its resolution are understood. These interactions canreduce stress and anxiety by a number of processes, including instilling hopeand expectations of improvements in health.Spiritual assumptions have special functions in human psychology, engagingfundamental aspects of the psyche. The ritual and mythological interactions ofthese personal spiritual identities such as souls with external spiritual entities orpowers help people address perennial human problems, meeting needs for mean-ing and enhancing self-esteem and a sense of control. Shamanistic healingengages the interaction of symbolic and physiological levels through rituals thatelicit previous associations that instill confidence and hope in ways that counter-act anxiety and its physiological effects. The multiple mechanisms include the“biology of hope”—attitude-induced immunological system responses throughpositive expectations by patient and group; the restructuring of social relationsand attachments contributing to the resolution of the sick role; and psychodra-matical enactments, (re)conditioning experiences or desensitizing stressful eventsthrough catharsis.Valle and Prince (1989) proposed that religion elicits self-healing mechanismsthrough giving people a sense of belongingness that engages feelings of euphoriaand omnipotence produced by the body’s own morphine-like substances, theendorphins. Religious healing involves a dynamic function of the psyche thatbroadens the individual’s repertoire of coping abilities. Valle and Prince character-ized religious healing experiences in terms of activations of the non-dominant-hemisphere processes that elicit endogenous healing mechanisms by experiencesthat reduce uncertainty, anxiety, and depression.Eliade’s (1964) characterization of the shaman emphasized engaging inecstatic states to interact with the spirit world on behalf of the community. Thesethree factors—altered consciousness, spirit relations, and community rituals—are used as the structure for examining the mutually reinforcing effects thatshamanic therapies have in transforming consciousness and emotions to enhancehealth and well-being.ALTERING CONSCIOUSNESS AS A BASIS FORSHAMANISTIC THERAPIESThe universal distribution of shamanistic healing practices based in the alterationof consciousness reflects their functional relationships to the abilities of healingand divination (see Winkelman [1986b, 1992]; Winkelman and Winkelman[1990]). Religious practitioners who alter consciousness as a part of their traininghave professional roles that engage in divination (diagnosis) and healing. Thiscultural universal of religion—alteration of consciousness in community healingpractices—is a ritual adaptation of human psychobiological potentials to psycho-social and therapeutic needs. This adaptation is so fundamental to human natureSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES185"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"that even societies that are disintegrating (e.g., the Siriono) and lack formalshamanistic healers still carried out collective ceremonial activities involvinghealing (Winkelman 1990, 1992).The biological basis of the IMC allowed shamanistic healing practices toemerge spontaneously from a wide variety of circumstances that alter conscious-ness and provide both general and specific adaptive consequences. Understand-ing the therapeutic effects derived from altering consciousness requiresrecognition that a variety of drug and nondrug induction procedures engagethe same endogenous physiological processes and induce common physiologicalchanges that produce healing responses. These general physiological dynamicsof the IMC—parasympathetic dominance, interhemispheric synchronization,and limbic-frontal integration—have inherent therapeutic effects. The effectsreflect activation of aspects of the paleomammalian brain, specifically thehippocampal-septal region, thehypothalamus, and related areas that regulateemotions, self, and other perceptions, and the balance between the sympatheticand parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).The IMC as a Healing ModalityA paradigmatic aspect of shamanistic healing involves the cumulative effects ofinduction procedures that result in the eventual exhaustion and reduction ofsympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and enhancement of a parasympa-thetic nervous system (PNS) response. The SNS to PNS shift involves conditionsthat provide inherently therapeutic effects. These features were institutionalizedin practices that produce this ANS shift to elicit a variety of endogenous healingprocesses. These facilitate healing by accessing unconscious information andpsychological dynamics; inducing psychosomatic effects through hypnotic sus-ceptibility and placebo effects; and evoking a general relaxation response by thebody, a regenerative and recuperative state of physical relaxation that facilitatesself-regulation of physiological processes.Accessing the UnconsciousA general adaptive aspect of the IMC involves enhanced access to normallyunconscious information through integration of different brain systems, whichpromotes behavioral, emotional, and cognitive integration. This informationintegration is exemplified in visions, where the symbolic image system underlyingthe dream mode of consciousness is stimulated to provide dramatic visual dis-plays of information from unconscious processes, integrating the body-levelawareness of the prelinguistic mind into consciousness. These engagements withour own unconscious potentials enable normally inaccessible information to beused in directing adaptations to the environment and re-modulation of selfdynamics. Shamanic SoCs permit regulation of typically unconscious processesand resolution of conflicts by presenting to the conscious mind understandingsof the unconscious mind. Although the unconscious mind is typically repressedby the dominant hemisphere, its dynamics, nonetheless, have effects on behavior,186SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"emotions, and physiology. Characteristics associated with the alteration of con-sciousness such as dishabituation and increased suggestibility produce therapeuticeffects derived from creating a labile system that is manipulated by the healer. Alter-ations of consciousness enhance emotions in ways that facilitate healing throughexpression of repressed aspects of the self. This is achieved through activities thatfatigue, and, consequently, reduce the critical screening processes of the left hemi-sphere, releasing repression of the right hemisphere. This expression of the nor-mally repressed side of the brain enables enhanced ritual reprogramming via thechants, songs, myths, psychodrama, and direct suggestion provided by the shaman.Typifying the shamanic engagement with the unconscious is a special formof visual symbolism utilizing the same capacities involved in dreaming. A centralfeature of human cognitive evolution, the development of specialized innatemodules, produced a fragmentation of consciousness, a dissociation of the con-scious stream of awareness from our automatized cognitive systems. The IMCengaged by shamanistic practices provides mechanisms for linking these outputsinto visual symbolic systems exemplified in visions and hypnotic states that allowfor the transfer of information into consciousness.Hypnotic Susceptibility and Placebo EffectsMcClenon (2002) argued that shamanic healing capacities derived from an adaptiveheritable quality that is manifested in hypnotic susceptibility and its interaction withsuggestibility. Hypnotizability involves focused attention, reduced external aware-ness, and critical thought processes that facilitate a focus on internal images andexpectations. Hypnotizability and increased suggestibility provide healing mecha-nisms through facilitating placebo effects and enhanced innovation derived fromaccess to the unconscious mind. The thin cognitive boundaries characteristic ofhighly hypnotizable people give them greater access to their personal unconsciousand the communication of this information to the conscious mind, providingsurvival advantages by facilitating the development of creative strategies.McClenon contended that humans acquired the hypnotic tendency throughthe association of hypnosis with placebo effects and their ability to facilitaterecovery from disease. Suggestibility enhances symbolically induced psycho-physiological responses that facilitate healing. Shamanic practices appear success-ful in treating the same kinds of conditions for which hypnosis has been shown tohave significant clinical effects: somatization, mild psychiatric disorders, simplegynecological conditions, gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders, self-limitingdiseases, chronic pain, neurotic and hysterical conditions, and interpersonal,psychosocial, and cultural problems (see McClenon for review). This suggeststhat the origin of shamanic healing practices derived in part from adaptive effectsassociated with susceptibility to suggestibility and positive expectations, inessence, a placebo effect related to hypnotic susceptibility; this is further exploredin Chapter 6 in considerations of the evolutionary origins of shamanism.Placebo effects have consequences that parallel those of pharmacologicallyactive substances, including side effects (Benedetti and Amanzio 1997). Effectsof placebos have been predominately conceptualized in terms of their ability toSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES187"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"reduce pain, but also reduce symptoms of a variety of conditions. These includeconditions with major psychosomatic components (asthma, hay fever, coughing,ulcers), mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia), andphysical conditions such as cardiovascular problems (hypertension and anginapectoris), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and rheumatoid and degener-ative arthritis (Benedetti and Amanzio 1997). Benedetti (2008) reviewed researchindicating that placebos exert effects on a number of biological mechanisms,including activation of endogenous opioids; release of dopamine in striatumand effects on subthalamic nucleus; conditioning of immune mediators; andreducing excitability in the limbic regions.The Relaxation Response and HealingThe relaxation response has preventive and therapeutic value in diseases charac-terized by increased sympathetic nervous system activity, particularly in loweringof blood pressure, treatment of heart disease,and reduction of premature ven-tricular contractions (Benson, Kotch, et al. 1979). Therapeutic effects also can beachieved by rapid collapse into a parasympathetic dominant state that can leadto erasure of previously conditioned responses, to changes of beliefs, to loss ofmemories, and to increased suggestibility (Sargant 1974). Induction of a parasym-pathetic collapse from stress and emotional excitement can abolish conditionedreflexes and can produce an ultraparadoxical phase in which the conditionedbehavior and responses are reversed. This relaxation response effect is a basicshamanistic healing mechanism as well as a generic form of religious healing.These endogenous healing responses are reinforced by a variety of shamanic activ-ities that elicit biopsychosocial mechanisms that address the effects of stress and itsphysiological consequences in the general adaptation syndrome.Stress and Its Psychophysiological DynamicsThe association of religious coping with more favorable outcomes suggests thatpeople find it easier to deal with stress within a religious framework based onbenevolent principles, particularly when people’s coping responses have reachedthe limits of their personal capabilities and social resources (Spilka and McIntosh1997, 52). This reflects the ability of religious healing to provide a unified psycho-sociobiological process in which personal significance (meaningfulness) plays animportant role in the management of stress.The central aspect of the coping response involves a “search for significance”which links religious healing to meaning-centered concerns and humans’ need tounderstand problems of existence (Pargament and Park 1997). Although religionhas often been characterized as a coping response involving avoidance, it is betterunderstood as a structure providing ways to evaluate and to respond to situationsthat fall outside of conventional understandings. Religions may provide a passiveor avoidant coping strategy, but many instill a sense of control and mastery.This generic effect of religious healing involves the effects of the mind on thebody. These are found not only in extraordinary phenomena such as hex deaths188SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"and spontaneous cures; ordinary functions of consciousness have downwardeffects on the physical levels of the organism, as illustrated in the phenomena ofstress and the general adaptation syndrome. Stress is a physiological responsebased in how the organism perceives itself and the situation and responds interms of those assessments. Stress involves both psychological and biologicaldimensions and also complex emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses tothreats that have important implications for their sense of self or that challengecentral assumptions that people make about their world. Stress results from per-ceived inability to effectively adapt to anticipated circumstances, producing anegative affective response and the resultant anxiety or fear experienced in threatsto one’s desires, goals, and well-being. Stress occurs when modes of adaptationare not adequate, when one’s assessment of external demands exceeds one’s per-ceived abilities to meet them.This inadequacy makes the causation of stress symbolic and related to theinteraction between the situation and the individual’s perceived ability to meetit. Both the significance and symbolic meaning of the situation and the individ-ual’s repertoire of coping behaviors are crucial elements in the situation’s effectson the individual. For humans, stress is predominantly social, occurring whenthe person experiences an inability to deal effectively with the demands of a per-ceived reality. This provokes a well-recognized set of physiological responses.The General Adaptation SyndromeSelye (1936, 1976) discovered the general systemic reaction to all different forms ofstressors, which he labeled the general adaptation syndrome (GAS). The body’sresponse to stress as manifested in the GAS involves three main stages: (1) stressor alarm reaction of the body; (2) resistance with a new adaptation at an increasedlevel of pituitary/adrenal activity; and (3) exhaustion that consumes body becauseof the inability to maintain homeostasis. The GAS sequences—alarm, resistance,exhaustion—are characterized by anxiety, followed by a combination of anxietyand depression, and finally, depression. These physiological responses to stress arebased in the ANS and the endocrine system and constitute distortions of normaladaptive mechanisms. Aversive stimuli provoke a state of hyperarousal in theANS, contributing to pathological conditions by causing increased cardiovascularfunction and disrupting the ANS balance. The psychophysiological responsesinvolve an increase in sympathetic (SNS) activity, with prolonged activationscausing physiological changes that exhaust the body’s resources and make it moresusceptible to disease. Prolonged activation of the SNS can cause collapse anddamage to organs and can lead to cardiac failure and death.The pituitary-adrenal cortex (more generally, the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system and the adrenal medulla) provides the mechanismmediating the GAS. The pituitary secretes hormones that in turn stimulate releaseof hormones by other endocrine glands and brain areas. These hormones producea general, intense, undifferentiated arousal and activation of the sympathetic nerv-ous system, which is basic to emotions, and a generalized physiological responseto the environment, which prepares the organism for action. Sustained stress resultsSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES189"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"in increased peripheral and brain activity, particularly, central nervous system(CNS) noradrenergic neurons; but the long-term effects of stress are more complex(Gray 1982). Exhaustion leads to a fall in noradrenergic activity if thestressor’s demands on the noradrenergic impulses are too severe. Synthesis thenincreases to restore noradrenaline levels, accompanied by an increase in the turn-over of noradrenaline. This does not habituate, with the release and synthesis ofnoradrenaline maintained at a higher equilibrium when the adaptation to chronicstress is complete. The synaptic vesicles responsible for the synthesis, storage, andrelease of noradrenaline have a limited lifespan and are replaced by axoplasmictransport. The increase in brain noradrenaline levels can be maintained for only alimited time until the vesicles are depleted. Noradrenaline may also be replaced bynew synthesis; but because of slow transport, it arrives at the nerve long after termi-nation of the original stimuli, perhaps as long as six or seven days (Gray 1982).During the second stage of resistance, the prolonged activation can lead to anexhaustion of pituitary and adrenal defenses, as well as of other aspects of the endo-crine system, leading to collapse. The response to stress is nonspecific in that stressaffects the aspect of the system that is weakest.The endocrine glands play an important role in the mediation of stress by thesecretion of hormones, particularly from the pituitary and the adrenal glands.The hypothalamus stimulates the adrenal glands to release adrenalin, a vasodila-tor that accelerates the function of the heart and the CNS, and noradrenalin, avasoconstrictor that increases cardiac activity and raises blood pressure. Noradre-nalin and adrenalin act together to mobilize fatty acids for use as energy. Excessadrenalin, noradrenalin, and cortisol appear to have negative effects on theimmune system, making the body more susceptible to infection. Stress can affectpathogenesis through the elicitation of activity in the sympathoadrenomedullaryand the pituitary adrenocortical areas. Stress hormones link the psychologicaland the behavioral conditions to disease. Psychological, emotional, and environ-mental stress lead to elevated corticosteroid levels and may be considered neces-sary for the physical response (adrenal-pituitary) to occur. Emotional stress alsoelicits activity in the limbic system, particularly, the hypothalamus, triggeringthe release of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) from the anterior pituitary.The adrenal cortex synthesizes and secretes corticosteroids in response to stressand stimulation by ACTH. Cortisol modulates the stress responses, but its over-production can cause damage to organs. The glucocorticoids break down bodyproteins and hinder the action of the lymphocytes, causing immunosuppression.The disruption of cortisol regulation also contributes to many other diseasesthrough general disturbances of the ANS.The Autonomic Nervous System: The Anatomical Basis of StressThe experience of stress also disrupts the ordinary control of organic functions,which is maintained by the complementary activities of the ergotropic (sympa-thetic) and trophotropic (parasympathetic) divisions of the autonomic nervoussystem (ANS). The anatomical basis of the ANS includes the hypothalamus andportions of the endocrine system, the reticular activating system, the limbic system,190SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"and the frontal cortex. The ANS controls heart and gastrointestinal functions andmediates the balance between stimulation (activation of the sympathetic division)and relaxation (activation of the parasympathetic division). Sympatheticactivation provides the energy for muscles through the stimulation of the ergotropicsystem and through activities in the posterior hypothalamus that mediate alertness,arousal, strength, and vitality. Parasympathetic activity is involved in storing sugar,fat, and protein through the trophotropic system and the activity of the anteriorhypothalamus, which mediates rest, recuperation, and sleep.The ergotropic system provides adaptive responses to the external environ-ment, whereas the trophotropic system maintains an internal homeostatic bal-ance. The ergotropic system functions periodically; the trophotropic system hascontinual functions. The cyclical patterns of consciousness reflect a balancebetween the needs for maximization of external orientation and adaptationsand the needs for internal adaptation and homeostasis. The tuning or balancebetween the ergotropic system and the trophotropic system is created throughconditioning, which sets the relationships that establish and maintain the rhythmicinteractions between waking and sleeping modes of consciousness. The ergotropicsystem subserves the fight-or-flight response, providing a global activation of thebody. It is responsible for mediation and control of short-term adaptation (ratherthan long-term development). Activation of the ergotropic system is associatedwith either positive or negative emotions, dependent on the interpretation madeof the physiological changes and the immediate situation. The trophotropic systemregulates the vegetative nervous system, from cellular activity through digestivefunctions and sleep; and it is responsible for synchronization of the cortical EEGpatterns, for relaxation, and for control of somatic functions vital for long-termwell-being of the organism. The primary function of the trophotropic system isthe repair and development of the organism, especially during undisturbed sleep.The ergotropic and trophotropic systems can be driven top down (fromhigher cognitive levels and intentional control) and bottom up (discharges inlower levels of the nervous system); in both cases they operate on the principleof homeomorphogenetic recruitment across different levels of the nervous systemand body (Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili 1992). The complementary activa-tion and balance provided by the ergotropic and the trophotropic systems providefor a hierarchical integration of the activities of the somatic, the autonomic, andthe neural systems. This manipulation of ANS balance is a central mechanism ofshamanistic healing, managing the stress responses, psychosomatic reactions,and psychosocially induced diseases.Symbolic Interaction and StressThe elicitation of stress mechanisms by social situations and by symbolic mean-ings that do not permit a response leaves the body mobilized for actions it cannotundertake, contributing to the development of pathological conditions—ulcers,hypertension, cardiovascular problems, migraine headaches, and so on. These andmany other problems are a consequence of the self’s inability to manage social,psychological, and emotional aspects of life. Fear of or expectation of situationsSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES191"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"can produce the same psychophysiological responses as actual situations. Physi-cally, socially, or symbolically threatening situations call forth the same physio-logical responses.Although the causes of stress are often social, cultural, and symbolic in nature,they nonetheless have physiological implications. Physiological reactions provokedby physical stimuli (attacker) may also be evoked by symbols or ideas (a shadowmakes me think and feel that someone is going to attack me!). The body’s homeo-stasis can be disrupted by symbolic threats to one’s self, with the individual’s subjec-tive response of fear having powerful effects on physiological functioning. Since it ismore the individual reaction than the situation itself that determines the body’sphysiological response, spirit beliefs can play a significant role in health.The body can adapt to chronic physical stressors, but it does not adapt tochronic emotional stress. Emotional stress must be dealt with through defensivereactions and coping responses. Central to human adaptive responses to stressare coping reactions based on the effects of meaning on physiological responses.Beliefs manage the effects of the mind on emotions, altering the possible stressorsthrough the significance that the organism attaches to circumstances. Beliefsabout spirits play important roles in modifying emotional reactions, effectingchanges in the autonomic nervous system and physiological responses.Dance and Music as Core Shamanic TherapyCross-cultural similarities in shamanistic healing practices include dancing andsinging, based in effects of auditory driving (see Chapter 4) and the linkages ofmusic to ancient audio-vocal systems (Oubre ́1997). Our capacities for musicand dance involve uniquely human abilities that sharply distinguish us fromour ape cousins (Malloch and Trevarthen 2009). These capacities provided abasis for a multipurpose human ritual dynamic found in cultures everywhere.Performance of music and dance are inseparable, reflecting a deeply embeddedritual dynamic derived from mimesis that binds groups into a common con-sciousness. Together they constitute an expressive dynamic of our species thatengages a level of communication that is vital for our species’ survival and pro-vides a powerful intrinsic healing dynamic by connecting us with sociality.Dance as TherapyWoods (2009) reviewed ethnographic accounts of dance that illustrate the diversetherapeutic functions of dance based in its ability to relieve tension and stress andgenerate feelings of revitalization. Woods related the therapeutic effects of danceto group therapy, where the expressive modality provides opportunities for self-actualization and the release of frustration. Dance can also produce an alterationof consciousness that engenders an emotional state encouraging catharsis andemotional release. The nonverbal expressive aspects of dance provide therapeuticmediums for the release of repressed desires and energies, exemplified in thepossession dances where participants act out repressed desires through the panto-mime of dance. The expressive liberationof repressed emotions allows for a192SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"rebound effect of tranquility. The dynamic engagement of dance can induce a pro-cess similar to hypnotic induction, leading to a release of ego control to a deeperlevel of the self related to the physical body. The literature on the therapeutic mech-anisms of dance emphasize alterations in the experience of the self and body fromASC; the effects of rhythm and the rapid movement of the body that provides anenergetic stimulation and revitalization; the psychosocial effects of the groupdynamic and engagement with a community; the effects of spirituality and ritual;an expressive creativity that engages our dynamics for play; the absorption of atten-tion; and emotional catharsis and abreaction (Woods 2009).Shamanism as Music TherapyThe relationship of shamanic healing to music therapy has been explicitly made byindividuals in the field (Winn, Crowe, and Moreno 1989). Crowe (2004) notes thatthroughout history music has been used as a curative agent and that its effects havebeen understood in terms of the ability of music to promote health and wellnessthrough enhancement of natural balance and harmony in our emotional systems.The development of “singing cures” and voice movement therapy (Newham1994) attests to the persistent value of music as a therapeutic modality. Music hasa range of physiological effects on the body, beginning with the sensory neurologicalsystems and including the involvement of glandular systems, the autonomic nerv-ous system, involuntary muscular responses, and reflexes. The effectiveness ofmusic therapy derives from multiple modalities through which music, singing,drumming, and related procedures affect the body, brain, and access to unconsciousinformation in ways that facilitate its integration into consciousness. The impacts ofmusic on the brain begin with the direct auditory nerve connections into the reticu-lar activating system (Crowe 2004). This area plays a key role in perceptual alertness,behavioral responses, and maintenance of the body’s homeostasis. These basic audi-tory processing areas in the medulla oblongata are located close to nuclei that con-trol heart rate and respiration; music’s physical effects on these areas mediatingstress may underlie music’s noted ability to reduce anxiety and tension and producerelaxation and reduction in stress. Vaitl et al. (2005) reviewed research that indicatesthat the motions of the body produce a rhythmic driving that induces coordinatedoscillations in the heart (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). This results in a reduction ofheart rate and cortical arousal and increases in brain wave theta activity.Music elicits and expresses our feeling and desires. Health is enhanced byelevation, integration, and resolution of unconscious and repressed conflicts thatcreate emotional illness and exacerbate physical problems. Functions of songs inshamanistic therapy include their ability to elicit repressed feelings, as well asconfidence and positive expectations and the associated physiological responses.Theuniversaluseofsongandmusicinshamanistichealingalsoreflectstheirability to affect humans through symbolic meaning. Shamanistic practices mayuse music as a psychological therapy to elicit the patient’s psychodynamics andunconscious and to provide emotional reprogramming through expression ofcultural themes, psychodynamics, andmotivations. Music may act at id, ego,and superego levels to release emotions and satisfy desires.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES193"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Music enhances human functioning at a number of levels that provide healingmechanisms, including engaging an innate primal biological function found inprimates—the ability to express emotions through vocalizations. The affects of toneand sound on emotions allows music to have a number of adaptive effects on healthfrom the physical vibratory effects on the body, through synchronization of brainwaves, coordination of emotions, and a common focus of intention. These effectsmay underlie the intrinsic abilities of music to evoke repressed emotions and tostimulate an intensive expression of and experience of those emotional states.Music’s effects on emotion involve its direct impact on nonverbal communicationprocesses, a “language of emotions.” Like spoken language, music has the abilityto both communicate something specific (an emotion) and elicit that same experi-ence in others.Crowe considered the ability of music to stimulate emotions to be the conse-quence of biologically determined neural responses. Music has a capacity forhealing through eliciting biologically determined emotional states that are innateand provide for constructive expression of repressed emotions. The subjectiveemotional experiences that are produced by music bring them to a level of con-sciousness where they may be reinforced by ritual. Music can serve as a tool forthe generation of insight into our own feelings, as sounds elicit issues significantfor our emotions, personal development, and values.Brandt (2009) noted a primordial connection between music and our emo-tions, particularly, to love. Studies of musical compositions around the worldshow that music has an overwhelming focus on love as opposed to other emo-tions. It is also linked to our narrative and imaginative capacities—music is aboutsomething. Contemporary functions of music include its use to modulate emo-tional states that enhance and transform emotionality. Panksepp and Trevarthen(2009) noted music’s ability to enhance our emotionality by relieving lonelinessand negative emotions of sadness and loss while enhancing love, happiness, satis-faction and other positive emotions. Crowe reviewed research indicating thatmusic appears to have a special connection with the strongest electromagneticfields of the body—those produced by the heart. Crowe proposed that musictherapy research and practice confirms that music has the capacity to functionas an energetic power that elicits manifestations of unconditional love. She con-sidered this elicitation of love to involve the most beneficial of all healing states.This activation of the heart through music and the resultant experiences of loveand compassion appear to be universal, and are extended in caring responses toothers. One of the effects of music is the induction of empathy, involving theability to understand and identify with the experiences of others. Music producesempathy by synchronizing our experiences through rhythm, tone, melody, lyrics,and other dynamics which produce a common awareness.Neurophysiological Aspects of Music TherapyPanksepp and Trevarthen (2009) attributed the powerful effects of music on ouremotions to derive from its capacity to elicit neurochemical responses from theopioid, dopamine, and other innate neurochemical systems. The musical194SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"elicitation of our endogenous opioids bond not only mother and infant but alsobroader social groups by facilitating emotional and social processes. Pankseppand Trevarthen noted that music’s established power to evoke emotionalresponses and healing reflects its ability to elicit core brain mechanisms thatregulate well-being through mind-body interactions, positive associations, andaffection. They reviewed evidence of the ability of music to regulate a variety ofphysiological functions, including heart activity.Through its effects on the hypothalamus, music may elicit enhancedimmune system functioning. Some of the established effects include the abilityof music to produce short-term decreases in cortisol and increases in secretionof immunoglobulin A, both indicators of enhanced functioning of the immunesystem. Music can counter stress responses, reducing blood pressure, cardiac rate,and other ANS stress markers. By counteracting the effects of stress, music hasimplications for a variety of conditions, physical as well as psychological andpsychosomatic. Music can counteract stress-related biological changes byproducing significant improvements in galvanic skin response (GSR), muscletension, heart rate and blood pressure, and mood and attitude (Hanser 1985).Music therapy has shown consistent decreases in verbal reports of anxiety andincreases in relaxation (Davis and Thaut 1989). Rider suggested that potentialaudioanalgesic mechanisms of music include endorphin production from thrillresponse, dissociation through distraction, and autogenic conditioning. Physio-logical mechanisms for the therapeutic results may include increased breathingand enhanced oxygen content created by singing and chanting. Music has beenshown to effectively reduce perception ofpain, apparently interfering with theCNS transmission of pain stimuli. Positive effects of music on pain include itsability to stimulate the release of endorphins and their pain-killing effects.A general effect of music on health involves entrainment of the brain,epitomized in the general characteristics of the IMC. The vibroacoustic affectsof musical sounds produce resonant patterns in the body that initiate the entrain-ment process. Crowe proposed that these vibratory frequencies of music give itthe ability to change the resonant patterns that give rise to disease, replacing themwith an energetic balance. Music appears to elicit responses from the energy fieldsof the body, ranging from the physical structure, through organs, body tissues,molecules, the brain waves, and the emergent experiences of consciousness. Theability of music to infuse this hierarchy ofthe body, brain, and mind withenergetic vibratory patterns gives it the potential to carry emotional and subtlebiogenetic energies from singer/healer to the patient and community, amplifyingthe energy of the therapist’s emotions and transferring them to the patient.Psychointegration: The Therapeutic Effectsof Sacred MedicinesShamanic medicines include many substances known as hallucinogens, psyche-delics, and “sacred plants.” Support for their traditional use as therapeutic agentsis found in their wide range of physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitiveSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES195"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"effects and in contemporary clinical studies (see Winkelman and Roberts [2007] foroverview). These traditions typically involve integrated religious and therapeuticapplications, a ubiquitous spiritual interpretation of their medicinal effects. Indige-nous terms for these plants embody the perceptions of these plants as havingindwelling spiritual influences. This led to the introduction of the term “entheo-gens” from the Greekentheos, referring to “the god within,” andgen, “action ofbecoming” (Ruck, Bigwood, Staples, Ott, and Wasson 1979; Wasson, Kramrisch,Ott, and Ruck 1986).These substances alter experience in a dramatic way, shifting awareness to anexperiential domain interpreted as sacred. Their uses include establishing directcontact with the supernatural or spiritual, relationships with animal powers andtransformation into animals, divination and healing, promotion of social solidarityand reinforcing interpersonal and community relations, a personal relationshipwith mythical reality, and the dissolution or death of the ego and its transformation(Winkelman 1996). These substances engage the sacred or spiritual to enact thera-peutic roles. The cross-cultural similarities illustrate that a biological substratum isresponsible for these experiences and provides psychophysiological mechanismsfor their therapeutic properties.Premodern Uses of Sacred MedicinesThere is a wide range of therapeutic uses of these plants among the indigenouscultures of the Americas (Schultes and Winkelman 1996).Psilocybespecies are used for both physical illnesses (e.g., fever, chills, tooth-ache, pimples, and pain) and culture-bound syndromes (e.g., hexes, soul/spiritloss, witchcraft, spirit afflictions, exorcism). They are also used to addresspsychosocial problems such as resolving quarrels and disputes, finding lost familymembers and domestic animals, and answering questions.Anadenantherasnuff is used for a variety of medical, religious, and socialpurposes. Its basic role in shamanistic healing practices involves diagnosis andhealing, as a purifier, and for invocation of spirits. It is also used to induce cour-age, strength, and stamina in hunting and battle, and for foretelling the future.Anadenantherause in social rituals includes annual harvest festivals, fertility rites,cremation ceremonies and ancestor worship, festive gatherings, and mock inter-village battles.Virolais similarly used for intervillage feasts, building and solidifying alli-ances, the practice of witchcraft, and in funeral ceremonies. It is also used to treatboth physical problems (stomach and bladder problems, malarial fevers, intestinalworms, hemorrhoids, malaria, mouth sores, in the treatment of rheumatism andswollen joints, cuts and wounds, child birth), as well as a variety of psychoculturalailments and social needs.Lophophora williamsii(peyote) is considered to have general healing proper-ties in cleansing the stomach, kidneys, liver, and blood. It is also used for curing,protection against witches and ghosts, maintaining good health and mind, incen-tives to work, release from guilt, temperance from alcohol, transcendence, over-coming misfortunes, guidance and future good fortune, access to knowledge,196SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"foretelling future occurrences, and motivation. In the Native American Church itserves to give purpose in life, create internal peace and harmony, provide a refer-ence group, meet needs for approval and esteem, provide a validation of identity,and to foster an adaptation to the dominant society.Turbinaspecies (e.g., morning glory) are used for physical conditions such asfevers, carbuncles, swollen or paralyzed limbs, rheumatic pains, and urinary reten-tion or blockages. It is employed as a contraceptive and to facilitate labor, particu-larly in cases of difficult child-birth. It is also employed for divination of thecauses of illness, death, or other problems, and to determine the means of treatmentof witchcraft and other conditions caused by fright and fear, “evil eye,” and anger.The premodern use of psychedelic medicines was applied for a much widerrange of conditions that contemporarily addressed within medicine and psycho-therapy. This brief review provides a glimpse of this broader range of potential uses.Psychobiological Bases of the Therapeutic EffectsWhile biological mechanisms underlie the effects of the psychointegrators, theirdiverse uses and effects present a challenge. The panacea applications of thepsychointegrators are explained by studies that indubitably implicate individualand environmental factors in the substances’ effects. The “set” (individual charac-teristics and expectations including attitude, motivation, mood, and personality)and “setting” (the physical and social context of use) produce quite varied experien-ces under psychedelics (see Passie et al. 2008). The primacy of set and setting effectsis reflected in the different psychotherapeutic traditions in the clinical study of LSD(lysergic acid diethylamide), three different models of the nature of its effects. Thesethree paradigms—called psychotomimetic, psycholytic, and psychedelic (see Grof[1975, 1980]; Lukoff, Zanger, and Lu [1990])—show that different effects may bederived from the same substance as a consequence of the state of extreme neurobio-logical flexibility produced.The Psychotomimetic ModelInitial research on the effects of LSD viewed itas a substance that created or mimicked psychosis (psychotomimetic). LSD canproduce psychotic-like reactions and temporary evidence of disturbed cognitivefunctioning, but can also produce experiences quite distinct from those of a typicalpsychotic state. These qualitatively quite-different experiences were exemplified inwhat Cohen (1971) described as a typical “good trip.” The positive LSD experienceleads to a change in the way in which one approached ordinary experience. Theworld is seen in a new light, with dramatically changed meanings and new orincreased significance attributed to everyday objects. The individual becomeshypersensitive and hypersuggestible. Thought often becomes nonlogical andopposites reconcilable, with an increased tolerance for ambiguity. The individualmight experience an oceanic feeling, a dissolution of self into a mystical unionand a feeling of being at one with the universe.The Psycholytic ModelThe positive aspects of the LSD experience led to thepsycholytic paradigm, based in recognition that LSD could aid psychotherapy.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES197"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The termpsycholyticmeans “mind-dissolving,” reflecting the hallucinogen-inducedrelaxation of the ordinary sense of self, altering the relationship between the con-scious and unconscious (Passie 2007). LSD could ease memory blocks, promotecatharsis, and shorten the course of therapy. The psycholytic approach employeda series of low doses of LSD in conjunction with therapy sessions. This led to a weak-ening of psychological defenses, heightened emotional responsiveness, elicitedrepressed memories, and released unconscious material. The ability to relive earlylife memories and to retain the memories in post-LSD sessions facilitated theprogress of psychotherapy. Psycholytic therapy appears effective with psychoso-matic problems and psychic rigidity;isolated individuals and those fixated ategocentric levels; concentration camp survivors with rigid defenses; patients withwhom classic psychoanalysis has been unsuccessful; disorders rarely healed bypsychotherapy, such as severe chronic compulsions and severe alcoholism;and severe character neuroses, depression, and compulsion (Zanger 1989; see alsoPassie [2007]).The Psychedelic ModelThe subsequent LSD paradigm was referred toaspsychedelic therapy, a term reflecting the “mind-manifesting” properties ofthe substances. The psychedelic model derived from studies on the effects of largedoses of LSD, particularly on alcoholics (see Halpern 2007; Yensen 1996). Thesestudies indicated that those who benefited most from LSD therapy had reportedmystical experiences associated with profound personality changes, suggestingthat the mystical insights were responsible for the therapeutic outcomes. The psy-chedelic approaches induce peak and mystical experiences that produce aprofound sense of interconnectedness, unity, and meaningfulness that contributeto a feeling of rebirth. These experiences gave the patient a greater sense of self-control and the opportunity to make use of these insights for life changes. Thiswas achieved through activation of repressed memories, producing catharsisand abreaction, and leading to a new awareness and sense of freedom.Shamanistic Approaches to PsychointegratorsThe different para-digms of the effects of LSD illustrate an ability of these substances to alter psycho-logical functioning in a variety of ways, producing a state of emotional lability inwhich experience changes as a function of expectations and environment. Theshamanistic healers manipulate these personal and situational factors as an inte-gral part of the therapeutic system process. The extensive role of the shamanistichealer in manipulating these set and setting factors before, during, and followingtreatment is based on knowledge of the client’s personal situation. Therapeuticsessions are preceded by meetings of the healer with the patient and the patient’sfamily or community and incorporate ritual procedures to guide expectations ofthe therapeutic outcome. The treatment session itself is usually implemented inthe context of a traditional ritual procedure that guides the ingestion of the sub-stances. Ritual procedures guide and shape the patient’s experience, particularlythrough singing and chanting, which present mythological and symbolic elementsto elicit and to shape the patient’s emotions and experiences.

Psychointe-grators stimulate the integration of the brain’s behavioral and social-emotionalprocessing output with language-based ratiomentation, egoic representations,and personal identity. These biochemicallybased physiological effects can pro-duce healing through integration of different functional systems of the brain.The process provoking the integration of these lower level brain processes intothe frontal cortex has inherent therapeutic potentials in the elevation of traumaticmemories into consciousness, which permits resolution through catharsis andabreaction, facilitated by the supportive ritual context. The tendency of these sub-stances to elicit distressing personal material, unresolved conflicts, traumaticexperiences, and unintegrated aspects of self reflects psychointegrators’ stimula-tion of the limbic system, provoking manifestationof distressing issues relatedto self and social attachments.Enhanced awareness of repressed memories combined with increasedemotional activation and labiality and disruption of habitual behavior patternscan result in dissolution of egocentric fixations, permitting psychodynamicreprogramming. This epitomizes psychointegration, permitting expression oflower levels of awareness and self-representation, including repressed aspects ofthe self. Reduction of egocentric fixation and altering relationships between theconscious and the unconscious facilitate changes in self-perception and dissolu-tion of the self. Increased interhemispheric coherence creates a greater degree ofintegration and insight. This facilitates therapeutic intervention through stimula-tion of memories into consciousness and the increased emotional lability, whichenhance the individual’s susceptibility to reprogramming.Psychointegrators enhance activity in brain areas MacLean (1990, 1993)referred to as the R-complex and the paleomammalian brain, or limbic system.The paleomammalian brain is primarily concerned with self identity, species sur-vival, family and social relations, as well as learning and memory and sexual andaggressive emotions and their integration in human behavior. The activation ofthe paleomammalian brain and its functions by the psychointegrators enhancessystemic integration of emotional information into consciousness in the frontalcortex. The stimulation of the R-complex by psychointegrators enhances integra-tion of all areas of the brain and heightens arousal and awareness. Experiences oflower structures of the brain and consciousness that are elicited by the psychointe-grators were discussed by Grof (1975, 1980, 1992) as transbiological realms: theperinatal domain of experiences and the transpersonal domain. The transpersonaldomain of the archetypal and mystical structures reveals dimensions of humanSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES199"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"consciousness and identity beyond (or perhaps better characterized as “below”)egoic identity. These innate processes of organismic self-representation and regula-tion that are part of our evolved mental structures are superseded in human devel-opment in the creation of social selves and culturally produced egoic psychologicalstructures. The consciousness of these evolutionarily earlier structures reemergeinto prominence because of serotonin disinhibition and loss of their inhibitoryeffects on the mesolimbic temporal lobe structures. The elevation of activity of earlyevolutionary structures of the brain is a common effect produced by psychointegra-tors, reflecting an innate mode of consciousness that is the basis for the universalpresence of shamanistic healing practices.These systematic changes involve an overall effect of high-voltage brain wavedischarges originating in the limbic system that replace the normal wakingdesynchronized fast-wave brain patterns with slow-wave (theta) cortical synchro-nization, which characterizes the integrative mode of consciousness (IMC). TheIMC seeks optimization of homeostatic balance among different functionalsystems of the brain and to enhance integrative or holistic operations of the brain.Meditation as Biopsychosocial TherapyIn contrast to the excited behaviors of shamanic and mediumistic practices,meditation emphasizes an inward focus of attention that reduces emotionalattachments in an effort to achieve emotional equanimity and nonattachmentto desires. A central aspect of meditation is an affective (emotional) developmentprovided by the observing self, which is developed through the processes of medi-tation (Hunt 1995a; Wade 1996). This witnessing consciousness is capable ofobserving its own forms and developing formal affective operations that aredecentered through an “other,” an alternative to the ordinary self developed inmeditation. Meditation changes self and emotions through development ofattentional control, which enhances integration of emotion and thought, andthe suspension of emotional attachments to achieve greater objectivity, detach-ment, and freedom from suffering. Meditators’ intentional enhancement of controlof attention increases awareness ofmental processes and enhances control ofemotions. The focus of meditation on development of reflexive self-awarenesscreates a detached observational attitude that permits suspension of personaland social evaluative processes that engage painful emotions.A common emphasis of the Asian psychologies is that most human behavioris mindless and unconscious. Unlearning this conditioning of thought andbehavior is fundamental to realization of greater control of one’s behavior andexperiences. The development of this control leads to a greater awareness of theunconscious processes, with sustained attention increasing self-awareness. Medi-tation increases awareness of what are usually unconscious mental processes,through deautomatization, which changes perception, motor habits, and cogni-tion from their habituated, repetitive, and routinized processes. By focusingattention, meditation enables the practitioner to develop a greater awareness ofhow all information, ranging from perceptual stimuli to concepts of self and the200SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"universe, is habitually processed. Shapiro (1990) reviewed studies illustrating thatmeditation enhances self-actualization, particularly, through dealing with socialconditioning and fears. Therapeutic effects of meditation also derive from sys-tematic desensitization, the reduction of response to threatening stimuli. Themeditative state appears to automatically lead to the manifestation of materialthat is emotionally salient, an automatic consequence of reducing ordinary fixa-tions of attention. Meditation creates a relaxed physical state during whichunpleasant memories are slowly manifested in nonthreatening contexts. Medita-tion then provides desensitization of distressing thoughts by permitting theiroccurrence in conjunction with extreme relaxation, a form of countercondition-ing that produces a desensitization to anxiety-evoking thoughts. Insight into theprocesses through which the individual habitually constructs his or her personalversion of reality enhances the possibility of changing patterns of cognition andpsychophysiological reactions that are self-defeating or compromise healing pro-cesses. Meditation desensitizes one to distressing thoughts by permitting theiremergence in conjunction with extreme relaxation, as exemplified in the practicesof insight meditation, which focuses on arising perceptions, memories, and emo-tions and on the processing of their implications for self, thought, and behavior.This emergence of thoughts produces anenhanced awareness of unconsciousprocesses, changing the ordinary sense of self and identity.Meditative practices exemplify the shamanistic traditions’ modification of selfand emotions and relationships with others. Meditation plays an important role indevelopment of new ways of managing emotions. Feelings mediate social influen-ces on the self, providing for attachments to others that define sense of self and thatprovide security. Alexander, Davies, et al. (1990) characterized the views of Vedicpsychology on feelings as interconnecting the different levels of mind. Meditativeconsciousness enhances the role of feelings in providing information, linking ego,inner self, the intellect, and motivations to guide intuitive decision-makingprocesses. Meditation enables one to transcend the earlier stages of emotionaldevelopment based on social constructions of self and desires and to exerciseexceptional emotional control, both eliciting and suspending emotional processes.This extraordinary emotional control is manifested in experiences of rapture, bliss,and overwhelming love and compassion, which meditators are able to experienceindependent of any immediate stimuli for such pleasure. This is possible becauseof the control of attention and its use to develop new aspects of consciousnessand self. The transpersonal self (atman, “true self,” or witness), which is uninvolvedin the world of the personal or participating self and its attachments, is conse-quently free from the pain and suffering of the personal self.Meditation leads to greater psychological differentiation, with a clearer under-standing of one’s own psychological needs and attributes, leading to increased self-acceptance and self-esteem, enhanced self-control and confidence, increased empa-thy, and greater self-actualization. Insight meditation focuses on perceptions,memories, thoughts, sensations, and emotions. This provides primary material forpsychodynamic processing of patterns of thought and behavior and an opportunityfor examination of the nature of personal and psychological processes. The healthfulquality of meditation is widely recognized inthe context of “transcendentalSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES201"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"experience.” Walsh (1980) reviewed evidence that indicated that these experiencesoccur most frequently among those who are psychologically the most healthy. Tran-scendent experiences are most likely during advanced stages of psychotherapy,among those who are most self-actualized, those who are better educated and eco-nomically more successful, people who are less racist, and those who test at higherlevels of psychological well-being. Maslow’s (1971) analysis of the hierarchy ofneeds placed these transcendent experiences at the apex of human development;meditation clearly supports that development.Therapeutic Effectiveness of MeditationThere are many assessments1of the therapeutic efficacy of meditation. Tayloret al.

Studies have shown successful out-comes in dealing with fears, phobias, personal integration and control, stress andtension management, and a range of physical changes, including the lowering ofblood pressure. Meditation and other progressive relaxation techniques producea similar physiological pattern (“the relaxation response”), including significantdecreases in heart rate, respiration, minute ventilation, and EMG (Benson,Kotch, et al. 1979). The relaxed states characteristic of many meditation experi-ences are incompatible with this stress response, making meditation useful inthe treatment of chronic anxiety and stress-related and psychosomatic illness.Physical and psychosomatic benefits of meditation are found in the treatmentof myocardial infarction, bronchial asthma, insomnia, cholesterol levels, andhigh blood pressure. Meditation improves responsiveness to medication for arange of stress-related illnesses and contributes to reductions in addictive druguse, mood elevation, and improvement in affect. Meditation has also been usedas an ego regression technique, which prompts the manifestation of unconsciousmaterial; in assisting individuals in gaining a sense of inner directedness andincreased self-responsibility; and as a means of emotional management.Studies continue to support the effectiveness of meditation as a treatment oradjunct for a wide range of disorders. A specific form of meditation, conceptual-ized as mindfulness-based treatment approaches, is effective for a range of ail-ments (see Baer [2006], Shapiro and Carlson [2009]). Incorporating features ofstress-reduction practices, cognitive therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, anddevelopment of acceptance and commitment skills, mindfulness-based treatmentapproaches have the capacity to address both contributory and causal factors formany conditions: anxiety disorders, trauma, depression, food and drug addic-tions, mental illness and personality disorders, cancers, chronic pain, and a rangeof relationship problems (see Baer [2006] for review articles, also see Shapiro andCarlson [2009]).202SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"There is also evidence of effectiveness in a variety of severe physical condi-tions (Chambers, Gullone, and Allen 2009).Studies of applications to chronicpain found both reductions in pain and enhanced functionality, independent ofeffects on stress.

In addition totreatment of anxiety related-dimensions of depression, meditation showed effec-tiveness in chronically mentally ill and psychotic patients, who showed evidenceof increased awareness of the delusional nature of their thoughts; and borderlinepersonality disorders, reducing suppression and avoidance of disturbingthoughts and emotions and enhancing emotional experiences and meta-cognitive awareness. The effectiveness of mindfulness-based meditationapproaches in the treatment of cancer was found across a wide range of cancerdiagnoses (Speca, Carlson, Mackenzie, and Angen 2006). The authors reviewedstudies indicating reductions not only in stress but also in levels of depression,tension, anger, and sleep and mood disturbances, as well as a wide range of symp-toms (neurological, gastrointenstinal,). Even more positively, there were reportedincreases in quality of life, as well as enhanced measures of immune system func-tioning (increases in T-cell production, interferon gamma, and natural killercells). Shapiro and Carlson (2009) suggest that studies establish the long-termeffectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in cancer patients, specifically,reducing a variety of psychophysiological and physical symptoms; and in thetreatment of cardiac conditions, including both psychological and biologicaloutcomes.Walton and Levitsky (1994) outlined a neuroendocrine model for the mech-anisms of meditation. They noted the ability of transcendental meditation (TM)to reduce stress and enhance serotonin functioning, counteracting neurochemicaland neuroendocrine dynamics caused by chronic stress. They proposed thatmediation’s primary actions are on the locus coeruleus, increasing serotoninavailability and producing an inhibitory action paralleling the effects of sedativesand opiates. Meditation leads to increases in serotonin levels, leading to reduc-tions in cortisol levels, and indirectly to reduction of stimulation of limbic angerand fear centers and the activity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis thatcontributes to chronic stress.Chambers, Gullone, and Allen (2009) pointed out that mindfulness media-tion approaches differ in fundamental ways from contemporary psychologicalapproaches; instead of repressing emotional experiences, meditation retrainsawareness to reduce reactivity and identification with troubling memories andemotions. By changing the automatic appraisal processes, mindfulness medita-tion can prevent the evocation of disturbing emotions.Specific Stress-Related Effects of MeditationAlexander, Robinson, Orme-Johnson, Schneider, and Walton (1994) provided ameta-analysis illustrating significantly greater effects of TM compared to otherrelaxation techniques in reducing arousal, trait anxiety, drug abuse, and hyper-tension.

While some earlierresearch concluded that meditation does not produce a unique effect, but, ratherjust the beneficial consequences that come from rest, subsequent research (Rubia2009) has indicated otherwise. Alexander, Robinson, et al. (1994) reviewed stud-ies on TM practices that suggested meditation may reduce arousal and produce adeep physiological rest that is distinct from ordinary resting. Rubia (2009) notedthe evidence for the effectiveness of meditation in the treatment of a variety ofpsychiatric disorders that is a consequence of not just anxiety reduction but alsoenhancing endocrine functions and the functional upregulation of areas of thebrain involved in the control of attention and emotional regulation. Meditationresults in the induction of a restful metabolic state with decreased SNS activityand increased activity in the PNS, a process fundamental to relaxation, rest, andsleep. But these meditation-induced changes in the PNS and SNS reactions aredifferent from the effects of sleep, as indicated by a wide range of physiologicalparameters. Differences in the effects of relaxation and meditation include medi-tation’s recruitment of additional neural networks in the fronto-limbic emotionalcircuitry and the fronto-parietal attentional networks. Rubia proposed that thisreflects the ability of meditation to engage a stronger entrainment of the auto-nomic control areas. The enhanced fronto-parietal connection is reflected inlong-term effects on the structural plasticity of the brain.THE SPIRIT WORLD AS A THERAPEUTIC RESOURCE:SYMBOLIC HEALINGA key reason for the shaman’s ritual alteration of consciousness was to access thespirit world. Spirit beliefs are central features of symbolic explanatory models thatrepresent aspects of personal and social consciousness. Spirits engage a variety ofhealing mechanisms involving symbolic processes in which manipulation of spiritbeliefs and relations affect biological processes. Spirits play a central role in shaman-istic healing rituals through the elicitation and manipulation of emotions and theirphysiological consequences. These processes intervene in stress mechanisms and inelicitation of psychoneuroimmunological responses. Rituals engage the emotional-neurological and mind-body interfaces by using spirit concepts to manipulateaspects of biological, social, and personal identity. Neuropeptides and neurorecep-tors function as an information network that links body and mind through emo-tions and meanings, including those provided by spirit constructs.Spirits as Representations of Mentaland Social ProcessesSpirits are a central feature of mythic beliefs and explanations regarding the motiva-tions of humans, animals, and the forces of the natural and social world. Durkheim(1915) showed that spirit beliefs reflect structures and patterns of relationships in204SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"society, representing abstract processes, relations, and groups. Spirits also representbasic aspects of human psychology, our drives, emotions, and other cognitive pro-cesses (Winkelman 2004a).Spirits reflect human needs to make sense of experience, to attribute meaningto occurrences. The normal human practice of explaining events by attributingthem to intentional actors is a fundamental cognitive tendency. This attributionis based in the metaphoric extension of the self and in its capabilities for modelingthe unknown (Winkelman 2004a). This tendency is the underlying basis for theattribution of causal efficacy to spiritual actors.Spirit conceptions also involve generic structures of human thought involv-ing concepts of self and other, and structures of meaning attribution. Thesebeliefs provide conceptual categories for representing structures of our self andthe individual and collective unconscious. Spirit beliefs provide symbol systemsfor expressing our human intrapsychic dynamics and psychological and cognitiveprocesses.Understanding spirits as representations of social groups and internal forcesillustrates how ritual healing involves a restructuring of individual psychodynam-ics and collective psychology. These psychodynamic implications of spiritsderive from their roles as social actors. Spirit beliefs constitute a symbolic systemrepresenting norms, values, and ideal behaviors, directing people toward propersocial behavior. Spirits and supernatural beings consequently communicateabout social traditions, valued attitudes, morals, ideal patterns of behavior, andpreferred psychocultural dynamics. These symbolic structures also representhumans’ needs and feelings, shaping them in the relationships between theindividuals and society.The role of spirit beliefs as a language of the components of intrapsychicdynamics and psychosocial relations gives it the symbolic power to manipulateone’s emotions and sense of self. These beliefs and the processes they evoke canprovide resources for coping with stress because they are mediated by phyloge-netically older forms of communication regarding emotions, self, and relationswith others. Shamanistic practices engage this emotional communication pro-cesses using presumptions about the ability of spiritual agents to affect well-being.While the specific properties of spirits may reflect predominantly culturalbeliefs, there are a number of aspects of spirits that constitute neurognosticstructures, universal properties of how humans experience the spirit world(see Chapter 6).Wesselman (2008) provided a view of other underlying commonalities inspirit concepts, a synthetic perspective on the endogenous views of the soul foundcross-culturally. He proposed a matrix of soul concepts rather than a single typeof soul or spirit, providing a diversity of models of the self. Wesselman noted thatmany spiritual traditions have proposed a triune model of the self and its souls,including the Greek philosopher Pythagoras (physical body, mental psyche, andimmortal spiritual soul), Sigmund Freud (id/it, ego, and superego) and Carl Jung(subconscious, conscious, and superconscious). This tripartite, or triune, concep-tion of the self is more explicitly spiritual in traditions worldwide, reflecting whatmay be an inherent patterning of the human mind.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES205"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Basing himself in his long study of the Hawaiian Kahuna practices, Wesselmancharacterized three aspects of personal spirit in terms of1. An immortal ancestral aspect of the self known in the Western traditions asthe higher self or “oversoul.” This powerful beneficent force maintainscontact with our experience, carrying our accumulated knowledge of pastlives for intuitive guidance and conveying a tranquility and peace throughour breath. Wesselman noted that a connection of breath and spirit is foundacross languages. This “upperworld” essence conveys the essential aspects ofour character, a divine breath that conveys the force of life arriving in thebody at birth, where it encounters the body soul.2. The body soul, a biological field that is derived from the spiritual and ener-getic properties of the mother and father passed on through reproduction.This biological entity is structured by theoversoul to produce an effectivemelding of ancestral, paternal, and maternal features in the personality.Conceptualized as the unconscious or subconscious in Western psychology,this aspect of the self is in charge of the organismic functions of the body.Functioning as the memory system, the body soul acquires the effects ofour experiences, learned behaviors, and emotions. This seat of our emotionallife guides our personal relations, desires, and dreams, and provides the por-tal through which shamans interact with the spirit world. Functioning as aninner healer, it operates on many mechanisms, including physical behavior,the genetic code, and the energetic fields of the body. The body soul alsofunctions in the capacities of mind and reason, using the senses to mediateour relationships with the external world and following the patternsestablished by the mental soul.3. The mental soul, our intellectual capacities, reflecting Freud’s concept of theego. This source of our intentionality, rational mind, and creative impulses isthe decision maker. The mental soul’s capacities are derived from the effectsof learning and socialization experiences, and are closely tied to its ability tomodulate emotional reactions.Wesselman proposed that what we conceptualize as self is a matrix based on theinteractions of these three spirit/soul dimensions. The interactions betweenthe body soul and its emotional components with the mental soul and its direc-tives are a major area for emotional disorders. If we are fortunate, the oversouland its wisdom provide the guidance necessary for a balance between the two andthe social context in which they form and must function.Spirits and Emotional Well-BeingThe spirit beliefs with which shamans work structure emotional life throughaffecting fears, stress, anxieties, and frustrations. These emotional dynamics,which are contributory to disease, provide a general mechanism through whichshamanic healing can enhance health through their reduction. Religiouslydefined meanings and experiences provide important contributions to cognitive206SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"labeling and the interpretations individuals make of their state. Proudfoot andShaver (1997) noted that religion provides powerful attributions to actorsbeyond individual control; however, the attribution system of shamanismestablishes relationships with the spiritual world that are subject to one’s control,indicating a psychodynamic different from the dependency dynamics attributedto religion. This is exemplified in the guardian spirit complex.Shamanistic healing has other effects on emotional processes in elicitingrepressed memories, restructuring memories of painful experiences, and resolv-ing conflict through symbolic ritual processes. Catharsis—the remembering,re-experiencing, and expression of repressed emotional memories with painfulattachments—is ritually structured to reduce stressful impacts on the individual.Shamanic therapies create psychological and physical healing through confession,which relieves conflicts and repressions and provides for expression of uncon-scious concerns. Social knowledge of transgressions can exacerbate stress reac-tions through the social disapproval and interpersonal rejection expressed byothers. Confession is often followed by social forgiveness, which can reduce socialstress and reestablish harmonious interpersonal relations.Shamanistic healing typically provides an explanation of misfortune in waysthat minimize personal guilt and reduce emotional distress for the patient byattributing causation of illness—and, hence, responsibility—to others: spiritsand sorcerers. A typical shamanistic treatment is the ritual removal of an objectintruded into the body by a sorcerer. This can be understood from a psychiatricperspective as releasing a “negative introject,” a critical self-perspective derivedfrom internalization of an attitude from a significant other. The view of guilt interms of conflicts between id impulses (considered here as processes of thepaleomammalian brain) and the superego ideals (internalized standards forself-evaluation derived from significant others and enculturation) suggests thatshamanistic healing mediates paleomammalian brain and neomammalian brainprocesses, the interactions between our innate emotional and socialized selves.Rituals may also be used to evoke negative or unpleasant emotions (e.g.,anger, fear) or memories, suggesting that shamanistic healers used the sameprinciples of modern psychotherapy in enabling their patients to consciouslyconfront their fears (Walsh 1990). The treatment of anxiety is linked acrossWestern behavioral and psychopharmacological therapies in their commonaction of desensitization. In behavior therapies,the most common method oftherapy used is exposure to feared objects, providing a learning desensitizationbased on a realization of one’s own self-control. Although the effectiveness ofpharmacotherapies is limited because cessation of medication often results inrelapse, the behavioral desensitization becomes essentially irreversible onceestablished. The treatment strategies for anxiety disorders focus on exposure tothreatening, feared, or avoided objects, often incorporating significant others.Shamanic healing processes provide exposure to fearful stimuli, with the patient’sfears evoked by songs and dramatic enactments. The clients’ active role in engag-ing the images of their fears promotes catharsis and permits reduction of theimpact of the feared objects and previous traumas.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES207"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The attitudinal aspects of the relationship between cognitive and emotionalprocesses are central to the effects of religious healing. A fundamental role ofreligion is in the shaping of cognitive and emotional processes that form thebases for attitudes, the categorization of something along some good/bad evalu-ative dimension. Attitudes controlled by automatic processes may occurindependently of higher level processing, reflecting the automaticity of affectiveresponses. These responses reflect the anatomical basis of the emotional reactivebasis described by Ledoux (1996), who found how little the cognitive processesmay be able to control the biologically based emotional reactions. In contrastto the lack of cognitive control over emotions, the outcome of ritual processesengage control of emotional reactions. When individuals are operating understress or when circumstances defy conventional explanations, it is more likelythat the automatic emotional processes will take over in the evaluative processes.Rituals are used to guide these reactions towards adaptive states, shaping what isperceived at emotional levels. Situational, interpersonal, and other conceptualinfluences are part of ritual management that may determine whether—andwhich—cognitive or emotive processes are given priority. These emotionalpriorities and expectations are key aspects of our endogenous healing processes.Spirits as Symbols in Endogenous Healing ProcessShamanistic healing shares with biomedicine and all forms of healing a commonbasis in the use of symbols to evoke healing responses. All healing occurs withincultural systems that symbolically manage illness through classification of condi-tions and determination of therapeutic practices to manage them. The meaningsgiven by cultural symbols affect physiological responses through the attachmentsand evaluations they engender. Kleinman (1980) referred to this as “medicine’ssymbolic reality,” which involves the evocation of psychophysiological responsesthrough linkages among social events, cultural meanings, and attachments. Thesesymbolic effects produce physiological responses and elicit endogenous healingresponses such as placebo effects.Symbolic effects initiate endogenous healing functions prior to diagnosis,resulting from how the person responds psychophysiologically to the interactionwith the healing system. Ethnomedical systems diagnose—label, classify,and evaluate—illness, structuring the personal experience of illness through thecharacteristics assigned (severity, responsibility, etiology, likely outcome, etc.).Classification of illness constitutes a part of the healing process and can reducestress and anxiety and their detrimental physiological consequences by addressinguncertainty, transforming an unknown condition into events that are under-standable to and manageable by the social group. The act of classifying an illnessis a form of symbolic treatment through the effects of cognitive, personal, andsocial mechanisms on emotions. Kleinman characterized healing as occurringalong a symbolic pathway of words, feelings, values, expectations, and beliefsthrough which cultural events elicit affective and physiological processes. Psycho-somatic and sociosomatic correlates—whereour personal and social circum-stances affect physiological responses—are implicit in all healing.208SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"This symbolic model provides a framework for explicating the central role ofspirits in healing processes. Spirits conceptsare cultural symbols that have avariety of roles in eliciting psychophysiological responses that produce healing.This is based in relationships established through socialization of feelings andtheir linkage to physiological responses. This linkage is accomplished throughlanguage and other symbolic systems, which produce psychosomatic and socio-somatic effects by the association of symbols with physiological processesthrough affective/emotional evaluations.PsychoneuroimmunologyThe field of psychoneuroimmunology2(PNI) derived from findings that immunesystem processes are affected by the organism’s responses in adaptation to the envi-ronment. PNI emerged from recognition of the ability of symbols, personal expec-tations, social relations and, above all, stress, to have effects on immune systemresponses and health. The interactions are not strictly material, but involve theorganism’s adaptations through cognitive models, psychological states, and socialrelations. PNI research has investigated interactions among the central nervoussystem (CNS), endocrine system, and immune system (Lyon 1993), particularly,how symbols tune the relationship between the nervous and immune systems(Varela 1997). PNI shows that the immune system is affected by the interactionsbetween psychological and physiological processes, particularly the ways in whichthought, feeling, and behavior interact in disease processes (Lyon 1993, 77).Because of the social basis of immune system functioning, health and diseaseprocesses are affected by the interactions among social relations, emotions, andphysiological processes. These interactions between the organism’s social andbiological levels are based in subjective emotional experiences and sense of self.Immunological responses involve relationships between biological and sociallevels of being, an interaction of individual physiology and social psychology thatis the context for effects at cellular levels (Lyon 1993). Lyon suggested this contextinvolves human emotions, which are both biological and cognitive, and produceboth disease and healing. Interpersonal interactions and social experiences affectthe immune system via intervening influences of emotions that involve individu-ally felt meanings and their somatic responses (Lyon, 85).The immune system operates as one of the most fundamental adaptations ofthe organism to the environment, a system that detects and responds in protectiveways to pathogens—germs and other toxic threats from the environment. Theimmune system is one of the body’s most complex systems, responding to anarray of pathogens that threaten the body—microorganisms such as viruses andbacteria, fungi, allergens, and toxins (Hirsch 2004, 92). When these pathogenspenetrate outer defenses in the skin, mucous membranes, and digestive systems,the immune system responds with the production of antibodies. Immune reac-tions are elicited by the detection of foreign proteins, distinct from the organism’sown. When a foreign antigen is detected, the body produces memory cells that areprepared to combat this pathogen if it reoccurs in the organism. The immuneresponse includes specialized white blood cells called leukocytes, includingSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES209"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"lymphocytes (B and T cells), monocytes, and granulocytes (Hirsch, 93). When a Blymphocyte is triggered by the recognition of an antigen, it stimulates the produc-tion of antibodies (immunoglobulins), which have a wide range of specializedfunctions in combating entities that are foreign to the organism.A systems perspective is necessary to understand how symbols bring aboutphysiological changes in the body and how effects are communicated acrossdomains of mind and body. Lyon proposed that these communicative functionsof the immune system produce an “immunosemiotics” that involves “biologicalmeaning” based in immune system cognitive functions of discrimination, infer-ence, and memory that provide the basis for an “immunological self.” Theimmune system can be conceptualized as a sensory system within which thewhite blood cells function as “messenger molecules” for communication amongthe CNS, immune, and endocrine systems (Lyon 1993). Peptides found in boththe immune and neuroendocrine systems provide the basis for signaling theimmune system in response to “noncognitive stimuli” of not-self— such asviruses and bacteria. The immune system’s sensory function enables it to relayinformation to the neuroendocrine system and initiate physiological changes.CNS responses to emotional stimuli changehormone levels that affect theimmune system as “information molecules” that act on the immune system indi-rectly through hormones and directly through neurotransmitters (Lyon 1993).Varela (1997) characterized the immune system’s structure and functions as a“second brain,” providing a self-regulating control of the body’s responses to theenvironment. The immune system has organs distributed throughout the body thatmanufacture or store its cells (lymphocytes, B cells, T cells of the thymus, thespleen, and the lymphatic system) that adapt through learning and memory.Through the interaction of mind and emotions with the nervous system, ourpsychological conditions have influences on health, as discussed above in the stressresponses. This provides mechanisms for interaction between the CNS and theimmune system. CNS response to stress causes the release of hormones (glucocor-ticoids) that interact with the lymphatic system, stimulating the immune system torelease lymphocytes and immunotransmitters that act directly on neurons of thelimbic system (paleomammalian brain), the center of emotions and self. Hirschcharacterized the brain-immune system communication underlying the immunesystem response as involving the sympathetic-adrenomedullary system and thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system, both of which are paleomammalianbrain regions aroused by the SNS fight-or flight response. This activation triggersthe endocrine system of glands to release a wide range of chemical messengers.Hormone receptors are found throughout the immune system, as well as in theorgans and neurotransmitter systems. Their interaction across these differentsystems enables hormones to play a vital role in communication across self, body,social context, emotions, meaning, and immune system responses.SelfThe immune system functions as a level of the self, a system that has the functionof distinguishing the “not-self” at the level of cellular recognition of foreign210SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"entities (Lyon 2003; Wilce 2003). The concept of the self is central to theories ofPNI because the most basic response made by the immune system is a responseto the presence of an outside entity, something that is foreign to the organism,something that is “not-self.” PNI approaches have traditionally assumed thatimmunological processes work through a precultural level of the self involvingthe body and its emotions, a primordial aspect of personal identity that includesa sense of the body and its internal processes and its emotional relations to familyand significant others in society. The immunological self is not the rational,language-based thinking mind, but, rather, a much deeper embodied self ofbehavior, habits, nonverbal communication, and social and emotional dynamicsthat are the foundation of our participation in the social world. This behaviorallevel is a semiotic (meaning) system shared with other animals in our embodi-ment and expression of meaning and intention through behavior.This body-based, preverbal system is the basis for a metalanguage of communi-cation within the organism and across its verbal, behavioral, neural, and immunesystems (Wilce 2003). The innately structured metaphors of the body found cross-culturally and throughout cognitive domains is the basis of this self. Wilce usedthe termsomatosocial, “body-social,” to expand on the bases of the concept of socio-somatic, where social relations affect the interaction between mind and body. Soma-tosocial describes the recognition that the body is prior to the conception of thesocial and is a metaphoric basis from which we understand social relations (forexample, he is the “head” of the group; she is the “heart” of the organization).Bodies are natural systems of meaning, but they also acquire their signifi-cance from local meanings and circumstances. The material bases of the symbolicand social world impose cultural concepts on the body. Mimesis is the core of thesymbolic systems of the body, with its ability to act being the most fundamentalrepresentational system and basis formetaphor. Mimesis, the body’s ability toimitate and represent through action, is the common basis of both somatic andsymbolic levels of reality.The level of representation of mimesis is manifested in our bodies as habits, theindividual behavioral patterns produced by conditioning the lower centers of thebrain into typical response patterns, an engagement of bodily processes and associ-ated psychological reactions. Habit also provides an emotional engagement, with asense of control and security derived from the regularity of patterns of experience.These reflect conditioned effects, derived from classic conditioning and associa-tional learning, and in which personal experiences and social conditions are sym-bolically and physically incorporated into development of body responses.These and other learned meanings affect emotions, morale, mood, and expe-riences of depression and powerlessness. These bodily expressions of internalstates are the most fundamental aspects of our relationships to the outside world.Body metaphors have the power to express meanings by their natural ability tomediate between the sensory domains of felt experience and the verbal domainsof expression, employing analogical reasoning processes that use the body as acommon template for integrating felt experiences and social reality. Culture pro-vides the social context in which the metaphors of our “bodyminds” are engagedby the social context that defines their meaning.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES211"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Social ContextWilce pointed to the central role of social and cultural factors in immune systems,which reflects the intimate effects of our social relations and the symbolic expres-sions found in society on our immunological system functions. Social context isfundamental to the emotional processes of the self that integrate the effects ofsocial life within bodily processes. PNI emerged from recognition of the vital roleof not only psychological aspects but also social interactions in the functioning ofthe immune system. Our immune functioning is affected by our relative socialstatus in society, making the hierarchy of social relations a part of the systemiceffects on the health of individuals.Lyon (2003) proposed that the relationships of social life to the immunesystem are mediated through the habitual effects of conditioning on our behav-iors, producing a mimetic enactment of personal and cultural patterns, whichprovide the basis for emotional contagion, the linkages between social life andbodily processes. Kirmayer (2003) noted the cultural dynamics of sociophysio-logical responses, how the meaning of individual experiences has effects onphysiological responses. These sociosomatic-psychosomatic interactions engageemotional dispositions to act through which cultural specifics shape the biologicalresponses of emotion. Lyon noted that the role of emotions as mediators betweensocial relations and our experienced body makes them natural representations ofthe processes in the broader social system. This makes cultural metaphors of thebody relevant to management of our emotions.Emotional Empathy and ContagionEmotions are the representations of how thebody subjectively experiences theself and the social world through their interrelations in intimate social networks.Our emotional capacities involve self and physiological mechanisms for adjust-ment to the social environment. It is through the derivation of emotions frompersonal experiences of social relations that our individual psychophysiologicaldynamics are intimately lined to the social world. The symbolic processes andsocial relations are consequently fundamental to elicitation of emotions and inthe production of emotional empathy, a process that transfers experiences fromone body to another. This emotional contagion is based in unconscious imitativebodily processes, derived from the bodily dispositions produced by attachment,where the integration of body, emotions, and the social awareness of others firstoccurred (mirror neurons also trigger these homologous responses). Emotionalcontagion is concerned with the co-occurrence of the same emotions amongmembers of a group together in a setting. Across species, emotional contagionis based in imitative processes, including mimicry and other behaviors that placeanimals in attunement or synchrony. It is a multilevel phenomenon influenced byphysiological, behavioral, and social levels and their respective meanings.PNI theories consider the meaning of events to play a role in the regulationof the immune system. Kirmayer noted that there are many forms of meaning,including forms of cognitive, affective, behavioral, and social representation.These provide the bases for a variety of feedback loops between the psychosocial212SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"dynamics of life and the functioning of the immune system (Kirmayer, Lyon).Some contributions involve unconditioned effects, natural biological responsesof the body such as the grief from loss of a family member, marital conflict, anddisruption of mother-child relations. Most have learned components, however,including conditioned effects from socializations and learned systems of meaningembodied in metaphors.Symbolic Healing through MetaphorShamanistic healers’ ritual activities embody many symbols that express concernsof the sufferer and of society at large, with treatment processes manifestingcultural conceptions of emotional conditions and social relations. Shamanisticactivities construct a mythic world and symbolically manipulate it to elicit andtransform emotional experiences for the patient. Dow (1986) described theseuniversal aspects of symbolic healing andthe psychological processes throughwhich symbols affect mind and body. These psychological processes involve creat-ing an experiential reality through ritual. The healer ritually enacts and elicits acommonly held mythic system and interprets the patient’s condition within thatsystem. The attachment of the patient’s emotions to previously internalizedmythic systems of meaning allows the healer to then transform the patient emo-tionally through manipulating the symbols that correspond to the self systems ofthe patient. A cure is produced through remodeling the self within the patternsof the mythic world, using social drama to transform psychosocial and physiologi-cal dynamics.Dow (1986) characterized the mechanisms of symbolic healing in terms ofthe relationships among the hierarchies of living systems. Personality and itsproblems are part of a hierarchy of interrelated systems extending from theorganic and somatic levels through the self and social systems. Although eachlevel constitutes a complete system (e.g., body, self, personality), each systemhas parameters based in the other systems. For example, while personality is notorganized in biological terms, physical illness can transform one’s personality.Social conditions such as job loss can transform our experience of our physicalwell-being. These interrelationships across levels of the human system providethe basis for systemic self-regulation and causal effects. In shamanic healing, sym-bols provided by myth and embodied in ritual communicate to the self systemand the somatic. The self system shares the unconscious thought processing ofthe body (somatic level) and exerts its influences through interpretation of affec-tive significance of symbols at the biological level and their significance for theself system. The transaction of emotion in the self system allows healing to occurthrough unconscious and somatic processes elicited by symbolic communication.The generalized link of self and body through emotions enable shamanistictherapies to catharsize (emotionally release), transfer, and transact emotionsand other attachments. These emotional processes are reinforced through sugges-tion, persuasion, catharsis, social restructuring, psychodrama, and therapeuticrelationships. Emotions constitute basic integrative control functions, providinghigher levels of the organism with a summarization of complex processesSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES213"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"occurring at lower levels (Dow 1986, 64). Emotions can play this fundamentallinking role because meaning determine patterns of physiological elicitation withinformation from personal, social, and cultural levels. Dow suggested that sym-bolic healing is based on a human capacity for interpersonal communicationderived from a prior human capacity to communicate with one’s self throughemotion. This intrapersonal biological control and communication mechanismwas extended into later evolutionary control systems based on symbolic systemsand language. Consequently, symbols can reciprocally use the emotional-meaning system to affect biological processes and produce a cure. A primarymechanism of this symbolic communication is through metaphor.Metaphoric Processes in HealingKirmayer (1993) developed a general theory of symbolic healing examining howmetaphoric language creates meaning and personal changes. Kirmayer (162)characterized meaning in terms of the imaginative relationship of thoughts andfeelings; metaphor engages the power involved in “thinking of one thing in termsof another” in the interaction among sensory, affective, and cognitive elements(Kirmayer, 172). Metaphors create and convey meanings or connotations derivedfrom the juxtaposition of images and sensory and affective information thatreshapes experiences. Myth is a key tool in linking these processes.Myth and archetype are basic to ritual healing because they link biologicaland experiential meanings across the false dichotomy of objective and subjectiveknowledge (Kirmayer 173). Kirmayer suggested that myth, metaphor, and arche-type represent distinct levels of meaning that are linked in the interactions ofbody, imagination, and society, providing mechanisms of symbolic healing. Mythimposes a structure on thought and behavior, and consequently on the bodythrough their ability to evoke and reorder experiences. Kirmayer (1993) suggestedthat metaphors provide healing by bridging the archetypal and mythic levels ofexperience, structuring conceptual domains through evoking strong sensory/affective associations. The healing efficacy of myths derives from their ability tounite within a narrative the different levels of human experience. Myths still worktoday when they can be interpreted in ways that tap into the patient’s archetypalstructures by communicating empathy in meanings derived from their sensoryand affective qualities. Metaphor becomes more complex and sophisticated withverbal expression, but earlier levels of meaning-making continue to contributeto abstract understanding through an integrated grounding of thought andaction in sensorimotor experience and social life.Metaphor bridges presentational and representational levels of meaning withimagetic metaphors that convey meaning in both domains. The meaning ofmetaphors is reciprocally shared by the representational systems and the lowerlevels of sensory affective processing. These metaphors underlie the processes ofthought and action, enabling cognition to drive physiological responses by usingmetaphors to evoke bodily experience. The effects of metaphors are derived fromthe immediacy of bodily felt experiences grounded in archetypal patterns shapedby cultural and social factors. The healer uses symbols specific to the audience,214SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"with the ritual manipulation integrating different aspects of the self. For instance,when Christian healers use the metaphor of the “loving heart of Jesus,” this reso-nates with their audiences’ own hearts and emotions of love as well as the naturalmetaphoric properties of the heart.Kirmayer addressed multiple mechanisms of symbolic healing, characterizingthe healing efficacy of psychoanalytic approaches as derived from the revelation ofpreviously warded-off truth. The symbols of psychoanalysis may heal because theyreveal underlying dynamics and provide a balance among different aspects ofthe self. Healing may occur because the metaphorization of distress provides theperson with resources for managing self and emotions. Meaning is derived fromthe coordination of sign systems and symbols, an internal logic derived from therelationships in a total system that allows rituals and symbols to unconsciouslyaffect individual thoughts, feelings, and conditions. Ritual efficacy derives fromthe psychophysiological effects of metaphor, including its ability to evoke nonver-bal processes and responses. The physical and psychological associations of socialcontext and symbolic actions produce a biological psychology through whichsymbolic cognition is grounded in the body.The universal aspects of symbolic healing in Dow’s (1986) model involved theestablishment of a generalized mythic world, the persuasion of the patient to par-ticularize his or her problems within that mythic world, the healer attaching thepatient’s emotions to the mythic world symbols, and the manipulation of thosesymbols for assisting emotional transactions. Kirmayer suggested that the verbsestablish,persuade,attach, andmanipulateinvolve processes that are not exploredwithin the structuralist approach. We must understand instead the process ofphysiological and psychological levels, including nonsemiotic social and biologicalprocesses that produce healing through meaning. This meaning of metaphor is notjust within the symbolic realm, but also in terms of the physical body and society:“Metaphor theory does this by insisting on three levels to action and discourse: themythic level of coherent narratives; the archetypal level of bodily-givens; and themetaphoric level of temporary constructions.” The processes of myth, metaphor,and archetype represent the social, psychological, and bodily domains, respectively(Kirmayer, 175). Metaphor links body and society through myth and the archetypesof the body. By archetype, Kirmayer meant processes that are rooted in the nervoussystem and presented in images that are subjectively compelling experiences appear-ing before reflection. These archetypal bases of thought are grounded in physicalactions and the body’s motor system. Archetypes arise from the interaction of thebody with social relations that constitute a universal substrate of human experience;these are the neurognostic foundations of consciousness—“knowing how,” relatedto images of the body’s actions (see Chapter 3).Biosocialization and Symbolic PenetrationThe neurophenomenological or biogenetic structuralist perspectives (Laughlin,McManus, and d’Aquili 1992) illustrate how myths, metaphors, rituals, andsymbols can affect health. These mechanisms involve socialization processes thatsymbolically canalize physiological development and habitualize and automatizeSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES215"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"physiological responses to symbols. The development of the organism’s geneticpotentials requires symbolic input into the developmental canalization, a habit-ualization of physiological responses. For humans, this input includes the cul-tural environment and language. Symbolic effects on physiological levels areinherent aspects of the organism and its functioning and activities becauseprocessing of environmental stimuli and their significance is fundamentally sym-bolic. The symbolic process is fundamental to the development of models basic tocognitive development of models mediating the neural organization of experi-ence. In its most fundamental form, perception is a symbolic process, a represen-tation of present stimuli in terms of symbolic memories of previous experiences.Experience, development, and socialization involve entrainment, the linking ofneurons into networks. The brain’s (and consciousness’s) developmental sociali-zation is through entrainment of neurons into networks constructing cognizedmodels of the operational environment. The networks mediate the cognizedworld and present the symbolic model into which environmental information isassimilated. The brain’s preeminent function is to optimize adaptation throughsymbol systems that mediate between input (senses) and output (behavior).Enculturated humans no longer experience the world directly, but through thelearned symbolic associations. We thereby experience the meaning of symbolsrather than the actual world. For instance, when asked to put a piece of sterilerubber looking like feces in their mouth, most people refuse and are disgusted,even though they know if is just rubber. Our emotions are driven by the symbolicinterpretation, which outweighs our actual knowledge of what the object is.Fundamental to biological development is the repeated entrainment of net-works of neurons stimulated in response to specific environmental conditions,including the symbols (such as words) that are associated with those conditions.The associated responses develop a neurological canal (a creode) which forms inrepetitively responding to and modeling specific stimuli. Canalization processesinclude cultural association patterns and their linkages across behavior, emo-tions, and cognition, an associative chain within a hierarchy of specific and globalphysiological reactions (e.g., emotions). The canalizing process functions in indi-vidual development and social adaptation, and in the acquisition of perceptualdiscrimination, motor activity, conceptual differentiation, symbolic processes,and patterns of association. These adaptations produce adaptive coordinationamong members of a species in commonalities in self and world view.These common relationship between cognition and the nervous systemallows it to be activated through ritual in symbolic associative processes. Percep-tion, cognition, and action are grounded in common neuropsychological andsymbolic processes. A symbol may evoke any neural network or neurocognitivemodel with which it has been entrained, including autonomic and endocrine sys-tems, brain structures, emotions, and abstract ideas. This is symbolic penetration,the effects of the neural system mediating a symbolic precept on associated physi-cal systems. Symbolically evoking and entraining associated physiological systemsallows meaning to influence physiological processes. That is why it is a crime toyell “fire” in a crowded theater; that symbol will evoke traumatic responses inter-nally (stress) and behaviorally (chaos).216SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Shamanistic Healing as Ritual Symbolic PenetrationSymbolic healing processes operate on numerous associational patterns and theirmediation through both the body and the ego. Laughlin et al. (1992) characterizedthe ego as a neural network that separates, differentiates, and integrates the envi-ronment while maintaining self-organization and adaptation to the operationalenvironment. Outside of ego experience are automatized structures from earlierdevelopmental stages and repressed or latent material, such as the genotypic andphenotypic progenitors of the ego. The ego tends to deny these structures thatfunction outside of consciousness, although these complexes affect the ego andother structures of consciousness. Symbolic penetration created by ritual canevoke these structures and their intentionalities and can operate on them, mediat-ing and transforming them outside of awareness. Symbolic healing processes canaffect psychodynamic structures, destructuring the ego, evoking latent aspects ofthe self, transforming socioemotional aspects of the psyche, or activating andelevating deep structures into consciousness. Symbols may produce a cure byreelevating, transforming, and integrating latent or suppressed neural networks.The neurophenomenological perspective provides an understanding ofshamanistic healing processes as producing cures through entraining deep levelsof neurocognitive organization. These repressed structures can produce conflict,allowing re-integration of this material into the conscious network to reworkthe individual’s experience of self and world, including self-understanding andautonomic balance. Shamanistic healing synchronizes individual and collectiveconsciousness through using rituals to control phases of consciousness, synchro-nizing the individual with the collective cognized environment of the group.Shamanism epitomizes these principles of ritual healing involving a “theaterof the mind” (Laughlin et al. 1992), the use of symbols as penetrating agents thatentrain the individual’s neurocognitive organization through myth, symbol, andritual which induce experiences and interprets them for the participants. Mythand ritual behaviors include symbols that bridge iconic and verbal levels byincluding metaphors that cross domains of meaning. Myth serves as a means ofmolding, stabilizing, and integrating the patients’ experiences through givingthem meaning. Myth provides the symbolic framework for understandings thattranscend the ego, permitting the integration of the ego into wider structures ofconsciousness. This integration may result in profound changes in the individualbecause the symbols are entrained with physiological processes associated withbasic emotions; social attachments; needs of the self; a sense of comfort, securityand certainty; and of fears, anxieties, and other psychodynamic processes thathave effects on physiological processes.Shamanistic Healing and the SelfRole theory is central to understanding shamanic development and healing, as wellas the general social psychology of religious healing. Peters and Price-Williams’s(1981) experiential analysis of shamanism provided insight into the therapeuticpotentials present in role-taking and development of the self. The differentSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES217"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"shamanistic traditions—shamanism, mediumistic possession, and meditativetraditions—all engage role and self-development. These therapeutic processes arefocused on mending self, particularly emotions and the relationship of the self toothers. Development of the self involves the integration of other people’s roles intoone’s personality by adoption of others’ formulas or scripts for self and behavior.These processes of role-taking provide mechanisms through which personal devel-opment occurs, including relations with “divine others” or “sacred others” (Holm1997; Pandian 1997). This role-taking through symbolic communication enablesone to treat spirits as social others and incorporate their qualities as aspects of one’sown identity. Identification with the social other in the spirit world’s others providesthe bases through which ritual healing practices have the power to transform a per-son’s life, particularly emotions and identity. Spirits provide a variety of roles fordefining the qualities of the self and adapting to the social world, providing modelsfor personal development in the spirit world-symbol systems. Spirit models expandthe human capacity for modeling the self by using ideal others from mythology.Soul Loss as Shamanic IllnessThe self aspects of shamanic illness are exemplified in soul loss, which was char-acterized by Achterberg (1985) as one involving an injury to the core or essenceof the person’s being. Ingerman (1991, 4) similarly characterized soul loss as“losing crucial parts of ourselves that provide life and vitality.” This injury toone’s essence is manifested as despair and reflects a disharmony in feelings ofbelonging and connection with others. Soul is characterized as constituting ourvital essence, the “seat of the emotions, feeling, or sentiments” (Ingerman, 11).Soul loss is from trauma that causes some of our vital essence to separate in orderto escape the impact. This separated part or aspect of ourselves carries with it theexperiences that are then denied to our consciousness. The return of souls lostearlier in life allows the ego and the body to move forward instead of being emo-tionally stuck in that time and place where the loss occurred.The recovery of these split-off parts of one’s self and healing this loss can beachieved by a community ritual. Ingerman suggested that there is great power inanother person witnessing the return of the soul. The person’s community or socialsupport network plays a vital role in the recovery and healing processes. An out-come of this is an experience ofcommunitas—a recognition of the essential bondsthat humans have with others. Turner’s (1969) work illustrated the fundamentalimportance of this transformational experience of communitas in providing ameans of bonding members of society together in recognition of their dependenceon one another. Peters (1989) characterized communitas as an existential experi-ence that transforms the individual in relationship to the transpersonal as well asto worldly and social life. Shamans elicit feelings of communitas in transformationalexperiences in which the boundaries of self are dissolved into a state of unity con-sciousness. The unity experiences and the resultant identity with others and all lifeprovide the basis for the development of self in an integrative style of personalityand an ethos based on service to others. Central psychodynamic effects of shaman-istic healing evoke changes in the patient’s self through the healer’s projection and218SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"elicitation of models of development (Laughlin et al. 1992). Shamanic projectioninvolves positively projecting a more advanced state of development into anotherperson, based on the unconscious transference of control of the individual’s inten-tional processes to a powerful “master.”Laughlin, McManus, Rubinstein, and Shearer (1986) suggested that shamanicrituals provide greater control over changes of consciousness that enhance accessto transpersonal (or integrative) levels of consciousness through the replacementof ego-centered consciousness with a variety of neurognostic structures. Symbolicprocesses produce changes in consciousness and provide new frameworks forinterpreting one’s experiences. The penetration and evocation of neurognosticstructures through symbols can enhance developmental processes by bypassingexisting cognitive structures that inhibit development and growth.Shamanic practices produce an experience of an active participation inthese transpersonal experiences, a “waking dream” analogous to Jung’s transcen-dent function, “a uniting of conscious and unconscious ways of knowing thatleads to self-actualization, or ‘individuation’ ” (Peters and Price-Williams 1981,406). These experiences induce transformation of self. Peters (1989) suggestedthat an underlying similarity common to shamanic, yogic, and other meditativetraditions is found in the transformational structures that involve acquisition ofa spiritual identity used to change relationships to one’s social and physicalworld.Healing in Shamanic JourneyingAlthough well-being is related to development of attachment, this can create a falseself that involves identifications to please caretakers, producing dissociation fromaspects of self that they disapprove of. This begins a psychological abandonment ofthe true self that manifests later in life in anger, frustration, and loss of access to one’sown creative potentials (Gagan 1998). Shamanic journeying can heal these develop-mental traumas and reestablish contact with one’s true self through “poweranimals” that represent dissociated aspects of the self. These power animal relationscan nurture the traumatized aspects of the self and provide important substituteattachment experiences. Journeying allows a reframing of early traumas, particularlythose that are still dissociated. Power animals encountered in shamanic journeyingmay be recovered as manifestations of “lost souls,” reactivating lost potentials anddissociated aspects of self. Incorporating power animals can provide healingthrough their integration into the self, bringing qualities and characteristics that helpaddress shortcomings, particularly deficits in personality development. It is the“journey time” that provides an opportunity for this work.Achterberg (1985) analyzed the shaman’s use of imagery to impact health interms of a “pre-verbal imagery,” in which imagination acts directly on the physi-cal substrate, including tissues, organs, and cells. This type of communicationfunctions outside of deliberation and consciousness, a capacity that evolved priorto language. Achterberg proposed a second type of healing imagery involvingtranspersonal symbols that are universal and act on the collective unconscious(or neurognostic structures). The symbolic encounter in visionary experiencesSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES219"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"involves the unconscious and transcendent aspects of consciousness that providea means for manipulation of and integration of the psyche.The roles of internal imagery in cognition involve “metaphoric predication”between domains of experience and other forms of information processing. Thisimagetic capability engages the same brain capabilities and levels of informationprocessing within the visual system (Baars 1997). Visual images link the somaticand the cognitive levels through analogical processes. The inner images attunethe patient to the levels of psychobiological communication where images playa central role in muscular control. The effects of conscious images are widelydistributed throughout the brain, which enables them to drive the unconsciouscontrol centers of muscles (Baars 1997). Images represent goals that recruit andcoordinate a wide range of unconscious systems to achieve goals. Images providefor voluntary influence over the autonomic nervous system. “Imagery seems to bethe only conscious modality that can trigger autonomic process” (Baars 1997,141). Threatening images evoke the fight-or-flight response (SNS activation)and pleasant images stimulate the PNS’s relaxation response.Spirit illnesses, possession, and illness due to malevolent action of spirits canbe viewed in psychological terms as a negative introject, a negative self-belief thatthe person has internalized. These unconsciously internalized ideas may havemajor impacts on individual psychodynamics and physiological processes. Ritualmanipulation of spirit beliefs elicits the associated neurocognitive structures andthe variety of physiological, psychosocial, and psychophysiological processes withwhich they have been entrained. The reintegration of these lower structurespenetrates upward, integrating personal conditions (feelings) within the mythicsymbol structures expressed in ritual to evoke these experiences. Reciprocalassimilation then permits the integration of the ego into new patterns by rituallyelevating unconscious neurognostic structures and integrating them within thecognized environment expressed in the shaman’s cosmology and mythology(Laughlin et al. 1992).Jung regarded shamanic imagery to be confrontation with one’s own uncon-scious psychological complexes. This supports a process of individuation or indi-vidual psychological growth. Complexes represent similar phenomenaconceptualized in both psychiatric and spiritualist terms. Complexes are an organ-ized dynamic of perception and behavior that are split off or dissociated fromaspects of the person’s normal personality and social identity. These “splintered-off,” or dissociated, aspects of the personality (such as manifested in multiple per-sonality disorders) are mechanisms thatallow for the functioning of disownedaspects of one’s own capabilities and characteristics or for the projection and mani-festation of one’s unconscious potentials. Shamanic practices symbolically inducetherapeutic transformations by using the spirit world concepts to structure interac-tions among dissociated complexes of the individual and to integrate them withinboth collective social patterns and innate individual psychodynamics. Dramatic rit-uals produce psychodramatic transactions (e.g., see Jelik 1982) that restructure indi-vidual psychobiological homeostasis, psychodynamics, and psychosocial relationsbetween individuals and their community.220SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Possession Illness and TherapyThe classical treatments of possession have used a wide range of procedures forexorcism of invading spirits, including incantation, exhortation, and a variety ofpurgatives and punitive measures designed to drive the presumptive possessingspirit away, including beatings, starvation, and near poisonings of the patient.Ward (1989b, 135) pointed out that anthropologists’ reports of therapeuticbenefits suggested that there is some efficacy in their treatments, which are likelythe influence of “psychological factors and processes, such as perception, belief,expectancy, motivation, role playing, demand characteristics, and reinforce-ment.” She detailed a number of mechanisms within exorcism rituals that havethe potential for therapeutic effectiveness, including the following:1. The sick role and therapeutic processes associated with the contextualizationof the experiences within a cultural system of healing beliefs that provide ameaningful representation of the condition2. The dynamics of therapist-client relationships in which the interpersonalbond and the charismatic, authoritarian, and omnipotent characteristics ofthe healer inspire the transformation of the patient’s own expectations,resulting in a cure3. Spontaneous remission or physiological adjustments based in the psychody-namics of placebo reactors, who have characteristics typical of those pos-sessed (e.g., free-floating anxiety, hypochondria, depression, neurosis)4. The cathartic discharges provided by abreactive techniques that permit areliving and release of intense emotional experiences that underlie theirpsychological problemsThese approaches to possession reflect conventional psychiatric perspectives thatare considerably expanded by anthropological points of view. Possession plays acentral role in psychodynamic transformation, providing models for the individ-ual to reconstruct self and social identity. Possession systems can play prominentroles in the integration of cultural change, through incorporating and managingoutside influences. Possession’s sociopolitical implications and psychosocialtherapeutic actions are exemplified in characterizations of possession phenomenaas a manifestation of cultural resistance. Possession beliefs can emphasize a stabi-lizing traditional cultural response in the face of cultural disintegration caused byexternally imposed social change. Possessing spirits and their behaviors can be adirect affront to the externally imposed value systems, expressing cultural prideand preservation of cultural identity in the face of powerful external forces thatattempt to change social mores.Kramer (1993) linked possession to experiences in which the self feels as if itwere being acted on and affected by “others’” ideas and behaviors. But for some itmay involve an experience of amnesia. The phenomena of possession illustratethe diversification of the self, incorporated as the other. There is also denial ofself-responsibility in attributing responsibility for a transgression to a spirit other.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES221"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Spirit possession beliefs can allow for expression of repressed aspects of thepersonality, enabling the sick person to behave in ways not normally permitted.Ward and Beaubrun (1980) suggested that the attribution of responsibility toothers, the spirits, allows possession to provide advantages for victims byallowing them to escape from conflict and guilt.Charismatic Catholic Healing and PossessionCsordas (1994, 100) characterizes Catholic charismatic healing as being aboutself-processes that are analogous in function to shamanic healing, most specifi-cally, shamanistic healing of possession. Among the prominent aspects of charis-matic healing are activities of “resting in the spirit” and “slaying in the spirit,” theexperience of being overpowered by a divine presence, a phenomenon in whichthe individual falls backward to the ground, often with a total lack of awarenesslasting several hours. This presence of divinepower reflects cultural concernswith the integrity of the person, as the Holy Spirit hovers near the person butdoes not enter the person as in demonic possession. By engaging a range ofaspects of the body-self, this experience of a relationship with the divine providesa companionship that surpasses the capacity of human relations. This divinepresence and its intimate relationship engage self-processes that produce nurtur-ing and healing.The predominant theme in this charismatic healing is related to intimacy,with imagery revealing the lack of intimacy or failure in intimacy, often stemmingfrom childhood or marital relations. The divine embrace with Jesus substitutesfor absent or lost parental or spousal intimacy, providing an enduring relationshipinvolving interpersonal intimacy. Divinities play a significant role as “internalizedothers” that facilitates the resolution of developmental blockages produced bytrauma. Csordas characterized the divine images, and Jesus in particular, as a“internal transitional object” that serves as a “developmental way station” thatleads to development of mature relationships (155–156). Csordas characterizedthe relationship with Jesus as a metaphor for selfhood, a coming to terms with thealterity of self that produces a new sense of self.Csordas also analyzed the charismatic concern with demonology in terms ofits implications for the nature of the self. These evil spirits are conceptualized as“persons” and “intelligent entities” whose essential qualities are represented intheir names, reflecting sins and negative emotions (e.g., greed, lust, anger, bitter-ness, and jealousy). Csordas called the demons “photographic negatives,” negativeattributes of the person. Demonic spirits attach to the individual, thereby bondinghim or her to these undesirable behaviors and emotions, which must be severed torelease the person. These negative aspects are viewed as not-self, dissociated fromthe self and attributed to the demonic entity. But their effects upon the personillustrate a crisis of control, a contested self.The effects of the demonic spirits provide insight into the cultural concernsabout afflictions to the self, manifested in the negative emotions and behavior. Theidentification of the molesting spirits serves to formulate the patient’s problems.The nature of one’s problem is manifested in the qualities of these demonic spirits,222SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"exhibited indirectly in mannerism and mood of the patient, including facial and eyeexpression and bodily posture. The deliverance of healing addresses these threats toself through ritual elicitation of emotional self-processes that engage the somaticmode of attention or awareness provided by the body. This is the existential groundof the self. Sacred healing addresses the physical body and its disabilities by changingthe habitual mode of engaging the world in an incremental fashion. “Healing allowsthis by challenging the sensory commitment to a habitual posture, by removinginhibitions on the motor tendency toward normal postural tone, and by modulatingthe somatic mode of attention” (Csordas, 71–72).COMMUNITY RITUALS: SOCIAL RELATIONSAND WELL-BEINGA core aspect of shamanism emphasized by Eliade was that ritual, which was onbehalf of the community and that the entire community was expected to attend.The effects of community rituals on social life and individual physiological andpsychological states are key aspects of shamanic healing. This healing dynamicreflects the primary social psychological functions of religion—meeting needs forbelonging and comfort and shaping individual psychodynamics and psychophysio-logical responses in bonding the individual with others in society. Shamanism is aprimordial form of group bonding, one with roots in the collective rituals of ourancient hominid ancestors (Winkelman 2009; Winkelman and Baker 2008; alsosee Chapter 6). Shamanic activities integrate and bond people in an intimate group,enhancing social cohesion and producing social support that results in opioidrelease (Frecska and Kulcsar 1989). Shamanistic healing practices evoke ancientmammalian bonding mechanisms involving neurobiologically mediated formsof attachment that release endogenous opiates and elicit endogenous healingprocesses.The Functional Efficacy of RitualRappaport (1999) emphasized that religion, ritual, and the sacred are adaptiveproperties of the human species, as well as adaptive social processes used by ourspecies to organize the social world. It is the ability of ritual to transmit informa-tion about the state of the sender, includingphysical, social, and psychologicalconditions that enable ritual to play a variety of adaptive roles (Rappaport 1979).In contrast, ritual has been traditionally conceptualized as repetitive behav-ior for which no evidence exists to substantiate the technical or physical effectsbelieved by the participants, imputing faulty causal reasoning to the participantsby the analyst who dismisses the effects participants presume their rituals toattain. Anthropological approaches have side-stepped this presumption ofincompetence by a distinction of the presumed manifest practical (technical)aspects of ritual versus the latent expressive and symbolic dimensions. Becauserituals generally assert means-ends relations not considered functionally possible,explanation has emphasized their latent effects on psychodynamics or socialSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES223"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"behavior. Rituals are then understood as acting and explaining at symbolic levelsrather than at technical or physical levels.These social symbolic effects are communicative aspects of ritual embodied invalues, cosmology, and social relations (e.g., see Skorupski [1976]). Rituals are seenas symbolic statements manifesting the culture’s basic values, especially humans’relationships to other humans, nature, and the cosmos. Ritual may state obligatoryconditions of social life and communicate that message to participants, bindingthem together in a group that feels a sense of commonality. Rituals express thestructure of society and the culturally ascribed meanings to the moral and naturalorder, providing an interpretive system that humans use to order experience andbehavior. Ritual activities communicate important meanings to participants,expressing traditional cultural knowledge and guidelines for social behavior.Ritual action at symbolic and social levels can affect all levels of humanfunctioning. Any ritual can have health implications, but those most central tohealing activities are critical rituals (crises responses such as healing ceremonies)and rituals for social transition (rites of passage). These assist the individual andthe social group with adjustments necessary to accommodate the individual’snew status and the status’s implications for behavior and social relations. Ritualsfor social transition affect health in many ways, including the integration of theindividual into new roles. Transition rituals are often directed toward the rela-tionships between social conditions and physiological conditions (e.g., puberty).This ritual relationship demarcates certain points of the life cycle as especially sig-nificant, with social meanings and biological processes integrated in social lifeand personal experience—rituals at birth, naming, puberty, marriage, pregnancy,death, and so on. The ritual association of symbols and biological drives is ameans of shaping and controlling human emotions and drives by providing themwith explanations within cosmological frameworks.But even these perspectives fail to fully appreciate the technical aspects ofritual. Ritual psychodrama can produce personal and social therapeutic effects asintended by the ritual processes. Such perspectives also fail to consider the technicaleffects of symbols, how ritual elicits associations and beliefs that transform experi-ence, as well as elicit physiological responses. Rituals may have direct physical effectsas well, exemplified in the physiological consequences and, hence, technical effects oftechniques for altering consciousness. Rituals can also alter physiological processesthrough a wide variety of mechanisms that induce retuning of the ANS balance. Thisretuning tends to block the dominant hemisphere’s functions and produces an inte-grative fusion with functions of thenondominant hemisphere; this structurallysynchronized condition tends to resolve internal conflicts and to produce euphoricstates (Laughlin et al. 1992). This synchronization depends on the elicitation of pro-cesses of lower brain structures that are associated with basic behavior, intentional-ity, and emotions.Ritual consequences for psychology, emotions, and physiological responsesconstitute basic technical effects of ritual. Shamanic rituals cause changes in thepatient, ranging from adjustments in social relations to the alteration in the bal-ance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which has direct implications forhealth. Although ritual healing is often characterized as symbolic, shamanic224SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"healing also involves a range of physical manipulations, including massage orrubbing of the body; application of the healer’s hands on or near the body ofthe client with the intent of transferring healing energies; blowing or fanning onthe body; sucking on the body; surgery and incisions into the body; washingand cleansing; and ingestion of a wide range of plant materials or other naturalsubstances (Winkelman and Winkelman 1990). The physiological implicationsof physical manipulations are numerous. Ample evidence exists that herbal rem-edies are likely efficacious in treatment of physical diseases, as would be simplesurgical interventions. Rubbing, massage, blowing, sucking, washing, and cleans-ing can be expected to induce a parasympathetic relaxation response.Ritual affects emotional, cognitive and interpersonal dynamics, producingphysiological changes that provide a range of mechanisms for transformation ofhealth. Ritual provides practitioners with a sense of conviction that they are pro-ceeding correctly and efficaciously, reinforcing charismatic effects and patients’expectations. Confidence in the healer provides emotional assurance, which elicitsthe patient’s own healing responses. The symbolic dimensions of shamanistic activ-ity and their relationship to psychosocial dynamics provide mechanisms throughwhich psychodramatic ritual enactments alter individual and collective psychody-namics. General characteristics of shamanistic healing rituals include elicitation ofplacebo responses through the use of trickery, sleight-of-hand, and expectancyeffects. Deception is deliberately perpetrated by the practitioner because it is knownto produce a successful outcome at another level (e.g., see Levi-Strauss [1963]).Trickery confirms belief and produces positive expectation, with direct implicationsmanifested in the “biology of hope” and in psychosomatic and placebo effects.Placebo effects constitutesymbolicmanipulations in that the treatment proceduredoes not have the biological mechanisms to produce the physiological effects thatare intended. But the presentation of a “mechanism” by which the desired physio-logical change could be effected (e.g., the placebo pill) elicits the desired conditionin the body. These classically recognized psychosocial processes of ritual transfor-mation are extended in the neurophenomenological perspectives of Laughlin,McManus, and d’Aquili (1992) presented above, which illustrate how the entrain-ment of symbols and physiological processes during socialization provides basesfor the effects of social processes and symbols on physiological processes.Physiology of Community Bonding: EndogenousOpioid ReleasersThe therapies of shamanistic healers are typically realized in collective ceremoniesinvolving the participation of the local residential group (e.g., the entire band inhunting-gathering societies). Collective social integration produced by shamanistichealing practices through the participation of the local community strengthensgroup identity, exerting an influence on well-being by enhancing community cohe-sion through reintegrating patients into the social group. The relationship of socialsupport to morbidity, mortality, and recovery indicates that social relations canhave prophylactic and therapeutic effects (see Winkelman [2008a] for review).Community participation and relationships have therapeutic effects derived fromSHAMANISTIC THERAPIES225"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"psychological and social influences (e.g., positive expectation, social support) andthe sociophysiological effects derived from the opioid-attachment mechanismsand the psychoneuroimmunological response.Kirkpatrick (2005) illustrated the role of attachment to the psychology ofreligion, reflecting a fundamental adaptive need of a biosocial behavioral systemthat evolved to maintain proximity between infants and caregivers. Attachmentsbased on affectional bonds and relationships provide a secure basis for the self,providing feelings of comfort, protection, and a secure basis from which toexplore the world. Attachment relationships are a fundamental dynamic underly-ing religions, providing the assurance that a powerful figure is available for pro-tection against danger and threats.Shamanic healing practices engage psychobiologically mediated attachmentprocesses that promote synchrony among individuals. Opioid release is implicatedin mother-infant attachment; social attachment; alleviating, mediating, and moder-ating separation distress; helping elaborate the positive affective states of socialcomfort; social play; and mediating the pleasurable qualities of social interaction(Frecska and Kulcsar 1989). The innate drive for affiliation and processes for evoca-tion of opioid mechanisms are integrated through shamanistic practices.A common aspect of shamanistic ritual is the enactment of an encounter withpowerful supernatural forces, symbolic “others” that produce emotional experien-ces considered to be the most profound known in these cultures (Eliade 1964).Opioids are specifically elicited by situations of helplessness (Maier 1986).Ritually induced release of opioids is likely triggered by the terrifying experiencesenacted by the shaman. Maier formulated a mock hyperstress theory for theelicitation of endorphins by severe psychological threats, where the ego’s involve-ment with highly personalized horror scenarios in alternate realities produceshormone release.A wide variety of shamanistic activities directly stimulate release of endog-enous opioids (see Chapter 4 here and Prince [1982]). Shamanistic healing activ-ities associated with elicitation of endogenous opioids include running andextensive dancing and other exhaustive rhythmic physical activities (e.g., clap-ping); temperature extremes (e.g., sweat lodges); stressors such as fasting, self-flagellation, and self-inflicted wounds; emotional manipulations, especially fear;and nighttime activities, when endogenous opioids are naturally highest.3A fun-damental mechanism of opioid elicitation found in shamanistic healing is theextensive dancing and clapping performed by healer and participants. The opioidmechanism triggered by the A-delta mechanosensitive afferent nerve fibers medi-ates the behavioral, analgesic, and cardiovascular effects of exercise (Thoren et al.1990), which has widely recognized therapeuticeffects. Thoren et al. indicatedthat disorders such as hypertension, anorexia nervosa, depression, and addictionsmay be therapeutically treated through exercise. Endogenous opioids have ananticonvulsant and inhibitory action with respect to interictal and ictal discharges(Molaie and Kadzielawa 1989). The opioid neuropeptides are recognized forreduction of pain, as well as for enhancing tolerance of stress, improving adapta-tion, and globally stimulating immune system functioning.226SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Neuroanatomical Bases of Ritual HealingThe basic processes of ritual are readily recognized across cultures in the similar-ity in “the forms of action and kinds of ideas that characterize rituals” (Dulaneyand Fiske 1994, 213). A biological basis for these cross-cultural similarities is fur-ther suggested by the common behavioral and ideational features that ritualsshare with a specific neuropsychiatric syndrome—obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD). These universal features of ritual and OCD are derived from neurognos-tic bases reflected in the brain systems and forms of mentation proposed byMacLean (1990).Dulaney and Fiske’s cross-cultural study assessing the incidence of OCDfeatures in ritual activities and work activitiesfound such features twice ascommon in ritual as in work. Although there are fundamental differences inmeaning, legitimacy, cultural values, and functions of OCDs and religious rituals,a number of the features found in individuals with OCD have strongly significantassociations with ritual: concern or disgust with bodily wastes or secretions; fearthat something terrible will happen; fear that they themselves may cause harm tothemselves or others; measures taken to prevent harm to self or others; repetitiveactions; special significance attributed to colors; and attention to thresholds orentrances. Such features, characterized by spatial arrays and symmetries, repetitiveand stereotyped actions and rules, and measures to protect against danger, typifyboth rituals and OCD (Dulaney and Fiske, paraphrase 245). In addition, theauthors suggested that rituals address relationships among habitualized patternsof behavior related to the integrity of self, to the relationships with significantothers, and to concerns with bodily processes, grooming, sexual impulses, andaggression. These regular features of ritual are also found in those with OCD, sug-gesting a common physiological basis in brain functioning.However, Dulaney andFiske suggested that a neurological basis for the structure of rituals is manifestedoveractively and dysfunctionally in individuals with OCD. In contrast to Freud’spathological attributions, Dulaney and Fiske emphasized that rituals are not col-lective disorders, nor are they compulsive, obsessive, or pathological, because theyconstitute intentionally adopted cultural means of achieving culturally definedgoals.The morphological and functional similarity of the actions and thoughts inOCD and rituals suggests that the human disposition to enact rituals is theconsequence of a specific human capacity or neurognostic structure. Similaritiesof the common OCD/ritual characteristics with specific forms of mentation asso-ciated with particular anatomical structures of the brain and their functions pro-vide a basis for substantiating the hypothesis of Dulaney and Fiske. I hypothesizethat the mentation processes of the R-complex and limbic system provide thecommon underlying features for both OCD and ritual behavior. The activationof the R-complex and limbic system is suggested by the serotonin abnormalities(excessive levels), because most serotonin in the brain is in the hypothalamus(MacLean 1990) and the hypothalamus serves as a central link between thesetwo brain systems.SHAMANISTIC THERAPIES227"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"MacLean (1990) suggested that there are forms of human behavior mediatedby the evolutionarily earlier centers of the brain. Bateson (1972) argued that thesekinesthetic and paralanguage systems have been elaborated along with the devel-opment of verbal language and have become even more complex, reflecting theircontinued importance in human socioemotional communication. Forms ofvocalization such as imitative song and chanting found in shamanic activitiesinvolve the tuning of this early communication system. MacLean suggested thatthese communication forms involveprotomentation, rudimentary forms ofcerebration responsible for regulating daily master routines and subroutines inthe expression of the major behavioraldisplays used in communication. Theseexpressive functions are primarily managed by what MacLean (1990, 1993)referred to as the R-complex, or reptilian brain. The R-complex is involved inthe integration of the various levels of reaction of the organism and regulate theanimals’ daily routines and displays of communicative social performances.The roles of the R-complex in ritual behavior and OCD are abundant, withexplicit similarities of routinization, isopraxic, repetitious, and reenactmentbehaviors in OCD and ritual.The common aspects of ritual behavior and OCDinvolving concerns with self, violence, and sexual impulses are based in processesof the paleomammalian brain. It manages neural information that subserves self-preservation, feeding, fighting/defense, procreation and sexual behavior, nursing/maternal care, and audiovocal communication (MacLean 1990). Ritual/OCD fea-tures specific to limbic system functions include sexual feelings, compulsions,automatisms, stereotypy, species-preservation behavior, and the emotionalbehaviors of anger, aggression, protection, caressing, and searching. Ritual indu-ces the paleopsychic communicative processes of the reptilian and paleomamma-lian brains. Rituals provide the basis for an expansion of consciousness byintegrating information from these lower systems into operational activities ofthe frontal brain and by establishing a synchrony with the frontal brain thatpermits symbolic reprogramming of the emotional dynamics and behavioral rep-ertoires of lower brain centers.CONCLUSIONSA neurophenomenological approach rescues shamanic ritual healing practices froma premature demise as delusional beliefs and establishes them as a set of sophisti-cated traditions for managing self, emotions, and consciousness. Shamanic prac-tices elicit neurognostic structures to facilitate symbolic action on self, psyche,and biology. Psychointegrators, music and dance activate emotional and personalprocesses of the paleomammalian brain and stimulate memories and feelingsunderlying personal identity, attachment, and emotional stability. Psychointegra-tors stimulate the integration of behavior, protomentation, and socioemotionaldynamics with language-based ratiomentation, egoic representations, and personalidentity.

The per-spectives of biogenetic structuralism identify the continuities in the rituals ofhumans and other animals as a basis for determining the origins of shamanicritual. The prehuman origins of shamanic ritual are revealed in its homologies(similar structures) with the common characteristics of rituals of the great apes.These commonalities in rituals imply their presence in hominids, the family thatincludes the ancestors and descendant species of great apes and humans. Simi-larly, the necessary ritual dynamics of humans’ unique ancestors, the hominins,can be inferred from these hominid commonalities and their homologies withshamanic ritual. The ritualized displays of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)andtheir associated individual and group functions are examined as exemplars ofgeneralized hominid ritual capacities. This baseline indicates the following ritualfeatures of our hominid ancestors which constitute pre-adaptations for homininritual: group reunificationdisplays; aggressive bipedaldisplays (“dancing”) bymales towards “others”; emotional group vocalizations (chorusing and singing);drumming; group protection; and individual and group integration. Their adap-tive foundations are illustrated by the many functions of these displays in chim-panzee society: greetings, hierarchy maintenance, group integration, intergroupboundary maintenance, and release oftension and frustration. The differencesbetween chimpanzee ritualizations and shamanic ritual provide a framework forcharacterizing the evolutionary developments of shamanism. These derived fromaltruism, which provided the basis for the coevolution of the religious and heal-ing capacities. Endogenous healing responses evolved from the potentials foundin hypnotic suggestibility and placebo effects. Healing capacities were also elicitedby a variety of factors that produced alterations of consciousness, specifically:enhanced opioid systems; exposure to the selective effects of psilocybin-containing mushrooms for their effects on serotonergic systems; the effects of231"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"long-distance running; and dietary and behavioral activities that enhanced dopa-mine and its functions.

Nonetheless, explaining the biological nature ofreligion in general, and shamanism in particular, requires understanding theirbehavioral origins in ritual. The behavioral focus of ritual illustrates the directconnections of the ritualized displays of animals with the sacred ritual behaviorsof humans. Theoretical frameworks for understanding adaptive aspects of ritualsare provided by the perspectives of biogenetic structuralism (e.g., seeThe Spectrumof Ritualby d’Aquili, Laughlin, and McManus [1979]; Laughlin and d’Aquili[1974]; also see Eibl-Eibesfeldt [1989]). Ritual is integral to vertebrate species,providing mechanisms for communication and social coordination. Displays andritualized behaviors provide a basis for mating, territorial defense, dominanceand subordination relations, hierarchy maintenance and group integration, andpsychological and social coordination of the members of a group.Ritual uses genetically based behaviors as exaptations, the use of prior adapta-tions for new adaptive functions. Animal displays (ritualizations) use innate behav-ior dispositions to provide signals to others that indicate readiness for behavior,sharing internal information and dispositions with other members of the group.Animal displays have communication and social signaling functions that derivefrom partial behavioral enactments of an animal’s intents (e.g., baring the teeth toindicate a threat of biting). Rituals provide information that facilitates intraspeciesinteractions, contributing to cooperative behaviors by making internal dispositionspublicly available. Animal rituals facilitate the flow of information, synchronizingindividual behaviors into socially coordinated patterns. Rituals constitute the mostcomplex behaviors of nonhuman species, a mechanism in which behavior has beenexapted as a sign to indicate a personal disposition towards a behavior that maybenefit self as well as other members of the group. For instance, raising the wingsinvolves a preparedness to fly and can communicate to other members of the flockthe possible need for them to also prepare to fly.Ritual is in essence a communication mechanism to enhance sociality of aspecies; this social focus to ritual has direct relationships to the well-recognizedsocial enhancement functions of religion. Laughlin, McManus, and d’Aquili(1979, 40–41) characterized ritual as “an evolutionary, ancient channel of com-munication that operates by virtue of homologous biological functions (i.e., syn-chronization, integration, tuning, etc.) in man and other vertebrates.” Thebiogenetic structuralist perspectives direct our attention to the ritual behaviorsof closely related species and their homologies with shamanic ritual behaviors;232SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"these homologies provide a basis for examining adaptive functions and biologicalfoundations of religion (see Winkelman and Baker 2008).Play and RitualThe enactive engagements of ritual found in mammals have necessary relations toplay, which has many of the expressive features that typify ritual. Social play is amammalian phenotype directly related to cognitive evolution (Bekoff 1998).The evolution of shamanism also exapts functions related to play, which MacLeannoted as one of the principal developments in mammalian evolution. Play conse-quently has special significance for identifying biological roots of shamanisms, animportance magnified by the role of play in mediating personal development,cooperative social engagements and advance cognitive skills. Play involves theuse of behaviors that are normally applied in aspecific context(i.e., hunting,aggression) but with signaling added to indicate that they have a different mean-ing involving play. Play involves the ability to attribute mental states, to make-believe (“play”), to ask permission and to negotiate social relationship; bows arekey features of the play signaling behaviors (Bekoff).There are many different functions of play, including learning skills, sociali-zation, physical and cognitive development, engaging in role reversals, and emo-tional release (Bekoff). Self-handicapping and role reversals are central parts ofthe negotiation of an agreement to play, where a dominant individual engagesin submissive behaviors inorder to engage an otherwise reserved subordinateanimal. This behavioral flexibility not only points to variant identities, but alsomanifests the cognitive flexibility and adjustments to changing environmentaland social situations. Play engages a future-oriented cognition, revealed in animalA’s signaling that solicits from animal B a certain behavior that is expected. Thatbehavior signals something contrary to the normal use of the behavior, anengagement with a make-believe imagined reality.Ritual Processes in the Great Apes: Baselinesfor Hominin RitualLawick-Goodall (1971, 52–54) used the term “rain dance” to characterize thebehavioral dynamics of wild chimpanzees in response to a thunderstorm. Followinga loud thunder burst, the alpha male began to stagger rhythmically, swaying fromfoot to foot and vocalizing (pant-hooting). He then ran up and down the hill,followed by other males, who flailed branches as the females and young watchedthe display. Such aggressive displays have the most complete manifestation inmaximal threat displays. Mild threats conveyed by raising the head or an armand gesturing as if throwing something may escalate to bipedal posture and run-ning towards an opponent on two legs (often while waving the arms). Extendedfeatures of the display include leaping, hurling rocks and branches, beating onthe ground, stamping the feet, and slapping hands against the ground and trees.The most dramatic is the charging display, during which a chimp (usually a male)EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL233"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"may flail branches and stomp on another animal. This display may be quadrapedal,but in its maximal form involves a bipedal charge that enables the animal to graspbranches and beat them on the ground.Chimpanzees incorporate a variety of acoustic signals into their aggressivecharging displays, including drumming, which is typically performed by males(Goodall 1986; Lawick-Goodall 1968). Drumming is a widespread mammalianadaptation with many features of conspicuous displays (see Randall 2001).Among chimpanzees, drumming is produced mostly by striking the hands andfeet against tree buttresses, although sticks are also used. This hand and footdrumming provides a system of long-distance communication audible at a dis-tance of up to one kilometer (Arcadi 1996). Drumming is usually accompaniedby choruses of pant-hoots, providing a variety of contextual information. Drum-ming activities provide communication between individuals outside of visualcontact, using an auditory signal that allows dispersed members of a group toremain in contact with one another as they forage separately. Individuals can beidentified by their own distinctive patterns of drumming (rate of drumming,length of episodes, the number of distinctive beats, and their volume), allowingfor identification of specific individuals (Arcadi 1996; Arcadi, Robert, and Boesch1998). These acoustic signals provide mechanisms to call on the support of othermembers of the group.Chimpanzee “Carnivals”These dynamics are not unusual behaviors, but features that are widely distrib-uted in chimpanzee behavioral routines. Reynolds and Reynolds (1965, 407 char-acterized as normal chimpanzee behaviors, these outbursts of calling anddrumming: “[O]ccasionally, about eight times during nine months’ observationsbut not at regular intervals, the chimpanzees in an area vocalized and drummedfor several hours continuously....Sometimes whole valleys along a stretch asmuch as a mile would resound and vibrate with the noise. These carnivals formpart of the ‘mythology’ of chimpanzees from the earliest reports.” The nine-teenth- and early-twentieth-century descriptions of these “carnivals” noted thatthey might last all night on moonlit nights, and with such a ferocity of drum-ming, vocalizations, and wild jumping that they produced wonderment andtrembling in human observers. Goodall (1986, 134, 491) similarly noted thatpant-hoot choruses may break out during the night, and that particularly spec-tacular displays might be made around waterfalls and in response to the presenceof other groups, who would elicit drumming, throwing, hooting, and vigorousdisplays. Reynolds and Reynolds (1965) noted that these collective behaviors,which they called “choruses” and “carnivals,” occurred under a variety of circum-stances, including nesting and awakening; meeting or splitting up of a group;before and during moving to new feeding areas; when on the move; in responsesto hearing other’s calls and drumming; when large numbers congregated in alimited area; when encountering humans; and commonly at night.These behaviors ofPan troglodytesare also seen inPan paniscus(bonobos),who also engage in vocalizations, drumming, and charging displays, especially234SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"when defending their territory against other groups (De Waal 1997). The compo-nents of these “rain dance” activities and “carnivals” are not unique to chimpan-zees and bonobos, but share commonalities with the displays of other great apes;this indicates the presence of similar behaviors in their common ancestors withthe humans, the hominids. Aggressive displays, such as bipedal charges and theshaking of branches are widespread primate behaviors, especially among the greatapes (Goodall 1968; Geissmann 2000), perhaps best known in the gorilla behav-iors that incorporate chest-beating. Commonalities among the great apes in loco-motor displays include kicking, stomping, and shaking branches; beating on thechest, ground, or vegetation; and jumping (Geissmann 2000).Great apes’ call episodes fulfill similar functions: interindividual and inter-group communication related to location, spacing, food sources, and danger,communicating emotional states that motivate other members of the group andenhance cohesion and unity (see Geissmann 2000; Hauser 2000; Marler 2000;Merker 2000). Their structural and behavioral similarities indicate that primatecalls are the communicative precursors of human singing and musical abilities(Molino 2000; Wallin, Merker, and Brown 2000). The primates have beenselected for the abilities to use verbal aggression, exemplified in screaming andshouting as part of intimidation displays used both within the group, and toother species, particularly predators. In these vocalizations we see the precursorto singing and other forms of musicality that eventually allowed for the morenuanced expression of human emotions.The variety of contexts of threat displays illustrate that they are generalbehaviors with multiple adaptive functions. These displays occur in greetings,when separated individuals fuse back together in the larger group; at copiousfood trees; at waterfalls; as “rain dances”; during all-night displays; in intergroupconfrontations; and for release of tension (Lawick-Goodall 1968; Reynolds 2005).The loud vocalizations and the dramaticcharging displays provide an auditorybeacon for those still distant from the gathering site. These dramatic ritualexpressions are an important tool for reintegrating the dispersed society into asingle group. The aggressive displays, which can continue as darkness settles, alsocan intimidate predators.The threat displays of chimpanzees provide a variety of functionaladaptations:•Establishing and maintaining hierarchical status;•Protecting the group and individual, including reduction of physical harm;•Establishing and maintaining boundaries between groups;•Producing emotional synchrony within the group;•Releasing frustration and tension;•Protecting the group members from predators, exemplified in drummingand striking with branches;•Expressing a group identity, exemplified in the shaping of vocalizations tomimic alpha males; and•Creating an auditory beacon, facilitating the individual reintegration withinthe protective community.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL235"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"But first and foremost, these rituals must be understood in terms of establish-ing an individual as a dominant member of the group. The power derived fromthese \"noisy displays\" and their social function is illustrated in the rapid rise to alphastatus of a chimpanzee, Mike. Mike was a low-ranking male when he began displaysusing empty kerosene cans, which he bounced and hit while making aggressivecharges. These displays were far noisier than normal displays, and quickly cata-pulted him to alpha male status, a bluff that he was able to maintain in the face of13 other adult males within the community (see Goodall 1986, 426–427).Religion and Ritual Capacities in ChimpanzeesThe calls, hoots, and aggressive bipedal displays with drumming that the greatapes use for a variety of social purposes were presumably universal to hominidsbecause they are shared by all of their living descendent species, the great apesand humans. This establishes that humans’ hominin ancestors also engaged ingroup rituals involving displays, singing, drumming, and dancing among mem-bers of the group. However, if we compare these chimpanzee ritual behaviorswith human religion, there appears little basis for commonality. Many centralaspects of human religion appear lacking in chimpanzee rituals, such as super-natural beings, mythical worldviews, and a sacred domain. Also, notably absentfrom chimpanzee rituals are the cognitive elements of shamanism—the altera-tions of consciousness and associated visionary experiences that produce spiritworld encounters. However, using Wallace’s (1966) model of the 13 fundamentalelements of human rituals, we see that most elements have counterparts in chim-panzee behaviors (adapted from Winkelman and Baker 2008):1. Specific body postures and gestures used to petition or thank supernaturalbeingsChimpanzees: Postures of submission to dominant animals or for makingrequests2. Activities such as music, singing, and dancingChimpanzees: Emotional vocalizations and bipedal displays3.

Exhortation, addressing supernatural entities for their intercessionChimpanzees: Vocal challenges to unseen others; begging for handholdingand reassurance5.

But we nonetheless find homologous behaviorsin chimpanzees and humans, particularly if we more broadly conceptualize super-natural relations as relating to “others” in general, rather than just a concept ofspirits as disembodied entities. The differences are important because they pro-vide a focus for understanding the evolution of shamanism in the differences orgap between maximal chimpanzee ritual and shamanic rituals. These differencesnotably involve the alterations of consciousness. Nonetheless, primatologist DeWaal referred to the extending bouts of pant-hooting as resulting in the chimpan-zee Luit being “nearly in a trance.” Although the behaviors that alter conscious-ness in humans—extensive vocalization, dancing, and drumming—are present,alterations of consciousness do not appear to be significant features of the ritualoutcomes for chimpanzees. So one of the most notable differences or gapsbetween maximal chimpanzee ritual and shamanic rituals involves the alteredstates of consciousness and the associated experiences of the soul and spirit worldat the focus of shamanism and its healing practices.Homologies of Chimpanzee Displaysand Shamanic RitualThe key features of shamanic ritual provide a paradigm for identifying the keysimilarities and differences with respect to chimpanzee rituals. Similarities showthe continuities with our hominid past, the preadaptations for shamanism, whiledifferences illustrate the key evolutionary developments in hominins leading toshamanism.The key shared features areMost dramatic community ritualAn inclusive community ritualNighttime activitiesEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL237"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Drumming, including use of hands and sticksEmotional vocalizationsAggressive alpha male displaysBipedal displays—“dancing”At the basis of shamanic ritual activities are a number of aspects of chimpan-zee rituals—such as charging displays, stomping, and drumming, which reflecthominid preadaptations, features already established at the beginning of thehuman line. Notably, chimpanzees often direct their maximal displays towardunseenothers (e.g., other distant chimpanzee groups). The aggressive displays,which can continue as darkness settles, also can intimidate predators. These dis-plays provide an emotional communication system that promotes social integra-tion, enhancing group cohesion and unity. The use of music and song inshamanic activities reflects an expansion of the preadaptations involved in primatecall and vocalization systems. These emotive vocalizations exhibited in loud callsand pant hoots have structural and behavioral similarities with human vocaliza-tions that indicate that they are the communicative precursors of human singingand musical abilities, vocalizations that provide information about internal emo-tional states and external referents (see Brown 2000; also see Oubre ́1997). Ritual-ized synchronous group vocalizations are at the core of shamanic rituals, and, asin nonhuman primates, provide an expressive system for communicating emo-tional states and enhancing group integration. The related display and vocalizationactivities that have been observed among the great apes, and the chimpanzees inparticular, imply that our hominin ancestors had social rituals involving emotionalvocalizations and, eventually, singing.Drumming and dancing, which are universally associated with shamanism,have deep evolutionary roots as mammalian signaling mechanisms. Such vigorousactivity that signals one’s location to others—both allies and potential enemies—is seen as an indicator of vigilance, excessive fitness, and a readiness to act. “Anamazing variety of mammals produce seismic vibrations by drumming a part oftheir body on a substrate. The drumming can communicate multiple messagesto conspecifics about territorial ownership, competitive superiority, submission,readiness to mate, or presence of predators. Drumming also functions in interspe-cies communication when prey animals drum to communicate to predators thatthey are too alert for a successful ambush” (Randall 2001, 1). Drumming is a wide-spread mammalian communication mechanism used to convey information,functioning as a “costly signaling mechanism” that deters predators with a displayof fitness, enhances survival opportunities for kin, and reduces the individual’sneed for more costly action.Theeffectsofcostlyritualsillustratebasicadaptivemechanismsofritual.These activities eventually united and integrated the group in the evenings, pro-viding protection by their intimidating sound. Displays are a form of intimida-tion of both the immediately present other and the unseen other that are usedto threaten and intimidate other members of their group, other groups, and evenpredators. This illustrates how these ritualized behaviors played adaptive rolesthat were expanded in hominin evolution.238SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"What were the factors that led to the evolution of these ancient hominincapacities into the rituals of shamanism? Shamanism’s ritual activities providedselective advantages for those capable of vigorous displays. The idea that ritualdisplays have functional effects has a long history in evolutionary studies, concep-tualized in terms of “costly displays” and proof of “excessive fitness” (Irons2001). These costly displays provide evidence of excessive fitness—“energy toburn”—that both alerts kin to a potential risk (i.e., predators) and deters preda-tors (who seek less vigilant prey). The costly display ritual is then a signal of theindividual performer’s commitment—demonstrated behaviorally—to help othermembers of the group.The energetic bipedal charges, brandishing branches that are at the core ofthe chimpanzee maximal display, were also hominids’ most important attackposture, intimidating other species (e.g., leopards) as well. The ability of extendeddisplays to provide all-night protection undoubtedly allowed ritual activities tocontribute to the survival of our ancient hominin ancestors on the savannas,where they lacked the safety of trees sought by chimpanzees in their nighttimedisplays.Shamanism expanded these ancient phylogenetic bases manifested in pri-mate and hominid ritual capacities, exapting them for much more prolonged dis-play activities involving extensive drumming, dancing, and music and extendingthem throughout the night. The nocturnal timing of the rituals provided a zonefor further development in integration of the cognitive processes involved indreaming. Dream experiences are stimulated by activity prior to sleep, and conse-quently drumming and singing episodes likely enhanced lucid dreaming andassociated alterations of consciousness. These experiences became central featuresof shamanism and its healing practices.The factors involved in enhancing shamanic alterations of consciousness areaddressed below in terms of a spiritual healing experience in the placebo capacity;the enhancement of social bonding in expansions of opioid bonding mecha-nisms; psychoactive plants that selected for enhanced use of exogenous neuro-transmitter sources; and long-distance running, which induced mysticalexperiences by unusual manipulations of the autonomic nervous system.THE COEVOLUTION OF HEALING AND RELIGIOSITYA central aspect of the evolution of human ritual and religious capacitiesincluded the emergence of spiritual healing. This development involves a varietyof capacities based in the effects of altruism. The evolution of this healing capac-ity also derived from hypnotic suggestibility and placebo effects, as well as theemergence of music and its healing effects discussed in Chapter 5 here (also seeCrowe 2004).There is an intimate relationship between the general capacities for religiosityand healing, reflecting interdependent co-evolutionary processes involvinghumans’ “sickness and healing” responses, an integrated social and biologicaladaptation involved in helping others (Fa ́brega 1997). Assistance to others elicitsEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL239"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"their innate, or endogenous, healing responses. This natural response to disrup-tions includes a psychosomatic mediation of physiological and hormonalchanges, where beliefs, hopes, and rituals induce positive changes in physiologicalresponses (such as a reduction of stress and increases in opioid levels).These opioid-related healing capacities are a reflection of bonding capacitieselicited in collective rituals that enhance emotional ties and commitment amongunrelated individuals. “Sickness and healing” adaptations also involve direct-careactivities (protecting injuries, maintaining temperature homeostasis throughcovering a sick person) and enhancing social support when sickness destabilizesrelations. The sickness and healing response requires an emotional awareness ofothers, a capacity that is manifested in the primate tendency to respond to theemotional displays of others with expressions of empathy and sympathy. Someof the emotions that naturally elicit healing responses are states of pain, suffering,and distress in others; these can evoke responsive capacities of empathy, compas-sion, and altruism. The sickness and healing response represents a type of emo-tional communication based in the ability to take another organism’s conditioninto consideration. This requires a theory of mind that can enable an individualto infer that another individual is suffering and needs assistance.Our awareness of the needs of others reflects the enhanced social awarenessthat underlies belief in the supernatural other. Fa ́brega proposed that what linkshealing with religious concerns is death. Since sickness can result in death, heal-ing is necessarily concerned with addressing one of the possible outcomes—death. Since failed efforts at healing lead to direct attention to death, healingbecomes linked to beliefs about afterlife and spirits. Healing rituals are conse-quently extended to care of the deceased and their intangible remains, and, inessence, ideas about spiritual domains and afterlife, leading to the developmentof religion.Fa ́brega proposed that the origins of the human “sickness and healing”responses involve an extension of ancient hominid biologically based tendenciesto sociality. This sociality is manifested in chimpanzee behavior typified in thecare of infants, and including caring, altruism, and compassion for offspringand relatives. These responses may be extended to the wounded members of theirgroup, for whom chimpanzees may provide protection, caressing, grooming,assistance, and food. The capacity to respond to disease and injury to other mem-bers of one’s group is an adaptation that was selected across hominin evolutionbecause it could provide advantages that did not require reciprocity. In assistingthe well-being of one’s own group members, such healing behaviors could beselected for because they helped maintain the overall numbers of the group andits optimal functioning. “Indirectly, by means of the process of psychosomaticmediation, the acts might induce hormonal and related general psychologicchanges that would improve function and sense of well-being in the sick person”(Fa ́brega 1997, 28). Healing efforts, whether or not successful, constitute a costlydisplay that can enhance the morale of the group by providing evidence of com-mitments to others.The significance of the healing capacity in hominin evolution is emphasizedby the fact that chimpanzees do not in general have behaviors that can be strictly240SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"characterized as involving healing. To the contrary, Goodall noted a lack of carefor others: “Care of the sick is not a helping behavior commonly found amongunrelatedchimpanzees at Gombe” (Goodall 1986, 385, emphasis added). The illand wounded may be shunned by the group, who often appear fearful of the sick,injured, and those with infections. Among captive chimpanzees, however, theremay be a cleansing of wounds and extraction of diseased teeth. These behaviorsreflect the chimpanzee’s capacity to empathize with others, understanding theirneeds (Goodall 1986, 385).The dramatically greater healing response in humans indicates it was part ofdivergent human evolution from our common hominid ancestors with chimpan-zees. Nonetheless, there are healing capacities present in chimpanzees’ ritualizeddisplays. “The minor attacks and the wild charging displays with all their ele-ments of aggression function to relieve social tensions and function to minimizethe physiologically undesirable components of stress” (Goodall 1986, 356). Thereis also an intrinsic healing capacity in the typical counter-response to aggression,the grooming rituals that calm aggression between animals. Grooming is a basicprimate social behavior, beginning with mother-infant bonding and continuingthrough life as a basic tool for building alliances. Attacks often result in a varietyof “reassurance behaviors,” which calm both the threatened individual and theaggressor. When subordinate animals seek reassurance from dominant animalstheir most frequent responses are to extend the hand to seek contact with theaggressor or to initiate grooming; the aggressor may respond to provide themwith reassurance through grooming, touching, patting, contact with the body,embraces, and kissing. Self-calming may also be achieved by hand holding,embracing, and grooming.Goodall concluded that chimpanzees learn that grooming has a calming effecton others and use it with the intent to manipulate others. The ability of groomingto reduce stress is generalized from mother-infant contact and the affiliativegrooming relationships that are generalized to relations with all of the community.Dunbar (2004) proposed that grooming has psychophysiological effects thatenhance commitment to others and increase cooperation. While groomingreleases endorphins, the administration of opiates reduces interest in grooming.With grooming we see a significant chimp-human “gap,” a loss of a functionalactivity in humans, who have the highest level of cooperation of any species, butwithout the extensive physical grooming characteristic of most primates. The tra-ditional explanation has been that language came to substitute for grooming, butthere is a big evolutionary chasm between grooming and language; furthermore,there is no evidence that language is a mechanism for releasing opiates! Dunbarproposes that music was an intermediate step, a bonding process with an abilityto elicit emotional responses, as was discussed with respect to the endogenousopioids in Chapter 5.Shamans’ healing practices maintain the aspects of grooming; these behav-iors are manifested in the shaman’s diagnostic phase where they may carefullyinspect all parts of the body, prodding lumps and abscess and cleansing themthrough a variety of procedures homologous with primate grooming activities.Shamanic treatments also involve physical manipulations of the body, includingEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL241"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"massage and manipulations with feathers. Laying-on-of-hands and similar prac-tices also are associated with enhanced functioning of the opioid system inhumans (Kunz and Krieger 2004). The endogenous opioids and hormones suchas oxytocin have powerful reinforcing effects on social bonding, enabling proce-dures that enhance release of these naturalsubstances to also enhance socialbonding.Hypnosis as a Foundation for Religious HealingMcClenon (2002, 2006) proposed that a common biological root of shamanism,healing, and religion involves a heritable quality underlying hypnotic susceptibilityand its associated effects (also see Chapter 1). I propose that we understand thisinterrationship in terms of a sociophysiological response, a social effect on psycho-logical states and physiological responses. Notably, highly susceptible hypnoticsubjects have experiences that are in contradiction with objective reality, but theynonetheless take precedence over objective reality. The alternative reality is one thatis demanded by a social relationship with the hypnotist and the expectations engen-dered by that relationship, particularly the mind-set conveyed by the hypnotist. Theconcept of rapport has been used to refer to the special social, cognitive, and affectiveinterplay that engages the subject with a sense of cooperation with the mental frame-work constructed by the hypnotist. Hypnotic susceptibility epitomizes the ability ofhumans to identify with the theory of mind manifested by others, in complying withthe requests of the hypnotist.Hypnosis is preeminently a phenomenon of social acquiescence to the demandsof another, in that “hypnotized subjects seem to be characterized by thelackof voli-tion and control over their own actions, with the latter being dictated by the sugges-tions of the hypnotist” (Egner and Raz 2007, 29). This control by an external socialforce is illustrated by highly hypnotic subjects’ great efficiency in implementing thestrategies suggested by another (the hypnotist), while having a general inability tovoluntarily alter their own strategic performance. Under hypnosis, the higher orderexecutive cognitive control systems that coordinate the interaction among a varietyof semi-autonomous systems is superseded by the subject’s accommodation to thedemands of a social other—the hypnotist—to accommodate to a view of realitydifferent from the objective physical reality.Hypnosis shifts the interaction between the frontal and limbic systems to thelatter’s evolved capacities for processing of survival-related information and feel-ings (Woody and Szechtman 2007). Hypnotic susceptibility engages the motiva-tional systems that manage social hierarchy, with the individual accepting asubordinate position and the imposition of the will of a dominant other, whoshapes the person’s experiences and behavior. This hypnotic response derivesfrom the survival value of the capacity to subordinate the individual’s personalperceptions and behaviors to the wishes of the leader. Highly susceptible hypnoticsubjects experience a dominance of the limbic structures in an enhanced orienta-tion to the emotional/motivation engagement with the hypnotist. This reflectsthe unconscious emotional control of volition that is characteristic of hypnosis,242SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"where the higher level ego structures do not identify with the volitional qualitiesof behavior generated unconsciously.Religious healing capacities were selected for through these adaptiveresponses involving acquiescence to a more powerful entity and the associatedhealing effects of the hypnotic capacity, dissociation and placebo responses. Hyp-notic tendencies are rooted in ancient primate capacities that reduce aggressionand stress and engage the relaxation response. These hypnotic tendencies aremanifested in stereotyped repetitive behaviors like “pacing” and repetitiveactions. For humans, the repetitive behaviors alter consciousness and produce asense of intragroup cohesion experienced as union or oneness, classical aspectsof religious and mystical experiences.Hypnotizability involves focused attention, reduced external awareness, anda reduction of critical thought processes that facilitates a focus on internal imagesand an enhancement of expectations. This ability for inner focus provides anengagement with symbols experienced as spiritual entities. Hypnotizability andincreased suggestibility also facilitate the placebo effect, providing a basis formiraculous cures that enhance faith and survival. Spiritual healing practices incultures around the world reflect the common origins of religiosity and shamanichealing in placebo responses. Phenomena associated with hypnotizability andplacebo effects include anomalous experiences such as ghosts, soul flight, posses-sion, mystical awareness, ESP, and similar phenomena generally given spiritualinterpretations. The beliefs in a spirit world may arise as a by-product of theseanomalous experiences, but the survival impact of these healing practices alsoexerts selective pressures for a disposition to hynotizability.The hypnotic capacity also enhances survival by providing enhanced accessto the unconscious mind and its psychological and emotional dynamics causingillness. Many psychological and emotional problems involve a repression of feel-ings and memories, as well as the conflicts that they produce. Hypnosis elevatesthese repressed issues into consciousness where they can be addressed andresolved. Suggestibility enhances symbolically induced psychophysiologicalresponses that facilitate healing. Elicitation of pain-reduction mechanisms is alsopart of the innate properties of hypnotic susceptibility. This makes hypnosisadaptive by enabling people to continue to pursue survival-related activities inthe face of significant pain. Hypnosis is also established as effective for the treat-ment of a variety of conditions, including somatization; mild psychiatric disor-ders; simple gynecological conditions; gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders;self-limiting diseases; chronic pain; neurotic and hysterical conditions; and inter-personal, psychosocial, and cultural problems (see McClenon for review).Dissociation as a Hypnotic AdaptationThe hypnotic capacity reflects a state of highly focused attention that creates adissociation of experience from the environment and body. Dissociative pro-cesses are key to hypnosis, possession, and shamanic healing (McClenon 2002).Dissociation permits an engagement with an alternative reality generally inter-preted in premodern cultures as a spirit world in which these powerful othersEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL243"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"can act upon our well-being. Perceptions, emotions, and behavior becomeengaged with an alternative reality in which experiences of supernatural othershave profound emotional impacts that can produce notable biological changesand significant long-term motivational and behavioral dispositions.McClenon (2002, 2006) proposed that dissociation facilitated hominins’ability to cope with stressful experiences. Their general benefits were derived fromthe ability to use dissociation to evoke placebo responses and healing; suchadvantages enhanced survival and reproduction, leading to selection for geno-types that could benefit from shamanic healing. A standard psychiatric interpre-tation of the adaptive advantages involves the ability of dissociation to reducestress. Dissociation provides adaptive benefits as a defense mechanism, allowinghumans who are traumatized, particularly abused children, to compartmentalize(repress) memories of these traumatic events; this allows them to experiencehigher levels of health by ignoring their unhealthy memories (McClenon 2006).Dissociation was also a necessary by-product of the modular evolution of thehuman brain, which allowed for unconscious processing of domain-specificinformation. This domain specificity of automatized modules meant that infor-mation may not be generally available to consciousness. Dissociation from theego is a process for achieving access to information in the unconscious. Lynn(2005) proposed that dissociation was adaptive because of its ability to by-passordinary self-related cognitive and self-operations and instead develop alternativeneural pathways that were not tied to awareness of others. By avoiding our ordi-nary ego states and their intimate linkages to the desires of others, we are betterpositioned to act in our own self-interest. Dissociation with possession providesa further distancing from apparent self-interest.Ritual activities can provoke this dissociation from ordinary reality and facili-tate engagement with the internal imaginal worlds. By using the ritual process toplace the person into an altered state connected with aspects of the emotionalunconscious (i.e., dreaming, paleomammalian and reptilian areas of the brain,visual imagestic presentations), shamans provided healing mechanisms in integrat-ing these processes with the social and symbolic self and eliciting placebo responses.Placebo Responses as Endogenous Healing MechanismsPlacebos are typically considered inert substances, “sugar pills” without biologicalmechanisms for evoking physiological responses. What is often misunderstood isthat placebos nonetheless produce measurable physiological and/or psychologicalchanges, the placeboeffect. Placebo effects include (Benedetti and Amanzio 1997)the release of endogenous opioids, thebody’s own natural opiate substances;reduction of pain and psychosomatic conditions (asthma, hay fever, coughing,ulcers); amelioration of mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and schizo-phrenia); and reduction of physical conditions such as cardiovascular problems(hypertension and angina pectoris), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, andrheumatoid and degenerative arthritis. Placebos are particularly effective for neu-rotic and hysterical conditions and other psychiatric disorders, gynecological244SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"conditions, gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders, chronic pain, and interper-sonal problems (see McClenon [2002] for review).Placebo effects derive from a broad group of circumstances that evoke pla-cebo responses. Placebo effects can be induced by set and setting factors such ascustomary settings of care, impressive buildings, special certificates and symbolicclothing (e.g., white lab coat). Placebo effects may also be derived from any inter-action with someone who induces expectations of alleviation of one’s problems.Moerman (2000, 52) defined placebo effects as “the desirable psychological andphysiological effects of meaning in the treatment of illness.” The placebo effect’sbasis in themeaning responsesuggests that it was an evolutionary adaptationderived from the ability of our symbolic capacity to elicit physiological responses.Humphrey (2002, 261) suggested that the placebo response is a Darwinianadaptation that evolved to address disease, injury, and other threats to health,an emergent property of other adaptive features that provided our “naturalhealth-care service.” These adaptive responses exapted other human emotions,particularly those related to hope, that have the capacity to elicit immune systemand healing responses. Humphrey noted that placebo responses are generated bythree general factors: past personal experiences; the power of respected externalauthorities; and rational and logical arguments. Our personal experiences of pre-vious positive treatment outcomes engender expectancy responses. The centralrole of meaning and expectancy in eliciting the placebo effect implicate theinter-pretationas key (Montgomery and Kirsch 1997; Moerman 2000, 55–56). Desireand expectation, like hope and faith, play roles in eliciting placebo responses thatreinforce response expectancy and its self-confirming nature. Emotions are key toplacebo effects and a key to the production of physiological consequences ofexpectation mediated through hormones and neurotransmitters.Perhaps the most effective of all placebo elicitation mechanisms is the powerof external authorities. Humphrey noted that placebo response cannot be self-administered, but rather reflects the outcomeof some outside permission. Theimportance of power in the placebo effect is illustrated in the specific characteris-tics of healers who enhance placebo effects—those with high status (age, prestige,and authority) that enhance confidence in the healing process. The power ofanother in eliciting placebo responses is reflected in characteristics of placeboresponders, who view their physician as competent and attractive and acceptthe physician’s decisions regarding treatments (Benedetti and Amanzio 1997).This acceptance of the power of the healer and general acquiescence to authorityreflect a submission dynamics that organizes hierarchy in society and which orig-inates in the mother-infant dyad in mammals.Having good reasons to believe in treatments also engenders positiveresponses; one generates placebo analgesia by doing something that one thinksis effective. This implies that expectation of improvement constitutes a form ofhuman medical treatment, eliciting the placebo response. Placebo effects are apart of all treatment encounters that elicit the capacity of the individual’s ownbody to respond positively to the hope of successful treatment.Bulbulia (2006, 91) supported McClenon’s hypotheses regarding the inter-connection between religion and healing practices in the capacities for placeboEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL245"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"healing, characterizing a human as a “faith-healing primate.” He proposes thathuman use of religious factors rather than secular ones to elicit placebo affectsreflects the advantages of self-deception, “how beliefs that may be wrong (i.e.,spirits) can, nonetheless, be able to heal.” Bulbulia noted that self-deception servesself-interest by making it easier for us to deceive others about our true intents.Self-deception also gives us the self-confidence that can be adaptive, has a “lowerror cost” in comparison to the benefits it offers in strengthening individualand group confidence and enhances health by mitigating the debilitating effectsof stress. Bulbulia proposed that these psychophysiological capacities are tied toa belief in a supernatural reality (rather than secular mechanisms) because of thewell-recognized ability of spirit beliefs to provide a sense of control over uncon-scious mental mechanisms and uncertainty, contributing to a sense of well-being.Since placebo responses are elicited by broader social expectations related toattachment responses—an ancient mammalian heritage—the placebo capacitymust have preceded shamanic healing practices. These preadaptations are mani-fested in chimpanzee submissive, reconciliation, and grooming behaviors thatevoke opioid responses. This capacity of expectations to evoke physiologicalresponses was a preadaptation that was exapted in shamanic practices, linkingthem to symbolic capabilities to produce new healing functions. The hypnoticcapacity for internal engagement with a visionary world also involves preadapta-tions tied to the dream capacity and the ability to represent in visually imaginedworlds of the spirit realms the representations of self and others. The hypnotictendency manifests the theta brain wave patterns (Crawford 1994) that typify theintegrative mode of consciousness (IMC), illustrating that the hypnotic tendencywas part of the selection for the capacity to adaptively experience alterations ofconsciousness.Shamanism’s central role in healing illustrates that it provided significantexpansions of other forms of altruism. Religious behaviors contributed to theevolution of the human propensity to help other humans, part of a broader setof altruistic behaviors that can benefit one’s self or one’s own offspring throughreciprocal altruism. The concept of spirit is an important mechanism for formingthese connections between individual and collective well-being. A common“significant other” provides a basis for expansive group identity, particularly,exceeding the innate capacities to prefer close kin alone in engaging in reciprocalaltruism. Kin recognition mechanisms involve both a disposition to identify kinand engage in favorable actions towards them. Shamanism was a central mecha-nism for expanding kin recognition mechanisms to others, using relations with“others” in the spiritual world as a basis for a common kinship that supersedesbiology.Attachment and Cooperation as Functions ofReligious IdeologyA variety of authors1examine the biological basis for religion in terms of reli-gion’s potential for enhancing cooperation within groups and encouraging other246SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"group beneficial behaviors. Shamanism is the primary biocultural institution thatexpanded the roles of attachment and cooperation from the mother-infant dyadto the broader group. Shamanic ritual practices and beliefs provide collectiveand individual adaptations in producing a community that is integrated througha psychosocial interdependence. This integration is based in eliciting a variety ofbiological mechanisms that enhance bonding and well-being.Belongingness and the Opioid SystemKing (2007) suggested that the evolutionary origins of religion are found in theprimate desire for “belongingness,” a craving and need for emotional connectionwith the other. This belongingness needs to be understood in relationship to ourenhanced endogenous opioid system. Since the divergence of hominins fromour hominid ancestors, there has been a positive selection for polypeptide precursorsand genes involved in opioid regulation (Rockman et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005).Studies comparing human and chimpanzee genome sequences found significantdifferences, which indicates that there was a rapid evolutionary divergence in thehuman line involving xenobiotic metabolizing genes that reflect adaptations to fre-quently encountered plant toxins (Sullivan, Hagen, and Hammerstein 2008). Wanget al. reported that the uniquely human pituitary cyclase-activating polypeptide pre-cursor (PACAP) emerged during human origins and that the precursor gene forPACAP underwent accelerated evolution in the human lineage since the time ofseparation from our common hominid ancestors with the great apes.The significance of the selection for PACAP involves its roles in the centralnervous system as both a neurohormone and a neurotransmitter. Rockman et al.(2005) noted that there have been waves of selective effects in the hominin linefor genes associated with opioid cis-regulation. Natural selection resulted in analteration of human prodynorphin, an opioid hormone that regulates geneexpression. It is a significant precursor molecule for a range of endogenousopioids and neuropeptides that are expressed to a far greater extent in humansthan in chimpanzees. These enhanced opioid systems must be seen as central tothe emergence of the human capacity for religiosity, since opiates produce expe-riences that have been considered homologous with and indistinguishable fromendogenously induced spiritual experiences (Smith 2000). This suggests thatsome aspects of religions experiences may have resulted as a by-product of theseadaptations and the experiences these chemical produce.Adaptive Advantages of Opioid SystemsWhy we have enhanced opioidreceptors must be contextualized in broad evolutionary terms of mammalianadaptations, as well as in terms of uniquely human characteristics. Oldham, Hor-vath, and Geschwind (2006) characterized chimp-human differences as involvingan increased connectivity in the gene co-expression networks in the frontal brainnetworks of humans. Humans have an intensification of expression of genes asso-ciated with the CNS and the frontal cortex innervations, particularly circuitryunderlying higher cognitive processes. Opioids undoubtedly played a role in thefactors that Hayden (2003) analyzed in relation to the evolution of shamanism.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL247"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Hayden suggested that linkages among resource stress, community relations, andintercommunity alliances enabled shamanism to contribute to human survival.Severe droughts several million years ago exerted important selective influenceson hominin populations that gave rise to modern humans’ shamanistic practices.Among the changes were abilities to forge close emotional bonds that helped sur-vival in inhospitable environments. Emotional bonds with other groups helpedassure access to resources for coping with crises through assistance with foodand physical protection. Hayden attributed this enhanced emotional bondingthat produced more secure alliances and helped ensure survival to the effects ofASC and their ability to create group bonding and identity. Hayden proposedthat shamanic rituals induced ASC that helped forge a sense of commonality.Our enhanced opioid capacity would have also contributed to the sense of con-nectedness and belongingness, as is widely manifested in the sense of unity andpanhuman identity associated with ASC experiences and opioids. These ASChelped to overcome the natural tendency to xenophobia and violence againstoutside groups, a tendency so well noted in the chimpanzees.The need for belongingness of the original attachment capacity is expandedin an exapted adaptation or coopted adaptation. This enables an expanded elici-tation of the attachment system and its rewarding effects on well-being. As thisinnate mammalian bonding capacity is deliberately extended to the processes ofhealing, it is being employed for new functions and constitutes a new evolution-ary adaptation based on exaptations.The enhanced survival success provided by these activities selected for thosewith enhanced opioid capacities. Deity representations of positive and protectiveentities allow for the same dynamics as secure attachment with a caregiver andelicit the benefits associated with secure attachments. The emotionally chargedrelationships with these dominant beings provide a mechanism for collectivestress-management procedures in healing practices and beliefs that instill positiveviews of self and optimism and confidence that enhance strategies for obtainingsupport from others (Chisholm 1999).Weingarten and Chisholm (2009) illustrated how religious concepts addressthe problem of the proximate psychological mechanisms that provide the basisfor ensuring persistent group cooperation. Emotional attachments and valua-tions derived from the infant-mother attachment relationship are exapted in thepositive emotional valuation of group leader to provide an affective mechanismfor group cooperation. This within-group cooperation reflects cultural selection,a transference of the attachment system dynamics to provide a basis for enhancedlevels of intragroup cooperation. By extension, attachment to a supernaturalentity is a mechanism for enhancing intragroup cooperation in meeting thedesires of a common entity. Mechanisms of the mammalian attachment systemare exapted to enhance levels of cooperation and integration in even largergroups through religion, superseding the capacity of a single “alpha male” to gar-ner group cooperation. The capacity to have an emotional attachment to leadersor a deity originally derives from infancy attachment to mother, making the reli-gious attachment to deity an exaptation of mother-infant bonding. But deity rela-tions involve more than originally found in the bonding of the mother-infant248SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"dyad as these basic mammalian processes are extended to bond larger socialgroups, exceeding the limits of kinship.Weingarten and Chisholm contended that multilevel and group-selectionprocesses expanded the capacities of the attachment system for enhanced co-operation within groups by using the supernatural agent premise as a mechanismfor intragroup cooperation. The capacity to conceptualize spirits is exapted fromthe dynamic of modeling the other’s mind, emotions, and intents. The ability ofspirit-other relations to expand the repertoire of possible others for self-processesconstitutes a significant expansion of religiosity beyond the original functions ofthe social other. Spirits give us social possibilities not found in the actual socialworld.These exaptations are used for a new function when supernatural agentbeliefs have effects on individual behavior towards others, for instance, encourag-ing adherence to social norms. Johnson and Bering linked supernatural punish-ment to group cooperation, reinforcing moral behaviors in ways that enhancehuman cooperation. One widely noted aspect of deity concepts is that they arenot limited by human constraints. Because human knowledge is limited, deityomniscience is a more effective deterrent against deceit, cheating, and free-loading, since there can be supernatural punishment for failure to conform tonorms, even if other humans don’t know about it. One of the mechanisms of reli-gion used for group enhancement involves the models of the spirits and theirdesires for our behavior. The personified representations of social norms in thedemands of deities to behave in specific ways help achieve implementation ofmoral systems that ensure fairness. Spirit qualities of omnipotence and omnis-cience are not exaptations of human’s own self qualities, but explicitly supersedehuman capacities. The omniscient deity concept provides something more thanthat provided by prior altruistic and cooperative capacities, a new means ofpromoting moral adaptations by extending the ordinary human capacity forcooperation.The adaptations provided by religion are illustrated in the way that spiritbeliefs provide adaptive functions at the group level (Alcorta 2006; Bering 2006;Bulbulia 2004; Sosis 2004, 2006; Wilson 2002). Wilson’s cross-cultural study ofreligion illustrated that spirit beliefs promote cooperation among members of agroup. Wilson also illustrated how supernatural assumptions constitute proxi-mate mechanisms that motivate prosocial behavior. Prosocial behaviors basedin the supernatural model of forgiveness and punishment allow deity relation-ships to function as a basis for the group adaptive effects of religion.Irons (2001) and Sosis (2006) illustrated how religion involves display ofcostly signals of commitment to the group. Shamanism, like other collectiveaspects of religion, provided a variety of mechanisms for enhancing intragroupcooperation through the same ancient biogenetic functions of costly signals anddisplays of excessive fitness as found in other animals. Shamans expanded thesein the costly signals of group commitment in the vigorous dancing and drum-ming that demand excessive fitness. The practices of shamanic drumming anddancing epitomize the costly displays that provide a variety of benefits. These dis-plays must be central to the physical defense of the group against predators, forEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL249"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"example, wielding branches as clubs against them. The drumming itself wouldhave warded off predators or produced a disturbing and disorienting effects asseen when used in the hunting of animals. These displays also manifest thedynamics of dominance that elicit placebo healing mechanisms.Bulbulia (2009) reviews a range of research that illustrates the adaptive rolesof ritual as forms of what he calls charismatic signaling. These public displays ofcharismatic signaling reduce perception of risks to collaboration by supportingpredictability in the social interaction patterns ofpartners in large-scale socialexchange. Ritual activities help to reduce uncertainty by aligning the prosocialinclinations of individuals into committed groups, based in the common emo-tional and behavioral manipulation of intentions and motivations. These ritualsignals have their effects unconsciously, operating outside of conscious awarenessby provoking intrinsic emotional responses to coordinate one’s behavior withothers. Consequently sacred rituals and the associated culture can help solve theproblems of group coordination and cooperation and produce reliable responses.Shamanism was the context in which the hominid charismatic signaling activitiestypified in chimpanzee maximal displays were shaped towards more dramaticsocial and emotional engagements with physical and non-physical others. Thislikely involved both physical evolution and cultural selection processes.Human evolution led to significant divergences from chimpanzees in theability to live in exceptionally large and internally complex groups that have inti-mate cooperation as a basis for success. In comparison with other species, we havea variety of ritual and other mechanisms permitting increased group size throughthe inclusion of outsiders within kinship ties, exemplified in religious commun-ities. Weingarten and Chisholm linked our cooperative abilities to the attachmentsystem on the basis of neurobiological evidence that there is an overlap of the neu-robiological systems subserving the mammalian attachment system and thoseneurobiological systems that mediate the processes permitting social cooperationin large complex groups. This evidence involves the neuropeptides oxytocin andvasopressin, which are foundational to the systems of attachment relationshipsand affiliation, and also implicated in enhanced social cooperation. These sub-stances also induce profound and significant alterations of consciousness.HUMAN EVOLUTION AND THE ALTERATIONOF CONSCIOUSNESSA variety of natural processes alter consciousness and induce shamanistic andmystical experiences, including drumming, singing and music, trauma, long-distance running, near starvation, sensory deprivation or overload, nutritionalimbalances, extreme fatigue, and plant substances. Consequently, these behav-ioral capacities of humans must be understood in relation to our biologicalcapacities, especially endogenous neurotransmitter substances, which also haveanalogues in the environment, such as the serotonin-like analogues found inpsilocybin- and psilocin-containing mushrooms.

These opioid related effectsare also seen in long-distance running and its capacity to produce mystical expe-riences, as well as in dancing, a ritual activity found worldwide.Human Evolution and Drug Use: Mismatch orAdaptation?The dominant evolutionary approaches to explaining the human propensity foraddiction characterize the desires for consciousness-altering substances and suc-cumbing to their addictive effects as the consequence of a mismatch or discordancebetween our acquired tendencies and the current environment (see Lende 2008 forreview). According to this view, drug-induced feelings, which are linked to adaptivebehaviors, are the result of our recent exposure to evolutionarily novel drug sub-stances. Harmful aspects of addiction result from a mismatch between our innatebiological tendencies and the options for meeting those needs provided by the envi-ronment. Drugs of abuse are thought to falsely trigger natural reward circuits andtheir sense of fitness benefits by blocking or short circuiting the painful feelings thatprovide the adaptive functions of stimulating avoidance behaviors.These perspectives have not considered the deeper evolutionary roots of therelationship between our nervous systems and these substances, which are bothendogenous to our nervous system and were also found in our ancient environ-ments. The evolutionary approaches to addiction address the effects that increasefitness (survival and reproduction). Since drugs have generally been conceptual-ized as causing problematic behaviors that reduce fitness, the idea that their usemay confer fitness is initially counterintuitive. But this is the result of a particularparadigmatic perspective.Sullivan, Hagen, and Hammerstein (2008) point to a variety of forms of evi-dence that the effects of these substances are not new, but were part of ancientenvironmental exposures that resulted in evolved countermeasures to these plantdefenses. There is a paradox in this concept of drugs that stimulate our rewardsystems because they have functions in ecological relations as toxins that inhibitconsumption by poisoning those who consume them. If the presence of thesetoxins in plants is an evolutionary adaptation to deterring consumption by ani-mals, why is it that these same substances are viewed as producing pleasurablerewards? Since animals do not evolve genetic capacities to reward nonadaptiveor fitness-reducing behaviors (rewarding the consumption of dangerous neuro-toxins), Sullivan, Hagen, and Hammerstein conclude that humans evolved thecapacity to make use of these exogenous substances.Several aspects of drug effects suggest an evolved capacity to benefit fromthese substances. In contrast to the debilitating effects generally attributed todrugs, Smith (1999) illustrates there are a variety of fitness enhancing consequen-ces associated with these substances. Fitness benefits may have accrued to ourancestors as a consequence of their ability to respond to these psychoactive sub-stances. Smith notes that across the diverse classes of plant drugs there are effectsEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL251"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"of enhanced vigilance, the ability to ignore pain in the interest of survival activ-ities, increased access to matingopportunities, reduction of apprehension andstress, feelings of detachment and euphoria, increased endurance and self-confidence, enhanced sensory and mental acuity, reduction of defensiveness,and reduction of depression and self-defeating activities. Clearly, many adaptivemechanisms could have been involved in human’s physiological and culturaladaptations to environmental sources of consciousness-altering chemicals.The effects of these toxins on the brain’s reward centers may be an accidentof plant-herbivore coevolution, but it also displays hallmark features of naturaladaptation (Smith and Tasnadi 2007). A reciprocal relationship between foodconsumption and taste is provoked by opioids—foods taste better when we areon opioids, and good tasting food—sugars—cause a release ofβ-endorphin.Mammals evolved to eat foods with nutritional value, and the rare presence ofsugar in the aboriginal environment led to the selection for use of endogenousopioid release to reinforce additionaleating behavior. Gestational nutritionalneeds may have selected for opioid systems that induce fruit cravings and themany associated nutritional advantages of their consumption.Defining characteristics of humans, such as abstract, generative, and context-independent cognition and other advanced mental skills require dopamine as aneurotransmitter (Previc 2009). The use of executive intelligence activates thedopamine system, and dopamine deficiencies are associated with a wide rangeof cognitive deficits. Previc shows that dopamine’s effects must be related tohumans’ evolved cognitive capacities because dopamine is central to advancedintelligence, not only in humans but other animals as well. All species withadvanced intelligence haveconcentrated dopamine, the only neurotransmitterthat expanded across the evolution of primates and hominids. Dopamine ishighly concentrated in the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial to human’s higherorder reasoning and planning (Previc2009, 15). The overall expansion of thedopaminergic system in primates and humans led to increased concentrationsin most cortical regions, with high concentrations in the prefrontal and frontalregions, especially in sensory processing areas where cross-modal integrationoccurs. Primates also evidence a greater density of dopamine receptors in Level1 of the cortex, the layer where coordination of activities underlying cognitiveprocesses takes place. Dopamine and acetylcholine predominate as neurotrans-mitters in the left hemisphere, the brain area managing these skills.Previc noted that in the overall human evolution of the dopaminergicsystems, there was a greater expansion of the prefrontal/striatal dopaminergicsystem relative to the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. He proposes thatthis allowed for the sublimation of impulsive mesolimbic drives and their controlby our rational intellect. Dopamine also plays a central role in goal-directedbehavior and has a role in dampening the physiological aspects of the stressresponse. This most important dopaminergic function reflects parasympatheticaction in the ANS, dampening physiological arousal and increasing peripheralvasodilation (which has roles in erectile function and male sexual behavior).Dopamine also mediates pleasant and euphoric states, but appears to have greaterimportance in inhibiting the negative emotional arousal of fear and anxiety,252SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"leading to a greater sense of control, an internal locus of control. This ability touse dopamine as a stress reducer enables highly dopaminergic individuals tofunction more effectively in extreme environments (Previc 2009, 36). Dopaminehelps in managing stress by assisting in active coping.The long-term evolutionary relationship between psychotropic plantsubstances and humans’ cognitive capacities indicates that there were selectivebenefits of substance use (Sullivan and Hagen 2002). Sullivan, Hagen, andHammerstein (2008) point to the benefits of the ability to use plant neurotrans-mitter analogues. These analogues are primarily in the monoamine neurotrans-mitter system, e.g., serotonin, as well as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, anddopamine. Human genetic adaptations to use these substances are illustrated inhuman-chimpanzee differences in neurotransmitter and neurohormone systemsand responses, particularly the opioids and serotonin.Human-Chimpanzee Differences in Drug Metabolismand Neurotransmitter SystemsThe conservation of aspects of the dopamine and serotonergic neurotransmittersystems across evolution is manifested in their basic similarities across mammalianspecies; there were also enhancements of these systems in human evolution. Genesthat control protein sequences in the brain have evolved much more quickly inhumans than chimpanzees (Shi, Bakewell, and Zhang 2006). Since the divergenceof hominins from our hominid ancestors, there has been an accelerated evolutionof and a positive selection for polypeptide precursors and genes involved in opioidregulation (Rockman et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005). The rapid evolution of PACAPprecursor genes was a consequence of positive selection, which occurred in thecentral regions of the gene, sites that have a critical role in enhancing the biologicalactivity of neuropeptides by protecting them from enzymatic degradation andincreasing their affinity for receptor binding (Wang et al.).The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium (2005) found signifi-cant human and chimpanzee differences which indicate that there was a rapidevolutionary divergence in the human line involving xenobiotic-metabolizinggenes that provide an ability to metabolize plant toxins. Some of the most signifi-cant differences are in segmental duplication of genes, their repetition in specificareas of the genome. These gene duplications produce changes in the onset andextent of gene expressions, as well as provide mechanisms for a diversificationof genes, which can occur during duplication, providing a basis for novelfunctions (Wooding and Jorde 2006). The human CYP2D6 gene illustrates theadaptive functions that can come from segmental duplication—its role in encod-ing an enzyme (cytochrome P450) involved in the metabolism of drugs. Sullivanet al. point out that the mammalian xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome P450provides evidence of a deep evolutionary history of adaptation to plant toxins.Our hominin ancestors underwent further positive selection for CYP2D6, anenzyme that enables the body to metabolize opiates, amphetamines, and otherdrugs, including plant toxins and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL253"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"There have been waves of selective effects in the hominid line for genesassociated with opioid cis-regulation (Rockman et al. 2005). The prodynorphingene is found in chimpanzees as well, but it is expressed to a far greater extentin humans. Natural selection processes have resulted in an alteration of humanprodynorphin, a significant precursor molecule for a range of endogenousopioids and neuropeptides. This selection for prodynorphin expression andendogenous opioid precursors contributed in significant ways to the evolutionof human perception, emotion, and learning.Oldham, Horvath, and Geschwind (2006) characterize the chimp-humandifferences as involving an increased connectivity in the gene coexpression net-works in frontal brain networks of humans. Humans have an intensification ofexpression of genes associated with the CNS and the frontal cortex innervations,particularly circuitry underlying higher cognitive processes. Highly dopaminergicminds are active, with above average intelligence, are achievement-oriented andgoal seeking, and are confident in their abilities (Previc 2009). This is the positiveside of the dopaminergic mind; there is also a dark side. This is illustrated in themany pathologies associated with deficiencies of dopamine. There are several dif-ferent dopamine-mediated personality disorders because there are several dopami-nergic systems (e.g., lateral and ventromedial). The ventromedial dopaminergicsystem provokes intense unconstrained aggressive drives to achieve distant goals,an unleashing of the motivation drives associated with wanting. It also stimulatesthe creative genius in a search for novel associations among stimuli. The stimula-tion of the lateral dopaminergic levels that enhances executive control and inter-nal locus of control can at excessive levels lead to the delusion of grandiosity andinvincibility, magical ideation about abilities to control distant events and to havecontrol over others.Evolution of Serotonergic SystemsThe dynamics of dopamine is balanced by the serotonin system, the primary systemthat is affected by psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin. Dopamine andserotonin are the two most important amines and play a complementary role inbalancing the functions of the brain and body. The right hemisphere and its sero-tonergic and noradrenergic systems inhibit the left hemisphere and dopamine.These serotonergic agents were also part of environmental sources, neurotrans-mitter analogues found in many genuses and species of mushrooms, particularlyin psilocybin-containing mushrooms found worldwide. These substances affectthe serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, producing profound alterations ofconsciousness that typify human concerns with the soul and supernatural. It isnotable that while humans and other animals tend to respond in similar ways tomost classes of drugs, there is a one class of drugs that other primates will notdeliberately self-administer—the psychedelics (McKim 1991). Although somehumans may respond the same way after initial doses of psychedelics, the typicalvariations between humans and other primates in response to psychedelics likelyreflects evolved differences in the serotonergic systems of our hominin ancestors.254SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Psilocybin-Containing Mushrooms as Sources of Spiritual ExperiencesFungal species containing psilocybin have been found around the world, providingan exposure to humans for millions of years. Guzman, Allen, and Gartz (1998) illus-trated the worldwide distribution of neurotropic fungi that are used as sacred plantsin cultures globally. The existence of such fungi deep in antiquity is illustrated byspecies unique to specific areas of the world. The premodern sacred use of these sub-stances is attested to in language, art, and physical residues of psychedelic substancesin cultures around the world (Dobkin de Rios 1984; Ratsch 2005; Schultes andHofmann 1979; Schultes and Winkelman 1996). These substances produce experi-ences that are directly related to shamanism, including (Winkelman 1996)•providing access to a spiritual world, the supernatural, bringing the mythicalworld to life;•producing an experience of the separation of one’s soul or spirit from thebody and its travel to the supernatural world;•producing a dramatic encounter with the personal unconscious, experiencedas the spirit world;•activating powers within and outside of the person, including the sense ofthe presence of spirits and their incorporation into one’s body;•establishing relationships with animals, particularly carnivores, and, per-haps, especially felines and serpents;•inducing an experience of transformation into an animal;•provoking death of the ego and its transformation or rebirth;•providing information through visions;•providing healing, especially through emotional experiences and release(catharsis); and•inducing integration of the group and enhancement of social cohesion.Since the features of psychedelic-induced experiences are also central to shamanism,exposure to these substances necessarily contributed to the development ofshamanism and the emergence of religiosity. This hypothesis is supported by theobjective ability of those substances to produce a variety of mystical experiences.Griffiths et al.’s (2006) carefully designed double-blind study showed thatpsilocybin has the ability to induce mystical experiences and that the effects onparticipants’ attitudes, moods, and their own experience of spirituality persistedfor months. The comparison with control periods showed that psilocybin pro-duced significantly higher ratings on the scales used to assess mysticism andaltered states of consciousness, including introvertive mysticism, extrovertivemysticism, internal and external unity, sacredness, intuitive knowledge, transcen-dence of time and space, ineffability, positive mood, and experiences of oceanicboundlessness. Psilocybin sessions had significantly higher levels of peace, har-mony, joy, and intense happiness. In addition, there were persisting effects notedfor the psilocybin sessions, including an enhanced positive attitude about life andthemselves, accompanied by positive mood changes and positive altruistic socialbehaviors noted by third-party community observers.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL255"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Human-Chimpanzee Divergences in Serotonergic BindingThese findings illustrate that something intrinsic to the biological properties ofpsilocybin and its effects on the human brain can induced mystical experiences.That hominins evolved to benefit from these kinds of exogenous substances isindicated by several lines of evidence. Raghanti et al. (2008) pointed to the widerange of evidence that indicates that the role of serotonin (5HT) in support ofhigher cognitive functions was modified in the course of human evolution andcontributed to our cognitive specializations. The central effects of LSD and hallu-cinogenic drugs on 5-HT receptors indicate that these should be prime candidatesfor evolution of our capacity for the spiritual experiences produced by these sub-stances. While humans do not have quantitative increases in serotonin innerva-tions in comparison to chimpanzees, there are species differences in innervationspatterns (Raghanti et al. 2008) and differences in the 5-HT1Dreceptor amino acidsequences. While chimpanzees and human serotonergic ligands (including severalindoles and ergots) have comparable, low nanomolar binding affinities and aremarkable degree of similarity in their binding profiles with other ligands (agentsthat will bind to receptor sites), there are differences that indicate molecular diver-gences of the 5-HT1Dreceptors of humans and chimpanzees (Pregenzer et al.1997). Pregenzer et al. found that while humans and chimpanzees do not signifi-cantly differ in serotonin dissociation, humans have significantly greater displace-ment (2.5 to 4 times greater) on the binding of LSD and other ergots (naturallyoccurring LSD-like substances metergoline and dihydroergotamine). This pro-vides direct evidence that human serotonin systems evolved the capacity to moreefficiently process this class of drugs (also see Sullivan and Hagan [2002]; Sullivan,Hagen, and Hammerstein [2008]). The importance of the psychedelics in humanevolution is underscored by their ability to have effects on the expression of genesin the frontal cortex of the brain (Nichols, Garcia, and Sanders-Bush 2003).The transcendent experiences produced by these substances suggest that theyled to the evolution of uniquely human aspects of consciousness. Shamanism hasbeen considered the first form of evolution of human consciousness to achieve thetranspersonal levels. The role of psychedelic plants in promoting this evolution ofconsciousness is reflected in their psychointegrative consequences and manifestedcross-culturally in shamanism and transcendent experiences. The ability of thesepsychointegrators to stimulate primary activities of the limbic system—emotionsand interpretations related to emotions, self-preservation, sense of self, and socialattachments—reflects their activation of these evolutionarily earlier levels ofcognition. Activation of these evolutionarily prior aspects of mentation nonethe-less represents evolutionary developments in human consciousness throughcognitive-emotional integration.Adaptive EffectsA significant aspect of these exogenous neurotransmitter sources, illustratedin the effects of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, is their ability to induce ananimistic worldview regarding consciousness, an intrinsic influence of these256SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"substances on consciousness. This biologically based “neurotheology” presents amystical view of the world that has been fundamental to the understandings ofconsciousness for many cultures and reflecting an adaptive feature of the abilityto use plant-derived exogenous sources of neurotransmitters. Their effects onthe serotonergic nervous system and macro-level processing in the brain producealterations of consciousness that have been core to consciousness traditions.These traditions have models of consciousness as spiritual, multileveled, andtranscendent, with the manifestations of altered consciousness considered torepresent the most significant levels of consciousness.This coevolution of our capacities for using exogenous neurotransmittersubstances and experiencing unusual forms of consciousness involved a varietyof adaptive effects. As Sullivan et al. note, these are rare neurotransmitter sub-stances, most require dietary precursors, so the capacity to metabolize and useexogenous sources of these substances provided intrinsic benefits. These psycho-tropic plants are capable of producing a variety of other adaptive effects as well.The toxic effects of their alkaloids on a wide range of intestinal worms wouldhave contributed to human health, likely contributing to the ubiquitous sensethat these plants are in some way “cleansing.” There is a range of physiologicaleffects as a function of dose and contextual factors, including increased awarenessand attention, enhanced visual acuity, and excitement, including erection andsexual arousal (see Winkelman and Schultes 1996 for review). Psychotropicplants also provided adaptive advantages in their integrative and informationalproperties associated with the alteration of consciousness (Winkelman 2007a).Mandell (1980) suggests that the common biological basis of diverse proce-dures, agents, and conditions involves disinhibiting the temporal lobe structures,which results in the emotional flooding experienced as ecstasy and visions fromthe “inner world.” The activation of the hippocampal-septal system underlyingthese effects has terminal projections from the somatic and autonomic nervoussystems, forming part of an extensivesystem of innervations connecting areasof the brain, in particular, linking the frontal cortex with the limbic system. Thelimbic system (the paleomammalian brain) is that part of the brain where emo-tions are integrated with memories. Enhancement of these processes with exog-enous neurotransmitter analogues such as the DMT in psilocybin mushroomsillustrates their adaptive advantages.The effects of these substances on neural, sensory, emotional, and cognitiveprocesses illustrate their adaptive advantages produced by the inhibition of theserotonergic systems. This involves an enhancement of consciousness provokedby increasing integrative information processing, achieved by inhibiting the sero-tonergic circuitry controlling dopamine systems and repressing the lower struc-tures of the brain (paleomammalian and reptilian). Psychointegrative effectsderive from the disinhibition of these emotional and social processes, resultingin integrative brain functions as a result of the integration of limbic system emo-tional processes into the neocortex. This results from the loss of the inhibitoryeffect of serotonin on the mesolimbic temporal lobe structures, leading tosynchronous discharges in the temporal lobe limbic structures, and resulting ina functional integration of the different systems of the brain.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL257"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"There are a variety of adaptive aspects of altered consciousness in general.One feature involves their ability to enhance access to normally unconsciousinformation and to integrate thought processes. These innate propensities pro-duce an integration of different brain systems, enhance learning of informationand promote behavioral, emotional, andcognitive integration. Religious ASCreflect an adaptive response involving enhanced integration of information fromunconscious processes of the mind, integrating the body-level awareness of theprelinguistic mind into consciousness. Religious experiences are encounters withour own unconscious potentials in ways that are directly accessible to personalconsciousness, enabling normally unconscious information to be used indirecting our adaptations to the environment. The functional roles provided bythe dream capacity are elicited both by shamanic ritual and the exogenous opioidand serotonergic analogues.ASC and UnlearningWhile cumulative learning is the normal for cultural beings, these adaptationseventually reach their limitations or even fail under catastrophic change ormajor life cycle changes such as adult transition, which require “a large scaleconversion of the intentional structures of meaning (Freeman 2000b, 149).The need for radically new structures of meaning cannot be met by cumulativelearning, but requires unique processes that can dissolve existing meaning struc-tures and replace them with new ones. “The process of unlearning is a remark-able achievement of biological and cultural evolution of mammals” (Freeman1995, 152). This unlearning involves a process which Pavlov discovered andlabeled “transmarginal inhibition,” in which collapse due to extreme stressorsresults in a complete loss of prior learned associations. Thisprocess of stressleading collapse results in the loss of former behavioral patterns, allowing fornew learning without interference from the previous patterns. The dynamicsof these processes in humans have been characterized as “brain washing,” a“cleansing of the slate” that allows for learning of new bonds of social cohesion.Freeman notes that the breakdown allows for the persistence of general knowl-edge, motor skills, language abilities and personal memories, while dissolvingsocial attitudes and values. The social support provided by ritual then allowsfor social guidance to reshape the person to new attitudes and expectations.Traditionally these activities have been key parts of the adolescent-to-adult tran-sition found in many cultures, where rites of passage involving music, dance,and collective ceremonies are used to both provoke the transmarginal inhibitionand to guide the restructuring that occurs when the person returns to con-sciousness. Socialization requires repeated unlearning, which is mediated byoxytocin and endorphins (paraphrase Freeman 2000b,134). The processes ofunlearning require that one “loosen the self-conscious control of individualsand dissolve their cognitive and emotional structures....Unlearning is medi-ated by the neuromodulators in the brainstem, particularly oxytocin andvasopressin” (Freeman 1995, 11).258SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Ecological ConsciousnessBrown (2009) noted the pervasive effects of the psychedelics on ecological con-sciousness, including the foundation of the deep ecology movement by ArneNaess, whose ecological awareness was profoundly influenced by LSD. Similarly,the organizer of Biosphere 2, John Allen, was inspired by peyote experiences.The enhanced awareness of the ecological system widely reported by those usingpsychedelics may reflect some of the more generic aspects of the effects of thesesubstances: a reduction of ego boundaries; an enhanced sense of connectedness;a sense of the intimate relations to nature and one’s own body; a sense of sentienceto everything. There is a widely expressed tendency for psychedelics to enhancecommunication with nature, reflecting a long-denigrated “nature mysticism.”These experiences enhance a sense of personal connectedness with nature and anenhanced valuation of nature that encourages care of the planet. A focus on naturemay be a side-effect of our reduction of ego-centeredness, an enhanced conscious-ness of the presence of nature that comes from a diminution of self-importance.This relationship is often expressed as biophilia, a love of nature that is alsodiscovered in another unique human capacity—long-distance running.Bipedalism and Mystical Experience: The Runner’s HighAnother influence contributing to the human capacity for spirituality emerged as aby-product of one of the human line’sunique features,long-distance running.Although humans are not considered as effective runners as many other mammals,“No primates other than humans are capable of ER [endurance running]” (Brambleand Lieberman 2004, 345). InHomo erectus, this capacity led to the emergence ofspiritual experiences. A natural basis for inducing ASC and mystical experiencesderives from endurance running, long-distance running, and ultraruning (Brambleand Lieberman 2004; also see Jones [2005]; Noakes [1991]). Commonly known asthe “runner’s high,” it is also associated with features typical of mystical experiencessuch as positive emotions such as happiness, joy and elation; a sense of inner peace-fulness and harmony; a sense of timelessness and cosmic unity; and a connection ofoneself with nature and the Universe (Dietrich 2003).The processes by which mystical experiences are induced by running beginwith the saturation of the sympathetic-ergotropic system. In addition to the acti-vation produced in many body systems by the running, the prolonged activityforces a kind of meditative breathing in the regular methodic inhalation andexhalation. Physical stress activated by long-distance running provokes therelease of the opioid, adrenaline, and noradrenaline neurotransmitters, andelevated body temperatures, oxygen depletion, and chemical and neuronal imbal-ances that can create unusual state of awareness. Jones placed ultrarunning highin the context of the extreme activation of the ANS. Extensive running leads toa saturation of the SNS and associated structures of the hypothalamus and amyg-dala (particularly the left hemispheric), a “spillover” effect that leads to the simul-taneous activation of the PNS and the amygdala and hippocampus areas of theEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL259"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"right hemisphere. This simultaneous activation of what are usually separate func-tions and areas of the brain results in a saturation of brain areas responsible forgeneral orientation and attention, visual integration, emotional processing, andexpression of verbal-conceptual phenomena (Jones, 44). This results from a gen-eral overload of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems andassociated structures (hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus) and leads toa cessation of normal attention, emotional processing, and comprehension. Thiscessation of normal processes produces a sense of ineffability and a disintegrationof the self, which is generally experienced as a condition of profound peacefulness(Jones, 44). It is the shutdown of the normal processes of the mind that lead tothese special experiences.Sands and Sands (2009) proposed that the selection for long-distancerunning inHomosubsequently selected for a form of spirituality, a “horizontalawareness,” orbiophilia, that operated through existing neurobiological rewardsystems. The “high” associated with long-distance running situated our ancestorsin a dynamic environment within which they felt an intimate connection withnature. They reviewed evidence showing that the neurochemicals released duringendurance running are tied into a variety of preexisting reward pathways, includ-ing monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), endorphins, andendocannabinoids.The primary mechanisms postulated for the runner’s high were endogenousopioids released in response to exercise, stress, and pain, with both serotonin andthe endogenous opioids involved in regulating dopamine release. There is evidencethat running also releases serotonin and dopamine, both of which have positiveeffects on mood, enhance performance, and elicit our basic reward systems.Dietrich and McDaniel (2004) found that endurance runners have increases in anendocannabinoid, anandamide,a substance that produces psychoactive effectssimilar to the THC of marijuana, including euphoria, a sense of transcendence,and a sense of contact with the divine. Thus a side effect of the acquisition ofthe capacity for long-distance running was a variety of mystical experiences andassociated pleasurable sensations. This running capacity also provided a physicalbasis for the ritual capabilities of dance, as well as the expressive capacities ofmimesis discussed earlier.Bipedalism and DanceBipedalism also provided the capacity for another uniquely human capability—dance—which is associated with spiritual practices in cultures around the world.The dramatic chimpanzee charging displays are a limited capacity compared tothe capabilities for running and dance that evolved in humans. Bachner-Melman et al. (2005) found specific gene polymorphisms associated with peoplewho are engaged intensively with creative dance performance. While there arecommon genetic features of humans that give us all a uniquely human capacityfor mimesis and dance, there are also variable gene expressions and interactionsthat are significantly associated with the engagement with professional dance.260SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Bachner-Melman et al.’s study identified a genotype associated with sero-tonin transporters (SLC6A4) and an arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR1a),an opioid receptor. In comparison with normal controls and professional ath-letes, dancers had higher levels of both of these gene frequencies, which weresignificantly associated with a measure of spirituality and altered states of con-sciousness (the Tellegren Absorption Scale). “We therefore hypothesize that theassociation between AVPR1a and SLC6A4 reflects the social communication,courtship, and spiritual facets of the dancing phenotype rather than other aspectsof this complex phenotype, such as sensorimotor integration” (Bachner-Melmanet al., 3 of 33).The SLC6A4 allele is a more efficient serotonin transporter and is consideredto be more effective in the removal of serotonin from the synapses. The AVPR1agene is widely associated with social communication and affiliative behavior inprimates. They propose that the association between dance and the AVPR1a genereflects the central role of communication and social relations in the functions ofdance. An evolutionary basis for the linkages of the AVPR1a gene and dancereflect the role of vasopressin in vertebrates’ courtship behavior. Vasopressin iswell-recognized for its role in human bonding, both maternal behavior andromantic attachment. Thus, they propose that the interaction of these genesand human dance involves an engagement with the emotionality of dance experi-ences. Human dancing is an aspect of courtship and social communication thathas neurochemical and genetic mechanisms that indicate a conservative evolu-tionary history, with the foundations of mating displays and affiliative behaviorsfound across vertebrates species (Bachner-Melman et al.).There is an interaction between vasopressin and serotonin in the hypothala-mus, playing a key role in control of communicative behavior. The association ofserotonin and the opioid system (vasopressin) with ASC and mystical experien-ces, as well as enhanced dance propensities, suggest that these capacities of danceand ASC coevolved. The self-regulatory processes of the limbic system are medi-ated by neuromodulators, especially dopamine, endorphins, oxytocin, and sero-tonin, as well as melatonin and histamine, with vasopressin central to theneuromodulatory mechanisms by which basic mammalian bonding processeswere extended to larger groups (Freeman 1995). Chapter 4 described the manyways in which shamanic practices alter these neuromodulatory systems. The asso-ciation of serotonin and the opioid system (vasopressin) with alterations of con-sciousness and mystical experiences, as well as enhanced dance propensities,indicates a coevolution of the capacities of dance and the capacities for alteringconsciousness. Clearly, dance has that capacity to induce alterations of conscious-ness through a variety of mechanisms (such as stimulating the release of opioids,producing rhythmic stimulation of the brain, as well as inducing exhaustion andcollapse; see Chapter 4). Further genetic adaptations involving the serotonergicand opioid systems in dance are linked to the evolution of a set of uniquelyhuman capacities involving theexpressive capacity of mimesis, the ability tointentionally represent through imitation. This body-based imagestic system ofexpression reflects a level of consciousness communicated through a varietyEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL261"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"of expressive forms—such as play, drama, ritual, music, emotions, shamanicritual, and ultimately human spirituality and religion.Freeman (1995) characterizes the last half-million years of human evolutionas based in the adaptations made for enhanced social communication. Given thatour knowledge of the external world is limited to the representations producedwithin our brains, this solipsism can only be moderated by information signalsfrom other brains. Freeman (1995, 2000b) characterizes music and dancing asthe quintessential technology that humans developed to bridge the solipsisticgulf. Freeman characterizes dance as “the biotechnology of group formation”(2000b, 129), with rhythmic dancing, marching, clapping, and chanting consti-tuting a central part of ancient socialization processes, engaging our entire bodiesand the motor and somatosensory systems in a way that links the group into acooperative community. The rhythmically repeated motions constitute a basisfor cooperation by making the intentions and behaviors of others predictable,using movement and music as the system of coordination. The expression ofintentions in commonly observable body actions of dance provides a basis fornonverbal communication and a basic mechanism for coordination and bondingof groups beyond the family. The capacities of “musical skills played a major rolein the evolution of the human intellect” (Freeman 2000b, 134). Freeman notesthat the development of ritual group identity in humans is mediated by musicand dance, as well as other expressive activities such as sports.A Hierarchy of Exapted Functions: Display, Mimesis,Dance, and RitualAn ancient capacity of our hominid ancestors—exemplified in the aggressivebipedaldisplays of branch wielding chimpanzees—was a platform from which a variety ofhominin adaptations occurred. This was a basis from which physical attack anddefense capabilities led to the selection for characteristics that eventually establishedthe uniquely human abilities of bipedalism, running, dance, and mimetic expres-sion. These capacities together created a new level of ritual functioning when theycombined with the emergence of the also uniquely human capacities of song andmusic. But while mimesis provided a new level of abstract representation, it toowas an exaptation of more ancient functions. This expressive basis undoubtedlyhas deeper roots than our hominid ancestors, which is reflected in the way mirrorneurons function. Mirror neurons fire not only during the carrying out of tasksbut also when an animal observes another doing that task. Our ancient capacitiesfor mimesis must have exapted those functions of identification with the mentaland behavioral states of others and then extended them. Our capacities for socialunderstanding of others must have their more ancient roots in these capacities andtheir ability to be used to deliberately express our behavioral intentions.Music and the Origins of Shamanic RitualThe evolution of our uniquely human capacities for music and dance provided abasis for a human ritual dynamic that sharply distinguish us from our ape cousins262SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"(Malloch and Trevarthen 2009). Human ritual dynamics expanded the samecapacities of ritual found in the animal kingdom—reduction of in-group conflictand enhancement of social cohesion. These capacities for displays and perfor-mance with music and dance provided an enhanced capacity to expand the func-tions of ritual of binding groups together into a common consciousness. Thisritual social dynamic is a medium for expression of shared meaning, a system thatprovided a necessary substrate for language. This dynamic of rhythmic expres-sion, exemplified in dance and music, illustrates one of the most fundamentalof all human forms of communication—behavior and mimesis as discussed inChapters 3 and 4.The possible adaptive roles of music generally have been discounted or givenscant attention. Yet there are several mechanisms through which music canenhance adaptation at individual and group level. The physical beat of music pro-duces a synchronization that coordinates and organizes the group. Music hasbeen considered one of the most effective devices for group coordination,whether it involves coordination of movement, interpersonal entrainment, orthe creation of a spirit of teamwork (Brown 2000). Musical experiences contrib-ute to formation of stronger emotional bonds among the members of a group,extending a sense of unity and connectedness. Group experience of music hasthe potential of a unifying the group’s experiences, inducing common emotionsand producing a synchronized response to the environment.These musical capacities have many evolutionary foundations; Dissanayake(2009) sees the most important contributions as involving adaptations for interac-tions between mother and infant. The communicative rhythmic dynamic betweenmother and infant begins in the first weeks of life with musical and dance-like com-ponents that coordinate their communicative turn-taking. Dissanayake proposedthat the origins of our musicality derived from the expressive emotional modula-tion of the love bond between mother and infant, a mutuality based in a dynamicof emotional cooperation. This expressive emotional modulation is a basis of allcommunication, including language. This fundamental role of rhythmic interac-tions in providing the basis for sociality and communication is one of the formsof evidence pointing to the biological and adaptive bases of music.Dissanayake rejects theories postulating the adaptive origins of musicality inmate attraction and sexual selection, noting that the competition aspect of sexualselection contradicts the cooperative aspects of musicality. Competition cannothave been the selective force for the evolution of the musical capacity because someof the most salient aspects of music—pitch blending and synchronization—depends on cooperation and coordination, not competition. An evolutionaryaccount of music based on concordance and bonding better explains why musicis found at the core of communal ritual in small-scale societies. Music is intrinsicto a broader range of expressive activities such as clapping, playing instruments,expressive gestures, and dancing that are central aspects of human group ritualbehavior because they express and facilitate affiliative intentions.Dissanayake proposes that the evolution of musicality must be seen as a conse-quence of adaptations forced by bipedalism, which resulted in selection for moreimmature offspring because of the consequential narrowing of the pelvis and birthEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL263"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"canal. Musicality was a way for mothers to maintain a higher level of interactionwith their more dependent offspring, using the vocal modality and its emotionalmodulation capacities for enhancing communication and connection. This hasresulted in a species-specific human pattern of “motherese” that emerges inmother-infant interaction within weeks of birth. This dynamics of exchange—involving body movements, facial dynamics and emotional expressions—involvesthe same behaviors found in affiliative and submissive ritualizations of otherprimates. Dissanayake demonstrates how these mother-infant dynamics are thefoundations of what evolved into uniquely human musicality. The same interactiveand communicative dynamics that bond mother and infant are later extended toenhance other forms of bonding of larger social groups. Music evolves fromcapacities related to a dynamic of love that enhanced human survival throughincreasing bonding.The evolution of these expressive capacities likely involved “an evolutionaryexaptation of social-emotional systems that became the medium by which ourancestors harmoniously coordinated not only intimate engagements, but alsoambitious group activities” (Panksepp and Trevarthen 2009, 108). These biologi-cal foundations as a social-emotional communication systems are suggested bythe social roles of music-like vocalizations in other species. Music has its basisin the subcortical affective expressive emotional system, a mammalian communi-cation system which provided the emotional regulation functions that consti-tuted the preadaptations from which a uniquely human musical capacity evolved.Dissanayake notes that there are other contributory factors to the foundationfor musicality. Selection pressures on the capacity for long-distance callingresulted from the need for cooperative communication, providing a basis for acapacity for rhythmic group chorusing and vocalizations that are at the basis ofour musical capacity (Merker 2009). Deeper evolutionary roots of musicalityare in our rhythmic impulse and the emotional dynamics of motion of the body.Our intrinsic rhythmic capacities are the expressions of a full-body capacityrelated to the inherent rhythm of bipedal movement. Music is the vocal comple-ment to the behavioral expression of mimesis, a vocal-cognitive shift that expandsthe communicative power of behavior; sound carries a signal further than sight atnight and in dense foliage. Music was at the basis of the coordination of themimetic capacity, where vocal learning of musical traditions provided a basis fortransmission of group culture, especially through ritual. Music was a core featureof our ancient ritual capacities that provided a basis for expressive sharing and thefoundations of culture.Merker (2009) notes that although other animals engage in cultural learning,it is humans alone that have ritual culture, one in which the arbitrary form ofdoing things is obligatory for social participation. This arbitrariness is illustratedin the forms of music and song, which provide a foundation for costly signals.Cross and Morley (2009) point to the unique power of music to enhance groupcohesion in a number of ways, including formation of group identity; synchroni-zation of behavior and cognition; and group catharsis, the expression and releaseof emotions. Music and its effects on emotions provide an intrinsic reward forengaging in these activities that enhance social functionality.264SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Effects on the individual include the ability of music to enhance hormonerelease, with effects on oxytocin, which enhances social bonds (see Pankseppand Trevarthen [2009]). These hormonal effects have both individual and collec-tive effects, coordinating and entraining the individual with the group. Theintrinsic pulse of music and its coordination effects on the group creates intuitivelinkages and a common sense of intentionality. The pulse that underlies rhythmcreates an inclusive sense of meaning derived from the experiences of music.Music provides a medium for metaphoric expression, a coordination ofdiverse expressive aspects (behavior, emotions, sound) that contributes to the for-mation of a coherent message or meaning that effects the participants.” [M]usiccan be interpreted as facilitating the formation of conceptual-intentional com-plexes across multiple domains of experience, providing a synthetic medium thatcan bind together the experiences of disparate situations and concepts” (Crossand Morley 2009, 70). Crowe (2004) reviews evidence that music manifests a com-plexity characterized by the emergent properties’ novel features that reflect a deeplevel of organization, functioning as a form of communication that goes beyondthe nonverbal expression of basic emotions, enabling it to express more developedforms of feelings.Music produces a social coordination that allows for the exchange ofinformation through diverse modalities (behavior, visual emotional expressions,emotional vocalizations) and must be seen as core to the evolution of the repre-sentational and therefore symbolic capacity. “Musical or protomusical behaviorhas the potential to make use of several cognitive capacities at once, relying onthe integration and control of biological, psychological, social and physical sys-tems; it gives the opportunity to practice and develop theseintegratedskills in acontext of limited risk” (Cross and Morley 2009, 77; emphasis added). Crossand Morley (77) emphasize the role of music in “integrating important cognitiveskills...[and] stimulation of fundamentally important human interactivecapacities.”Mimetic Origins of Art and ShamanismDonald (2006) places the human capacities of dance and music in the broadercontext of an underlying ability for artistic expression, which he views as aby-product of mimesis and “the ultimate refinement of the mimetic mode”(15). He characterizes art as part of the coevolution of cognition and culture, aprimordial expression of the cognitive capacities of mimesis that became a centralfeature of uniquely human mental capacities. Mimesis constituted “a single neu-rocognitive adaptation...[for] mime, imitation, gesture and the rehearsal ofskill” (15) that resulted from the cognitive elaboration of expressions of meaningbased in embodiment (behavior).The cognitive and evolutionary potentials of art are as a form of “cognitiveengineering...an activityintended to influence the minds of an audience” (4, italicsin original). This reflects a deep human tendency to engage in joint and reciprocalcontrol of attention and the experiences of others for purposes of social commu-nication. Here we see the continuity of displays and art and shamanism.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL265"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Donald considers these dramatic expressive manifestations that we call art tobe at the foundation of human cultural processes of distributed cognition, thelinkages among minds that hold a wealth of information in memory of experi-ence. Although he spoke of art rather than shamanism, his statements can beapplied equally to the shamanic model: “Art is constructivist in nature, aimed atthe deliberate refinement and elaboration of mental models and world views...theoutcome of the brain’s tendency to strive for the integration of perceptual andconceptual material over time. The termlarge-scale neural integrationrefers to thenervous system’s cross-modal unification of many sources of experience into asingle abstract model or percept” (Donald 2006, 4).Donald considers this capacity for large-scale integration to be the majoradaptive advantage acquired by our complex brains, permitting more abstractthought, a greater temporal and spatial complexity to behavior, and an abilityto manage future unfolding of complex and shifting social alliances. Art was acentral manifestation of this metacognitive capacity to engage self-reflectionand represent self-identifying symbols, especially of social groups. This capacity ofrepresentation through art had its first manifestations in the ritual expressionsof our ancient hominin ancestors, who gave rise to a new cultural level, theMimetic culture, nearly 2 million years ago; this expressive capacity continued tobe the primary medium for the eventual evolution of the Mythic cultures of earlyanatomically modern humans (Donald).Donald’s models of the Mimetic and Mythic cultures give us a framework forunderstanding the emergence of shamanism in the expressive capacities of Mimeticculture. With Mimetic culture, the display capacities of hominids are superseded ina new expressive level of mimesis not found in developed forms in our ape cousins.The Mimetic domain allowed for the expression of an archaic level of homininculture based on “gesturing, pantomime, dance, visual analogy, and ritual” (8).This, combined with the drumming elements and music, was the manifestationsof a uniquely human religiosity and spirituality in early hominin shamanism. Here,shamanic ritual created the enactive context for the expression of a cognized uni-verse that expanded the shared conceptual frameworks of our ancient forbearersand created a system of shared meaning for the foundations of culture.Donald reverses earlier characterizations of mimesis as a modular capacityin saying it meets Fodor’s (1983) criteria for a nonmodular adaptation.It is nonmodular precisely because it can work in any domain—perceptual,motor, auditory—to communicate information. It is the general basis for sym-bolicintegration.“[T]hedomainsofartultimatelyreflecttheentireevolvedstructure of the human cognitive-cultural system” (20). This capacity was thecontext in which shamanism led us to the archaic human culture stage and thenturned us into culturally modern humans.SPIRIT ASSUMPTIONS AS ADAPTIVE MECHANISMSThe experience of what is interpreted as the spirit world is a fundamental aspectof shamanic practice; consciousness is altered to enter into contact with the spiritworld, which is the source of shamanic knowledge and power. These experiences266SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"include the spirit “other,” as well as the spiritual dimension of the self, exempli-fied in soul flight. These spirit beliefs have been considered an “irrational com-mitment” that demonstrates allegiance to the group. But as shown in the reviewof the basic elements of consciousness, spirit assumptions are natural, derivedfrom adaptive skills and assumptions. The exaptation of personal and social rep-resentations of self and others in spirit beliefs extends these original cognitive andsocial functions. These spirit concepts may, however, have more ancient originsin the dominance hierarchies of the ancient reptilian brain (see Ernandes andGiammanco 1998; Winkelman and Baker 2008).Atran (2006) pointed out that the social functions of religion do not predictthe cognitive characteristics of religion, in particular, the cultural universality andpredominance of supernatural agents, specific features of supernatural agents, thevalidation of supernatural agent concepts in ways immune to logical and factualscrutiny, and the compulsion to amoral order that inhibits defection. The inabil-ity of social functional arguments to account for the universal features of spiritbeliefs indicate “that social functions are not phylogenetically responsible forthe cognitive structure and cultural recurrence of religion” (Atran, 185).While Atran noted that there is good evidence that religious beliefs andpractices have the functional ability to alleviate stress and anxiety, enhance socialcohesion and reduce conflict, he nonetheless discounted these as evidence of evolu-tionary adaptation by characterizing them instead as a cultural by-product ofhumans’ evolved cognitive, emotional, and social qualities. Atran’s perspective wasthat religious beliefs survive because of their ability to accommodate to our folk psy-chology and its “theory of mind” that is a core aspect of supernatural agent concepts.Atran argued that a supernatural commitment helps maintain stable communities,but, nonetheless, considered religion to be a by-product rather than an adaptation.Are there adaptive aspects of supernatural belief beyond the “agency detection,”“interpersonal belongingness,” and “theory of mind” abilities found in behaviorsof other animals? Does the supernatural assumption involve more than the theory ofmind and other ordinary processes involved in how people explain phenomena? Dospirit beliefs take this capacity to infer the mental states of others and exapt them innew ways, providing new functional adaptations? Or in contrast, do spirit conceptsmerely represent previous capabilities? I propose that the functions of spirits providemore than the prior features of personal and social identity and theory of mind,using those prior traits for new purposes, an exaptation that results in a new levelof adaptation (Winkelman and Baker 2008).This is in direct contrast to the dominant perspectives that have character-ized religion as involving by-products and complex side effects (see Deacon andCashman [2009] for review). Deacon and Cashman reject the dominant scientifictheories regarding religious universals, characterizing them as inappropriatelyreductive in treating religious thought and spiritual experiences as incidental,epiphenomena or corrupted predispositions of capacities that originally evolvedfor different purposes. These approaches overlook theemergentcharacter of theseexperiences and their personal and social value, the importance of ultimatemeaning in the transformational experiences, and the psychological and socialfunctions they fulfill.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL267"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The Supernatural and the SymbolicOur evolved agency detection devices may account for the perception of inten-tional agents, but not as well for other qualities of the supernatural, such as theircounterintuitive properties. These properties of spirit entities that do not con-form to human limitations involve an expanded set of behavioral capacities(“supernatural abilities”). Spirit concepts provide adaptations in enhancingaccess to intuitive and unconscious thought processes that are externalized andrepresented symbolically such as in visions and spirits (Winkelman and Peek2004). The human unconscious and its wisdom are given a certain control overdecision making, externalized in the concepts of spirits. The counter-intuitiveproperties of religious beliefs are adaptive in spite of their contradictions withfactual knowledge because they provide possibilities not derived directly fromour innate capabilities and modules.Atran tried to sidestep this conclusion by suggesting that this “bypasses ourhardwiring to form counterintuitive religious beliefs...through the cognitiveprocess ofmetarepresentation” (194). The outcome of metarepresentation issymbolic processes that allow us to think about and represent one thing in termsof another. Atran pointed to the adaptations involved in spirit concepts in notingthat “[s]upernatural ideas always remain metarepresentational...[and] allowpeople to entertain, recognize and evaluate the differences between true and falsebeliefs...to both generate and recognize false beliefs in others [that] would favorsurvival” (195, 196). If it favors survival, whether its assumptions are right orwrong, it is an adaptation.Deacon (1997, 2002; Deacon and Cashman 2009) analyzes the interrelation-ships among symbols, evolutionary processes, and spiritual traditions. Thecreative and emergent character of evolutionary processes provide perspectivesfor understanding the spiritual in terms of the properties of humans’ symboliccapacities. Deacon and Cashman link human’s spiritual predisposition to theevolution of human’s unique symbolic abilities that provide distinctive cognitiveand emotional predispositions. These predispositions involve: understandingthe universe and personal identity in narrative terms; a conceptualization of theworld as involving hidden meanings that involve a level of meaning more funda-mental than mundane experience; and emergent emotional experiences that pro-vide the source of transcendent and spiritual experiences. Symbolic capacitiesproduce a drive to create self-narratives and to look for hidden meanings.Human cultural universals postulating a hidden spiritual or supernatural realitythat underlies the phenomenal world of experience is a consequence of our irre-pressible tendency to see things as symbols. Since symbolic references acquiretheir meanings from a system of relationships among signifiers, the source ofmeaning is in essence unseen, found within an invisible conceptual worldof interdependent signifiers.Religion contributes to production of transcendental experience and novelmeanings and values by expanding humans’ perspectives beyond those producedby biology, personal reference and mundane experiences. These experiences asemergent in that they are not presaged in our evolved psychological mechanisms.268SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Religious experiences involve an emergent character in which our symboliccapacities fundamentally reframe life experience by radically reorganizing cogni-tive processes and emotional experience in reference to spirit “other.” Religiousexperiences are centrally emotional in character, and the emotional qualities aredirectly related to development of character and values.Social species understand reality through information derived from others,the perceptions in their minds. We acquired a capacity for a theory of mindbecause it facilitates social communication and organization. Symbols expandthis ability to reveal and access minds and their intents. In constructing theseviews of others, symbols provide a substrate from which one can maintain aware-ness of the indexical information that produces an experience of what the other’sperspective would be like. Symbols are required to mediate this double-referentialrelationship involved in the ability to form representations of another’s mentalexperience. The symbolic capacity and its manifestation in spirit beliefs provideadaptations to expand awareness of others and their knowledge and intents.The adaptive advantages of understanding and using symbolic relationshipshave derived from broader evolved predispositions to seek patterns and look forreasons for what we perceive. This search goes beyond the obvious surfacefeatures to find the “behind the scene” causes and actors. Our deep insatiable ten-dency to find meaning leads us to examine patterns in the natural world as dis-plays of cryptic messages, symbols from an unseen communicator. This unseencommunicator is the spirit assumption; these presumed, unseen but sensed,meaning-makers and actors are the source of the spiritual.The symbolic and spiritual are intrinsically intertwined. True symbolicreference is not intrinsic to the representation, its form or sound, nor is it foundwithin the mechanisms of the brain; rather, symbolic reference is found in anassociational network of meanings entertained by minds of a cultural and linguis-tic community. It is not a physical reality but an imagined one with its meaningsderived from a social context.This experience of immaterial meaning constitutes a foundation of our expe-rience of significant butdisembodied spirits and their immortal qualities. Thesymbol systems that underlie our quest for understanding derive their meaningfrom referents to others and their imagined minds, disembodied and imaginedabstractions such as the spirit world. Theperennial referential other requiredfor symbolism creates the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent properties ofthe supernatural.Deacon suggested that the human intuition that we have of some aspect ofour self or our mind that exists independent of our body, the disembodied soulsthat survive a bodily death, is the kind of experience of self produced throughsymbols, a kind of a virtual independence of identity from the corporeal basisof our existence. It must reflect in important respects the lower level iconic andindexical forms of representation in the visual substratum, where motor neuronslink our experience and bodily self with the visual representations of others’behaviors. And it was in freeing our understanding from this bodily based foun-dation of knowing that the shamanic out-of-body soul flight gave rise to a signifi-cant evolution of human consciousness.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL269"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"These symbolic capacities free one from the constraints of the here and now(embodied iconic and indexical thought), allowing imagined goals to take prec-edence over the immediate context in guiding adaptive behaviors. Symbolicrepresentations extended experiences in virtual reference, using the evolved pro-cesses of mind to use internalized abstract models to engage in the processes oftrial and error learning and in extrapolating different possible circumstances.This achieved something beyond the capacities of genetic evolution, a risk-freeengagement of different possibilities and the consequent capacity for forethoughtand extended planning.These capacities to experience the world apart from the body referentexpanded in the context of the shamanic OBE, or soul flight. The capacity forself-representation provided through mimesis gave an embodied sense of self-consciousness that constituted a preadaptation for the experiences of a disembod-ied self. The self of the OBE is made possible by the symbolic capacity operatingthrough the representations provided by the body. We must have an embodiedself before we can have an out-of-body self.Brereton (2000) analyzed these adaptive aspects of shamanism in relation tothe capacities of dreaming that are exapted in shamanic rituals. Dreams involverepresentations of self in emotionally salient space, a process of “virtual scenarioconstruction” that provides processes for risk-free construction and examinationof options. This symbolic dream capacity is elicited in visionary states that weredesigned to engage these modeling processes to enhance personal awareness andsocial adaptations, using the visual symbolic modality as a workspace for explor-ing different scenarios with enhanced access to unconscious information.Atran pointed out that supernatural agent concepts are particularly effectivein triggering the powerful emotions associated with evolutionary survival tem-plates, making them memorable and compelling. More significantly, Deaconand Cashman (2009) explain how the transcendent and mystical experiencesinvolve the capacities of symbols to produce uniquely human emotions throughtheir interaction with symbolic processes. The emotional qualities associated withmystical and transcendent experiences such as awe, equanimity and self-transcendence depend on symbolic representation and are emergent in that theyare produced in the interaction among basic cognitive-emotional processes.Symbolic mediation generates new modes of experience that are different fromthe more basic component emotions, producing higher-order novelty that is dis-continuous with and even in contradiction to the properties of the lower levelcomponents. Symbols can fuse ideas and emotions that fall outside the range ofnormal neurological processes, melding what are naturally mutually exclusiveemotions based in antagonistic brain systems, producing novel experiences inconjoint activation of what are normally incompatible emotions. These concep-tual juxtapositions are symbolic blends that are not merely additive, but producea novel synergestic interaction. These are the self-transcending aspects of reli-gious experiences that supersede immediate experience, and provide expandedcognitive integration and emotional synergy.The argument that shamanism and other religious behaviors are not adapta-tions but functionless by-products would require establishing that the religious270SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"behavior was based solely on the prior adaptations design to meet other needsand that they do not enhance survival and reproduction. But religion is well-noted for its ability to assist in coping, providing a collective process for engagingwith our existential needs for security and our inevitable anxieties such as fear ofdeath. Religion and the supernatural premise constitute effective adaptations formanaging human emotional and cognitive dilemmas and expanding ourcapacities for emotional and cognitive processing. This poses a challenge to theview that religion is merely an evolutionary byproduct.SHAMANISM AND HUMAN EVOLUTIONReligious beliefs and practices include a variety of social, emotional, and cognitivecapabilities that provide a range of preadaptations for shamanism. For instance,our ability to relate to supernatural beings exapts a variety of preexisting socialand cognitive skills designed to enable us to function effectively in relationshipsto the diverse roles found within a complex social group. The extent to whichthese prior adaptations embodied in religious beliefs provide a new adaptationdepends on whether these cognitive mechanisms perform exactly the same func-tions in religiosity. Religious beliefs and practices constitute an exaptation to theextent that they provide new adaptive capabilities beyond those prior adaptations.In so far as the supernatural premise enables humans to deal effectively with exis-tential anxieties (such as death) not addressed by previous cognitive adaptations,the supernatural premise constitutes an adaptation. To the extent that shamanicpractices of totemism enable us to expand our kin-based biases and preferencesto include others, producing larger more effectively integrated social groups,shamanism provides an adaptation. To the extent that shamanic practices suchas visionary experiences engage cognitive processes and possibilities beyondour ordinary experiences of the waking mode of consciousness, they provide anadaptation.The roles of shamanism as adaptations must be assessed in terms of how theyfacilitated the reproduction and survival of individuals and groups. Conceptual-izing shamanism’s origins in ritual provides a broader context for assessing theexaptations of prior adaptations for new adaptive functions that meet the needsof larger integrated social groups (Winkelman and Baker 2008). The biologicalsolutions to cooperative living have their roots in the role of ritual in enhancingcooperation and reducing conflict in animal society. These ancient phylogeneticorigins of shamanism in ritual have been expanded to meet the needs of largerand more complex social groups. In this sense, we can say that not only shaman-ism but all of religion involves exaptations related to the capacity of ritual toenhance social and individual integration. To the extent that shamanic ritualsprovide survival-related functions beyond that embodied in the rituals of otheranimals, shamanic rituals constitute new adaptations. Although exaptations(the use of a prior trait for a new function) are often thought to imply a lack ofbiological evolution (e.g., see Kirkpatrick 2005), exaptations are also forms ofbiological evolution (see Buss et al. [1998]; Wildman [2006]). If a trait associatedwith those previously acquired through natural selection undergoes furtherEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL271"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"selection to meet a new functional goal, or to do so more effectively, then it is aproduct of biological evolution.Preadaptations and Evolutionary Developmentsof Shamanic HealingThe religious healing impulse has a range of preadaptations that shamanismexapted, extending their effectiveness by merging prior adaptations withcapacities provided by symbolic processes. This produced a new level of humanadaptation in which religious concepts played a central role in healing. Centralto the healing capacity were a range of primate preadaptations, including1. phylogenetic functional adaptations manifested in animal rituals used forgroup coordination;2. mammalian opioid-attachment systems and community bonding processes;3. use of elements of emotional vocalizations to affect others;4. capacities of hypnotizability found in animals as a mechanism for stressmanagement; and5. nighttime drumming sessions used to integrate dispersed daytimesubgroups.These commonalities in chimpanzee displays and shamanic rituals point to thebiological and evolutionary roots of religious healing practices in these ancientcommunity rituals. The biogenetic functions of ritual as communication andsocial coordination capacities were selectively shaped to enhance collective cer-emonies that contributed to the alteration of consciousness. These experiencesengage the uniquely human innate representational modules, structures, andcognitive processes to produce symbolic thought in metaphors that facilitatedsocial and psychological integration. Shamanism resulted from adaptive strate-gies for integrating a variety of capacities—biological, social, and cognitive—thatcontributed to human adaptation and survival.The universal aspects of shamanic ritual reflect biological bases as adapta-tions and exaptations. Shamanism extended the capacities of ritual practices tointegrate members of the group and produce endogenous healing responses; sha-manic practices also stimulated new cognitive features (such as animal identitiesfor self and society) that produced symbolic capabilities such as the beliefs inthe spirit world, and their roles in internal psychological dynamics and personalrelations with others in society. These aspects of shamanic cognition that involveexaptations of prior cognitive systems include:•Detecting animacy and agency, intentional causal agents with personalities;•Representations of social others as ideal models;•Recognition of social others and making inferences about their mental states;•Distinguishing animal species and their natural characteristics and tendencies;272SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"•Representation through use of the body and animals as metaphoricsystems; and•The capacity for self-recognition and representation through internalizationof the “other.”Evolutionary exaptations of shamanism in particular and religion in generalderive from•Expanding the ancient phylogenetic bases of nighttime group rituals toinvolve all-night rituals with dramatic expansions in music, dancing, anddrumming;•Expansion of community bonding rituals that healed through eliciting theancient opioid-attachment mechanisms and exerting selective pressures forenhanced opioid systems and placebo responses;•Elaborate mimetic enactments that expressed a mythic order and spiritworld;•Alterations of consciousness that produced experiences of the spirit worldsuch as the soul flight or the “vision quest” through exaptations of the cog-nitive processes involved in dreaming;•Exapting animal representation systems as symbols of spirits and theirpowers, providing mechanisms for identity transformation by using spiritsfor personal and social identity;•Healing practices that engage a variety of social and symbolic processes thatproduce psychological well-being through expansion of placebo and hyp-notic responses;•Management of death fears through the use of altered state self-representationsas evidence of soul and afterlife; and•Creating integrative forms of thought based in analogical representation sys-tems produced by altered states and through integration of innate modulesin bodily and visual modalities (Winkelman and Baker 2008).Hubbard (2002) pointed out that shamanism exploits a number of genericstructures and processes of human thought reflected in contemporary cognitivescience views of the world. Current connectionist models of semantic memoryreflect the shamanic “web of life” model that emphasizes the interconnectednessand interdependence of all life forms and interrelations among species. Self-awareness and psychological integration areenhanced by this view of complexlinkages among all aspects of the natural world, including humans and the per-sonal self. Contact with nature enhances this view of interconnectedness withnature, and with input from the environment forming the structures of the neu-ral networks of memory, this makes the structures of the natural worldfundamental to and isomorphic with the representations of vision and spatialperception. Hubbard discussed this interconnectedness as a shamanic awarenessof the web of life, a principle that alsoreflects the connectivity underlying theoperations of the brain and memory formation.EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL273"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Shamanic cognition emphasizes special attributes of human consciousnessinvolving the extension of meaning and intentionality to objects and the naturalworld (Hubbard 2003). Humans tend to assume something is a rational agentwith mental states, beliefs, and desires when lacking adequate knowledge aboutthe properties of its design to explain its behavior. The “intentional stance,” theattribution of mental states, desires, and beliefs to something else, goes beyonda “physical stance” of attributing expectations regarding behavior by an object.This extension includes understanding phenomena of the natural world in termsof the dynamics of people and their interpretations and interactions. Hubbardnotes that shamanism’s extension of intentionality into the natural world resultsin an expansion of the “in-group,” considering the unknown others of nature tobe basically like self. This creates a greater sense of connection with the world, andby extension, with others who participate in shamanic practices. Religions alsogenerally have a moral dimension that encourages social evaluation and “coali-tion thinking” that separates the world into “us” versus “them.” This exploitsthe social cognitive orientation involving a tendency to attribute meaning andperceive random events as constituting meaningful wholes.There is also the basic principle of psychointegration, an enhanced function-ing of the brain that makes us more aware of systemic interconnectedness. Theseconnections are enhanced by the psychointegrative properties of psychedelics,which reinforce the experience of the correctness of perceptions that emerge fromthe unconscious structures of the world and brain into consciousness by virtue oftheir iconic similarity. In visionary experiences, these images have implicit codingof information retrieved from the unconscious and transferred to awareness. Theaccess to natural world structures provides a basis for information not ordinarilyavailable to consciousness, and may also produce a general heightened awarenessby increased access to various channels of physical information normallyexcluded because of habituation. Image-based natural world structures provideaccess to evolutionarily earlier structures of the brain and their learning andmemory processes.Perhaps we find the most significant adaptive capacity integrated into theshamanic complex in the shaman’s renowned function as a visionary and aprophet. This ancient visionary engagement with knowledge of the world hasbeen conceptualized in contemporary psychology as mental time travel. Berntsenand Jacobsen (2009) found that spontaneous mental time travel to possiblefuture events is as common as autobiographical recollection (memories of thepersonal past), but differing in involving more positive features. The finding ofArzy et al. that this mental time travel capacity is more related to projection ofthe self into future events (rather than the past) indicates that our “time travel”capacity primarily reflects selection for mental processing of future predictionsand rapid decision making regarding anticipated behaviors. This mental timetravel appears to be a uniquely human capacity based on its heavy dependenceon episodic memory, with “obvious implications for problem solving, self under-standing and maintenance of social bonds” (Berntsen and Jacobsen, 1103). Thismental time travel ability is linked to synesthesias and is a widespread rather thanrare phenomenon (Mann, Korzenko, Carriere, and Dixon 2009). These phenomena274SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"characterized by the ability tofuse spatial and temporal sources provide anadaptive advantage, as those with greater synesthesias had greater abilitiesin manipulating time-based information. Thus synaesthesia provides benefits inmental time travel, looking forward to possible future events, a capacity whichunderlies and expands on the ability to plan.One of the exceptional features of the modern human brain is the ability todetach its abstract functions and enter into all sorts of alternative worlds—past,present, future, or totally imaginary. And while we enter into this dislocated uni-verses through mental time travel, our bodies are capable of maintaining invol-untary organic and behavioral functions, even allowing us to walk, run, and in amoment, reorient and respond to immediate danger. A linkage between of imagi-native capacities our brain and what we need to stay alive reflects the power ofconsciousness of our ancient brains.The idea that shamanism derives from or reflects some mental or psychologicaldysfunction has been expressed across the centuries. The hypotheses are numer-ous, and most do not deserve the consideration they have been given. Whitley(2009) reviews persistent evidence of a manic-depressive tendency in shamanicinitiates, as well as developed shamans. He further notes that shamans whileshamans are nonetheless often well ajusted, there is reason to think that theymay suffer from these conditions associated with dopamine and serotonin defi-ciencies. Since shamanic activities and practices have the effect of elevating theseneurotransmitter levels, we can continue to reject the pathologizations ofshamanism. In contrast, we can understand the responses of shamanism as healthoriented, the outcome of an integrative impulse, manifested in mirror neurons,alterations of consciousness, and the ritual and visionary integration of a diversi-fied self. These capacities are manifested in and driven by mimesis, a central fea-ture of human cognitive evolution that was exploited in shamanism. Mimesis isan ancient driver of multiple integrative mechanisms still epitomized in coreshamanistic drumming and dancing today.Previc’s (2009) analyses of the interaction of our dopaminergic system andexecutive intelligence in evolution illustrate the central role of shamanic practicesin general human cognitive evolution. Many shamanic activities, from psyche-delics to behavioral activities, enhance the dopamine system. The dopamine sys-tem facilitates operations of goal-directed motor programming and motivationand associations making reward predictions, processes that are specifically adap-tive in acquiring distant reward objects. These distant rewards require operationsthat take place in extrapersonal space rather than in relationship to the objects ofour immediate peripersonal space. Our strategic intellectual skills and capacitiesare associated with an internal locus-of-control, a sense of being in control ofone’s own fate. This dopaminergically-mediated behavior requires a cognitiveinhibition of extraneous thoughts, sympathetic emotional responses, and theimmediate presence of the physical body; these inhibitions are based on a para-sympathetic action, which is caused by dopamine, and who’s effects producemajor features of ASC. The dopaminergic-induced effects engage a human abilityto produce abstract representations found in the shamanic out-of-body andtime-travel, as well as distant conceptualizations such as spirit worlds, heavensEVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF SHAMANIC RITUAL275"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"and hells, and the eternity of the soul. These spirit world-conceptions representagent concepts that operate with an expanded human brain and cognitive capac-ity that enhanced our ability to explore distant regions of physical space (Previc2009). They also provide mechanism through which we explored the intimatespaces of our mental capacities and our personal and social identities.CONCLUSIONSThe shamanic capacity far exceeds the ritualized behaviors of chimpanzees, butthe substantial homologies between ape displays and humans’ shamanic ritualsindicate their evolutionary origins in the behaviors shared with our hominidancestors. The hominid baselines of altruism were expanded over hominin evolu-tion to provide healing practices derived fromthe enhanced effects of symbolsand meaning, building on susceptibility to hypnotic engagement, suggestibility,and placebo responses. Shamanism integrated these and other qualities of amammalian caring heritage into community ritual practices that provided heal-ing and enhanced survival through a variety of mechanisms. These included•eliciting the visionary experiences as representations of the outcome ofunconscious mental processes;•bonding together different groups in alliances for food and protection;•expanding the psychosomatic capacities for healing;•social therapies involving community participation and social symbol sys-tems engaging self development and the mammalian attachment dynamics;•psychological and self-therapies engaging spirits as psychocultural systemsand representations of innate psychological dynamics of the self representedin animal spirits; and•symbolic-psychophysiological dynamics from ritual manipulation of emo-tions, self-structures, and the nervous system.Among other features that have contributed to humans’ evolved capacity forreligiosity are the effects of enhanced opioid-mediated bonding; the environmen-tal influences of psilocybin-containing mushrooms; and the side-effects ofbipedalism, specifically long-distance running. Notably, none of these featureswere selected for because of intrinsically religious qualities. Consequently, itappears that our religious experiences began as side-effects of adaptive processes.The religious behaviors such as ritual healing practices nonetheless involvedadaptations. The interpretations of the experiential reality of altered consciousnessin spirit concepts also enabled a new level of symbolic adaptation for molding theself and society. Shamanism is an adaptive framework for ritual management ofmany aspects of human consciousness. The central role of shamanic principles inthe ritual activities of the cultural explosion of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transi-tion indicates that shamanism both preceded and contributed to the developmentof our modern symbolic capacity.The idea that shamanic practices reflect cultural selection and, hence, are nomore than a complex by-product of cultural forces, faces the challenge of the276SHAMANISM"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"cross-cultural similarities in manifestations of shamanism. If they were the conse-quences of cultural selection, rather than an interaction between biology and theenvironment, shamanism would not have been found in such remarkably similarforms across societies in the premodern world. The cross-cultural manifestationsdirectly contradict the hypothesis of cultural selection; instead, we have in sha-manism an ecologically specific adaptation of hunter-gatherer societies to innatepotentials that reflect exaptations of an ancient primate capacity for ritual.The collective effects of shamanic ritual practices imply an effect of groupselection in our ancient past. Those groups capable of exapting the ancient hom-inid bases of collective rituals for more effective group solidarity would have beenmore effective in acquiring social support to survive and reproduce. The neteffect was an ancient hominin population in which the capacity for ritualenhancement of well-being was a common feature of humanity. It is at our indi-vidual and collective peril that we ignore these health-enhancing aspects of ourbiological, social and psychological nature.NOTE1.

Winkelman spent most of his career studying the biologicalbases for traditional healing practices, especially shamanism. His research hasfocused principally on the cross-cultural patterns of shamanism (e.g.,Shamans,Priests and Witches[1992]) and identifying the biological bases of shamanic univer-sals and associated altered states of consciousness. His studies of shamanic practicesled him to a reconceptualization of the so-called hallucinogens as “psychointegra-tors,” reflecting their effects of integrating normally unconscious processes intoconsciousness. He coedited the two-volumePsychedelic Medicine(2007), whichexamines the applications of shamanism and psychointegrators to contemporaryhealth problems, especially addictions. Winkelman examined the evolutionary ori-gins of religion in his coauthoredSupernatural as Natural: A Biocultural Theory ofReligion(with John Baker, 2008) and addressed the applications of shamanisticand anthropological principles in medicine, nursing, and public health inCultureand Health: Applying Medical Anthropology(2008). Winkelman served as presidentof the Anthropology of Consciousness section of the American AnthropologicalAssociation and was the founding president of its Anthropology of Religion section.He retired from the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at ArizonaState University in 2009 and moved to the central highlands of Brazil, where he isestablishing intentional communities based on principles of conservation, perma-culture, and natural healing.
