The IndustrialRevolution launched in Britain a century before had leapt across the EnglishChannel in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and transformed France into one ofthe world’s major economic powers. French scientists were on the cutting edge ofscores of rapidly advancing fields of knowledge; railroads and telegraph linesspread across the French landscape; in the cafés of bustling Paris, members ofthe comfortable middle class could sit back, sip café au lait, and readup-to-date news reports from the front lines of the Crimean War and the TaipingRebellion.To many French people, the world seemed in that year to be marching steadilyforwards into a new era of progress and modernity, with western Europe in thevanguard and France, by many measures, out in front of the other Europeannations. Yet this was the year that a previously obscure French writerpublished, under the pen name Eliphas Lévi, a book titled Doctrine of High Magic(Dogme de la haute magie). A sequel, Ritual of High Magic (Rituel de la hautemagie), appeared the next year, and a single-volume edition that included bothbooks found its way into print one year later. Nor did these publicationslanguish in obscurity—quite the contrary. The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magicbrought Lévi immediate fame and played a key role in kick-starting a revival ofmagic that remains a significant cultural presence today. Though modernoccultism has many sources and streams, a surprisingly large number of them canbe traced back to these works of Lévi’s busy pen.[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]Eliphas Lévi’s real name was Alphonse Louis Constant. A shoemaker’s son, he wasborn in Paris in 1810, when the Napoleonic Wars were at their height. He was afrail and studious child with strong religious feelings, and his parentsencouraged him to study for the Catholic priesthood. His piety and intellectualgifts impressed his teachers to such an extent that once he became a deacon, hewas appointed to a teaching position at the Petit Séminaire de Paris, aprestigious Catholic school.This apparent stroke of luck proved fatal to his career in the church, however.Assigned to teach the catechism to a class of young women, he promptly fell inlove with one of his pupils. While he did not act on the attraction, theexperience convinced him that he was not suited for a celibate life, and he leftthe seminary before being ordained. Thereafter, he supported himself by avariety of odd jobs while making his first efforts towards a career as a writer.France in the first half of the nineteenth century was wracked by politicalturmoil, with royalist supporters of the house of Bourbon, imperialistsupporters of the heirs of Napoleon, republican proponents of the ideals of theRevolution, and the first wave of proponents of modern socialism among the manyforces at work in the political smorgasbord of those years. Lévi was inevitablydrawn into political journalism and proceeded to write his first major work, TheBible of Liberty (La bible de la liberté), which saw print in 1841. The Frenchgoverning powers found plenty of objectionable material in this manifesto ofChristian socialism; it was confiscated by the Paris police an hour after itwent on sale, and Constant was arrested. His trial and eleven-month prisonsentence, on a charge of inciting insurrection, afforded him his first realpublic exposure.The years that followed saw Constant leading the ordinary life of an aspiringwriter of the era: taking on an assortment of literary jobs to pay the billswhile pursuing his own studies and a diverse range of interests during his offhours. Socialist journalism took up much of his time, but he also put hisconsiderable knowledge of theology and Catholic tradition to good use, penning asubstantial Dictionary of Christian Literature that remained in print for manyyears. In 1846 he married Noémie Cadiot, a talented young sculptor and author,but the marriage proved unsuccessful and they separated in 1853.By that time Constant’s studies had begun to move in unexpected directions. By1839 he was a friend of Alphonse Esquiros, a romantic novelist interested inoccultism, and it may have been contact with Esquiros and his circle that ledConstant to begin reading forgotten tomes on magic and alchemy. He continuedwriting socialist tracts for a time, but his unsuccessful campaign for a seat inthe newly constituted National Assembly, after the revolution of 1848, proved tobe the last hurrah of his activist phase. From that point on, he was on thetrack of something different—and more profound.In 1853 he met the most important of his occult teachers. Jósef MariaHoëné-Wroński was at once one of the most brilliant and most eccentric figuresin nineteenth-century French intellectual life: the inventor of Wronskiandeterminants—still much used in the study of differential equations—and of thecaterpillar tread used to this day for tanks, bulldozers, and the like. Born inPoland in 1776, Wroński distinguished himself in the Polish cause when thatcountry was conquered by the Russians and Germans. By 1800 he was, along withmany other Polish exiles, in France, where he devoted himself to a variety ofabstruse studies for the rest of his life. Occultism was only one of his manyinterests, but most of his later books focus on it increasingly, expounding anintricate system of thought derived from the Cabala, the ancient Jewishtradition of esoteric philosophy. Constant met Wroński just before the latter’sdeath, but their brief acquaintance had a profound impact on the younger man.It was apparently Wroński who showed Constant that the magical and alchemicalwritings he had encountered first by way of Alphonse Esquiros and his circlewere not merely romantic curiosities but embodied a philosophy of life and a wayof understanding the world that had not lost any of its relevance with thecoming of the modern, up-to-date culture of the 1850s. That realizationtransformed Constant’s life. Before long, he was devoting all his spare time tooccult study and practice—a detail that may have had more than a little to dowith the failure of his marriage—and assembling the first drafts of the bookthat would be his masterpiece. To distance this new work from his earlierwriting, he adopted a pen name that was simply his own name loosely translatedinto Hebrew: Eliphas Lévi Zahed, or, for short, Eliphas Lévi.The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic was an immediate success, and in more thana financial sense. Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who was born in 1865 andgrew up in a milieu powerfully shaped by Lévi’s influence, reminisced in a 1917book that in his youth, “one met everywhere young men of letters who talked ofmagic.”1 [9781101992746_EPUB-3_fn1.xhtml] He was not exaggerating; from 1856until the outbreak of the First World War, occultism was a massive presence notonly in French culture but throughout Europe and America, and the revival ofmagic in those years sowed plenty of seeds that sprouted anew in the occult boomthat got under way in the wake of the 1960s. Many others contributed to therebirth of occultism, but Lévi was the most important of the first generation ofoccult authors, the one who proved that it was possible to restate the oldteachings of magic in modern language and introduce them to a mass market.Constant’s life after the publication of Dogme et rituel de la haute magie wasas placid as the years before it had been tempestuous. He lived quietly inrented apartments in Paris, writing and corresponding with an extensive circleof admirers and students. Further books on magic appeared at regularintervals—History of Magic (Histoire de la magie) in 1860, The Key to the GreatMysteries (La clef des grands mystères) in 1861, Fables and Symbols (Fables etsymboles) in 1862, and The Science of Spirits (La science des esprits) in1865—all of them developing and restating the insights introduced in TheDoctrine and Ritual of High Magic. He died in 1875 after a short illness.[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]Even today, more than a century and a half after Constant’s alter ego EliphasLévi burst on the scene, those who speak of magic as anything but a collectionof discarded superstitions can expect reactions that range from blankincomprehension to reflexive contempt. Thus the first question that has to beasked and answered about Lévi’s work, and especially his first and mostinfluential book—the one you now hold in your hands—is this: what exactly doesmagic have to offer to a world that, at least in theory, has left the MiddleAges behind?We can begin to answer that question by sketching out four core themes of Lévi’sapproach to magic.First, living amid the smoking ruins left behind by the eighteenth century’scult of reason, Lévi rejected the Enlightenment’s blind faith in the omnipotenceof the human intellect. The philosophes of the age of Voltaire and Rousseau hadassumed as a matter of course that the replacement of traditional faith withrational understanding would lead to a glorious future of constant improvement,but their efforts instead opened the way to the chaos of the Revolution, themass bloodshed of the Terror and the Napoleonic Wars, decades of politicalturmoil, and finally a despotism under Napoleon III that was, at best, noimprovement on the corrupt autocracy of the overthrown Bourbon kings. Theblowback of the Enlightenment project led a great many French intellectuals ofLévi’s time to reject rationality out of hand and look for salvation in anassortment of deliberately irrational options.Lévi himself was not among these. His position was far more nuanced. He arguedthat human understanding was certainly capable of knowing some things about thecosmos, and insisted that where accurate knowledge was possible facts shouldtake precedence over faith. He had no time for the sort of fundamentalism thatclings to the literal truth of traditional beliefs in the teeth of compellingevidence. He pointed out, though, that a great many things cannot be known byhuman reason and that some of these are enormously important in terms of theirimpact on human existence.Faith, for Lévi, begins where reason can go no further. This rule applies justas much to the die-hard rationalist skeptic as it does to the devout Christian;neither one, after all, can carry out a complete, objective inventory of thethings that exist in order to determine whether God is among them, and so thestatements “there is a God” and “there is no God” are equally matters of faith.For that matter, the rationalist claim that human beings ought to make choiceson the basis of reason, rather than any other criterion, isn’t a statement offact but, rather, a value judgment that rests on a galaxy of (usually)unexamined preconceptions every bit as resistant to objective proof as thetheological claims of the believer.Since every claim that can be made about things human beings cannot know is asfaith based as any other, Lévi argued, the sensible course is to choose a faiththat does not contradict anything that is known to be true about the world andyet appeals to those other human capacities—particularly the aesthetic sense andthe needs of the heart—with which reason is not well equipped to deal. As aRoman Catholic by birth and training, Lévi found that faith in the RomanCatholic Church, and even the most cursory reading of the book that follows willshow how often he turns to the Bible, and especially to the words of Jesus, as asource of guidance and inspiration. His approach to the Catholic Church and itsteachings, however, had little in common with the sort of rigid literalism thathas become standard issue in so much of the modern religious scene.This brings us to the second of Lévi’s four themes. The philosophes of theEnlightenment had argued that Christianity must be nonsense because Christianbeliefs, taken in a purely literal sense, contradict known facts about theworld. Voltaire’s scornful dismissal of the Catholic Church—“Écrasez l’infâme!”(Smash the wretched thing!)—drew heavily on the assumption that all religiouslanguage must be taken in its most pigheadedly literal sense. Two other writerswho influenced Lévi profoundly, Charles-François Dupuis and Constantin-Françoisde Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney, carried out their own attempted demolition ofChristianity on a similar basis; they argued that the narratives central toChristian faith had to be false because they paralleled mythological narrativesin other faiths, particularly those of classical Greek and Roman religion—andthese they assumed, as a matter of course, must be fatuous nonsense since theirliteral meanings did not fit the world as known to nineteenth-century science.Not so fast, said Lévi. Literal meanings are not the only game in town. Thereare also symbolic meanings, and religions in particular have an extraordinarilylong and rich history of using symbols, parables, and other indirect means ofexpression to communicate their teachings. What is more, religions have anequally long and rich history of using similar means to conceal their teachingsfrom those who are considered not yet ready for them. Jesus of Nazareth, henoted, taught the crowds who gathered around him in parables, reserving morestraightforward ways of discussing those teachings for his inner circle ofapostles. As for Dupuis and Volney, he argued, they had found the most marvelousproofs of Christianity’s relevance and mistaken them for proofs ofChristianity’s falsehood—for what does the presence of common symbolic themes indifferent faiths indicate if not the presence of common truths shared by thosefaiths?To Lévi, in other words, the teachings of Christianity were absurd only if theywere taken in a literal sense that, he believed, the founders of the faith hadnever intended them to have. The same argument, in his view, applied to everyother religion. The literal meaning was the proper spiritual food for childrenand the ignorant, who stood to benefit from a simple faith that taught basiclessons of morality. The inner meanings were reserved for those adults who hadthe intellectual and moral capacity to go beyond that simple faith withoutlosing its benefits. In ancient times, the mysteries had unveiled the hiddentruths behind the symbols and fables; Christianity, he argued, had done the samein its early days but had lost the keys to its own teachings in the lastcenturies of the Roman world, and thereafter those who preserved the heritage ofthe mysteries did so in secret, under the constant threat of exposure andextermination at the hands of the Inquisition and the mob.The heirs of the mysteries, though, were said to have something more than asymbolic interpretation of religious teachings to pass on to their initiates.Whispered rumors and frantic accusations alike claimed that they also taught andpracticed magic. Lévi rejected the notion that magic involved devil worship orsupernatural powers; he argued, in fact, that there is nothing supernatural inthe literal sense of that word—that is, above or outside of nature. He alsorejected out of hand the idea that magic could overturn natural laws. If magicis not supernatural, then, what is it? and what can it accomplish?His answer, the third theme of this book, was as simple as it was revolutionary:magic is a psychological process. The powers and potencies that mages invokeexist within their own minds, and the arduous training through which theapprentice becomes an adept is simply a process of learning how to use vividsymbols and symbolic acts energized by the will to draw on capacities ofconsciousness that most human beings never discover in themselves. The apparentabsurdity of many magical rituals is thus beside the point, because any set ofactions that has been given a symbolic meaning can be used to accomplish theredirection of the mind that makes magic work.Consider the reasons why people down through the centuries have turned to magic.Some have used magic because they are poor and want to be rich; some have usedit because they are unloved and want to find a willing partner; some have usedit because they are weak and want to defend themselves against an enemy, oravenge a wrong done to them, or call down justice against an oppressor; some,more fortunate than the others, have used it because they feel powerless in theface of destiny but suspect that this is much less true than it seems. All thesethings can be changed, starting from the individual mind. There are many reasonswhy people are poor, but quite often the habits of the poor play a large role inkeeping them mired in poverty; there are many reasons why people are unloved,and nearly always the most important factor is some detail of their personalitythat renders them unappealing to potential partners; weakness, in the same way,is tolerably often as much a matter of attitude as it is of externalcircumstances. Change the habits of thought and action that keep an undesiredcondition in place, and very often the condition will go away; embrace thehabits of thought and action that will establish a desired condition, and thatcondition is likely to appear in short order—“like magic,” as the saying goes.[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]Behind the three themes just surveyed lie two writers who had a profoundinfluence on nineteenth-century thought. Lévi mentions neither of them, but hisrehabilitation of magic would have been impossible without their paired impactson his age, and his writings make a good deal more sense if these figures arerecognized as part of the unstated background of his work.The first of these writers was an Italian jurist and historian who worked inalmost total obscurity during his lifetime but whose work burst on the Europeanscene with immense force for most of a century after his own death. GiambattistaVico (1668–1744) spent his career laboring in a minor teaching post at theUniversity of Naples and devoted his off hours to the project of a“philosophical philology”—that is, an approach to the humanities that was asprofound and as challenging as the new philosophy of nature that was just thengiving birth to modern science. His studies crystallized in a sprawling,difficult book, Principles of the New Science Concerning the Common Nature ofNations (for obvious reasons, this is normally shortened to The New Science). Itwas published in three editions of increasing complexity, in 1725, 1730, and1744, but it attracted very little attention from anyone until 1824.In that year Jules Michelet, a young professor of history in Paris, ran across abrief note on Vico in a book he was reading. He was so intrigued by thereference that he immediately set out to learn Italian so he could read Vico’swork. “From 1824 on,” Michelet later wrote, “I was seized by a frenzy caughtfrom Vico, an incredible intoxication with his great historical principle.”2[9781101992746_EPUB-3_fn2.xhtml] That frenzy would go on to have a major impacton nineteenth-century culture, because Michelet became one of the mostcelebrated and widely read historians of the age, and his enthusiasm for Vicoguaranteed a hearing for the Italian scholar’s work.Nineteenth-century writers and thinkers drew a great many things from theastonishingly rich treasury of The New Science. The current of thought that ledto Eliphas Lévi started from one of them: Vico’s redefinition of myth. Vicoargued that it was a mistake to think of human consciousness as a constantuntroubled by historical change. In particular, what Vico calls “the conceit ofscholars”—the conviction on the part of intellectuals that their kind ofknowledge must be as old as the world—tends to hide the reality that theearliest legacies of any human society reflect ways of thinking that differradically from those of later ages. Where societies in their maturity anddecadence rely on abstract concepts, societies in their infancy make use ofconcrete sensory images; where the thinkers of an old society constructtheories, those of a young society tell stories, and the stories that embody thepatterns most important to them are religious myths.This differs sharply from the Enlightenment notion that mythology, and religionas well, are simply lumber rooms of ignorant folly long overdue for disposal. ToVico—and, as already noted, to Lévi as well—mythology is simply another methodof communicating truths, but one that has become unfamiliar to modern people.Those who take the time to learn the language of myth, both men proposed, willdiscover that behind the seeming absurdity lies a forgotten world of meaningthat reflects important realities about humanity and the universe.To borrow an example Lévi himself used repeatedly, the Thebaid—the sequence ofancient Greek myths surrounding the city of Thebes, in which the career ofOedipus, the self-sacrifice of Antigone, and the war of the Seven Against Thebesare the high points—cannot be understood if it is taken as nonsense or garbledhistory, despite the profusion of prophecies, monsters, miracles, and otherapparent improbabilities with which it abounds. The vivid verbal images andriotous events of the myths communicate, to those who have ears to hear, somepart of the knowledge of the ancient world. To Vico, that knowledge dealt withthe same subjects as modern abstract thought; Lévi, on the other hand, drew fromRenaissance sources the idea that the knowledge communicated by myth dealt withsomething beyond the ordinary.It is at this point that the second of Lévi’s unnamed sources enters thepicture. Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), like Giambattista Vico, had to facethe experience of seeing his life’s work comprehensively ignored at the time ofits publication; unlike Vico, though, he lived long enough to see it rise out ofobscurity to dominate the thinking of an age. Born in what is now the Polishcity of Gdańsk and was then the German city of Danzig, Schopenhauer came of ageduring the golden age of German philosophy. Freed from the need for aprofessional career by a modest inheritance, he devoted his life first tophilosophical studies in an assortment of German universities and then to theexplication of his own distinctive philosophical vision. His doctoraldissertation, published in 1813 as On the Fourfold Root of the Principle ofSufficient Reason (Über die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichendenGrunde), provided the foundation for his project; his greatest work, The Worldas Will and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), followed in1819, and an assortment of other writings filling in various details followed atintervals thereafter. These publications attracted next to no notice, and helabored in obscurity until 1851, when his ideas finally began to attract belatedinterest from intellectuals and avant-garde cultural figures across Europe.Lévi’s debt to Schopenhauer is profound and pervasive. The title ofSchopenhauer’s most important book, for example, can also be translated as TheWorld as Will and Imagination—the German word Vorstellung includes bothmeanings—and it is thus no accident that will and imagination are the twoprimary forces in Lévi’s magic. Other such echoes can be found throughout Lévi’swork. Schopenhauer’s impact on Lévi, though, also reaches down into the realm ofspecifics, for the entire conception of magic Lévi presents can be found inembryo in one of Schopenhauer’s less famous books.This is On the Will in Nature (Über den Willen in der Natur), published in 1835.An omnivorous reader, Schopenhauer followed contemporary discussions aboutoccultism, which had retained more of a foothold in the German-speaking lands ofcentral Europe than elsewhere in the Western world. In the book just mentioned,which collects evidence from various sciences to support the central argument ofThe World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer devoted a chapter to magicand occultism, and pointed out that both the traditional lore of magic andrecent reports of apparently magical phenomena were dependent on theconcentrated will of the magician.Magic as the manifestation of the trained and focused will: this is the seedfrom which Lévi’s conception of magic unfolded. The many echoes of Schopenhauerin Lévi’s work likely also played an important role in making The Doctrine andRitual of High Magic as popular as it was, for European avant-garde culture fromthe 1850s to the First World War was saturated with ideas drawn fromSchopenhauer, and readers steeped in that milieu must have found themselves onfamiliar ground as they considered Lévi’s interpretation of magic.More generally, it was because Lévi wrote as a man of his time, interested inthe same intellectual currents that were stirring the minds of many thoughtfulpeople in the middle of the nineteenth century, that his work had such animpact. Other authors, in France and elsewhere, had written about occult topicsin the decades immediately before The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic sawprint, but their approach to magic was by and large motivated by a rejection ofthe modern thought of their time, and so had little impact. Lévi’s genius wasthat he made magic relevant to his world—and to ours.[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]It was on the basis of that solid foundation in contemporary thought that Léviproceeded to the most daring aspect of his study of magic. Like the insightsoffered by Vico and Schopenhauer, the three of Lévi’s themes already covered,while not uncontroversial, fit without too much difficulty in the worldviewcommon to Lévi’s age and to ours. The same cannot be said of the fourth and mostimportant theme of Lévi’s work: the astral light.This is Lévi’s name for a concept familiar to nearly all students ofspirituality in one form or another: a subtle medium that bridges the gapbetween one mind and another, has deep if obscure connections to the sun and thephenomenon of biological life, and can be concentrated, dispersed, and chargedwith intention by those who know its secrets. The astral light is the prana ofthe Hindu scriptures, the qi of Chinese tradition, the ruach of Jewish lore, thepneuma of the ancient gnostics, and the anima mundi of medieval and RenaissanceChristianity; the Japanese call it ki, the Arabsrū[image/9781101992746_EPUB-3_vector-1.jpg], the Yoruba emi, the Iroquoisorenda, and the !Kung hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari Desert, n/um.3[9781101992746_EPUB-3_fn3.xhtml] This list could be extended almostindefinitely; in fact, around the world and across the centuries, very nearlythe only human cultures that have no common name for this medium are thesocieties of the modern industrial West.Lévi was not the first figure to attempt to reintroduce this concept to thecollective conversation of Western society. The most famous of his predecessors,Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), called that subtle medium “animal magnetism” anddeveloped an entire system of medical therapeutics that made use of it. (A fewscraps of that system, wrenched out of their original context and carefullycleansed of their original connection to occultism, make up the current practiceof hypnotism.) Mesmer was inevitably dismissed as a quack, a fate he has sharedwith many more recent discoverers of the same principle.In speaking of the astral light and describing it as the great magical agent,the connecting link that enables magic to reach beyond the boundaries of any onemind, Lévi thus places himself squarely in the mainstream of the world’s magicaltraditions. In the nineteenth century, furthermore, he was not quite as far fromcurrent scientific thought as he has since become. The physicists of his timetheorized that all forms of energy were vibrations in a subtle substance calledthe ether, which filled the entire universe. Lévi was familiar with the theoryand suggested that the astral light might well be an ancient name for the ether,but he did not place any great importance on the identification. His goal wassimply to explain the astral light in terms that his readers would find it easyto understand.The importance of the astral light to Lévi’s teachings is that it allows apsychological interpretation of magic to explain some of the things that magicis traditionally held to be able to do. According to the traditions of folkloreand the manuals of magic alike, a magical blessing or curse can affect a personwho does not know that the powers of magic have been invoked for his help ordamnation. A purely psychological account that accepts modern notions about theabsolute dependence of mind on matter, and conceives of thought as a mere sideeffect of certain lumps of meat called human brains, cannot explain this sort ofaction at a distance.The existence of a medium that allows influences to pass from one mind toanother takes care of this difficulty. It also solves several other crucialquestions raised by any attempt to take traditional magical lore seriously inthe modern world. The predictive power of astrology, for example, can readily beexplained by a subtle medium that is influenced in complex ways by the anglesthe sun, moon, and planets make with one another in relation to an observer,while other forms of divination can be understood as different modes of sensingthe flow of influences through the astral light.Lévi argues that every thought, word, and action shapes the astral light to someextent. Under most conditions, though, these effects are short lived and havelittle impact, because they are poorly formulated and sent out into the astrallight with very little momentum. The more clearly we formulate an intention andthe more forcefully we back it up with concentration and will, on the otherhand, the more influence it will have on the astral light, and the moreeffectively it will shape the thoughts and actions of other beings. One coreaspect of the training of the magician, therefore, centers on learning how touse the imagination and will to define an intention clearly and project it outinto the astral light with as much force as possible. Another consists oflearning how not to be influenced by the intentions and imaginations of otherbeings, in order to have the freedom to act independently.There is, however, a further dimension of magical training. Under certainconditions, after appropriate training and study, the aspiring magician canenter into a deeper and more fully conscious relation with the astral light,which allows that medium and its influences to be directed at will. The processthat leads to this attainment, according to Lévi, is called the Great Work; itis the supreme secret of magic, and Lévi describes it in a galaxy of wayswithout ever stating in so many words the secret that underlies it.This reticence is not mere obscurantism. The secret of the Great Work, as Lévipoints out repeatedly, is incommunicable; like falling in love or facing death,it involves a shift in consciousness that cannot be translated meaningfully intowords. Thus it cannot be taught to anyone who is not already capable of learningit independently, and each individual who sets out to master the secret has totread the long road to adeptship alone. The secret can be expressed in symbols,though, for the benefit of those who are almost able to grasp it, and this Lévidoes repeatedly, in a galaxy of different ways.The Garden of Eden and the ancient Greek myths of the Thebaid are among thesymbolic narratives he puts to work for this purpose; the tetragrammaton, theunspeakable four-lettered name of God in Jewish lore, is another; but among thesimplest and most profound is a sequence of simple geometrical figures—a circlecontaining a cross, a six-pointed star formed of two triangles pointed inopposite directions, and a triangle—or, even more simply, the numbers four, two,and three. The circle and the number four relate to the four magical elements,fire, air, water, and earth; the star and the number two relate to the twocontending-and-cooperating forces that Chinese philosophy calls yang and yin;the triangle and the number three relates to the resolution of those two forces.Unfold the hidden logic uniting these symbols, and you have grasped the supremesecret of Lévi’s magic.[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]The mysteries of the Great Work, and more generally the magical traditions Lévisought to reintroduce to a civilization that had forgotten them, thus involvepractice as well as theory: in Lévi’s own formulation, doctrine is accompaniedby ritual. It is entirely possible to approach the book that follows as a guideto an unfamiliar way of understanding the world, with no intention of puttingthat way into practice, and Lévi clearly had that possibility in mind. No smallnumber of writers who came after him followed him along that line of approach.It is anything but an accident that H. P. Blavatsky’s Isis Unveiled and AlbertPike’s Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry, two of the most influential works of the late nineteenth-centuryoccult revival, not only cite Lévi’s writings but take his ideas about thenature of faith, the meaning of symbolism, and the psychological nature ofritual as basic presuppositions.It is equally clear from the contents of Lévi’s book, though, that he also meantit to be used by that minority of readers who were interested in exploringmagic, not merely as a theoretical possibility, but also as a practical realityin their own lives. That intention was fulfilled abundantly in the decades thatfollowed the publication of The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic. The “youngmen of letters who talked of magic” about whom Yeats reminisced were matched, inintensity and cultural impact if not in number, by men and women who not onlytalked of magic but practiced it as well. For a century after Lévi’s death, thegreat majority of practicing mages in the Western world drew extensively on hisideas; read the writings of Dion Fortune, Franz Bardon, Mouni Sadhu, JuliusEvola’s UR Group, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, just to cite someor the more widely known names, and references to Lévi and his ideas stand outon every page.The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic is thus also a magical handbook, one thatlays out a specific and entirely workable course of training that can befollowed by the aspiring mage. A word of caution is in order, however, for thosewho choose to take up the challenge Lévi offers. Until quite recently, it wasstandard for authors of magical treatises to go out of their way not to makethings too easy for their readers, and Lévi stands squarely in that tradition.His goal throughout The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic is to force hisreaders to think for themselves, to look past the obvious surface meanings ofhis words to grasp a message that is not meant for the clueless. The tools heput to work in this traditional pastime of mages, though, were those of his owntime and culture: above all, the dry wit and calculated absurdity for whichnineteenth-century French literature is deservedly famous.It is thus crucial to keep in mind that Lévi very often uses the same symbolicand allegorical way of speaking he traces out in the Bible, the Thebaid, and somany other sources. It is precisely when he seems to be saying something verystraightforward, in the most simplistic of literal senses, that his real meaningis most likely to be concealed. Nor is there only one valid meaning to everyphrase or passage. As Lévi himself points out, many magical teachings are meantto be taken in three different senses—physical, intellectual, and spiritual—andcommonly the student discovers those meanings one at a time, as work pursued onthe basis of one meaning develops the inner capacities needed to understandanother meaning.Those who are interested in practicing Lévi’s magic, and in following the way ofinitiation this book outlines, are thus advised to read the book carefully, asentence at a time; to think about ambiguities and potential double meanings;and to reread it frequently. A piece of advice found in the literature ofmedieval alchemy is worth following: “Lege, lege, lege, relege, ora, labora etinvenies” (Read, read, read, read again, pray, labor, that you may discover).The Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic, in other words, was not written for theclueless, or for those who expect the wisdom of the ages to be handed to themwithout effort. It reserves its gifts for those readers who are willing tograpple with its obscurities, delve below its surface meanings, and turn a waryeye on apparent absurdities, ambiguities, and obfuscations. It is what thealchemists of the Renaissance called a lusus serius, a “serious game” in whichthe author’s playfulness frames themes of profound importance.[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]The idea of helping to midwife a new English translation of Lévi’s Dogme etrituel de la haute magie had been on my mind for most of a decade before thisproject came together. The commonly available English rendering by Arthur EdwardWaite is profoundly unsatisfactory—pompous and turgid in style, full of errorsand significant omissions, and burdened by notes that are far too busydenouncing, dismissing, and misstating Lévi’s ideas to spare any time to helpreaders understand them. A more readable, accessible, and helpfully annotatedtranslation was needed. Other commitments put out of reach the prospect ofdrafting a translation myself, though, and there the matter rested for someyears.I am grateful to Mark Mikituk for approaching me about the possibility ofworking together on this translation and even more for tackling the projectpromptly and capably, producing a clear, readable English version in aremarkably short time. I also owe thanks to Robert Mathiesen for his graciousassistance with the Greek passages in Lévi’s text, to James Clark, Oliver C.Smith Callis, and Jean-Marc Viellevigne for their generous help with Lévi’sillustrations, and to Mitch Horowitz of TarcherPerigee for his enthusiasm forthe project. My thanks go to all."},{"pageContent":"TRANSLATOR’S NOTEMARK ANTHONY MIKITUKEliphas Lévi’s Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic is an unusual work, andtherefore, although it is unusual to do so, I would like to take a few momentsof the reader’s time to expound upon my qualifications for, and my method of,translating it.John Michael Greer and I met through the magic of the Internet: in one of hisblogs he mentioned his dissatisfaction with A. E. Waite’s translation, and I hadthe temerity to offer my services as a professional translator, in theproduction of a new, annotated version.I believe that in John Michael Greer’s mind my main qualifications for the job,aside from the fact that I am a professional translator, was that I lackedvirtually any other basis upon which to recommend myself: I belonged to nooccult organization; I had very little experience with the occult beyond anexpressed interest in it; I had not, and never did throughout this translation,read A. E. Waite’s version of the work; and, as I said to Greer myself, I had“no skin in the game.”Thus I embarked upon this translation, as the fool would, naively, with just abit of courage at hand.But no fool is entirely naive, even at birth, and from the start I chose aparticular method with regard to my translation, which was then confirmed byexperience: I believed that any great work of the occult—as The Doctrine andRitual of High Magic most certainly is—might have some ulterior, initiallyindefinable, motive, and that I should stick as closely as I possibly could tothe original form of the work, in order not to make the mistake of failing totransmit some unknown quantity.That intuition was quickly, and positively confirmed, by the effect thetranslation of Levi’s work had upon me. This was not some vulgar book, on magicor otherwise; it was written with the intention to act upon the reader’s mindexactly like an initiatory experience, if that reader is of the right frame ofmind. That is to say, although written as prose, this book is in fact poetry forthe mind and acts as a key that can be used to open it.In practice, as is the case when one translates poetry, this meant keeping asclose as possible, not only to the sense, but also to the sound, the form andthe rhythm, of the work. And so I have endeavored to keep the structure andrhythm of Lévi’s work intact. As much as possible, I have stayed close to Lévi’swords and tone, even if, perhaps, in English they at times seem a bithighfalutin. This is originally a French work, after all.Thus to the best of my ability I have attempted to intuit and reproduce TheDoctrine and Ritual of High Magic, as Éliphas Lévi might have written it, had hedone so in English.Any errors are of course mine, but I would like to thank John Michael Greer fornumerous pieces of advice and wisdom, and my wife, Géraldine, for her patience."},{"pageContent":"PART ONETHE DOCTRINE OF HIGH MAGIC[image/Doctrine_Magic_01.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE DOCTRINE OF HIGH MAGICBeyond the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories of the ancientdoctrines, beyond the shadows and strange trials of all initiations, under theseal of all sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or of Thebes,4[9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml] on the eroded stones of the ancient temples andupon the darkened sides of the sphinxes of Assyria or of Egypt, in the marvelousor monstrous paintings which express the sacred pages of the Vedas for Indianbelievers, in the strange symbols in our books on alchemy, in the initiatoryceremonies practiced by all mystery cults, we find the traces of a doctrinewhich is the same everywhere and everywhere is carefully hidden. Occultphilosophy seems to have been the wet nurse or the godmother for all religions,the secret lever of all intellectual powers, the key to all divine enigmas, andthe absolute queen of society in the eras in which it was reserved exclusivelyfor the education of priests and kings.She reigned in Persia among the mages, who one day perished, as do perish themasters of the world, for having abused their power; she endowed India with themost amazing traditions and an incredible poetic treasure, with grace and terrorin its symbols; she civilized Greece with the sounds of Orpheus’s lyre;5[9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn2.xhtml] she hid the principles of all the sciences andof all the progress of the human spirit in the audacious calculations ofPythagoras;6 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn3.xhtml] myths were full of her miracles,and history, when it attempted to consider this unknown power, fused withmythology; she shook or strengthened empires through her oracles, made tyrantsturn pale upon their thrones, and dominated minds through curiosity or fear. Forthis science, said the masses, nothing is impossible: she commands the elements,knows the language of the celestial bodies, and directs the progress of thestars; the dead rise in their tombs and articulate with fatal words the wind ofthe night that whistles in their skulls. Mistress of love or hate, the occultscience can, according to its desires, produce paradise or hell in the humanheart; she disposes at her leisure of all forms and allots as she so desireseither beauty or ugliness; she changes in turns, with the magical wand ofCirce,7 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn4.xhtml] men into brutes and animals into men;she even has at her command both life and death, and can confer riches upon heradepts through the transmutation of metals, and immortality through herquintessence and through her elixir, which is composed of gold and of light!That is what magic was from Zoroaster8 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn5.xhtml] toManes,9 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn6.xhtml] from Orpheus to Apollonius of Tyana,10[9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn7.xhtml] until positivist Christianity, triumphing atlast with the pleasant reveries and the elephantine aspirations of the school ofAlexandria, dared to publicly strike down that philosophy to which it wasanathema and thus reduced it to being even more occult and mysterious than ever.Thus it was that strange and alarming rumors were heard at the expense ofinitiates and adepts; these men were surrounded everywhere by a fatal influence:they killed or made insane those who allowed themselves to be carried away bytheir sickly sweet eloquence or the prestige of their knowledge. The women whomthey loved became stryges,11 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn8.xhtml] their childrendisappeared into their nocturnal conventicles, and people spoke in low andtrembling voices of bloody orgies and abominable feasts. They found bones in thebasements of the ancient temples, they heard screams during the night; theharvests began to wither and flocks began to languish where the magician hadpassed by. Sicknesses which defied the medical arts now sometimes made theirappearance in the world, as it has always been, they told us, due to thevenomous gaze of the adepts. At last, a universal cry of condemnation rose upagainst magic, whose name alone became a crime, and the hatred of the vulgar wasformulated in this command: “Magicians to the flames!” as was said severalcenturies previously: “Christians to the lions!”Yet the multitudes never conspire against the real powers; they do not have thescience of what is true, but only the instinct for what is strong.The particularity of the eighteenth century was to make fun of both theChristians and of magic, while at the same time becoming infatuated with thehomilies of Jean-Jacques Rousseau12 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_fn9.xhtml] and themagical illusions of Cagliostro.13 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_1.xhtml]Nonetheless, at the heart of magic there is science, just as at the heart ofChristianity there is love; and in the evangelical symbols, we see the Verb14[9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_2.xhtml] incarnate adored in his infancy by the threemages guided by a star (the ternary and the sign of the microcosm), andreceiving gold, incense, and myrrh from them: another mysterious ternary underwhose symbol is allegorically contained the highest secrets of the Cabala.Thus Christianity did not owe any hatred to magic; but human ignorance hasalways been afraid of the unknown. Occult science was obliged to hide in orderto avoid the passionate aggressions of a blind love; she covered herself withinnew hieroglyphs, concealed her efforts, disguised her hopes. Thus was createdthe jargon of alchemy, a continual deception for the vulgar transmutation ofgold and a living language only for the true disciples of Hermes.What a remarkable thing! There exist among the sacred books of the Christianstwo works which the infallible Church makes no pretension to understanding anddoes not even try to explain: the prophecy of Ezekiel and the Book ofRevelation; two Cabalistic keys doubtless reserved in heaven for the commentaryof the three wise men; books that are closed to faithful believers with sevenseals and perfectly clear to the unfaithful initiate of the occult sciences.Another book also exists; but that one, even though it is in a way popular andcan be found everywhere, is the most occult and the most unknown of all, becauseit contains the key to all the others; it is amongst the public without beingknown by the public; we do not think of finding it where it is, and we wouldlose our time multiplied by a thousand looking for it where it is not if wesuspected its existence. This book, perhaps more ancient than Enoch’s, was nevertranslated, and it is still written in primitive characters on detached pageslike the tablets of the ancients.15 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_3.xhtml] Adistinguished scholar revealed it,16 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_4.xhtml] withoutanyone remarking it; he did not quite reveal the secret itself, but itsantiquity and the singular way in which it was conserved; another scholar, butof a more fantastical than judicious spirit, spent thirty years studying thisbook and only suspected the whole of its importance. It is, in fact, amonumental and singular work, simple and powerful as the architecture of thepyramids, and in consequence as durable as them; a book which synthesizes allthe sciences, and thus all the infinite combinations that can resolve allscientific problems; a book which speaks by making us think; inspiration andregulator of all possible ideas; perhaps the masterpiece of the human spirit,and certainly the most beautiful of things left to us by antiquity; universalkey, whose name was only understood and explained by the enlightened scholarGuillaume Postel;17 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_5.xhtml] a unique text, whose firstcharacters alone sent the religious mind of Saint-Martin18[9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_6.xhtml] into an ecstasy and legitimized the unfortunateSwedenborg.19 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_7.xhtml] This book, which we shall discusslater, and its rigorous and mathematical explanation, shall be the complementand the crown to our conscientious work.The original alliance between Christianity and the science of the mages, if itis properly demonstrated for once, would not be a discovery of mediocreimportance, and we doubt not that the result of a serious study of magic and theCabala would bring serious minds to a reconciliation, until now regarded asimpossible, between science and doctrine, and between reason and faith.We have said that the Church, whose special characteristic is that of repositoryof the keys, does not pretend to have those to the Book of Revelation or thevisions of Ezekiel. For Christians, and in their opinion, the scientific andmagical keys of Solomon are lost. Nonetheless, it is certain that, in the domainof intelligence governed by the Verb, nothing which is written is lost. Thingsof which men cease to have knowledge of only stop existing for them, at least asverbs; they enter then into the domain of enigmas and mysteries.Indeed, the antipathy and even the open war of the official Church against allthat deals with the domain of magic, which is like a personal and emancipatedpriesthood, is due to causes which are necessary and even inherent to the socialand hierarchical constitution of the Christian priesthood. The Church ignoresmagic, because it must ignore it or perish, as we we shall prove later on; italso does not recognize that its mysterious founder was greeted in his crib bythe three mages, that is to say by the hieratic ambassadors from the three partsof the known world and from the three analogical worlds of occult philosophy.In the school of Alexandria, magic and Christianity almost held hands under theauspices of Ammonius Saccas and of Plato. The doctrine of Hermes is found almostin its entirety in the writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite.20[9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_8.xhtml] Synesius21 [9781101992746_EPUB-6_f_9.xhtml]draws the map from a treatise on dreams, which would be commented on later byCardano,22 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__10.xhtml] and composed into hymns which couldbe used in the liturgy of Swedenborg’s church, if that church’s visionariescould have a liturgy. It is that time of ardent abstractions and passionatesemantic disputes to which one has to connect the philosophical reign ofJulian,23 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__11.xhtml] called the Apostate, because, in hisyouth, he had grudgingly professed to the Christian faith. Everyone knows thatJulian had made the mistake of being Plutarch’s hero out of season and was, ifwe may say so, the Don Quixote of Roman knighthood; but what everyone does notknow is that Julian was a visionary and initiate of the first order; that hebelieved in the unity of God and in the universal dogma of the Trinity; that ina word, the only thing he sought from the old world was its magnificent symbolsand its highly graceful images. Julian was not a pagan, he was a gnosticenchanted by the allegories of Greek polytheism, who made the mistake of findingthe name of Jesus Christ less sonorous than that of Orpheus. The emperor in himpaid for his taste for the schools of philosophy and rhetoric; and after he hadprovided himself the spectacle of expiring like Epaminondas24[9781101992746_EPUB-6__12.xhtml] with phrases from Cato,25[9781101992746_EPUB-6__13.xhtml] he received from the public, already completelyChristian, curses for a funeral sermon and a scathing epithet as his final fame.But let us pass over the little things and the little men of the late Empire andget to the Middle Ages. Here, take this book: read the seventh page, then sitdown upon this coat which I shall lay down, and we will roll back the coveringsbefore our eyes. . . . Your head is turning, is it not, and you feel as if theearth is fleeing from beneath your feet. Hold firm and do not look. . . . Thevertigo stops; we are there.

We are in alandscape by Salvator Rosa.26 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__14.xhtml] It is a troubleddesert, which seems to be coming to rest after a storm. The Moon no longerappears in the sky; but do you not see little stars dancing in the heath? Do younot hear flying about you gigantic birds who seem in passing to be murmuringstrange words? Let us approach in silence that crossroad among the rocks. Ahusky and funereal trumpet is heard; black torches are lit from all sides. Atumultuous assembly presses about an empty chair; they look and they wait. Allof a sudden everyone prostrates themselves, and they murmur: “There he is! Therehe is! It is him!” A prince with the head of a goat arrives in leaping strides;he sits upon the throne; he turns and presents a human figurine to the assembly,while bending down, to which, then, everyone heads, with black votive candles inhand, to give it a greeting and a kiss, then the prince rises with a stridentlaugh and distributes gold, secret instructions, occult medicines, and poisonsto his acolytes. All the while fires are being lit, alder wood and ferns arebeing burnt pell-mell along with human bones and the fat from torture victims.Druidesses with golden sickles, wearing crowns of smallage and vervain,sacrifice children stolen before their baptism and prepare a horrific banquet.The tables are set: masked men sit beside half-nude women, and we begin thebacchanalian feast; nothing is missing except salt, which is the symbol ofwisdom and of immortality. The wine flows like water and leaves stainsresembling blood; the speech is obscene, and the wild caresses begin; now theentire assembly is drunk with wine, with crimes, with lust, and with song; werise in disorder, and we run to form infernal round dances. . . . Then come allthe monsters of legend, all the ghosts of nightmares; enormous toads put flutesto their lips the wrong way and blow while pressing their sides with their legs;limping beetles join the dance, crayfish play the castanets, and crocodiles playupon their scaly skins like harps; elephants and mammoths arrive dressed asCupids and raise their legs as they dance. Then the frenzied round dances breakup and disperse. . . . Each male dancer carries off a screaming, wild-hairedfemale. The lamps and candles made of human tallow go out and are left smokingin the shadows. . . . We hear cries here and there, outbreaks of laughter,blasphemies and rough breathing. . . . Come, wake up and do not make the sign ofthe cross: I have brought you back home and you are in your bed. You are a bittired, a bit broken even, from your voyage and your night; but you have seen athing of which everyone speaks without knowing of it; you are initiated into theterrible secrets like those in the cave of Trophonius:27[9781101992746_EPUB-6__15.xhtml] you have witnessed the witches’ Sabbath! Nowyou must simply avoid going insane, keep up a healthy fear for the law, and staya respectful distance from the Church and its burning stakes!Would you like to see something less fantastic, more real, and even more trulyterrible? I will have you witness the torment of Jacques de Molay and hisaccomplices, or his brothers, in martyrdom. . . .28[9781101992746_EPUB-6__16.xhtml] But do not be fooled, and do not confuse theguilty with the innocent. Did the Templars really adore Baphomet?29[9781101992746_EPUB-6__17.xhtml] Did they give a humiliating embrace to thebackside of the Goat of Mendes?30 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__18.xhtml] What, then,was this secret and powerful association that put the Church and State in peril?Judge nothing lightly, they are guilty of a great crime: they allowed theprofane a glimpse into the sanctuary of the ancient initiation; they gatheredonce again and shared amongst themselves, in order to become the masters of theworld, the fruits of the science of good and evil. The judgment which condemnsthem comes from a higher power than even the Pope’s or King Philip’s tribunal.“On the day that you eat this fruit, you shall surely die,” God himself said, aswe read in the Book of Genesis.What is happening in the world, and why do priests and kings tremble? Whatsecret power menaces the tiaras and the crowns? Here are a few madmen who runfrom country to country, and who hide, they say, the philosopher’s stone beneaththe tatters of their poverty. They can change earth into gold, yet they lackshelter and bread! Their foreheads are encircled with a halo of glory and with areflection of disgrace! One of them had found the universal science, and knewnot how to die in order to escape the tortures of his triumph: that is RaymondLully the Majorcan.31 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__19.xhtml] Another cures imaginarymaladies with fantastical remedies and formally denies the proverb which notesthe inefficiency of cauterizing a wooden leg: that is the marvelousParacelsus,32 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__20.xhtml] always as drunk and as lucid asone of Rabelais’s heroes. Here is Guillaume Postel, who naively writes to thefathers of the council of Trent because he has found the absolute doctrine,hidden since the beginning of the world, and which he hesitates to share morewidely. The council doesn’t even fret about this madman, doesn’t bother tocondemn him, and moves on to examine more serious questions about efficientgrace and sufficient grace. The one whom we see die poor and abandoned, that isCornelius Agrippa,33 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__21.xhtml] the least magician of all,and the one whom the vulgar continue to take for the most sorcerous, because hewas occasionally satirical and a hoaxer. What secret, then, have all these mencarried to their tomb? Why do we admire them without knowing them? Why do wecondemn them without a hearing? Do you ask why? And why did they becomeinitiates of these terrible occult sciences of which the Church and society areafraid? Why do they know what other men ignore? Why do they hide what everyoneis burning to know? Why are they invested with a terrible and unknown power? Theoccult sciences! Magic! Here are words which say it all and could make you thinkstill harder! De omni re scribili et quibusdam aliis.34[9781101992746_EPUB-6__22.xhtml]What is this magic, then? What was the power of these overly persecuted andproud men? Why, if they were so strong, were they not victorious over theirenemies? Why, if they were foolish and weak, did we give them the honor offearing them so much? Is there a magic, is there an occult science which is averitable power and which works wonders capable of competing with the miraclesof the authorized religions?To these two important questions we answer with a word and with a book. The bookwill be the justification of the word, and here is that word: yes, there existedand there still exists a powerful and real magic; yes, what all the legends saidabout it were true; in this case only, and contrary to what ordinarily happens,popular exaggerations were not simply off track but less than the reality.Yes, there exists a formidable secret whose revelation has already overturnedthe world, as the religious traditions of Egypt attest, symbolically summarizedby Moses, at the start of Genesis. This secret forms the fatal science of goodand evil, and its result, when it is divulged, is death. Moses symbolizes it asa tree which is at the center of the terrestrial Paradise, and which is near,which even embraces with its roots, the tree of life; the four mysterious rivershave their source at the foot of this tree, which is guarded by the sword offire and by the four forms of the biblical sphinx, Ezekiel’s Cherubim. . . .Here I must stop, I am afraid I have already said too much.Yes, there exists a unique doctrine, universal, imperishable, strong as supremereason, simple as all that is great, intelligible as all that is universally andabsolutely true, and this doctrine was the father of all others.Yes, there exists a science that confers upon man apparently superhumanprerogatives; here they are as I find them listed in a Hebrew manuscript fromthe sixteenth century:“Here now are the privileges and powers of he who holds the key of Schlomoh35[9781101992746_EPUB-6__23.xhtml] in his right hand, and in his left theblossoming almond tree branch:[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-1.jpg] Aleph.—He sees God face-to-face,without dying, and speaks casually with the seven spirits who command the entirecelestial army.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-2.jpg] Beth.—He is above all afflictions andall fears.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-3.jpg] Gimel.—He reigns with all of heavenand is served by all of hell.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-4.jpg] Daleth.—He has his health and his lifeat his command, as well as the life of others.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-5.jpg] Heh.—He can neither be surprised bymisfortune nor struck down by disasters, nor vanquished by his enemies.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-6.jpg] Vav.—He knows the reason for the past,the present, and the future.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-7.jpg] Zayin.—He has the secret of theresurrection of the dead and the key to immortality.“Those are the seven great privileges.

To know how to takepleasure even from poverty and to never fall into abjection nor misery.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-6_vector-22.jpg] Tav.—Let us add to these threeseptenaries that the wise man governs the elements, that he calms storms, thathe heals the sick by touching them, and that he raises the dead!“But there are things which Solomon sealed up with his triple seal. Theinitiates know, and that suffices. As to others, whether they laugh, or believe,or doubt, or threaten, or be fearful, what matter is it to science and to us?”Such are, in fact, the results of occult philosophy, and we are in the positionof not having to fear any accusation of folly or suspicion of charlatanism inaffirming that all these privileges are real.To demonstrate that this is so is the goal of all our work on occult philosophy.The philosopher’s stone, the universal medicine, the transmutation of metals,the squaring of the circle, and the secret of perpetual movement are neitherscientific hoaxes nor wild dreams; they are terms that must be understood intheir true sense and express all the different uses of the same secret, thedifferent characters of the same operation, that we define in a more generalmanner by simply calling it the Great Work.36 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__24.xhtml]There also exists in nature a force much more powerful than steam. With its use,a single man who could seize it and direct it, could disrupt and change the faceof the world. This force was known to the ancients: it consists of a universalagent whose supreme law is balance and whose control is directly related to thegreat arcanum of transcendental magic. Through the control of this agent, we caneven change the order of the seasons, produce daytime phenomena at night,communicate instantly from one end of the world to another, see like Apolloniuswhat is happening on the other side of the world, heal or strike at a distance,give speech a real impact and a universal effect. This agent, which just barelyrevealed itself with the fumbling of Mesmer’s disciples,37[9781101992746_EPUB-6__25.xhtml] is precisely what the adepts of the Middle Agescalled the raw material of the Great Work. The Gnostics made of it the flamingbody of the Holy Spirit, and it was that which they adored in the secret ritesof the sabbath or of the temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or ofthe androgynous goat of Mendes. All this shall be demonstrated.Such are the secrets of occult philosophy, such is how magic appears in history;let us now observe it in books and in works, in the initiations and in therites.The key to all the magical allegories is found in the folios which we haveindicated, which we believe to be the work of Hermes.38[9781101992746_EPUB-6__26.xhtml] Around this book, which we can call thekeystone of the entire edifice of the occult sciences, have gathered all numberof legends, which are either the result of a partial translation or commentarieswhich are ceaselessly renewed under a thousand different forms. Sometimes theseingenious myths group together harmoniously and form a grand saga whichcharacterizes an era without the masses being able to explain why or how. It isthus that the fabulous story of the Golden Fleece summarizes, while veilingthem, the hermetic and magical doctrines of Orpheus, and if we only go back tothe mysterious poems of Greece, it is because the sanctuaries of Egypt and Indiain some way dismay us with their wealth and leave us embarrassed for choice inthe middle of so many riches; and then we are not very far from the Thebaid,that frightening synthesis of all doctrine present, past, and future, that, soto speak, infinite myth that touches, like the divine Orpheus, the two extremesof the human life cycle.39 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__27.xhtml] What a strangething! The seven doors of Thebes, defended and attacked by the seven leaders whohave sworn upon the blood of their victims, have the same meaning as the sevenseals of the sacred book accounted for by seven spirits, and attacked by aseven-headed monster after having been opened by a living and immolated lamb inthe allegorical book of Saint John! The mysterious origin of Oedipus,40[9781101992746_EPUB-6__28.xhtml] whom we find suspended like a bloody fruit froma tree on Mount Cithaeron, recalls the symbols of Moses and the tales ofGenesis. He fights against his father and kills him without knowing him:dreadful prophecy of the blind emancipation of reason without science; and thenhe arrives before the sphinx! The sphinx, symbol of symbols, eternal enigma forthe vulgar, the granite pedestal of the science of the Sages, the devouring andsilent monster who expresses by its invariable form the unique doctrine of thegreat universal mystery. How does the quaternary become the duality, and how isit explained by the ternary? In other more illustrative and vulgar terms, whatanimal is on four feet in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?Philosophically speaking, how does the doctrine of the elemental forces producethe duality of Zoroaster, and how is it summarized by the triad of Pythagorasand Plato? What is the final reason for the allegories and the numbers, the lastword of all symbolism? Oedipus answers with a simple and terrible word whichkills the sphinx and which will have him become the perspicacious king ofThebes: the word for the enigma, is man!The poor man, he saw too much and not clearly enough, and soon he would expiatehis deadly and incomplete clairvoyance through a voluntary blinding, and then hewould disappear into the middle of a storm, like all civilizations which one daywill have guessed, without having understood, the full implications and thewhole mystery, the word for the enigma of the sphinx. All is symbolic andtranscendental in this epic saga of human destinies. The two feuding brothersexpress the second part of this great mystery, which is divinely completed bythe sacrifice of Antigone;41 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__29.xhtml] and then war, thelast war, the feuding brothers killed one by the other, Capaneus killed by thethunderbolt he had defied, Amphiaraus devoured by the earth, are all allegorieswhich by their truth and their grandeur fill with wonder those who penetrate thetriple hieratical meaning. Aeschylus42 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__30.xhtml]commented on by Ballanche43 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__31.xhtml] provides only avery weak notion of its meaning, whatever the majesty of Aeschylus’s primalpoetry and the beauty of Ballanche’s book.The secret book of ancient initiation was not ignored by Homer, who draws itsplan and its main figures on Achilles’s shield, with exacting precision.44[9781101992746_EPUB-6__32.xhtml] But Homer’s graceful fictions soon seem to makeus forget the simple and abstract truths of the primal revelation. Man takes tothe form and forgets the idea; the signs, in multiplying, lose their power;magic as well, at that time, becomes corrupt and then descends with the witchesof Thessaly into the most profane enchantments. Oedipus’s crime bore its fruitsof death, and the science of good and evil elevates evil as a sacrilegiousdivinity. Men, tired of the light, take refuge in the shadow of corporealsubstance: the dream of the void which God fills soon seems to them greater thanGod himself, and hell is created.When, in the course of this work, we will make use of these sacred words: God,Heaven, Hell, let it be known, once and for all, that we distance ourselves asfar from the meaning given these words by the profane as far as initiation isseparate from vulgar thought.45 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__33.xhtml] God, for us, isthe Azoth of the sages, the efficient and final principle of the Great Work. Weshall explain later what is obscure in these terms.Let us go back to the myth of Oedipus. The crime of the king of Thebes is not tohave understood the sphinx, it is to have destroyed the bane of Thebes withouthaving been pure enough to complete the expiation in the name of his people;soon after, a plague takes revenge for the death of the sphinx, and the king ofThebes, forced to abdicate, sacrifices himself to the terrible spirit of themonster, which is more alive and more devouring than ever, now that it haspassed from the domain of form into that of idea. Oedipus had seen what man is,and he puts out his eyes so as not to see what God is. He had divulged half ofthe great magical arcanum and, to save his people, he must carry, with himself,into exile and into the grave the other half of this terrible secret.After the colossal myth of Oedipus, we find the graceful poem of Psyche, ofwhich Apuleius is certainly not the inventor.46 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__34.xhtml]The great magical arcanum reappears here in the symbol of mystical union betweena god and a feeble mortal abandoned alone and naked on a rock. Psyche must beunaware of the secret of her ideal kingship, and if she looks at her husband,she loses him. Apuleius here comments on and interprets the allegories of Moses;but did not the Elohim of Israel and the gods of Apuleius also come from thesanctuaries of Memphis and Thebes? Psyche is the sister of Eve, or rather she isEve spiritualized. Both of them wish to know, and lose their innocence in orderto gain the honor of a trial. Both of them are worthy of descending into thehells, one to bring back Pandora’s ancient box, the other to search for andcrush the head of the ancient serpent, which is the symbol of time and of evil.Both of them commit a crime which must be expiated by the Prometheus of ancienttimes and the Lucifer of Christian legend, one is liberated, the other issubdued by Hercules and by the Savior.The great magical secret is thus Psyche’s lamp and dagger, it is Eve’s apple, itis the sacred fire revealed by Prometheus, it is Lucifer’s burning scepter, butit is also the holy cross of the Redeemer. To know this well enough in order toabuse it or divulge it, is to merit every type of torture; to know it as oneshould know it, to use it and to hide it, is to be master of the absolute.All is enclosed in one word, and in one word of four letters: it is theTetragrammaton of the Hebrews, the Azoth of the alchemists, the Thoth of theBohemians, and the Taro of the Cabalists. This word, expressed in so many ways,means God to the profane, signifies man for the philosophers, and gives adeptsthe last word of the human sciences and the key to divine power; but only healone who understands the necessity of never revealing it knows how to use it.If Oedipus, instead of killing the sphinx, had tamed it and harnessed it to hischariot in order to enter Thebes, he would have been a king free of incest, freeof calamity, and free of exile. If Psyche, by dint of submissions and caresses,had gotten Love to reveal himself, she would never have lost him. Love is one ofthe mythological images of the great secret and the great agent, because heexpresses both an action and a passion, a void and a plenitude, an arrow and awound. Initiates should understand me, and, due to the profane, one cannot speaktoo much about it.After Apuleius’s marvelous Golden Ass,47 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__35.xhtml] wefind no more magical sagas. Science, vanquished in Alexandria by the fanaticismof Hypatia’s murderers,48 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__36.xhtml] is Christianized, orrather hides under Christian veils with Ammonius, Synesius, and Dionysius theAreopagite, an author’s pseudonym. One had, in those times, to make up formiracles by having them appear to be superstition, and make up for occultscience by having it written in an unintelligible language. They resuscitatedhieroglyphic writing, and they invented pentacles and characters whichsummarized an entire doctrine in a sign, a whole series of tendencies andrevelations in a word. What was the goal of aspirants to the science? They weresearching for the secret of the Great Work, or the philosopher’s stone, orperpetual movement, or the universal medicine, expressions which often savedthem from persecution and hatred by having themselves labeled as madmen andwhich all express one of the aspects of the great magical secret, as we shalldemonstrate later. This absence of sagas lasted until the Roman de la rose,49[9781101992746_EPUB-6__37.xhtml] but the symbol of the rose, which alsoexpresses the sense of mystery and magic in the poem by Dante, is borrowed fromthe high Cabala, and it is time for us to tackle this immense and hidden sourceof the universal philosophy.The Bible, with all the allegories which enclose it, expresses only in anincomplete manner the veiled religious science of the Hebrews. The book of whichwe spoke of, and for which we will explain its hieratic characters, the bookwhich Guillaume Postel called the Genesis of Enoch, which certainly existedbefore Moses and the prophets, and whose doctrine is identical in substance withthat of the ancient Egyptians, also had its exotericism and its veils. WhenMoses spoke to the people, says the sacred book allegorically, he wore a veilover his face, and he removed that veil to speak to God: that is the cause ofthose so-called absurdities in the Bible, which allowed Voltaire to exercise hissatirical wit so often. The books were only written to recall tradition, andthey were written in symbols which are unintelligible to the profane. ThePentateuch and the poems of the prophets for that matter were just elementarybooks, of doctrine or of morals or of liturgy: the true secret and traditionalphilosophy was only written later, under even less transparent veils. And it wasthus that was born a second unknown bible, or rather, misunderstood byChristians, a collection, they say, of monstrous absurdities (and herebelievers, confused by the same ignorance, speak like skeptics); a monument, wesay, which assembles all of which the philosophical genius and the religiousgenius have ever been able to do or to make which is sublime, a treasuresurrounded by thorns, a hidden diamond in a rough and obscure stone: our readerswill have already guessed that we wish to speak of the Talmud.What a strange destiny the Jews have! The scapegoats, the martyrs, and thesaviors of the world! A long-lasting family, a courageous and hardy race, whosepersecutions always left them intact, because they had not yet accomplishedtheir mission! Do not our apostolic traditions say that after the decline infaith of the Gentiles, salvation must come again from the house of Jacob, andthat then the crucified Jew who was adored by the Christians will hand back theempire of the world into the hands of God his Father?We are seized with admiration when we penetrate the sanctuary of the Cabala, bythe sight of a doctrine so logical, so simple, and at the same time so absolute.The necessary union of ideas and of signs; the consecration of the mostfundamental realities with primitive characters, the trinity of words, ofletters and of numbers; a philosophy as simple as the alphabet, profound andinfinite as the Verb; theorems more complete and illuminating than those ofPythagoras; a theology which we summarize by counting on our fingers; aninfinity that could be held in the hollow of a child’s hand; ten numbers andtwenty-two letters, a triangle, a square, and a circle: those are the whole ofthe elements of the Cabala. They are the elementary principles of the writtenVerb, the reflection of that spoken Verb which created the world!All the truly dogmatic religions came out of the Cabala and return there; allthat is scientific and grand in the religious dreams of all the enlightened,Jacob Boehme,50 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__38.xhtml] Swedenborg, Saint-Martin, etc.,are borrowed from the Cabala; all the Masonic brotherhoods owe to it theirsecrets and their symbols. The Cabala alone devotes itself to the alliance ofuniversal reason and the divine Verb; it establishes, through the counterweightof two apparently opposing forces, the eternal balance of being; it alonereconciles reason with faith, power with liberty, science with mystery: it hasthe keys to the present, the past and the future!To become initiated into the Cabala, it does not suffice to read and meditate onthe writings of Reuchlin, Galatinus, Kircher, or Pico della Mirandola;51[9781101992746_EPUB-6__39.xhtml] one must also study and understand the Hebrewwriters in Pistorius’s collection, the Sepher Yetzirah most of all, then thephilosophy of love by Leo the Hebrew. One must also approach the great bookZohar, read carefully, in the 1684 collection entitled Cabala Denudata,52[9781101992746_EPUB-6__40.xhtml] the treatise on the pneumatic Cabala and thetreaty on the revolution of souls; then boldly and courageously enter into theenlightening darkness of the entire dogmatic and allegorical main body of theTalmud. And then we could understand Guillaume Postel and admit in a low voicethat apart from his premature dreams and overly generous emancipation of woman,the famous and knowledgeable visionary might not be as crazy as he is called bypeople who have not read him.We have just rapidly sketched out the history of occult philosophy, we havepointed out the sources and analyzed in but a few words the principal books.This work does not deal only with science; magic, or rather magical power, iscomposed of two things: a science and a force. Without force, science isnothing, or rather is in danger. To take science only by force; such is thesupreme law of the initiations. And the great revealer has said: “The kingdom ofheaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.” The door of truthis closed like the sanctuary of a virgin; one must be a man to enter. All themiracles are promised to faith; but what is faith if not the audacity of a willwhich does not hesitate in the darkness, and which walks towards the lightthrough all trials and by overcoming all obstacles!We do not have to repeat here the story of the ancient initiations; the moredangerous and terrible they were, the more effective they were: and the world,then, had men to govern and instruct it. The priestly art and the royal artconsisted mostly of trials of courage, trials of discretion, and trials of will.It was a novitiate which was similar to those unpopular priests of today knownunder the name of Jesuits, who would still be governing the world if they hadbeen truly wise and intelligent.After having spent our life in search of the absolute in religion, in science,and in justice; after having turned around the circle of Faust,53[9781101992746_EPUB-6__41.xhtml] we have arrived at the first doctrine and thefirst book of humanity. Here we stop, here we have found the secret of humanomnipotence and indefinite progress, the key to all symbolism, the first andlast of all the doctrines. And we have understood what this term so oftenrepeated in the Gospels means: the kingdom of God.To give a fixed point in support of human activity is to resolve Archimedes’sproblem by understanding the use of his famous lever.54[9781101992746_EPUB-6__42.xhtml] That is what the great initiators who shook theworld did, and they could not have done so except by means of the great andincommunicable secret. As a guarantee, incidentally, of its new youth, thesymbolic phoenix never appears to the world without having solemnly consumed theremains and the proof of its previous life. That is why Moses kills all those inthe desert who could have had knowledge of Egypt and its mysteries; that is whySaint Paul, in Ephesus, burns all the books which deal with the occult sciences;that is why, finally, the French Revolution, daughter of the Johannite GrandOrient55 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__43.xhtml] and of the ashes of the Templars,despoils the churches and curses the allegories of the divine cult. But all thedoctrines and all the renaissances outlaw magic and throw the mysteries into thefire or into oblivion. This is because any cult or any philosophy which comesinto the world is the offspring of humanity, which cannot live without killingits mother; this is because the symbolic serpent always turns around and devoursits tail; this is because there must be as raison d’être for any plenitude avoid, for any magnitude a space, for any affirmation a negation; it is theeternal realization of the allegory of the phoenix.Two illustrious scholars have already preceded me along the road I walk, butthey passed by, in a manner of speaking, during the night and without light. Ispeak of Volney56 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__44.xhtml] and of Dupuis,57[9781101992746_EPUB-6__45.xhtml] of Dupuis most of all, whose immense eruditiononly managed to produce one negative work. He saw only astronomy as the originof all cults, thus taking the symbolic Cycle for the dogma, and the calendar forlegend. He only lacked one single body of knowledge, that of true magic, whichencloses the secrets of the Cabala. Dupuis passed through the ancientsanctuaries like the prophet Ezekiel in the valley full of bones,58[9781101992746_EPUB-6__46.xhtml] and he understood only death, for lack ofknowing the word which gathers together the virtue of the four winds of heaven,and which could turn that immense ossuary into a living people by crying out tothe ancient symbols: “Rise up! Take on a new form and walk!”What no one has been able to or has dared to do before us, the time has comewhen we will have the audacity to try. We wish, like Julian, to rebuild thetemple, and we do not believe that in doing so we deny a wisdom which we love,and that Julian himself would have found it worthy of adoration if the hatefuland fanatical quacks of his time had permitted him to include it in his empire.The temple for us has two columns, upon one of which Christianity wrote itsname. We thus do not wish to attack Christianity; far from it, we wish toexplain and complete it. Intelligence and will have alternatively exercisedtheir power in the world; religion and philosophy still battle in our times andmust finally end up in agreement. Christianity’s initial goal was to establish,through obedience and faith, a supernatural or religious equality between menand to immobilize intelligence with faith so as to provide a point of supportfor virtue, which had just destroyed the aristocracy of science, or ratherreplaced that aristocracy, which had already been destroyed. Philosophy, on thecontrary, worked to bring men back through liberty and reason to naturalinequality, and to substitute, by founding the reign of industry, virtue withpractical knowledge. Neither of these two actions was complete and sufficient,neither of them brought men to perfection and happiness. What we dream of today,almost without daring to hope for it, is an alliance between these two forcesregarded for so long as opposites, and this alliance we have reason to desire:for the two great powers of the human soul are no more opposed to one anotherthan the male sex is opposed to the female sex; without a doubt they aredifferent, but their apparently contrary dispositions only come from theirnatural tendency to meet and to unite.Is this then nothing less than a universal solution to all problems?Without a doubt, since we are trying to explain the philosopher’s stone,perpetual movement, the secret of the Great Work and the universal medicine, wewill be accused of madness, like the divine Paracelsus, or of charlatanism, likethe great and unfortunate Agrippa. Even though Urbain Grandier’s burning stakeis extinguished,59 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__47.xhtml] there remain the namelessproscriptions of silence or of slander. We do not seek them, but we are resignedto them. We did not look to have this work published on our own, and we believethat, if the time has come to speak, the words will come of their own, from usor from others. Thus we shall remain calm, and we shall wait.Our work is divided into two parts: in one we establish the Cabalistic andmagical doctrine in its entirety, the other is dedicated to the cult, that is tosay, ceremonial magic. One is what the ancients called a clavicule; the other iswhat country people still call a grimoire.60 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__48.xhtml]The number and the subject of the chapters, which correspond between the twoparts, are anything but arbitrary and are all found indicated in the greatuniversal key for which we give for the first time a complete and satisfyingexplication.61 [9781101992746_EPUB-6__49.xhtml] May this work now go where itwishes and become what Providence desires of it: it is done, and we believe itto be durable, because it is as strong as all that is reasonable andconscientious.—Eliphas Lévi"},{"pageContent":"1 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-7_vector-1.jpg] ATHE INITIATEDISCIPLINA.AIN SOPH.KETHER.62 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn1.xhtml]When a certain philosopher63 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn2.xhtml] took as the basisfor a new revelation of human knowledge the following reasoning: “I think,therefore I am,” he changed in a way, and without his realizing it, the ancientconcept of the Supreme Being according to Christian revelation. Moses has theBeing of beings say, “I am he who is.” Descartes has man say, “I am he whothinks,” and, because thinking is to speak internally, Descartes’s man can sayjust as the God of St. John the Evangelist said: “I am he within whom and bywhom is expressed the Verb.” In principio erat verbum.64[9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn3.xhtml]What is a principle? It is a basis for speech, it is the raison d’être of theverb. The essence of the verb is in the principle: the principle is that whichis; intelligence is a principle which speaks.What is the intellectual light? It is the word. What is revelation? It is theword; being is the principle, the word is the means, and plenitude, ordevelopment and the perfection of being, is the end; to speak is to create.[image/Doctrine_Magic_02.jpg]But to say “I think, therefore I exist” is to assume the consequent of theprinciple, and recent objections raised by a great writer65[9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn4.xhtml] have sufficiently proven the philosophicalimperfection of this method. “I am, therefore something exists,” seems to us amore primal and simple basis for experimental philosophy.I am, therefore being exists.Ego sum qui sum:66 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn5.xhtml] that is God’s firstrevelation in man and of man in the world, and it is also the first axiom ofoccult philosophy.[image/25.jpg]67 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn6.xhtml]Being is being.Thus the principle behind this philosophy is what is, and there is nothinghypothetical or uncertain about it.Mercurius Trismegistus began his admirable symbol known by the name of theEmerald Tablet with this triple affirmation: “True, without error, certain, andmost true.”68 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn7.xhtml] Thus the truth is confirmed byexperience in physics, certitude is freed from any alloy of falsehood throughphilosophy, absolute truth is arrived at by analogy in the domain of religion orthe infinite, those are the primary requirements of the true science, and it isthat which magic alone can provide to its adepts.But, before anything else, who are you, you who hold this book between yourhands and are beginning to read it?On the pediment of the temple which antiquity had dedicated to the god of light,we read the following two-word inscription: Know Thyself.I have the same recommendation to give to anyone who wishes to come closer toscience.Magic, which the ancients called sanctum regnum, the holy kingdom, or thekingdom of God, regnum Dei, is only appropriate for kings and for priests: areyou priests, are you kings? The calling of magic is not a vulgar calling, andits royalty has nothing to do with the princes of this world. The kings ofscience are the priests of truth, and their reign is hidden from the multitude,as are their sacrifices and their prayers. The kings of science are those whoknow the truth, and the truth has set them free according to the formal promiseof the most powerful of initiators.69 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn8.xhtml]One who is a slave to his passions or to the prejudices of this world will notknow how to become an initiate, he will never be able to do so, as long as hedoes not reform himself; and so he will not know how to become an adept, becausethe word adept means he who succeeded by his will and through his works.One who loves his ideas and is afraid to lose them, who is suspicious of newtruths and is not disposed to doubt everything rather than accept something atrandom: he can close this book, which is useless and dangerous to him: he willunderstand it poorly and will be troubled by it, but he would be even moretroubled if by chance he were to understand it better.If you hold something dearer in this world than reason, the truth, and justice;if your will is uncertain and faltering, either for good, or for evil; if logicfrightens you, if the naked truth makes you blush; if your feelings are hurtwhen your errors are touched upon, throw this book away at once, and then act,in not reading it, as if it did not exist for you, but do not denounce it asdangerous: the secrets it reveals will only be understood by a small number, andthose who understand will not reveal them. Showing the light to birds of thenight is like hiding it from them, because it blinds them and becomes for themmore obscure than darkness. I will thus speak clearly, I will tell all, and Ihave the firm belief that only initiates, or those worthy of being initiates,will read everything and understand something.There is a true and a false science, a divine magic and a magic that isinfernal, that is to say misleading and obscure: we will reveal one and unveilthe other; we will distinguish the magician from the sorcerer and the adept fromthe charlatan.The magician disposes of a force which he knows, the sorcerer struggles to abusethat of which he is ignorant.The devil, if it can be permitted to use this reviled and vulgar word in a bookof science, surrenders himself to the magician, and the sorcerer surrendershimself to the devil.The magician is the sovereign pontiff of nature, the sorcerer is but itsdesecrator.The sorcerer is to the magician what the superstitious and the fanatic is to thetruly religious man.Before going further, let us clearly define magic.Magic is the traditional science of the secrets of nature, which comes to usfrom the mages.By using this science, the adept is invested with a sort of relative omnipotenceand can act in a superhuman manner, that is to say in a manner which is notwithin the common reach of men.It is in this manner that several famous adepts such as Hermes Trismegistus,Osiris, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, and others which it could be dangerous orinconvenient to name, were adored, or invoked after their death, as gods. It isin this manner that others, following the flux and reflux of opinion, whichmakes for the vagaries of success, became the henchmen of hell or dubiousadventurers, like the emperor Julian, Apuleius, Merlin the enchanter, and thearch-sorcerer, as the illustrious and miserable Cornelius Agrippa was called inhis time.To reach the sanctum regnum, that is to say the science and the power of themages, there are four things which are required: an intelligence enlightened bystudy, an audacity which nothing can stop, a will which nothing can break and adiscretion that nothing can corrupt or intoxicate.TO KNOW, TO DARE, TO WILL, TO BE SILENT, those are the four verbs of the magewhich are written in the four symbolic forms of the sphinx. These four verbs canbe combined together in four ways and can be explained four times through theothers.70 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_fn9.xhtml]On the first page of the book of Hermes; the adept is depicted wearing a largehat, which, if he lowers it, could hide his entire head.71[9781101992746_EPUB-7_f_1.xhtml] He holds one hand up towards the sky, which heseems to be commanding with his wand, and the other hand is on his chest; he hasbefore him the principal symbols or instruments of science, and he hides othersin an illusionist’s satchel. His body and his arms form the letter Aleph, thefirst of the alphabet, which the Hebrews borrowed from the Egyptians; but wewill be coming back to this symbol again later.The mage is actually what the Hebrew Cabalists called the microprosopus,72[9781101992746_EPUB-7_f_2.xhtml] that is to say the creator of the little world.The first magical science, and also the first of all the works of science, wasknowledge of oneself, it is that which contains all the others and which is theprinciple of the Great Work, it is the creation of oneself: this word needs tobe explained.The supreme reason being the only invariable principle, and in consequenceimperishable, since change is what we call death, intelligence, which adheresstrongly to and in a certain way relates to this principle, is thus alsoinvariable and therefore immortal. We understand that to adhere invariably toreason one must have become independent from all the forces which produce,through their fatal and necessary movement, the alternatives of life and death.To know how to suffer, abstain, and die, these are the first secrets that raiseus above pain, sensual desires, and the fear of the void. The man who looks forand finds a glorious death has faith in immortality, and all of humanitybelieves in it with him and for him, because humanity raises altars or statuesof him as a sign of immortal life.Man only becomes king of the animals by subjugating or taming them, otherwise hewill be their victim or their slave. Animals represent our passions, they arethe instinctive forces of nature.The world is a battlefield where liberty battles with the force of inertia byusing the active force. The physical laws are the millstone and you will be thegrain, if you do not know how to be the miller.You are called to be the king of the air, of water, of the earth, and of fire;but to reign over these four symbolic animals, you must conquer them and placethem in chains.He who aspires to become a sage and to know the great mystery of nature must bethe heir and the despoiler of the sphinx; he must have a human head to possessspeech, the wings of an eagle to conquer the heights, the body of a bull to plowthe depths, and the claws of a lion to make space for himself to the left andthe right, in front and behind.You who wish to be an initiate, are you as wise as Faust? Are you asimperturbable as Job? That is not so, is it? But you can become so if you wish.Have you conquered the whirlwinds of vague thoughts? Are you decisive and notcapricious? Do you only accept pleasure when you want it, and do you want itonly when you should? That is not so, is it? It has never been so, has it? Butit could be so if you wish.The sphinx does not only have the head of a man, he also has the breasts of awoman; can you resist the attractions of women? That is not so, is it? And hereyou laugh while answering, and you brag about your moral weakness to glorify thevital and material force within you. So be it, I allow you to pay homage to thedonkey of Sterne or Apuleius;73 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_f_3.xhtml] the donkey hasits merits, I will not deny that, for it was dedicated to Priapus as the goatwas to the god of Mendes. But let us leave that for what it is, and know only ifhe is your master or you are his. Only the person who is his own master cantruly possess the pleasure of love, for he has vanquished the love of pleasure.To be able to do and to abstain from doing, is to be twice able. Woman shacklesyou through your desires: be the master of your desires, and you will shacklewoman.The greatest insult to a man is to call him a coward. But what exactly is acoward?A coward is he who neglects to take care of his moral dignity in order toblindly obey his natural instincts.In the presence of danger, in fact, it is natural to be fearful and attempt toflee: why then is this shameful? Because honor requires us to prefer our duty toour attractions and our fears. What, from this point of view, is honor? It isthe universal presentiment of immortality and esteem for the ways to achieve it.The last victory that man can have over death is to triumph over the desire forlife, not out of despair, but from the greatest hope that is contained in thefaith, in all that is beautiful and honest, by the consent of the entire world.To learn to overcome yourself is thus to learn to live, and the austerities ofStoicism were not just a vain display of freedom!To give in to the forces of nature is to follow ordinary communal life, it is tobe the slave to second causes.To resist nature and overcome it is to create a personal and imperishable life,it is to gain freedom from the vicissitudes of life and of death.Any man who is prepared to die rather than deny truth and justice is trulyalive, because in his soul he is immortal.The goal of all ancient initiations was to find or to shape such men.Pythagoras trained his disciples through silence and all kinds of abstinence; inEgypt, initiates were trained in the four elements; in India, we know whatprodigious austerities the fakirs and brahmins were condemned to do, to reachthe kingdom of free will and divine independence.All of this ascetic scourging is borrowed from the initiation rites of theancient mysteries, and they stopped because potential initiates could no longerfind initiators; the directors of consciences have with time become as ignorantas the common man, the blind tired of following the blind, and nobody wanted tosubmit to trials which lead only to doubt and despair: the path of the light hadbeen lost.To do something, one must know what one wants to do, or at least have faith insomeone who knows. But how can I risk my life on some adventure and followsomeone who does not know himself where he is going?One should not head recklessly onto the road of the high sciences, but once enroute, one must succeed or perish. To doubt is to become insane; to stop is tofall; to retreat is to plunge into an abyss.You who have begun reading this book, if you understand it and if you wish toread it to the end, it will make of you a monarch or a madman. Make of thisvolume what you will, you will not be able to scorn it nor forget it. If you arepure, this book will be a light for you; if you are strong, it will be yourweapon; if you are holy, it will be your religion; if you are wise, it willbalance your wisdom.But if you are wicked, this book will be like an infernal torch for you, it willdig into your breast, tearing into it like a dagger; it will remain in yourmemory like a great regret; it will fill your imagination with chimeras, and itwill drive you through folly to despair. You will want to laugh at it, and allyou will be able to do is gnash your teeth, because this book is to you like thesteel file in the fable was to the serpent who tried to bite it, and who endedup wearing down all its teeth.74 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_f_4.xhtml]Let us now start the series of initiations.I said that revelation is the verb. The verb, in fact, or the word, is the cloakof existence and the characteristic sign of life. Every form is the cloak of averb, because the founding idea of the verb is the only raison d’être of theforms. Every figure is a character, and all characters belong and return to averb. That is why the ancient sages, for whom Trismegistus was their voice, hadformulated their sole doctrine in these terms:What is above is like what is below, and what is below is like what is above.In other words, the form is proportional to the idea, the shadow is the measureof the body calculated by its relation to the luminous rays. The scabbard is asdeep as the sword is long, the denial is proportional to the contraryaffirmation, production is equal to destruction in the movement which preserveslife, and there is no point in infinite space which is not the center of acircle whose circumference extends and retracts perpetually in space.Each individuality is thus perpetually perfectible, since morality is analogousto the physical order, and since we cannot conceive of a point that could notdilate, extend, and send out rays within a philosophically infinite circle.What we can say about the soul in its entirety we can say about each faculty ofthe soul.Intelligence and man’s will are instruments whose reach and power areincalculable.But intelligence and will are assisted by a little known faculty and whose greatpower belongs exclusively to the domain of magic: I speak of imagination, whichthe Cabalists called the diaphane or the translucent.The imagination, in fact, is like the eye of the soul, and it is within it thatthe forms materialize and are conserved, it is through imagination that we cansee the reflections of the invisible world, it is the mirror of visions and theapparatus of a magical life: it is through imagination that we cure diseases,that we influence the seasons, that we prevent death, that we bring the deadback to life, because it is imagination which excites the will and which givesit power over the universal agent.Imagination determines the form of the child in the center of the mother anddetermines the destiny of men; it gives wings to contagion and commands weaponsin wartime. Are you in danger during a battle? Do you think you are invulnerablelike Achilles, are you the so-called Paracelsus? Fear attracts bullets, andcourage turns back cannonballs. We know that amputees often complain about thelimbs they no longer have. Paracelsus worked on living blood by treating theresults of a phlebotomy75 [9781101992746_EPUB-7_f_5.xhtml] with medicines; hecured headaches at a distance by working on cut hairs; through the science ofthe unity of imagination and the solidarity of all parts, he was well in advanceof all the theories and experiments done by our most famous magnetists. Somiraculous were his cures, that another name was added to his original namePhilippus Theophrastus Bombast, that of Aureolus Paracelsus, and then evenadding the epithet of divine!The imagination is the instrument of the adaptation of the Verb.Imagination applied to reason is genius.Reason and genius both account in part for the diversity of its works.There is a principle, there is a truth, there is a reason, there is an absoluteand universal philosophy.What is within the unity is considered the principle, and what returns to theunity is considered the end.One is within one, that is to say all is within all.The unity is the principle of numbers, it is also the principle of movement, andin consequence of life.All of the human body comes down to a single organ, which is the brain.All the religions come down to the unity of a single doctrine, which is theaffirmation of being and its equality with itself, which constitutes itsmathematical value.There is only one doctrine in magic, and it is this: the visible is amanifestation of the invisible, or, in other terms, the perfect Verb is in thethings which are noticeable and visible, in exact proportion to the things whichare not noticeable by our senses and are invisible to our eyes.The mage raises a hand towards the sky and lowers another towards the earth, andhe says: On high, the immensity! Down here, the immensity as well; immensityequals immensity. This is true of visible things as it is for invisible things.The first letter of the holy alphabet, Aleph[image/9781101992746_EPUB-7_vector-2.jpg], represents a man who is raising ahand towards the sky and who is lowering the other towards the earth.76[9781101992746_EPUB-7_f_6.xhtml]It is the expression of the active principle of all things, it is the creationin the heavens, which corresponds to the all-powerful Verb here below. Thisletter, all on its own, is a pentacle, that is to say a character expressinguniversal science.The letter [image/9781101992746_EPUB-7_vector-3.jpg] can replace the sacredsymbols of the macrocosm and the microcosm, it explains the masonic doubletriangle and the shining five-pointed star: because the Verb is the triangle andrevelation is the star. God, in giving man reason, gave him the word, andrevelation, multiple in its forms, but singular in its principle, is entirelywithin the universal Verb, the interpreter of absolute reason.That is what the so poorly understood word Catholicism means, which, in modernpriestly language signifies infallibility.The universal in reason is the absolute, and the absolute is infallible.If absolute reason brought all of society to irresistibly believe in the word ofa child, that child would be infallible, for God and for all of humanity.Faith is nothing but reasonable confidence in the unity of reason and in theuniversality of the Verb.To believe is to acquiesce to what we do not yet know but which reason rendersus certain that we shall know, or at least recognize, one day.Thus the so-called philosophers are absurd who say: I will not believe what I donot know.Pathetic wretches! If you knew, would you have need to believe?But can I believe anything, and without reason? Certainly not! Blind and boldbelief is superstition and folly. One must believe in causes which reason forcesus to admit the existence of after witnessing effects known and appreciated byscience.Science! A great word and a great problem!What is science?We will answer that question in the second chapter of this book."},{"pageContent":"2 [image/hebrew-67.jpg] B.THE COLUMNS OF THE TEMPLECHOKMAH.DOMUS.GNOSIS.77 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn1.xhtml]Science is the complete and absolute possession of the truth.Thus the sages from all the centuries trembled before this absolute and terribleword; they feared to usurp the first privilege of the divinity, by making use ofthe word “science,”78 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn2.xhtml] and they contentedthemselves with the word gnosis, which only expresses the idea of knowledgethrough intuition, rather than the word science and the verb to know, whichexpress awareness.What does man actually know? Nothing, but he is not permitted to ignoreanything.He knows nothing, and he is called to become acquainted with everything.Yet knowledge supposes duality. The knowing subject must have a knowable object.Duality is the generator of society and laws; it is also the number of gnosis.Duality is the unity multiplying itself to create; and it is for that reasonthat the sacred symbols have Eve arising out of Adam’s chest.Adam is the human tetragram, who is summed up in the mysterious yod, image ofthe Cabalistic phallus. Add the threefold word Eve to yod and you form the nameJehovah, the divine tetragram, which is the Cabalistic and magical word parexcellence—[image/9781101992746_EPUB-8_vector-2.jpg]—that the high priest in the temple pronounced as Jodheva.79[9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn3.xhtml]It is thus that complete unity within the fecundity of the threefold form, andwith it, the quaternary, is the key to all the numbers, to all movement and toall forms.The square, by spinning around itself, produces a circle equal to itself, andthat is the quadrature of the circle, where the circular movement of the fourequal angles rotate around a single point.80 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn4.xhtml]What is above, said Hermes, is equal to what is below: that is the duality whichserves to measure the unity; and the relation of equality between above andbelow is the creative principle, it is the ideal phallus; and the principlehaving been created, is the formal cteïs.The insertion of the vertical phallus into the horizontal cteis81[9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn5.xhtml] forms the Gnostic stauros,82[9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn6.xhtml] or the philosophical cross of the masons. Thusthe crossing of the two produces four, which when moving determines the circlewith all its degrees.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-8_vector-3.jpg] is man;[image/9781101992746_EPUB-8_vector-4.jpg] is woman;83[9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn7.xhtml] 1 is the principle; 2 is the Verb; A is theactive; B is the passive; the unity is Boaz; the duality is Jachin.84[9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn8.xhtml]In Fu Hsi’s trigrams, the unity is the yang; the duality is the yin.85[9781101992746_EPUB-8_fn9.xhtml][image/Doctrine_Magic_03.jpg]Boaz and Jachin are the names of the two symbolic columns which were in front ofthe main doorway of the Cabalistic temple of Solomon.In the Cabala, these two columns explain all the mysteries of antagonism,whether natural, political, or religious, and it explains the generativeconflict between man and woman: because, according to the law of nature, womanmust resist man, and man must seduce her or subdue her.The active principle searches for the passive principle, the full loves theempty. The mouth of the serpent attracts its tail, and, in turning on itself, itboth runs away from itself and chases itself.Man created woman, and universal creation is the spouse of the first principle.When the principal being became the creator, he raised a yod or a phallus, andto give it a place in the full uncreated light he had to dig a cteïs, or a pitof shadow, equal to the dimension determined by his creative desire andattributed to him by the ideal yod of the radiant light.That is the mysterious language of the Cabalists in the Talmud, and because ofignorance and vulgar maliciousness, it is impossible for us to explain orsimplify it more.What then is creation? It is the house of the creator Verb. What is the cteïs?It is the house of the phallus.What is the nature of the active principle? It is to spread outwards. What isthe nature of the passive principle? It is to gather and fertilize.What is man? He is the initiator, he who fractures, who plows and who sows.What is woman? She is the teacher, she who consolidates, who waters and whoharvests.Man makes war, and woman brings peace; man destroys to create, woman builds topreserve; man is the revolution, woman is the conciliation; man is the father ofCain, woman is the mother of Abel.What is wisdom? It is the conciliation and the union of the two principles, itis the gentleness of Abel directing the energy of Cain, it is man following thegentle inspirations of woman, it is debauchery conquered by legitimate marriage,it is revolutionary energy softened and tamed by the gentleness of order andpeace, it is pride subdued by love, it is science recognizing the inspirationsof faith.And so human science becomes wise, because it is modest, and submits to theinfallibility of universal reason, taught by love or by universal charity. Itcan then be called gnosis, because it at least knows what it cannot yet bragabout mastering perfectly.The unity can only be manifested in the duality; the unity itself and the ideaof unity already make two.The unity of the macrocosm is revealed by the two opposing points of the twotriangles:[image/Doctrine_Magic_04.jpg]The human unity is completed by the left and the right. Primitive man isandrogynous. All the organs of the human body come in twos, except for the nose,the tongue, the umbilicus, and the Cabalistic yod.The divinity, one in his essence, has two essential conditions as thefundamental basis for his being: necessity and liberty.The laws of supreme reason require God and regulate liberty, which isnecessarily reasonable and wise.To render light visible, God has only to imagine shadow.To make truth manifest, he made doubt possible.Shadow is a foil for light, and the possibility of error is necessary for thetemporal manifestation of the truth.If the shield of Satan did not stop Michael’s lance, the angel’s power would belost in the abyss, and this would have resulted in infinite destruction, fromthe highest to the lowest.Satan is thus as necessary to Michael as the pedestal is to a statue, andMichael is as necessary to Satan as a brake to a locomotive.In the analogical and universal dynamic, we can only lean on that which resists.The universe is balanced by two forces which maintain its equilibrium: the forcewhich attracts and the force which repels. These two forces exist in physics, inphilosophy, and in religion. They produce equilibrium in physics, criticism inphilosophy, and gradual revelation in religion. The ancients represented thismystery in the battle between Eros and Anteros,86[9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_1.xhtml] in the combat between Jacob and the angel,87[9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_2.xhtml] by the mountain of gold held in equilibrium,using the symbolic serpent of India, by the gods on one side and the demons onthe other.88 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_3.xhtml]It is symbolized by the caduceus of Hermanubis, by the cherubim of the Ark, bythe two sphinxes on Osiris’s chariot, and by the two Seraphim, the black and thewhite.Its scientific reality is demonstrated by the phenomenon of polarity and by theuniversal law of sympathies and antipathies.The unintelligent disciples of Zoroaster divided the duality without bringing itto the unity, thus separating the columns of the temple and wishing to tear Godapart. The duality in God only exists through the ternary. If you conceive ofthe absolute as two, you must immediately think of them as three in order tofind the unitary principle again.This is why the material elements which are analogous to the divine elements arethought of as four, are explained by two, and only exist in the end as three.Revelation is the duality; all verbs are twofold and suppose two.89[9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_4.xhtml]The morals which result from this revelation are founded upon antagonism, whichis the consequence of the duality. The spirit and the forms are attracted andrepelled by one another like the idea and the sign, like truth and fiction.Supreme reason requires doctrine in communicating to finite intelligences, andthe doctrine, in passing through the domain of ideas and forms, participates intwo worlds and necessarily has two meanings, which speak successively or atonce, either to the spirit or to the flesh.There are also two forces in the domain of morality: one which attacks, and theother which represses or expiates. These two forces are represented in theGenesis myths by the distinctive characters of Cain and Abel.90[9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_5.xhtml]Abel oppresses Cain with his moral superiority; Cain, to free himself,immortalizes his brother by killing him, and becomes the victim of his infamy.Cain could not allow Abel to live, and Abel’s blood no longer allows Cain tosleep.In the Gospel, the character of Cain is replaced by that of the prodigal son,whose father forgives him of everything because he returns after having greatlysuffered.91 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_6.xhtml]Within God, there is mercy and justice: he does justice to the just and givesmercy to the sinners.In the soul of the world, which is the universal agent, there is a current oflove and a current of wrath.This ambient fluid which penetrates all things; this detached ray of the Sun’sglory which is fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and by the centralattractive force, this body of the Holy Spirit that we call the universal agentand which the ancients represented with the symbol of the snake biting its tail,this electromagnetic ether, this vital and luminous calorific is symbolized inthe ancient monuments by Isis’s belt, which turns and returns in a knot of lovearound the two poles, and by the serpent biting its tail, emblem of prudence andof Saturn.Movement and life consist of the extreme tension between two forces.It would please God, said the Master, if you were entirely cold or entirelyhot!92 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_7.xhtml]Indeed, a great wrongdoer is more alive than a cowardly and apathetic man, andhis return to virtue will be due to the energy of his wanderings.The woman who must crush the head of the serpent93[9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_8.xhtml] is intelligence, which is always surmountingthe current of blind forces. She is, say the Cabalists, the virgin of the sea,whose humid feet the infernal dragon comes to lick with his tongues of fire, andthen falls asleep from delight.These are the hieratic mysteries of duality. But there is one, the last of themall, that should not be revealed: the reason for this, according to HermesTrismegistus, is due to the stupidity of the vulgar, who would add to thenecessities of science the entire immoral range of a blind destiny. One mustcontain the vulgar, he also says, by the fear of the unknown; and the Christsaid it as well: Do not cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample themunder their feet, and turn and devour you.94 [9781101992746_EPUB-8_f_9.xhtml]The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, whose fruits cause death, is thesymbol of this hieratic secret of the duality. This secret, in fact, if it isrevealed, can only be misunderstood, and would ordinarily result in the impiousnegation of free will, which is the moral principle of life. It is thus naturalthat the revelation of this secret causes death, and it is not even the greatestmystery of magic; but the secret of duality leads to that of the quaternary, or,more precisely, it proceeds from and is resolved by the ternary, which containsthe word of the enigma of the sphinx as it must have been found in order to savelife, to expiate the involuntary crime, and secure the kingship of Oedipus.In the hieroglyphic book of Hermes,95 [9781101992746_EPUB-8__10.xhtml] which isalso called the book of Thoth, the duality is represented either by a highpriestess with the horns of Isis, her head veiled, with an open book which shepartially hides under her cloak, or by the sovereign woman, the Greek goddessJuno, holding one hand raised towards the sky and the other lowered towards theearth, as if with her gesture she were formulating the unique and dualisticdoctrine which is the basis for all magic and which is the first marveloussymbol in Hermes’s Emerald Tablet.In the Revelation of Saint John, there are the two witnesses, or martyrs, towhich prophetic tradition ascribes the names of Elijah and Enoch:96[9781101992746_EPUB-8__11.xhtml] Elijah, the man of faith, of zeal and miracles;Enoch, the same whom the Egyptians called Hermes and the Phoenicians honoredunder the name of Cadmus, author of the sacred alphabet and the universal key tothe initiations of the Verb, father of the Cabala, he, say the saintlyallegories, who did not die like other men but was raised to the heavens toreturn in the end times. Much the same thing was said about Saint John himself,who rediscovered and explained in his Apocalypse the symbols of the Verb ofEnoch. This resurrection of Saint John and Enoch, awaited for at the end of thecenturies of ignorance, shall be the renewal of their doctrine through theintelligence of the Cabalistic keys which open the temple of the unity and theuniversal philosophy, which have too long remained occult and the exclusivereserve of the elect whom this world has made to die.But we have said that the reproduction of the unity by the duality inevitablyleads to the notion and doctrine of the ternary, and we arrive finally to thatgreat number, which is the fulfillment and the perfect Verb of unity."},{"pageContent":"3 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-9_vector-1.jpg] C.THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMONPLENITUDO VOCIS.BINAH.PHYSIS.97 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn1.xhtml]The perfect Verb is the ternary, because it supposes an intelligent principle,an expressive principle, and a spoken principle.The absolute, which is revealed by the word, gives this word a meaning which istrue to itself, and creates a third “itself” in the understanding of this word.It is thus that the Sun is made manifest by the light and demonstrates thismanifestation, or renders it effective, through its heat.The ternary is outlined in space from the sky’s zenith, infinite in height,which is attached by two straight and diverging lines to the orient and theoccident.But reason compares this visible triangle to another invisible triangle, whichit affirms to be equal to the first: it is the one which has as its summit thedepths and whose base is inverted and parallel to the horizontal line which goesfrom the orient to the occident.These two triangles reunited in a single figure, which is that of thesix-pointed star, forms the sacred seal of Solomon, the shining star of themacrocosm.98 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn2.xhtml]This symbol, which is the great pentacle, expresses the idea of the infinite andthe absolute, which is to say that it is the simplest and most complete synopsisof all things.On its own, grammar attributes three persons to the verb. The first person is hewho speaks, the second is he to whom we speak, the third is he about whom wespeak.The infinite prince, in creating, speaks of himself to himself.That is the explanation of the ternary and the origin of the dogma of theTrinity.The magical doctrine is also of one in three and three in one.That which is above resembles or is equal to that which is below.Thus, two things which resemble each other and the verb which expresses theirresemblance makes three.The ternary is the universal doctrine.In magic it is principle, fulfillment, and adaptation; in alchemy it is azoth,incorporation, and transmutation; in theology it is God, incarnation, andredemption; in the human soul it is thought, love, and action; in the family itis father, mother, and child. The ternary is the goal and ultimate expression oflove: we search for another to become two in order to become three.There are three intelligible worlds which correspond to each other through ahierarchical analogy: the natural or physical world, the spiritual ormetaphysical world, and the divine or religious world.From this principle results the hierarchy of states of mind divided in threeorders, which are again subdivided, as always, by the ternary.All these revelations are logical deductions from the first mathematical notionsof being and number.The unity, to become active, must multiply. An indivisible principle, which isimmobile and infertile, would be a dead and incomprehensible unity.If God was only one, he would never be creator and father. If he was two, therewould be infinite antagonism or division, and the result would be the divisionor death of all things: thus he is three in order to create from himself, and inhis image, the infinite multitude of beings and numbers.Thus he is truly unique, of himself, and threefold in our conception of him,which also makes us see him through our intellect and in our love as boththreefold and unique.This is a mystery for the believer and a logical necessity for the initiate ofthe true and absolute sciences.The Verb made manifest by life is realization or incarnation.The life of the Verb, in completing its cyclical movement, is adaptation orredemption. This threefold doctrine was known to all the sanctuaries enlightenedby the tradition of the sages. Do you wish to know which is the true religion?Look for the one which understands the most about the divine order, the onewhich humanizes God and deifies man, the one which keeps the ternary doctrineintact, the one which incarnates the Verb by having the most ignorant among ussee and touch God, and finally the one whose doctrine is suitable for all andcan be adapted by everyone; the religion which is hierarchical and cyclical,which has for its children allegories and symbols, which contains for completedmen a high philosophy, and has sublime hopes and sweet consolations for old men.The first sages who searched for the cause of causes saw good and evil in theworld; they observed shadow and light; they compared winter to spring, old ageto youth, life to death, and they said, “The first cause is beneficial andharsh, it vivifies and it destroys.”Are there, then, two contrary principles, one good and one evil? So proclaimedthe disciples of Manes.No, the two principles of the universal equilibrium are not contrary, even ifthey are opposites in appearance: because it is a single, unique wisdom whichopposes one against the other.The good is to the right, evil is to the left, but supreme grace is above thetwo, and it puts evil in service to the triumph of good, and the good inreparation for evil.The principle of harmony is in the unity, and it is why magic finds so muchpower in odd numbers.But the most perfect of odd numbers is three, because it is the trilogy of theunity.In Fu Hsi’s trigrams, the superior ternary is composed of three yangs, ormasculine figures, because in the idea of God, which is considered the principleof fertility in the three worlds, one cannot accept anything of the passive.It is for this reason also that the Christian trinity does not accept thepersonification of the mother, which is implied in the son. It is also for thisreason that it is contrary to the laws of orthodox hieratic symbolism topersonify the Holy Spirit as a woman.99 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn3.xhtml]Woman comes from man just as nature comes from God: also the Christ raiseshimself to heaven and assumes the Virgin mother; we speak of the ascension ofthe Savior and the assumption of the mother of God.God, considered as the father, has nature for a daughter.God, as the son, has the Virgin for a mother and the Church as a spouse.As the Holy Spirit, he regenerates and fertilizes humanity.It is thus, in Fu Hsi’s trigrams, that the three superior yangs correspond tothe three inferior yins, because Fu Hsi’s trigrams comprise a pentacle similarto the two triangles of Solomon but with a ternary explanation of the sixbrilliant points of the star.[image/Doctrine_Magic_05.jpg]Dogma is not divine unless it is truly human, that is to say it summarizes thehighest reason of humanity: also, the Master whom we call the Man-God calledhimself the Son of Man.Revelation is the expression of the belief in the human Verb as accepted andformulated by universal reason.That is why we say that within the Man-God, divinity is human and humanity isdivine.We write all this philosophically speaking, and not theologically, and this hasnothing to do with the Church’s teachings, which condemn and must always condemnmagic.Paracelsus and Agrippa did not raise altar against altar but submittedthemselves to the dominant religion of their times. To the elect of science, thethings of science; to the faithful, the things of faith!The Emperor Julian, in his hymn to the royal Sun,100[9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn4.xhtml] provides a theory of the ternary which isalmost exactly the same as that of the visionary Swedenborg.The Sun of the divine world is the uncreated infinite spiritual light; it is thelight which verbalizes, if we can so phrase it, in the philosophical world andbecomes the home of souls and of the truth, then it becomes corporeal andbecomes the visible light of the sun of the third world, the central sun of oursuns, of which the fixed stars are ever-living sparks.The Cabalists compare the spirit to a substance which remains fluid in thedivine milieu and under the influence of the essential light but whose exteriorhardens like wax exposed to the air of the coldest regions of reasoning or ofthe visible forms. These husks or petrified envelopes (we would express itbetter by saying “carnified,” if the word existed in French) are the cause oferrors or of evil, which are due to the weight and the hardness of theseenvelopes of the soul. In the book of Zohar and in the book of the revolutionsof souls, perverted minds, or wicked demons, are called nothing other than husksor cortices.101 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn5.xhtml]The husks of the world of the spirits are transparent, those of the materialworld are opaque; bodies are only temporary crusts from which souls must bedelivered; but those who obey the body in this life produce an interior body ora fluidic crust which becomes their prison and their torment after death, untilthey manage to melt it in the heat of the divine light, to which their weightstops them from rising; they only manage this after infinite efforts and withthe help of the just, who assist them, and during all this time they aredevoured by the internal activity of the captive spirit as if they were in araging furnace. Those who arrive at the pyre of expiation burn themselves likeHercules atop Mount Oeta and thus deliver themselves from their suffering;102[9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn6.xhtml] but most lack the courage to face this finaltest, which appears like a second and more horrible death to them than thefirst, and thus remain in hell, which is eternal by law and fact, but into whichsouls are never thrown or held against their will.The three worlds correspond to each other through the thirty-two paths of lightwhich are the rungs of the divine ladder; every true thought corresponds to adivine grace in heaven and to a helpful deed on earth. Every grace of Godarouses a truth and produces one or more acts, and reciprocally every act stirsa truth or a lie in the heavens, a grace or a punishment. When a man pronouncesthe Tetragrammaton, write the Cabalists, the nine heavens are shaken, and allthe spirits cry out to each other: “Who thus disturbs the kingdom of heaven?”And then the earth reveals to the first heaven the sins of the foolhardy personwho took the eternal one’s name in vain, and the accusing Verb is transmittedfrom circle to circle, from star to star, and from hierarchy to hierarchy.All words have three meanings, all actions a threefold result, all forms athreefold idea because the absolute corresponds from world to world with itsforms. Every resolution of human will modifies nature, interests philosophy, andis written in heaven. There are then two inevitabilities, one resulting from thewill of the Uncreated in accord with his wisdom, the other resulting from thewills of the created in accord with the necessity of second causes and theirrelationships with the first cause.Thus nothing is indifferent in life, and our most apparently simple resolutionsare often what decide an incalculable series of good or evils, especially withregard to connections between our diaphane and the great magical agent, as weshall explain elsewhere.The ternary, being the fundamental principle of the entire Cabala, or sacredtradition of our fathers, had to be the fundamental dogma of Christianity, whereit explains the apparent dualism by the intervention of a harmonious andall-powerful unity. The Christ did not write down his dogma; he only revealed itin secret to his favorite disciple, the only Cabalist, and a great Cabalistamong the apostles. Thus the Book of Revelation is the book of gnosis, or thesecret doctrine of the first Christians, a doctrine whose key is indicated by asecret verse of the Paternoster, which the Vulgate does not translate, and thatin the Greek rite (the custodian of the traditions of Saint John) only thepriests are allowed to pronounce. This entirely Cabalistic verse is found in theGreek text of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew and in several Hebrewcopies. Here it is in those two sacred languages.103[9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn7.xhtml][image/34.jpg]Ὅτι σοῦ ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, Ἀμήν.The sacred word Malkuth, placed in Kether, which is its Cabalisticcorrespondence, and the balance between Geburah and Chesed repeated in thecircles or the heavens which the gnostics call Aeons, gives with this occultverse the keystone for the entire Christian temple. The Protestants translatedit and kept it in their New Testament, without discovering its lofty andmarvelous meaning, which would have revealed to them all the mysteries of theBook of Revelation; but it is a tradition in the Church that the revelation ofthese mysteries is reserved for the end times.Malkuth, supported by Geburah and by Chesed, is the temple of Solomon, which hasJachin and Boaz for columns. It is the Adamic doctrine, supported on one side bythe resignation of Abel and on the other by the work and remorse of Cain; it isthe universal balance of reality based on necessity and on liberty, on stillnessand movement; it is the demonstration of the universal lever vainly sought afterby Archimedes. A scholar who used his talent to obscure, and who died withoutwanting to be understood, solved this supreme equation, which he found in theCabala, and who feared above all we would not understand, if he explained theorigin of his discoveries more clearly. We heard one of his disciples andadmirers angrily protest, perhaps in good faith, upon hearing him called aCabalist, and still we must say, to the glory of this scholar, that his studiesconsiderably reduced our work with regard to the occult sciences, and moreimportantly that the key to the high Cabala, indicated in the occult verse wejust cited, was learnedly applied to an absolute reform of all the sciences inthe books of Hoene Wronski.104 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn8.xhtml]The secret virtue of the Gospels is thus contained in three words, and thosethree words founded the three doctrines and three hierarchies. All of sciencerests on three principles, just like a syllogism with three terms. There arealso three distinct classes, or three original and natural ranks, among men, whoare all called to climb from the lowest to the highest rank. The Hebrews callthese series or degrees of progress of the spirit, Assiah, Yetzirah, andBriah.105 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_fn9.xhtml] The Gnostics, who were the ChristianCabalists, called them Hyle, Psyche and Gnosis;106[9781101992746_EPUB-9_f_1.xhtml] the supreme circle was called Atziluth by theHebrews and Pleroma107 [9781101992746_EPUB-9_f_2.xhtml] by the gnostics.In the Tetragrammaton, the ternary, taken at the start of the word, expressesdivine copulation, taken at the end, it expresses the feminine and maternity.Eve’s name has three letters, but primitive Adam is expressed by the singleletter Yod, such that Jehovah should be pronounced as Ieva. This brings us tothe great and supreme mystery of magic, expressed by the quaternary."},{"pageContent":"4 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-10_vector-1.jpg] D.THE TETRAGRAMMATONHESED.PORTA LIBRORUM.ELEMENTA.108 [9781101992746_EPUB-10_fn.xhtml]In nature there are two forces which produce an equilibrium, and the three arebut one law. That is the ternary summarized in the unity, and, in adding theidea of the unity to that of the ternary, we arrive at the quaternary, the firstsquare and perfect number, source of all numerical combinations and theprinciple behind all the forms.Affirmation, negation, discussion, solution, these are the four philosophicaloperations of the human spirit. Discussion reconciles negation with affirmationand renders them necessary to each other. It is thus that the philosophicalternary, produced by the antagonistic duality, is completed by the quaternary,the square base for all truth. In God, following the established dogma, thereare three persons, and these three persons are but one God. Three in oneproduces the idea of four, because the unity is necessary to account for thethree. In almost all languages, the name of God is made of four letters,109[9781101992746_EPUB-10__7.xhtml] and in Hebrew these four letters are onlythree, because there is one that is repeated twice: the one which expresses theVerb and the creation of the Verb.Two affirmations render possible or necessary two corresponding negations. Beingis signified, the void is not. The affirmation, like the Verb, produces anotheraffirmation, like the realization or incarnation of the Verb, and each of theseaffirmations correspond to the negation of its opposite.It is thus, as the Cabalists say, that the name of the demon, or of evil, iscomposed of the letters of the name of God, or of good, in reverse.This evil is the lost reflection or the imperfect mirage of the light in theshadow.But all that exists, either for the good or for evil, either in the light or inthe shadow, exists and is revealed by the quaternary.The affirmation of the unity supposes the number four, if this unity is not toreturn back into unity itself like a vicious circle. Also the ternary, as wehave already observed, is explained by the duality, it resolves itself by thequaternary, which is the squared unit of number pairs and the quadrangular baseof the cube, the unity of construction, of solidity, and of measurement.The Cabalistic Tetragrammaton, Jodheva, expresses God in humanity and humanityin God.The four astronomical cardinal points are, relative to us, the yes and the no oflight: the orient and the occident, and the yes and the no of heat: the southand the north.What is in visible nature, as we already know from the unique doctrine of theCabala, reveals what is in the domain of invisible nature, or the domain ofsecond causes, which are all proportional and analogous to manifestations of thefirst cause.This first cause is the one which is always revealed by the cross: the cross,that unity composed of two, which divide each other to form four; the cross,that key to the mysteries of India and of Egypt, the Tau of the patriarchs, thesymbol of the divine Osiris, the Stauros of the Gnostics, the keystone of thetemple, the symbol of occult masonry; the cross, that central point at thejunction of the right angles of two infinite triangles; the cross, which, in theFrench language, seems to be the first root and fundamental substantive of theverb “croire” (to believe) and the verb “croître” (to grow), thus reuniting theideas of science, of religion, and of progress.110[9781101992746_EPUB-10__8.xhtml]The great magical agent reveals itself through four types of phenomenon and wassubjected to the groping of the profane sciences under four names: heat, light,electricity, magnetism. It has also been given the names of Tetragrammaton;I.N.R.I.,111 [9781101992746_EPUB-10__9.xhtml] Azoth, ether,112[9781101992746_EPUB-10_10.xhtml] od,113 [9781101992746_EPUB-10_11.xhtml]magnetic fluid,114 [9781101992746_EPUB-10_12.xhtml] the soul of the Earth,115[9781101992746_EPUB-10_13.xhtml] serpent, Lucifer, etc.The great magical agent is the fourth emanation of the life principle, of whichthe Sun is the third form (see the initiates of the school of Alexandria and thedoctrine of Hermes Trismegistus).Thus the eye of the world (as the ancients called the Sun) is the mirage of thereflection of God, and the soul of the Earth is under the permanent gaze of theSun which the Earth perceives and keeps through impregnation.The Moon takes part in this impregnation of the Earth by sending the Earth asolar image during the night, so that Hermes was correct in saying, whenspeaking of the great agent: “The Sun is its father, the Moon is its mother.” Hethen adds: “The wind carried the great agent in its belly,”116[9781101992746_EPUB-10_14.xhtml] because the atmosphere is the recipient of, andlike a crucible for, the Sun’s rays, and through the great agent, with itscontinual outflows and currents, which are analogous to those of the Sun itself,is formed that living image of the Sun which entirely penetrates the Earth,enlivens it, fertilizes it, and determines all that is produced on its surface.This solar agent lives through two contrary forces: a force of attraction and aforce of projection, which is why Hermes says that it always goes back up andcomes back down.The force of attraction is always fixed in the center of objects, the force ofprojection is fixed on their contours or their surface.It is through this dual force that all is created and all subsists.Its movement is successive and indefinite, or rather simultaneous and perpetual,rolling and unrolling through spirals of contrary movements which never meet.To understand the movement of this terrestrial Sun, so as to be able to benefitfrom its currents and direct them, is to have accomplished the Great Work, andit is to be master of the world.Armed with such a power, you can make yourself adored, the vulgar will believeyou to be God.The absolute secret for directing the currents was possessed by a few men andcan be found again. It is the great magical arcanum: it depends on anincommunicable axiom and on an instrument which is the great and unique athanorof the Hermetics of the highest grade.The incommunicable axiom is enclosed Cabalistically within the four letters ofthe tetragrammaton in this manner:[image/Doctrine_Magic_06.jpg]in the letters of the words AZOTH and INRI, written Cabalistically, and in themonogram of Christ as it was appended to the labarum,117[9781101992746_EPUB-10__1.xhtml] and which the Cabalist Postel interprets withthe word ROTA, with which the adepts formed their taro or tarot, by repeatingthe first letter twice, to indicate the circle and have it understood that theword is inversed.All of magical science consists in the understanding of this secret. To havethis knowledge and to dare to use it is omnipotence in human affairs; to revealit to the profane is to lose it; to reveal it even to a disciple is to abdicatein favor of that disciple, who from that moment, would have the power of lifeand death over his initiator (I speak here from the magical point of view) andwill certainly kill him, out of fear of dying himself. (This has nothing to dowith acts treated as murder in criminal law, which serve as a basis and startingpoint for our laws and ignore instances of murder through bewitchment and occultinfluences.) We enter here into strange revelations, and we expect everyexpression of disbelief and the shrugging shoulders of fanatic disbelievers,because the religion of Voltaire also has its fanatics—apologies to the greatshades who must now be sulking in a pathetic manner within the vaults of thePantheon, while Catholicism, always strong due to its practices and itsprestige, praises them.The perfect word, that which is adequate for the thought it expresses, alwayscontains potentially or supposes a quaternary: the idea of those three necessaryand correlative forms, and also the image of the thing expressed with the threeterms of judgment which qualify it. When I say: Being exists, I implicitlyaffirm that nothingness does not exist.A height, a width which the the height divides geometrically in two, and a depthseparated from the height by the intersection of the width, such is the naturalquaternary composed of two lines which cross each other. There are also innature four movements produced by two forces which support each other by theirorientation in opposite directions. Yet the law which rules objects is analogousand proportional to the law which governs intellects, and the law which governsintellects is the very manifestation of the secret of God, which is to say themystery of creation.Suppose a watch with two parallel springs, with a gear which makes them move inopposing directions, so that one, in extending, contracts the other: such awatch would wind itself, and you would have discovered perpetual motion.118[9781101992746_EPUB-10__2.xhtml] This gear must work in both directions and beof great precision. Is it nowhere to be found? We do not believe so. But whensomeone will have discovered it, he will be able to understand by analogy allthe secrets of nature: progress as a direct result of resistance.The absolute movement of life is the perpetual result of two contrary tendencieswhich never oppose one another. When one of them appears to yield, it is aspring which stretches, and you can expect a reaction whose timing and characteris quite possible to predict; it is thus that during the era of the greatestChristian fervor, the reign of the Antichrist was known and predicted.But the Antichrist will prepare and determine the new occasion and thedefinitive triumph of the Man-God. This is also a rigorous and Cabalisticconclusion which is contained in the premises of the Gospels.Thus Christian prophecy contains a quadruple revelation: first, the fall of theancient world and the triumph of the Gospel under the first coming; second, thegreat apostasy and the arrival of the Antichrist; third, the fall of theAntichrist and the return of Christian ideas; fourth, the definitive triumph ofthe Gospel, or the Second Coming, designated by the name “the last judgment.”This quadruple prophecy contains, as we can see, two affirmations and twonegations, the idea of two ruins or universal deaths and two rebirths; becausefor every idea which appears on the social horizon we can assign without fear anorient and an occident, a zenith and a nadir. It is in that way that thephilosophical cross is the key to the prophecy, and we can open all the doors ofscience with Ezekiel’s pentacle, whose center is a star formed by the crossingof two crosses.[image/Doctrine_Magic_07.jpg]Is not human life also formed by those three phases or successivetransformations: birth, life, death, immortality? And notice here that theimmortality of the soul, required as the complement of the quaternary, is provenCabalistically by analogy, which is the unique doctrine of the truly universalreligion, just as it is the key to science and the inviolable law of nature.Death, in fact, can no more be an absolute end than birth a real beginning.Birth proves the preexistence of the human being, since nothing is produced fromnothing, and death proves immortality, since being cannot stop being any morethan nothingness cannot stop not being. Being and nothingness are two absolutelyirreconcilable ideas, with the difference that the idea of nothingness (atotally negative idea) comes from the idea of being itself, thus nothingnesscannot even be understood as an absolute negation, while the idea of being cannever even be compared to that of nothingness, and it is even less the case thatit can come out of nothingness. To say the world came out of nothingness is toutter a monstrous absurdity. All that is proceeds from what was; in consequence,nothing that is could ever not be. The succession of forms is produced byalternate movements: they are the phenomena of life that replace one anotherwithout destroying themselves. Everything changes, but nothing perishes. The Sundoes not die when it disappears at the horizon, the forms, even the most mobileones, are immortal and subsist always in the permanence of their raison d’être,which is the combination of the light with the powerful aggregates of moleculesof the first substance. They are also conserved in the astral fluid and can beevoked and reproduced according to the will of the sage, as we shall see when weexamine second sight and the evocation of memories in necromancy and othermagical operations.We will come back to the great magical agent in the fourth chapter of theRitual, where we will finish describing the characters of the great arcanum andthe means of seizing this formidable power.Let us say a few words here about the four elements of magic and about theelementary spirits.The magical elements are: in alchemy, salt, mercury, sulfur, and azoth;119[9781101992746_EPUB-10__3.xhtml] in the Cabala, the macroprosopus, themicroprosopus, and the two mothers;120 [9781101992746_EPUB-10__4.xhtml] inhieroglyphics, the man, the eagle, the lion, and the bull;121[9781101992746_EPUB-10__5.xhtml] in ancient physics, using the vulgar ideas andterms, air, water, earth, and fire.In magical science, we know that water is not ordinary water; that fire is notsimply fire, etc. These expressions hide a higher meaning. Modern science hasbroken down the four elements of the ancients and has found many so-calledsimple bodies. What is simple is the primitive substance properly so called;thus there is only one material element, and this element is always manifestedby the quaternary in its forms. We will thus keep the learned distinction of theelementary aspects as accepted by the ancients, and we will recognize air, fire,earth, and water as the four positive and visible elements of magic.The subtle and the thick, the rapid solvent and the slow solvent, or theinstruments of hot and cold, form in occult physics the two positive principlesand the two negative principles of the quaternary and must be drawn so:[image/Doctrine_Magic_08.jpg]Air and earth thus represent the male principle, fire and water belong to thefemale principle, since the philosophical cross of the pentacles is, as we havealready said, a primitive hieroglyph and elementary lingam of thegymnosophists.122 [9781101992746_EPUB-10__6.xhtml]These four elementary forms correspond to the following four elementary ideas:Spirit,Matter,Movement,Rest.All of science, in fact, is in the understanding of these four things, whichalchemy reduces to three,The Absolute,The Fixed,The Volatile;and which the Cabala relates to the actual idea of God, which is absolutereason, necessity and liberty, the threefold notion expressed in the occultbooks of the Hebrews.Under the names of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah for the divine world, Tiphereth,Chesed, and Geburah in the moral world; and finally Yesod, Hod, and Netzach inthe physical world, which, along with the moral world, is contained in the ideaof kingdom or Malkuth: we will explain in the tenth chapter of this book thistheogony, which is as rational as it is sublime.The created intelligences, having been called forth during emancipation bytrial, were placed from their birth between these four forces, the two positiveand two negative ones, and immediately began to affirm or deny the good, tochoose life or death. To find the fixed point, that is to say the moral centerof the cross, is the first problem given to them to solve; their first conquestmust be that of their own freedom.Thus certain of them begin by being pulled to the north, others to the south,certain to the right, others to the left, and as long as they are not free, theycannot make use of reason, nor be incarnated in anything other than animalforms. These unemancipated intelligences, slaves of the four elements, are whatthe Cabalists call the elementary demons, and they people the elements whichcorrespond to their state of servitude. Thus, sylphs, undines, gnomes, andsalamanders truly exist, certain of them wandering and seeking to becomeincarnate, others already incarnate and living on Earth. They are perverted andimperfect men.We will come back to this subject in the fifteenth chapter, which deals withenchantments and demons.It is also a tradition of occult physics, which led the ancients to admit theexistence of the four ages of the world; only they did not tell the vulgar thatthese four ages had to succeed each other, like the four seasons of the year,and be renewed like them. Thus the golden age has passed, and it is still tocome. But this has to do with the spirit of prophecy, and we will talk about itin the ninth chapter, which deals with the initiate and the seer.Let us now add the unity to the quaternary, and we will have together andseparately the ideas of divine synthesis and analysis, the god of the initiatesand the god of the profane. Here the doctrine is popularized and becomes lessabstract; the great hierophant intervenes."},{"pageContent":"5 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-11_vector-1.jpg] E.THE PENTAGRAMGEBURAH.ECCE.123 [9781101992746_EPUB-11_fn.xhtml][image/Doctrine_Magic_09.jpg]Up until now we have expounded upon the most arid and abstract aspects ofmagical doctrine; here begin the enchantments; here we can announce wonders andreveal the most hidden of things.The pentagram expresses the domination of the mind over the elements, and it isby this symbol that we enchain the demons of air, the spirits of fire, thespecters of water, and the ghosts of the earth.Armed with this symbol and properly prepared, you can see the infinite by usingthat faculty which is like the eye of your soul, and you will have the legionsof angels and columns of demons serve you.And let us first state the principles:There is no invisible world, there are only degrees of perfection in thedifferent systems.Objects and crude representations are like the temporary crust of the soul.The soul can perceive objects on its own, without the intercession of thecorporeal organs, through its own sensibility and its diaphane. It can seeeither spiritual or corporeal objects that exist in the universe.Spiritual and corporeal are words which only express the degrees of subtlety orthe density of the substance.What we call our imagination is simply the inherent property of our soul toassimilate images and the reflections contained in the living light, which isthe great magnetic agent.These images and reflections are revelations when science intervenes to revealthe object or the light to us. The man of genius differs from the dreamer andthe madman only in that his creations are analogous to the truth, whereas thoseof dreamers and madmen are lost reflections and misplaced images.Thus, for the sage, to imagine is to see, just as for the magician, to speak isto create.We can thus really and truly see demons, souls, etc., by means of theimagination; but the imagination of the adept is diaphanous, while theimagination of the vulgar is opaque; the light of truth crosses one as thoughthrough a splendid window and refracts in the other as though through a glazedmass full of dross and foreign objects.That which contributes the most to the errors of the vulgar and to extravagancesof folly are people’s depraved reflections of the imagination.But the seer knows with the certainty of science that the things he imagines aretrue, and experience always confirms his visions.We will explain in the Ritual by what means we can acquire this lucidity.It is by means of this light that static visionaries are able to communicatewith all the worlds, as happened so often to Emanuel Swedenborg, despite his notbeing perfectly lucid, since he did not discern the reflection of the rays andoften confused simple reveries with his most admirable dreams.We say dreams because the dream is the result of a natural and periodic ecstasycalled sleep. To be in ecstasy is to dream; magnetic somnambulism is areproduction, and a way, of ecstasy.Errors in somnambulism are caused by reflections from the diaphanes of peoplewho are awake, and even more so by reflections due to hypnotism.Dreams are visions produced by the refraction of rays of truth; reverie ishallucination caused by a reflection.The temptation of Saint Anthony, with his nightmares and his monsters,represents confusion between reflections and direct rays. As long as the soulfights, it remains rational; when it succumbs to this kind of invasiveintoxication, it is deranged.Untangling the direct ray and separating it from reflection, this is the work ofthe initiate.Now let us speak clearly and say that this work has always been accomplished bya few elite persons in the world; that revelation through intuition is thuspermanent, and that there is no insurmountable barrier which separates souls,because in nature there is no sudden break, nor are there absolute barriers thatseparate one psyche from others. All is transition and nuance, and if we supposeperfectibility, if not infinite, at least indefinite, of the human faculties, wewould see that any man can manage to see all, and in consequence to know all, atleast in one circle which he can indefinitely expand.There is no vacuum in nature, all is filled.There is no real death in nature, all is alive.“Do you see that star?” said Napoleon to Cardinal Fesch. “No, Sire.” “Really!Well, I see it.” And he certainly did see it.It is for this reason that we accuse great men of having been superstitious: itis that they saw what the vulgar did not see.Men of genius differ from ordinary seers by the faculty they have for makingother men sense what they see themselves and to be believed out of enthusiasmand sympathy.They are the mediums of the divine Verb.Let us now speak about how this occurs.All the forms correspond to ideas, and there is no idea which does not have itsown particular form.The primordial light, the vehicle for all ideas, is the mother of all the formsand transmits them from emanation to emanation, they are only weakened oraltered because of the density of the environments.The secondary forms are reflections which return back to the home of theemanated light.The forms of objects, being a modification of light, stay in the light wherereflections refer to them. Also, the astral light or terrestrial fluid, which wecall the great magical agent, is saturated with images or reflections of allkinds, which soul can evoke and submit to its diaphane, as the Cabalists say.These images are always present in us and are only erased by the strongerimprint of the reality of the waking world or by preoccupation with ourthoughts, which render our imagination inattentive to the mobile panorama of theastral light. When we sleep, this spectacle presents itself to us, and it isthus that we produce reveries: reveries which are incoherent and vague, unlesssome dominant will remains active during sleep and gives, unbeknownst to ourintellect, a direction to the reverie, which then transforms it into a dream.Animal magnetism is nothing but artificial sleep produced by the union, eithervoluntary or forced, of two souls, one of whom keeps vigil while the othersleeps, that is to say while one directs the other in its choice of reflectionsin order to transform reveries into dreams and know the truth through images.Thus somnambulists do not really go to the places where the hypnotist sendsthem; they evoke images in the astral light and can see nothing that does notexist in that light.The astral light has a direct effect upon the nerves, which are conductors inthe animal economy and which carry it to the brain; also, in the state ofsomnambulism we can see with our nerves without even having need for the radiantlight, since the astral fluid is a latent light, just as physics has recognizedthat there exists a latent calorific.Hypnotism with two participants is without a doubt a marvelous discovery, buthypnotism with a single participant who renders himself lucid at will and whodirects himself is the perfection of the magical art and the secret of thisgreat work is not lost: it was known and practiced by a large number ofinitiates, most of all by the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana, who left behind atheory, as we shall see in our Ritual.The secret to hypnotic lucidity and the way of magnetic phenomena is twofold:the harmony of intellects and the perfect union of wills in a direction madepossible and determined by science; this is with regard to hypnotism aspracticed with several participants. Solitary hypnotism requires preparations ofwhich we spoke in our first chapter, when we listed and showed with all theirdifficulties the qualities required to be a veritable adept.We will elucidate this important and fundamental point more and more in thechapters which follow.This empire of will over the astral light, which is the physical soul of thefour elements, is symbolized in magic by the pentagram, whose figure we placedat the head of this chapter.The elementary spirits are also brought under the power of this sign when we useit with intelligence, and we can, by placing it in a circle or on a table ofevocation, render them docile, or, as it is called in magic, bind them.Let us explain this marvel in a few words. All the created spirits communicatebetween themselves by signs, and all adhere to a certain number of truths asexpressed by certain determined forms.The perfection of the forms increases with a detachment of the spirits, andthose which are not weighed down by the chains of matter recognize with theirfirst intuition if a sign is the expression of a real power or of an imprudentwill.The intelligence of the sage thus gives validity to his pentacle, just as hisscience gives weight to his will, and the spirits understand this powerimmediately.And so, with the pentagram we can force the spirits to appear in dreams, when weare awake or asleep, by bringing their reflection before our diaphane, areflection which exists in the astral light, if their reflection ever existed,or a reflection which is analogous to their spiritual Verb, if they neverexisted on earth. This explains all visions and more important demonstrates whythe dead always appear to seers either the way they had been on earth or the waythey still are in the tomb, never as they are in an existence which escapes theperceptions of our actual organism.More than others, pregnant women are influenced by the astral light, whichparticipates in the formation of their child and which incessantly presents themwith reminiscences of the forms of which they are full. It is in this way thatthrough vague similarities very virtuous women deceive malicious observers. Theyimprint, often when they consummate their marriage, an image that affected themin dream, and it is thus that the same physiognomies are perpetuated centuryafter century.The use of the Cabalistic pentagram can thus determine the image of the child tobe born, and an initiated woman could give her son the traits of Nero orAchilles, or those of Louis XIV or of Napoleon. We will indicate how this isdone in the Ritual.The pentagram is what we call, in the Cabala, the sign of the microcosm, thesign whose strength Goëthe glorifies in a fine monologue by Faust:Ah! how all my senses trembled at the sight! I feel the youth and holy joy oflife overflowing in my nerves and in my veins. Was he a God, the being whotraced that sign which calmed my giddy soul, filled my poor heart with joy, and,in a mysterious rush, revealed the forces of nature around me? Am I a God? Allhas become so clear to me; I see in these simple lines the energy of naturerevealing itself in my soul. Now for the first time I recognize the truth in thewords of the sage: The world of the spirits is not closed! Your meaning isobtuse, your heart is dead. Rise! Bathe, O adept of science, with your breast,still enveloped in a terrestrial veil, bathe in the splendors of the breakingday! (Faust, Part One, scene 1)It was on the 24th of July of the year 1854 that the author of this book,Eliphas Lévi, conducted an experiment in evocation by pentagram in London, afterhaving prepared himself using all the ceremonies indicated in the Ritual.124[9781101992746_EPUB-11__1.xhtml] The success of that experiment, whose rationaleand details we shall provide in chapter 13 of the Doctrine and the Ceremonies inchapter 13 of the Ritual, has established a new fact of pathology that true menof science will admit without hesitation. The experiment, which has beenrepeated three times, gave truly extraordinary results; positive results withoutany hallucinatory influence. We invite unbelievers to make a conscientious andreasoned attempt before shrugging their shoulders and smiling.The figure of the pentagram, enhanced by occult science, and which served theauthor in this trial, is the one found at the start of this chapter, and whichwe cannot find as complete in either the Keys of Solomon125[9781101992746_EPUB-11__2.xhtml] or the magical calendars of Tycho Brahe andDuchenteau.126 [9781101992746_EPUB-11__3.xhtml]We need but observe that the usage of the pentagram is very dangerous for thosewho do not have a complete and perfect knowledge. The direction of the points ofthe star are not arbitrary and can change the character of the entireintervention, as we will explain in Ritual.Paracelsus, that innovator in magic who surpassed all the other initiatesthrough the success of his achievements that only he was able to do, affirmsthat all the magical figures and all the Cabalistic signs of pentagrams whichthe spirits obey can be summarized by two of them, which are the synthesis ofall the others: the sign of the macrocosm, or the seal of Solomon, which we havealready shown, and which we reproduce here,[image/Doctrine_Magic_10.jpg]and that of the microcosm, even more powerful than the first, that is to say thepentagram, of which Paracelsus gives, in his occult philosophy, a meticulousdescription.If one asks how a sign could have so much power over the spirits, we would thenask in return why the Christian world prostrated itself before the sign of thecross. A sign is nothing on its own and only has power through the doctrine bywhich it is summarized and the Verb. Yet a sign which summarizes and expressesall the occult powers of nature, a sign which has always communicated to theelementary spirits and others a power superior to their nature, naturally makesthem respect and fear it and forces them to obey, through the empire of scienceand will over ignorance and weakness.It is also through the pentagram that we measure the exact proportions of thegreat and only athanor necessary for the confection of the philosopher’s stoneand for the completion of the Great Work. The most perfect alembic which canproduce the quintessence is based on this figure, and the quintessence itself issymbolized by the sign of the pentagram."},{"pageContent":"6 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-12_vector-1.jpg] F.MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUMTIPHARETH.UNCUS.127 [9781101992746_EPUB-12_fn.xhtml]The supreme intelligence is necessarily reasonable. God, in philosophy, can onlybe a hypothesis, but it is a hypothesis decreed by common sense and humanreason. To personify absolute reason is to determine the divine ideal.Necessity, liberty, and reason, that is the great and supreme triangle of theCabalists, they name reason Kether, necessity Hokhmah, and liberty Binah, intheir first divine ternary.Destiny, will, and power, such is the magical ternary which, in human terms,corresponds to the divine triangle.Destiny is the inevitable chain of effects and causes in a given order.Will is the directive faculty of the intelligent forces which reconciles theliberty of individuals with the necessity of things.Power is the wise use of the will, which puts even destiny in service to thefulfillment of the sage’s desires.When Moses hit the rock, he did not create the source of water, he revealed itto the people, because an occult science had revealed it to him through themeans of a divining rod.It is thus with all the miracles of magic: a law exists, the vulgar are unawareof it, the initiate makes use of it.The occult laws are often diametrically opposed to common conceptions. Thus, forexample, the vulgar believe in the sympathy between similar objects and the warbetween opposites; it is the obverse law which is the true one.128[9781101992746_EPUB-12__2.xhtml]Formerly we said nature abhors the void; we should have said nature is in lovewith the void, if the void, in physics, was not the most absurd of fictions.The vulgar habitually mistakes shadows for the reality in all things. He turnshis back to the light and gazes into the obscurity which he himself projects.The forces of nature are at the disposal of he who knows how to resist them.Have you mastered yourself to the point that you never become intoxicated? Thenyou dispose of the terrible and fatal power of intoxication. If you wish tointoxicate others, give them the desire to drink, but do not drink yourself.Such a person disposes of the love of others and is master of his own. If youwish to possess, do not give of yourself.The world is magnetized by the Sun’s light, and we are magnetized by the astrallight of the world. What operates in the body of the planet is repeated in us.There are in us three analogical and hierarchical worlds, as in the whole ofnature.Man is the microcosm, or the little world, and, following the doctrine ofanalogies, all that is in the big world is repeated in the little. There arethus in us three centers of attraction and fluidic projection: the brain, theheart or the epigastrium,129 [9781101992746_EPUB-12__3.xhtml] and the genitals.Each of these organs is unique and dual, that is to say that we find the idea ofthe ternary in them. Each of these organs attracts from one side and repulsesfrom the other. It is through the means of these devices that we communicatewith the universal fluid, transmitted in us through the nervous system. It isalso these three centers which are the seat of a triple magnetic operation, aswe shall explain elsewhere.When a mage has achieved lucidity, either through the intermediary of apythoness or through his own efforts, he communicates and directs at will themagnetic vibrations in the entire mass of the astral light, whose currents hedivines with the aid of a magical wand, which is a perfected divinatory wand. Bymeans of these vibrations, he influences the nervous system of people subject tohis action, precipitates or suspends currents of life, calms or torments, healsor renders sick, kills or resuscitates. . . . But here we shall stop before thesmiles of the incredulous. Let us leave to them the easy triumph of denying whatthey do not know.We shall demonstrate later that death is always preceded by a lethargic sleepand only operates by degrees; that resurrection in certain cases is possible,that the lethargy is a real death, but uncompleted, and that many deaths areonly completed after burial. But this is not the subject matter of this chapter.We were saying, then, that a lucid will can act upon the mass of astral light,and, with the participation of other wills which it absorbs and carries away,can incite large and irresistible currents. Let us also say that the astrallight condenses or rarefies, depending on whether currents accumulate more orless in certain centers. When it lacks sufficient energy to fuel life, thesicknesses of sudden decomposition follow. Gastroenteritis, for example, hasalmost no other cause, and the bacterial columns observed or supposed byscholars could be the effect rather than the cause. Thus one must treatgastroenteritis by insufflation,130 [9781101992746_EPUB-12__4.xhtml] if, withsuch a treatment, the operator does not set out to perform an exchange with thepatient which proves to be too great for the operator.All intelligent efforts of the will are a projection of human fluid or light,and here it is important to distinguish human light from astral light and animalmagnetism from universal magnetism.In using the word fluid, we employ a common expression, and we are trying to beunderstood by that means; but we are far from accepting that latent light is afluid. Everything leads us, on the contrary, to prefer describing thisexceptional phenomenon as a system of vibrations. Whatever the case, this light,being the instrument of life, is naturally fixed in all the living centers; itattaches itself to the cores of the planets as it also does in the heart of man(and by heart we mean, in magic, the great sympathetic131[9781101992746_EPUB-12__5.xhtml]), but it identifies with the actual life of thebeing it animates, and it is through this property of sympathetic assimilationthat it is divided without confusion. Thus it is terrestrial in its relation tothe earth and exclusively human with regard to its relation to man.It is for that reason that electricity, heat, light, and magnetism produced byordinary physical means not only do not produce but tend, on the contrary, toneutralize the effects of animal magnetism. The astral light, subordinate to ablind mechanism and proceeding from given self-regulating centers, is a deadlight and operates mathematically according to the impulses given to it oraccording to its predestined laws; the human light, on the contrary, is onlyfatalistic among the ignorant who attempt things at random; for the sighted, itis subordinate to intelligence, subject to imagination, and dependent on will.This light, which is incessantly projected by our will, forms what Swedenborgcalls personal atmospheres. The body absorbs that which surrounds it andendlessly radiates by projecting miasmas and invisible molecules; it is the samewith the spirit, so that this phenomenon, called by several mystics respiration,has in reality the influence that we attribute to it, either physical or moral.It is truly contagious to breathe the same air as the sick and to find oneselfin the same circle of attraction and expansion as the wicked.When the magnetic atmosphere of two people is so balanced that the attractivequalities of one absorbs the expansion of the other, an attraction is producedthat we call sympathy; and thus imagination, in evoking all the rays or analogicreflections that it is experiencing, creates a poem of desires which carries offthe will, and if the persons are of a different sex, there is produced in them,or more often in the weakest of the two, a total intoxication due to the astrallight, which we call passion, in the precise sense of that word,132[9781101992746_EPUB-12__6.xhtml] or love.Love is one of the great instruments of magical power; but it is formallyforbidden to the mage, at least in the form of intoxication or passion. It wouldbe a great tragedy if Samson were to allow himself to be put to sleep byDelilah!133 [9781101992746_EPUB-12__7.xhtml] The Hercules of science whoexchanges his royal scepter for Omphale’s spindle will soon feel Deianira’svengeance and all that will remain for him is the pyre on Mount Oeta as escapefrom the devouring restraints of Nessus’s tunic.134[9781101992746_EPUB-12__8.xhtml] Sexual love is always an illusion, since it isthe result of an imaginary mirage. The astral light is the universal seducersymbolized by the serpent of Genesis. This subtle agent, always active, alwaysluxuriant with life blood, always embellished with seductive dreams and sweetimages; this blind force is subordinate to every will, either for good or forevil; this continually reemerging circulus of an uncontrolled life, which causesgiddiness in the imprudent; this corporeal spirit, this fiery body, thisimpalpable and always present ether; this immense seduction of nature, how canit be completely defined and how can its action be qualified? Indifferent, in away, on its own, it lends itself just as easily to good as to evil; it carriesthe light and propagates darkness; we can also call it Lucifer or Lucifuge:135[9781101992746_EPUB-12__9.xhtml] it is a serpent, but it is also an aureole; itis a fire, but one that can as easily belong to the torments of hell as to theofferings of incense promised in heaven. To take possession of it, one must,like the predestined woman, place one’s feet on its head.That which corresponds to the Cabalistic woman, in the elementary world, iswater, and that which corresponds to the serpent is fire. To tame the serpent,which means to dominate the circle of astral light, one must manage to getoutside the currents, that is to say one must isolate oneself. That is whyApollonius of Tyana covered himself entirely in a coat of fine wool upon whichhe placed his feet, and which he brought up to his head; then he rounded hisspinal column into a half circle, closed his eyes after having completed severalrites which must have consisted of magnetic passes of the hand and sacramentalwords whose goal was to fixate the imagination and determine the action of thewill. The coat of wool is often used in magic; it is the usual vehicle forwitches going to a Sabbath, which proves that the witches were not really goingto the Sabbath, but that the Sabbath had found the witches isolated in theircoats and then brought to their translucid the images related to their magicalpreoccupations, mixed with the reflections of all the acts of the same type thathad been completed before them in the world.This torrent of universal life is also symbolized in religious doctrines by theexpiatory fires of hell. It is the instrument of initiation, it is the monsterto be tamed, it is the enemy to be vanquished; it is that which sends to ourevocations and conjurations of the goetia so many larvae and ghosts; it iswithin it that are conserved all the forms whose fantastical and fortuitousassemblage people our nightmares with such abominable monsters. To allow oneselfto be carried away, rudderless, by this whirling river is to fall into an abyssof madness even more terrifying than death; to chase the shadows of this chaosand make it give us the perfect forms of our thoughts is to be a man of genius,is to create, is to have triumphed over hell!The astral light directs the animal instincts and battles against man’sintelligence, which it tends to pervert through the lavishness of itsreflections and the lies of its images, a fatal and necessary action whichcontrols and renders even more deadly the elemental spirits and souls in pain,whose disturbed wills search for sympathies in our weaknesses and tempt us lessin order to drag us to perdition than to become our friends.This book of conscious beings, which, according to Christian dogma, must becomemanifest on the last day, is nothing other than the astral light in which theimpressions of all the Verbs are conserved, that is to say of all the actionsand of all the forms. Our acts modify our magnetic respiration in such a waythat a seer can say, when approaching a person for the first time, if thatperson is innocent or guilty, and what are their virtues or their crimes. Thisfaculty, which is a part of divination, was called the discernment of spirits bythe Christian mystics of the primitive Church.People who renounce the empire of reason and who love losing their will in thepursuit of reflections of the astral light are subject to alternative bouts offuror and sadness which remind us of all the wonders of demonic possession; itis true that through the use of these reflections, impure spirits can act uponsuch souls, make them docile instruments, and even accustom them to torturingtheir own organism, in which they come to reside through obsession or throughembryonization. These Cabalistic words are explained in the Hebrew book of TheRevolution of Souls,136 [9781101992746_EPUB-12__1.xhtml] whose succinct analysiscan be found in our thirteenth chapter.It is thus extremely dangerous to play at the mysteries of magic; mostimportantly it is totally reckless to practice rites out of simple curiosity, totry things out as though to tempt the superior powers. The curious who, withoutbeing adepts, get involved in evocations or occult magnetism resemble childrenwho would play with fire beside a barrel of gunpowder: sooner or later they willbe the victims of a terrible explosion.To isolate oneself from the astral light, it does not suffice to wrap oneself inwoolen material; one must also, and most importantly, have achieved an absolutetranquility of the mind and heart; have left the domain of the passions; andhave made sure of one’s ability to keep an inflexible will while actingsincerely. One must also repeat these acts of will often, because as we will seein the introduction to the Ritual, the will is only secured through acts, justlike religions have no power or duration over time except through theirceremonies and their rites.There are intoxicating substances which, by exciting the nervous system, augmentthe power of representations, and in consequence that of astral seduction; bythe same means, but going in the opposite direction, we can terrify and troublethe spirit. These substances, having magnetic qualities of their own which arefurther magnetized by practitioners, are what we call potions or enchantedbeverages. But we will not discuss this dangerous application of magic, whichCornelius Agrippa himself calls poisonous magic. There no longer exist, it istrue, burning stakes for sorcerers, but there are still, and now more than ever,punishments meted out against wrongdoers. Let us limit ourselves then toobserving, on this occasion, the reality of this power.To command the astral light, one must also understand dual vibration and knowthe balance of forces that is called magical equilibrium, and is expressed, inthe Cabala, by the senary.This equilibrium, considered in its first cause, is the will of God; in man, itis liberty; in matter, it is mathematical equilibrium.Equilibrium produces stability over time.Liberty gives birth to the immortality of man, and the will of God puts the lawsof eternal reason to work. Equilibrium in thought is wisdom, equilibrium offorces is power. Equilibrium is strict. If one observes the law, equilibrium isthere; if we violate the law, even ever so lightly, it no longer is.It is for this reason that nothing is useless or lost. All speech and allmovement are either for or against equilibrium, for or against truth: becauseequilibrium represents truth, which is composed of the “for” and “against”reconciled, or at least balanced against each other.We explain in the introduction to Ritual how magical equilibrium must beproduced, and why it is necessary to the success of all operations.Omnipotence is the most absolute liberty. Yet absolute liberty could not existwithout perfect equilibrium. Magical equilibrium is thus one of the primaryconditions for the success of operations in science, and we must search for thesame equilibrium in occult chemistry by learning to combine opposites withouthaving one neutralize the other.It is through magical equilibrium that we can explain the great and ancientmystery of existence and the relative necessity of evil.That relative necessity provides, in black magic, the measure of the power ofdemons or impure spirits, whose fury and even apparent force is increased byvirtuous acts that are committed on earth.In the eras when the saints and angels openly produced miracles, sorcerers anddevils also did marvels and wonders.It is rivalry which often makes for success: we always lean on that whichresists."},{"pageContent":"7 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-13_vector-1.jpg] G.THE FLAMING SWORDNETZACH.GLADIUS.137 [9781101992746_EPUB-13_fn.xhtml]The septenary is the sacred number in all theogonies and in all symbols, becauseit is composed of the ternary and the quaternary.The number seven represents the power of magic in all its force; it is thespirit assisted by all the elemental powers; it is the soul served by nature, itis the sanctum regnum which is spoken of in the Keys of Solomon, and it isrepresented in the Tarot by the crowned warrior with a triangle on his armor,and standing on a cube, to which are harnessed two sphinxes, one white, theother black, who pull in contrary directions while turning their heads to lookat each other.This warrior is armed with a flaming sword, and in his other hand he holds ascepter upon which are mounted a triangle and a ball.The cube is the philosopher’s stone, the sphinxes are the two forces of thegreat agent, corresponding to Jachin and Boaz which are the two columns of thetemple; the armor is the science of divine things which renders the sageinvulnerable to human attacks; the burning sword is the symbol of victory overvice, of which there are seven, like the virtues; the ideas of these virtues andthese vices were drawn by the ancients in the form of the symbols of the sevenplanets known at that time.Thus faith, that aspiration to the infinite, that noble confidence in oneself,supported by the belief in all the virtues, faith, which in people of feeblenature can degenerate into pride, was represented by the Sun; hope, the enemy ofavarice, is represented by the Moon; charity, opposed to lust, is represented byVenus, the brilliant star of the morning and dusk; strength, superior to wrath,is represented by Mars; prudence, opposed to sloth, is represented by Mercury;temperance, opposed to gluttony, is represented by Saturn, to whom we give astone to eat in the place of his children; and finally, justice, opposed toenvy, is represented by Jupiter, vanquisher of the Titans. Those are the symbolswhich astrology borrows from the Hellenic cult. In the Cabala of the Hebrews,the Sun represents the angel of light; the Moon, the angel of aspirations anddreams; Mars, the exterminating angel; Venus, the angel of loves; Mercury, thecivilizing angel; Jupiter, the angel of power; Saturn, the angel of thesolitudes. We also name them Michael, Gabriel, Samaël, Anaël, Raphaël, Zacharieland Orifiel.These powers which dominate souls divide out human life into periods thatastrologers measure by the revolution of the corresponding planets. But one mustnot confound Cabalistic astrology with judicial astrology.138[9781101992746_EPUB-13__5.xhtml] We shall explain this distinction. Childhood isdedicated to the Sun, adolescence to the Moon, youth to Mars and Venus, virilityto Mercury, maturity to Jupiter, and old age to Saturn. All of humanity livesunder the laws of development which are analogous to those of the individual. Itis on that basis that Trithemius established his prophetic key of the sevenspirits,139 [9781101992746_EPUB-13__6.xhtml] which we shall discuss later, andit is the means through which we can, by following the analogical dimensions ofsuccessive events, predict with certainty great future events and establish inadvance, from period to period, the destinies of the peoples of the world.Saint John, the custodian of the Christ’s secret doctrine, recorded thisdoctrine in the Cabalistic Book of Revelation, which he represented as closed byseven seals. We find in it the seven spirits of ancient mythology, with the cupsand the swords of the Tarot. The hidden doctrine underneath these emblems ispure Cabala, already lost by the Pharisees in the time of the arrival of theSavior; the scenes which succeed each other in this marvelous prophetic saga areso many pentacles of which the ternary and the quaternary, the septenary and theduodenary are the keys. The hieroglyphic figures are analogous to those of thebook of Hermes or of Enoch’s Genesis, to use the uncertain title which onlyexpresses the personal opinion of the scholar Guillaume Postel.The cherub or symbolic bull which Moses placed at the door to the Edenic world,and which holds in its hand the flaming sword, is the sphinx with the body of abull and the head of a human; it is the ancient Assyrian sphinx, against whichMithras’s struggle and triumph was the hieroglyphic analysis. This armed sphinxrepresents the law of mystery which guards the door to initiations in order toward off the profane. Voltaire, who knew nothing of all this, laughed greatlywhen he saw an ox holding a sword. What would he have said if he had visited theruins of Memphis and Thebes, where he would have had as an answer to his littlesarcasms, so appreciated in France, that echo of centuries past which sleeps inthe sepulchers of Psammetichus and Ramses?140 [9781101992746_EPUB-13__7.xhtml]Moses’s cherub also represents the great magical arcanum, of which the septenaryexpresses all the elements, without, however, providing the last word. Thisverbum inenarrabile141 [9781101992746_EPUB-13__8.xhtml] of the sages of theschool of Alexandria, this word which the Hebrew Cabalists write as[image/9781101992746_EPUB-13_vector-2.jpg] and translate with[image/9781101992746_EPUB-13_vector-3.jpg],142 [9781101992746_EPUB-13__9.xhtml]thus expressing the triplicity of the secondary principle, the dualism of themeans and the unity as much of the first principle as of the end, and also thealliance of the ternary with the quaternary in a word composed of four letters,which form seven by the means of a triple and a double repetition; this word ispronounced Ararita.The virtue of the septenary is absolute in magic, because this number is thedetermining factor in all things; also, all religions have consecrated it intheir rites. The seventh year for the Jews was a jubilee;143[9781101992746_EPUB-13_10.xhtml] the seventh day is consecrated to rest andprayer; there are seven sacraments, etc.The seven colors of the prism, the seven notes of music, also correspond to theseven ancient planets, that is to say to the seven chords of the human lyre. Thespiritual heaven has never changed, and astrology has remained more invariablethan astronomy. The seven planets, in fact, are none other than hieroglyphicsymbols of the keyboard of our emotions. To make talismans of the Sun, the Moonor of Saturn, is to magnetically attach one’s will to signs which correspond tothe principal powers of the soul; to consecrate something to Venus or toMercury, is to magnetize that thing in a direct intention, for either pleasure,science, or profit. The metals, the animals, the analogous perfumes are in thismatter our assistants. The seven magical animals are, among the birds,corresponding to the divine world, the swan, the owl, the vulture, the dove, thestork, the eagle and the hoopoe; among fish, corresponding to the spiritual orscientific world, are the seal, the catfish,144 [9781101992746_EPUB-13_11.xhtml]the pike, the grayling, the mullet, the dolphin, and the squid or cuttlefish;among the quadrupeds, corresponding to the natural world; are the lion, the cat,the wolf, the goat, the monkey, the stag, and the mole. Blood, fat, liver, andbile from animals are used for enchantments; brains are combined with theperfumes of the planets,145 [9781101992746_EPUB-13_12.xhtml] and it is acceptedby the practices of the ancients that they possess magnetic virtuescorresponding to the seven planetary influences.TABLE OF PLANETARY SYMBOLS[image/41.jpg]Visit bit.ly/2lj5r0t[http://ebookassets.penguinrandomhouse.com/ebookassets/features/thedoctrineandritualofhighmagic/3.jpg]for a larger version of this chart.The talismans of the seven spirits are made either from precious stones, such ascarbuncle, crystal, diamond, emerald, agate, sapphire, and onyx; or from metals,such as gold, silver, iron, copper, fixed mercury, tin, and lead. The Cabalisticsigns of the seven spirits are: for the Sun, a serpent with the head of a lion;for the Moon, a globe cut across with two crescents; for Mars, a dragon bitingthe guard of a sword; for Venus, a lingam;146 [9781101992746_EPUB-13__1.xhtml]for Mercury, the Hermetic caduceus and the cynocephalus;147[9781101992746_EPUB-13__2.xhtml] for Jupiter, the flaming pentagram held in thetalons or the beak of an eagle; for Saturn, a limping old man or a serpentwrapped around a solar stone. We find all these signs engraved in the stones ofthe ancients, and particularly on talismans from gnostic eras, known by the nameAbraxas.148 [9781101992746_EPUB-13__3.xhtml] In Paracelsus’s collection oftalismans, Jupiter is represented by a priest in ecclesiastical vestments, andin the Tarot it is figured by a great hierophant crowned with a tiara made ofthree diadems who is holding a cross with three tiers, forming the magicaltriangle and representing both the scepter and the key to the three worlds.By uniting all that we have said about the unity the ternary and the quaternary,we have all that there remains to be said about the septenary, that great andcomplete magical unity, composed of four and of three.149[9781101992746_EPUB-13__4.xhtml]"},{"pageContent":"8 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-14_vector-1.jpg] H.REALIZATIONHOD.VIVENS.150 [9781101992746_EPUB-14_fn.xhtml]Causes are revealed by effects, and effects are proportional to the causes. Thedivine Verb, the unique word, the tetragrammaton, affirmed itself with thequaternary creation. Human fecundity demonstrates the existence of divinefecundity; the yod of the divine name is the eternal virility of the firstprinciple. Man understood that he was made in the image of God when heunderstood God by aggrandizing, unto infinity, the idea he had of himself.In understanding God as an infinite man, man says of himself; I am the finiteGod.Magic differs from mysticism in that it does not make a priori judgments untilafter having established the a posteriori basis for those judgments, that is tosay after having understood the cause through the effects contained in the veryenergy of the cause, by means of the universal law of analogy; also in theoccult sciences everything is real, and theories are only established on thebasis of experience. Realities make up the proportions of the ideal, and themage only admits something as certain into the domain of ideas that has beendemonstrated by realization. In other terms, what is true in the cause becomesrealized in the effect. What does not become realized is not. The realization ofthe word, is the Verb properly speaking. A thought is realized in becomingspeech; it is realized by the signs, by the sounds, and by the depictions of thesigns: that is the first degree of realization. The thought is then imprintedupon the astral light by means of the signs of writing or of speech; itinfluences other minds by being reflected in them; it refracts when crossing thediaphane of other men, and takes on new forms and proportions, which are thentranslated into acts which modify society and the world: that is the last degreeof realization. Men born into a world modified by an idea carry within them itsimprint, and this is also how the Verb is made flesh. The imprint of Adam’sdisobedience, conserved within the astral light, could not be erased except bythe stronger imprint of the obedience of the Savior, and it is thus that we canexplain original sin and redemption in a natural and magical sense.The astral light or the world soul was the instrument of Adam’s omnipotence,which then became the instrument of his torment, after having been corrupted andconfused by his sin, which was to confuse an impure reflection with theprimitive images which composed, for his still virgin imagination, the book ofuniversal science.The astral light, depicted in the ancient symbols by a serpent biting its tail,represented in turns vice and prudence, time and eternity, the tempter and theRedemptor. This light, being the vehicle of life, can serve as much as theauxiliary to good as to evil, and can be taken for the fiery form of Satan asmuch as for the body of the Holy Spirit. It is the universal weapon in thebattle between the angels, and it feeds the flames of hell as much as thelightning of St. Michael. We can compare it to a horse whose nature is analogousto that of the chameleon and who will always reflect the armor of its rider.The astral light is the realization or the form of the intellectual light, justas the latter is the realization or the form of the divine light.The great initiator of Christianity, understanding that the astral light wasoverburdened with the impure reflections of Roman depravity, wished to separatehis disciples from the ambient sphere of reflections and have them pay attentiononly to the interior light, so that through a common faith they couldcommunicate together via new magnetic cords which he called grace, and thusvanquish the overwhelmed currents of universal magnetism, to which he gave thenames of devil and Satan, to express their putrefied state. To oppose onecurrent against another current is to renew the power of fluidic life. For thatmatter, the prophets simply figured out, through the accuracy of theircalculations, the propitious time for moral reactions.The law of realization produces what we call magnetic respiration, with whichobjects and places are impregnated, and which gives them an influence inconformity with our dominant desires, especially those objects and places whichare confirmed and realized by acts. In fact, the universal agent, or the latentastral light, always searches for equilibrium; it fills the void and sucks inthe full, which renders vice contagious like certain physical maladies andpowerfully serves proselytism and virtue. It is for this reason that thecohabitation of antipathetic beings is an ordeal; it is for this reason that therelics, either of the saints or of the great evildoers, can produce suddensupernatural conversions or perversions; it is for this reason that sexual lovecan often be produced by a breath or by touch, and not only by the touch of theperson themselves but through objects that they have touched or magnetizedwithout knowing it.The soul inhales and exhales exactly like the body. It inhales what it believesto be happiness, and exhales the ideas which result from its intimatesensations. Sickly souls have bad breath and vitiate their moral atmosphere,that is to say they mix impure reflections with the astral light whichpenetrates them, thus creating harmful currents. We are often surprised when weare assailed, in public, by bad thoughts which we would not have thoughtpossible of ourselves, and we do not realize that they are due to some unhealthynearby person. This is a secret of great importance, because it leads to themanifestation of the conscience, one of the most incontestable and terriblepowers of the art of magic.Magnetic respiration produces a radiation around the soul of which it is thecenter, and it surrounds itself with the reflection of its works, which makes aheaven or a hell for itself. There are no solitary acts and there can be nohidden acts; all that we truly want, that is to say all of which we confirm byour acts, remains written in the astral light, where our reflections are kept;these reflections continually influence our thoughts through the mediation ofthe diaphane, and it is thus that we become and we remain the child of our ownworks.The astral light, transformed into human light at the moment of conception, isthe first mantle of the soul, and, by combining with the most subtle fluids, itforms the ethereal body, or the astral ghost, of which Paracelsus speaks of inhis philosophy of intuition (Philosophia sagax). This astral body, whendeparting the body at death, attracts to itself, and keeps for a long time,through the sympathy between homogeneous matter, the reflections of its passedlife; if a powerfully sympathetic will attracts it into a particular current,the astral body manifests itself naturally, because there is nothing morenatural than miracles. It is thus that apparitions are produced. But we willdevelop this more completely in the chapter dedicated to Necromancy.This fluidic body, which like the mass of astral light is subjected to twocontrary movements, the attractive to the left and the repulsive to the right,or, reciprocally, in the two sexes, produces in us the struggles betweendifferent attractions and contributes to the anxiety of our conscience: often itis influenced by other spirits, and thus are produced either temptations orsubtle and unexpected grace. This is also the explanation for the traditionaldogma of the two angels who help us and test us. The two forces of the astrallight can be depicted by a balance where our good intentions for the triumph ofjustice and the emancipation of our liberty are weighed.The astral body is not always of the same sex as the terrestrial body, which isto say that the proportions of the two forces, varying from right to left, oftenseem to contradict the visible organism; this is what produces the apparenterrors in human passion and can explain, without in any way justifying themmorally, the amorous singularities of Anacreon or of Sappho.151[9781101992746_EPUB-14__5.xhtml]A skilled magnetizer must be able to appreciate all these nuances, and weprovide in our Ritual the means of recognizing them.There are two types of realizations, the true and the fantastic. The first isthe exclusive secret of magicians; the other belongs to enchanters andsorcerers.Myths are fantastic realizations of religious dogma, superstitions are thespells of false piety, but myths and superstitions act more effectively upon thehuman will than a purely speculative philosophy which excludes all practice. Itis for this reason that Saint Paul opposes the conquests of the folly of theCross to the inertia of human wisdom. Religion realizes philosophy by adaptingit to the weaknesses of the vulgar: according to the Cabalists this is thesecret reason and occult explanation for the dogmas of incarnation and ofredemption.Thoughts which are not translated into speech are thoughts which are lost tohumanity; words which are not confirmed by acts are idle words, and there is notfar to go from idle speech to lies.It is thought formulated into words and confirmed by acts which constitutes thegood deed or the crime. Thus either by vice or by virtue, there is no speech forwhich we are not responsible; moreover, there are no indifferent acts.Maledictions and benedictions always have an effect, and all action, whatever itmay be, whether it is inspired by love or by hate, produces effects analogous toits motive, its reach, and its direction. The emperor whose images had beenmutilated, and who, as he brought his hand to his face, said: “I have not beenhurt,” made a false appraisal and by it diminished the merit of his clemency.What honorable man can look calmly upon the insults made to his portrait? Andwhat if such insults, even done without our knowledge, fell upon us throughtheir fatal influence; what if the art of enchantments was real, as the adept isnot permitted to doubt, how much more would we find the words of the emperorimprudent and reckless!There are people that one can never offend with impunity, and if one’s offenseto them is fatal, then one begins to die from that point on. There are those onecannot encounter without it having an effect and whose gaze can change thedirection of one’s life. The basilisk who kills with its gaze is not a fable; itis a magical allegory. In general, it is bad for your health to have enemies,and one cannot brave anyone’s disapproval with impunity. Before opposing a forceor a current, one must assure oneself that one has the strength or that one issupported by the contrary current; otherwise one will be crushed or struck down,and many sudden deaths have no other cause. The terrible deaths of Nadab andAbihu, of Uzziah, of Ananias and Sapphira,152 [9781101992746_EPUB-14__6.xhtml]were caused by the electrical currents of the beliefs of those they hadoffended; the torments of the Ursuline nuns of Loudun,153[9781101992746_EPUB-14__7.xhtml] of the nuns of Louviers,154[9781101992746_EPUB-14__8.xhtml] and of the Jansenist convulsionaries,155[9781101992746_EPUB-14__9.xhtml] were due to the same principle and areexplained by the same natural occult laws. If Urbain Grandier156[9781101992746_EPUB-14_10.xhtml] had not been executed, one of two things wouldhave occurred, either the possessed nuns would have died in terrible convulsionsor a phenomenon of diabolical frenzy would have overcome them, and inmultiplying so many wills by so much power, Grandier, despite his science andreason, would himself have suffered from hallucinations to the point of accusinghimself like the unfortunate Gaufridi157 [9781101992746_EPUB-14_11.xhtml] haddone before him, or he would have died suddenly under all the terriblecircumstances of a poisoning or divine vengeance.In the eighteenth century, the unfortunate poet Gilbert fell victim to his ownaudacity in braving the current of popular opinion and even the philosophicalfanaticism of his era.158 [9781101992746_EPUB-14_12.xhtml] Guilty ofphilosophical treason, he died raving mad, assailed by the most incredibleterrors, as if God himself had punished him for having inappropriately defendedHis cause. In actual fact, he died a victim of a law of nature that he could nothave known: he had opposed himself against an electrical current and was struckdown.If Marat had not been assassinated by Charlotte Corday,159[9781101992746_EPUB-14__1.xhtml] he would certainly have been killed by areaction from public opinion. That which caused his leprosy was the hatred ofdecent, everyday people, and he had to fall victim to it.The public disapproval which arose due to the Saint Bartholomew’s Day massacrewas the sole cause of the horrible sickness and subsequent death of CharlesIX,160 [9781101992746_EPUB-14__2.xhtml] and Henry IV,161[9781101992746_EPUB-14__3.xhtml] if he had not been supported by his immensepopularity, which he owed to the power of projection or the sympathetic strengthof his astral life, Henry IV, we say, would not have survived long after hisconversion, and would have died due to the scorn of the Protestants, combinedwith the distrust and resentment of the Catholics.Unpopularity can be a proof of integrity and of courage, but it is never a proofof prudence or good politics; injuries done to public opinion are deadly for menof the State. We can remind ourselves again of the premature and violent ends ofseveral famous men, whom it is not convenient to mention here.Stigmatization due to public opinion can be of great injustice, but it will inany case always be the reason for lack of success, and often for sudden death.On the other hand, the injustices caused to a single man can and should, if wedo not notice them, cause the downfall of an entire people or society: it iswhat we call the cry of the blood, because at the heart of all injustice thereis the germ of a homicide.It is because of these terrible laws of solidarity that Christianity so highlyrecommends forgiveness of insults and reconciliation. He who dies withoutforgiving throws himself into eternity armed with a dagger and devotes himselfto the horrors of eternal murder.The effectiveness of paternal or maternal benedictions or maledictions is atraditional and overwhelming belief among the people. In fact, the more that theties which unite two people are close, the more that the hatred between them hasterrible effects. Althea’s brand which burns up the blood of Meleager is, inmythology, the symbol of this formidable power.162[9781101992746_EPUB-14__4.xhtml] Parents should always take heed, because onedoes not kindle hell in one’s own blood and one does not curse one’s ownchildren without being burnt and cursed oneself. It is never a crime to forgive,and it is always dangerous and evil to cast a curse."},{"pageContent":"9 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-15_vector-1.jpg] I.INITIATIONYESOD.BONUM.163 [9781101992746_EPUB-15_fn.xhtml]The initiate is he who possesses the lamp of Trismegistus, the mantle ofApollonius, and the staff of the patriarchs.Trismegistus’s lamp is reason enlightened by science; Apollonius’s mantle isfull and whole self-possession, which isolates the sage from the instinctivecurrents; and the staff of the patriarchs is the assistance of the occult andperpetual forces of nature.Trismegistus’s lamp illuminates the present, the past, and the future; lays barethe conscience of man; and illuminates the most hidden secrets of women. Thelamp shines with a triple flame; the mantle is folded three times; the staff isdivided into three parts.The number nine is that of the divine reflections: it expresses the divine ideain all its abstract power, but it also expresses the extravagance in belief and,in consequence, superstition and idolatry.That is why Hermes made it the number of initiation, because the initiate reignsover superstition and through superstition. Only he can walk in the darkness,supported as he is by his staff, enveloped in his mantle and illuminated by hislamp.Reason was given to all men, but not all men know how to make use of it; it is ascience which must be learned. Liberty is offered to all, but not everyone canbe free; it is a right which must be won. Strength is for all, but not everyoneknows how to rely on it; it is a power which must be seized.We arrive at nothing if it requires no effort. The destiny of man is that heenriches himself with what he gains, and that, then, like God, he basks in theglory and pleasure of giving.The magical science was once called the priestly and royal art, becauseinitiation gave the sage dominion over souls and the aptitude to govern wills.Divination is also a privilege of the initiate; since divination is simply theknowledge of the effects contained in the causes, and science applied to thefacts of the universal doctrine of analogy.Human acts are not only written in the astral light, they also leave theirtraces on the face, they modify one’s bearing and walk, they change the tone ofone’s voice.Every man thus carries with him the story of his life, which may be read by aninitiate. The future is always the consequence of the past, and unexpectedcircumstances barely change the rationally expected results.We can thus predict each man’s destiny. We can judge an entire existence basedon a single movement; a single bit of awkwardness presages a series ofmisfortunes. Caesar was assassinated because he blushed in embarrassment due tobeing bald; Napoleon died on St. Helena because he liked the poems of Ossian;164[9781101992746_EPUB-15__1.xhtml] Louis Philippe had to leave the throne as hedid because he carried an umbrella.165 [9781101992746_EPUB-15__2.xhtml] Theseare paradoxes for the vulgar, who do not understand the occult relations ofthings, but they are reasons for the initiate, who understands all and issurprised by nothing.The initiation protects a person from the false lights of mysticism; it giveshuman reason its relative value and its proportional infallibility, by linkingit to supreme reason through the chain of analogies.Thus the initiate has neither doubtful hopes nor absurd fears, because he has nounreasonable beliefs; he knows what he is capable of, and it costs him nothingto dare to do it. So for him to dare something is to be able to do it.Here then is a new interpretation of the attributes of the initiate: his lamprepresents knowledge, the mantle which envelops him represents discretion, andhis staff is the emblem of his strength and audacity. He knows, he dares, and hekeeps silent.He knows the secrets of the future, he dares in the present, and he stays silentabout the past.He knows the weaknesses of the human heart, he dares to make use of them tocomplete his work, and he does not speak about his projects.He knows the reason for all the symbolisms and all the cults, he dares topractice them or to abstain from doing so without hypocrisy and without impiety,and he does not speak about the unique doctrine of high initiation.He knows of the existence and the nature of the great magical agent, he dares toperform the acts and pronounce the words which subject it to human will, and hedoes not speak of the mysteries of the great arcanum.You may also notice that he is often sad, never beaten nor desperate; oftenpoor, never degraded nor miserable; often persecuted, never deterred norvanquished. He remembers the bereavement and the murder of Orpheus, the exileand solitary death of Moses, the martyrdom of the prophets, the tortures ofApollonius, the cross of the Savior; he knows in what abandonment Agrippa died,whose memory is still denigrated; he knows to what weariness the greatParacelsus succumbed, and all that which Raymond Lully must have suffered to atlast arrive at a bloody death. He remembers Swedenborg pretending to be mad, oreven actually losing his reason, so as to have his science pardoned; heremembers Saint-Martin, who hid all his life;166[9781101992746_EPUB-15__3.xhtml] Cagliostro, who died abandoned in the dungeonsof the Inquisition; Cazotte,167 [9781101992746_EPUB-15__4.xhtml] who climbed thescaffold. As the successor to so many victims, the initiate does not dare less,but he understands even more the necessity to keep quiet.Let us imitate his example, let us learn through perseverance; when we know, letus dare and let us stay silent."},{"pageContent":"10 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-1.jpg] K.THE CABALAMALKUTH.PRINCIPIUM.PHALLUS.168 [9781101992746_EPUB-16_fn.xhtml]All religions have preserved the memory of a primordial book written in picturesby the sages of the world’s first centuries, and whose symbols, which were lateron simplified and vulgarized, provided writing with its letters, the Verb withits characters, and occult philosophy with its mysterious signs and pentacles.This book, attributed by the Hebrews to Enoch, the seventh master of the world,attributed to Hermes Trismegistus by the Egyptians, and attributed to Cadmus,the mysterious founder of the Holy City,169 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__6.xhtml] bythe Greeks, was the symbolic summary of the original tradition, which has sincebeen named Kabbalah or Cabala, from a Hebrew word which is the equivalent oftradition.170 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__7.xhtml]This tradition rests entirely on the unique doctrine of magic: the visible isfor us the proportional measure of the invisible. The ancients observed thatequilibrium is, in physics, a universal law, which results in the apparentopposition of two forces, and they then derived metaphysical equilibrium fromphysical equilibrium, and declared that in God, that is to say the first livingand active cause, we should be able to recognize two properties that arenecessary to one another: stability and movement, necessity and liberty,rational order and willful autonomy, justice and love, and in consequence alsoseverity and mercy; and it is these two attributes which the Jewish Cabalists ina way personified with the names Geburah and Chesed.Above Geburah and Chesed resides the supreme crown, the balancing power, theprinciple of the balanced world or kingdom, that we find designated by the nameMalkuth in the occult and Cabalistic verses of the Lord’s Prayer, of which wehave already spoken.But Geburah and Chesed, maintained in equilibrium from above by the crown andfrom below by the kingdom, are two principles that we can consider, either inthe abstract or in their realization. As abstraction or idealization, they takeon their superior names of Chokmah, wisdom, and Binah, intelligence. Whenrealized, they are called stability and progress, that is to say eternity andvictory: Hod and Netzach.According to the Cabala, this is the basis for all religions and for allsciences, the first and immutable idea of things: a triple triangle and acircle, the ternary idea explained by balance multiplied by itself in thedomains of the ideal, and then the realization of that idea in forms. Theancients then tied the first notions of this simple and grand theology to theidea of numbers, qualifying all the numbers of the original decade as follows: 1. Kether.—The Crown, the balancing power. 2. Chokmah.—Wisdom, balanced in its immutable order by the initiative of intelligence. 3. Binah.—Active Intelligence, balanced by Wisdom. 4. Chesed.—Mercy, the second conception of Wisdom, always benevolent, because it is strong. 5. Geburah.—The Rigor necessitated by Wisdom itself and by benevolence. To suffer evil is to hold back good. 6. Tiphareth.—Beauty, luminous and balanced conception in the forms, the intermediary between the crown and the kingdom, the principle mediator between the creator and creation. (What a sublime and poetic idea do we not find here of His sovereign calling!) 7. Netzach.—Victory, that is to say the eternal triumph of intelligence and justice. 8. Hod.—The Eternity of victories of spirit over matter, of the active over the passive, of life over death. 9. Yesod.—The Foundation, that is to say the basis of all belief and all truth, it is what we call in philosophy the ABSOLUTE. 10. Malkuth.—The Kingdom, it is the universe, it is all of creation, the work and the mirror of God, the proof of supreme reason, the formal consequence which forces us to climb back up to the virtual premises, the enigma whose word is God, that is to say: supreme and absolute reason.These ten first notions attached to the ten first characters of the originalalphabet, signifying both the principles and the numbers, are what the mastersof the Cabala call the ten Sephiroth.The sacred tetragrammaton, drawn in this manner,[image/Doctrine_Magic_11.jpg]indicates the number, the source, and the relationship of the divine names. Itis in the name of Iot-Chavah, written with these twenty-four signs crowned witha triple crown of light, that one must find the twenty-four thrones of heavenand the twenty-four crowned elders of the Book of Revelation. In the Cabala, theoccult principle is called the Ancient of Days, and this principle multipliedand as if reflected in the second causes creates these images, that is to saythere are as many old men as there are diverse concepts of His unique essence.These images, less perfect as they move away from their source, cast a finalreflection or a final glimmer in the darkness which represents a horrible anddisfigured old man: it is what is coarsely referred to as the devil. Thus aninitiate dared to say: “The devil is God as understood by the wicked”; andanother, in stranger, but no less vigorous terms, added: “The devil is formedfrom the rifts within God.” We could summarize and explain these very originalassertions by remarking that, within the symbolism itself, the demon is an angelfallen from heaven for having wished to usurp the divinity. This pertains to theallegorical language of the prophets and of legends. Philosophically speaking,the devil is a human idea of divinity surpassed and dispossessed of heaventhrough the progress of science and of reason. Moloch, Adramelech, and Baal,171[9781101992746_EPUB-16__8.xhtml] were all, for the primordial Orientals, thepersonifications of the unique god, disgraced by barbaric attributes. The god ofthe Jansenists, in creating hell for the majority of humans and basking in theeternal tortures of those he had not wished to save, is an even more barbaricidea than that of Moloch:172 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__9.xhtml] and thus the godof the Jansenists is already, for wise and enlightened Christians, a veritableSatan fallen from heaven.The Cabalists, in multiplying the divine names, related them all either to theunity of the Tetragrammaton, or to the ternary figure, or to the Sephirothicladder of the decad; they draw the ladder of the divine names and numbers likethis:[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-2.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-3.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-4.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-5.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-6.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-7.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-8.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-9.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-10.jpg][image/56.jpg]173 [9781101992746_EPUB-16_10.xhtml]a triangle that we can translate into Roman letters as follows:JJASDIJEHUELOHIMSABAOTARARITAELVEDAATELIM GIBORELIM SABAOTThe aggregation of all these divine names formed from the unique Tetragrammaton,but outside of the Tetragrammaton itself, is one of the bases of the Hebrewritual, and makes up the occult power the Cabalistic rabbis invoke under thename of Shemhamphorash.174 [9781101992746_EPUB-16_11.xhtml]We have spoken here about the Tarot cards from the Cabalistic point of view. Wehave already indicated the occult source of their name. This hieroglyphic bookis composed of a Cabalistic alphabet and a wheel or circle of four decades,specified by four symbolic and typical figures, each having as a spoke in thewheel a ladder of progressive figures representing Humanity: man, woman, youngman, and child; master, mistress, warrior, and valet. The twenty-two charactersof the alphabet represent first of all the thirteen doctrines, then the ninebeliefs authorized by the Hebrew religion, a powerful religion founded upon thehighest reason.Here is the religious and Cabalistic key of the Tarot, expressed in verses inthe manner of the ancient legislators:1[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-11.jpg]All things proclaim an active, thinking cause.2[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-12.jpg]The living unity heeds number’s laws.3[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-13.jpg]That which contains all is by nothing bound.4[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-14.jpg]Before all else, He everywhere is found.5[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-15.jpg]He, the sole Master—praise to Him alone!6[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-16.jpg]To pure hearts His true doctrine He makes known.7[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-17.jpg]Faith’s works a single guide have, under heaven.8[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-18.jpg]So one sole altar and one law are given.9[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-19.jpg]What the Eternal founds, forever stays.10[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-20.jpg]From high, down to our time, He rules each phase.11[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-21.jpg]Great is His mercy, and His wrath severe.12[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-22.jpg]He sends a king unto His people dear.13[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-23.jpg]The tomb but leads to new lands by and by,Life is immortal, death alone shall die.Such are the pure doctrines, the sacred immutabilities; Let us now conclude withthe revered numbers.14[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-24.jpg]The angel of good brings temperance and peace.15[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-25.jpg]The other, pride and anger without cease.16[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-26.jpg]The lightning and the fire heed God’s commands.17[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-27.jpg]The evening star’s sweet dew is in His Hands.18[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-28.jpg]He sets the Moon to watch our ways forlorn.19[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-29.jpg]His Sun, the source wherein all is reborn.20[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-30.jpg]The dust of tombs is raised up by His breath.0 or 21[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-31.jpg]Where countless mortals stumble down to death.21 or 22[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-32.jpg]Above the Mercy Seat shines His bright crown,As from above the cherubs He looks down.With the aid of this purely doctrinal commentary, we can already understand thefigures of the Cabalistic alphabet of the Tarot. Thus figure No. 1, called theMage, represents the active principle in the unity of the divine and humanself-regulation; figure No. 2, crudely called the Priestess, describes thedogmatic unity founded upon the numbers, it is the Cabala or Gnosis personified;No. 3 represents divine Spirituality under the symbol of a winged female whoholds in one hand the apocalyptic eagle, and, in the other, the world attachedto the end of her scepter. The other figures are just as clear and as easilyexplainable as these first ones.Let us now get to the fours signs, that is to say Wands, Cups, Swords, andCircles or Pentacles, crudely called Coins. These symbols are the hieroglyphs ofthe Tetragrammaton: thus, the Wand, is the phallus of the Egyptians or the Yodhof the Hebrews; the Cup is the cteis175 [9781101992746_EPUB-16_12.xhtml] or theprimordial Heh; the Sword is the conjunction of the two, or the lingam,symbolized in precaptivity Hebrew by the Vav, and the Circle or Pentacle, theimage of the world, is the final Heh of the divine name.Now let us take the Tarot and gather together, four by four, all the pages whichform Guillaume Postel’s Wheel or ROTA; let us place together the four aces, thefours twos, etc., and we will have ten packs of cards which provide thehieroglyphic explanation of the triangle and the divine names on the decimalscale which we have provided above. We can then read them thus, by relating eachnumber to the corresponding Sephirot:[image/9781101992746_EPUB-16_vector-33.jpg]Four letters make the Name that rules all names.1 KetherThe four Aces.The crown of God has four uprising flames.2 ChokmahThe four Twos.Four streams lead Wisdom out to all four sides.3 BinahThe four Threes.Four proofs of Understanding He provides.4 ChesedThe four Fours.Four blessings unto us His Mercy moves.5 GeburahThe four Fives.Four times four crimes Severity reproves.6 TipharethThe four Sixes.His Beauty is revealed through four pure rays.7 NetzachThe four Sevens.Four times His mighty Victory we praise.8 HodThe four Eights.Four times He triumphs in Eternity.9 YesodThe four Nines.Beneath His throne, Foundations four we see.10 MalkuthThe four Tens.His unique Kingdom is four times the same,Conforming ever to His crown of flame.We see by this simple arrangement the Cabalistic meaning of each card. Thus, forexample, the five of wands strictly symbolizes the Geburah of Yod, that is tosay the justice of the Creator or the anger of man; the seven of cups signifiesthe victory of mercy or the triumph of woman; the eight of swords signifiesconflict or eternal equilibrium; and so on. We can understand in this way howthe ancient pontiffs proceeded in order to make this oracle speak: the cardscast randomly always provided a new Cabalistic meaning, but rigorously true intheir combination, which was the only fortuitous aspect; and since the ancients’faith did not accept anything as accidental, they read the answers provided byProvidence in the oracles of the Tarot, which the Hebrews called Teraph orTeraphim,176 [9781101992746_EPUB-16_13.xhtml] just as the first Cabalisticscholar, Gaffarel,177 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__1.xhtml] one of CardinalRichelieu’s official magicians, had sensed.As to the four court cards, here is a final couplet to explain them:King, Queen, Knight, Page.Husband, young man, child, all humanity,By these four rungs, climb back to unity.At the end of the Ritual we will provide more details and complete documentsregarding the marvelous book of the Tarot, and we will demonstrate that it isthe primordial book, the key to all the prophecies and all the dogmas, in oneword the book which inspired all inspired books, which was neither intuited byCourt de Gébelin through his science, nor Alliette or Etteilla178[9781101992746_EPUB-16__2.xhtml] through his singular intuitions.The ten Sephiroth and the twenty-two Tarot trumps form what the Cabalists callthe thirty-two Paths of Wisdom. As to particular sciences, they divide them intofifty chapters, which they call the Fifty Gates (we know that “door” signifiesgovernment or authority for the Orientals).179 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__3.xhtml]The rabbis also divide the Cabala into Bereshith, or universal Genesis, andMerkabah, or Ezekiel’s chariot;180 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__4.xhtml] then, fromthe two ways of interpreting the Cabalistic alphabet they form two sciences,called Gematria and Temurah,181 [9781101992746_EPUB-16__5.xhtml] and with themthey form that well-known art, which is nothing other than the complete scienceof the symbols of the Tarot and their complex and varied use in the divinationof all secrets, of philosophy, or of nature, or even of the future. We willspeak again about this in chapter 20 of this book."},{"pageContent":"11 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-17_vector-1.jpg] L.THE MAGICAL CHAINMANUS.STRENGTH.182 [9781101992746_EPUB-17_fn.xhtml]The great magical agent, which we have called the astral light, which otherscall the world soul, which the ancient alchemists refer to under the names ofAzoth and Magnesia, this unique and incontestable occult force is the key to allinfluences, the secret to all the powers; it is Medea’s flying dragon, themysterious serpent of Eden; it is the universal mirror of visions, the knot ofsympathies, the source of love, of prophecy, and of glory. To take possession ofthis agent is to have the powers of God himself; all real, effective magic, alltrue occult power, comes from it, and all the true books of science have noother goal than to demonstrate this.In order to take possession of the great magical agent, two operations arerequired: to concentrate and project; in other terms, to fixate and move.The author of all things provided stability as a foundation and guarantee formovement; the mage must act in the same manner.We say that enthusiasm is contagious. Why? It is because enthusiasm is notproduced without fixed beliefs. Faith produces faith; to want with reason is towant with a, I will not say infinite, but with an indefinite power.That which acts in the intellectual and moral sphere affects the physical worldeven more; and when Archimedes called for a fulcrum with which to raise theworld, he was simply looking for the great magical arcanum. On one of the armsof the hermaphrodite drawn by Heinrich Khunrath183[9781101992746_EPUB-17__8.xhtml] we read this word: COAGULA, and on the otherarm: SOLVE.To gather and to disperse are the two verbs of nature; but how does one gather,and how does one disperse the astral light or the world soul?We gather in isolation, and we disperse through the magical chain.The isolation of thought means absolute independence, the isolation of the heartis total liberty, the isolation of the senses is perfect abstinence.Any man who has prejudices and fears, any individual who is a slave to hispassions, is incapable of gathering or coagulating, to use Khunrath’sexpression, the astral light or world soul.All true adepts were independent under torture, sober and chaste until death;and the reason for this anomaly is that, to command a force, you cannot be takenover by that force to such an extent that it commands you.But then, those men will cry out who look to magic as a means of satisfyingtheir natural desires, what use does this power serve if one cannot use it tosatisfy oneself? If I told you, you poor people who ask such a question, howwould you understand me? Are pearls then nothing, because they have no value forEpicurus’s flock of piglets?184 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__9.xhtml] Did Curtius notfind it more worthwhile to command those who had gold rather than to possess ithimself?185 [9781101992746_EPUB-17_10.xhtml] Does one not need to be a littlemore than just an ordinary man if one hopes to become godlike? Incidentally, Iam sorry to distress or discourage you, but I am not reinventing the highsciences here; I teach them and I am attesting to their strict requirements bymentioning their primary and most inexorable conditions.Pythagoras was a chaste and sober free man; Apollonius of Tyana and the emperorJulian were men of frightful austerity; people questioned Paracelsus’s sex, soresistant was he to amorous temptations; Raymond Lully pushed the strictures ofhis life to the point of the most exalted asceticism; Girolamo Cardano soexaggerated his practice of fasting that he almost died of starvation, if we areto believe tradition; Agrippa, poor and running from town to town, almost diedof penury rather than submit to the caprices of a princess who threatened theliberty of science. What, then, was happiness for these men? Knowledge of thegreat secrets and the understanding of power. That was enough for these greatindividuals. Must one be like them to know what they knew? Certainly not, andthis book which I write is the proof; but, to do what they did, it is absolutelynecessary to use the same means that they used.But what did they actually do? They surprised and enthralled the world, theyreigned more truly than kings. Magic is an instrument of divine grace ordiabolical pride, but it is death to the joys of the world and the pleasures ofa mortal life.Then what is the use of studying it? the Epicureans would say.—Simply to know, and perhaps also to learn to guard against stupid incredulityand puerile credulity. Men of pleasure (and for half of those men I count many awoman), is it not a very great pleasure to satisfy curiosity? Read on, then,without fear, for you shall never become magicians against your own will.But these dispositions of absolute renouncement are only necessary forestablishing the universal currents and changing the face of the world; thereare magical operations, relative to and limited within a given circle, which donot require such heroic virtues. We can act upon the passions with passions,determine the sympathies and antipathies, even afflict and heal, without havingthe omnipotence of the mage; one must simply be forewarned of the risk that oneruns of a reaction proportional to any action and to which one can easily fallvictim. All this is explained in the Ritual.To create a magical chain is to establish a magnetic current which becomesstronger depending on the length of the chain. We shall see in the Ritual howthese currents can be produced, and the different manners of forming a chain.Mesmer’s wooden tub was a rather imperfect magical chain; many great circles ofthe illumined, in various northern countries, have more powerful chains. Even acertain society of Catholic priests famous for their occult powers and theirunpopularity186 [9781101992746_EPUB-17_11.xhtml] was established according tothe plan and following the requirements of the most powerful magical chains, andthat is the secret of their power, which they attribute solely to grace or thewill of God, a vulgar and easy solution to all the questions regarding theeffects of power upon influence or upon unconscious impulses. In our Ritual, wewill assess the value of the series of truly magical ceremonies and evocationswhich make up the Great Work of that vocation under the name of the exercises ofSaint Ignatius.Every enthusiasm propagated in society due to a series of communications andpredetermined practices produces a magnetic current that is also conserved oraugmented by that current. The effect of the current is to enchant and oftenoverly stimulate impressionable and weak persons, excitable constitutions, andtemperaments disposed to hysteria or hallucinations. These persons soon becomepowerful vehicles for magical power and strongly project the astral light in thesame direction as the current; thus to oppose oneself to manifestations of poweris in a way to fight against destiny. When the young Pharisee called Saul orSchol had thrown himself, with all the fanaticism and stubbornness of asectarian, in the way of the invading Christian religion, he unknowingly puthimself at the mercy of the power he thought he was fighting; he was immediatelystruck by a formidable magnetic bolt, rendered even more immediate no doubt bythe combined effects of cerebral congestion and sunburn.187[9781101992746_EPUB-17_12.xhtml] The conversion of the young Israelite AlphonseRatisbonne is a contemporary example of precisely the same nature.188[9781101992746_EPUB-17_13.xhtml] We know of such a sect of enthusiasts, whompeople mock from a distance but join despite themselves when they approach them,even if it is to fight against them. I would add that magical circles andmagnetic currents are established on their own, and in accordance with theirinexorable laws influence those who submit to their effects. Each one of us isattracted into a circle of relations which is their world and under which we areinfluenced. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, that legislator of the French Revolution,that man which the most spiritual nation in the world accepted as theincarnation of reason, was dragged into the saddest act of his life, theabandonment of his children, through the magnetic influence of a circle oflibertines and due to the magnetic current from a dinner service. He naively andsimply gives an account of this in his Confessions, and it is an event no onehad noticed. Great circles make great men, and vice versa. There are nomisunderstood geniuses; there are eccentric men, and that word seems to havebeen invented by an adept.189 [9781101992746_EPUB-17_14.xhtml] A man eccentricin his genius is one who looks to form a circle and fights against the centralforces of attraction of magical chains and established currents. His destiny isto be broken by the fight or to succeed. What is the dual condition for such asuccess? A central fixed point and a persevering circular initiative. The man ofgenius is one who has discovered a real law, and in consequence possesses aninvincible power of action and direction. He may die before completing his work,but what he wished for is accomplished despite his death, and often because ofhis death: because death is a veritable assumption for the genius. “And I, if Ibe lifted up from the earth,” said one of the greatest initiators, “will drawall men unto me.”190 [9781101992746_EPUB-17_15.xhtml]The law of magnetic currents is that of the movement of the astral light itself.This movement is always dual and multiplies itself in the opposite direction. Agreat action always entails an equal reaction, and the secret of great successis all about predicting the reactions. It is in this manner that Chateaubriand,inspired by his disgust for the revolutionary saturnalia, predicted and preparedthe immense success of his Génie de christianisme. To oppose oneself to acurrent which is beginning its circle, is to wish to be broken as the great andunfortunate emperor Julian was; to oppose a current which has run the entirecircle of its action is to take the head of the opposing current. A great man ishe who arrives in time and who knows how to innovate appropriately. Voltaire, ifhe had been born in the time of the apostles, would have been unable to find anecho for his words and would perhaps have been no more than an ingeniousparasite at the banquets of Trimalchio.191 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__1.xhtml] Inthe era in which we live, everything is ready for a new explosion of evangelicalenthusiasm and Christian selflessness, precisely because of the universaldisenchantment with egotistical positivism and a cynical public with the crudestof appetites. The success of certain books and the mystical tendencies in peopleare unequivocal symptoms of this general disposition. We are restoring thechurches and are building new ones; the more we feel empty of beliefs, the morewe hope for them; the entire world again awaits for the Messiah, and it will notbe long before he arrives. Thus there will be, for example, someone who ishighly placed due to his rank or his wealth, a pope, a king, or even a Jewishmillionaire, who will publicly and solemnly sacrifice all of his materialinterests in the name of the salvation of humanity; he will become the redemptorof the poor, the actual propagator and even the victim of the doctrines ofdevotion and charity, and he will cause a great upswelling of support around himand a complete moral upheaval in the world. But the high position of this personis what is most necessary because, in our time of misery and charlatanism, allVerbs coming from below bear the suspicion of having arisen out of ambition andself-interested deceit. You, then, who are nothing and have nothing, do not hopeto be among either the apostles or the messiahs. Do you have faith and do youwish to act upon your faith? Then first achieve the means to act, which is theinfluence which comes with rank and the prestige of wealth. In the past wecreated gold with science, today we must remake science with gold. We fixed thevolatile, now we must make volatile the fixed; in other terms, we materializedthe spirit, we must now spiritualize matter. The most sublime word is not heardtoday if it does not have the guarantee of a name, that is to say of a successwhich represents material value. How much is a manuscript worth? What theauthor’s signature is worth in the bookstore. The business firm Alexandre Dumasand Co., for example, represents one of the greatest literary guarantees in ourtime; but the Dumas brand is only valued for its habitual products: novels. WereDumas to devise some magnificent utopia or an admirable solution for ourreligious problems, we would consider his discoveries as the amusing caprices ofa novelist, and no one would take them seriously, despite the European fame ofthe Panurge192 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__2.xhtml] of modern literature. We are ina century of established positions: everyone is worth what he is worth sociallyand commercially. The unlimited liberty of speech produces so much argument thatwe no longer ask today: What does he say? But: Who said so? If it is Rothschild,or His Holiness Pius IX, or even Monsignor Dupanloup,193[9781101992746_EPUB-17__3.xhtml] then that is something. If it is justso-and-so, even if so-and-so is (which is entirely possible, after all) aprodigy or even an ignored genius of science and good sense, then it is nothing.To those who would then tell me: If you have the secret to great success and thepower to change the world, why do you not use it? I would answer: This sciencecame to me too late, and I lost a great deal, in order to acquire it, of thetime and resources which might allow me to make use of it; but I offer it up tothose who are in a position to use it. Famous men, the rich and great of thisworld, who are not satisfied with what you have, and who sense in your heart amore noble and vaster ambition, do you wish to become the fathers of a newworld, the kings of a renewed civilization? A poor and obscure savant has foundArchimedes’s lever, and he offers it to you solely for the good of humanity,without asking you for anything in exchange.The phenomena which recently agitated America and Europe with regard to talkingtables and fluidic manifestations194 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__4.xhtml] arenothing other than magnetic currents which are beginning to form, andsolicitations whose nature is to invite us, in the name of the salvation ofhumanity, to reconstitute the great sympathetic and religious chains. Thestagnation of the astral light would be the death of the human species, and thecurrent torpor of this secret agent has already manifested itself throughterrifying symptoms of decomposition and death. Cholera morbus, for example, andthe sicknesses found in potatoes and grapes, have no other cause, as was seen bythe two shepherd children of La Salette in their obscure and symbolicdaydreams.195 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__5.xhtml]Their story was met with unexpected faith, and the immense confluence ofpilgrims caused by the very singular and vague story of these two illiteratechildren with almost no morals is proof of the magnetic reality of theoccurrence and of the fluidic tendency of the Earth itself to work towardshealing its inhabitants.Superstitions are instinctive, and all that is instinct has a reason forexisting in the nature of things itself: that is what the skeptics from all theages have not properly considered.Thus we attribute all these strange occurrences of moving tables to theuniversal magnetic agent, which is looking for a chain of enthusiasm in order toform new currents. On its own, it is a blind force, but which can be directed bythe will of men and which is influenced by contemporary opinion. This universalfluid, if we wish to call it a fluid, being the common environment of allnervous organisms and the vehicle for all sensitive vibrations, establishesbetween impressionable persons a veritable physical solidarity and transmitsfrom individuals to other individuals impressions from the imagination andthought. The movement of an inert object, determined by the undulations of theuniversal agent, thus obeys the dominant impression and thereafter reproduces inits revelations all the lucidity of the most marvelous of daydreams or all thestrangeness and all the lies of the most incoherent and vaguest of dreams. Theknocking sounds arising from furniture, the noises of agitated cookware, musicalinstruments playing on their own,196 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__6.xhtml] all ofthese are illusions produced by the same cause. The convulsive miracles ofSaint-Médard197 [9781101992746_EPUB-17__7.xhtml] were of the same order andoften seemed to defy the laws of nature. On one hand, exaggerations produced byfascination resulting from intoxication due to the congestion of the astrallight; and, on the other hand, oscillations or actual movements imprinted oninert matter by the subtle and universal agent of the movement of life: this iswhat is at the foundation of all these marvelous occurrences, as we can easilyconvince ourselves of by reproducing the most impressive of these miracles atwill, by means indicated in the Ritual, and by observing the evident absence oftrickery, hallucination, or error.It has happened several times to me, after experimenting with the magical chainwith persons of good faith who were not sympathetic to my beliefs, that I wassuddenly awakened during the night, by images and truly terrifyingcommunications. One night, among others, I truly felt as if a hand wasstrangling me; I woke up, lit my lamp, and began to calmly work, making use ofmy insomnia to chase away the ghosts of sleep, when various books besides mebegan to move noisily, their pages trembling and rubbing against one another,the wood paneling crackled as though it were about to split, and dull knockingsounds came from the ceiling. I observed these effects, which were no lessimpressive even if they were caused solely by my imagination, with calmcuriosity. Incidentally, besides not being afraid at all, I was not at alloccupied with occult matters at the time they occurred.It was in reaction to such occurrences that I was led to attempt experiments inevocation with the aid of the ceremonial magic of the ancients, and from which Iobtained truly extraordinary results that I shall describe in chapter 13 of thiswork."},{"pageContent":"12 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-18_vector-1.jpg] M.THE GREAT WORKDISCITE.CRUX.198 [9781101992746_EPUB-18_fn.xhtml]The Great Work is, above all else, the creation of man by himself, that is tosay the full and entire conquest of his faculties and his future; it is aboveall the perfect emancipation of his will, which assures him the universal empireof Azoth and the domain of Magnesia, which means full control over the universalmagical agent.This magical agent, which the ancient hermetic philosophers disguised under thename of the first matter, determines the forms of the modifiable substance, andthrough its use we can actually arrive at metallic transmutation and theuniversal medicine. This is not just hypothesis, it is previously tested andrigorously demonstrable scientific fact.Nicolas Flamel199 [9781101992746_EPUB-18__1.xhtml] and Raymond Lully,200[9781101992746_EPUB-18__2.xhtml] both poor men, evidently gave away immenseriches. Agrippa only got to the first part of the Great Work, and he died in theattempt, struggling for sole possession of himself and to fix his independence.There are two hermetic operations: one which is spiritual, the other material,and these two depend upon each other.All hermetic science is contained in the doctrine that Hermes originallyengraved, or so it is said, on a tablet of emerald. We have already describedthe first articles; here are those which have to do with the Great Work:You shall separate earth from fire, the subtle from the coarse, carefully, andwith much labor.It ascends from the earth to heaven, then descends again to earth, and receivesthe power of the superiors and the inferiors.Thus you shall have the glory of the entire world, and all obscurity shall fleebefore you.It is the strong fortitude of all fortitudes, vanquishing every subtle andpenetrating every solid thing.Thus the world was created.To separate the subtle from the coarse, in the first operation, which isentirely done from within, is to liberate one’s soul from all prejudice andvice: which is done with the use of the philosophical salt, that is to saywisdom; and with mercury, that is to say, with one’s own skill and work; andfinally with sulfur, which represents the vital energy and the heat of the will.By these means we are able to transform less precious things, even the filth ofthe earth, into spiritual gold. It is in this manner that one must understandthe unwashed parables of the philosophers, of Bernard Trevisan,201[9781101992746_EPUB-18__3.xhtml] of Basilius Valentinius,202[9781101992746_EPUB-18__4.xhtml] of Mary the Egyptian,203[9781101992746_EPUB-18__5.xhtml] and other prophets of alchemy, but in theirworks, as in the Great Work, one must carefully separate the subtle from thecoarse, the mystic from the positive, the allegory from the theory. If we wishto read them with pleasure and intelligence, one must first understand thementirely allegorically, and then descend from the allegories to reality by thepath of correspondences, or analogies, indicated in the unique doctrine:That which is above is like that which is below, and vice versa.The word ART backwards, or read in the manner of the sacred and primordialwritings, that is to say from right to left, expresses, with three initials, thedifferent degrees of the Great Work. T signifies ternary, theory, and travail;R, realization; A, adaptation. We shall provide, in chapter 12 of the Ritual,the recipes of the great masters for adaptation, and in particular the onecontained in the hermetic fortress of Heinrich Khunrath.We indicate here for our readers for the purposes of research the admirabletreatise attributed to Hermes Trismegistus entitled Minerva Mundi.204[9781101992746_EPUB-18__6.xhtml] This treatise is found in only a fewpublications of Hermes’s, and contains, in the form of allegories, with muchpoetry and profundity, the doctrine of the creation of beings by and ofthemselves, or the law of creation which results from the accordance of twoforces, the forces the alchemists call the fixed and the volatile, and whichare, in the absolute, necessity and liberty. Therein is explained the diversityof forms spread throughout nature by the diversity of spirits, and themonstrosities of nature by the divergence of efforts. The reading of andmeditation upon this work is indispensable to all adepts who wish to deepentheir understanding of the mysteries of nature and to begin to work moreseriously towards the achievement of the Great Work.When the masters of alchemy said that one needs little time or money toaccomplish the great works of science, when they affirm moreover that only asingle vessel is required, when they speak of the great and unique athanor whichanyone can put to use, and which is available to everyone and that men possessit without knowing, they are alluding to philosophical and moral alchemy. Infact, a strong and decided will can arrive at absolute independence ratherquickly, and we posses the chemical instrument, the great and unique athanor,which serves to separate the subtle from the coarse and the fixed from thevolatile. This instrument, as complete as the world itself, and as precise asmathematics, and that is designated by the sages with the symbol of thepentagram or the five-pointed star, which is the absolute sign of humanintelligence. I shall imitate the sages by not naming it: it is very easy toguess it.The Tarot drawing which corresponds to this chapter was poorly understood byCourt de Gébelin and Etteilla, who believed that all they saw was an errorcommitted by a German card maker. This drawing represents a man, his hands tiedbehind his back, with two money bags attached to his armpits, hanging by onefoot from a gallows made of two tree trunks which each have six cut branches anda crossbeam that completes the letter Tav in the Jewish alphabet[image/9781101992746_EPUB-18_vector-2.jpg]; the legs of the figure are crossedand his elbows form a triangle with his head. Whereas the triangle with a crossmounted on it signifies, in alchemy, the end and the perfection of the GreatWork, the letter [image/9781101992746_EPUB-18_vector-3.jpg], which is the lastletter of the sacred alphabet, has an identical meaning.This hanged man is thus the adept, tied by his spiritual commitments,spiritualized where his feet are turned towards heaven; he is also thePrometheus of antiquity, punished with immortal torture for his glorious theft.Crudely speaking, he is the traitor Judas, and his torment threatens therevealers of the great arcanum. Finally, for the Jewish Cabalists, this hangedman, which corresponds to their twelfth dogma, that of the promised Messiah, isa protest against the Savior recognized by the Christians, and which seems tostill say to him: How will you save others, you who could not manage to saveyourself?In the Sefer Toledot Yeshu, an anti-Christian rabbinical compilation, we find asingular parable: Yeshu, says the rabbinic author of the legend, was travelingwith Simon Bar-Jonah and Judas Iscariot. They arrived late and tired at anisolated house; they were very hungry and could find nothing to eat aside from avery small and thin young goose. It was too little for three people; to share itwould have meant arousing their hunger even more, rather than satisfying it.They decided to draw straws; but, because they were falling down from lack ofsleep, “Let us sleep first,” said Yeshu, “while our meal cooks; when we wake wewill tell each other our dreams, and he who had the most beautiful dream willeat the little goose all for himself.” And thus was it done. They slept and thenawoke. “I,” said Saint Peter, “I dreamed that I was the vicar of God.” “I,” saidYeshu, “that I was God himself.” “And I,” Judas responded hypocritically, “Idreamed that while sleepwalking I got up and went quietly downstairs, removedthe goose from its spit, and ate it.” After this they all went downstairs, butthe goose had in fact disappeared: Judas had dreamed while completely awake.205[9781101992746_EPUB-18__7.xhtml]This legend is a Jewish positivist protest against Christian mysticism. In fact,while the believers were having nice dreams, the exiled Israelite, the Judas ofChristian civilization, worked, sold, agitated, became rich, and made off withthe realities of our present life and was thus able to help his cult, which hadbeen proscribed for so long. The ancients worshiped the Ark, and those whostayed faithful to the cult of the strongbox, now have the Market for a temple,and it is from there that they govern the Christian world. Judas can, in fact,laugh and congratulate himself for not having slept like Saint Peter.In the ancient precaptivity writings, the Hebrew Tav had the shape of a cross,which also confirms our interpretation of the twelfth card of the Cabalistictarot. The cross, generator of the four triangles, is also the sacred symbol ofthe duodenary, and the Egyptians called it, for that reason, the key to heaven.Also Etteilla, troubled by his long search to conciliate the analogicalnecessities of the drawing with his own personal opinion (in this he had beeninfluenced by the scholar Court de Gébelin), placed in the hand of his hangedman the hermetic caduceus formed by two serpents and a Greek Tav and then stoodhim upright and called him Prudence. Since he understood the necessity of theTav or the cross on the twelfth page of the book of Thoth, he should haveunderstood the multiple and magnificent symbol of the hermetic hanged man, thePrometheus of science, the living man who does not touch the ground except withhis thought and whose foundation is in heaven, the free and sacrificed adept,the revealer threatened with death, Judaism’s polemic against Christ, whichseems to be an involuntary admission of the occult divinity of the crucified,the sign of the work accomplished, the termination of the cycle, theintermediary Tav, which summarizes, for a first time before the last denary, thesigns of the sacred alphabet."},{"pageContent":"13 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-19_vector-1.jpg] N.NECROMANCYEX IPSIS.MORS.206 [9781101992746_EPUB-19_fn.xhtml]We have said that within the astral light are conserved the images of people andthings. It is also in this light that we can evoke the forms of those who are nolonger of this world, and it is by this means that are accomplished suchmysteries, as disputed as they are real, like necromancy.The Cabalists who spoke of the world of the spirits were simply recounting whatthey had seen in their evocations.Eliphas Lévi Zahed,207 [9781101992746_EPUB-19__1.xhtml] who writes this book,has evoked, and he has seen.Let us first say what the masters wrote of their visions or of their intuitionsin what they called the light of glory.We read in the Hebrew book of the Revolution of Souls that there are three typesof souls: the daughters of Adam, the daughters of angels, and the daughters ofsin. There are also, according to the same book, three types of spirits: captivespirits, errant spirits, and free spirits. Souls are sent off in couples. Thereare, however, male souls born widowed, and whose wives are being held captive byLilith and Na’amah, the queens of the stryges: they are souls who must expiatetheir rashness through a vow of celibacy. Thus when a man renounces from earlychildhood his love for women, he renders the wife who was destined for him aslave to the demons of debauchery. Souls meet and multiply in heaven as well asin bodies on earth. Immaculate souls are the daughters of the kisses of angels.Nothing can enter heaven which does not come from heaven. After death, then, thedivine spirit which animated a man returns alone to heaven, and leaves on earthand in the atmosphere two cadavers: one terrestrial and elementary, and anotheraerial and astral; one is already inert, the other is still animated by theuniversal movement of the world soul but is destined to slowly die, absorbed bythe astral powers which produced it. The terrestrial corpse remains visible; theother is invisible to the eyes of terrestrial and living bodies and can only beseen through applications of the astral light upon the translucent, whichcommunicates its impressions to the nervous system and thus affects the organ ofsight to the point of being able to see the forms which are conserved and thewords which are written in the book of the vital light.After a time, a man’s astral corpse evaporates like pure incense by risingtowards the upper regions, but if that man lived in crime, his astral corpse,which holds him prisoner, continues to search for the objects of his passion andwishes to live again. He torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in thevapors of spilt blood, and loiters around places where the pleasures of lifehave flowed; he still watches over the treasures he had possessed and hoarded;he exhausts himself with painful efforts, in order to make himself materialorgans so as to live again. But the celestial bodies suck him up and drink him;they feel his intellect weaken, his memory slowly fading, his entire beingdissolving. . . . His old vices appear to him as monstrous figures and chasehim; they attack and devour him. . . . The poor devil thus gradually loses allthe members of his body which had served him in his iniquity; and then he diesfor a second time and forever, because he then loses his personality and hismemory. Souls which must live but are not yet entirely purified stay captive intheir astral corpse for more or less time, where they are burnt by the odiclight which wishes to assimilate and dissolve him. It is in order to escapetheir astral corpse that souls sometimes enter into the living, and live withinthem in a state Cabalists call embryonate.It is these aerial corpses which we evoke through necromancy. It is the larvae,of dead or dying substances, that we contact; ordinarily they cannot communicateexcept through the ringing in our ears produced by the nervous trembling which Ihave spoken of, and they are normally understood only by reflecting upon ourthoughts or our dreams.But to see these strange forms one must enter into an exceptional state, betweensleep and death, which is to say that one must magnetize oneself and reach asort of lucid and alert hypnotic state. Necromancy obtains real results, andmagical evocations can produce actual visions. We have said that within thegreat magical agent, which is the astral light, are conserved the imprint of allthings, all images which have been formed either by rays or by reflections; itis within this light that our dreams appear, it is this light which intoxicatesmadmen and pulls their sleepy judgment into chasing the most bizarre ghosts. Tosee without illusions in this light, one must push aside the reflections with apowerful will and only attract the rays to oneself. To dream awake, is to seewithin the astral light; the orgies of the Sabbath, as recounted by so manywitches during their criminal trials, had appeared to them in the same manner.Often the preparations and the substances used to arrive at this result werehorrific, as we shall see in Ritual; but the results were never in doubt. Theysaw, they heard, they touched the most abominable things, the most fantastic,the most impossible. We shall return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter;here we are solely concerned with the evocation of the dead.In the spring of the year 1854, I went to London to escape my personal sorrowsand dedicate myself, without distraction, to science. I had letters ofintroduction to eminent people who were curious about revelations from thesupernatural world. I saw several of them, and I found in them, along with theirvery courteous behavior, a foundation based on indifference or frivolity. Theyasked of me before anything else for miracles as though they were addressing acharlatan. I was a bit discouraged because, to tell the truth, far from beingdisposed to initiating others into the mysteries of ceremonial magic, I wasalways afraid of, for myself, the illusions and the fatigue; incidentally, theseceremonies require expensive materials which are difficult to find. Thus Iisolated myself in the study of the high Cabala, and I no longer thought ofEnglish adepts, when one day, upon returning to my hotel, I found an envelopeaddressed to me. This envelope contained half of a card which was cut crosswise,and upon which I first recognized the symbol of the seal of Solomon and also avery small piece of paper upon which had been written in pencil: “Tomorrow, atthree o’clock, in front of Westminster Abbey, we shall present you with theother half of this card.” I went to this very singular rendezvous. A carriagewas parked there. I held, without affectation, my piece of the card in my hand;a servant approached me and waved to me while opening the door to the car. Inthe car was a woman dressed in black, whose hat was covered with a very thickveil; she indicated that I should climb in beside her, while showing me theother half of the card I had received. The door closed, the car began to move,and, the woman having lifted up her veil, I could now see that I was dealingwith an older person who had gray eyebrows and black eyes which were extremelybright and strangely fixed. “Sir,” she said to me, with a very heavy Englishaccent, “I know that the law of secrecy is very strict among adepts; a friend ofSir B*** L***,208 [9781101992746_EPUB-19__2.xhtml] whom you met, knows that youwere asked to perform certain experiments, and that you refused to satisfy theircuriosity. Perhaps you do not have the necessary equipment: I wish to assemble acomplete magical study for you; but I ask of you, before all else, completesecrecy. If you do not swear upon your honor, I will give the order for you tobe driven back to your hotel.” I made the promise asked of me, and I am stillfaithful to it by mentioning neither the name, nor station, nor the abode ofthis lady, who I soon accepted as an initiate, not precisely of the first order,but of a very high rank. We had several long conversations, during which shealways insisted on practical experience in order to complete the initiation. Sheshowed me a collection of clothes and magical instruments, she even lent me someinteresting books which I did not have; in short, she convinced me to attemptthe experiment of a complete evocation at her place, which I prepared for duringtwenty-one days by strictly observing the practices described in the thirteenthchapter of the Ritual.All was ready by the 24th of July, it concerned the evocation of the divineghost of Apollonius, and I was to ask him about two secrets: one which concernedme, and one which the lady was interested in. She had at first planned on beingpresent for the evocation with another person she trusted; but at the lastmoment that person took fright, and since the ternary or the unity is strictlyrequired for these magical rites, I was left to conduct it alone. The studywhich had been prepared for the evocation was in a small tower: inside it we hadplaced four concave mirrors and a sort of altar whose base was made of whitemarble encircled by a magnetized iron chain. Upon the white marble was engravedin gold the sign of the pentagram, as it is shown here[9781101992746_EPUB-11.xhtml#pageMap_73]; and the same sign was drawn, invarious colors, on the new and white lambskin which had been laid under thealtar. In the middle of the marble table there was a small copper brazier withalder and bay wood charcoal; another brazier was placed before me on a tripod. Iwas dressed in robes like that of our Catholic priests, but that they were moreample and longer, and on my head I wore a crown of vervain leaves intertwinedwith a golden chain. In one hand I held a new sword and in the other the Ritual.I lit the two braziers with the required and prepared substances, and I beganreciting, in a low voice at first, then raising my voice by degrees, theinvocations from the Ritual. The smoke expanded, the flames made all the objectswhich they illuminated shimmer, and then they went out. The white smoke slowlyrose above the marble altar. I seemed to feel the earth tremble; my ears wereringing and my heart beat strongly. I put several branches and perfume in thebraziers, and as the flames rose again, I distinctly saw, in front of the altar,the larger-than-life figure of a man, which then dissipated and faded away. Irenewed my evocations, and I had just placed myself within the circle I haddrawn beforehand between the altar and the tripod: it was then that I saw appearwithin the mirror in front of me, behind the altar, a white form, getting largerand appearing to draw nearer. I closed my eyes and called out to Apolloniusthree times; and when I opened them again, a man stood before me, entirelycovered in some kind of shroud, who seemed to me to be more gray than white; hisform was thin, sad, and beardless, which was not exactly the image I had ofApollonius beforehand. I felt an extraordinarily cold sensation, and when Iopened my mouth to question the ghost, I was unable to utter a sound. I then putmy hand upon the sign of the pentagram, and I directed the point of my swordtowards him, commanding him mentally, by that sign, to stop trying to frightenme and to obey me. Then the form became more confused and suddenly disappeared.I commanded him to return: I then felt a kind of breath pass near me, andsomething touched my hand which held the sword, and I immediately felt my armbecome numb right up to my shoulder. From this I hypothesized that the swordoffended the spirit, and I drove the point of the sword into the circlesurrounding me. The human figure reappeared right afterwards, but I felt such agreat weakness in my limbs, and such a sudden failing which overtook me that Itook two steps back to sit down. The moment I sat down, I fell into a deeplethargy accompanied by dreams, of which there only remained vague and confusedmemories once I reawakened. For several days afterwards, my arm remained numband painful. The figure never spoke to me, but it seemed to me that thequestions I had had for him had been answered for me in my mind. To the lady’squestion, an interior voice answered within me: Dead! (The question was withregard to a man which the lady wished to have news of.) As for me, I wished toknow if reunification and forgiveness was possible between two people I wasthinking about, and the same interior echo replied mercilessly: Dead!I relate here the events as they happened, I do not insist that anyone believeme. The effect of this experience on me was inexplicable. I was no longer thesame man, something from another world had passed within me; I was no longereither cheerful, or sad, but I felt a singular attraction to death, withoutbeing, however, at all tempted to commit suicide. I carefully analyzed what Ihad gone through; and, despite a very strong feeling of nervous repugnance, Itwice repeated, at a few days interval, the same experience. The story of whathappened during my subsequent trials does not differ enough from the firstexperience for me to need to add to this already perhaps too long narrative. Butthe result of the two other evocations was the revelation of two Cabalisticsecrets, which could, if they were known to the world, quickly transform thefoundations and the laws of our entire society.Should I conclude from all this that I actually evoked, saw, and touched thegreat Apollonius of Tyana? I am not enough of a crackpot to believe so, nor soirresponsible as to confirm it. The effect of the preparations, the perfumes,the mirrors, the pentacles was a veritable intoxication of the imagination,which must have acted strongly upon an already impressionable and nervousperson. I cannot explain by what physiological laws I saw and touched; I onlyconfirm that I saw and that I touched, that I saw clearly and distinctly,without dreaming, and that suffices in order to believe in the genuine efficacyof magical ceremonies. I also believe the practice to be dangerous and harmful;one’s health, both moral and physical, would not withstand such exercises ifthey were to become habitual. The older lady of whom I spoke, and who has sincecaused me some trouble, is the proof of this: because, despite her denials, Ihave no doubt that she often makes use of goetia and necromancy. She at timescompletely lost her reason, at other times, she became senselessly angry withoutbeing able to explain why. I left London without seeing her again, and I willfaithfully keep the promise I made to say nothing to anyone which might revealher identity or even raise suspicions about her practices, which I am sure sheconducts without the knowledge of her family, which is, or so I understand,relatively numerous and of a high social position.There are evocations of intelligence, evocations of love, and evocations ofhate; but nothing proves, once again, that the spirits actually leave the upperspheres to meet with us, and the contrary is more probable. We evoke thememories which they have left in the astral light, which is the common reservoirof universal magnetism. It is in this light that in the past the emperor Juliansaw the Gods as old, sick, and decrepit: another proof of the influence ofcurrent and accepted opinion on the reflections of this same magical agent,which makes tables speak and gives answers by knocking on walls. After theevocation of which I just spoke about, I carefully reread the life ofApollonius, who historians have described as an ideal of old-world beauty andelegance. I remarked that Apollonius, towards the end of his life, was shavenand tortured for a long time in prison. Those circumstances, which I no doubtretained from a previous reading, without remembering it, may have contributedto the unattractive appearance of my vision, which I consider solely as avoluntary waking dream. I saw two other persons, whom there is no need to name,and both were different, by their costume and their aspect, from what I expectedto see. I recommend, by the way, the greatest prudence to any who wish toattempt the same type of experiments: there results from them great fatigue andoften even distresses abnormal enough to cause sickness.I shall not end this chapter without mentioning here the rather strange opinionof certain Cabalists who distinguish apparent death from true death, and whobelieve that they rarely coincide. According to them, most people who are buriedare still alive, and many others who we believe to be alive are actually dead.Incurable madness, for example, would be for them an incomplete death, but areal one, which leaves the terrestrial body under the purely instinctive controlof the astral body. When the human soul suffers a violence which it cannot copewith, it then separates from its body, and leaves in its place the animal orastral soul, which makes of the human remains something which is less alive in away than an animal. We recognize, they say, deaths of this type by the completeextinction of the affectionate and moral senses; they are not bad, they are notgood: they are dead. These beings, who are the poisonous mushrooms of the humanspecies, absorb as much life as they can from the living; that is why theirapproach numbs the soul and makes the heart cold.These cadaverous beings, if they existed, would do all the things we onceattributed to revenants and vampires.Are there not beings beside whom we feel less intelligent, less good, sometimeseven less honest?Are there not beings whose approach extinguishes all belief and all enthusiasm,and who tie you to them through your weaknesses, dominate you through your badtendencies, and who slowly kill your morals, in a torment similar to that ofMezentius?209 [9781101992746_EPUB-19__3.xhtml]They are the dead, who we take to be living; they are vampires, whom we take tobe friends!"},{"pageContent":"14 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-20_vector-1.jpg] O.TRANSMUTATIONSSPHERA LUNAE.SEMPITERNUM.AUXILIUM.210 [9781101992746_EPUB-20_fn.xhtml]Saint Augustine seriously doubted that Apuleius could have been changed into anass by a witch from Thessaly.211 [9781101992746_EPUB-20__5.xhtml] Thetheologians argued at length regarding the transmutation of Nebuchadnezzar intoa wild animal.212 [9781101992746_EPUB-20__6.xhtml] This simply proves that theeloquent doctor of Hippo was unaware of the magical arcanum, and that thetheologians in question were not very advanced in exegesis. We will examine, inthis chapter, marvels which are even more incredible yet incontestable. I wishto speak of lycanthropy, or the nocturnal transformation of men into wolves,well known around campfires in our countryside, due to all the stories toldabout werewolves: stories so well documented, that, in order to explain them,incredulous science has had to resort to claims of mass delusions and hoaxes.But such hypotheses are puerile and explain nothing. Let us look elsewhere forthe secret to the observed phenomena regarding this subject and note to startwith: 1. That no one has ever been killed by a werewolf, except through suffocation, with no blood being spilt and no wounds. 2. That werewolves who were hunted down, chased, even wounded, were never killed on the spot. 3. That persons suspected of these transformations were always found in their homes after the hunt for a werewolf, sometimes about to die but always in their natural form.Now let us observe certain phenomena of another order.Nothing is more attested to and incontestably proven than the visible and realpresence of Father Alphonsus de Liguori besides the dying Pope, while at thesame time he was observed at home, at a great distance from Rome, in prayer andecstasy.The simultaneous presence of the missionary Francis Xavier in several places atonce has also been just as rigorously observed.213[9781101992746_EPUB-20__7.xhtml]One might say that they are miracles; I would answer that miracles, when theyare real, are simply phenomena to be studied by science.The apparition of persons who are dear to us coinciding with the moment of theirdeath are phenomena of the same order and attributable to the same cause.We have spoken about the astral body, which is the intermediary between the souland the physical body. This body often remains aware while the physical bodysleeps, and travels by thought within all the space open to it through universalmagnetism. It thus stretches the sympathetic chain which keeps it attached toour hearts and brains without breaking it, and this is what makes awakening witha start so dangerous to people who are dreaming. In fact, an overly loud noisecan abruptly break the chain, causing sudden death.The form which our astral body takes on conforms to the habitual state of ourthoughts, and it modifies, over time, the traits of the material body. It is forthis reason that Swedenborg, during his hypnotic visions, often saw spirits inthe form of diverse animals.We now dare to say that a werewolf is nothing but the astral body of a man, towhom the wolf represents wild and bloodthirsty instincts, and who, while hisghost wanders about in the countryside, is sleeping restlessly in his bed whiledreaming that he is an actual wolf.What renders the werewolf visible is the almost hypnotic overexcitement causedby the fright of the people who see him, or the disposition, more common amongsimple people in the countryside, to communicate directly with the astral light,which is the common milieu of visions and dreams. The attacks on the werewolfcause actual harm to the sleeping person through odic214[9781101992746_EPUB-20__8.xhtml] and sympathetic congestion of the astral light,through the correspondence between the immaterial body and the material body. Agreat number of people might think they are dreaming when reading about suchthings and might ask us if we are in possession of our senses, but we ask thatthe men of science simply reflect upon the phenomena surrounding pregnancy andthe influence of a woman’s imagination upon the form of their offspring. A womanwho has witnessed the suffering of a man who was severely beaten will give birthto a child whose limbs have all been broken.215 [9781101992746_EPUB-20__9.xhtml]Please explain how the impression made upon the soul of the mother by a horriblespectacle can harm and break the limbs of her infant, and we shall explain howattacks made and received in dreams can actually break and even seriously woundthe body who receives them in the imagination, especially when their body issuffering and under nervous and magnetic influences.It is these phenomena and the occult laws which produce them that are related tothe effects of enchantments, which we shall speak of later. Diabolic obsessions,and most nervous sicknesses that affect the brain, are wounds caused to thenervous system due to a perverted astral light, that is to say one that isabsorbed or projected in abnormal proportions. All extraordinary andextranatural tensions of the will dispose one to obsessions and nervoussicknesses; forced celibacy, asceticism, hatred, ambition, unrequited love, areall the principal generators of infernal forms and influences. Paracelsus saysthat the menstrual blood of women engenders phantoms in the air; a convent, fromthis point of view, would be a seminary of nightmares, and we could compare itto those demons with heads like the Lernaean hydra,216[9781101992746_EPUB-20_10.xhtml] which were reborn without end and multipliedthrough the blood from their wounds.The phenomena related to the possession of the Ursulines of Loudun, so fatal toUrbain Grandier, were misunderstood. The nuns were actually possessed due tohysteria and a fanatical imitation of the secret thoughts of their exorcists,transmitted to their nervous system via the astral light. They received theimpressions of all the hatred that this unfortunate priest had inspired, andthis entirely internal communication appeared to them as diabolical andmiraculous. Thus in this unfortunate affair everyone was of good faith, evenLaubardement,217 [9781101992746_EPUB-20_11.xhtml] who, in blindly executing thebiased sentences of Cardinal Richelieu, believed that he was fulfilling theduties of a true judge and did not at all suspect himself of being a servant toPontius Pilate, such that it was impossible for him to see the priest ofSaint-Pierre-du-Marché, who was a strong and free-thinking spirit, as a discipleof Christ and a martyr.The possession of the nuns of Louviers is barely more than a copy of that ofLoudun: demons are not very inventive and often plagiarize each other. The trialof Gaufridi and of Madeleine de la Palud are of a much stranger aspect. Here thevictims accuse themselves. Gaufridi admits to being guilty of removing fromseveral women, by a simple breath up their nostrils, their freedom to defendthemselves against seduction. One young and beautiful girl, of noble family,breathed upon by him, recounts, in the greatest of details, scenes of the mostmonstrous and grotesque lechery. Such are the ordinary hallucinations of falsemysticism and poorly preserved celibacy. Gaufridi and his mistress were obsessedby their reciprocal chimeras, and in the head of one were reflected thenightmares of the other. Did not the Marquis de Sade himself attract certainsick and retarded characters?The scandalous trial of Father Girard is recent proof of the delirium ofmysticism and the singular neuralgia which can follow in its wake. Theconvulsions of Cadière, her ecstasies, her stigmata—all of it was as real as themad debauchery which was perhaps involuntary on the part of her director. Sheaccused him once he wished to take leave of her, and the conversion of this girlwas a form of vengeance, because nothing is more cruel than depraved love. Thepowerful person218 [9781101992746_EPUB-20_12.xhtml] who had intervened inGrandier’s trial in order to defeat a possible sectarian, saved Father Girard inthe name of the honor of the Jesuits. Grandier and Girard both arrived at thesame results by very different paths, of which we will be especially concernedwith in the sixteenth chapter.We act through our imagination upon the imagination of others, through ourastral body upon theirs, and through our organs upon their organs. In this way,through the sympathy either of attraction or of obsession, we possess oneanother, and we identify with those upon whom we wish to act. It is the reactionagainst this control that produces in the most ardent sympathies a subsequentlyeven more pronounced antipathy. Love has a tendency to identify beings; yet, inidentifying them, it often renders them rivals, and in consequence enemies, ifthe basic disposition of two characters is unsociable, as would be, for example,pride; to equally saturate two united souls with pride is to divide them byrendering them rivals. Antagonism is the necessary result of the plurality ofthe gods.When we dream about a living person, it is their astral body which presentsitself to ours in the astral light, or at least the reflection of that samebody, and the manner in which we are affected by our encounter with it oftenreveals hidden dispositions that this person holds with regard to us. Love, forexample, creates the astral body of one in the image and resemblance of theother, such that woman’s animus219 [9781101992746_EPUB-20__1.xhtml] is like aman and man’s anima is like a woman. It is this exchange that the Cabalistswished to express in an occult manner when they said, in explaining an obscureterm in Genesis: “God created love by placing one of Adam’s ribs in the breastof Eve and some of Eve’s flesh in the breast of Adam, such that at the bottom ofthe heart of woman is a man’s bone and at the bottom of the heart of man is theflesh of woman,” an allegory that is certainly not without profundity andbeauty.In the preceding chapter we mentioned a concept that the masters of the Cabalacalled the embryonate of souls. This embryonate, which is completed after thedeath of the person who has possessed someone else, is often started while thatperson is still living, either through obsession or through love. I knew a youngwoman whose parents inspired great fear in her, and who out of the blueperpetrated the acts upon an inoffensive person that she had feared her parentswould do to her. I knew another who, after having taken part in the evocation ofa guilty woman tormented in the other world for eccentric acts, began to imitatewithout reason the acts of the dead woman. It is to this occult power that onemust attribute the redoubtable influence of the curse of one’s parents,redoubtable to all the peoples of the Earth, and the real danger of magicaloperations when one has not managed to isolate oneself as the true adepts do.This aspect of astral transmutation, which really exists in love, explains theallegorical miracles of the wand of Circe. Apuleius speaks of a Thessalonian whocould transform into a bird; he got the servant of this woman to fall in lovewith him so he could learn the secrets of her mistress, and only managed to gettransformed into an ass.220 [9781101992746_EPUB-20__2.xhtml] The allegoryexplains the most hidden secrets of love. The Cabalists still say that when welove an elementary woman, whether she be an undine or a sylph or a gnomide,221[9781101992746_EPUB-20__3.xhtml] we immortalize her within us or we die withher. We have seen that elementary beings are imperfect and still mortal humans.The revelation of which we speak, and which we saw as a myth, is thus thedoctrine of moral solidarity in love, which is the basis of love itself and isthe only explanation for all holiness and all power.Who, then, is this female magician who changes her adorers into swine and whoseenchantments are destroyed the moment she falls in love? It is the courtesan ofold, the girl of marble of all the eras. The loveless woman absorbs and debasesall that approaches her; the woman who loves spreads enthusiasm, greatness, andlife.We have spoken a great deal of an adept of the last century who was accused ofcharlatanism, and who in his lifetime was named the divine Cagliostro. We knowthat he conducted evocations and that he was surpassed in his art only by thevisionary SchrÖpfer.222 [9781101992746_EPUB-20__4.xhtml] We know that he boastedof binding sympathies, and that he said that he knew the secret of the GreatWork; but what made him even more famous was a certain elixir of life whichinstantly gave vigor and the sap of youth to old men. This mixture had for itsbase Malvasian wine, and was obtained by the distillation of the sperm ofcertain animals with the juice of several plants.

We shall face, within itsveritable sanctuary, the black god of the Sabbath, the formidable goat ofMendes. Here, those who are fearful should close this book, and persons subjectto nervous reactions would do well to distract themselves or abstain; but wehave imposed a task upon ourselves, and we shall finish it.Let us begin by dealing with the subject in a frank and bold manner:Does the devil exist?What is the devil?Regarding the first question, science is silent; philosophy denies his existenceindiscriminately, and only religion responds in the affirmative.Regarding the second question, religion claims that the devil is a fallen angel;occult philosophy accepts this and explains this definition.We shall not repeat what we have already said, but we shall add here a newrevelation:THE DEVIL, IN BLACK MAGIC, IS THE GREAT MAGICAL AGENT USED FOR PURPOSES OF EVILBY A PERVERSE WILL.The ancient serpent of legend is nothing other than the universal agent, it isthe eternal fire of terrestrial life; it is the soul of the Earth and the livinghearth of hell.We have said that the astral light is the receptacle of forms. Evoked throughreason, these forms are produced in harmony; evoked through madness, they turnup disordered and monstrous: such is the cradle of nightmares of Saint Anthonyand the phantoms of the Sabbath.Do the evocations of goetia and demonomania give results? Yes, most certainly,incontestable results which are more terrible than those recounted in legends!When we call upon the devil with the required ceremonies, the devil comes and wesee him.In order not to die, struck down by this vision, in order not to becomecataleptic or insane, one must already be crazy.Grandier was a libertine through impiety, and perhaps also through skepticism;Girard was corrupt and a corrupter through enthusiasm, due to his asceticturmoils and the blindness of his faith.We shall provide, in the fifteenth chapter of our Ritual, all the diabolicalevocations and practices of black magic, not so as to make use of them, but sothat we know them, judge them, and so that we can protect ourselves forevermorefrom such aberrations.M. Eudes de Mirville,224 [9781101992746_EPUB-21__1.xhtml] whose books on tableturning recently created a buzz, will be both happy and unhappy with thesolution we provide here regarding the question of black magic. Indeed, weaccept, as he does, the reality and magnificence of the effects, we also assignto them the same cause as he does; the ancient serpent, the prince of the occultof this world; but we are not in agreement as to the nature of this blind agent,which is at the same time, but under different managers, the instrument of allgood and of all evil, the servant of the prophets and the inspirer of thepythonesses.225 [9781101992746_EPUB-21__2.xhtml] In a word, the devil, for us,is the power used for a period of time in the service of error, just as mortalsin is, in our eyes, the persistence of the will in absurdity. M. de Mirville isthus right a thousand times, but he is wrong, very wrong, in a single instance.What one must exclude from the kingdom of beings is the arbitrary. Nothingoccurs either by accident or by the autocracy of a good or bad will. There aretwo chambers in heaven, and the deviations of Satan’s tribunal are restrained bythe senate of divine wisdom."},{"pageContent":"16 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-22_vector-1.jpg] Q.ENCHANTMENTSFONS.OCULUS.FULGUR.226 [9781101992746_EPUB-22_fn.xhtml]A man who looks upon woman with impure desire profanes that woman, said thegreat Master.227 [9781101992746_EPUB-22__6.xhtml] What we wish for withdedication, we actually do. All true will is confirmed by acts; all willconfirmed by an act is an action. All action is subject to judgment, and thatjudgment is eternal. These are the doctrines and principles.According to these principles and these doctrines, the good or evil that youwish, either upon yourself or upon others, to the extent of your will and withinthe sphere of your action, will infallibly occur, either to others or toyourself, if you confirm your will and settle upon your determination throughacts.The acts must be analogous to the will. The will to harm or to be loved must beconfirmed, to be efficacious, by acts of hate or love.All that which carries the imprint of a human soul belongs to that soul; allthat which a man appropriates in any manner becomes his body, in the largestsense of the word, and that which is done to the body of a man is felt, eitherindirectly or directly, through his soul.It is for this reason that every type of hostile action towards another isregarded by moral theology as the beginning of a homicide.Enchantment228 [9781101992746_EPUB-22__7.xhtml] is homicide, and it is ahomicide that is all the more cowardly since it eludes the right to defense ofthe victim and the vengeance of the law.This principle being established, to the satisfaction of our conscience and inorder to warn off the weak, we affirm fearlessly that enchantment is possible.Let us go further and affirm that not only is it possible, but in a certain waynecessary and inevitable. It occurs ceaselessly in the social world, unbeknownstto both those who perform it and those who suffer from it. Involuntaryenchantment is one of the most terrible dangers of human life.The sympathy of the passions necessarily submits the most ardent desire to thestrongest will. Moral sicknesses are more contagious than physical ones, andthere are fads and fashions whose success is comparable to leprosy or cholera.We can die from a bad acquaintance as if it were a contagious contact, and thehorrible malady that, during the last few centuries, in Europe, has punished theprofanation of the mysteries of love,229 [9781101992746_EPUB-22__8.xhtml] is arevelation of the analogical laws of nature, and represents only a weakenedimage of the moral corruption which results every day from dubious sympathies.Rumor speaks of a jealous and cowardly man who, to avenge himself upon a rival,voluntarily infected himself with an incurable illness, and makes of it a mutualbane and the anathema of a shared bed. This horrible story is that of everymagician, or rather every sorcerer who practices enchantment. He poisons himselfin order to poison; he damns himself in order to torture; he inhales hell toexhale it; he injures himself until death in order to kill; but if he has theunfortunate courage, it is definite and certain that he will poison and killthrough the projection of his perverse will alone.There exists loves which kill as easily as hate, and the enchantments ofbenevolence are a torture for the wicked. Prayers which we address to God in thehopes of converting a man bring misfortune upon him if he does not wish to beconverted. It is, as we have already mentioned, tiring and dangerous to fightagainst the fluidic currents excited by chains of united wills.There are thus two types of enchantments: involuntary enchantment and voluntaryenchantment. We can also distinguish between physical enchantment and moralenchantment.Strength attracts strength, life attracts life, good health attracts goodhealth: it is a law of nature.If two children live together, and especially if they sleep together, and if oneis weak and one is strong, the strong one will absorb the weak one, and the weakone will waste away. That is why it is important that children always sleepseparately.In boarding schools, certain students absorb the intelligence of other students,and in any circle of men one always finds one individual who takes hold of thewills of the others.Enchantment through currents is very common, as we have remarked previously: weare carried away by the masses, in both moral and physical senses. But what wewish to note in particular in this chapter is the almost absolute power of thehuman will in the determination of its acts and the influence of all exteriordemonstrations of will even upon exterior things.Voluntary enchantments are still common in the countryside, because the naturalforces, among ignorant and solitary people, act without being weakened by anydoubts or diversions. A frank hatred, absolute and without any mix of unrequitedpassions or personal cupidity, is the kiss of death for he who is their objectin certain given conditions. I say without any mix of amorous passion orcupidity, because a desire, being an attraction, counterbalances and annuls thepower of the projection. Thus, for example, someone who is jealous will neverefficaciously enchant his rival, and an eager heir will not decrease by his willalone the number of days left to a miserly and hardy uncle. Enchantments whichare attempted under these conditions fall back upon those who perform them andare more salutary than noxious to the person who is their object, because he isfreed from their hateful action, which destroys itself by too much enthusiasm.The French word envoûtement, so very energetic in its Gallic simplicity,admirably expresses the thing which it signifies: envoultement, which is theaction of taking, in a manner of speaking, and enveloping someone in a vow, in aformulated wish.The instrument of enchantments is none other than the great magical agentitself, which, under the influence of a malicious will, truly and positivelybecomes demonic.Properly speaking, evil spells, that is to say a ceremonial performance with theobject of enchantment, act only upon the performer, and serve to fix and confirmhis will by formulating it with perseverance and effort, the two conditionswhich render the will efficacious.The more that the performance is difficult or horrible, the more effective itis, because it acts more fully upon the imagination and attests to the effortrequired, which is in direct relationship to the sense of resistance to it.This is what explains the strangeness and even atrocity of magical performancesduring antiquity and the Middle Ages: the satanic masses, the sacramentsadministered to reptiles, the spilling of blood, the human sacrifices, and othermonstrosities which are the essence of the reality of goetia or necromancy. Itis such practices which have attracted onto sorcerers the just repression of thelaw throughout the ages. Black magic is in fact simply a combination ofsacrilege and progressive murder whose goal is to forever pervert the human willand to produce in a man the hideous phantom of the devil. It is thus, properlyspeaking, the religion of the devil, the cult of shadows, the hatred of the goodbrought to its climax; it is the incarnation of death and the permanent creationof hell.The Cabalist Bodin, who was falsely suspected of being weak minded andsuperstitious, had no other motive in writing his Demonomania than the need toguard minds against an overly dangerous incredulity. Initiated through the studyof the Cabala and the true secrets of magic, he trembled at the thought of thedangers to which society would be exposed by way of this power if it were leftin the hands of the wickedness of men. He thus attempted that which M. Eudes deMirville, who is still among us, has also just done: he gathered the factswithout explaining them, and denounced to the sciences, inattentive or elsewherepreoccupied, the existence of occult influences in the criminal performance ofbad magic. Bodin was ignored in his time and so will M. Eudes de Mirville be,because it is not enough to indicate phenomenon while presupposing the cause inorder to impress serious people; that cause must be studied, explained, andproven to exist, and that is our task here. Will we be more successful?One can die from being loved by certain beings just as much as from theirhatred: there are absorbing passions under whose influence we feel weakened likethe victims of vampires. It is not only the wicked who torment the good, butwithout knowing it the good torture the wicked. Abel’s kindness was a long andpainful enchantment for the ferocity of Cain.230[9781101992746_EPUB-22__9.xhtml] The hatred of the good among wicked men derivesfrom the instinct for survival itself; incidentally, they deny that whattorments them is the good, and endeavor, for their peace of mind, to deify andjustify evil. Abel, in the eyes of Cain, was a hypocrite and a coward whodishonored human dignity through his scandalous submissiveness to the divinity.How much must this first murderer have suffered before coming to that terribleassault upon his brother? If Abel had been able to understand him, he would havebeen terrified.Antipathy is nothing other than the presentiment of a possible enchantment, anenchantment which could be of love or of hatred, because we often see lovefollowing after antipathy. The astral light warns us of influences to come byacting upon a more or less sensitive, and more or less aware, nervous system.The instantaneous sympathies of sudden love are explosions of astral light setin motion just as exactly, and no less mathematically explainable anddemonstrable, as strong electrical discharges from batteries. We can see fromthis how many unforeseen dangers menace the profane who play unceasingly withfire near the gunpowder they do not see.We are saturated with astral light, and we project it unceasingly to make roomfor more and to attract more. The nervous apparatus destined either forattraction or for projection are in particular the eyes and the hands. Thepolarity of the hands resides in the thumb, and it is for this reason, accordingto the magical tradition still kept in our countryside, that one must, when onefinds oneself in suspect company, hold one’s thumb folded and hidden behind thehand, while refusing to stare at anyone but trying to be the first to look uponthose from whom we have something to fear, so as to avoid fluidic projectionsand mesmerizing looks.There also exist certain animals whose property is to break the currents of theastral light through an ability for absorption which is particular to them.These animals are violently antipathetic to us and have a look in their eyeswhich is mesmerizing, such as the toad, the basilisk, and the tard.231[9781101992746_EPUB-22_10.xhtml] These animals, if tamed and carried or keptalive in the rooms where we live, guarantee hallucinations and the illusions ofastral intoxication: ASTRAL INTOXICATION, a word which we write here for thefirst time, and which explains all the phenomena related to wild passions,mental elation, and madness.Go and raise toads and tards, my dear sir, a disciple of Voltaire would tell mehere; carry them around with you and write no more. To which I would respondthat I would consider that most seriously when I felt disposed to laugh at thatwhich I know nothing of, and to treat as mad those men whose science and wisdomI do not understand.Paracelsus, the greatest of Christian mages, countered enchantments byperforming contrary ones. He made up sympathetic remedies and applied them, notto the suffering limbs, but to the representations of those same limbs, formedand consecrated according to ceremonial magic. His success was phenomenal, andnever has any doctor gotten close to achieving the same success as the marvelouscures of Paracelsus.But Paracelsus had discovered magnetism well before Mesmer and had pushed to itslimits this marvelous discovery, or rather this initiation into the magic of theancients, who understood, more than us, the great magical agent, and who did notthink of the astral light, of azoth, of the universal magnesia of the sages, asa particular and animal fluid solely emanating from a few special beings.232[9781101992746_EPUB-22_11.xhtml]In his occult philosophy, Paracelsus opposes ceremonial magic, whose terriblepower he was certainly aware of but whose practices he wished to disparage, soas to discredit black magic. He places the omnipotence of the mage in theinternal and occult Magnes. The most skillful magnetizers of our day could sayno better. However, Paracelsus wants us to use the magical symbols, and moreimportantly the talismans, in order to cure maladies. We will have cause to comeback to the subject regarding Paracelsus’s talismans in our eighteenth chapter,when touching upon, according to Gaffarel, the great question of occulticonography and numismatics.233 [9781101992746_EPUB-22_12.xhtml]We can also cure an enchantment by substitution, when that is possible, andthrough the rupture or the diversion of the astral current. The customs in thecountryside are most admirable and most certainly come from afar: they are theremains of the teachings of the Druids, who had been initiated into themysteries of Egypt and India by wandering hierophants. We know then, in popularmagic, that an enchantment, which is to say a determined and confirmed will todo evil, always obtains its desired effect, and that it cannot be recantedwithout risk of death. The sorcerer who delivers someone from a charm must haveanother object for his malice, or it is certain that he himself will be struckand then die, a victim to his own evil spells. The astral movement beingcircular, all azotic or magnetic emissions which do not encounter their mediumreturn powerfully to their point of departure: which explains one of thestrangest stories from any sacred book, the tale of demons sent into pigs, whothen ran into the sea.234 [9781101992746_EPUB-22_13.xhtml] This work of highinitiation was nothing other than the rupture of an infected magnetic current byevil willpowers. “I am legion,” said the instinctive voice of the patient, “forwe are many.”235 [9781101992746_EPUB-22__1.xhtml]Demonic possessions are nothing other than enchantments, and there exist in ourtime innumerable quantities of the possessed. A saintly religious man whodevotes himself to the service of the insane, Brother Hilarion Tissot236[9781101992746_EPUB-22__2.xhtml] has managed, through long experience and theconstant practice of the Christian virtues, to cure many patients, and withoutknowing it he practices the magnetism of Paracelsus. He attributes most of thesemaladies to disorders of the will or the perverse influence of foreign wills; hesees all crime as acts of folly and would like us to treat the wicked aspatients, rather than exciting them and rendering them even more incurable underthe pretext of punishing them. How much time will pass before the poor BrotherHilarion is recognized as a man of genius! and how many serious men in readingthis chapter, will still say that Hilarion Tissot and I should treat each otheraccording to the ideas which are common to us, by not publishing our theories ifwe do not wish to be taken for doctors who should be sent to the asylum!And yet it turns! So cried Galileo, while stamping his foot on the earth.237[9781101992746_EPUB-22__3.xhtml] You shall recognize the truth, and the truthshall set you free, says the Savior of men. We might add: You will love justice,and justice will render you healthy. A vice is a poison, even for the body: truevirtue is a guarantee of longevity.The methods of ceremonial enchantment vary depending on the times and thepeople, and all men of artifice and domination find within themselves itssecrets and practices, without even calculating precisely or reasoning theirorder. They follow the instinctive inspirations of the great agent, whichassimilate marvelously, as we have already said, into our vices and virtues; butwe can say that, in general, we are under the power of the wills of othersthrough the analogy of our desires and most of all through our vices. To coddlethe weaknesses of an individual is to seize hold of him and make of him aninstrument corresponding in kind to the same errors or the same depravities. Yetwhen two analogical natures in error subordinate themselves to one another,there is created a sort of substitution of the weakest by the strongest, and averitable obsession with one mind by the other. Often the weaker one strugglesand wishes to rebel but then falls lower than ever into servitude. It was inthis way that Louis XIII conspired against Richelieu and then obtained grace ofa sort by abandoning his accomplices.238 [9781101992746_EPUB-22__4.xhtml]We all have a ruling vice which is, for our soul, like the umbilical cord of itsbirth into sin, and it is through it that the enemy can always grab hold of us:it is vanity for some, laziness for others, egoism for a great many. If acunning and wicked mind makes use of this resource, then you are lost. You thenbecome, not mad, not idiotic, but positively alienated, using the full meaningof this expression, that is to say subject to a foreign impulse. In this state,you feel instinctive horror for anything that would bring you back to reason,and you do not even want to hear representations which are contrary to yourlunacy. It is is one of the most dangerous sicknesses which can affect humanmorale.The only remedy to this enchantment is to seize upon madness in order to curemadness, and to force the patient to find imaginary satisfactions in thecontrary order to the ones to which he lost himself. Thus one can, for example,cure a power-hungry person by having him desire the glories of heaven; cure adepraved person through true love, a natural remedy; provide honorable successto a vain person; show selflessness to an avaricious person and provide themwith a just profit through the participation in a generous endeavor, and so on.By acting in this manner upon morals, we can cure a great number of physicalmaladies, because morals influence the physical by virtue of the magical axiom:“That which is above is like that which is below.” It is for this reason thatthe Master said, in speaking of a paralytic woman: Satan has bound her.239[9781101992746_EPUB-22__5.xhtml] Sickness often comes from a vice or an abuse,and you will always find at the source of a physical illness a moral disorder:it is an invariable law of nature."},{"pageContent":"17 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-23_vector-1.jpg] R.ASTROLOGYSTELLA.OS.INFLEXUS.240 [9781101992746_EPUB-23_fn.xhtml]Of all the arts arising from ancient Zoroastrianism, astrology is now the mostmisunderstood. We no longer believe in the universal harmony of nature and thenecessary links between all effects and all causes. True astrology,incidentally, the kind which is related to the universal doctrine and theCabala, was profaned by the Greeks and the Romans in their decadence; thedoctrine of the seven heavens and the three mobiles,241[9781101992746_EPUB-23__4.xhtml] the primordial emanations of the ten spheres,the characters of the planets governed by the angels whose names were changedfrom the divinities of paganism, the influence of the spheres upon each other,the destinies attributed to the numbers, the proportional scale between thecelestial hierarchies that correspond to human hierarchies, all this wasmaterialized and rendered into superstition by the decadent readers andinterpreters of natal horoscopes in the Middle Ages. To bring astrology back toits primitive purity, in a sense, requires the creation of an entirely newscience; let us simply attempt to indicate the main principles, along with theirmost immediate and imminent consequences.We have said that the astral light receives and conserves all the imprints ofvisible matter; the result of which is that the daily disposition of the starsis reflected in this light. This, being the principal agent of life, affectsconception, the embryo, and the birth of infants through a series of devicesdestined to that end by nature. What is more, if this light is sensitive enoughto the images it receives to affect a pregnancy with the visible imprints of thefantasies or delights of the mother, there is even stronger reason to believethat it transmits to the mobile and still uncertain infant atmosphericimpressions and the diverse influences of a particular moment, from the entireplanetary system and from one or another more particular disposition of thestars.Nothing is indifferent in nature; a stone more or less on the road could breakor profoundly modify the destinies of the greatest men or the greatest empires;there is even stronger reason to believe the position of one star or another inthe sky would not be indifferent to the destiny of the child who is being born,and who by his birth enters into the same universal harmony as the astral world.The stars are linked to one another by attractions which keep them inequilibrium and regularly cause them to move in space; these networks of lighttravel from all the spheres to all the spheres, and there is no single point onany planet which is not connected to these indestructible threads. The preciseplace and time of birth must therefore be calculated by a true adept inastrology; then, when he has made the exact calculation of the astralinfluences, he must count the probabilities of state, that is to say thefacilities or obstacles that the child will find one day in his condition, inhis parents, in the temperament he received from them, and, in consequence, inhis natural tendencies, for the accomplishment of his destiny. Beyond this, theastrologer must take into account human liberty and initiative, if the childmanages one day to become a true man and extract himself with courageous willfrom fatal influences and the chain of destinies. You can now see that we do notgive too much weight to astrology but also that what we leave to it isincontestable: it is the scientific and magical calculation of theprobabilities.Astrology is as old as, or even older than, astronomy, and all the visionarysages of antiquity gave it their entire confidence; thus one must not carelesslycondemn and reject that which comes to us surrounded and supported by suchimposing authorities.Many long and patient observations, conclusive comparisons, and often-repeatedexperiments must have brought the ancient sages to their conclusions, and onemust, if one pretends to refute them, begin the same work all over again in thecontrary direction. Paracelsus was perhaps the last of the great practicalastrologers; he cured the sick with talismans created under the influence of thestars and recognized in all bodies the mark of their dominant star, and it wasthis, according to him, which was true universal medicine; the absolute scienceof nature, lost due to the errors of man and rediscovered only by a small numberof initiates. To recognize the sign of each star in men, in animals, and inplants is the true natural science of Solomon, that science which is said to belost but whose principles are, however, kept, like all other secrets, in thesymbolism of the Cabala.242 [9781101992746_EPUB-23__5.xhtml] We understand thatto read the writing of the stars one must know the stars themselves, know whatis obtained by the Cabalistic domification243 [9781101992746_EPUB-23__6.xhtml]of the sky, and by the intelligence of the Cabalistic planisphere, asrediscovered and explained by Gaffarel.244 [9781101992746_EPUB-23__7.xhtml] Inthis planisphere, the constellations form Hebrew letters and the mythologicalfigures can be replaced by the symbols of the Tarot. It is to this veryplanisphere that Gaffarel attributes the origin of the writings of thepatriarchs, and they had found in the chains of attractions between the starsthe first outlines of the primordial characters;245[9781101992746_EPUB-23__8.xhtml] the book of the heavens thus served as a modelfor Enoch, and the Cabalistic alphabet was a summary of the entire sky. Theabove does not lack in either poetry or more important in probability, and thestudy of the Tarot, which is evidently the primordial and hieroglyphic book ofEnoch, as had been understood by Guillaume Postel, suffices to convince us.The signs imprinted in the astral light by the reflection and the attraction ofthe stars is reproduced, then, as was discovered by the sages, in all bodieswhich are formed with the participation of this light. Men carry the signs oftheir star on their foreheads and most of all on their hands; animals, in theirentire form and in their particular signs; plants reveal them in their leavesand their seeds; minerals, in their veins and in their level of friability. Thestudy of these characteristics was the work of an entire life for Paracelsus,and his figures and talismans are the results of his research; but he did notprovide the key, and the Cabalistic astral alphabet, with its correspondences,is incomplete; the science of unconventional magical writing was arrested,within the public domain, at Gaffarel’s planisphere.The serious art of divination rests entirely upon the knowledge of these signs.Chiromancy246 [9781101992746_EPUB-23__9.xhtml] is the art of reading the writingof the stars in the lines of the hand, and metoposcopy247[9781101992746_EPUB-23_10.xhtml] looks for the same characters or theiranalogues on the foreheads of those who consult it. In effect, the lines formedon the human face due to nervous contractions are determined by destiny, and theinfluence of the nervous tissue is absolutely analogous to the networks formedbetween worlds and the chains of attractions between the stars. The destinies oflife are thus necessarily written in our lines, and we often recognize at firstglance, on the forehead of a stranger, one or more mysterious letters from theCabalistic planisphere. This letter represents a thought system, and thosethoughts must dominate the existence of this man. If the mark is troubled andhas difficulty outlining itself, there is a battle in him between his destinyand his will, and in his emotions and strongest tendencies his entire past isrevealed to the mage; the future is then easy to estimate, and if at timesevents mislead the wisdom of the diviner, the patient nonetheless remainsimpressed and convinced by the superhuman science of the adept.The head of man is based on the model of the celestial spheres; it attracts andemits, and it is the head which, when a child is conceived, is formed andmanifests itself first. It is thus affected in an absolute manner by the astralinfluences, and its numerous protuberances are witness to the diverseattractions. Phrenology,248 [9781101992746_EPUB-23_11.xhtml] a science whoseproblems test the patience and faith of scholars, must thus find its finalsolution in a purified and scientific astrology.According to Ptolemy, the Sun dries and the Moon humidifies; according to theCabalists, the Sun represents strict Justice, and the Moon is sympathetic Mercy.It is the Sun which creates storms; it is the Moon which, through a sort of softatmospheric pressure, like breathing, raises and lowers the sea. We read in theZohar, one of the great sacred books of the Cabala, that “the magical Serpent,son of the Sun, will devour the world, when the Sea, daughter of the Moon, putsher foot down on its head and subjugates it.” It is for this reason that, amongthe ancients, Venus was daughter of the Sea, just as Diana was identified withthe Moon; it is for this reason that the name Mary signifies star of the sea orsalt of the sea.249 [9781101992746_EPUB-23__1.xhtml] It was to consecrate thisCabalistic doctrine within the beliefs of the vulgar that it was said inprophetic language: It is woman who must crush the head of the serpent.250[9781101992746_EPUB-23__2.xhtml]Girolamo Cardano, one of the boldest of seekers and undeniably the most skilledastrologer of his time; Girolamo Cardano, who was, if we believe the legendsurrounding his death, a martyr to his faith in astrology, left us a calculuswith which each of us can predict the good or bad fortune for all the years ofour life. His theory rests upon his own experiments, and he claims that hiscalculations have never been wrong. To know what one’s fortune will be in aparticular year, one summarizes the events of those that preceded it by four,eight, twelve, nineteen, and thirty years. The number four is fulfillment; thenumber eight, that of Venus or natural things; the number twelve, which is thatof the cycle of Jupiter, corresponds to success; the number nineteen correspondsto the cycles of the Moon and of Mars; the number thirty is that of Saturn orFate. Thus, for example, if I wish to know what will happen to me in this year,1855, I will go over in my memory what real and decisive things have happened tome regarding the progress of life four years ago, what I experienced ofhappiness or natural unhappiness eight years ago, what I had in terms ofsuccesses and failures twelve years ago, the vicissitudes and misfortunes thatoccurred to me nineteen years ago, and what happened to me which was sad orfated thirty years ago; then, taking into consideration those facts that areirrevocably accomplished and the progress of age, I rely upon the probabilitiesanalogous to those which I already attribute to the influence of the planets,and I say: In 1851, I had occupations which were moderately but sufficientlylucrative, along with several difficulties regarding my position; in 1847, I wasviolently separated from my family, the result of this separation being greatsuffering for me and mine; in 1843, I traveled as an apostle, speaking to peoplewho were being persecuted by men with bad intentions: in two words, I washonored and excluded; lastly, in 1825, I left my family, and I set upon thefatal course which brought me to science and misfortune. I can thus concludethat this year I will have work, experience poverty and troubles, have an exileof the heart, experience a change of location, receive publicity and objections,and there will occur an event which will decide the rest of my existence; and Ialready find all kinds of reasons in the present which lead me to believe inthis future. I conclude that, for me and in this present year, experienceperfectly confirms the precision of the astrological calculus of Cardano.Incidentally, this calculation has to do with the climacteric years, or thegreater climacteric, of the ancient astrologers. Climacteric means arranged inlevels or calculated according to the degrees of a scale. JohannesTrithemius,251 [9781101992746_EPUB-23__3.xhtml] in his book On the SevenSecondary Causes, very curiously estimated the return of good years or bad yearsfor all the empires of the world; we shall provide an exact and clear analysisof that same book in the twenty-first chapter of our Ritual, with thecontinuation of the work of Trithemius up until our day and the application ofthe magical scale to contemporary events, in order to deduce the most strikingprobabilities relative to the near future of France, of Europe, and the world.According to all the great masters of astrology, the comets are the stars ofexceptional heroes and only visit the Earth to announce great changes; theplanets preside over collections of beings and modify the destinies ofaggregations of men; the stars, further and weaker in their effects, attractindividuals and determine their characteristics; sometimes a group of stars hasan influence over the entire destiny of a man, and often a great number of soulsare attracted by the distant rays of a same sun. When we die, our interior lighttakes leave according to the attraction of its star, and it is thus that we canbe reborn in other universes, where the soul makes itself new clothing,analogous to the progress or decrease of its beauty; because our souls,separated from our bodies, resemble shooting stars, they are globules ofanimated light which are always searching for their center in order torediscover their equilibrium and their movement; but they must first of all freethemselves from the embrace of the serpent, which is to say the impure astrallight which surrounds and captivates them as long as the power of their willdoes not raise them above it. The immersion of the living star in the dead lightis a terrible torture, comparable to that of Mezentius. The soul freezes andburns there at the same time and has no means to free itself except to reenterthe current of exterior forms and take on a mantle of flesh and to then fightenergetically against the instincts in order to strengthen its moral libertythat will allow it, at the moment of death, to break the chains of the Earth andfly up triumphantly towards the consoling star whose light smiles upon it.Given this fact, we can understand what the fires of hell are; they areidentical to the demon or the ancient serpent; this is of what the salvation andthe damnation of men consists, all of whom are called and successively elected,but in small numbers, after having been exposed by their own fault to the fallinto the eternal fire.Such is the great and sublime revelation of the mages, revelatory mother of allsymbols, all doctrines, and all cults.We can already see how much Dupuis was in error when he believed that all thereligions arose solely from astronomy. It was, on the contrary, astrology whichgave birth to astronomy, and primordial astrology is one of the branches of theholy Cabala, the science of sciences and the religion of religions.We can also see on the seventeenth page of the Tarot an admirable allegory: anaked woman, who represents all at once Truth, Nature and Wisdom, without aveil, bending towards the earth over two urns out of which she pours water andfire; just above her head shines a starry septenary above which is a star witheight rays, that of Venus, symbol of peace and love; around this woman theregrow the plants of the earth, and on one of these plants has just landed thebutterfly of Psyche, emblem of the soul, replaced in several copies of thesacred book by a bird, a more Egyptian symbol and probably older. This figure,which, in the modern Tarot, carries the title of the shining Star, is analogousto many Hermetic symbols, and has some similarity with the Flaming Star of theinitiates of Freemasonry, which expresses the majority of the mysteries of thesecret doctrine of the Rosy Cross."},{"pageContent":"18 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-24_vector-1.jpg] S.POTIONS AND SPELLSJUSTITIA.MYSTERIUM.CANES.252 [9781101992746_EPUB-24_fn.xhtml]We will now deal with the most criminal abuse of the magical sciences that thereis: the use of magic, or rather sorcery, to poison. Here we must understand whatwe are writing about, not to teach, but to forewarn.If human justice, in striking out against adepts, only ever attackednecromancers and poisoning sorcerers, it is certain, as we have alreadyremarked, that their harshness would have been just and the most severeintimidation could never be overly excessive in regards to such criminals.However one must not believe that the power over life and death which secretlybelongs to the mage has always been used to satisfy some cowardly revenge or aneven more cowardly cupidity; in the Middle Ages, as in the ancient world,magical societies often struck down or slowly killed off the revealers or theprofaners of the mysteries, and when they had to avoid striking with the magicalsword, when the spilling of blood was to be feared, the Aqua Tofana,253[9781101992746_EPUB-24_11.xhtml] the aromatic bouquets, the shirt of Nessus, andother lesser known and stranger instruments of death served sooner or later inthe execution of the terrible sentences of the Free Judges.254[9781101992746_EPUB-24_13.xhtml]We have said that there exists within magic a great and unspeakable arcanum,which is never communicated between adepts, and that most of all one mustprevent the profane from surmising; in the past, whoever revealed or causedothers to discover the key to this supreme arcanum through imprudent revelationswas immediately condemned to death and was often forced to execute his ownsentence.Cazotte’s infamous prophetic dinner, written about by La Harpe,255[9781101992746_EPUB-24_14.xhtml] has not yet been understood; and La Harpe, intelling it, yielded to the rather natural desire to marvel his readers byexaggerating the details. All the men present at this dinner, with the exceptionof La Harpe, were initiates and revealers, or at least profaners, of themysteries. Cazotte, more highly ranked than all the others on the scale ofinitiation, pronounced a sentence of death over them in the name of illuminism,and this sentence was diversely, but rigorously, executed, as all the othersimilar sentences have been over many years and over many centuries in the past,against the abbé of Villars, Urbain Grandier, and so many others; and thoserevolutionary philosophers at Cazotte’s dinner party died just as Cagliostrodied, abandoned within the prisons of the Inquisition, like Catherine Théot’smystic group;256 [9781101992746_EPUB-24_15.xhtml] as the imprudent Schröpfer,257[9781101992746_EPUB-24_16.xhtml] forced to kill himself in the midst of hismagical triumphs and the universal enthusiasm for them; as Kotzebue thedeserter, stabbed by Karl Sand,258 [9781101992746_EPUB-24_17.xhtml] and so manyothers whose cadavers were found without anyone ever finding out the cause oftheir sudden and bloody deaths.We remember the strange speech which the president of the revolutionary tribunaladdressed to Cazotte himself, thus condemning to death his brother and hisco-initiate. The knot of the terrible drama of ’93 is still hidden in thedarkest sanctuary of the secret societies; to adepts of good faith who wished toemancipate the people, other adepts, who belonged to an opposing sect and wererelated to more ancient traditions, provided a terrible opposition by meansanalogous to those of their adversaries; they rendered the practice of the greatarcanum impossible by unmasking the theory. The masses understood nothing, butthey defied everything, and fell, in discouragement, lower than they had wantedto rise. The great arcanum remained as unknown as ever; only the adepts,neutralized by one another, could not exercise its power to dominate others, orto deliver themselves; they thus mutually condemned themselves as traitors anddragged one another into exile, suicide, towards the dagger and the guillotine.Some will ask me perhaps if in our day such terrible dangers still threaten theintruders into the occult sanctuary or the revealers of the arcanum. Why shouldI answer to the incredulity of the curious? If I expose myself to a violentdeath to teach them, they would certainly not try to save me; if they are afraidfor themselves, then they should abstain from all imprudent investigations: thatis what I can tell them.Let us now return to poisonous magic.Alexandre Dumas, in his novel The Count of Monte Cristo, revealed some of thepractices of this gruesome science. We will not repeat his sad theories aboutcrime, how to poison plants, how animals fed with poisoned plants developunhealthy flesh and can, when they are used in turn as food for humans, causedeath without leaving any trace of the poison; we shall not say how, throughvenomous unctions, we can poison the walls of houses, and the air which becomesbreathable again only through fumigation, requiring the operator to wear theglass mask of the Holy Cross; we will leave these mysterious abominations to theancient Canidia, we shall not examine how far the infernal rites of Saganahelped to perfect the arts of Locusta.259 [9781101992746_EPUB-24_18.xhtml] Itsuffices to say that these malefactors of the worst type distilled togetherpoisons and contagious sicknesses, the venom of reptiles and the harmful sapfrom plants; that they took the toxic and narcotic fluids from fungi, and theytook from Jimson weed its asphyxiating principle; from the peach tree and cherrylaurel they took that poison with which a single drop placed on the tongue or inthe ear strikes you down like lightning and kills even the most healthy andstrongest living beings. They cooked the white sap of the tithymalus with milkin which vipers and asps had been drowned; they carefully gathered and broughtback from their voyages, or imported at great cost, the sap of the manchineel orthe deadly fruits of Java, manioc juice, and other poisons; they pulverizedflint and mixed impure ashes with the dried slime of reptiles; they composedhideous potions from the effluents of excited mares or the secretions of dogs inheat. Human blood was mixed with vile drugs, and with this was created an oilwhich killed through its smell alone: it reminds one of Panurge’s Bourbonianpie. They even wrote recipes for poisons while disguising them with technicalterms from alchemy, and, in more than one so-called old Hermetic book, thesecret of the powder of projection is nothing other than that of the powder ofsuccession.260 [9781101992746_EPUB-24_19.xhtml] In the Grand Grimoire261[9781101992746_EPUB-24__1.xhtml] we can still find one of these recipes, lessdisguised than the others, but titled only Means of Making Gold: it is ahorrible brew of verdigris, vitriol, arsenic and sawdust, which will, if it isgood, immediately consume a branch which one dips into it and rapidly dissolvean iron nail. Giambattista della Porta,262 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__2.xhtml] inhis Magia Naturalis, gives a recipe for the poison of the Borgias, but as wemight imagine, he makes fun of his readers and does not divulge the entiretruth, which would have been much too dangerous in such a work. We will thusprovide Porta’s recipe here, if only to satisfy the curiosity of our readers.The toad on its own is not venomous, but it acts as a sponge for poisons: it isthe mushroom of the animal kingdom. Take a large toad, says Porta, enclose it ina jar with vipers and asps; give them as their only food over several dayspoisonous mushrooms, foxglove, and hemlock, then aggravate them by beating them,burning them, and by tormenting them in all kinds of manners, until they die ofrage and hunger; you then sprinkle the slag of lead crystal ground together witheuphorbia on them, after which, you put them in a well-stoppered retort and heatit over a fire until all the humidity is absorbed; after which you allow it tocool, and you separate the ashes of the corpses from the incombustible particlesthat will have remained at the bottom of the retort: you will then have twopoisons, one a liquid and one a powder. The liquid will be as effective as theterrible Aqua Tofana; the powder will wither or age someone who has been exposedto a pinch of it added to their drink in a few days, and then they will diewhile suffering horribly, or in total atony.263 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__3.xhtml]One must admit that this recipe’s magical aspect is most ugly and black, and itreminds one, in a heart-wrenching manner, of the abominable recipes of Canidiaand Medea.The witches of the Middle Ages claimed to receive similar powders during theSabbath, and sold them at high prices to ignorance and hate: it was through therumor of similar mysteries that they spread terror throughout the countrysideand managed to cast spells. Once imagination is struck, once the nervous systemis attacked, the victim perishes quickly, and the terror of their friends andfamily complete his perdition. The witch264 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__4.xhtml] isalmost always a kind of human toad, all swelled up with old grudges; witcheswere poor, rejected by all, and in consequence filled with hatred. The fearwhich they inspired was their consolation and their revenge; they themselves,poisoned by a society of which they had only ever experienced its rejection andits vices, poisoned in their turn those who were weak enough to fear them, andthey took revenge upon beauty and youthfulness with their cursed old age andunpardonable ugliness.The operation of these evil works and the accomplishment of these hideousmysteries constituted and confirmed that which we called the pact with the evilspirit. It is certain that the operator must have been possessed by evil, bodyand soul, and justifiably deserved universal and irrevocable condemnation asexpressed by the allegory of hell. That human souls had descended to such adegree of wickedness and insanity must no doubt astonish and grieve us; but mustthere not exist the depths as a foundation for the heights of the most sublimevirtues, and does not the abyss of the hells demonstrate through antithesis theelevation and infinite grandeur of heaven?In the North, where the instincts are more compressed and hardy; in Italy, wherepassions are more expansive and ardent, they still fear spells and the evil eye;in Naples, they do not brave the jettatura265 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__5.xhtml]recklessly, and they even recognize beings evilly endowed with this power bycertain external signs. To protect oneself, one must carry horns on one’sperson, say the experts, and the people, who take everything literally, hastento adorn themselves with little horns, without thinking more about the meaningof this allegory. Horns, attributes of Jupiter Ammon, Bacchus, and Moses, arethe symbol of moral power or enthusiasm, and the magicians wish to say that, tobrave the jettatura, one must dominate, with great audacity, great enthusiasm,or great thought, the fatal currents of the instincts. It is thus that almostall popular superstitions are profane interpretations of some great axiom ormarvelous arcanum of occult wisdom. Does not Pythagoras, in writing down hisadmirable symbols,266 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__6.xhtml] bequeath to the sages aperfect philosophy and to the vulgar a new series of vain observances andridiculous practices? Thus, when he said: “Do not gather what falls from thetable, do not cut trees on the great road, do not kill the serpent that hasgotten into your enclosure,” was he not providing transparent allegories for theprecepts of charity, either social or individual? And when he said: “Do not lookat yourself in the mirror by the light of the torch,” was this not an ingeniousmanner of teaching true knowledge of the self, which cannot exist in artificiallight and the prejudices of systems? This is the case for all of Pythagoras’sother precepts, which, as we know, were followed to the letter by a whole massof imbecilic disciples, to the point that, among the superstitious observancesof our provinces, there remains a rather large number that obviously originatefrom the primordial intelligence of Pythagoras’s symbols.The word “superstition” derives from a Latin word which signifies “to survive.”It is the sign which survives thought; it is the cadaver of religious practice.Superstition is to initiation what the idea of the devil is to that of God. Itis in this sense that the cult of images is forbidden and that a doctrine thatis most holy in its first conception can become superstitious and impious whenit is bereft of inspiration and spirit. It is then that religion, always onelike supreme reason, changes vestments and abandons the ancient rites tocupidity and the deceit of fallen priests metamorphosed, by their wickedness andtheir ignorance, into charlatans and temple soothsayers.[image/Doctrine_Magic_12.jpg]We can compare superstitions to magical emblems and characters whose meaning isno longer understood, and which we engrave haphazardly upon amulets andtalismans. The magical images of the ancients were pentacles, that is to sayCabalistic syntheses. The wheel of Pythagoras is a pentacle which is analogousto the wheels of Ezekiel, and those two figures express the same secrets and thesame philosophy: it is the key to all the pentacles, and we have already spokenthereof. The four animals, or more precisely the four-headed sphinx of the sameprophet, are identical to an admirable Indian symbol whose drawing we providehere, and which has to do with the science of the Great Arcanum. Saint John, inhis Book of Revelations, copied and amplified Ezekiel, and all the monstrousfigures in this marvelous book are so many magical pentacles to which Cabalistseasily find the key. But Christians, having rejected the science in their desireto amplify their faith, later wished to hide the origins of their doctrine andcondemned to the fires all the books of the Cabala and of magic. To destroy theoriginals is to lend a certain originality to the copies, and Saint Paul nodoubt knew this well when, no doubt with the best intentions in mind, he carriedout his auto-da-fé of knowledge at Ephesus.267 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__7.xhtml]It is thus that, six centuries later, the believer Omar had to sacrifice thelibrary of Alexandria to the originality of the Koran,268[9781101992746_EPUB-24__8.xhtml] and who knows whether, in time to come, somefuture apostle will wish to burn our literary museums and confiscate theprinting press in the name of some religious fad or some newly accreditedlegend?[image/Doctrine_Magic_13.jpg]The study of talismans and pentacles is one of the most curious branches ofmagic and is related to historical numismatics.There exist Indian, Egyptian, and Greek talismans, Cabalistic medallions comingfrom the ancient and modern Hebrews, the Gnostic Abraxas, and Byzantine amulets,occult coins in use among the members of secret societies and sometimes calledtokens of the Sabbath, and then there are the medallions of the Templars and thejewels of the Freemasons. Goclenius,269 [9781101992746_EPUB-24__9.xhtml] in hisTreatise on the Marvels of Nature, describes Solomon’s talismans and those ofRabbi Chaël.270 [9781101992746_EPUB-24_10.xhtml] The images of a great manyothers, including some of the most ancient, were engraved on the magicalcalendars of Tycho Brahe and Duchenteau, and have been reproduced in totality orin part in the initiatory calendars of M. Ragon,271[9781101992746_EPUB-24_12.xhtml] a vast and scholarly work which we recommend toour readers."},{"pageContent":"19 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-25_vector-1.jpg] T.THE STONE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, ELAGABALUSVOCATIO.SOL.AURUM.272 [9781101992746_EPUB-25_fn.xhtml]The ancients adored the Sun in the form a black stone which they calledElagabalus or Heliogabalus.273 [9781101992746_EPUB-25__1.xhtml] What was thesignificance of this stone, and how could it be the symbol of the most brilliantof stars?The disciples of Hermes, before promising to their adepts the elixir of longlife or the powder of projection, recommended that they search for thephilosopher’s stone, but why this stone?The great initiator of the Christians invited his faithful to build upon thestone, if they did not wish to see their works upturned.274[9781101992746_EPUB-25__2.xhtml] He called himself the cornerstone, and he toldthe most believing of the apostles: “Call yourself Pierre, because you are thepierre upon which I shall build my Church.”275 [9781101992746_EPUB-25__3.xhtml]This stone, say the masters of alchemy, is the true salt of the philosophers,which is one third of the composition of azoth. And AZOTH is, as we know, thename of the great hermetical agent and the true philosopher’s agent; thealchemists also represent their salt in the form of a cubical stone, as we canobserve in the Twelve Keys of Basilius Valentinus or in the allegories ofTrevisan.What then, in truth, is this stone? It is the foundation of absolute philosophy,it is supreme and immovable reason. Before contemplating the metallurgical work,one must forever be fixed upon the absolute principles of wisdom, one mustpossess the reason which is the touchstone of truth. Never will a biased man bethe king of nature and the master of transmutations. The philosopher’s stone isthus necessary before all else; but how does one find it? Hermes teaches us howwith his Emerald Tablet. One must separate the subtle from the fixed, with greatcare and attention. Thus we must free our certitudes from our beliefs and renderdistinct the respective domains of science and faith; we must understand that wedo not know the things which we believe in, and that we no longer believe in thethings which we are able to know, and that it is the essence of matters of faiththat they are unknown and indefinite, while it is the complete contrary formatters of science. We would conclude that science is based on reason andexperience, while faith is based on sentiment and reason. In other words, thephilosopher’s stone is true certitude, which human prudence ensures throughconscientious research and modest doubt, while religious enthusiasm attributesit to faith. Yet it belongs neither to reason without aspirations nor toaspirations without reason; true certitude is the reciprocal acquiescence ofreason which knows to sentiment which believes, and of sentiment which believesto reason which knows. The definitive alliance of reason and of faith resultsnot in their absolute distinction and separation but in their mutual control andtheir fraternal confluence. That is the meaning of the two columns of Solomon’sgate, one of which is called Jachin and the other Boaz, one of which is whiteand the other black. They are distinct and separate, they are even contrary inappearance, but if blind force wishes to unite them by bringing them together,the temple vault will collapse: because when separated, they have equalstrength, while reunited, they are two forces which mutually destroy each other.It is for the same reason that spiritual power weakens when it attempts to usurptemporal power and that temporal power perishes a victim to its encroachmentsinto spiritual power. Gregory VII lost the papacy, and the schismatic kings lostand will lose the monarchy. Human balance requires two feet, the worlds revolvewith two forces, creation requires two sexes. This is the meaning of Solomon’sArcanum, symbolized by the two temple columns, Jachin and Boaz.The Sun and the Moon of the alchemists correspond to the same symbol andcontribute to the perfection and stability of the philosopher’s stone. The Sunis the hieroglyphic sign of truth, because it is the visible source of light,and the raw stone is the symbol of stability. This is why the ancient mages tookthe stone of Elagabalus for the sign of the Sun itself, and it is for thisreason also that the alchemists of the Middle Ages pointed to the philosopher’sstone as the primary means of making philosophical gold, that is to say oftransforming all the vital forces symbolized by the six metals into the Sun,which is to say into truth and light, the first and indispensable operation ofthe Great Work, which brings one to secondary adaptations, and which allows thecreators of spiritual and living gold, through the analogies of nature, to findthe natural and raw gold; it allows the possessors of the true salt to find thetrue philosophical mercury and sulfur.To find the philosopher’s stone is therefore to have discovered the absolute, asall the masters say. And the absolute is that which admits to no error, it isthe fixed in the volatile, it is the rule of the imagination, it is thenecessity of being itself, it is the immutable law of reason and truth; theabsolute is what is. God himself is not without a reason for existing and canonly exist by virtue of a supreme and inevitable reason. It is therefore reasonwhich is the absolute; it is in it which we must believe if we wish our faith tohave a reasonable and solid foundation. We may say in our day and age that Godis but a hypothesis, but absolute reason is not one: it is essential to being.Saint Thomas276 [9781101992746_EPUB-25__4.xhtml] said: “A thing is not justbecause God wishes it, but God wishes it because it is just.” If Saint Thomashad made the logical deduction of all the consequences of this beautiful idea,he would have found the philosopher’s stone, and, instead of limiting himself tobeing the Angel of the Schools, he would have been their reformer.To believe in the reason for God and in the God of reason is to render atheismimpossible. It is idolaters who created atheists. When Voltaire said: “If Goddid not exist, we would have to invent him,” he sensed rather than understoodthe reason for God. Does God really exist? We know nothing of it, but we wish itto be the case, and it is for this reason that we believe it. Faith formulatedin this manner is reasonable faith, because it admits both doubt and science;and, in fact, we only believe in things which seem probable, but which we do notknow. To think otherwise is to be delirious; to speak otherwise is to expressoneself like a visionary or a fanatic. It is not to these type of people thatthe philosopher’s stone is promised.Ignorant people subverted primordial Christianity from its path by replacingscience with faith, experience with dreams, reality with the fantastic; theInquisitors for so many centuries made war on magic and managed to cover inshadows the ancient discoveries of the human spirit, so that today we gropeabout attempting to rediscover the key to the phenomena of nature. Yet allnatural phenomena depend upon a single and immutable law represented by thephilosopher’s stone and most of all symbolized by its form, that of the cube.This law, expressed in the Cabala by the quaternary, had provided the Hebrewswith all the mysteries of their divine tetragrammaton. We can thus say that thephilosopher’s stone is squared in all senses, like the celestial Jerusalem ofSaint John, and written upon one of its sides is the name[image/9781101992746_EPUB-25_vector-2.jpg],277 [9781101992746_EPUB-25__5.xhtml]and on the other that of GOD; on another of its sides is written ADAM, and theother HEVA, then that of AZOT and INRI on the other two sides. On thefrontispiece of a French translation of a book by the Sieur de Nuysement278[9781101992746_EPUB-25__6.xhtml] is the spirit of the Earth standing on a cubesurrounded by tongues of flame; he has for a phallus a caduceus, and the Sun andthe Moon on his right and left breast; he is bearded, crowned, and holds ascepter in his hand. This is the Azoth of the sages on his pedestal of salt andsulfur. We sometimes give this image the symbolic head of the goat of Mendes; itis the Baphomet of the Templars, the goat of the Sabbath, and the Verb of theGnostics; strange images which were used as bogeymen for the vulgar after havingbeen used in their meditations by the sages, innocent hieroglyphs of thought andfaith which were used as a pretext for the passions of persecution. How unhappymen are in their ignorance, but how they would despise themselves if they evercame to know it!"},{"pageContent":"20 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-26_vector-1.jpg] U.THE UNIVERSAL MEDICINECAPUT.RESURRECTIO.CIRCULUS.279 [9781101992746_EPUB-26_fn.xhtml]Most physical maladies derive from moral maladies, according to the unique anduniversal magical doctrine and due to the law of analogies.A great passion to which we abandon ourselves always corresponds to a greatmalady for which we are preparing. The deadly sins are called that because theycause one to physically and actually die.Alexander the Great died of pride. He was naturally temperate and abandonedhimself through pride to the excesses which caused his death.François I died from adultery.Louis XV died because of his Parc-aux-Cerfs.280 [9781101992746_EPUB-26__1.xhtml]When Marat was assassinated, he died of anger and envy. He was a proudmonomaniac who believed that he alone was just and wished to kill all that wasnot Marat.Many of our contemporaries died of disappointed ambitions after the Februaryrevolution.281 [9781101992746_EPUB-26__2.xhtml]Once your will is irrevocably confirmed in an absurd tendency, you are dead, andthe reef that you shall break yourself upon is not far off.It is thus true to say that wisdom conserves and prolongs life.The great Master said: “My flesh is food and my blood is drink. Eat my flesh anddrink my blood, and you shall have life.”282 [9781101992746_EPUB-26__3.xhtml]And since the vulgar grumbled, he added: “The flesh has no value here; the wordsI speak to you are spirit and life.”283 [9781101992746_EPUB-26__4.xhtml] Hetherefore wished to say: “Drink of my spirit and live from my life.”And when he was about to die, he bound the memory of his life to the symbol ofbread and that of his spirit to the symbol of wine, and thus instituted thecommunion of faith, of hope, and of charity.It is in the same sense that the hermetic masters said: Render gold drinkableand you shall have the universal medicine; which is to say: Appropriate truth toyour needs, so that it becomes the source from which you drink all your days,and you too shall gain the immortality of the sages. Temperance, peacefulness ofthe soul, simplicity of character, the calm and reason of the will render mannot only happy but hardy and strong. It is by becoming reasonable and good thatman becomes immortal. We are the authors of our destinies, and God does not savewithout our participation.Death does not exist for the sage: death is a phantom rendered horrifying byignorance and vulgar weakness.Change attests to movement, and movement reveals but life. The cadaver itselfwould not decompose if it were dead: all the molecules which compose it remainalive and move to free themselves. And you think that the spirit freed itselffirst so as to no longer live! You believe that thought and love can die whenthe grossest of matter itself does not die!If change must be called death, we die and are reborn every day, because everyday our form changes.Let us then be afraid of dirtying and tearing our clothes, but let us not fearof leaving them when the hour of rest arrives.The embalming and conservation of cadavers is an unnatural superstition. It isan attempt to create death; it is the forced immobilization of a substance forwhich life has need. But one must not hasten to destroy or make disappearcadavers either; because nothing is accomplished abruptly in nature, and weshould not risk violently breaking the links of a soul which is still detachingitself.Death is never instantaneous; it operates by degrees, like sleep. While theblood is not yet completely cold, while the nerves can still tremble, a man isnot completely dead, and if none of the organs essential to life are destroyed,the soul can be recalled, either by accident or by a strong will.A philosopher said that he would sooner doubt universal testimony than believein the resurrection of the dead,284 [9781101992746_EPUB-26__5.xhtml] and in thishe spoke imprudently; because it is upon his faith in universal testimony thathe believed in the impossibility of resurrection. If a resurrection were to beproven, what would be the result? That one would have to deny the evidence orrenounce reason? It would be absurd to suppose so. One must simply conclude thatwe had wrongly believed that resurrection was impossible. Ab actu ad posse valetconsecutio.285 [9781101992746_EPUB-26__6.xhtml]Let us now dare to affirm that resurrection is possible, and even that ithappens more often than we think. How many people whose death is juridically andscientifically certified were found to be dead, it is true, in their coffins,but had then revived, and had gnawed away at their wrists so as to open theirveins and thus escape their horrible suffering through a new death. A doctorwould tell us that these people were not dead but were lethargic. But what islethargy? It is the name we give to a death which has begun but does notterminate, to a death which has just denied a return to life. We can alwayseasily get out of such problems with words, when it is impossible to actuallyexplain things.The soul is attached to the body by tendency, and once that tendency ends, it isthe certain sign that the soul will depart. Magnetic sleep is a lethargy or afalse death and can be healed by the will. Etherization, or the torpor producedby chloroform, is a veritable lethargy which sometimes results in a definitivedeath when the soul, happy with its temporary departure, makes the effort ofwill to leave definitively: which is possible for those who have vanquishedhell, that is to say whose moral force is superior to that of astral attraction.Also, resurrection is only possible for elementary souls, and it is these soulsabove all which are exposed to the possibility of reviving involuntarily intheir tomb. Great men and true sages are never buried alive.In our Ritual we will provide the theory and practice of resurrectionism, and tothose who ask me if I have resuscitated the dead I would answer that if I toldthem, they would not believe me.It remains for us to examine here if the abolition of pain is possible and if itis advantageous to use chloroform or magnetism for surgical operations. Wethink, and science will recognize this later, that in diminishing the senses wediminish life, and that all we removed in terms of pain in such circumstancesacts in favor of death. Pain attests to the struggle for life; we also noticethat with persons who are operated upon under sedation, the dressings appliedafter the operation are excessively painful. If we repeated sedation viachloroform after each application of dressings, one of two things would occur:either the patent would die or between the dressings the pain would return andcontinue. We do not do violence to nature with impunity."},{"pageContent":"21 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-27_vector-1.jpg] X.DIVINATIONDENTES.FURCA.AMENS.286 [9781101992746_EPUB-27_fn.xhtml]The author of this book has often dared in his life, and no fear has ever heldhis thoughts captive. But it is not without a legitimate terror that he arrivesat the end of the magical doctrine.We are now concerned with revealing or rather re-veiling the Great Arcanum, thatterrible secret, that secret of life and death expressed in the Bible by theformidable and symbolic speech of the symbolic serpent itself: I. NEQUAQUAMMORIEMINI, II. SED ERITIS, III. SICUT DII, IV. SCIENTES BONUM ET MALUM.287[9781101992746_EPUB-27__2.xhtml]One of the privileges of the initiate to the great Arcanum, and that whichsummarizes all the others, is that of Divination.According to the vulgar meaning of this word, “to divine” signifies toconjecture about that which we do not know, but the real meaning of this word isineffable because it is sublime. To divine (divinari), is to exercise divinity.The word divinus, in Latin, signifies more and something other than divus, andits meaning is equivalent to man-god.288 [9781101992746_EPUB-27__3.xhtml] Devin,in French, contains the four letters of the word DIEU, plus the letter N, whichcorresponds, in its form, to the Hebrew letter aleph[image/9781101992746_EPUB-27_vector-2.jpg], and which expresses Cabalisticallyand hieroglyphically the great Arcanum, whose symbol, in the Tarot, is thefigure of the Magician.He who understands perfectly the absolute numerical value of[image/9781101992746_EPUB-27_vector-3.jpg] multiplied by N, with the grammaticalforce of the final N in the words which express science, art, or puissance, andthen adds the five letters of the word DEVIN, in such a manner as to enter fiveinto four and two into one—that person, in translating the number he finds intoprimordial Hebrew letters, will write the occult name of the great Arcanum, andwill possess a word of which the holy Tetragrammaton itself is but an image.289[9781101992746_EPUB-27__4.xhtml]To be devin,290 [9781101992746_EPUB-27__5.xhtml] according to the force of thisword, is thus to be divine, and something even more mysterious than that aswell.The two signs of human divinity, or of divine humanity, are prophecies andmiracles.To be a prophet is to see ahead of time the effects that exist in the causes, itis to read the astral light; to make miracles is to act upon the universal agentand submit it to our will.Some will ask the author of this book if he is a prophet and a thaumaturge.The curious may search out and read all I have written previous to certainevents which were then accomplished in this world. As to what I could have saidand done, if I recounted them, and if they were truly miraculous, would youbelieve me based on my words alone?Incidentally, one of the essential conditions for divination is to never beforced into it and to never submit to temptation, that is to say to a test. Themasters of the science never yielded to anyone’s curiosity. The Sibyl burnt herbooks when Tarquinius refused to value them at their true worth;291[9781101992746_EPUB-27__6.xhtml] the great Master remained silent when theyasked him for the signs of his divine mission;292[9781101992746_EPUB-27__7.xhtml] Agrippa died of misery rather than obey thosewho demanded a horoscope of him. To give proofs of the science to those whodoubt the science itself is to initiate the unworthy, is to profane the gold ofthe sanctuary, is to merit the excommunication of the sages and the death of therevealers.The essence of divination, that is to say the Great Magical Arcanum, isrepresented in all the symbols of the science and is closely tied to the uniqueand primordial doctrine of Hermes. In philosophy it provides absolute certitude;in religion, the universal secret of faith; in physics, the composition, thedecomposition, the recomposition, the realization, and the adaptation of thephilosophical mercury, called azoth by the alchemists; in dynamics it multipliesour strengths by those of perpetual motion; it is at once mystical,metaphysical, and material, with correspondences in effect across the threeworlds; it obtains the mercy of God, the truth of science, and the gold ofwealth, because metallurgical transmutation is both an allegory and a reality,as all adepts of the true science well know.Yes, we can truly and materially make gold with the stone of the sages, which isan amalgam of salt, sulfur, and mercury combined three times in azoth by atriple sublimation and a triple fixation. Yes, the operation is often easy andcan be done in one day, in one instant; other times it takes months and years.But, to succeed at the Great Work, one must be divinus, or devin, in theCabalistic sense of the word, and it is indispensable to have renounced, forone’s own interest, the advantages of the wealth of which one will become thedispenser. Raymond Lully enriched sovereigns, seeded Europe with his funds, andremained poor; Nicolas Flamel, who is certainly dead, whatever they say abouthis legend, only found the Great Work through asceticism and a completedetachment from wealth. He was initiated through the intelligence which hesuddenly acquired from the book of Aesch Mezareph,293[9781101992746_EPUB-27__8.xhtml] written in Hebrew by the Cabalist Abraham,perhaps the same one who wrote the Sepher Yetzirah. Yet this intelligence was,for Flamel, a merited intuition, or rather rendered possible by the personalpreparations of an adept. I believe I have said enough.Divination is thus an intuition, and the key to that intuition is the universaland magical doctrine of analogies. It is through these analogies that the mageinterprets dreams, as we can see in the Bible that the patriarch Joseph did longago in Egypt:294 [9781101992746_EPUB-27__9.xhtml] because analogies in thereflections of the astral light are as rigorous as the nuances of color in thesolar light and can be calculated and explained with great exactitude. It isonly necessary to know the degree of intelligence of the dreamer and we canreveal to him everything through his own dreams, to the point of throwing himinto a profound wonder.Hypnotism, precognition, and second sight are all of one disposition, eitheraccidental or habitual, dreamed in a voluntary sleep or while awake, that is tosay they perceive the analogical reflections of the astral light. We willexplain all this, until it is obvious in our Ritual; at which point we willprovide the means so looked for to regularly produce and direct magneticphenomena. As to the divinatory instruments, they are simply a means ofcommunication between the seer and the consultant, and often serve only to fixthe two wills upon the same sign; vague figures, complicated and mobile, help toassemble the reflections of the astral fluid, and it is thus that we see in thedregs of a coffee cup, in the clouds, in the white of an egg, etc., the fatefulforms which exist only in the translucent, which is to say in the imagination ofthe operators. Vision in water operates through glare and the fatigue of theoptic nerve, which yields its functions to the translucent and produces anillusion of the brain, which then takes reflections of the astral light for realimages; also, nervous people, having weak eyesight and vivid imaginations, aremost suited to this type of divination, which has the most success when it isperformed by children. But do not be confused regarding the function weattribute to the imagination in the divinatory arts. We see through theimagination, without a doubt, and that is the natural aspect of the miracle, butwe see true things, and it is that which makes for the marvelous in this naturalwork. We refer to the experiences of all true adepts. The author of this bookhas experimented with all kinds of divination and obtained results which werealways proportional to the exactitude of his scientific operations and the goodfaith of his consultants.The Tarot, that miraculous book, the inspiration for all the sacred books of theancient peoples, is, because of the analogical precision of its figures and itsnumbers, the most perfect instrument for divination, which can be used withcomplete confidence. In fact, the oracles of this book are always rigorouslytrue, at least in one sense, and while it predicts nothing, it always revealshidden things and provides consultants with the wisest of advice. Alliette, whowas a wig maker before becoming the Cabalist of the previous century, afterhaving spent thirty years meditating upon the Tarot; Alliette, whoCabalistically called himself Etteilla, by reading his name as one readsHebrew,295 [9781101992746_EPUB-27__1.xhtml] was very close to finding all thatwas hidden in that strange book, but he only managed to displace the keys of theTarot because he did not understand them, and he inverted the order and thecharacter of the figures without completely destroying the analogies, becausethey are so sympathetic and correspond so well to one another. The writings ofEtteilla, which have become relatively rare, are obscure, tiring, and of a trulybarbarous style; not all his works were published, and the manuscripts of thisfather of modern card readers are still in the hands of a Parisian librarian,who was most willing to show them to me. What we can see in them which is mostremarkable is the unrelenting work and incontestable good faith of the author,who all his life sensed the grandeur of the occult sciences and who died at thedoor of the sanctuary without ever having penetrated beyond the veil. He hadlittle respect for Agrippa and made much of Jean Belot, and knew nothing of thephilosophy of Paracelsus; but he had a well-practiced intuition, a relentlesswill, and more imagination than good judgment: it was too little to make him amage, but it was more than enough to make him a very skillful vulgar seer, andin consequence very credible. Also, Etteilla had a faddish success, which awiser magician might have been wrong to not claim for himself, but he willcertainly never make that claim.In saying, at the end of our Ritual, the last word about the Tarot, we willindicate the complete manner of reading it, and in consequence of consulting it,not only regarding the probabilities of destiny, but also and most of allregarding the problems of philosophy and religion, of which the Tarot alwaysprovides a certain answer of the most admirable precision, if we explain it inthe hierarchical order of the analogy of the three worlds with the three colorsand the four nuances which compose the sacred septenary. All this is part of thepositive practice of magic, and can only be summarily indicated and onlyestablished in principle in this first part, which contains only the doctrine ofhigh magic and the philosophical and religious key to the high sciences,understood or rather ignored under the name of occult science."},{"pageContent":"22 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-28_vector-1.jpg] Z.SUMMARY AND GENERAL KEY TO THE FOUR OCCULT SCIENCESSIGNA.THOT.PAN.296 [9781101992746_EPUB-28_fn.xhtml]Let us now summarize all of science through principles.Analogy is the last word of science and the first word of faith.Harmony is in equilibrium, and equilibrium subsists in the analogy of opposites.Absolute unity is the supreme reason and the last of all things. Yet this reasoncan neither be one person nor three persons:297 [9781101992746_EPUB-28__1.xhtml]it is one reason, and it is reason par excellence.To create equilibrium one must separate and unite: separate at the poles, unitein the center.To reason with faith is to destroy faith; to turn philosophy into mysticism isto attack reason.Reason and faith mutually exclude each other by their nature and are unitedtogether through analogy.Analogy is the only possible mediator between the visible and the invisible,between the finite and the infinite. The doctrine is the continually ascendinghypothesis of a presumable equation.For the ignorant, it is the hypothesis which is the absolute affirmation, andthe absolute affirmation which is the hypothesis.There are in science necessary hypotheses, and he who looks to realize themenlarges the science without restraining faith: because on the other side offaith lies the infinite.We believe what we do not know but also what reason wishes us to admit. Todefine the object of faith and delimit it is thus to formulate the unknown.Professions of faith are formulas of the ignorance and aspirations of man. Thetheorems of science are monuments to his conquests.The man who denies God is just as fanatical as he who defines him with apretense of infallibility. We ordinarily define God by saying all that he isnot.Man creates God through analogy of the lesser with the greater: the result isthat the conception of God by man is always that of an infinite man, which makesman a finite God.Man can realize what he believes to the degree that he knows with reason what heis ignorant of.The analogy of opposites is the relation of light to darkness, of the convex tothe concave, of the full to the empty. Allegory, mother of all the doctrines, isthe substitution of imprints with seals, of shadows with realities. It is thelie of truth and the truth in lies.One does not invent a doctrine, one veils a truth, and a shadow is produced toprotect the eyes of the weak. The initiator is not an impostor, he is arevealer, that is to say, according to the expression of the Latin wordrevelare, a man who veils again. He is the creator of a new shadow.Analogy is the key to all the secrets of nature and the only raison d’être ofall revelations.That is why religions seem to be written in the heavens and in all of nature; itmust be so: because the work of God is the book of God, and in what he writes weshould see the expression of his thought, and in consequence of his being, sincewe conceive of him as supreme thought. Dupuis and Volney saw only a plagiarismin the splendid analogy,298 [9781101992746_EPUB-28__2.xhtml] which should havebrought them to recognize the catholicity, that is to say the universality ofthe primordial doctrine, the unique, magical, Cabalistic, and immutablerevelation through analogy.Analogy gives the mages all the powers of nature; analogy is the quintessence ofthe philosopher’s stone, it is the secret of perpetual movement, it is thequadrature of the circle, it is the temple which rests on the two columns Jachinand Boaz, it is the key to the great arcanum, it is the root of the tree oflife, it is the science of good and evil.To find the exact scale of the analogies in those things which are appreciableby the science is to fix the foundations of faith and thus make off with thewand of miracles. There exists a principle and a rigorous formula, which is thegreat arcanum. The sage does not search it out, for he has already found it: butthe vulgar still search for it and never find it.Metallurgical transformation operates both spiritually and materially throughthe positive key of the analogies.Occult medicine is but the exercise of the will applied to the source of lifeitself, to that astral light whose existence is a fact and whose movement isconfirmed by the calculations whose ascending and descending scale is the greatmagical arcanum.This universal arcanum, the final and eternal secret of high initiation, issymbolized in the Tarot by a naked young girl who touches the earth with onlyone foot and holds a magnetized wand in each hand, and seems to be running intoa crown held up by an angel, an eagle, a bull and a lion. This figure isbasically analogous to the cherub of Yehesqiel, whose drawing we provide, as theIndian symbol of Ardhanari, analogue of the Ado-naï of Yehesqiel, who isvulgarly called Ezekiel.The understanding of this drawing is the key to all the occult sciences. Readersof my book should already understand it philosophically, if they familiarizedthemselves a little with the symbolism of the Cabala. It now remains for us torealize the second most important operation of the Great Work. To find thephilosopher’s stone is something, no doubt; but how do we triturate299[9781101992746_EPUB-28__3.xhtml] it in order to produce the powder ofprojection? What is the use of the magical wand? What is the true power of thedivine names of the Cabala? The initiates know, and those who can be initiatedwill know if through the multiple and precise clues that we have just giventhem, they discover the great arcanum.Why do these simple and pure truths always need to be hidden from men? It isbecause the elect of intelligence are small in number on earth and, in the midstof fools and the wicked, are like Daniel in the lion’s den.300[9781101992746_EPUB-28__4.xhtml]Incidentally, the analogy which the laws of the hierarchy and the absolutescience teach us, being omnipotent, must be the exclusive domain of the mostdeserving. The confusion of the hierarchy is a veritable degeneration ofsociety, because then the blind lead the blind,301[9781101992746_EPUB-28__5.xhtml] according to the words of the Master. Mayinitiation be rendered unto the priests and kings, and order will renew itself.Also, in calling upon the most deserving, and by exposing myself to all thedangers and the curses that surround revealers, I believe that I do a great anduseful thing: I direct towards social chaos the breath of God that lives withinhumanity, and I evoke the priests and the kings of the world to come!A thing is, not just because God wishes it, said the Angel of the Schools; butGod wishes it because it is just. It is as if he had said the absolute isreason. Reason is of itself; it is because it is and not because we suppose it;it is or nothing exists; and how would you have anything exist without reason?Even insanity is not produced without reason. Reason is the necessity, is thelaw, is the rule of all liberty and the direction of all initiatives. If God is,it is through reason. The conception of an absolute God outside or independentof reason is the idol of black magic, it is the phantom of the devil.The devil is death which disguises itself with the worn-out vestments of life;it is the specter of Hiranyakashipu302 [9781101992746_EPUB-28__6.xhtml]enthroned upon the ruins of destroyed civilizations, who hides his horriblenudity with the abandoned rags of the incarnations of Vishnu.HERE ENDS THE DOCTRINE OF HIGH MAGIC."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOTHE RITUAL OF HIGH MAGIC[image/Doctrine_Magic_14.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE RITUAL OF HIGH MAGICDo you know the old queen of the world, who continually walks without evertiring?All debauched passions, all egoistic pleasures, all the unbridled forces ofhumanity, and all its tyrannical weaknesses precede the avaricious proprietor ofour valley of suffering, and, with sickles in hand, her untiring minions performtheir eternal harvest.The queen is as old as time, but she hides her skeleton under the remains of thebeauty of women from whom she steals away their youth and their loves.Her head is adorned with cold hair which is not her own. From the hair ofBerenice, all brilliant with stars, to the hairs, whitened before their time,that the executioner cut from the head of Marie Antoinette, the spoliator ofcrowned foreheads has decorated herself with the remains of queens.Her body is pale and icy, and is covered with tarnished jewels and tatteredshrouds.Her bony hands, overloaded with rings, hold diadems and chains, scepters andbones, gemstones and ashes.When she passes, doors open of their own accord; she enters and goes throughwalls, she penetrates right up to the alcove of the kings, she comes to surprisethe spoliators of the poor in their most secret orgies, she sits at their tableand pours them drink, sneers at their songs with her gum-less teeth, and takesher place as the impure courtesan who hides behind the curtains.She likes to lurk near pleasure seekers as they fall asleep; she searches outtheir caresses as though she were hoping to warm herself in their embrace, butshe freezes all whom she touches and is never warmed herself. Sometimes,however, she seems taken by a giddiness; she no longer walks about slowly; sheruns, and if her feet are not fast enough, she squeezes the flanks of a palehorse between her thighs and heads off breathlessly through the multitudes. Withher gallops Murder on a red horse; wildfires, spreading from its smoking mane,fly before it, as it flaps its red and black wings, and Famine and Pestilencefollow behind it, step for step, on sick and scrawny horses, gathering the rareears of wheat she had forgotten in order to complete her harvest.Behind this funereal cortege, come two small children shining with smiles andlife, the intelligence and love of the century to come, the double genius ofhumanity, which will soon be born.In front of them, the shadows of death spread like the night before the stars ofdawn; the children skim over the earth upon light feet, and with laden handsthey sow the hope of another year.But merciless and terrible death will no longer appear, to harvest like drygrass the ripe ears of wheat in the century to come; she will cede her place tothe angel of progress, who will softly detach souls from their mortal chains, toallow them to rise up to God.When men will know how to live, they will no longer die; they will transformlike the chrysalis which becomes a shining butterfly.The terrors of death are the daughters of our ignorance, and death itself isonly so hideous due to the remains with which she covers herself and the sombercolors with which we surround her images. Death is truly the work of life.There is in nature a force which does not die, and that force continuallytransforms beings in order to conserve them.That force is reason, or the Verb of nature.There exists in man a force analogous to that of nature, and that force isreason, or the Verb of man.The Verb of man is the expression of his will directed by reason.This Verb is all powerful when it is reasonable, because then it is analogous tothe actual Verb of God.Through the Verb of his reason, man becomes the conqueror of life and cantriumph over death.The entire life of man is nothing but the birthing or the abortion of his Verb.Human beings who die without having understood and without having formulated thespeech of reason, die without eternal hope.To fight with favor against the phantom of death, one must identify with therealities of life.What does God care for a premature fetus who dies, since life is eternal?What does nature care for a madness which kills, since reason always lives andconserves the keys to life?The terrible and just power which eternally kills fetuses was called, by theHebrews, Samael; by the Orientals, Satan; and by the Latins, Lucifer.The Lucifer of the Cabala is not a cursed and stricken angel, he is the angelwhich brings light and regenerates by burning; he is to the angels of peace thatwhich the comet is to the peaceful stars of the constellations of spring.The fixed star is beautiful, radiant, and calm; she drinks the celestial aromasand looks upon her sisters with love; dressed in her splendid robe and with herforehead decorated with diamonds, she smiles and sings her canticle of themorning and the evening; she enjoys an eternal rest which nothing can trouble,and she walks solemnly without leaving the position assigned to her among thesentinels of light.The errant comet, however, all bloody and disheveled, rushes up from the depthsof the heavens; she dashes across the peaceful spheres like a war chariotbetween the ranks of a procession of virgins; she dares to confront the burningsword of the guardians of the sun, and like a frantic wife looking for thehusband she dreamed of during her nights as a widow, she penetrates right intothe tabernacle of the king of daytime; then she escapes, exhaling the fireswhich devour her and dragging behind her a long blaze. The stars pale at herapproach, the constellations of sheep, which graze on the flowers of light inthe vast countryside of the sky, seem to run from her terrible breath. The greatcouncil of the stars is assembled, and their consternation is universal: themost beautiful of the fixed stars is at last given the task of speaking in thename of all the heavens, to offer peace to the vagabond messenger.“My sister,” she says, “why do you trouble the harmony of our spheres? How havewe wronged you, and why, instead of wandering haphazardly, don’t you fixyourself like us at your position in the court of the sun? Why don’t you comesing the evening hymn with us, dressed like us in a white robe, which isattached at our chests with a diamond clip? Why do you float about, across thevapors of the night, your hair flowing with fiery perspiration? O! if you took aplace among the daughters of the heavens, how beautiful you would appear! Yourface would no longer be inflamed by the fatigue of your incredible racing; youreyes would be pure, and your smiling face would be white and vermillion likethat of my happy sisters; all the stars would know you, and, rather than fearingyour passage, they would rejoice at your approach, because you would be unitedwith us by the indestructible links of universal harmony, and your peacefulexistence would be but only one voice more in the canticle of infinite love.”And the comet then answers the fixed star:“Do not believe, my dear sister! that I wander about in search of adventure andtrouble the harmony of the stars; God has traced my path like he has yours, andif my course appears uncertain and wandering, it is because your rays do notextend far enough to be able to embrace the contour of the ellipse which wasgiven to me as my career. My flaming hair is the beacon of God; I am themessenger of the suns, and I dip into their fires in order to share them alongmy route with young worlds who do not yet have enough warmth and with agingstars who are cold in their solitude. If I tire in my long voyages, if I have aless graceful beauty than yours, if my finery is less virginal, I amnonetheless, like you, a noble daughter of the heavens. Leave to me the secretof my terrible destiny, leave to me the horror which surrounds me, and curse meif you cannot understand me; it shall not stop me from completing the work whichhas been imposed upon me, and I shall continue my course under the impulsion ofthe breath of God! Happy are the stars who rest and shine like young queens inthe peaceful society of the universe! I am the outcast who always travels andwhose patrimony is the infinite. They accuse me of setting fire to the planetswhich I warm, and of frightening the stars that I light up; they blame me fortroubling the harmony of the universe because I do not turn about theirparticular centers, and because I link them to each other by fixing my gazetowards the unique center of all the suns. Be reassured therefore, my beautifulfixed star, I do not come to take away your peaceful light; on the contrary, itis for you that I exhaust my life and my heat. May I disappear from the skieswhen I will have consumed myself; my end will then be rather beautiful! Knowthat in the temple of God there burn different fires, who all render glory untohim; you are the light of the golden chandeliers, and my flame is that ofsacrifice: let us each accomplish our destinies.”After finishing her speech, the comet shakes her mane, protects herself with herardent shield, and dives into infinite space, where she seems to disappearforever.It is thus that Lucifer appears and disappears in the allegorical stories of theBible.One day, it is said in the Book of Job, the sons of God gathered before theLord, and among them was also found Satan.303 [9781101992746_EPUB-30_fn.xhtml]And the Lord said unto him: Whence comest thou?And he answered: From going to and fro in the Earth, and walking up and down init.Here is how a Gnostic gospel, found in the Orient by a scholarly traveler who isamong my friends, explains, to the benefit of Luciferian symbolism, the genesisof light:Truth which knows itself is living thought. Truth is the thought within it; andformulated thought is speech. When eternal thought searched for a form, it said:“Let there be light.”And this thought which speaks, is the Verb; and the Verb says “Let there belight” because the Verb itself is the light of spirit.The uncreated light, which is the divine Verb, shines out because it wishes tobe seen; and when it says: “Let there be light!” she commands eyes to open, andhe creates intelligent beings.And when God said: “Let there be light!” Intelligence was created and lightappeared.And the intelligence which God had poured forth with the breath from his mouth,like a star which detaches itself from the sun, took the form of a splendidangel, and the heavens greeted it with the name of Lucifer.Intelligence awoke and understood itself completely in hearing those words ofthe divine Verb: “Let there be light!”She felt free, because God had commanded her to be so; and she answered, whileraising her head and spreading her wings:—I shall not be servitude!—Shall you then be suffering? the uncreated voice asked her.—I shall be Liberty! answered the light.—Pride will seduce you, answered the supreme voice, and you shall give birth todeath.—I must fight against death in order to conquer life, answered back the createdlight.God then detached a thread of splendor from his breast which had beenrestraining the superb angel, and while he watched her shoot off into the nightwhich she traversed in glory, he loved the child of his thought, smiled anineffable smile, and said to himself: “How the light is beautiful!”God did not create suffering; it was intelligence which accepted it in order tobe free.And suffering was the condition imposed upon the free being by him who alonecannot err because he is infinite.Because the essence of intelligence is judgment, and the essence of judgment isliberty.The eye only truly possesses the light through its faculty to open and to close.If it was forced to be always open, it would be a slave and victim of the light;and, so as to escape such torture, it would stop seeing.And thus, created intelligence is only happy to affirm God through the libertyshe has to deny God.Yet an intelligence which denies, always affirms something, since it affirms herliberty.That is why blasphemy glorifies God; and that is why hell was necessary for thehappiness of heaven.If the light was not pushed back by the shadow, there would be no visible forms.If the first angel had not confronted the depths of the night, God’s birthingwould not have been completed and the created light would not have separatedfrom the essence of light.Never would intelligence have known the goodness of God, if she had never lostit!Never would the infinite love of God have broken out into the joys of his mercyif the prodigal child of heaven had stayed in the house of her father.When all was light, light was nowhere, it filled the breast of God who wasworking to give birth to it.And when he says: “Let there be light!” he allows for the night to repel thelight and for the universe to arise from chaos.The denial of the angel who, in being born, refused to be a slave constitutedthe equilibrium of the world, and the movement of the stars began.And the infinite space admires this love of liberty, which is immense enough tofill the void of eternal night and strong enough to withstand God’s hatred.But God could not hate the most noble of his children, and he only had her feelhis anger in order to confirm her power.And the Verb of God himself, as if he were jealous of Lucifer, also wished todescend from heaven and triumphantly traverse the shadows of hell.He wished to be proscribed and condemned: and he planned in advance the terriblehour when he would cry out, at the zenith of his agony: “My God! my God! whyhast thou forsaken me?”As the morning star precedes the sun, Lucifer’s insurrection announced to naturenewly born the next incarnation of God.Perhaps Lucifer, in falling into the night, dragged with him a rain of suns andstars attracted by his glory!Perhaps our sun is a demon among the stars, like Lucifer is a star among theangels.This is why, no doubt, he remains calm as he illuminates the horrible anguishesof humanity and the slow agony of the earth, it is because he is free in hissolitude and because he possesses his own light.Such were the heresiarchical304 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__7.xhtml] tendencies inthe first centuries.305 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__8.xhtml] Some of them, like theOphites, adored the demon in the form of the serpent; others, like the Cainites,justified the revolt of the first of angels like that of the first of murderers.All these errors, all these shadows, all these monstrous idols of anarchy whichIndia exhibits in its symbols of the magical Trimurti had found in Christianityits priests and worshipers.Nowhere did he speak of the demon in Genesis. It is an allegorical serpent whofools our first parents. Here is what most translators make the sacred text say:“Now, the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field that the Lord Godhad made.”And here is what Moses said:[image/98.jpg][image/99.jpg]Wa-Nahàsh haîah hâroum mi-chol hàîath ha-shadeh asher hâshah Jhôah Aelohim.Which in English means, according to Fabre d’Olivet:“Now, the original attractor (cupidity) was the addictive passion of all theelementary life (the interior resources) of nature, and the work of Jhoah, theBeing of beings.”But here, Fabre d’Olivet passes by the true interpretation, because he isignorant of the great keys of the Cabala. The word Nahash, explained by thesymbolic letters of the Tarot, strictly means:14 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-30_vector-1.jpg] Nun, The force which producesmixtures.5 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-30_vector-2.jpg] He, The recipient and passiveproducer of the forms.21 [image/9781101992746_EPUB-30_vector-3.jpg] Shin, The natural and central firebalanced by double polarization.The word employed by Moses, read Cabalistically, thus provides us with thedescription and the definition of that universal magical agent, which issymbolized in all the theogonies by the serpent and to which the Hebrews alsogave the name of OD, when he manifests his active force, and the name of OB,when he allows his passive force to appear, and that of AOUR, when he revealshimself entirely in his balanced power, as producer of the light in heaven andof gold among the metals.306 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__9.xhtml]This is therefore the ancient serpent who envelops the world and who rests hisdevouring head at the foot of a Virgin, the symbol of initiation; at the foot ofthat Virgin who presents a small, newborn child for the adoration of the magesand receives from them, in exchange for this favor, gold, myrrh, and incense.The doctrine thus serves in all the hieratic religions to veil the secret forcesof nature which the initiate can dispose of; the religious formulas are thesummaries of the words full of mystery and power which make the gods descendfrom the sky and submit them to the will of men. Judea borrowed the secrets fromEgypt; Greece sent its hierophants and later its theosophists to the school ofthe great prophets; the Rome of the Caesars, undermined by the Christianinitiation of the catacombs, would one day collapse into the Church, and remadea symbolism, with the debris of all the cults which the queen of the world hadsubjugated.According to the Gospels, the inscription which declared the spiritual royaltyof Christ was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin;307[9781101992746_EPUB-30_10.xhtml] it was the expression of universal synthesis.Hellenism, in fact, that great and beautiful religion of forms, had no lessannounced the arrival of the Savior than did the prophets of Judaism; the mythof Psyche is a highly Christian abstraction, and the cult of the pantheists, byrehabilitating Socrates, prepared the altars for this unity of God, Israelhaving been its mysterious custodian.But the synagogue disowned its Messiah, and the Hebrew letters were erased, atleast to the blinded eyes of the Jews.The Roman persecutors then brought Hellenism a dishonor which the falsemoderation of Julian the philosopher (perhaps unjustly called the Apostate,because his Christianity had never been sincere) could not rehabilitate. Theignorance of the Middle Ages then came and opposed its saints and virgins to thegods, the goddesses and the nymphs; the profound meaning of the Hellenisticsymbols were less understood than ever; Greece herself, not only lost thetraditions of its ancient cult, but separated herself from the Latin Church; andthus, in the eyes of the Latins, the Greek letters were erased, as the Latinletters were erased in the eyes of the Greeks.Thus, the inscription on the cross of the Savior disappeared entirely, and onlymysterious initials remained.308 [9781101992746_EPUB-30_11.xhtml]But when science and philosophy, reconciled with faith, will reunite into oneall the different symbols, then all the magnificence of the ancient cults willbloom again in the memory of men, by proclaiming the progress of the humanspirit in understanding the light of God;But of all future progress, the greatest will come from he who, in placing thekeys of nature in the hands of the science, will forever enchain the hideousphantom of Satan and, in explaining all the exceptional phenomena of nature,destroy the empire of superstition and stupid credulity.It is towards the accomplishment of this progress that we have consecrated ourlife and passed our years in the most laborious and difficult of researches. Wewish to free the altars by upturning the idols, we wish that the man ofintelligence again becomes the priest and the king of nature, and we wish toconserve all the images of the universal sanctuary by explaining them.The prophets spoke in parables and in images because they lacked abstractlanguage, and because prophetic perception, being the sensation of harmony or ofuniversal analogies, naturally translates into images.These images, taken literally by the vulgar, have become idols or impenetrablemysteries.The ensemble and the succession of these images and of these mysteries are whatwe call symbolism.Symbolism thus comes from God, despite being formulated by men.Revelation accompanied humanity in all the ages and was transfigured by thehuman genius, but it always expressed the same truth.The true religion is one, and its doctrines are simple and within reach ofeveryone.After all, the multiplicity of symbols was but a book of poetry necessary forthe education of the human genius.The harmony of exterior beauty and the poetry of form should have revealed Godto the children of humanity; but Venus soon had Psyche for a rival, and Psychethen seduced Love.309 [9781101992746_EPUB-30_12.xhtml]It is thus that the cult of form must cede its ambitious dreams of the soul,which already embellished the eloquent wisdom of Plato.The arrival of Christ had thus been prepared for, and that is why it wasawaited; he came because the world awaited him, and philosophy was transformedinto belief in order to popularize it.But, freed by this very faith, the human spirit soon protested against theschool which wished to materialize the signs, and the work of Roman Catholicismwas solely to prepare, unbeknownst to it, the emancipation of consciences and tobegin the foundations of universal association.All these things were but the regular and normal development of divine life inhumankind; because God is the great soul of all souls, he is the immutablecenter around which all intelligences gravitate like stardust.Human intelligence had its morning, its full noon shall come, followed by itsdecline, and God will always be the same.But it seems to the inhabitants of the Earth that the Sun rises young and timid,that it shines with all its force at midday, and that it goes to bed tired inthe evening.However, it is the Earth which turns, and the Sun is immobile.Have faith, therefore, in human progress and in the stability of God; the freeman respects religion in all its past forms and does not blaspheme againstJupiter more than Jehovah; he still pays tribute with love to the shining imageof the Pythian Apollo and finds he has a fraternal resemblance with the gloriousvisage of the resuscitated Redemptor.He believes in the grand mission of the Catholic hierarchy and is pleased to seethe pontiffs of the Middle Ages putting religion up as a barrier to the absolutepower of kings, but he protests alongside the revolutionary centuries againstthe enslavement of conscience which the pontifical keys intended: he is moreProtestant than Luther, because he does not even believe in the infallibility ofthe Augsburg Confession, and is more Catholic than the pope, because he is notafraid that religious unity could be broken by the malice of the royal courts.He trusts in God more than in the politics of Rome for the salvation of theunified idea; he respects the old age of the Church; but he is not afraid thatit will die; he knows that an apparent death will be a transfiguration and aglorious assumption.The author of this book makes a new appeal to the mages of the Orient, that theyshall come and once more recognize the divine Master whom they greeted in hiscradle, the great initiator of all the ages.All his enemies have fallen; all those who condemned him are dead; those whopersecuted him have lain down forever, and he is still standing!Envious men joined against him, they all agreed on a single point; divisive menunited to destroy him, they made themselves into kings, and they proscribed him;they made themselves into hypocrites, and they accused him; they made themselvesinto judges, and they sentenced him to death; they made themselves into hangmen,and they executed him; they made him drink hemlock, they crucified him, theystoned him, they burnt him, and they threw his ashes to the wind; and then theyyelled in terror: he was standing before them, accusing them with his wounds andstriking them down with the radiance of his scars.They believe they butchered him in his cradle at Bethlehem, but he is alive inEgypt! We drag him up the mountain to throw him off, crowds of his assassinsgather in triumph already in expectation of his certain death: a cry is heard;is that not him who has just been broken upon the rocks below the precipice?They pale and look at one another, but he, calm and smiling with pity, passesamongst them and leaves.Here is another mountain they have just tainted with his blood; here is a crossand a sepulcher; soldiers guard his tomb. Fools! the tomb is empty, and he whomthey believed dead walks peacefully, between two travelers, on the road toEmmaus.310 [9781101992746_EPUB-30_13.xhtml]Where is he? Where does he go? Warn the masters of the Earth! Tell the Caesarsthat their powers are threatened! By whom? By a poor man who does not even havea stone upon which to lay his head, by a man of the people condemned to thedeath of a slave. What an insult, what folly! no matter, the Caesars will deployall their powers; bloody edicts proscribe the fugitive, everywhere scaffolds areraised, circuses open filled with lions and gladiators, stakes are lit, andtorrents of blood then flowed, and the Caesars, who believe themselvesvictorious, dare to add a name to those which adorn their trophies, and thenthey die, and their apotheosis dishonors the gods they thought they defended.The hatred of the world confuses, in the same contempt, Jupiter and Nero; thetemples whose adulation caused death are overturned onto the ashes of theproscribed, and upon the debris of the idols, upon the ruins of the empire, healone, he whom the Caesars had proscribed, he who had been hunted down by somany sycophants, he who had been tortured by so many hangmen, he alone isstanding, he alone reigns, he alone triumphs!Yet even his disciples soon abuse his name. Pride invades the sanctuary; thosewho were supposed to announce his resurrection wish to immortalize his death, soas to revel like crows in his continually returning flesh. Instead of imitatinghis sacrifice and giving their blood to their children in faith, they chain himto the Vatican, as onto a new Caucasus, and they become the vultures of thisdivine Prometheus. But what does he care for their bad dream? They have onlychained his image; for he, he is always standing, and he walks from exile toexile and from conquest to conquest.We can enchain man, but we cannot keep the Verb of God captive. The word is freeand nothing can contain it. This living word is the condemnation of the wicked,and it is why they wish to kill it; but in the end it is they who die, and theword of truth remains to judge their memory!Orpheus was torn apart by the maenads, Socrates drank the cup of poison, Jesusand his apostles perished in their final ordeal, Jan Hus,311[9781101992746_EPUB-30_14.xhtml] Jerome of Prague,312[9781101992746_EPUB-30__1.xhtml] and so many others were burned, SaintBartholomew’s Day313 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__2.xhtml] and the Septembermassacres314 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__3.xhtml] made their martyrs in turn; theemperor of Russia still has at his disposition his Cossacks, his knouts, and thewastelands of Siberia; but the spirit of Orpheus, of Socrates, of Jesus, and ofall the martyrs always remains alive in the midst of the persecutors who die intheir turn; he remains standing in the middle of institutions which fall and ofempires which are overthrown!It is this divine spirit, the spirit of the only Son of God, that Saint Johnrepresents as standing upright in his Apocalypse, in the midst of goldencandlesticks, because he is the center of all light, holding the seven stars inhis hand, like the seeds of a new heaven, and having his words descend to Earthunder the sign of a double-edged sword.When the discouraged sages fall asleep in their night of doubt, the spirit ofthe Christ is awake and keeps vigil.When the people, weary of the work which they deliver, lie down and nod off bytheir chains, the spirit of the Christ is awake, and he protests.When the blind sectarians of now sterile religions prostrate themselves in thedust of old temples and crawl servilely with superstitious fear, the spirit ofChrist remains awake, and he prays.When the strong weaken, when the virtues are corrupted, when everyone bends downand reduces themselves to looking for some vile pasture, the spirit of Christremains awake, looking to heaven as he awaits the hour of his Father.Christ means priest and king par excellence.The initiator Christ of modern times has come to teach the new kings and newpriests through the science and most of all through charity.The ancient mages were priests and kings.The arrival of the Savior had been announced to the mages by a star.That star is the sign of intelligence which rules, through unity of force, overthe four elementary powers.It is the pentagram of the mages.It is the flaming star of the children of Hiram.315[9781101992746_EPUB-30__4.xhtml]It is the prototype of the balanced light; from each of its points a ray oflight re-ascends.Down each of its points a line of light descends.This star represents the great and supreme athanor of nature, which is the bodyof man.The magnetic influence leaves in two rays from the head, from each hand and eachfoot.The positive ray is balanced by a negative one.The head corresponds with the two feet, each hand with a hand and a foot, thetwo feet each correspond to the head and one hand.This regular sign of balanced light represents the spirit of order and harmony.It is the sign of the omnipotence of the mage.Yet this same sign, if broken or irregularly drawn, represents astralintoxication, abnormal projections and deregulations of the great magical agent,and in consequence enchantments, perversity, madness, and this is what magescall Lucifer’s signature.There exists another seal which also represents the mysteries of light; it isthe seal of Solomon.The talismans of Solomon had, on one side, the imprint of his seal whose figurewe have already provided in our Doctrine.316 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__5.xhtml]On the other side was a seal which was in the following form:[image/Doctrine_Magic_15.jpg]This is the hieroglyphic theory of the composition of magnets and represents thecirculatory law of lightning.We enchain the unruly spirits by showing them either the flaming star of thepentagram or the seal of Solomon, because we thus make them see the proof oftheir madness and at the same time threaten them with a sovereign power capableof tormenting them and calling them to order.Nothing torments the wicked more than the good.Nothing is more odious to madness than reason.But if an ignorant operator makes use of the signs without understanding them,he is a blind man who speaks of the light to the blind.He is a donkey who wishes to teach children to read.If the blind lead the blind, said the great and divine Hierophant, they bothfall together into the abyss.317 [9781101992746_EPUB-30__6.xhtml]One final word in order to summarize this entire introduction.If you are blind like Samson when you shake the columns of the temple, the ruinswill crush you.In order to command nature, one must be made superior to nature throughresistance and training.If your spirit is perfectly free of all prejudice, of all superstition, and ofall incredulity, you will command minds.If you do not obey the forces of destiny, the forces of destiny will obey you.If you are saintly as the Christ, you will do the works of Christ.To direct the currents of the mobile light, one must be fixed in an immobilelight.To command the elements, one must have tamed their storms, their lightning,their depths, and their tempests.One must KNOW in order to DARE.One must DARE in order to WILL.One must WILL to have the Empire.And to reign, one must BE SILENT."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IPREPARATIONSAll intentions which are not manifested by acts are vain intentions, and thewords which express them are idle words. It is action which proves life, and itis also action which proves and certifies the will. It is also said in thesymbolic and sacred books that men shall be judged, not by their thoughts andideas, but by their works. To be, one must do.Thus we will now deal with the great and terrible question of actual works ofmagic. We are no longer dealing here with theories and abstractions; now we cometo realities, and we shall place in the hands of the adept the wand of miracles,while saying to him: do not pay heed only to our words; act on your own.We will be dealing here with works of relative omnipotence, and with the meansof taking hold of the greatest secrets of nature and making them serve anenlightened and inflexible will.Most of the known magical rituals are either mystifications or enigmas, and weare going to tear open for the first time, after so many centuries, the veil ofthe occult sanctuary. To reveal the holiness of the mysteries is to make up fortheir profanation. This is the thought which backs our courage and had us braveall the perils of this work, perhaps the most daring of works that is possiblefor the human spirit to conceive of and accomplish.Magical operations are the exercise of a natural power but are superior to theordinary forces of nature. They are the result of a science and a habit whichexalts the human will above its normal limits.The supernatural is but extraordinary nature or exalted nature; a miracle is aphenomenon which impresses the multitudes because it is unexpected; it ismarvelous, and that which causes marvel, are the effects which surprise thosewho ignore its causes or those who assign causes which are not proportional tothe results. Miracles are only for the ignorant, but since absolute sciencebarely exists among men, the miracle can still exist, and it exists foreveryone.Let us start by saying that we believe in all miracles, because we are convincedand certain, even by our own experiences, of their entire possibility.There are some which we cannot explain, but we still look upon as explainable.From the most to the least and from the least to the most, the consequences areidentically relative and the proportions are progressively rigorous.But to make miracles, one must be outside of the common human condition; onemust either be abstracted through wisdom or exalted through folly, above allpassions or outside of passion through ecstasy or frenzy. Such are the first andmost indispensable preparations of the operator.Thus, through a providential or fatal law, the magician can only exercise hisomnipotence in the reverse direction of his material interests; the alchemistmakes all the more gold the more he resigns himself to privation and the more herespects poverty, protector of the secrets of the Great Work.The adept with a passionless heart alone disposes of the love and the hate ofthose whom he wishes to make the instruments of his science: the myth of Genesisis eternally true, and God only allows those men to approach the tree of sciencewho are abstinent and strong enough not to covet its fruits.You, then, who look to magic as the means to satisfy your passions, stopyourselves along that deadly road: you will only find madness there, or death.This is what was expressed in the past by that vulgar tradition, that the devilends up sooner or later wringing the necks of sorcerers.The mage must therefore be calm, sober, and chaste, disinterested, impenetrable,and inaccessible to all type of bias or terror. He must be without corporealdefects and resistant to all contradictions and all sorrow. The first and mostimportant of magical works is to arrive at this rare superiority.We have said that passionate ecstasy can produce the same results as absolutesuperiority, and this is true regarding success in such matters but not withregard to the direction of magical operations.Passion projects the vital light by force and imprints unforeseen movements uponthe universal agent, but it cannot be held back as easily as it was cast, andone’s destiny is then to resemble Hippolytus dragged off by his own horses, orPhalaris suffering from the instrument of torture he had invented for others.318[9781101992746_EPUB-31_fn.xhtml]The human will realized through action is similar to a cannon ball which neverretreats before an obstacle. It goes through it, or goes inside it and getslost, when it is cast with violence; but, if it is worked with patience andperseverance, it is never lost; it is like the tide, which always returns andends up eating away even iron.Man can be modified through habit, so that habit becomes, according to theproverb, a second nature in him. Through the means of constantly repeated andgraduated gymnastics, the strength and agility of the body is developed or iscreated to a degree which astonishes. It is the same case with the powers of thesoul. Do you wish to rule over yourselves and over others? Learn to will.How can one learn to will? This is the first arcanum of magical initiation, andit was to make sure the very basis of this same arcanum was understood that theancient custodians of the sacerdotal art surrounded the entrances to thesanctuary with so many terrors and illusions. They only believed in a will onceit had proved its worth, and they were right. Strength can only be affirmedthrough victories.Laziness and forgetfulness are the enemies of the will, and it is for thisreason that all the religions multiplied their practices and rendered theircults painstaking and difficult. The more trouble we take regarding an idea, themore power we acquire regarding the sense of that idea. Do not mothers preferthose children who caused them the most pain and cost them the most to take careof? Also, the power of religions is entirely derived from the inflexible will ofthose who practice it. So long as there is a faithful believer in the holysacrifice of the Mass, there will be a priest to recite it to him; so long asthere is a priest who recites his prayer book every day, there will be a pope inthis world.The most apparently insignificant practices, and those that have the leastrelation to the proposed goal, nonetheless lead to that goal through theeducation and exercise of the will. A peasant who wakes up every morning at twoor three o’clock and goes off far from his home in order to gather a sprig ofsome herb before the Sun rose could, while carrying that herb on his person,perform a great number of miracles. That herb would be the sign of his will andwould become by that same will all that he wished it to become in the interestof his desires.To do, one must believe that one can do, and that faith is immediatelytranslated into acts. When a child says, “I can’t,” his mother answers him:“Try.” Faith does not even try; it begins with the certitude of accomplishment,and it works calmly since it has omnipotence at its command and eternity beforeit.You, then, who present yourselves before the science of the mages, what do youask of it? Dare to formulate your desire, whatever it may be, and then go towork immediately, and do not stop acting in the same sense and towards the sameend: what you wish shall be done, and it has already been started for you and byyou.Sixtus V, while taking care of his livestock, said: “I want to be Pope.”319[9781101992746_EPUB-31__2.xhtml]You are a mendicant and you wish to make gold: put yourself to work and neverstop. I promise you, in the name of the science, all the treasures of Flamel andof Ramon Lully.What must be done first? Believe that you can, then act. “Act how?” Wake upearly every morning at the same time; wash yourself in all seasons beforedaybreak at a fountain; never wear dirty clothes, and to that end wash themyourself if you must; subject yourself to voluntary deprivations in order tomore easily deal with involuntary ones; then silence all desires which are notthose related to the accomplishment of the Great Work. “What? by washing myselfat a fountain every day, I will make gold?” You will work to make it. “This is ajoke.” No, it is an arcanum. “How can I make use of an arcanum I do notunderstand?” Believe and do; you will understand afterwards.A person once told me: “I would like to be a fervent Catholic, but I am afollower of Voltaire.320 [9781101992746_EPUB-31__3.xhtml] How much I would giveto have faith!” “Well!” I answered him, “Say nothing more: instead of ‘I wouldlike,’ say: ‘I will,’ and perform the works of faith; I assure you that you willbelieve. You follow Voltaire, you say, and among the different ways ofunderstanding the faith, that of the Jesuits is the one you find the mostdisagreeable yet at the same time seems the most desirable and thestrongest. . . . Perform the exercises of Saint Ignatius,321[9781101992746_EPUB-31__4.xhtml] and then begin them again without becomingdiscouraged, and you will become as believing as a Jesuit. The result isinfallible, and if you have the naivety to believe that such a thing would be amiracle, you fool yourself already by believing that you are a follower ofVoltaire.”A lazy man will never be a magician. Magic is exercised at all hours and at allmoments. The operator of the great works must be the absolute master of himself;he must know how to conquer the attraction of pleasure and the appetite forsleep; he must be as insensitive to success as he is to insults. His life mustbe a will directed by a thought with all of nature at its service, which he willhave submitted to the mind within his own organs and through sympathy with allthe universal forces which correspond to them.All the faculties and all the senses must take part in the work, and no part ofthe priest of Hermes can remain idle; one must formulate knowledge through thesigns and summarize it through the characters or the pentacles; one mustdetermine the will through words and accomplish words through acts; one musttranslate the magical idea into light for the eyes, into harmony for the ears,into perfume for the nose, into tastes for the mouth, and into forms for thesense of touch; the operator must, in one word, realize within his entire lifethat which he wishes to realize outside of himself in the world; he must becomea magnet that attracts the desired object, and when he will have beensufficiently magnetized, may he know that that object will come of its ownwithout him even dreaming of it.It is important that the mage knows the secrets of the science, but he can knowthem through intuition, without ever having learned them. Hermits who live inthe continual contemplation of nature often divine its harmonies and are moreknowledgeable in their simple good sense than doctors, whose natural senses areskewed by the sophistries of schooling. Real practical magicians are almostalways found in the countryside and are often uneducated people and simpleshepherds.There also exist certain bodily types better disposed than others to therevelations of the occult world; there are sensitive and sympathetic natureswhose intuition of the astral light can be said to be innate; certain troublesand certain maladies can modify the nervous system and can make one, withoutrecourse to the will, a more or less perfect instrument of divination; but thesephenomena are exceptions, and generally the power of magic must, and can, beacquired through perseverance and work.There are also substances which produce ecstasy and dispose one to magneticsleep; there are some which get the imagination going with the most lively andcolorful reflections of the elementary light; but the use of such substances isdangerous, because they produce a general stupefaction and drunkenness.322[9781101992746_EPUB-31__5.xhtml] We can use them anyway but in carefullycalculated proportions and in very exceptional circumstances.He who wishes to seriously begin magical works, after having hardened his spiritagainst all danger of hallucination and terror, must purify himself both on theoutside and inside for forty days. The number forty is sacred, and it is thesymbol of magic itself. In Arabic numerals, it is composed of the circle, imageof the infinite, and the 4, which summarizes the ternary by the unity. In Romannumerals, depicted in the following manner, it represents the sign of thefundamental doctrine of Hermes and the nature of the seal of Solomon:[image/Doctrine_Magic_16.jpg]The purification of the mage must consist in the abstinence from all animalpleasures, in a soft and vegetarian regimen, in the privation from all strongliquors, and in the regulation of his sleeping hours. This preparation isindicated and represented in all the cults by a time of penitence and ordealswhich precedes the symbolic festivals of the renewal of life.One must, as we have already said, observe the most strict interior and exteriorcleanliness: the poorest can find water at a fountain. One must also clean one’sclothing with care, or have it cleaned, and the furniture and chamber pots onemakes use of. All uncleanliness attests to negligence, and in magic negligenceis mortal.323 [9781101992746_EPUB-31__6.xhtml]One must purify the air after waking and before sleeping with an incensecomposed of the sap of the bay tree, salt, camphor, white resin, and sulfur, andat the same time say the four sacred words while turning to face the fourcardinal directions.324 [9781101992746_EPUB-31__7.xhtml]One must never speak to anyone of the works one has accomplished, and as we haveoften said in the Doctrine, mystery is the strict and indispensable conditionfor all the operations of the science. One must throw off the curious by lettingthem suppose other occupations and other researches, such as chemicalexperiments for industrial purposes, hygienic prescriptions, the search for somenatural secret, etc., but the decried word “magic” must never be pronounced.The magician must isolate himself when beginning, and make himself scarce toothers, in order to concentrate his strength within him and choose his points ofcontact, but to the same extent that he will be reclusive and unapproachable atfirst we will see him surrounded and popular later on, when he will havemagnetized his chain and chosen his place within the current of ideas and oflight.A laborious and poor life is so favorable to initiation through practice thatthe greatest masters searched it out, even when they could have disposed of theriches of the world. It is then that Satan, that is to say the spirit ofignorance, who sneers, who doubts, and who hates science because he fears it,comes to tempt the future master of the world by saying to him, “If you are theson of God, say that these stones will become bread.”325[9781101992746_EPUB-31__8.xhtml] Men of money then try to humiliate the princeof science by hindering, by cheapening, or by miserably exploiting his work;they break him into ten pieces, so he has to reach out with his hand ten timesfor the piece of bread which they wish him to think that he needs. The mage doesnot even deign to smile at this absurdity and calmly continues his work.One must avoid, as much as one can, viewing hideous things and ugly people,avoid eating at the houses of people one does not respect, avoid all excess, andlive in the most uniform and regulated manner.Have the greatest respect for oneself and see oneself as an unknown sovereignwho consents to being unknown in order to reconquer his crown. Be gentle anddignified with everyone, but, in social intercourse, never allow oneself to beabsorbed in a crowd, and retire from circles in which one cannot take theinitiative in some manner.Finally, one can, and even should, accomplish the obligations and practice therites of the religion to which one belongs. Yet of all the religions, the mostmagical is the one which realizes the most miracles, which rests upon the mostwise reasoning and the most inconceivable mysteries, which has light equal toits shadows, which popularizes the miracles and incarnates God in men throughfaith. That religion has always existed, and has always been in the world, underdiverse names, the unique and dominant religion. There are today, among thepeoples of the earth, three forms hostile to one another in appearance, whichwill soon reunite as one single entity to constitute the universal Church.326[9781101992746_EPUB-31__9.xhtml] I speak of Russian Orthodoxy, RomanCatholicism, and of a recent transfiguration of the religion of the Buddha.We feel that we have been very clear by the preceding that our magic is opposedto that of goetic sorcerers and necromancers.327[9781101992746_EPUB-31__1.xhtml] Our magic is at once a science and an absolutereligion, which, rather than destroying and absorbing all opinion and allreligions, must regenerate and direct them by reconstituting the circles ofinitiates and by thus giving the blind masses wise and clairvoyant leaders.We live in a century where there is nothing left to destroy; but everything isto be remade, since everything is destroyed. “Remake what? the past?” We cannotremake the past. “Reconstruct what? a temple and a throne? To what end, sincethe ancients have fallen?” It is as if you said: My house has fallen due to oldage, what use is there in reconstructing another? “But will the house you buildbe the same as the one which has fallen?” No: the one which fell was old, andthis one shall be new. “But in the end, won’t it still be a house?” What else,then, would you wish it to be?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIMAGICAL EQUILIBRIUMEquilibrium is the result of two forces.If the two forces are absolutely and always equal, equilibrium results inimmobility, and in consequence the negation of life. Movement is the result ofan alternate preponderance.The impulse given to one of the pans of a balance necessarily determines themovement of the other. The opposites thus act upon opposites, in all of nature,by correspondence and analogical connection.The entirety of life is composed of inhalation and exhalation; creation is theplacing of a shadow to serve as a limit to light, of a void to provide room forthe plenitude of being, of a fertile passive principle to support and realizethe power of the active generative principle.All of nature is bisexual, and the movement which produces the appearance ofdeath and of life is a continual generation.God loves the void he created, in order to fill it; science loves ignorance,which it enlightens; strength loves weakness, which it supports; good lovesapparent evil, which glorifies it; the day loves the night and chases it withoutend while turning around the world; love is both a thirst and a fullness whichneeds to overflow. He who gives receives, and he who receives gives; movement isa perpetual exchange.To know the law of this exchange, to know the alternative or simultaneousproportion of these forces, is to possess the first principles of the greatmagical arcanum, which constitutes true human divinity.Scientifically we can appreciate the diverse manifestations of universalmovement through the phenomena of electricity or magnetism. Electricalinstruments, in particular, materially and positively reveal the affinities andantipathies of certain substances. The marriage of copper with zinc, the actionof all the metals in a galvanic battery, are undeniable and perpetualrevelations. May scientists search and discover: the Cabalists will explain thediscoveries of science.The human body is subject, like the Earth, to a double law: it attracts and itradiates; it is magnetized by an androgynous magnetism328[9781101992746_EPUB-32_fn.xhtml] and acts upon the two powers of the soul, theintellectual and the emotive, in inverse manners but proportional to thealternate forces of the two sexes within each physical organism.The art of the magnetizer entirely regards the knowledge and the use of thispower. To polarize action and give the agent a bisexual and alternating force isthe means, still unknown and vainly searched for, of directing the phenomena ofmagnetism at will; but it requires a highly practiced sense of intuition andgreat precision of the internal movements to not confuse the signs of magneticaspiration with those of respiration; one must also perfectly know occultanatomy and the particular temperaments of the persons upon whom one acts.What acts as the greatest obstacle to the direction of magnetism is the badfaith or bad will of the subjects: women most of all, who are essentially andwill always be actresses; women, who love to impress themselves by impressingothers and who manage to fool themselves first when they play their nervousmelodramas; women are the true black magic of magnetism. It will also beimpossible for magnetizers not initiated into the supreme arcana and notassisted by the light of the Cabala ever to dominate this resistant and fugitiveelement. To be master over a woman, one must distract and skillfully fool her byletting her suppose that she is the one who is fooling you. This advice, whichwe provide here especially for medical magnetizers, can also find its place andits application in conjugal politics.Man can produce at will two breaths, one cold, the other hot; he can alsoproject at will the active light or the passive light; but he must becomeconscious of this force through the habit of thinking about it. The same gestureof the hand can alternatively project and draw in what we have decided to callthe fluid, and the magnetizer himself will be forewarned of the result of hisintention by an alternating sensation of heat or cold in the hand, or in bothhands if he is operating both hands at once, a sensation which the subjectshould feel at the same time but in the contrary sense, that is to say with acompletely opposite alternation.The pentagram, or sign of the microcosm, represents, among other magicalmysteries, the double sympathy of the human extremities between themselves andthe circulation of the astral light in the human body. Thus, in drawing a man inthe star of the pentagram, as we can see in the occult philosophy of Agrippa,329[9781101992746_EPUB-32__1.xhtml] we must remark that the head corresponds inmasculine sympathy with the right foot and in feminine sympathy with the leftfoot; that the right hand corresponds with both the left hand and foot, and theleft hand reciprocally, which one must observe in the magnetic passes, if wewish to manage to dominate the entire organism and link all the members to theirproper analogical chains and natural sympathy.This knowledge is necessary for the use of the pentagram in conjurations ofspirits and in evocations of errant forms in the astral light, vulgarly callednecromancy, as we shall explain in the fifth chapter of this Ritual; but it isworthwhile observing here that all action provokes a reaction, and that inmagnetizing or magically influencing others, we establish between them andourselves a current of contrary but analogical influence, which can result in usbeing submitted to them instead of them submitting to us, as often happens inoperations whose object is the sympathy of love. This is why it is essential todefend oneself at the same time as one attacks, so as not to receive through theleft at the same time as one projects from the right. The magical androgyne (seethe figure on the frontispiece of the Ritual) has written on its right armSOLVE, and on the left arm COAGULA, which corresponds to the symbolic figure ofthe workers of the Second Temple, who held in one hand a sword and in the othera trowel.330 [9781101992746_EPUB-32__2.xhtml] At the same time as one builds,one must defend one’s works by dispersing the enemy: nature does nothing elsewhen it destroys at the same time as it regenerates. Yet, according to theallegory of the magical calendar of Duchenteau, man, that is to say theinitiate, is the ape of nature, who holds him by a chain331[9781101992746_EPUB-32__3.xhtml] but who makes him ceaselessly imitate theprocedures and the works of his divine mistress and of her imperishable model.The alternate use of contrary forces, heat after cold, gentleness afterseverity, love after anger, etc., is the secret to perpetual movement and theprolongation of power; that is what coquettish women instinctively sense whenthey make their adorers go from hope to fear and from joy to sadness. To alwaysact in the same sense and in the same manner is to overcharge a single pan of abalance, and the result will soon be the absolute destruction of equilibrium.Perpetual caresses quickly engender satiety, disgust, and antipathy, and thesame is true of cold indifference or a constant severity, which in time causesdistance and discourages affection. In alchemy, a fire which is always the sameand continually burning calcinates the raw material and sometimes causes theHermetic jar to break; one must substitute, at regular intervals, the heat ofthe fire with that of lime or mineral fertilizers. Just so, in magic, one musttemper the works of anger or rigor by operations of beneficence and love; if theoperator holds to a will always extended in the same manner and in the samesense, the result for him will be great fatigue and, soon after, a sort of moralimpotence.The mage must thus not exclusively live in his laboratory, with his Athanor,among his elixirs and his pentacles. As devouring as the regard of that Circethat we call occult power is, one must know how to appropriately challenge herwith the sword of Ulysses and distance our lips in time from the cup sheproffers us. A magical operation must always be followed by a time of rest equalto its length and analogical distraction but contrary to its object. Tocontinually fight against nature, to dominate and vanquish it, is to put one’sreason and life at risk. Paracelsus dared to do so, but even in this battle, heused balanced forces and opposed the intoxication of wine with that ofintelligence, and then tamed that intoxication through physical fatigue, andthat physical fatigue through new works of intellect. Paracelsus also was a manof inspiration and miracles, but he used up his life with this devouringactivity, or rather he quickly got tired of and tore up the cloth: because menlike Paracelsus can use and abuse without fear: they know well that they cannotknow how to die more than they must age down here on earth.Nothing disposes one to joy more than pain, and nothing is closer to pain thanjoy. The ignorant operator is also surprised to always arrive at results whichare the opposite of those he planned, because he knows neither to cross nor toalternate his actions; he wishes to enchant his enemy, and he himself becomesunhappy and sick; he wishes to be loved, and he becomes miserably impassionedwith women who don’t care a fig for him; he wishes to make gold, and he exhaustshis last resources. His torture is eternally that of Tantalus: water alwaysdraws away when he wishes to drink. The ancients, in their symbols and in theirmagical operations, multiplied the binary signs so as not to forget the law,which is that of equilibrium. In their evocations, they always built twodifferent altars and immolated two victims, one white and one black; the male orfemale operator, holding a sword in one hand and in the other a wand, had tohave one foot wearing a shoe and the other naked. Nevertheless, since the binarywould be immobility and death without the equilibrating motor, there could onlybe one or three people participating in works of magic; and when a man and awoman took part in the ceremony, the operator had to be a virgin, ahermaphrodite, or a child. One might ask me if the bizarreness of these ritesare arbitrary and if their unique goal is to test the will by multiplying atwhim the difficulties of magical works. I would answer that in magic there isnothing arbitrary, because all is ruled and determined in advance by the uniqueand universal doctrine of Hermes, that of analogy in the three worlds. Everysign corresponds to an idea and the special form of an idea; every act expressesa corresponding will and thought and formulates the analogies of that thoughtand of that will. The rites are thus determined in advance by the scienceitself. The ignorant, who know not the triple power, submit to mysteriousenthrallment; the sage understands them and makes them an instrument of hiswill; but once they are accomplished with exactitude and faith, they always havean effect.All the magical instruments must be double in number: one must have two swords,two wands, two cups, two braziers, two pentacles, and two lamps; wear twovestments, one on top of the other and of two contrary colors, as is stillpracticed by Catholic priests; one must either have no metal at all on one’sperson or have at least two of them. Crowns of bay leaves, of rue, of mugwort,or of verbena must also be doubled; in evocations, we keep one of the crowns andwe burn the other, while observing as one would an augury the noise it makeswhen crackling and the undulations of the smoke that it produces.These observances are not in vain because, in the magical work, all theinstruments of the art are magnetized by the operator, the air is charged withhis perfumes, the fire consecrated by him is submitted to his will, the forcesof nature seem to hear him and answer him; he reads in all the forms themodifications and the complements to his thought. It is then that we see thewater become troubled and seem to boil on its own, the fire shoot out a greatlight or extinguish itself, the leaves of the garlands agitate, the magical wandmove by itself, and we hear passing through the air strange and unknown voices.It is during such evocations that Julian saw the beloved ghosts of his fallengods and was shocked, despite himself, by their decrepitude and pallor.I know that Christianity has always suppressed ceremonial magic and severelyproscribed the evocations and sacrifices of the ancient world: our intention isnot to give those rites a new raison d’être by revealing the antique mysteriesafter so many centuries. Our experiments, even of this order, were scholarlyresearch and nothing more. We observed the facts in order to appreciate thecauses, and we never had the pretension of renewing rites which have foreverbeen destroyed.Israelite orthodoxy, that so rational religion, so divine and so poorly known,does not disapprove any less than Christianity of the mysteries of ceremonialmagic. For the tribe of Levi, the exercise of high magic was itself considered ausurpation of the priesthood, and it is for the same reason that all theofficial cults have proscribed practical, divinatory, and miraculous magic. Toshow the natural in the marvelous and produce it at will is to annihilate forthe vulgar the conclusive proof of the miracles which each religion claims asits exclusive property and definitive argument.Let there be respect for the established religions but also a place for science.We are no longer, thanks be to God, in the times of the Inquisition and theburning stakes; we no longer assassinate poor scholars on the word of a fewinsane fanatics or a few hysterical girls. We of course agree that we areinvolved in rather curious studies, but not some impossible and senselesspropaganda. Those who will blame us for daring to call ourselves magicians havenothing to fear from such an example, and it is more than probable that theywill never become sorcerers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIITHE TRIANGLE OF THE PENTACLESThe abbot Trithemius,332 [9781101992746_EPUB-33_fn.xhtml] who taught magic toCornelius Agrippa, explains in his Steganographia the secret of conjurations andevocations in a very philosophical and natural manner, but perhaps, for thatvery reason, it is too simple and too facile.To evoke a spirit, he says, is to enter into the dominant thought of thatspirit, and if we raise ourselves morally higher at the same time, we will leadthat spirit to us and he will serve us; otherwise he will lead us into hiscircle and we will serve him.To conjure is to oppose the resistance of a current and a chain to an isolatedspirit: com jurare, to vow together, that is to say to profess a common faith.The more enthusiasm and power that this faith has, the more efficacious will theconjuration be. It is for this reason that newborn Christianity silenced theoracles: it alone then possessed the inspiration and the force. Later, whenSaint Peter grew old, that is to say when the world believed it had legitimatereproaches to make against the papacy, the spirit of prophecy replaced theoracles, and Savonarola,333 [9781101992746_EPUB-33__5.xhtml] Joachim ofFiore,334 [9781101992746_EPUB-33__6.xhtml] Jan Hus, and so many others agitatedin turn the spirits and translated into lamentations and into threats theanxieties and the secret revolts of all hearts.We can thus be alone when we evoke a spirit, but to conjure it one must speak inthe name of a circle or an association, and it is that which is represented bythe circle of hieroglyphics which are drawn around the mage during theoperation, and from which he cannot exit if he does not want to lose, at thatvery instant, all his power.Let us deal clearly here with the main question, the important question: is realevocation and conjuration of a spirit possible, and can that possibility bescientifically demonstrated?To the first part of the question, we can answer that anything whoseimpossibility is not evident can and must be provisionally admitted as possible.As to the second part we say that in virtue of the great magical doctrine of thehierarchy and of universal analogy, we can Cabalistically demonstrate thepossibility of real evocations; as to the phenomenological reality of theresults of conscientiously accomplished magical operations, it is a question ofexperience; and as we have already said, we have witnessed this realityourselves, and with this “Ritual” we allow our readers to renew and confirm ourexperiments themselves.Nothing perishes in nature, and all that has lived continues to live forever innew forms, but the anterior forms themselves are not destroyed, since we canfind them in our recollections. Do we not see in our imagination the child whichwe had known and who is now an old man? Even traces that we believe to be erasedfrom our memory are not so in truth, since a fortuitous circumstance can evokethem and remind us. But how do we see them? We have already said that it is fromthe astral light which transmits them to our brain through the mechanism of thenervous system.On the other hand, all forms are proportional and analogical to the idea thatdetermined them; they are the natural character, the signature of that idea, asthe mages say, and the moment we actively evoke that idea, its form is realizedand produced.Schröpfer, the famous illuminist of Leipzig, cast a terror over all Germany withhis evocations, and his audaciousness with regard to magical operations was sogreat that his reputation became an unbearable burden for him; then he allowedhimself to be carried away by the immense current of hallucinations which he hadallowed to form; visions of another world made him disgusted with this one, andhe killed himself. This story should render those curious about magicalceremonies more circumspect. We do not do violence to nature with impunity, andwe do not play without danger with unknown and incalculable forces.It is due to this consideration that we have refused, and that we will continueto refuse, the vain curiosity of those who ask to see in order to believe, andwe answer them the same way as we answered an eminent personage from England whothreatened us with his incredulity:“It is perfectly within your rights not to believe; as for ourselves, we areneither more discouraged nor less convinced regarding our beliefs.”To those who will come to us and say that they have scrupulously andcourageously accomplished all the rites and that nothing was produced, we shallsay that they would do well to stop there, and that perhaps it is a warning fromnature, who refuses them these eccentric works, but that if they persist intheir curiosity, they have but to start again.The ternary, being the foundation of magical doctrine, must necessarily beobserved in evocations; it is also the symbolic number of realization and ofeffect. The letter [image/9781101992746_EPUB-33_vector-1.jpg] is ordinarilydrawn on Cabalistic pentacles whose object is to accomplish a desire. Thisletter is also the mark of the scapegoat in the mystical Cabala,335[9781101992746_EPUB-33__7.xhtml] and Saint-Martin observed that this letter,inserted in the incommunicable Tetragrammaton, produces the name of the Redeemerof men, [image/9781101992746_EPUB-33_vector-2.jpg], Yeheshuah.336[9781101992746_EPUB-33__8.xhtml] This is what the mystagogues of the Middle Agesrepresented when, in their nocturnal assemblies, they exhibited a symbolic goatcarrying a lit torch on its head between its horns. This monstrous animal, whoseallegorical forms and bizarre cult we will describe in the fifteenth chapter ofthe Ritual, represents nature dedicated to malediction but saved by the sign ofthe light. The Gnostic banquets and the pagan orgies which followed in his honorrevealed enough of the moral consequences the adepts wished to derive from thisexhibition. All this will be explained with the rites, decried and now regardedas mythical, of the great Sabbath of black magic.[image/Doctrine_Magic_17.jpg]In the great circle of evocations one usually draws a triangle, and one must becareful to observe in which direction one points the apex. If the spirit issupposed to come from heaven, the operator must stand at the apex and place thefumigation altar at the base; if the spirit is to rise from the abyss, theoperator will be at the base and the brazier placed at the apex. In addition,one must wear on one’s forehead, on one’s breast and right hand, the sacredsymbol of the reunited triangles, forming the six-pointed star whose figure wehave already reproduced, and that is known in magic under the name of thepentacle or seal of Solomon.Independently of these signs, in their evocations the ancients made use of themystic combinations of the divine names according to the Hebrew Cabalists thatwe have provided in Doctrine. The magical triangle of the pagan theosophers isthe famous ABRACADABRA to which they attribute extraordinary virtues, and whichis figured in this way:ABRACADABRAABRACADABRABRACADABABRACADAABRACADABRACAABRACABRAABRABAThis combination of letters is a key to the pentagram. The initial “A” isrepeated five times and reproduced thirty times, which provides the elements andthe numbers for these two figures:[image/Doctrine_Magic_18.jpg]The isolated “A” represents the unity of the first principle, or of theintellectual or active agent. The “A” united with the “B” represents thefecundation of the binary by the unity. The “R” is the sign of the ternary,because it hieroglyphically represents the effusion which results from the unionof the two principles. The number eleven of the letters of the word add theunity of the initiate to the denary of Pythagoras; and the number sixty-six, theadded total of all the letters, Cabalistically forms the number twelve, which isthe square of the ternary and in consequence the quadrature of the mysticalcircle.337 [9781101992746_EPUB-33__9.xhtml] Let us remark in passing that theauthor of the Book of Revelation, that clavicle of the Christian Cabala,composed the number of the beast, that is to say of idolatry, by adding anothersix to the double senary of ABRACADABRA, which Cabalistically is eighteen, thenumber assigned in the Tarot to the hieroglyphic sign of the night andprofanity, the Moon with the towers, the dog, the wolf, and the crawfish; amysterious and dark number, whose Cabalistic key is nine, the number ofinitiation.338 [9781101992746_EPUB-33_10.xhtml]The holy Cabalist spoke expressly about this subject: “Let him who hathunderstanding” (that is to say the key to the Cabalistic numbers) “count thenumber of the beast, for it is the number of man, and his number is six hundredthreescore and six.”339 [9781101992746_EPUB-33_11.xhtml] It is in factPythagoras’s decad multiplied by itself and added to the sum of the triangularpentacle of Abracadabra;340 [9781101992746_EPUB-33_12.xhtml] it is thus thesummary of all the magic of the ancient world, the entire program of humangenius, which the divine genius of the Gospels wished to absorb or supplant.These hieroglyphic combinations of letters and numbers belong to the practicalpart of the Cabala, which, from this point of view, is subdivided into Gematriaand Temurah.341 [9781101992746_EPUB-33__1.xhtml] These calculations, which nowappear arbitrary to us or of no interest, then belonged to the philosophicalsymbolism of the Orient and had the greatest importance in the teaching of holymatters emanating from the occult sciences. The absolute Cabalistic alphabet,which attaches the primary ideas to allegories, the allegories to letters, andthe letters to numbers, were what were then called the keys of Solomon. We havealready seen that these keys, preserved until our time but completelymisunderstood, are none other than the Tarot deck, whose ancient allegories wereremarked upon and appreciated for the first time, in our day, by the scholarlyarcheologist Court de Gébelin.The double triangle of Solomon is explained by Saint John in a remarkablemanner. There are, says he, three who bear witness in heaven: the Father, theLogos, and the Holy Spirit; and three who bear witness on Earth: the spirit, thewater, and the blood.342 [9781101992746_EPUB-33__2.xhtml] Saint John is thus inagreement with the masters of Hermetic philosophy, who give the name of ether totheir sulfur, to their mercury the name of philosophical water, and to theirsalt the qualification of dragon’s blood or the Earth’s menstrual blood: bloodor salt corresponds by opposition to the Father, azotic or mercurial water withthe Verb or Logos, and breath with the Holy Spirit. But matters of highsymbolism cannot be properly heard except by the children of science.To the triangular combinations one unites, in magical ceremonies, the repetitionof the names three times, and with different intonations. To the magical wandwas often attached a small magnetized fork, which Paracelsus replaced with atrident whose figure we provide here:[image/Doctrine_Magic_19.jpg]Paracelsus’s trident is a pentacle which expresses the summary of the ternary inthe unity and thus completes the sacred quaternary. He attributes to this figureall the virtues that the Cabalistic Hebrews attributed to the name of Jehovah,and the thaumaturgical properties of the Abracadabra of the hierophants ofAlexandria. Let us recognize here that it is a pentacle, and in consequence aconcrete and absolute sign of an entire doctrine, which was that of an immensemagnetic circle, as much for the ancient philosophers as for the adepts of theMiddle Ages. In rendering it in our time, its primordial value through theintelligence of its mysteries, could we not render all its miraculous virtue andall its power in countering human maladies?The ancient witches, when they passed the night at an intersection of threeroads, cried out three times in honor of the triple Hecate.All these figures, all these acts analogous to the figures, all thesedispositions of numbers and characters are not, as we have already said, justeducational instruments for the will, whose habits they fix and determine. Inaddition, they serve to connect together, in the performance, all the powers ofthe human soul, and to augment the creative force of the imagination. It is thegymnastics of thought which are used in the realization: in addition, theeffects of these practices are as infallible as nature when they are done withabsolute confidence and unwavering perseverance.With faith, said the great Master, we could transplant trees into the sea andmove mountains. A practice, even a superstitious one, even a foolish one, iseffective because it is a realization of the will. It is for that reason that aprayer is more powerful if we go and say it in a church than if we say it athome and that it will obtain miracles if, in order to say it in an accreditedsanctuary, that is to say magnetized by the great currents of the crowds of itsvisitors, we travel one or two hundred leagues while begging and barefoot.We laugh at the good woman who deprives herself of a coin’s worth of milk in themorning and who then carries to the magical triangles of the church a littlecandle worth a coin, which she then lights. It is the ignorant who laugh, andthat good woman does not pay too much for what she thus purchases withresignation and courage. The intelligentsia are very proud to pass by whileshrugging their shoulders, they revolt against superstitions with a noise whichmakes the world tremble: what is the result? The houses of the intelligentsiacrumble, and the debris are sold to the suppliers and the buyers of littlecandles, who are content to hear it proclaimed everywhere that their reign hasended forevermore, so long as they always rule.The great religions have only had to fear one serious rival, and that rival ismagic.Magic produced the occult associations which brought about the revolution calledthe Renaissance, but it has fallen to the human spirit, blinded by mad loves, torealize point for point the allegory of the Hebrew Hercules:343[9781101992746_EPUB-33__3.xhtml] by shaking the columns of the temple he buriedhimself under the ruins.Masonic societies know no more about the high reason of their symbols than dorabbis who do not understand the Sepher Yetzirah and the Zohar, on the ascendingscale of three degrees, with the transverse progression from right to left andfrom left to right of the Cabalistic septenary.The compass of the G.·.A.·.344 [9781101992746_EPUB-33__4.xhtml] and the setsquare of Solomon have descended to the crude and material level ofunintelligent Jacobinism realized with a triangle of iron: behold their heavenand their earth.The profaning adepts whose bloody deaths were predicted by the illuminatedCazotte have surpassed in our time the sin of Adam: after having boldly gatheredthe fruits of the tree of science, with which they did not know how to feedthemselves, they threw them to the animals and the reptiles of the Earth. Andthe reign of superstition has commenced and must last until a time when truereligion will reconstitute itself upon the eternal foundations of the hierarchyof three degrees and the triple power that the quaternary fatally orprovidentially exercises in the three worlds."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVTHE CONJURATION OF THE FOURThe four elemental forms separate and specify through a kind of rough sketch thecreated spirits which universal movement releases from the central fire.

Eudes de Mirville, have no other causes.The elementary spirits are like children: they most often torment those who dealwith them, unless one can dominate them through high reason and with greatseverity.It is these spirits which we designate under the name of occult elements.It is they who often determine our disquieting or bizarre dreams for us, it isthey who produce movements in the dowsing wand and knocking sounds on walls orfurniture, but they can never manifest another thought than our own, and if wethink of nothing, they speak to us with all the incoherence of dreams. Theyindifferently reproduce good and evil, because they have no free will and inconsequence no responsibility; they appear to ecstatics and somnambulists inincomplete and fugitive forms. They are what caused the nightmares of SaintAnthony and most probably the visions of Swedenborg; they are neither damned norguilty, they are curious and innocent. They can be used or abused like animalsor children. The mage who employs their cooperation takes upon himself aterrible responsibility, because he must expiate all evil that he might havethem do, and the grandeur of his torments will be proportionate to the extent ofthe power he will have exercised as their mediator.To dominate the spirits and thus become king of the occult elements, one mustfirst submit to the four trials of the ancient initiations, and since theseinitiations no longer exist, one must have gone through analogous ordeals, suchas exposing oneself without fear to fire; crossing over a chasm on a tree trunkor a plank; climbing a mountain peak during a storm; swimming out of a waterfallor a dangerous whirlpool. The man who is afraid of water will never beregenerated by the undines, he who fears fire will be unable to command thesalamanders; as long as we feel vertigo one must leave the sylphs in peace andnot irritate the gnomes, because the inferior spirits only obey a power that hasbeen proven and shown to be their master even in their own element.Once one acquires through boldness and practice this incontestable power, onemust impose the Verb of one’s will upon the elements through specialconsecrations of air, of fire, of water, and of earth, and this is theindispensable commencement to all magical operations.One exorcises the air by exhaling in the direction of the four cardinal pointsand by saying:Spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas, et inspiravit in faciem hominis spiraculumvitae. Sit Michael dux meus, et Sabtabiel servus meus, in luce et per lucem.Fiat verbum halitus meus; et imperabo spiritibus aeris hujus, et refraenaboequos solis voluntate cordis mei, et cogitatione mentis meae et nutu oculidextri.Exorciso igitur te, creatura aeris, per Pentagrammaton et in nomineTetragrammaton, in quibus sunt volunta firma et fides recta. Amen. Sela, fiat.So mote it be.(The Spirit of God moved upon the waters, and breathed into the face of man thebreath of life. Let Michael be my leader, and Sabtabiel my servant, in light andby light.(Let the Verb be my breath, and I will command the spirits of air thereby, and Iwill bridle the horses of the Sun with the will of my heart, and the thoughts ofmy mind and the commandment of my right eye.(I therefore exorcise thee, creature of air, by Pentagrammaton and in the nameof Tetragrammaton, in which is firm will and true faith. Amen, Selah, Fiat, somote it be.)Then one recites the prayer of the sylphs, after having traced their sign in theair with the feather of an eagle.PRAYER OF THE SYLPHSSpirit of light, spirit of wisdom, whose breath gives and takes away the form ofall things; you before whom the life of beings is a shadow which changes and avapor which passes; you who raise the clouds and who walks on the wings of thewinds; you who exhale, and then the space without end is peopled; you whoinhale, and then all which comes from you goes back to you: movement without endin eternal stability, be eternally blessed. We praise you and we bless you inthe ever-changing empire of the created light, of shadows, of reflections, andof images, and we aspire ceaselessly to your immutable and imperishable clarity.Allow the ray of your intelligence and the warmth of your love to penetrate allthe way to us: then that which is mobile shall be fixed, the shadow shall be abody, the spirit of air shall be a soul, the dream shall be a thought. And weshall no longer be carried away by the tempest, but we shall hold the bridle ofthe winged horses of the morning and we shall direct the flow of the winds ofthe evening in order to fly up before you. O spirit of spirits, O eternal soulof souls, O imperishable breath of life, O sigh of the creator, O mouth whichinhales and which exhales the existence of all the beings with the flux and thereflux of your eternal word, which is the divine ocean of movement and of truth.Amen.One exorcises the water by the laying on of hands, with one’s breath, throughwords and by mixing the sacred salt with some ashes which remain in the bowl ofincense. The aspergillus345 [9781101992746_EPUB-34_fn.xhtml] is made with thebranches of verbena, periwinkle, sage, mint, valerian, ash, and basil tiedtogether with a thread taken from the distaff of a virgin; with a handle made ofhazel wood which had not yet born fruits, and upon which you engrave with amagical awl the characters of the seven spirits. Separately bless and consecratethe salt and the ash of the perfumes while saying:UPON THE SALTIn isto sale sit sapientia, et ab omni corruptione servet mentes nostras etcorpora nostra, per Hochmaël et in virtute Ruach-Hochmaël, recedant ab istofantasmata hylae ut sit sal coelestis, sal terrae et terra salis, ut nutrietorbos triturans et addat spei nostrae cornua tauri volantis. Amen.(Let wisdom abide in this salt, and may it preserve our minds and bodies fromall corruption, by Hochmaël and in the power of Ruach-Hochmaël; let the phantomsof matter depart from it that it may become a heavenly salt, salt of earth andearth of salt, that it may nourish the threshing ox and strengthen our hope withthe horns of the Winged Bull. Amen.)UPON THE ASHESRevertatur cinis ad fontem aquarum viventium, et fiat terra fructificans, etgerminet arborem vitae per tria nomina, quae sunt Netzach, Hod et Yesod, inprincipio et in fine, per Alpha et Omega qui sunt in spiritu AZOTH. Amen.(Let these ashes return to the font of living water and become a fertile earth,and bring forth the Tree of Life by the three names, which are Netzach, Hod, andYesod, in the beginning and in the end, by Alpha and Omega, which are in thespirit of AZOTH. Amen.)WHILE MIXING THE WATER, THE SALT, AND THE ASHESIn sale sapientiae aeternae, et in aqua regenerationis, et in cinere germinanteterram novam, omnia fiant per Elohim Gabriel, Raphael, et Uriel, in saecula etaeonas. Amen.(In the salt of eternal wisdom, and in the water of regeneration, and in theashes whence the new earth springs, let all things be accomplished by the ElohimGabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, unto the ages and aeons. Amen.)EXORCISM OF THE WATERFiat firmamentum in medio aquarum et separet aquas ab aquis, quae superius sicutquae inferius, et quae inferius sicut quae superius, ad perpetranda miracula reiunius. Sol ejus pater est, luna mater et ventus hanc gestavit en utero suo,ascendit a terra ad coelum et rursus a coelo in terram descendit. Exorciso te,creatura aquae, ut sis mihi speculum Dei vivi in operibus ejus, et fons vitae,et ablutio peccatorum. Amen.(Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it separate watersfrom waters, so that which is above may be as that which is below, and thatwhich is below as that which is above, to perform the miracles of the One Thing.The Sun is its father, the Moon its mother, and the wind has carried it in itswomb, it ascends from Earth to heaven and descends again from heaven to Earth. Iexorcise thee, creature of water, that you may be for me a mirror of the livingGod in his works, and a fount of life, and an ablution for sins. Amen.)PRAYER OF THE UNDINESTerrible king of the seas, you who hold the keys to the cataracts of the heavensand who enclose the subterranean waters in the caverns of the Earth; king of thedeluge and of the rains of spring; you who open the sources of the rivers andthe fountains; you who command humidity, which is like the blood of the Earth,to become the sap of plants, we adore you and invoke you. We, your mobile andever-changing creatures, speak to us through the great commotions of the sea,and we shall tremble before you; speak to us also through the murmurs of limpidwaters, and we shall desire your love. O immensity within which shall be lostall the rivers of being, which are always reborn within you! O ocean of infiniteperfections! the heights, which you reflect in the depths; the depths, which youexhale in the heights, bring us to immortality through sacrifice, so that we arefound to be worthy of offering you a day of water, the blood and the tears, forthe absolution of our errors. Amen.One exorcises the fire by throwing salt, incense, white resin, camphor, andsulfur into it, and by pronouncing three times the three names of the spirits offire: MICHAEL, king of the Sun and the lightning; SAMAEL, king of the volcanoes,and ANAEL, prince of the astral light; then by reciting the prayer of thesalamanders.PRAYER OF THE SALAMANDERSImmortal, eternal, ineffable, and uncreated, father of all things, who iscarried on a chariot riding ceaselessly on worlds which forever turn; dominatorof the ethereal immensities, where is raised the throne of your power, abovewhich your redoubtable eyes discover all, and your beautiful and holy ears hearall, grant your children’s wishes, whom you have loved since the birth of thecenturies; because your golden and great and eternal majesty radiates above theworld, the heavens and the stars; you are raised upon them, O sparkling fire;there you light up and maintain yourself through your own splendor, and fromyour essence comes the boundless rivers of light which nourish your infinitespirit. That infinite spirit nourishes all things and makes that inexhaustibletreasure of substance always ready for the generation which it works and whichappropriates the forms which you impregnated it with since the first cause. Fromthis spirit also originates those very saintly kings who surround your throneand who make up your court, O universal father! O unique one! O father of thefortunate mortals and immortals!You created in particular the powers which are so marvelously similar to youreternal thought and to your adorable essence; you established them above theangels who announce your wishes to the world; at last you created us in thethird rank in our elemental empire. There our continual exercise is to praiseand adore your desires; there we ceaselessly burn with the aspiration to possessyou. O father! O mother, that most tender of mothers! O admirable archetype ofmaternity and of pure love! O son, flower of the father! O form of all forms,souls, spirits, harmony, and numbers of all things! Amen!One exorcises the Earth by the aspersion of water, through breath and throughfire, with the correct perfumes for each day, and one then says the prayer ofthe gnomes.PRAYER OF THE GNOMESInvisible king, who having taken the Earth for support and who dug the depths inorder to fill them with your omnipotence, you whose name makes the vaults of theEarth tremble, you who make to flow the seven metals in their veins of stone,monarch of the seven lights, remunerator of subterranean workers, bring us tothe desirable air and to the kingdom of clarity. We keep watch and work withoutrest, we search and we hope, by the twelve stones of the holy city, by theburied talismans, by the magnet nail which goes through the center of the Earth.Lord, Lord, Lord, have pity on those who suffer, enlarge our breasts, free andraise our heads, aggrandize us. O stability and movement, O day enveloped by thenight, O obscurity veiled with light! O master who never keeps to himself thesalary of his workers! O silvery purity, O golden splendor! O crown of livingand melodious diamonds! you who carry the heavens on your finger like a ring ofsapphire, you who hide under the Earth in the kingdom of gemstones the marvelousseed of the stars, live, reign and be the eternal dispensator of the richeswhose guardians you have made us. Amen.One must note the special kingdom of the gnomes is to the north, that of thesalamanders to the south, that of the sylphs to the east, and that of theundines to the west. They influence the four temperaments of man, that is to saythe gnomes influence the melancholic, the salamanders influence the choleric,the undines influence the phlegmatic, and the sylphs influence the sanguine.Their signs are: the hieroglyphs of Taurus for gnomes, and they are commandedwith the sword; Leo for salamanders, and they are commanded with the forked wandor the magical trident; the Eagle346 [9781101992746_EPUB-34__1.xhtml] for thesylphs, and they are commanded with the sacred pentacles; and finally Aquariusfor the undines, and they are evoked with the cup of libations. Their respectivesovereigns are Ghob for the gnomes, Djinn for the salamanders, Paralda for thesylphs, and Nichsa for the undines.When an elemental spirit comes to torment or even trouble the inhabitants ofthis world, one must conjure it by air, by water, by fire, and by earth, bybreathing and sprinkling, by burning the perfumes, and by drawing on the groundthe star of Solomon and the sacred pentagram. These figures must be perfectlyregular and made with care using the coals from the consecrated fire or with areed dipped in diverse colors, which one mixes with crushed magnetite. Then,while holding the pentacle of Solomon in your hand and taking in turn the sword,the wand, and the cup in the other, we pronounce aloud in these terms theConjuration of the Four:Caput mortuum, imperet tibi Dominus per vivum et devotum serpentum.Cherub, imperet tibi Dominus per Adam Jotchavah! Aquila errans, imperet tibiDominus per alas Tauri. Serpens, imperet tibi Dominus tetragrammaton per angelumet leonem!Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Anael!FLUAT UDOR per spiritum Elohim.MANEAT TERRA per Adam IOT-CHAVAH.FIAT FIRMAMENTUM per IAHUVEHU-ZEBAOTH.FIAT JUDICIUM per ignem in virtute MICHAEL.(Dead Head, may the Lord command thee by the living and consecrated serpent.(Cherub, may the Lord command thee by Adam Jotchavah! Wandering eagle, may theLord command thee by the wings of the Bull. Serpent, may the Lord Tetragrammatoncommand thee by the angel and the lion!(Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Anael!(LET MOISTURE FLOW by the spirit of Elohim.(LET THE EARTH REMAIN by Adam IOT-CHAVAH.(LET THE FIRMAMENT BE by IAHUVEHU-ZEBAOTH.(LET JUSTICE BE by fire in the power of MICHAEL).Angel with the dead eyes, obey or drown thyself in this holy water.Winged Taurus, work, or return to the earth if thou dost not wish me to makethee kneel before this sword.Enchained Eagle, obey this sign, or withdraw thyself before this breath.Shifting Serpent, crawl to my feet, or be tormented by the sacred fire andevaporate thyself with these perfumes that I burn.May the water return to the water; may the fire burn; may the air circulate; maythe earth fall onto the earth by virtue of the pentagram, which is the star ofthe morning, and in the name of the Tetragrammaton, which is written upon thecenter of the cross of light. Amen.The sign of the cross which was adopted by the Christians does not belongexclusively to them. It is also Cabalistic and represents the oppositions andthe quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We can see with the occult verse ofthe Lord’s Prayer that we indicated in our Doctrine that there were originallytwo manners of saying it, or at least two formulas very different from oneanother to characterize it: one reserved for the priests and for initiates; theother given to neophytes and to the profane. Thus, for example, the initiate, inbringing his hand to his forehead, said: To you; and then added: belongs; andcontinued while bringing his hand to his chest: the kingdom: then to the leftshoulder: justice; to the right shoulder: and mercy. Then one joins the twohands while adding: in the generative cycles. In Latin, Tibi sunt Malchut etGevurah et Hesed per aeonas. The sign of the cross is absolutely andmagnificently Cabalistic, which the profanations of Gnosticism caused to be lostcompletely to the militant and official Church.This sign done in this manner must precede and end the conjuration of the four.In order to subdue and subjugate the elementary spirits, one must never abandononeself to the faults which characterize them. Thus a light and capriciousspirit will never govern the sylphs. A soft, cold, and unpredictable nature willnever be mistress of the undines; anger irritates the salamanders, and tactlessgreed renders he who attempts to subjugate them, the toy of the gnomes.But one must be prompt and active like the sylphs, flexible and attentive toimages like the undines, energetic and strong like the salamanders, laboriousand patient like the gnomes; in one word, one must vanquish with their strengthsand never allow oneself to be subdued by their weaknesses. When one is wellreinforced in this disposition, the entire world shall be in service to the wiseoperator. He will pass through a storm, and the rain will not touch his head;the wind will not even disturb a fold of his clothes; he will cross through firewithout being burned; he will walk on water, and he will see the diamonds rightthrough the thickness of the Earth. These promises, which might seem hyperbolic,are only so for vulgar intelligence; because if the sage does not do thesethings which these words express materially and precisely, he will do thingsmuch greater and more admirable. However, it is indubitable that one can byone’s will direct the elements in a certain measure and really change or stoptheir effects.Why, for example, if it is observed that people in a state of ecstasymomentarily lose their weight, could we not walk or glide on water? Theconvulsionaries of Saint-Médard felt neither fire nor steel and solicited themost violent attacks and the most incredible tortures as though they werehelpful. Are not the strange ascensions and prodigious balance of certainsomnambulists a revelation of the hidden forces of nature? But we live in acentury where we do not have the courage to admit to miracles of which we arewitnesses, and if someone says: “I saw,” or, “I myself did the things which Itell you about,” they would say to him: “You wish to amuse yourself at ourexpense, or you are sick.” It is better to remain silent and to act.The metals which correspond to the four elementary forms are gold and silver forair, mercury for water, iron and copper for fire, and lead for earth. Onecomposes the talismans as related to the forces they represent and to theeffects one intends to obtain.Divination with the four elementary forms, which are called aeromancy,hydromancy, pyromancy, and geomancy, is done in diverse manners, which alldepend on the will and on the translucent, or the imagination, of the operator.Thus the four elements are but instruments for aiding second sight.Second sight is the faculty to see in the astral light.This second sight is as natural as first sight, or sensible and ordinary sight,but it can only be operated through the abstraction of the senses.Somnambulists and ecstatics naturally benefit from second sight, but that sightis more lucid when the abstraction is more complete.Abstraction is produced through astral intoxication, that is to say anoverabundance of light which completely saturates and in consequence renders thenervous instrument inert.Sanguine temperaments are more disposed to aeromancy, the bilious to pyromancy,the pituitous to hydromancy, and the melancholic to geomancy.Aeromancy is confirmed by oneiromancy, or divination through dreams; oneconfirms pyromancy through magnetism, and geomancy through cartomancy. These aretranspositions and improvements of method.But divination, of any type that we can perform, is dangerous, or at the leastuseless, because it discourages the will and in consequence hinders liberty andtires the nervous system."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VTHE FLAMING PENTAGRAMWe now arrive at the explanation and the consecration of the holy and mysteriouspentagram.Here the ignorant and the superstitious may shut this book: they will only seeshadows or will be scandalized.The pentagram, which in the Gnostic schools we call the flaming star,347[9781101992746_EPUB-35_fn.xhtml] is the sign of omnipotence and intellectualautocracy.It is the star of the mages; it is the sign of the Verb made flesh; and,following the direction of its rays, this absolute symbol in magic representsgood or evil, order or disorder, the blessed lamb of Ormus348[9781101992746_EPUB-35__1.xhtml] and of Saint John or the cursed goat of Mendes.It is initiation or profanation; it is Lucifer or Vesper,349[9781101992746_EPUB-35__2.xhtml] the star of the morning or of the evening.It is Mary or Lilith; it is victory or death; it is the light or the night.The pentagram, when pointing two of its rays upwards, represents Satan or thegoat of the Sabbath, and it represents the Savior when it points a single rayupwards.The pentagram is the figure of the human body with four members and a singlepoint which must represent the head.A human figure head downwards naturally represents the demon, that is to say thesubversion of the intellect, disorder or madness.Yet if magic is a reality, if the occult science is the true law of the threeworlds, this absolute sign, this sign which is as ancient as history and evenbeyond history, must exercise and exercises in effect, an incalculable influenceupon the spirits which are released from their material envelope.The sign of the pentagram is also called the sign of the microcosm, and itrepresents what the Cabalists of the book Zohar called the Microprosopus.350[9781101992746_EPUB-35__3.xhtml]The complete understanding of the pentagram is the key to the two worlds. It isphilosophy and absolute natural science.The sign of the pentagram must be composed of the seven metals or at least bedrawn with pure gold on white marble.We can also draw it with vermilion on the skin of a lamb without defect orblemish, symbol of integrity and of light.The marble must be virgin, that is to say never having been previously made useof for other things; the skin of the lamb must be prepared under the auspices ofthe Sun.The lamb must have had its throat cut during Easter with a new knife, and theskin must have been salted with salt consecrated through magical operations.Any negligence regarding a single one of these ceremonies, which seem difficultand arbitrary, will abort the entire success of any great work of science.One consecrates the pentagram with the four elements: one breathes five timesupon the magical figure; one sprays it with consecrated water; one dries it bythe smoke of the five perfumes, which are incense, myrrh, aloe, sulfur, andcamphor, to which one can add a bit of white resin and ambergris; one blows fivetimes, while pronouncing the names of the five spirits, who are Gabriel,Raphael, Anael, Samael, and Oriphiel; then one places the pentacle on theground, facing the north, then south towards the orient, the occident, andtowards the center of the astronomical cross, and one pronounces one afteranother the letters of the sacred Tetragrammaton; then one says in a loweredvoice the blessed names of the Aleph and the mysterious Tau reunited in theCabalistic name of AZOTH.The pentagram must be placed on the altar of incense and under the tripod ofevocations. The operator must also wear the figure on himself along with that ofthe macrocosm, that is to say the six-pointed star, composed of two crossed andsuperimposed triangles.When one evokes a spirit of the light, one must turn the head of the star, thatis to say one of its points, towards the tripod of evocation and the twoinferior points towards the altar of incense. One does the contrary if it is fora spirit of darkness; but the operator must then take care to hold the end ofthe wand or the point of the sword over the head of the pentagram.We have already said that signs are the active verb of the will. Yet the willmust provide its complete verb in order to be transformed into action, and asingle negligence, representing an idle or doubting word, strikes the entireoperation with falsehood and powerlessness, and turns all the forces which werespent in vain back against the operator.One must thus absolutely abstain from magical ceremonies or accomplish them allscrupulously and exactly!The pentagram drawn with luminous lines on glass through the means of anelectrical machine also exerts a great influence over the spirits and terrifiesphantoms.The ancient magicians drew the sign of the pentagram on the threshold of theirdoor to stop evil spirits from entering and to keep good spirits from leaving.This constraint resulted from the direction in which the rays of the star werepointing. Two points towards the outside repelled evil spirits; two pointstowards the inside kept them prisoner; a single point towards the insidecaptured good spirits.All these magical theories, based on the unique doctrine of Hermes and on theanalogical inductions of the science, have always been confirmed by ecstaticvisions and by the convulsions of cataleptics said to be possessed by spirits.The G which the Freemasons place in the middle of the flaming star signifiesGNOSIS and GENERATION, the two sacred words of the ancient Cabala. They alsomean GRAND ARCHITECT, because the pentagram, from whichever way we look at it,represents an A.In disposing it in a manner such that two of its points are above and one singlepoint is below, we can see the horns, the ears, and the beard of the hieraticgoat of Mendes, and it becomes the sign of infernal evocations.The allegorical star of the mages is nothing other than the mysteriouspentagram; and those three kings, children of Zoroaster, led by the flaming starto the cradle of the microcosmic God,351 [9781101992746_EPUB-35__4.xhtml]suffice to prove the entirely Cabalistic and truly magical origins of Christiandoctrine. One of the kings is white, the other is black, and the third is brown.The white offers gold, symbol of life and the light; the black offers myrrh,image of death and the night; the brown presents frankincense, emblem of thedivinity of the doctrine which conciliates the two principles; then they returnto their country by another road, to show that a new cult is but a new road forbringing humanity to the unique religion, that of the sacred ternary and theradiant pentagram, the only eternal Catholicism.In the Book of Revelation, Saint John sees that same star fall from the sky toEarth.352 [9781101992746_EPUB-35__5.xhtml] It is then called wormwood orbitterness, and all the waters become bitter. This is the striking image of thematerialization of the doctrine, which produces fanaticism and the bitterness ofcontroversy. It is to Christianity itself that we can then address this speechof Isaiah’s: How art thou fallen from heaven, O brilliant star, who wert sosplendid in thy morning?353 [9781101992746_EPUB-35__6.xhtml]But the pentagram, profaned by men, still shines without shadows in the righthand of the Verb of truth,354 [9781101992746_EPUB-35__7.xhtml] and theinspirational voice assures to him who overcomes that he will be given themorning star:355 [9781101992746_EPUB-35__8.xhtml] the solemnly promisedrehabilitation of the star of Lucifer.As we can see, all the mysteries of magic, all the symbols of the Gnosis, allthe figures of occultism, all the Cabalistic keys of the prophecies, aresummarized in the sign of the pentagram, that Paracelsus proclaims as the mostgreat and most powerful of all the signs.After that, should one be surprised by the confidence of the mages and the realinfluence exerted by this sign upon the spirits of all the hierarchies? Thosewho misunderstand the sign of the cross tremble before the aspect of the star ofthe microcosm. The mage, on the contrary, when he feels his will weakening,looks upon the symbol, takes it in his right hand, and feels armed withintellectual omnipotence, as long as he is truly a king worthy of being led bythe star to the cradle of divine realization; as long as he knows, he dares, hewills, and remains silent; as long as he is aware of the uses of the pentacle,of the cup, of the wand and of the sword; finally, as long as the intrepid gazeof his soul corresponds to those two ever open eyes which the superior point ofour pentagram present to him.[image/Doctrine_Magic_20.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VITHE MEDIUM AND THE MEDIATORWe have said that in order to acquire magical power one needs to do two things:to free the will from all servitude and train it in domination.The sovereign will is represented in our symbols by the woman who crushes theserpent’s head and by the radiant angel who restrains and contains the dragonunder his foot and under his lance.356 [9781101992746_EPUB-36_fn.xhtml]Let us declare here without bandying about that the great magical agent, thedouble current of light, the living and astral fire of the earth was symbolizedby the serpent with the head of a bull, of a goat, or of a dog in the ancienttheogonies. It is the double serpent of the caduceus; it is the ancient serpentof Genesis; but it is also the brazen serpent of Moses,357[9781101992746_EPUB-36__6.xhtml] interlaced with the tau, that is to say thegenerative lingam; it is also the goat of the Sabbath and the Baphomet of theTemplars; it is the Hyle of the Gnostics;358 [9781101992746_EPUB-36__7.xhtml] itis the double tail of the serpent which form the legs of the solar cockerel ofAbraxas; finally, it is the devil of M. Eudes de Mirville, and it is actuallythe blind force that souls must conquer to break free of the chains of theEarth; because, if their will does not detach them from this fatal magnetism,they will be absorbed into the current by the force which produced them and willreturn to the central and eternal fire.All magical work thus consists of freeing oneself from the coils of the ancientserpent, then placing one’s foot on his head and driving him where one wishes. Iwill give you, he says in the evangelical myth, all the kingdoms of the Earth ifyou kneel down and if you adore me.359 [9781101992746_EPUB-36__8.xhtml] Theinitiate must answer him: “I will not kneel down, and you shall crawl at myfeet; you shall give me nothing, but I shall make use of you, and I will takewhat I wish: because I am your lord and master!” An answer which is understood,but veiled, in the answer which the Savior gives him.We have already said that the devil is not a person. It is a force led astray,as his name indicates incidentally.360 [9781101992746_EPUB-36__9.xhtml] An odicor magnetic current formed by a chain of wills is what constitutes this evilspirit, which the gospel calls legion, and which drives the swine into thesea:361 [9781101992746_EPUB-36_10.xhtml] a new allegory for the driving ofbasely instinctive beings by blind forces which can set into motion evil willand error.We can compare this symbol to that of the companions of Ulysses who are changedinto swine by the magician Circe.362 [9781101992746_EPUB-36_11.xhtml]In addition, observe what Ulysses does to protect himself and save hiscompanions: he refuses the cup of the enchantress and commands her with hissword. Circe is nature with all its pleasures and its attractions; to enjoy herone must conquer her: that is the meaning of the Homeric fable, because thepoems of Homer, the veritable sacred books of ancient Hellas, contain all themysteries of the high initiations of the Orient.The natural medium is therefore the serpent, always active and seducing one tothe slothful drives, which must always be resisted and subdued.An amorous mage, a gluttonous mage, a wrathful mage, a lazy mage are impossiblemonstrosities. The mage thinks and wills, he craves nothing lustfully, herejects nothing passionately: the word passion represents a passive state, andthe mage is always active and victorious. The most difficult thing to do in thehigh sciences is to arrive at this realization; when the mage has createdhimself, the Great Work is accomplished, at least in its instrument and in itscause.The great agent or natural mediator of human omnipotence can only be used anddirected by an extra-natural mediator, which is an emancipated will. Archimedesasked for a point of support outside of the world in order to raise the world.The point of support of the mage is the cubic intellectual stone, thephilosopher’s stone of Azoth, that is to say the doctrine of absolute reason andof the universal harmonies through the sympathy of opposites.One of our most fertile of writers and the least fixed in his ideas, M. EugèneSue, has built an entire romantic saga around an individual whom he endeavors torender despicable and who becomes interesting despite the author, because thelatter gives him so much power, patience, audacity, intelligence and genius!363[9781101992746_EPUB-36_12.xhtml] It concerns an equivalent of Sixtus V, poor,sober, and without anger, who holds the entire world wrapped in the network ofhis clever machinations.This man excites the passions of his adversaries at will, destroys them oneagainst the other, manages to always arrive where he wishes to go, and withoutnoise, without flash, without charlatanism. His goal is to bring the worldtowards a society which the author of the book believes to be cruel andperverse, and he spares nothing to do so: he is poorly housed, poorly dressed,is fed like the poorest of the poor, but he is always attentive to his work. Theauthor, in order to remain within his intentions, represents him as poor, dirty,hideous, disgusting to the touch, horrible to see. But if the actual exterior isa manner of disguising action and more surely succeeding, is it not the proof ofsublime courage?When Rodin becomes Pope, do you think he will still be so poorly dressed andfilthy? M. Eugène Sue had thus missed his mark; he wishes to condemn fanaticismand superstition, and he attacks intelligence, force, genius, and all the greatvirtues of humanity! If there were many Rodins in the Jesuit order, if therewere even a single one, I would not bet on the success of the adverse party,despite the brilliant and maladroit defense of its illustrious lawyers.To will well, to will for a long time, to always will, but to never covetanything, such is the secret of power; and it is this magic arcanum which Tassoput into action in the person of the two knights who come to deliver Rinaldo anddestroy the enchantments of Armida.364 [9781101992746_EPUB-36_13.xhtml] Theyresist as easily against the most charming of nymphs as against the mostterrible and ferocious of animals; they resist without desire and without fear,and they arrive at their goal.The conclusion of all this is that a true magician is more redoubtable thanlovable. I do not deny it, and while acknowledging how sweet are the seductionsof life, while rendering justice to the gracious genius of Anacreon365[9781101992746_EPUB-36__1.xhtml] and all the youthful efflorescence of thepoetry of love, I most seriously invite my distinguished friends of pleasure tonot consider the high sciences as an object of curiosity and never to approach amagical tripod: the great magical works of science are mortal to pleasure.The man who delivers himself from the chain of instincts will first notice hisomnipotence through the submission of animals. The story of Daniel in the lion’spit is not a fable, and more than once, during the persecution of nascentChristianity, this phenomenon reoccurred in the presence of the entire Romanpeople. Rarely does a man have anything to fear from an animal of which he isnot afraid. The bullets of Gérard, the killer of lions, are magical andintelligent.366 [9781101992746_EPUB-36__2.xhtml] Once only did he run a realdanger: he allowed a companion to come with him who took fright, and then,looking at this imprudent man as though he were lost in advance, he took frightas well, but for his comrade.Many people will say that it is difficult and even impossible to arrive at suchresolution, that such force of will and energy of character are gifts of nature,and so on. I do not deny this, but I also recognize that habit can remakenature; the will can be perfected through education, and, as I have said, allceremonial magic, like religious ceremony, has as its only goal to test oneselfand thus exert and habituate oneself to will, to perseverance, and to force. Themore difficult and demanding the practices, the more effect they have: we mustunderstand this by now.If it has been impossible so far to direct the phenomena of magnetism, it isbecause there has not yet been found an initiated magnetizer who is truly free.Who can in fact flatter himself that he is such a one? Must we not continuallymake new efforts regarding ourselves? It is nevertheless certain that naturewill obey the sign and the word of one who feels strong enough not to doubt. Isay that nature will obey, but I do not say that it will contradict itself orthat it will trouble the order of its possibilities. The healing of nervousmaladies through speech, breath, or contact; resurrections, in certain cases;resistance to wicked wills capable of disarming and overthrowing murderers; theactual ability to render oneself invisible by troubling the sight of those fromwhom it is important to escape: all these are natural effects of the projectionor withdrawal of the astral light. It is thus that Valens was struck with ablinding light and with terror, when entering the church of Caesarea,367[9781101992746_EPUB-36__3.xhtml] just as Heliodorus before him, who was struckby a sudden madness in the temple of Jerusalem, and who believed he was beingwhipped and trampled under the feet of angels.368[9781101992746_EPUB-36__4.xhtml] It is thus that the admiral de Coligny imposedrespect upon his assassins and was only killed by a furious man who threwhimself upon him while turning his head away from de Coligny’s gaze.369[9781101992746_EPUB-36__5.xhtml] What rendered Joan of Arc ever victorious wasthe glamor of her faith and her marvelous audacity: she paralyzed the arms thatwished to strike her, and the English seriously believed her to be a magician ora witch. She was in fact a magician without knowing it, because she believedthat she acted supernaturally herself, whereas in fact she disposed of an occultforce, which is universal and always subject to the same laws.The magnetizing magician must command the natural medium and in consequence theastral body which allows communication between our soul and our organs; he cansay to the material body, “Sleep!” and to the astral body: “Awake!” Then visiblethings change their aspect, just as in the visions induced by hashish.Cagliostro possessed this power, it is said, and aided its action throughfumigation and incense, but true magnetic power must do without such auxiliarieswhich are more or less poisonous to reason and noxious to health. M. Ragon, inhis scholarly work regarding occult masonry, provided the recipe for a series ofmedicines capable of amplifying hypnotism. It is knowledge which shouldcertainly not be rejected, but which prudent mages should take care not to use.The astral light is projected through the eyes, through the voice, through thethumbs and the palm of the hands. Music is a powerful auxiliary to the voice,and it is from there that the word enchantment is derived. No musical instrumentis more enchanting than the human voice, but the distant sounds of the violin orthe harmonica can augment its power. We thus prepare the subject whom we wish tosubdue; then, when he is half-dozing and as though enveloped by this charm, weextend a hand towards him and we command him to sleep or to see, and he willobey despite himself. If he resists, one must, while gazing at him fixedly,place one thumb on his forehead between the eyes, and the other thumb on hischest, while touching him lightly with a single and rapid contact, then inhaleslowly, softly exhale a hot breath, and repeat to him in a low voice: Sleep orSee."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIITHE SEPTENARY OF TALISMANSSince the ceremonies, the garments, the perfumes, the characters, and thefigures, as we have said, are necessary in order to employ the imagination forthe education of the will, the success of magical works depends on the faithfulobservation of all the rites. These rites, as we have said, are neitherfantastical nor arbitrary; they were transmitted from antiquity and are alwaysbased upon the essential laws and the analogical realization of both therelationship which exists between ideas and between the forms. After havingspent several years consulting and comparing all the grimoires and all the mostauthentic magical rituals, we have succeeded, not without work, atreconstituting the ceremonies of universal and primordial magic. The onlyserious books which we have seen on the subject are manuscripts and are drawn incharacters of a form that we have deciphered with the aid of the Polygraphiae ofTrithemius;370 [9781101992746_EPUB-37_fn.xhtml] others are entirely inhieroglyphics and the symbols with which they are embellished and disguise thetruth of their images with the superstitious fictions of a mystifying text. Suchis the case, for example, for the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III,371[9781101992746_EPUB-37__6.xhtml] which was never published with its truefigures, and which we have recopied for our own particular use from an ancientmanuscript.The rituals known under the name of the Key of Solomon are numerous.372[9781101992746_EPUB-37__7.xhtml] Many were published, others have remained inmanuscript form and were recopied with great care. There exists a beautifulexample, very elegantly calligraphed, at the Imperial Library; it is embellishedwith pentacles and characters which are found, for the most part, in the magicalcalendars of Tycho Brahe and of Duchenteau. Finally, there exist publishedclavicules and grimoires which are mystifications and shameful speculationsbelonging only in base libraries. The well-known and decried book of our fathersknown under the name of Petit Albert owes all of its writing to this lastcategory;373 [9781101992746_EPUB-37__8.xhtml] the more genuine aspects are onlyfound in a few calculations borrowed from Paracelsus as well as a few figures oftalismans.With regard to realization and ritual, Paracelsus is, in magic, an imposingauthority. No one else has accomplished such great works as his, and for thatsame reason he hides the power of the ceremonies and only teaches of occultphilosophy the existence of the magnetic agent of the omnipotence of the will;he also summarizes the entire science of characters with two signs, which arethe macro- and microcosmic stars. That was saying enough for adepts, and it wasimportant not to initiate the vulgar. Paracelsus thus did not teach ritual, buthe practiced it, and his practice resulted in a series of miracles.We have said how important the ternary and quaternary are in magic. A greatnumber of religious and Cabalistic signs which represent universal synthesis andconstitute the sacred septenary are composed from their union.According to the beliefs of the ancients, the world is governed by sevensecondary causes, which Trithemius calls secundei, and these are the universalforces designated by Moses under the plural name of Elohim, the gods. Theseforces, analogous and contrary to one another, produce equilibrium through theircontrasts and regulate the movement of the spheres. The Hebrews call them theseven archangels, and give the names Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Anael, Samael,Zadkiel, and Oriphiel. The Gnostic Christians called the last four Uriel,Barachiel, Sealtiel, and Jehudiel. Other peoples attributed the government ofthe seven principal planets to these spirits and gave them the names of theirgreatest divinities. All believed in their relative influence, and astronomydivided up the ancient sky between them and successively attributed to them thegovernment of the seven days of the week.This is the reason for the diverse ceremonies of the magical week and for theseptenary cult of the planets.We have already observed that the planets, here on Earth, are signs and nothingelse; they have the influence which faith attributes to them, because they areeven more truly celestial bodies of the human spirit than stars in the sky.The Sun, which ancient magic has always regarded as fixed, could only be aplanet to the vulgar;374 [9781101992746_EPUB-37__9.xhtml] it also represents inthe week, the day of rest, which we call, who knows why, “dimanche,” and whichthe ancients called, and the English still call, the day of the Sun.The seven magical planets correspond to the seven colors of the spectrum and theseven notes of the musical octave; they also represent the seven virtues and, byopposition, the seven vices of Christian morality.The seven sacraments are also related to this grand universal septenary.Baptism, which consecrates the element of water, relates to the Moon; strictpenitence is under the auspices of Samael, the angel of Mars; confirmation,which accords the spirit of intelligence and communicates the gift of tongues tothe true believer, is under the auspices of Raphael, the angel of Mercury; theEucharist substitutes the sacramental realization of God become man with theempire of Jupiter; marriage is consecrated by Anael, the purifying genius ofVenus; extreme unction is the protection of those who are sick and about to fallunder the false influence of Saturn; and the order which consecrates thepriesthood of light, is most especially marked by the characters of the Sun.Almost all these analogies were remarked upon by the scholar Dupuis, whoconcluded that all religions were false, rather than recognizing the holinessand the perpetuity of the unique doctrine, always reproduced in the universalsymbolism of successive religious forms. He did not understand the permanentrevelation transmitted to the human genius by the harmonies of nature and onlysaw a series of errors in this chain of ingenious images and eternal truths.The magical works also number seven: first, works of light and wealth, under theauspices of the Sun; second, works of divination and the mysteries, under theinvocation of the Moon; third, works of skill, of science, and eloquence, underthe protection of Mercury; fourth, works of anger and punishment, consecrated toMars; fifth, works of love, favored by Venus; sixth, works of ambition andpolitics, under the auspices of Jupiter; seventh, works of malediction and ofdeath, under the patronage of Saturn. In theological symbolism, the Sunrepresents the Verb of Truth; the Moon represents religion itself; Mercury, theinterpretation and the science of the mysteries; Mars, justice; Venus, charityand love; Jupiter, the resuscitated and glorious Savior; Saturn, God the father,or the Jehovah of Moses. In the human body, the Sun is analogous to the heart,the Moon to the brain, Jupiter to the right hand, Saturn to the left hand, Marsto the right foot, and Venus to the left foot, Mercury to the genitalia, thespirit of this last planet being sometimes represented by an androgynous figure.In the human face, the Sun dominates the forehead, Jupiter the right eye, Saturnthe left eye; the Moon reigns between the two eyes, at the root of the nose,whose two wings are governed by Mars and Venus; finally Mercury exerts hisinfluence on the mouth and the chin. With these notions, the ancients formed theoccult science of physiognomy, imperfectly rediscovered by Lavater.375[9781101992746_EPUB-37_10.xhtml]The mage who wishes to proceed with works of light must perform them on Sunday,from midnight to eight in the morning, or from three in the afternoon until tenat night. He will be dressed in a purple robe, with a tiara and bracelets ofgold. The altar of perfumes and the tripod of the sacred fire will be surroundedby garlands of bay leaves, heliotropes, and sunflowers; the perfumes will becinnamon, the male incense, saffron, and red sandalwood; the ring will be gold,with a chrysolite or a ruby; the carpet will be made of the skin of lions; thefan will be made of the plumes of a sparrow hawk.On Monday you will wear a white robe striped with silver, with a triple necklaceof pearls, of crystals, and of selenite; the tiara will be covered in yellowsilk, with silver characters spelling the Hebrew monogram for Gabriel, as wefind them in the occult philosophy of Agrippa; the perfumes will be whitesandalwood, camphor, amber, aloe, and the pulverized seeds of cucumber; thegarlands will be of mugwort, of selenotropes,376[9781101992746_EPUB-37_11.xhtml] and of yellow buttercups. You will avoidblack-colored wall coverings, clothes, or objects, and you will wear no othermetal except silver.On Tuesday, a day for operations of anger, the robe will be the color of fire,or of rust or of blood, with a belt and bracelets of steel; the tiara will becircled with fire, and you will not use the wand, but only a magical stylet andthe sword; the garlands will be of absinthe and of rue, and you will wear a ringof steel with an amethyst for its precious stone.On Wednesday, a favorable day for high science, the robe will be green or of areflective cloth of different colors: the necklace will be of beads of hollowglass containing mercury; the perfumes will be benzoin, mace, and storax; theflowers, narcissus, lily, mercurialis annua, fumitory, and marjoram; theprecious stone will be agate.On Thursday, a day for great works of religion and politics, the robe will bescarlet, and you will wear on the forehead a strip of tin with the character andspirit of Jupiter and these three words: GIARAR, BETHOR, SAMGABIEL; the perfumeswill be incense, ambergris, balm, grains of paradise, mace, and saffron; thering will be decorated with an emerald or a sapphire; the garlands and crownswill be of oak, poplar, fig tree, and pomegranate tree.On Friday, the day for operations of love, the robe will be of blue azure; thewall coverings will be green and pink, the ornaments of polished copper; thecrowns will be of violets; the garlands of roses, of myrtle, and olive tree; thering will be decorated with a turquoise; lapis lazuli and beryl will serve forthe tiara and the clips; the fans will be of swan feathers; the operator willhave on the chest a talisman of copper with the character of Anael and thesewords: AVEEVA VADE LILITH.On Saturday, the day for funereal works, the robe will be black or brown, withcharacters embroidered in silk of an orange color; you will wear around the necka medal of lead with the character of Saturn and the words ALMALEC, APHIEL,ZARAHIEL; the perfumes will be of dacrydium, scammony, alum, sulfur, andasafoetida; the ring will have a stone of onyx; the garlands will be of ash,cypress, and black hellebore; on the ring’s onyx you will engrave a double headof Janus during the hours of Saturn with a consecrated awl.Such is the ancient magnificence of the secret cult of the mages. It is withsimilar instruments that the great magicians of the Middle Ages proceeded withthe daily consecration of the pentacles and talismans relative to the sevenspirits. We have already said that a pentacle is a synthetic character whichsummarizes all of magical doctrine in their special conceptions. It is thus theveritable expression of a complete thought and will; it is the signature of aspirit. The ceremonial consecration of this sign attaches the operator’sintentions even more strongly to it and establishes between himself and the signa true magical chain. The pentacles can be equally drawn on virgin parchment, onpaper, or on metals. We call a talisman a piece of metal which has eitherpentacles or characters and which was especially consecrated for a determinedintention. Gaffarel, in a scholarly work about ancient magics, had demonstratedthrough science the real power of these talismans, and confidence in theirvirtue is also so natural that we willingly carry on our person souvenirs ofthose we love, persuaded that these relics protect us from danger and can renderus more happy. We make talismans with the seven Cabalistic metals, and weengrave them, on the favorable days and times, with the desired and determinedsigns. The figures of the seven planets, with their magical squares,377[9781101992746_EPUB-37_12.xhtml] are found in the Petit Albert, as inParacelsus, and are one of the rare serious sections of this vulgar book onmagic. It should be remarked that Paracelsus replaces the figure of Jupiter bythat of a priest, a substitution that is not without mysterious and earnestintention.But the allegorical and mythological figures of the seven spirits have in ourday become too classical and too vulgar for them to be successfully engraved ontalismans; one must have recourse to more learned and expressive signs. Thepentagram must always be engraved on one side of the talisman, with a circle forthe Sun, a crescent for the Moon, a caduceus for Mercury, a sword for Mars, a Gfor Venus, a crown for Jupiter, and a sickle for Saturn. On the other side ofthe talisman there must be the sign of Solomon, that is to say the six-pointedstar made from two superimposed triangles, and at its center you will place ahuman figure for talismans of the Sun, a cup for those of the Moon, the head ofa dog for those Mercury, the head of an eagle for those of Jupiter, the head ofa lion for those of Mars, and the head of a bull or of a goat for those ofSaturn. You then add the names of the seven angels, either in Hebrew or inArabic or in magical characters similar to the alphabets of Trithemius. The twotriangles of Solomon can be replaced by Ezekiel’s double cross of wheels, whichwe find on a great number of ancient pentacles and which is, as we have observedin our Doctrine, the key to Fu Hsi’s trigrams.We can also use precious stones for amulets and talismans, but all objects ofthis type, either in metal or in gemstones, must be carefully enveloped in silksachets of the color which is analogous to the spirit of the planet, perfumedwith the incense of the corresponding day, and protected from all impure glancesand touch. Thus the pentacles and the talismans of the Sun must not be seen ortouched by deformed and distorted people or by immoral women; those of the Moonare profaned by the gaze and the touch of debauched men and menstruating women;those of Mercury lose their virtue if they are seen or touched by salariedpriests; those of Mars must be hidden from cowards; those of Venus from depravedmen and those who have taken a vow of celibacy; those of Jupiter from theimpious; and those of Saturn from virgins and children, not that the regards ortouch of these last two can ever be impure, but because the talisman would bringthem bad luck and thus lose all its power.Crosses of honor and other decorations of the same type are veritable talismans,which increase personal worth or merit. The solemn presentation of them is theirconsecration. Public opinion must also give them prodigious power. We have notremarked enough upon the reciprocal influence of signs upon ideas and of ideasupon signs; it is no less true that the revolutionary work of modern times, forexample, was entirely symbolically summarized by Napoleon’s replacement of thecross of Saint Louis with the star of honor.378 [9781101992746_EPUB-37_13.xhtml]It is the labarum replaced by the pentagram, it is the rehabilitation of thesymbol of light, it is the resurrection of the Masonic Adonhiram.379[9781101992746_EPUB-37__1.xhtml] They say that Napoleon believed in his star,and, if we could have him say what he meant by that star, we would find that itwas his genius: he thus had to adopt the sign of the pentagram, that symbol ofhuman sovereignty, through intelligent initiative. The great soldier of therevolution knew little, but he guessed almost everything: thus he was thegreatest instinctive practical magician of modern times. The world is still fullof his miracles, and the people in the countryside will never believe that he isdead.Blessed and indulgenced objects, things touched by holy images or venerablepersons, rosaries from Palestine, the agnus Dei composed of wax from the Paschalcandle, the annual remains of the holy chrism, scapulars, medals380[9781101992746_EPUB-37__2.xhtml] are all veritable talismans. One of thesemedals has become popular in our time, even those who have no religion put itaround the necks of their children.381 [9781101992746_EPUB-37__3.xhtml] Thefigures are so perfectly Cabalistic that this medal is truly a double andmarvelous pentacle. On one side we see the grand initiatrix, the celestialmother of the Zohar, the Isis of Egypt, the Venus Urania of the followers ofPlato, the Mary of Christianity standing on the world and placing a foot on themagical serpent’s head. She extends her two hands in a manner in which they forma triangle where her head is the apex; her hands are open and radiate, whichmakes for a double pentagram, whose rays all head towards the Earth, whichobviously represents the liberation of intelligence through work. On the otherside of the medal, we see the double Tau of the hierophants, the Lingam with thedouble Kteis or with a triple Phallus, supported by, with interlacing and adouble insertion, the Cabalistic and masonic M representing the set squarebetween the two columns of Jachin and Boaz; below them are placed, on the samelevel, two loving and suffering hearts, and, all around, twelve pentagrams.Everyone will tell you that the wearers of these medals do not attach anyparticular significance to them, but this does not make them any less perfectlymagical, having a double meaning and, in consequence, a double virtue. Theecstatic upon whose revelations this talisman’s engravings were based hadalready seen its existence and perfection in the astral light, whichdemonstrates once again the most intimate connection between ideas and signs,and sanctions anew the symbolism of universal magic.The more importance and solemnity that we place in the confection andconsecration of talismans and pentacles, the more virtue they acquire, as weshould understand based on the self-evident nature of the principles we haveestablished. This consecration must be performed on the special days which wehave noted, with the instruments of which we have provided the details. Weconsecrate with the four exorcised elements, after having conjured the spiritsof darkness through the conjuration of the four; then we take the pentacle inour hand and we tell it, while sprinkling it with a few drops of magical water:In nomine Elohim et per spiritum aquarum viventium, sis mihi in signum lucis etsacramentum voluntatis.(In the name of Elohim and by the spirit of the living waters, be thou unto meas a sign of light and a sacrament of will.)While presenting it to the smoke from the perfumes we say:Per serpentum aeneum sub quo cadunt serpentes ignei, sis mihi (etc.).(By the brazen serpent before which fell the fiery serpents, be thou unto me,etc.)While blowing seven times on the pentacle or on the talisman we say:Per firmamentum et spiritum vocis, sis mihi (etc.).(By the firmament and the spirit of the voice, be thou unto me, etc.)Finally, while placing a few grains of purified earth or salt in the form of atriangle on the pentacle or on the talisman, one must say:In sale terrae et per virtutem vitae aeternae, sis mihi (etc.).(In the salt of the earth and by the power of eternal life, be thou unto me,etc.)Then we perform the conjuration of the seven in the following manner:By turns, we throw into the sacred fire a pastille made of the seven perfumesand we say:In the name of Michael, may Jehovah command you and drive you away from here,Chavajoth!In the name of Gabriel, may Adonai command you and drive you away from here,Belial!In the name of Raphael, disappear before Elohim, Sachabiel!By Samael Zabaoth and in the name of Elohim Gibor, leave this place, Adramelech!By Zachariel and Sachiel-Melech, obey Elvah, Samgabiel!In the divine and human name of Shaddai and by the sign of the pentagram which Ihold in my right hand, in the name of the angel Anael, by the power of Adam andHeva, who are Yod-Chavah, leave this place, Lilith; leave us in peace, Nahemah!By the holy Eloim and the names of the spirits Cassiel, Shealtiel, Zaphiel, andZarahiel, by the command of Oriphiel, turn away from us, Moloch! we shall notgive you our children to devour.Concerning the magical instruments, the principal ones are: the wand, the sword,the lamp, the cup, the altar, and the tripod. In high and divine operations ofmagic we use the lamp, the wand, and the cup; in works of black magic we replacethe wand with the sword and the lamp with Cardano’s candle.382[9781101992746_EPUB-37__4.xhtml] We will explain the difference in this articleparticular to black magic later.Let us now come to the description and the consecration of the instruments.[image/108.jpg]The magical wand, which one should not confuse with a simple divinatory wand orwith the fork of the necromancers or Paracelsus’s trident; the true and absolutemagical wand must be of a single cast, perfectly straight, of almond tree orhazel tree, cut, with a single cut of a magical pruning knife or a goldensickle, before dawn and at the moment when the tree is ready to flower. One mustperforate it along its entire length without cracking or breaking it and inserta long magnetized iron needle which goes through the entire length; then weattach to one of the extremities a polyhedral prism which is triangularly cut,and at the other end the same form but in black resin. In the middle of the wandyou will place two rings, one of red copper, the other of zinc; then the wandwill be gilded on the side of the resin and silvered on the side of the prism upuntil the rings in the middle, and then you cover it in silk up until the theextremities only. On the copper ring one must engrave these characters[image/109.jpg] (IRVShLM HQDSh, “Jerusalem the Holy”) and on the zinc ring these[image/110.jpg] (ShLMH HMLK, “Solomon the King.”). The consecration of the wandmust last seven days, beginning on the new moon, and must be done by an initiatewho possesses the grand arcanum and who he himself has a consecrated wand. It isthe transmission of the magical priesthood, and this transmission has not ceasedsince the obscure origins of the high science. The wand and the otherinstruments, but most of all the wand, must be carefully hidden, and under nopretext should the mage allow them to be seen or touched by the profane;otherwise they will lose all their virtue.The manner of transmission of the wand is one of the arcana of science that isnever permitted to be revealed.The length of the magical wand should not exceed the length of the arm of theoperator. The mage should not make use of it except when he is alone, and heshould never even touch it needlessly. Many ancient mages made it only thelength of their forearm and hid it in their long sleeves, showing only thedivinatory wand to the public, or some allegorical scepter made ivory or ebony,depending on the nature of the works.Cardinal Richelieu, who was always chasing after power, searched all his lifefor the transmission of the wand without ever managing to find it. His Cabalist,Gaffarel, could only provide him with the sword and the talismans: this wasperhaps the secret motive behind his hatred for Urbain Grandier, who knewsomething of the cardinal’s weaknesses. The secret and lengthy interviewsbetween Laubardement and the poor priest just a few hours before his lastordeal, and the words of a friend and confidant of his when Urbain was headingtowards death, “Monsieur, you are a clever man, do not lose your way,” provide agreat deal to think about regarding this subject.The magical wand is the verendum of the mage; he must not speak about it in aclear and precise manner; no one should boast about having one, and one shouldnot transmit the consecration except under conditions of discretion and absoluteconfidence.The sword is less occult, and here is what one must do:It must be made of pure steel, with a handle of copper made in the form of across with three pommels, as it is represented in the Enchiridion of Leo III, orwhich has a guard made of two crescents, as in our figure. On the central knotof the guard, which must be gold plated, one must engrave the sign of themicrocosm on one side and the sign of the macrocosm on the other. On the pommelone must engrave the Hebrew monogram for Michael, as one sees it in Agrippa, andon the blade, on one side are the characters [image/111.jpg] (BAYLYM YHVH KMKH)and on the other the monogram of Constantine’s labarum, followed by the words:Vince in hoc, Deo duce, ferro comite (“Conquer in this [sign], with God as yourleader and a sword as your companion”). (For sincere and exact reproductions ofthese figures, see the best ancient editions of the Enchiridion.)The consecration of the sword must be done on a Sunday, during daylight hours,under the invocation of Michael. You will put the blade of the sword into a fireof laurel and cypress, then wipe and polish the blade with the ashes of thesacred fire, moistened with the blood of a mole or a serpent, and you will say:Sis mihi gladius Michaelis, in virtute Elohim Sabaoth fugiant a te spiritustenebrarum et reptilia terrae (“Let this be unto me the sword of Michael; in thepower of Elohim Sabaoth let the spirits of the shadows and the creeping thingsof the Earth flee from thee”); then you will perfume it with the perfumes of theSun, and you enclose it in silk with branches of verbena, which must be burnedon the seventh day.The magical lamp must be made of four metals: gold, silver, bronze, and iron.The foot will be in iron, the knot of bronze, the cup of silver, and thetriangle in the middle of gold. It will have two arms, composed of three metalstwisted together, in a manner however which allows for a triple conduit for theoil. It will have nine wicks, three in the middle and three for each arm. (Seefigure.) On the foot you will engrave the seal of Hermes and above it Khunrath’stwo-headed androgyne. The lower border of the foot will represent a serpentbiting its tail.On the cup or oil receptacle you will engrave the sign of Solomon. To this lampwill be adapted two globes: one decorated with transparent pictures representingthe seven spirits, the other, which is larger and doubled, capable of containingin four compartments; between two glasses, water which is tinted in variouscolors. The entire lamp will be enclosed in a column of wood that turns freely,which is able to let escape at will one of the rays from the lamp, which youwill direct towards the smoke from the altar at the moment of theinvocations.383 [9781101992746_EPUB-37__5.xhtml]This lamp is of great help in aiding with intuitive operations of slowimagination and is able to immediately create in front of magnetized persons theforms of a terrifying reality, which, being multiplied by mirrors, will cause amage’s chamber to suddenly grow and change it into a single immense room filledwith visible souls; the intoxication of the incense and the exaltation of theinvocations will soon transform this phantasmagoria into a true dream: we willrecognize persons we had known, phantoms will speak; then, if we close up thecolumn of the lamp while redoubling the fire of the perfumes, somethingextraordinary and unexpected will occur."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIIA WARNING TO THE IMPRUDENTAs we have already said several times, the operations of science are not withouttheir dangers.They can lead to madness for those who are not strengthened by a foundation ofsupreme, absolute, and infallible reason.They can overexcite their nervous system and produce terrible and incurablemaladies.They can, when their imagination strikes and terrorizes them, faint and even diedue to cerebral congestion.We can thus never too often deter nervous and easily enthused persons, women,young people, and all those who are not in the habit of having a perfect commandover their fears.Nothing is more dangerous than turning magic into a hobby, like certain peoplewho make it an ornament for their soirées. Magnetic experiences themselves,conducted under such conditions, can only tire the subjects, mislead opinion,and obfuscate the science. We do not play with the mysteries of life and deathwith impunity, and those things which should be taken seriously must be treatedseriously and with great reserve.Never yield to the desire to convince through effects. The most surprisingeffects will not act as proofs for those who are not convinced beforehand. Wecan always attribute them to natural illusions and look upon the mage as a moreor less adroit rival of Robert-Houdin or of Hamilton.384[9781101992746_EPUB-38_fn.xhtml] To demand miracles in order to believe in thescience is to show oneself to be unworthy or incapable of the science. SANCTASANCTIS.385 [9781101992746_EPUB-38__1.xhtml]Nor should you ever boast about the works you have performed, even if you haveresuscitated the dead. Fear persecution. The great master always recommendedsilence to the sick that he cured, and if this silence had been faithfully kept,they would not have crucified the initiator before he had finished his work.Meditate on the twelfth figure of the keys of the Tarot; think of the greatsymbol of Prometheus and remain silent.All the mages who had divulged their works died a violent death, many werereduced to suicide, like Cardano, Schröpfer, Cagliostro, and so many others.The mage must live in retreat and be difficult to approach. This is what thesymbol of the ninth key of the Tarot represents, where the initiate issymbolized by a hermit completely covered by his cloak.Nevertheless, this retreat cannot result in isolation. The mage requiresdevotion and friendships, but he must choose them carefully and keep them at anyprice.To engage in ceremonial magic, one must be without troubling preoccupations; onemust be able to procure all the instruments of the science and know, when theneed arises, how to make them oneself; finally, one must have a privatelaboratory, where one does not have to fear ever being surprised or bothered.Then, and this is the essential condition, one must know how to balance theforces and contain the momentum of one’s own initiatives. This is what theeighth figure of the keys of Hermes represents, in which we see a woman sittingbetween two columns, holding a sword in her right hand and a balance in theother.To equilibrate the forces one must maintain them simultaneously and cause themto act alternatively, a double action which is represented by the use of thebalance.This arcana is also represented by the double cross of the pentacles ofPythagoras and of Ezekiel (see the figure here[9781101992746_EPUB-24.xhtml#image_pageMap_165]), in which the crosses arebalanced one against the other and the planetary signs are always in opposition.Thus Venus gives equilibrium to the works of Mars; Mercury tempers andaccomplishes the works of the Sun and the Moon; Saturn must balance Jupiter. Itis through this antagonism of the ancient gods that Prometheus, that is to saythe genius of science, managed to enter Olympus and steal fire from heaven.Must we speak more clearly? The more sweet and calm you are, the more power youranger will have; the more energetic you are, the more value your leisure willhave; the more skillful you are, the more you will profit from your intelligenceand even your virtues; the more indifferent you are, the easier it will be tomake yourself loved. This is an experience of a moral order and is realizedstrictly within the sphere of action. The human passions are fated to produce,when they are not directed, effects contrary to their unbridled desires.Excessive love produces antipathy; blind hatred is annulled and punishes itself;vanity leads to abasement and the most cruel humiliations. The great master thusrevealed a mystery of positive magical science when he said: “If you wish toaccumulate burning coals upon the head of he who causes you harm, then pardonhim and do him good.”386 [9781101992746_EPUB-38__2.xhtml] We might say that sucha pardon would be hypocritical and resembles a refined form of vengeance. Butone must remember that the mage is sovereign. And a sovereign never takesrevenge, since he has the right to punish. When he exercises that right and doeshis duty, he is as implacable as justice. Let us carefully note here, so that noone misunderstands my words, this is a matter of punishing evil with good andopposing sweetness to violence. If the exercise of virtue is a flagellation forvice, no one has the right to ask that we spare or take pity upon its disgraceand its suffering.He who engages in works of science must exercise moderately every day, abstainfrom staying up too late, and follow a healthy and regular regimen. He mustavoid putrid odors, stagnant water, indigestible or impure foods. Most of all,he must distract himself from daily magical preoccupations with material cares,or works either of art or of industry, or even by his professional duties. Theway to see clearly is to not always be looking, and he who always spends hislife on the same goal will end up by never attaining it.Another precaution one should also always take is to never engage in magicaloperations while sick.The ceremonies being, as we have said, an artificial means of creating habits ofwill, they cease being necessary when those habits are established. It is inthis manner, while addressing only perfect adepts, that Paracelsus proscribedtheir use in his occult philosophy. One must simplify them progressively, beforecompletely omitting them, according to the experience of our acquired powers andour established habits in the exercise of the extra-natural will."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IXTHE CEREMONY OF THE INITIATESScience is preserved through silence and is perpetuated through initiation. Thelaw of silence is thus only absolute and inviolable relative to the multitude ofnon-initiated. The science can only be transmitted through words. Therefore thesages must sometimes speak.Yes, the sages must speak, not to say, but to lead others to find. Noli ire, facvenire,387 [9781101992746_EPUB-39_fn.xhtml] was Rabelais’s motto, who, inpossessing all the sciences of his time, could not have been ignorant of magic.We will thus reveal here the mysteries of initiation.The destiny of man is, as we have said, to make or create himself; he is andwill be the son of his works for the moment and for eternity.All men are called to take part, but the number of the elect, that is to saythose who succeed, is always small; in other terms, men who desire to besomething are great in number, and the men of the elite are always rare.But the government of the world belongs by right to the elite, and when amechanism or some usurpation prevents them from in fact having it, a politicalor social cataclysm occurs.The men who are masters of themselves easily become masters of others, but theycan mutually obstruct each other if they do not recognize the laws of adiscipline and of a universal hierarchy.To submit to the same discipline, there must be a communion of ideas and ofdesires, and one can only arrive at this communion through a common religionfounded on the actual bases of intelligence and reason.This religion has always existed in the world, and it is the only one that canbe called infallible, unfailing, and truly catholic, that is to say universal.This religion, for which all others are just successive veils and shadows, isthe one which demonstrates being through being, the truth through reason, reasonthrough evidence and common sense.It is the one which proves through the realities the raison d’être of thehypotheses independent and outside of the realities.It is the one which has as its foundation the doctrine of universal analogies,but which never confuses the things of science with the things of faith. It cannever be a matter of faith that two and one make more or less than three; thatthe physical contents can be larger than the container; that a solid body, and asolid, can act like a fluid or a gaseous body; that a human body, for example,can pass through a closed door without either opening it or bursting through. Tosay that one believes such a thing is to speak like a child or like a madman,but it is no less foolish to define the unknown and apply reason to it, fromhypothesis to hypothesis, until you are denying a priori evidence in order toaffirm foolhardy suppositions. The sage affirms what he knows and only believeswhat he does not know in the measure of the reasonable and known necessities ofthe hypothesis.But this reasonable religion will never be that of the multitudes, who requirefables, mysteries, defined hopes, and materially motivated terrors.It is for this reason that the priesthood was established in the world. Yet thepriesthood recruits through initiation.Religious forms perish when initiation ceases to be practiced within thesanctuary, either through divulgation or through negligence and oblivion of thesacred mysteries.The Gnostic divulgations, for example, distanced the Christian church from thehigh truths of the Cabala, which contain all the secrets of the higher theology.The blind having become the leaders of the blind, great obfuscations wereproduced, great falls and deplorable scandals; then the sacred books, whose keysare all Cabalistic, from Genesis to Revelation, became so unintelligible toChristians that the pastors, with reason, judged it necessary to forbid thesimple faithful to read them. Taken on their word and understood materially,these books can only be, as the school of Voltaire only too well demonstrated,an inconceivable tissue of absurdities and scandals.This is the case for all the ancients’ doctrines, with their brillianttheogonies and their poetic legends. To say the ancients believed in Greece inthe loves of Jupiter, or adored in Egypt the cynocephalus and the sparrow hawkas living and real gods, is to be as ignorant and as in bad faith as one wouldbe in claiming that Christians adore a triple God consisting of an old man, atorture victim, and a pigeon. The straightforward meaning of the symbols isalways calumniatory. This is why one should first and foremost guard oneselfwell against mocking things one does not understand, when their wording seems tosuppose an absurdity or even some singularity; it would also be just assenseless to accept them without discussion or examination.Before there is anything that pleases or displeases us, there is truth, that isto say reason, and it is by this reason that our actions must be regulatedrather than by our pleasure if we wish to create intelligence within us, whichis the raison d’être of immortality, and justice, which is law.The man who is truly a man can only wish for what he must do reasonably andjustly, and he also imposes silence on his lusts and fears, so as to only hearreason.Such a man is a natural king and a spontaneous priest for the errant multitudes.It is for this reason that the object of the ancient initiations wasindifferently called the sacerdotal art and the royal art.The ancient magical associations were seminaries of priests and kings, and oneonly managed to be admitted through truly sacerdotal and kingly works, that isto say by placing oneself above all the weaknesses of nature.We will not repeat here what is found everywhere regarding the Egyptianinitiations, perpetuated, though in a weakened form, in the secret societies ofthe Middle Ages. Christian radicalism, founded on the false understanding ofthese words, “You have only one father and one master, and you are allbrothers,” struck a terrible blow to the sacred hierarchy. Since that time, thesacerdotal dignities have been bestowed by intrigue or happenstance; activemediocrity has managed to supplant modest superiority, and in consequence ismisunderstood, and, meanwhile, initiation being an essential law of religiouslife, an instinctively magical society was formed with the decline of pontificalpower388 [9781101992746_EPUB-39__1.xhtml] and had soon concentrated in itselfalone all the powers of Christianity, because only it alone had vaguelyunderstood, but positively exercised, the hierarchical power through the trialsof initiation and the omnipotence of faith in passive reverence.What, in fact, did the initiate do in the ancient initiations? He entirelyabandoned his life and his liberty to the masters of the temples of Thebes or ofMemphis; he advanced resolutely through innumerable trials of terror that mightmake him suspect a premeditated plot against his life; he crossed burning pyres,swam through torrents of seething black water, suspended himself over unknownheights, over precipices without end. . . . Was this not blind reverence in allthe force of that term? Is not to momentarily abjure one’s liberty in order toarrive at emancipation the most perfect exercise of liberty? Yet that is whatmust be done and has always been done by those who aspire to the sanctum regnumof magical omnipotence. The disciples of Pythagoras condemned themselves to astrict silence for several years; even the sectarians of Epicurus onlyunderstood the sovereignty of pleasure through acquired sobriety and calculatedtemperance. Life is war, where one must prove oneself to rise in rank: power isnot given; one must take it.Initiation through struggle and trial is thus indispensable for arriving at thepractical science of magic. We have already said how we can triumph over thefour elemental forms: we will not repeat it, and we refer our readers who wishto know the ancient ceremonies to the works of the Baron de Tschoudy, author ofThe Flaming Star, The Masonic Adonhiramite, and several other highly estimablemasonic brochures.We must insist here upon this reflection: that the intellectual and social chaosin the midst of which we perish has its cause in the negligence of initiation,of its trials and of its mysteries. Men for which zealousness was stronger thanscience, impressed by the popular maxims of the Gospels, believed in theprimordial and absolute equality of people. A famous crackpot, the eloquent andunfortunate Rousseau,389 [9781101992746_EPUB-39__2.xhtml] propagated with allthe magic of his style this paradox: that society alone depraves men, as if tosay that competition and the emulation of others’ work rendered workers lazy.The essential law of nature, that of initiation through works and throughlaborious and voluntary progress had been fatally misunderstood; Freemasonry hadits deserters, as did Catholicism. What was the result? The iron level replacedthe intellectual and symbolic level. Is not to preach equality to those belowwithout telling them how to rise, the commitment to descend oneself? As soon aswe descend, we achieve the reign of the Carmagnole,390[9781101992746_EPUB-39__3.xhtml] of the sansculottes391[9781101992746_EPUB-39__4.xhtml] and of Marat.392[9781101992746_EPUB-39__5.xhtml]To lift up a faltering and declining society, one must reestablish hierarchy andinitiation. The job is difficult, but everyone of intelligence already knowsthat it must be done. Should we need the world to go through another Flood forthis to happen? We strongly desire that it should not be so, and this book, thegreatest, perhaps, but not the last of our audacities, is a call to all thosestill living to reconstitute life even in the middle of decomposition and ofdeath."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XTHE KEY OF OCCULTISMLet us now go deeper into the question of pentacles, because in them is foundall the virtue of magic, since the secret to power is in the intelligence whichdirects it.We will not go back to the pentacles of Pythagoras and Ezekiel, for which wehave already given the explanation and the figures; we will prove in anotherchapter that all the instruments of the Hebrew cult were pentacles and thatMoses had written in gold and bronze in the tabernacle and on all hisaccessories the first and last word of the Bible. Each mage can and should havehis own particular pentacle, because of course a pentacle is the perfect summaryof a spirit.It is for this reason that we find in the magical calendars of Tycho Brahe andof Duchenteau the pentacles of Adam, of Job, of Jeremiah, of Isaiah, and all theother great prophets who were, each in his own time, the kings of the Cabala andthe great rabbis of science.The pentacle, being a complete and perfect synthesis, expressed in one singlesign, is used to assemble all of the intellectual power into a glance, into amemory, into a contact. It is like a point of support from which to project thewill with power. The necromancers and goetic sorcerers drew their infernalpentagrams on the skins of the victims that they sacrificed. We can find theceremonies of sacrifice in several clavicules and grimoires: the manner ofskinning a kid goat then salting it, of drying and of bleaching the skin. A fewHebrew Cabalists fell into the same folly, without remembering the maledictionspronounced in the Bible against those who sacrifice upon high places or in thecaverns of the Earth. All these effusions of blood operated ceremonially areabominable and impious, and since the death of Adonhiram, the society of trueadepts has a horror for blood, Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine.393[9781101992746_EPUB-40_fn.xhtml]The initiatic symbolism of the pentacles which was adopted all through theOrient is the key to all the ancient and modern mythologies. One who does notknow the hieroglyphic alphabet will get lost in the obscurities of the Vedas,the Zend-Avesta, and the Bible. The tree which generates good and evil, uniquesource of the four rivers, one of which waters the earth with gold, that is tosay the light, the other which flows in Ethiopia, or in the kingdom of thenight; the magnetic serpent who had seduced woman, and the woman who had seducedman, thus revealing the law of attraction; then the Cherub or Sphinx placed atthe door to the Edenic sanctuary, with the flaming sword of the guardians ofsymbolism, then regeneration through work, and childbirth through pain, law ofinitiations and of trials; the division between Cain and Abel a symbol identicalto the battle between Anteros and Eros; the ark carried on the waters of theFlood like the coffin of Osiris, the black crow which does not return and thewhite dove which returns, a new emission of the antagonistic and balanceddoctrine: all these magnificent Cabalistic allegories from Genesis, taken to theletter and accepted as true stories, merit even more laughter and scorn thanVoltaire had devoted to them, but they become luminous for the initiate, whothen welcomes with enthusiasm and love the perpetuity of true doctrine and theuniversality of the same initiation into all the sanctuaries of the world.The five books of Moses, the prophecy of Ezekiel, and the Revelation of SaintJohn are the three Cabalistic keys of the entire biblical edifice. The sphinxesof Ezekiel,394 [9781101992746_EPUB-40__1.xhtml] which are identical to those ofthe Sanctuary and the Ark of the Covenant, are a quadruple reproduction of theEgyptian quaternary; the wheels, which turn upon one another, are the harmoniousspheres of Pythagoras; the new temple of which they provide the plan, based onentirely Cabalistic measures, is the perfect example of the works of primordialmasonry. Saint John, in the Book of Revelation, reproduces the same images andthe same numbers, and ideally reconstitutes the Edenic world in the newJerusalem; but at the source of the four rivers, the solar lamb replaces themysterious tree. The initiation through work and through blood is accomplished,and there are no longer any temples because the light of truth is universallyspread out, and because the world has become the temple of justice.This beautiful final dream of the holy Scriptures, this divine utopia which theChurch referred to with reason as the realization of a better life, was thedownfall of all the ancient heresiarchs and a great number of modern ideologues.The simultaneous emancipation and the absolute equality of all men supposes thecessation of progress and in consequence of life: on the earth of equals, therecan be no children or old men; thus birth and death could not be admitted. Thatis enough to prove that the new Jerusalem is no more of this world than theprimordial paradise, where we knew neither good nor evil, nor creation, nordeath; it is thus in eternity that the cycle of our religious symbolism beginsand ends.Dupuis and Volney exerted their great erudition in order to discover theidentity of all symbols and concluded by negating all religions. We arrive bythe same road at the diametrically opposite affirmation, and we recognize withadmiration that there have never been any false religions in the civilizedworld; that the divine light, that splendor of the supreme reason of the Logos,of the Verb, which illuminates any man coming into the world, no more missed thechildren of Zoroaster than it did the faithful sheep of Saint Peter; that thepermanent revelation, unique and universal, is written in visible nature, isexplained by reason, and is completed by the wise analogies of faith; that inthe end there is only one true religion, only one doctrine, and only onelegitimate belief, just like there is only one God, only one reason, and onlyone universe; that the revelation is not obscure for anyone, since everyoneunderstands a little or a lot of truth and justice, and since everything thatcan be must only exist analogically to that which is. BEING IS BEING,[image/112.jpg].The figures, so bizarre in appearance, which the Revelation of Saint Johnpresents, are hieroglyphics, like those of all the oriental mythologies, and canbe enclosed in a series of pentacles. The initiator dressed in white, standingbetween the seven candlesticks of gold and holding in his hand seven stars,represents the unique doctrine of Hermes and the universal analogies of thelight.A woman adorned by the Sun and crowned with twelve stars is the celestial Isis,is the gnosis which the serpent of material life wishes to devour young; but shetakes the wings of an eagle and escapes to the desert, protestation of theprophetic spirit against materialism and official religion.The colossal angel whose face is a sun, whose aureole is a rainbow, whoseclothes are a cloud, whose legs are columns of fire, and who places one foot onthe earth and the other in the sea is a veritable Cabalistic Panthea.395[9781101992746_EPUB-40__2.xhtml]Her feet represent the equilibrium of Briah396 [9781101992746_EPUB-40__3.xhtml]or the world of forms; her legs are the two columns of the Masonic temple,Jachin and Boaz; her body, veiled by clouds, from which comes out a hand readinga book, is the sphere of Yetzirah397 [9781101992746_EPUB-40__4.xhtml] or theinitiatic trials, the solar head, crowned with the luminous septenary, is theworld of Atziluth398 [9781101992746_EPUB-40__5.xhtml] or the perfect revelation,and we are not very surprised that the Hebrew Cabalists did not recognize ordivulge this symbolism, which attaches so closely and inseparably the highestmysteries of Christianity to the secret, but invariable, doctrine of all themasters in Israel.The beast of seven heads, in the symbolism of Saint John, is the material andantagonistic negation of the luminous septenary; the whore of Babyloncorresponds in the same manner to the woman adorned by the Sun; the fourhorsemen are analogous to the four allegorical animals; the seven angels withtheir seven trumpets, their seven cups, and their seven swords characterize theabsolute battle between good and evil through the word, by religiousassociation, and by force. Thus the seven seals of the occult book are openedsuccessively, and the universal initiation is completed. Commentators who lookedfor something else in this book of the high Cabala lost their time and effortsonly to manage to render themselves ridiculous. To see Napoleon in the angelApollyon, Luther in the falling star, Voltaire and Rousseau in the locust armiesat war, is high fantasy. Such is the case for all the violence done to the namesof famous personages in order to enclose them in some number like the fatal 666,which we have sufficiently explained, and when we think that men named Bossuetand Newton amused themselves with these chimeras,399[9781101992746_EPUB-40__6.xhtml] we understand that humanity is not as maliciousin spirit as we might suppose by the appearance of its vices."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XITHE TRIPLE CHAINThe Great Work in practical magic, after the education of the will and thepersonal creation of the mage, is the formation of the magnetic chain, and thissecret is truly that of the priesthood and royalty.To form a magnetic chain, is to give birth to a current of ideas that producesfaith and that leads a great number of wills into a given circle ofmanifestations through acts. A well-formed chain is like a whirlpool which pullsin, and absorbs, everything.A chain can be established in three ways: by signs, by words, and by personalcontact. A chain is established through signs by having a sign adopted by publicopinion as the representation of a force. It is thus that all Christianscommunicate together by the sign of the cross, the Masons by the sign of the setsquare under the Sun, the mages by the sign of the microcosmos which is made byextending the five fingers, and so on.The signs, once received and propagated, acquire power on their own. The sightand imitation of the sign of the cross sufficed in the first few centuries tocreate proselytes for Christianity. The so-called Miraculous Medal still causesa great many conversions in our time by the same magnetic law. The vision andillumination of the young Israelite Alphonse de Ratisbonne were the mostremarkable instances of this kind. Imagination is creative, not only within us,but outside of us, through our fluidic projections, and we should doubtless notattribute to other causes the phenomena of Constantine’s labarum400[9781101992746_EPUB-41_fn.xhtml] and the cross of Migné.401[9781101992746_EPUB-41__1.xhtml]The magical chain through the word is represented, by the ancients, by thosechains of gold which come out of the mouth of Hermes. Nothing is equal to theelectrifying effect of eloquence. The word creates the highest intelligence inthe heart of the most crudely composed masses. Even those who are too far tohear understand by the commotion caused by those words and are drawn in like therest of the crowd. Peter the Hermit shocked all of Europe by crying out: Godwills it!402 [9781101992746_EPUB-41__2.xhtml] A single word from the Emperorelectrified his army and rendered France invincible. Proudhon killed socialismwith his famous paradox “Property is theft.” A single word which takes flightoften suffices to overturn a power. Voltaire knew this well, he who turned theworld upside down with his sarcasms; he, who feared neither popes, nor kings,nor the parliament, nor prison was afraid of a play on words.We are on the cusp of accomplishing the will of any man whose words we repeat.The third manner of establishing a magical chain is through contact. Betweenpersons who see each other often, the head of the current is soon revealed, andthe stronger will does not take long to absorb the others; direct and positivecontact of hand to hand completes the harmony of dispositions, and it is forthis reason that it is a mark of sympathy and intimacy. Children, who areinstinctively guided by nature, create a magical chain when they play BritishBulldog or Ring Around the Rosie. Then gaiety circulates and laughter blossoms.Round tables are also more favorable to joyous banquets than tables of any otherform. The great round dance of the Sabbath, which came at the end of themysterious reunions of the adepts of the Middle Ages, was a magical chain whichunited everyone in the same desires and the same works; they formed it byplacing themselves with their backs facing the others and holding each other bythe hands, their faces facing out of the circle, in imitation of the ancientsacred dances whose images we still find on the bas-reliefs of ancient temples.The electric furs of the lynx, the panther, and even the domestic cat, were, inimitation of the ancient bacchanalia, attached to their clothing. From therecame the tradition that the miscreants at the Sabbath each carry a cat hangingfrom their belt and dance with it attached to them.The phenomena of turning and talking tables403 [9781101992746_EPUB-41__3.xhtml]is an accidental manifestation of fluidic communication through the circularchain; and then mystification got mixed into it, and even educated andintelligent people became impassioned by this novelty to the point of mystifyingthemselves and becoming dupes of their own infatuation. The oracles of thetables were suggested answers more or less voluntary or randomly chosen; theyresembled the discourse one has or hears in dreams. Other, even strangerphenomena could be the externalized products of a common imagination. We do notdeny, without doubt, the possible intervention of the elementary spirits inthese manifestations as in divination by cards or by dreams; but we in no waybelieve that this is proven, and therefore nothing obliges us to admitotherwise.The strangest power of the human imagination is the realization of the desiresof the will, or even its apprehensions and fears. “We easily believe in what wefear or what we desire,” says the proverb, and it is correct, because desire andfear provide the imagination with creative power whose effects are incalculable.How is it, for example, that we are so often infected by the illness we fear? Wehave already recounted Paracelsus’s opinions on this subject, and we haveestablished in our Doctrine the occult laws as observed through experience; butthrough magnetic currents and through the intercession of the chain, theserealizations are even stranger still, since they are almost always unexpectedwhen the chain is not formed by an intelligent, sympathetic, and strong leader.They result in fact from purely random and fortuitous combinations. Vulgar fearsof superstitious dinner guests when they find themselves thirteen at a table,combined with the conviction that a misfortune menaces the youngest and weakestamong them, are, like most superstitions, a relic of the magical science. Theduodenary, being a complete and cyclical number in the universal analogies ofnature, always pulls in and absorbs the thirteenth, a number regarded as unluckyand superfluous. If the circle of a windmill’s grindstone is represented by thenumber twelve, the number thirteen is the grain it will grind. The ancientsestablished, based on similar considerations, the distinction between luckynumbers and unlucky ones, which resulted in the observance of days of bad andgood omen. It is with this type of material that the imagination is the mostcreative, and numbers and days rarely miss being favorable or ill-fated forthose who believe in their influence. It is thus with reason that Christianityproscribed the divinatory sciences because in thus diminishing the number offatal chances it provided more resources and more control to liberty.Printing is an admirable mechanism for forming a magical chain by the extensionof the word. In effect, not one single book is ever lost: writings always gowhere they must go, and the aspirations of thought attract words. We have proventhis a hundred times during the course of our initiation into magic: the rarestof books always offered themselves to us without our searching for them, themoment they became indispensable for us. It is in this manner that werediscovered intact this universal science that many erudites believed wasburied under several successive cataclysms; it is thus that we entered into thegreat magical chain which begins with Hermes or Enoch and will only finish withthe world. Thus we were able to invoke and render present the spirits ofApollonius, of Plotinus, of Synesius, of Paracelsus, of Cardano, of CorneliusAgrippa, and so many others who are more or less known but who are tooreligiously famous for us to name lightly. We continue their Great Work, whichothers will take on after us. But to whom will it be given to complete it?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIITHE GREAT WORKTo be always rich, ever young, and never die: such has always been the dream ofthe alchemists.To change lead, mercury, and all the other metals into gold, to possess theuniversal medicine and the elixir of life: this is the problem which must beresolved in order to accomplish this wish and realize this dream.Like all magical mysteries, the secrets of the Great Work have a triplesignification: they are religious, philosophical, and natural.The philosophical gold in religion is absolute and supreme reason; inphilosophy, it is truth; in visible nature, it is the Sun; in the undergroundand mineral world, it is the most perfect and pure gold.It is for this reason that we call the search for the Great Work the search forthe absolute, and that we even designate this work by the name of the Labor ofthe Sun.All the masters of the science recognize that it is impossible to arrive atmaterial results if we have not found in the two upper degrees all the analogiesof the universal medicine and of the philosopher’s stone.Also, so they say, the work is simple, easy, and inexpensive; if pursuedotherwise, it fruitlessly consumes the fortune of the lives of so-calledpuffers.404 [9781101992746_EPUB-42_fn.xhtml]The universal medicine for the soul is supreme reason and absolute justice; forthe spirit, it is mathematical and practical truth; for the body, it is thequintessence, which is a combination of light and gold.The raw material of the Great Work in the upper world is enthusiasm andactivity; in the intermediate world, it is intelligence and industry; in thelower world, it is labor; and in science, it is sulfur, mercury, and salt,which, successively volatilized and fixed, compose the Azoth of the sages.All the masters of alchemy who wrote about the Great Work used symbolic andfigurative expressions, and they had to do so, as much to distance the profanefrom a work which is dangerous to them as to be properly heard by adepts, byrevealing the entire world of the analogies which rules the unique and sovereigndoctrine of Hermes.Thus, for them, gold and silver are the king and queen, or the Moon and the Sun;sulfur is the flying eagle; mercury is the winged and bearded androgen standingon a cube and crowned in flames; matter or salt is the winged dragon; the metalsat boiling point are lions of diverse colors; finally, the entire work issymbolized by the pelican and the phoenix.The Hermetic art is thus at the same time a religion, a philosophy, and anatural science. As a religion, it belongs to the ancient mages and initiates ofall times; as a philosophy, we can find its principles in the school ofAlexandria and in the theories of Pythagoras; as a science, one must askPythagoras, Nicolas Flamel, and Raymond Lully for the procedures.The science is only real to those who admit and understand philosophy andreligion, and its procedures can only be successfully enacted by the adept whohas achieved sovereign will and has thus become the king of the elementaryworld; because the great agent of the operation of the Sun is that forcedescribed by Hermes’s symbol of the Emerald Tablet; it is universal magicalpower; it is the fiery spiritual mover; it is the OD according to the Hebrews,and the astral light according to the expression we have adopted in this work.That is the secret fire, living and philosophic, which all the Hermeticphilosophers only discuss with the most mysterious reserve; it is the universalsperm whose secret they have kept, and which they represent only by the figureof Hermes’s caduceus.Here, then, is the great Hermetic arcanum, and we reveal it here clearly andwithout mystical figures for the first time: what the adepts call dead matterconsists of bodies as they are found in nature; living bodies are substanceswhich are assimilated and magnetized by the science and the will of theoperator.In this manner the Great Work is something more than a chemical operation: it isa veritable creation of the initiated human Verb to the power of the Verb of Goditself.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-42_vector-1.jpg][image/114.jpg][image/115.jpg][image/116.jpg][image/117.jpg][image/118.jpg][image/119.jpg]This Hebrew text, which we transcribe here as proof of the authenticity andreality of our discovery, is by the Jewish Rabbi Abraham, Nicolas Flamel’smaster, and is found in the occult commentary of the Sepher Yetzirah, the sacredbook of the Cabala.405 [9781101992746_EPUB-42__1.xhtml] This commentary is veryrare; but sympathetic powers from our chain allowed us to find an example, whichwas conserved until 1643 in the library of the Protestant church of Rouen. Weread there, written on the first page: Ex dono; then an illegible name, then Deimagni.The creation of gold in the Great Work is done through transmutation and bymultiplication.Raymond Lully says that to make gold, one must have gold and mercury; that tomake silver, one must have silver and mercury. Then he adds: “By mercury I meanthat mineral spirit so fine and so pure that it even gilds the seed of gold andsilvers the seed of silver.” There is no doubt that he speaks here of the OD orastral light.Salt and sulfur are only used in the work for the preparation of mercury, and itis above all to mercury which one must assimilate and, in a manner, incorporatethe magnetic agent. Paracelsus, Raymond Lully, and Nicolas Flamel seem to be theonly ones to have perfectly understood this mystery. Basilius Valentinus andBernard Trevisan indicate an imperfect manner of doing so, and one which can beinterpreted in other ways. But the most curious things which we have foundregarding this subject are indicated by the mystical figures and the magicallegends of a book by Heinrich Khunrath entitled: Amphitheatrum SapientiaeAeternae.406 [9781101992746_EPUB-42__2.xhtml]Khunrath represents and summarizes the most knowledgeable Gnostic schools andassociates himself with the mysticism of Synesius. He affects being Christian inhis expressions and his signs, but it is easy to recognize that his Christ isthat of Abraxas, the luminous shining pentagram on the astronomical cross, theincarnation in humanity of the sun-king celebrated by Emperor Julian; it is theluminous and living manifestation of that Ruach Elohim that, according to Moses,covered and worked the surface of the waters at the birth of the world;407[9781101992746_EPUB-42__3.xhtml] it is the man-sun, it is the king of light, itis the supreme mage, master, and vanquisher of the serpent, and Khunrath findsin the quadruple legend of the Gospels the allegorical key to the Great Work. Inone of the pentacles of his magical book, he represents the philosopher’s stonestanding in the middle of a fortress surrounded by a wall with twenty doors thatlead nowhere. One way alone leads to the sanctuary of the Great Work.Above the stone is the triangle on a winged dragon, and on the stone is engravedthe name of Christ, which he qualifies as the symbolic image of all of nature.“It is through him alone,” he adds, “that you are able to reach the universalmedicine for man, for animals, for plants, and for minerals.” The winged dragondominated by the triangle represents the Christ of Khunrath, that is to say thesovereign intelligence of light and life: it is the secret of the pentagram, itis the highest doctrinal and practical mystery of traditional magic. From thereto the great and ever incommunicable arcanum is but one more step.The Cabalistic figures of Abraham the Jew, who provided Flamel with thebeginning of the science,408 [9781101992746_EPUB-42__4.xhtml] are nothing otherthan the twenty-two keys of the Tarot, imitated and summarized elsewhere in thetwelve keys of Basilius Valentinus. The Sun and the Moon reappear there underthe figures of the Emperor and the Empress; Mercury is the Magus; the grandHierophant is the adept or the abstracter of quintessence; death, judgment,love, the dragon or the devil, the hermit or the lame old man, and finally allthe other symbols which are found with their principal attributes and almost inthe same order. It could not be otherwise, since the Tarot is the primordialbook and the keystone of the occult sciences; it must be as hermetic as it isCabalistic, magical, and theosophical. We also find in the reunion ofValentinius’s twelfth and twenty-second key, one superimposed on the other, thehieroglyphic revelation of our solution to the mystery of the Great Work.The twelfth key of the Tarot represents a man suspended by a foot to a gibbetcomposed of three trees, or sticks, forming the figure of the Hebrew letter[image/9781101992746_EPUB-42_vector-2.jpg]; the man’s arms form a triangle withhis head, and his entire hieroglyphic form is that of an upside-down trianglemounted on a cross, an alchemical symbol known by all the adepts, whichrepresents the accomplishment of the Great Work. The twenty-second key, whichhas the number twenty-one because the Fool, which precedes it in the Cabalisticorder, has no number, represents a young divinity who is lightly veiled andrunning through a flowery crown supported at the four corners by the fouranimals of the Cabala. This divinity holds a wand in each hand in the ItalianTarot deck, and in the Tarot of Besançon409 [9781101992746_EPUB-42__5.xhtml] sheunites both wands in one single hand and places her other hand on her thigh,both equally remarkable symbols of magnetic action, either alternatively bytheir polarization or simultaneously through opposition and transmission.The Great Work of Hermes is thus an essentially magical operation, and thehighest of all, because it supposes the absolute in science and in the will.There is light in gold, and there is gold in light, and there is light in allthings. The intelligent will which assimilates the light thus directs theoperations of the substantial form, and only uses chemistry as a whollysecondary instrument. The influence of the will and human intelligence on theoperations of nature, in part dependent on its work, is incidentally so real afact that all serious alchemists who have succeeded because of their knowledgeand their faith have reproduced their thought in the phenomenon of the fusion,of the salification, and of the recomposition of metals. Agrippa, a man ofimmense erudition and beautiful genius, but a pure philosopher and a skeptic,was unable to surpass the limits of the analysis and the synthesis of metals.Etteilla, a confused, befuddled, and fantastical Cabalist, who was nonethelessblessed with perseverance, reproduced in alchemy the anomalies of hismisunderstood and disfigured Tarot; the metals in their crucibles took onsingular forms which excited the curiosity of all Paris, without any otherchange in the fortunes of the operator than the fees he demanded of hisvisitors. An obscure alchemist of our time, who died mad, the poor LouisCambriel,410 [9781101992746_EPUB-42__6.xhtml] truly did heal his neighbors, andresuscitated, according to the whole neighborhood, a smith and his friends. Forhim, the metallic work took on the most inconceivable forms and were mostillogical in appearance. He saw one day in his crucible the figure of Godincandescent like the Sun, transparent like crystal, and having a body composedof triangular assemblages that Cambriel naively compared to piles of littlepears.A Cabalist who is among our friends and who is wise, but who belongs to aninitiation we believe to be erroneous, recently conducted chemical operations ofthe Great Work; he managed to weaken his eyes due to the incandescence of theathanor, and he created a new metal which resembles gold, but which is not gold,and in consequence has no value. Raymond Lully, Nicholas Flamel, and veryprobably Heinrich Khunrath made true gold and did not take their secret withthem, since they concealed it within their symbols and indicated the sourceswhich aided them in discovering and realizing the effects. It is this samesecret that we publish today."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIIINECROMANCYWe have boldly stated our thoughts, or rather our convictions, regarding thepossibility of resurrection in certain cases; we must complete the revelation ofthis arcanum here by exposing its practice.Death is the phantom of ignorance; it does not exist: all is alive in nature,and it is because all is alive that everything incessantly mutates and changesform.Old age is the beginning of regeneration; it is life working to renew itself,and the mystery which we call death was symbolized by the ancients as thefountain of Youth where one enters decrepit and exits a child.The body is the vestment of the soul. When this vestment is completely used orgravely and irreparably torn, the soul leaves and does not return to it. Butwhen, by some accident, the soul escapes this vestment without the latter beingeither worn out or destroyed, the soul can, in certain cases, go back to it,either by its own efforts or with the assistance of another will which isstronger and more active.Death is neither the end of life nor the beginning of immortality; it is thecontinuation of the transformation of life.As transformation is always progression, there are few who are apparently deadwho consent to live again; that is to say, go back to the vestment they havejust left. This is what renders resurrection one of the most difficult works ofhigh initiation. Also, success is never infallible and must always be regardedas accidental and unexpected. To resuscitate a dead man, one must suddenly andenergetically tighten the strongest chains of attraction that can link him backto the form he has just left. It is thus necessary first to know this chain,then to be able to control it, and then produce an effort of will large enoughto instantaneously relink him to it with an irresistible power.All this, we say, is extremely difficult, but not absolutely impossible.Prejudiced material scientists do not admit resurrection as part of the naturalorder in our day and are disposed to explain all the phenomena of this order bymore or less complicated and more or less long symptoms of lethargy. A Lazarusresurrected today before our doctors would simply be noted in their officialreports to their academies as a strange case of lethargy accompanied by thebeginnings of an apparent putrefaction and a relatively strong cadaverous odor;we would name it an exceptional accident, and all will have been said.We do not like to offend anyone, and, if out of respect for the decorated menwho officially represent science, one must call our resurrectionist theories theart of curing exceptional and hopeless lethargies, I hope that nothing wouldprevent us from making this concession to them.If a resurrection has ever occurred in the world, it would be incontestable thatresurrection is possible. Yet the bodies thus reconstituted protect religion;religion positively affirms the fact of resurrections: thus resurrections arepossible. It is difficult to get out of this.To say that resurrections are possible outside of the laws of nature and throughan influence contrary to universal harmony is to affirm that the spirit ofdisorder, the shadow of death, can be the supreme arbiter of life. Let us notargue with the worshipers of Satan, and move on.But it is not religion alone which attests to the facts of resurrection: we havecollected several other examples. An occurrence which struck the imagination ofthe painter Greuze was reproduced by him in one of his most remarkable tableaux:an unworthy son, beside the deathbed of his father, grabs and tears up atestament which was not favorable to him;411 [9781101992746_EPUB-43_fn.xhtml]the father reanimates, rushes up, curses his son, and then lies back down to diea second time. An analogous and more recent occurrence was attested to us byeyewitnesses: a person, betraying the confidence of his friend who just died,took back and tore up an attestation of trusteeship signed by himself; at thatmoment, the dead man revived and remained alive to defend the rights of hischosen inheritors whom his unfaithful friend wished to dispossess; the guiltyman became mad, and the resuscitated dead man was compassionate enough toprovide him with a pension.When the Savior resuscitated the daughter of Jairus,412[9781101992746_EPUB-43__4.xhtml] he entered alone with his three trusted andfavorite disciples; he separated out those who were making noise and crying,while telling them: “This young girl is not dead, she sleeps.” Then, in thepresence of only the father, the mother, and the three disciples, that is to saya perfect circle of confidence and desire, he took the hand of the child,brusquely raised it, and cried out to her: “Young girl, rise up!” The younggirl, whose undecided soul no doubt wandered near her body, and who perhapsregretted the loss of an extremely beautiful and young body, surprised by theaccent of that voice, to which her mother and father listened on their kneesshivering with hope, entered back into her body, opened her eyes, got up, andthe Master immediately ordered that she be given something to eat, so that thelife functions would restart a new cycle of absorption and regeneration.The stories of Elisha resuscitating the son of the Shunammite413[9781101992746_EPUB-43__5.xhtml] and Saint Paul resuscitating Eutychus414[9781101992746_EPUB-43__6.xhtml] are occurrences of the same order; theresurrection of Dorcas by Saint Peter, told with such simplicity in the Book ofActs,415 [9781101992746_EPUB-43__7.xhtml] is also a story whose truth couldhardly be reasonably contested. Apollonius of Tyana seems also to haveaccomplished similar marvels. We ourselves were witness to occurrences which arenot without analogy to the above, though the spirit of the century in which wemust live imposes upon us the most discreet reserve regarding this subject,since thaumaturges who are exposed today get a rather mediocre reception beforethe public: which does not stop the Earth from turning, and Galileo from being agreat man.The resurrection of a dead person is the masterpiece of magnetism, because onemust, to accomplish it, exert a type of sympathetic omnipotence. It is possiblein cases of death due to congestion, suffocation, lethargy, and hysteria.Eutychus, who was resuscitated by Saint Paul after falling from the third floor,had doubtless not broken anything inside himself, and had no doubt succumbed toeither asphyxia occasioned by the movement of the air during his fall or seizuredue to fear. One must, in such a case, and when we feel the power and faithnecessary to accomplish such a work, practice, like the apostle, mouth to mouthinsufflation, by making contact with the extremities in order to bring back theheat of the body. If this was simply a case of what the ignorant call a miracle,Elijah and Saint Paul, whose procedures were the same in similar cases, wouldmerely have spoken in the name of Jehovah or of Christ instead.It may sometimes suffice to take the person by the hand and energetically raiseit while loudly calling out their name. This procedure, which ordinarily worksfor fainting episodes, can have the same effect on death when the actingmagnetizer is gifted by a sympathetically powerful speech and possesses what wecan call eloquence of the voice. He must also either be tenderly loved orrespected by the person upon whom he wishes to act, and he must perform his workwith a great surge of faith and of will, which cannot always be found withinoneself during the first shock of great sorrow.What we vulgarly call necromancy has nothing to do with resurrection, and it isalso highly doubtful that, in operations relative to this application of magicalpower, one actually makes contact with the souls of the dead whom one evokes.There are two types of necromancy: the necromancy of light and the necromancy ofdarkness: evocation through prayer, the pentacle, and the perfumes; andevocation through blood, imprecations, and blasphemies. We have only practicedthe first ourselves, and we do not counsel anyone to devote themselves to thesecond.It is certain that images of the dead appear to the magnetized persons who evokethem; it is also certain that they never reveal any mysteries regarding the nextlife. We see them again in the manner they would still be in the memory of thosewho knew them, no doubt in the way in which their reflections left their imprintupon the astral light. When specters are evoked and respond to the questions oneasks them, it is always through signs or by imaginary and interior impressions,never with a voice which actually hits the ears; and this is relativelyunderstandable: how can a shadow talk? With what instrument would it make theair vibrate, hitting it in such a manner as to make one distinguish sounds?One experiences, however, electrical contacts during apparitions, and thesecontacts seem sometimes to be produced by the phantom itself; but thisphenomenon is entirely interior and must have as an only cause the power of theimagination and local peaks in occult power which we call the astral light.Which proves that spirits, or at least specters believed to be such, actuallyaffect us sometimes, but we are unable to touch them, and it is one of the mostfrightening circumstances regarding apparitions, because the visions sometimesappear real, and we cannot remain emotionless when our hand passes through whatseems to us to be a body without touching or encountering anything.One can read in the ecclesiastical histories that Spyridon, the bishop ofTremetousia who was since named a saint, evoked the spirit of his daughter Ireneto learn from her the location of a hidden cache of money that she had receivedfrom a traveler. Swedenborg habitually communicated with the so-called dead,whose forms appeared to him in the astral light. We have known several otherpersons we trust who assured us of having seen again over entire years a defunctwhom they cared dearly about. The famous atheist Sylvain Maréchal appeared tohis widow and to a friend of hers to tell them about a sum of fifteen hundredgold francs which he had hidden in a secret compartment of a piece of furniture.We received this anecdote from an old friend of the family.Evocations must always be motivated and have an honorable goal; otherwise, theyare operations of darkness and folly, very dangerous to the mind and health. Toevoke purely out of curiosity and to find out if one will see something is to bedisposed in advance to tiring oneself for nothing. The high sciences admitneither doubt nor puerility.An honorable motive for an evocation can be either for love or for knowledge.Evocations of love require fewer materials and are in any case easier. Here ishow one must proceed:You must first carefully gather all the memories of the person you want to seeagain, the objects she used and which have kept her imprint, and furnish eithera room which that person occupied while alive or a similar locale with herportrait, veiled in white, in the middle of flowers that person liked and thatyou renew every day.Then you must observe a precise date, a day of the year which was either herbirthday or the happiest day for your affection and hers, a day in which weassume that her soul, no matter how happy it is now, could not have lost thememory of: it is that very day that you must choose for the evocation and forwhich you must prepare for during fourteen days.During that time, you must be sure not to give the same proofs of affection toanyone else which the defunct had the right to expect from you; you must observea strict chastity, live in retreat, and only have one modest meal, as well as alight snack, each day.Every evening, at the same time, you must close yourself off with a single lowlight, such as a small funeral lamp or candle, in the room consecrated to thememory of the regretted person; you place this light behind yourself and thenuncover the portrait, in the presence of which you remain silent for an hour;then you perfume the room with a little bit of good incense, and you leave bywalking out backwards.416 [9781101992746_EPUB-43__8.xhtml]On the day set aside for the evocation, you must prepare right from the morningas though for a celebration: do not speak first to anyone the entire day, eat asingle meal of only bread, wine, and roots or fruits; the tablecloth must bewhite; you will set the table for two and break off a portion of the bread,which must have been served whole; you will also place a few drops of wine inthe glass of the person you wish to evoke. This meal must be eaten in silence,in the evocation room, in the presence of the veiled portrait; then you carryaway all that was used for the meal, except the defunct’s glass and her portionof the bread, which will be left before her portrait.In the evening, at the habitual hour for visits, you will go back into the roomin silence; you will light a bright light with cypress wood, and you will throwincense into it seven times while pronouncing the name of the person you wish tosee again; you will then put out the lamp and let the fire die. You do notunveil the portrait on that day.When the flame has gone out, you will add more incense to the coals, and youwill invoke God according to the formulas of the religion to which the deceasedperson belonged and according to the ideas she herself had of God.You must, when saying this prayer, identify yourself with the evoked person,speak as she would speak, believe in a certain manner in what she believed;then, after a quarter hour of silence, talk to her as though she were present,with affection and faith, while praying to her to show herself to you; renewthis prayer mentally while covering your face with both hands, then call out tothe person three times in a loud voice; wait while kneeling and with eyes closedor covered for a few minutes while speaking to her mentally; then call out threetimes to her again in a soft and affectionate voice and slowly open your eyes.If you see nothing, you will have to try the experience again in a year’s timeand up to three times. It is certain that by at least the third time you willobtain the desired apparition, and, the longer she took, the more she will bevisible and strikingly real.Evocations of science and intelligence are done with more solemn ceremonies. Ifthe evocation is of a famous person, one must meditate over twenty-one days onhis life and writings, get an idea of his personality, of his countenance and ofhis voice; speak to him mentally and imagine his responses; carry on your personhis portrait or at least his name; be sure to keep to a vegetarian diet duringthe twenty-one days, and be on a strict fast the last seven days; then constructa magical oratory just as we described it in chapter 13 of our Doctrine. Theoratory must be entirely closed, but if you must operate during the day, you canleave a narrow opening on the side where the Sun will be at the hour of theevocation and place before this opening a triangular prism, then a crystal globefilled with water in front of the prism. If you must operate at night, you willplace a magical lamp in such a manner that its unique ray will fall on the smokefrom the altar. The goal of these preparations is to provide the magical agentwith the elements for a physical apparition and to also relieve the tension ofour imagination, which we do not exalt without the risk of it becoming anabsolute dream illusion. We understand well enough, incidentally, that adiversely colored ray from the Sun or a lamp falling upon mobile and irregularsmoke can in no way create a perfect image. The brazier of the sacred fire mustbe in the center of the oratory, and the altar of perfumes not very far awayfrom it. The operator must turn towards the Orient to pray, towards the Occidentto evoke; he must be alone or assisted by two people who keep a strict silence;he will have magical vestments such as we described in the seventh chapter, andwill be crowned in verbena and gold. He must have bathed before the operation,and all the clothes underneath must be perfectly intact and clean.Begin with a prayer appropriate to the genius of the spirit you wish to evoke,and which he could approve of were he still alive. Thus, we would never evokeVoltaire, for example, by reciting orations in the style of Saint Bridget.417[9781101992746_EPUB-43__9.xhtml] For the great men of antiquity, you will saythe hymns of Cleanthes or Orpheus, with the sermon which ends the golden versesof Pythagoras. When we evoked Apollonius, we took as a ritual the philosophicalmagic of Patrizi, which contain the doctrines of Zoroaster and the works ofHermes Trismegistus. We read aloud Apollonius’s Nuctemeron in Greek, and weadded the following conjuration:418 [9781101992746_EPUB-43_10.xhtml]Βουλῆς δὲ ὁ πατὴρ πάντων καὶ καθηγητὴςὁ τρισμέγιστος Ἑρμῆς, ἰατρικῆς δὲὁἈσκληπιὸς ὁἩφαίστου,ἰσχύος δὲ καὶῥώμης πάλιν Ὄσιρις, μεθ᾽ ὃν ὦ τέκνον αὐτὸς σύ,φιλοσοφίας δὲἈρνεβεσχῆνις ποιητικῆς δὲ πάλιν ὁ Ἀσκληπιὸς ὁ Ἰμούθης.Οὖτοι τὰ κρυπτὰ,φησὶν Ἑρμῆς, τῶν ἐμῶν ἐπιγνώσονται γραμμάτων πάντων καὶδιακρινοῦσι, καὶ τινὰ μὲν αὐτοὶ κατασχῶσιν,ἃ δὲ καὶ πρὸς εὐεργεσίας θνητῶνφθάνει, στήλαις καὶ ὀβελίσκοις χαράξουσιν.Μαγείαν ὁ Ἀπολλώνιος, ὁ Ἀπολλώνιος, ὁ Ἀπολλώνιος τε διδάσκειτοῦ Ζωροάστρου τοῦὩρομάζου, ἐστὶ δὲ τοῦτο θεῶν θεράπεια.For the evocation of spirits belonging to the religions emanating from Judaism,one must say the Cabalistic invocation of Solomon, either in Hebrew, or in anyother language that you know was familiar to the spirit being evoked:Powers of the kingdom, may you be under my left foot and in my right hand; Gloryand Eternity, touch my two shoulders and direct me down the roads of victory;Mercy and Justice, may you be the balance and splendor of my life; Intelligenceand Wisdom, give me the crown; spirits of Malkuth, bring me between the twocolumns upon which the entire edifice of the temple rests; angels of Netzach andof Hod, fortify me on the cubic stone of Yesod.O Gedulael! O Geburael! O Tiphareth! Binael, be my love; Ruach Hochmael, be mylight; be what you are and what you will be, O Ketheriel!Ishim, assist me in the name of Shaddai.Cherubim, be my strength in the name of Adonai.Beni Elohim, be my brothers in the name of the son and by the virtues ofTzabaoth.Elohim, fight for me in the name of the Tetragrammaton.Malakhim, protect me in the name of[image/9781101992746_EPUB-43_vector-1.jpg].419 [9781101992746_EPUB-43_11.xhtml]Seraphim, purify my love in the name of Eloah.Chashmalim, enlighten me with the splendors of Eloï and of Shekinah.Aralim, act; Ophanim, turn and be resplendent.Chaioth ha-Qodesh, shout, speak, roar, bellow: Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, Shaddai,Adonai, Yodchavah, Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh.Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Amen.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-43_vector-2.jpg]420 [9781101992746_EPUB-43__1.xhtml]Most of all one must remember well, in the conjurations, that the names ofSatan, of Beelzebub, of Adramelech, and the others do not designate spiritualunities but the legions of impure spirits. “I am called Legion,” the spirit ofdarkness says in the Gospel, “for we are many.”421[9781101992746_EPUB-43__2.xhtml] In hell, anarchy reigns, it is the crowd thatrules, and progress occurs in the inverse direction, that is to say that thosemost advanced in Satanic development, in consequence the most degraded, are theleast intelligent and the weakest. Thus a fatal law pushes demons to descendwhen they believe and wish to climb up. Also, those who call themselves theleaders are the most impotent and the most despised of all. As to the mass ofperverse spirits, they tremble before an unknown leader, invisible,incomprehensible, capricious, implacable, who never explains his laws and whoalways has his arm extended to strike those who cannot perceive it. They givethis phantom the names of Baal, of Jupiter, or other even more venerable names,which one may not pronounce in hell without profaning them; but this phantom isnothing but a shadow and a memory of God, disfigured by their voluntaryperversity, and remaining in their imagination like the vengeance of justice andthe remorse of the truth.When a spirit of light which you evoke shows himself with a sad or irritatedexpression, you must offer him a moral sacrifice, that is to say be internallydisposed to renounce what offends him, then one must, before leaving theoratory, send him away by saying to him: May peace be with you! I did not wishto trouble you, do not torment me; I will work to reform myself with regard toall which offends you; I pray and I will pray with you and for you; pray with meand for me and return to your great sleep, until the day when we will awaketogether. Silence and farewell!We will not end this chapter without adding, for the curious, a few detailsregarding the ceremonies of black necromancy. We can find out from severalancient authors how the sorceresses of Thessaly and the Canidiae of Romepracticed it. They dug a pit, at the edge of which they slit the throat of ablack ewe; then with a sword they separated out the psyllae and larvae whichwere supposedly present and hastened to drink the blood; they invoked the tripleHecate and the infernal gods, and they called out three times to the shadow theywished to see appear.In the Middle Ages, necromancers profaned graves, composed potions and unguentswith the grease and blood of cadavers; they mixed into these aconite,belladonna, and poisonous mushrooms; then they annealed and frothed thesehorrible mixtures over fires composed of human bones and crucifixes stolen fromchurches; they mixed in powder of dried toads and the ashes of consecrated holybread; then they rubbed this infernal unguent onto their temples, their hands,and their chests, drew the diabolical pentagram, and evoked the dead undergibbets or in abandoned cemeteries. One could hear their screams from afar, andlate-night travelers thought they saw legions of phantoms arising from theEarth; the trees themselves took on frightful forms in their eyes; they saw eyesof fire scintillating in the bushes, and the frogs of the marshes seemed torepeat in a single rough voice the mysterious speech of the Sabbath. It was themagnetism of hallucination and the contagion of madness.The procedures of black magic have as their goal to disturb reason and produceall the feverish exaltations which provide the courage to commit great crimes.The grimoires that the authorities previously seized and burned anywhere theyfound them were certainly not innocent books. Sacrilege, murder, and theft wererecommended or implied as the means of realization in almost all these works. Itis thus that in the Grand Grimoire and in the Dragon Rouge, a more modernforgery of the Grand Grimoire, we can read a recipe entitled: Composition ofdeath, or the philosopher’s stone. It is a kind of consommé of aqua fortis,copper, arsenic, and verdigris.422 [9781101992746_EPUB-43__3.xhtml]We also find these necromantic procedures, which consist of excavating the earthover graves with your nails, in order to remove the bones within that you wearas a cross over your chest, and of then participating in a midnight mass, on thenight of Christmas, in a church, and at the moment of the elevation, rising upand running away while yelling: “May the dead be released from their graves!”Then returning to the cemetery, taking a fistful of earth which is closest tothe coffin, coming back at a run to the door of the church where everyone willhave been terrified by your clamor and placing down the two bones in a crosswhile yelling again: “May the dead be released from their graves!” And if no oneis to be found there to arrest you and take you off to the madhouse, you walkaway slowly, counting four thousand five hundred steps without turning aside,which presupposes that either you are following a long road or climbing walls.At the end of these four thousand five hundred steps, you lie down on theground; after having scattered the earth you held in your hand in a crossformation, you will position yourself as one is placed in a coffin, and you willrepeat in a gloomy voice: “May the dead,” etc., and you will call out threetimes to the person you wish to see appear. One should not doubt that the personmad enough and perverse enough to surrender themselves to such works is alreadydisposed to all the chimeras and phantoms. This recipe from the Grand Grimoireis thus certainly efficacious, but we do not counsel any of our readers to makeuse of it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIVTRANSMUTATIONS[image/Doctrine_Magic_22.jpg]Saint Augustine, as we have said, asks if Apuleius could have been changed intoan ass and then rendered back to his first form. The same scholar could haveequally preoccupied himself with the adventure of Ulysses’s companions who werechanged into swine by Circe. Transmutations and metamorphoses have always been,in the opinion of the vulgar, the essence of magic itself. Yet the vulgar, whoare the echo of general opinion, queen of the world, are never completely rightnor totally wrong.Magic truly changes the nature of things, or rather modifies their appearance asdesired, according to the force of the will of the operator and the fascinationof aspiring adepts. The word created its form, and when a person reputed to beinfallible has named a thing with whatever name, he truly transforms that thinginto the substance signified by the name he gives it. The masterpiece of thiskind, of the word and of faith, is the real transmutation of a substance whoseappearance does not change. If Apollonius had said to his disciples while givingthem a cup filled with wine, “Here is my blood, which you shall always drink toperpetuate my life within you,” and if his disciples had over several centuriescontinued this transformation and repeated the same words, and taken the wine,despite its smell and taste, for the real, human, and living blood ofApollonius, we would have to recognize this master in theurgy as being the mostskillful of fascinators and the most powerful of all mages. All that wouldremain is for us to adore him.We know that magnetizers can make the water they give to those they hypnotizehave any taste they wish, and if we suppose a mage with enough power over theastral fluid to magnetize an entire assembly of people previously prepared to bemagnetized through sufficient overexcitation, we can easily explain, not theevangelical miracle at Cana, but works of the same type.Are not the fascinations of love, which result from the universal magic ofnature, veritable wonders, and do they not truly transform people and things?Love is a dream of enchantment which transfigures the world: all becomes musicand perfume, all becomes euphoria and happiness. The person loved is beautiful,he is good, he is sublime, he is infallible, he is resplendent, radiating healthand well-being . . . ; and, when the dream dissipates, we believe we have fallendown naked; we look with disgust upon the ugly witch who has taken the place ofthe beautiful Melusine, or the Thersites whom we took for Achilles or forNereus. What would we not believe of the person whom we love? And then with whatreason and what justice would we understand a person who loves us no longer?Love begins by being a magician; it ends by being a sorcerer. After havingcreated the lies of heaven on earth, it realizes those of hell; its hatred isjust as absurd as its enthusiasm, because it is passionate, that is to saysubjected to influences which are fatal to it. It is for this reason that thesages proscribed it and declared it the enemy of reason. Were the sages to beenvied or felt sorry for when they thus condemned without having heard, nodoubt, the most seductive of culprits? All that we can say is, when they spokethus, they had not yet loved or loved no longer.Things are for us what our interior verb makes them be. To believe oneself to behappy is to be happy; that which we esteem becomes precious in the exactproportion of our esteem for it: that is how we can say that magic changes thenature of things. The Metamorphoses of Ovid are true, but they are allegoricallike The Golden Ass of the good Apuleius. The life of beings is a progressivetransformation whose forms we can determine, renew, conserve for longer, ordestroy sooner. If the idea of metempsychosis423[9781101992746_EPUB-44_fn.xhtml] was true, would we not say that the debauchsymbolized by Circe truly and materially changes men into swine, because thevices in this hypothesis would have as punishment a fall back into the animalforms which correspond to them? Yet metempsychosis, which has often beenmisunderstood, has a side which is perfectly true: the animal forms communicatetheir sympathetic imprints to the astral body of man, which are soon reflectedin his traits, according to the force of his habits. A man of sweet intelligenceand passivity takes on the allure and inert physiognomy of a sheep; it is asheep that we see, as the ecstatic and scholarly Swedenborg tested out athousand times. This mystery is expressed in the Cabalistic book by thevisionary Daniel and by the legend of Nebuchadnezzar who was changed into ananimal, which has been mistaken for a true story, as has happened with almostall magical allegories.Thus we can really change men into animals and animals into men; we canmetamorphose plants and change their virtue; we can give minerals idealproperties: one must only will it.One can also, at will, become visible or invisible, and we will explain here themysteries of the ring of Gyges.Let us first distance from the mind of our readers all supposition of theabsurd, that is to say an effect without cause or contradictory to its cause. Tobecome invisible, one of three things is necessary: either to interpose anopaque medium of some kind between the light and our body, or between our bodyand the eyes of the observers, or to fascinate the eyes of the observers in sucha manner that they cannot make use of their eyesight. Of these three manners ofbecoming invisible, only the third is magic.Have we not often remarked how, under the dominion of a powerful preoccupation,we look without seeing, and we will run into objects that are before our eyes?“Because while seeing they do not see,”424 [9781101992746_EPUB-44__1.xhtml] saidthe great initiator; and the story of this great master teaches us that one day,seeing himself at the point of being stoned to death in the temple, he renderedhimself invisible and departed.425 [9781101992746_EPUB-44__2.xhtml]We will not repeat here the mystifications from the vulgar grimoires about thering of invisibility. Some of them have it made from fixed mercury and tell usto keep it in a box of the same metal, after having inset it with a littlestone, which must infallibly be found in the nest of a hoopoe (instead ofhoopoe, one should read duped-you ).426 [9781101992746_EPUB-44__3.xhtml] Theauthor of the Petit Albert would have us make this ring with the hairs torn froman angry hyena: it is much the same story as that of Rodilard’s little bell.427[9781101992746_EPUB-44__4.xhtml] The only authors who have spoken seriouslyabout the ring of Gyges are Iamblichus, Porphyry, and Pietro d’Abano.What they say about it is obviously allegorical, and the figure that they giveit, or that we can draw based on their descriptions, proves that by the ring ofGyges they mean and indicate nothing other than the great magical arcanum.One of these figures represents the cycle of universal harmonious and balancedmovement in the imperishable being; the other, which one must make from theamalgamation of the seven metals, merits a more detailed description.It must have a double bezel with two precious stones, one of topaz constellatedunder the sign of the Sun, and the other of emerald under the sign of the Moon:within, they must have the occult characters of the planets; and without, theirknown signs, represented twice and in Cabalistic opposition to each other, thatis to say five to the right and five to the left, the signs of the Sun and theMoon summarize the four diverse intelligences of the seven planets. Thisconfiguration is nothing other than the pentacle expressing all the mysteries ofthe magical doctrine, and the symbolic meaning of the ring is that, to exercisethe omnipotence of which ocular fascination is one of the most difficult proofsto provide, one must possess all of the science and know how to make use of it.Fascination operates through magnetism. The mage commands an entire assembly notto see him, and the assembly does not see. He thus enters through guarded doors,he leaves prisons in front of stupefied guards. They experience a kind ofstrange drowsiness, and they remember having seen the mage as though in a dream,but only after he has passed by. The secret of invisibility is thus entirelypart of a power that we can define: that of diverting or paralyzing attention ina way that the light arrives at the visual organ without exciting vision in thesoul.To exercise this power, one must have a will practiced in sudden and energeticacts, a great presence of mind, and no less great a skill in originatingdistractions among the crowds.If a man, for example, who is pursued by assassins, after having veered off ontoa side road, were to suddenly turn about, and head, with a calm expression,towards those who are running after him, or were he to join them and appearpreoccupied with the same pursuit, he would certainly render himself invisible.A priest, who was being chased in 1793 so that he might be hanged from alamppost,428 [9781101992746_EPUB-44__5.xhtml] turned quickly down a street, andthere he lowered his habit and leaned on a boundary stone in the attitude of aman going about his business. The multitude who were chasing him arrived soonafter: they did not see him, or rather none of them recognized him: since it wasso improbable that it could be him!The person who wants to be seen always makes sure he is noticed, and the one whowishes to remain unseen effaces himself and disappears. The will is theveritable ring of Gyges; it is also the wand of transmutations, and it is byformulating it clearly and strongly that it creates the magical Verb. Theomnipotent words of enchantments are those that express this creative power ofthe forms. The Tetragrammaton, which is the supreme word of magic, signifies:what is will be; and, if we apply ourselves to any transformation whatsoeverwith full intelligence, it will renew and modify all things, even despite theevidence and common sense. The hoc est of the Christian sacrifice is atranslation and an application of the Tetragrammaton; these simple words operatethe most complete, the most invisible, the most incredible, and the most clearlyaffirmed of all the transformations. An even more powerful doctrinal word thanthat of transformation was judged necessary by the Council of Trent to expressthis marvel: transubstantiation.The Hebrew words [image/123.jpg],429 [9781101992746_EPUB-44__6.xhtml] wereregarded by all the Cabalists as the keys to transformation magic. The Latinwords est, sit, esto, fiat have the same strength when they are pronounced withfull intelligence. M. de Montalembert recounts most seriously, in his legendabout Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, that one day that pious lady, surprised by hernoble husband, from whom she wished to hide her good works, at the moment whenshe was carrying bread in her apron to the poor, tells him that she is carryingroses, and the verification being made, he finds that she had not lied: thebread was changed into roses. This story is one of the most graceful of magicalapologues and signifies that a true sage does not know how to lie, that the Verbof wisdom determines the form of things or even their substance independent oftheir forms. Why, for example, would not the noble husband of Saint Elizabeth, agood and solid Christian like herself, and who firmly believed in the realpresence of the Savior in true human body on the altar where he only saw a hostmade of flour, believe in the presence of roses in his wife’s apron which hadthe appearance of bread? She shows him bread, without a doubt; but as she hadsaid: They are roses, and since he did not believe her capable of the slightestlie, he saw and only chose to see roses. There is the secret of this miracle.Another legend regards a saint whose name I forget, who finds himself withnothing to eat except a chicken; it being Lent or a Friday, he commands thechicken to be a fish, and he made it a fish. This parable needs no commentaryand reminds us of a beautiful remark from Saint Spyridon of Tremetousia, thesame one who evoked the soul of his daughter Irene. A traveler arrives on aFriday at this good bishop’s house, and since in that time the bishops, who tookChristianity seriously, were poor, Spyridon, who regularly fasted, has only somesalted lard in the house, which was being prepared for Easter. Nevertheless,since the stranger was exhausted with fatigue and hunger, Spyridon presented himwith this meat, and, to encourage him to eat it, he sat down at the table withhim and shared this repast of charity, thus transforming the flesh that theIsraelites regarded as the most impure into a feast of penitence, placinghimself above the material aspect of the law through the spirit of the lawitself by showing himself to be a true and intelligent disciple of the man-god,who established the chosen kings of nature in the three worlds."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVTHE SABBATH OF THE SORCERERSHere we have returned to that terrible number, fifteen, which, in the clavicleof the Tarot, presents the symbol of a monster standing on an altar, wearing amiter and horns, having the breasts of a woman and genitals of a man, a chimera,a deformed sphinx, a synthesis of monstrosity; and above this figure we can reada completely frank and naive inscription: THE DEVIL.Yes, here we deal with the phantom of all terrors, the dragon of all thetheogonies, the Ahriman of the Persians, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Pythonof the Greeks, the ancient serpent of the Hebrews, the wyvern, the graoully, thetarasque,430 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_fn.xhtml] the gargoyle, the great beast ofthe Middle Ages, and worse yet than all of those, the Baphomet of the Templars,the bearded idol of the alchemists, the obscene god of Mendes, the goat of theSabbath.We provide as the frontispiece of this Ritual the exact figure of this terribleemperor of the night with all his attributes and all his characters.431[9781101992746_EPUB-45_11.xhtml]Let us say now, for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction ofMonsieur the Count de Mirville, for the justification of Bodin the demonomaniac,for the greatest glory of the Church, which persecuted the Templars, burnt themagicians, excommunicated the Freemasons, etc., etc.; let us boldly and loudlysay that all the initiates into the occult sciences (I speak here of the lesserinitiates and the profaners of the great arcanum) adored, still adore, and willalways adore what is symbolized by this terrifying symbol.[image/Doctrine_Magic_23.jpg]Yes, it is our profound conviction that the Grand Masters of the Order of theTemplars adored Baphomet and made their initiates adore him; yes, there existedand might still exist assemblies presided over by that figure, sitting on athrone with his ardent torch between his horns; only the adorers of this sign donot think, as we do, that it is the representation of the devil but that of thegod Pan, the god of our schools of modern philosophy, the god of the theurgistsof the school of Alexandria and of the mystic Neoplatonists of our day, the godof Lamartine432 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_15.xhtml] and of Victor Cousin,433[9781101992746_EPUB-45_16.xhtml] the god of Spinoza and of Plato, the god of theprimordial Gnostic schools; the actual Christ of the dissident priesthood; andthat last qualification given to the goat of black magic will not surprise thosewho study religious antiquities and have followed in their diversetransformations the phases of symbolism and of doctrine either in India, or inEgypt, or in Judea.The bull, the dog, and the goat are the three symbolic animals of Hermeticmagic, in which are summarized all the traditions of Egypt and of India. Thebull represents the earth or the philosopher’s salt; the dog is Hermanubis, theMercury of the sages, the fluid, the air and the water; the goat represents thefire, and he is at the same time the symbol of regeneration.In Judea they consecrated two goats, one pure, the other impure. The pure onewas sacrificed in expiation for sins; the other, charged through imprecationwith these same sins, was freed into the desert.434[9781101992746_EPUB-45_17.xhtml] A strange thing, but of profound symbolism!Reconciliation through devotion and expiation through liberty! Yet all thefathers who occupied themselves with Jewish symbolism recognized in theirimmolated goat the figure of the one who took away, they say, the form itself ofsin. Thus the Gnostics were not outside the symbolic traditions when they gaveChrist the liberator the mystical figure of the goat.All of the Cabala and all of magic in fact share the cult of the sacrificialgoat and that of the emissary goat. Thus there is the magic of the sanctuary andthe magic of the desert, the white church and the black church, the priesthoodof public assemblies and the Sanhedrin of the Sabbath.The goat which is represented on our frontispiece has the sign of the pentagramon his forehead point upwards, which suffices for it to be a symbol of thelight; with his two hands he makes the sign of occultism, and points above tothe white moon of Chesed, and below to the black moon of Geburah. This signexpresses the perfect accord between mercy and justice. One of his arms isfeminine, the other masculine, like Khunrath’s androgyne whose attributes we hadto unite with our goat, since it is the unique and same symbol. The torch ofintelligence which shines between his horns is the magical light of universalequilibrium; it is also the figure of the soul risen above matter, even thoughit comes from matter, as the flame rises from the torch. The hideous animal headexpresses the horror of sin, for which the material agent, solely responsiblefor it, must forever carry the punishment: because the soul is imperturbable bynature and can only suffer by materializing. The caduceus, which takes the placeof the generative organ, represents eternal life; the belly covered in scales iswater; the circle which is above is the atmosphere; the feathers which comethereafter are the emblem of the volatile; then humanity is represented by thetwo breasts and the androgynous arms of the sphinx of the occult sciences.Thus is the darkness of the infernal sanctuary dissipated, thus is the sphinx ofthe terrors of the Middle Ages surmised and thrown off his throne; quomodocecidisti, Lucifer?435 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_18.xhtml] The terrible Baphomet isno more, like all those other monstrous idols, enigmas of the ancient scienceand its dreams, it is but an innocent and even pious hieroglyph. How could manhave adored the beast, since he exerts a sovereign empire over it? Let us say,for the honor of humanity, that it never adored dogs and goats more than lambsand pigeons. In terms of hieroglyphs, why a goat rather than a lamb? On thesacred stones of the Gnostic Christians of the sect of Basilides,436[9781101992746_EPUB-45_19.xhtml] we see representations of the Christ as diverseanimal figures from the Cabala; sometimes a bull, sometimes a lion, sometimes aserpent with the head of a lion or of a bull; everywhere he has the sameattributes of light, like our goat whose sign of the pentagram stops one fromtaking him for a fabulous image of Satan.Let us say it aloud, to combat against the remains of Manichaeism which stillarise in our time among Christians,437 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_20.xhtml] thatSatan as a superior personality and as a power does not exist. Satan is thepersonification of all errors, of all perversity, and in consequence of allweakness. If God can be defined as he who necessarily exists, can we not definehis antagonist and his enemy as he who necessarily does not exist?The absolute affirmation of good implies the absolute negation of evil; in thelight the shadow itself is luminous. It is thus that lost spirits are goodwherever they are in truth where they must be. There are no shadows withoutreflections, nor nights without a moon, without phosphor and without stars. Ifhell is justice, it is good. No one has ever blasphemed God. The insults andmocking that are addressed to those disfigured images do not reach him.We have just named Manichaeism, and it is through this monstrous heresy that wewill explain the aberrations of black magic. The doctrine of Zoroastermisunderstood the magical law of the two forces which constitute universalequilibrium, and caused a few illogical minds to imagine a negative divinity,subordinate but hostile to the active divinity. It is thus that the impurebinary was formed. We had the folly to split God; the star of Solomon wasseparated into two triangles, and the Manichaeans imagined a trinity of thenight. This evil god, born of the imagination of sectarians, became the inspirerof all follies and of all crimes. They offered him bloody sacrifices; monstrousidolatry replaced true religion; black magic defamed the high and luminous magicof the true adepts, and in the caverns and deserts horrible conventicles ofsorcerers, ghouls, and stryges took place: because dementia soon transforms intofrenzy, and from human sacrifice to cannibalism is but one step.The mysteries of the Sabbath were diversely told, but they always appear in thegrimoires and in the court trials against magic. We can divide all therevelations which have been made regarding this subject into three types: first,those that talk of a fantastic and imaginary Sabbath; second, those that betraythe secrets of the occult assemblies of true adepts; third, the revelations ofmad and criminal assemblies whose object was the practice of black magic.For a great number of unfortunate men and woman given to mad and abominablepractices, the Sabbath was but a long nightmare whose dreams seemed like realityto them, and which they achieved through the use of drinks, fumigations, andnarcotic frictions. Della Porta, whom we have already indicated as a mystifier,provides in his Magia Naturalis the supposed recipe for the unguent of thewitches, by means of which they traveled to the Sabbath. It is composed ofchild’s fat, aconite boiled with poplar leaves, and a few other drugs; then hewants us to mix in some chimney soot, which must render the naked witches whoshow up at these Sabbaths rubbed all over with this ointment ratherunattractive. Here is another more serious recipe also provided by della Portaand that we transcribe here in Latin to leave it in all its grimoire style:Recipe: suim, acorum vulgare, pentaphyllon, verspertillionis sanguinem, solanumsomniferum et oleum,438 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_21.xhtml] and all boiled andmixed together until it reaches the consistency of an unguent.We think that opiates like the heart of green cannabis, Datura stramonium, andthe cherry laurel would enter with no less success into such compositions. Thefat or blood of birds of the night, added to these narcotics with the ceremoniesof black magic, can strike the imagination and determine the direction ofdreams. It is at Sabbaths dreamed up in this manner that one must attribute thestories of goats that arise from a jug and then reenter it after the ceremony,the infernal powders collected behind this same goat, called Master Leonard,439[9781101992746_EPUB-45__1.xhtml] the banquets where they eat the unsalted,boiled remains of abortions with serpents and toads, the dances where the imagesof monstrous animals or impossibly deformed men and women appear, the freneticorgies where incubi produce a cold semen. Only nightmares can produce suchthings and only they can explain them. The unfortunate priest Gaufridi and hisdebauched penitent, Madeleine de la Palud, became mad due to such reveries, andcompromised themselves until they were brought before the pyre. One must readthe trial and depositions of these poor lunatics to understand just what kind ofaberrations one can be transported to by a wounded imagination. But the Sabbathwas not always a dream, and it really existed; there even still exist now secretand nocturnal assemblies, some of which are of religious character with a socialgoal, others which are conjurations and orgies. It is from this dual viewpointthat we shall consider and describe the true Sabbath, either of the magic oflight or of the magic of darkness.When Christianity proscribed the public exercise of the ancient cults, itreduced the partisans of religion to meeting in secret to celebrate theirmysteries. At these meetings there presided initiates who soon establishedbetween the diverse nuances of these persecuted cults a conviction that magicaltruth would aid them even more readily, because proscription reunited theirwills and tightened the fraternal links between men. Thus the mysteries of Isis,of the Eleusinian Ceres, of Bacchus were reunited with those of the Bona Dea440[9781101992746_EPUB-45__2.xhtml] and primordial Druidism. The assemblies wereordinarily held between the days of Mercury and Jupiter, or between those ofVenus and Saturn; they occupied themselves with the rites of initiation, theyexchanged mysterious signs, they sang symbolic hymns, they united aroundbanquets, and they successively formed the magical chain around tables andthrough dance; then they separated after having renewed their obligationsbetween the hands of their leaders and having received the leader’sinstructions. The initiate of the Sabbath had to be brought, or rather carried,to the assembly with his eyes covered by a magic coat, with which he wasentirely wrapped; they made him pass over great fires, and they made terrifyingnoises around him. When he uncovered his face, he saw himself surrounded byinfernal monsters and in the presence of a colossal and monstrous goat, whomthey enjoined him to adore. All these ceremonies were trials of strength ofcharacter and confidence in the initiators. The last trial was the mostdecisive, because it presented above all to the mind of the recipient somethinghumiliating and ridiculous: he had to respectfully kiss the behind of the goat,and the neophyte was commanded to do so very bluntly. If he refused, theyre-veiled his head and transported him far from the assembly with such rapiditythat he believed he was being driven on clouds; if he accepted, they had himturn around the symbolic idol, and he found, not a repulsive and obscene object,but the young and graceful visage of a priestess of Isis or of Maya, who gavehim a maternal kiss; and then he was admitted to the banquet.As to the orgies which, in several assemblies of this type, followed thebanquet, one must not believe that they were generally accepted in these secretfeasts; but we know that several Gnostic sects practiced them in theirconventicles as of the first centuries of Christianity. That the flesh had itsdefenders in the centuries of asceticism and repression of the senses had to beso and does not surprise us; but one should not accuse high magic of imbalancesit never authorized. Isis is chaste in her widowhood; Diana Panthea is a virgin;Hermanubis, being of both sexes, can satisfy neither; the hermetic Hermaphroditeis chaste. Apollonius of Tyana never abandoned himself to the seductions ofpleasure; the emperor Julian was of a severe chastity; Plotinus of Alexandriawas strict with regard to his ascetic morals; Paracelsus was such a stranger tomad loves that they believed he was of doubtful sex; Raymond Lully was onlyinitiated into the last secrets of the science after a despondency due to love,which rendered him forever chaste.It is also a tradition of high magic that pentacles and talismans lose all theirvirtue when he who carries them takes them to a house of prostitution or commitsadultery. The orgiastic Sabbath must therefore not be considered as onebelonging to veritable adepts.As to the actual name of the Sabbath, some have wished to derive it from thename of Sabazius; others have imagined other etymologies. The simplest,according to us, is the one which has this word come from the Jewish Sabbath,since it is certain that the Jews, the most faithful guardians of the secrets ofthe Cabala, were almost always with regard to magic the great masters of theMiddle Ages.The Sabbath was thus always on a Sunday for the Cabalists, the day of theirreligious feast or rather the night of their regular assembly. This feast,surrounded in mystery, had as a safeguard the fears of the vulgar themselves andescaped persecution through terror.As to the diabolical Sabbath of the necromancers, it was a counterfeit of themage’s Sabbath and an assembly of evildoers who exploited idiots and the insane.They practiced terrible rites there and composed abominable mixtures. Thesorcerers and sorceresses were their own police and informed themselvesregarding one another in order to mutually support their reputation for prophecyand divination, because seers at that time were generally consulted and had alucrative profession while exercising veritable influence.These assemblies of sorcerers and sorceresses, incidentally, did not possess andcould not possess the regular rites: all depended on the caprices of the leadersand the giddiness of the assembly. That which was recounted by those who wereable to assist served as a model for all the nightmares of dreamers, and it isfrom the combination of these impossible realities and these demoniacal dreamsthat were issued the disgusting and stupid stories about the Sabbath that figurein the procedures of magic in books by Sprenger, de Lancre, Delrio, andBodin.441 [9781101992746_EPUB-45__3.xhtml]The rites of the Gnostic Sabbath were transmitted in Germany to an associationwhich took the name of Mopses;442 [9781101992746_EPUB-45__4.xhtml] they replacedthe Cabalistic goat with the hermetic dog, and at the reception of male orfemale candidates (because the order admitted ladies), they bring themblindfolded; they make those infernal noises around them which makes people giveit the name of Sabbath due to all the inexplicable rumors; they ask them if theyare afraid of the devil; then they brusquely propose that they choose betweenkissing the backside of the master or that of Mops, who is a little figure of adog covered in silk, and the substitute for the ancient grand idol of the goatof Mendes. The Mopses have as a sign of recognition which is a ridiculousgrimace that reminds one of the phantasmagorias of the ancient Sabbath and themasks of its assistants. For the rest, their doctrine is summarized by the cultof love and of liberty. This association was produced when the Roman Churchpersecuted the Freemasons. The Mopses claimed that they recruited onlyCatholics, and they substituted the oath of reception with a solemn promise ontheir honor not to reveal any of the secrets of the association. It was nothingmore than a promise, and religion no longer had anything to do with it.The Baphomet of the Templars, whose name should be spelled Cabalistically and inthe inverse, is composed of three abbreviations: TEM OHP AB, Templi omniumhominum pacis abbas, father of the temple, the universal peace of men.443[9781101992746_EPUB-45__5.xhtml] Baphomet was, according to some, a monstroushead; according to others, a demon in the form of a goat. A sculpted coffer wasrecently disinterred from the ruins of an old temple commandery, and antiquarieshad observed within it a Baphometic figure which conforms in its attributes toour goat of Mendes and to Khunrath’s androgyne.444[9781101992746_EPUB-45__6.xhtml] This figure is bearded with the entire body ofa woman; she holds in one hand the sun, and in the other the moon, attached tochains. It is a beautiful allegory that this virile head attributes to thoughtalone the principal initiator and creator. The head, here, represents the mind,and the female body represents matter. The celestial bodies enchained to thehuman form and directed by that nature whose intelligence is the head also offera most beautiful allegory. The symbol, in its ensemble, was nonetheless found tobe obscene and diabolical by the scholars who examined it. It is no wonder,after that, to see the superstitions from the Middle Ages still being accreditedin our day! One single thing surprises me, it is that, believing in the deviland his minions, we do not light the pyres back up. M. Veuillot445[9781101992746_EPUB-45__7.xhtml] would like us to do so, and he is the mostlogical of them: one should always honor men who have the courage of theiropinions.Let us continue our curious researches and arrive at the most horrible mysteriesof the grimoire, those regarding the evocation of devils and pacts with hell.After having attributed a real existence to the absolute negation of good, afterhaving enthroned the absurd and created a god of lies, there but remained forhuman folly to invoke this impossible idol, and that is what the madmen did.Someone wrote us recently to say that the respectable Father Ventura, formersuperior of the Theatine order, examiner of the bishops, etc., after having readour Doctrine, had declared that the Cabala, in his eyes, was the invention ofthe devil, and that the star of Solomon was another ruse by that same devil topersuade the world that he, the devil, is one with God. And there we have whatis seriously taught by those who are the masters in Israel! The ideal of thevoid and the darkness inventing a sublime philosophy which is the universalbasis for the faith and the cornerstone of all the temples! The demon apposinghis signature besides that of God! My venerable masters in theology, you aremore sorcerous than is thought and then you think yourselves, and he who saidthe devil is a liar and so is his father would perhaps have just few things tosay regarding the decisions as to your paternity.Those who evoke the devil must before all else belong to the religion whichadmits to a creator devil and rival of God. To address oneself to such a power,one must believe in it. Given a firm believer in the religion of the devil, hereis how he must proceed in order to correspond with this pseudogod:MAGICAL AXIOMWithin the circle of their action, all verbs create what they affirm.DIRECT CONSEQUENCEHe who affirms the devil creates or makes the devil.WHAT ONE NEEDS TO SUCCEED IN INFERNAL EVOCATIONS.First, invincible stubbornness;Second, a conscience which is both hardened to crime and very accessible toremorse and fear;Third, an affected or natural ignorance;Fourth, a blind faith in everything that cannot be believed;Fifth, a completely false idea of God.ONE MUST THEN:First, profane the ceremonies of the cult in which you believe and trample themost sacred signs under your feet;Second, make a bloody sacrifice;Third, procure a magic fork. It is a single branch of hazel wood or almond woodthat one must cut off with a single cut using a new knife which had served forthe sacrifice; the stick must end in a fork; you cover this wood fork in iron orsteel made from the blade of the same knife you used to cut it.You must fast for fourteen days, having only one meal without salt after the Sunhas set; this meal will be of black bread and blood seasoned with spices withoutsalt, or of black beans, and milky and narcotic weeds;Every five days you get drunk, after sunset, with wine in which you have infusedfive heads of black poppy and five ounces of ground cannabis seeds for fivehours: all of it contained in a cloth that has been spun by a female prostitute(in a pinch, the first cloth you come by could be used if it was spun by awoman).The evocation can be performed either during the night of Monday to Tuesday, orthat of Friday to Saturday.You must choose a solitary and detested spot, such as a cemetery haunted by evilspirits, a feared ruin in the countryside, the basement of an abandoned convent,the place where a murder was committed, a Druidic altar, or an ancient temple ofidols.You must provide yourself with a black robe without seams or sleeves; a leadskullcap constellated with the signs of the Moon, of Venus, and Saturn, twocandles made from human lard fitted into candlesticks of black wood cut into theform of a crescent, two crowns of verbena; a magical sword with a black handle;the magical fork; a copper vase containing the blood of the victim, an incenseholder containing perfumes, which will be of frankincense, camphor, aloe,ambergris, and storax mixed and kneaded with the blood of goat, mole, and bat;you must also have four nails torn from the coffin of a torture victim, the headof a black cat who was fed human flesh for five days, a bat drowned in blood,the horns of a goat cum quo puella concubuerit,446[9781101992746_EPUB-45__8.xhtml] and the skull of a parricide. Once all thesehorrible and rather difficult to gather objects are united, here is how you usethem:You draw a perfect circle with the sword while leaving a break or an exit; inthe circle you inscribe a triangle, you color the pentacle that the sword drewwith blood; then, at one of the points of the triangle, you place a brazier withthree feet, which we should also have counted in our list of indispensableitems; at the opposite base of the triangle you draw three little circles forthe operator and his assistants, and behind the operator’s circle you draw, notwith the blood of the victim, but with the blood of the operator himself, thesign of the labarum, or Constantine’s monogram. The operator or his acolytesmust be barefoot and have their heads covered.You will also have brought the immolated skin of the victim; this skin, cut intobands, will be placed in the circle and will form another interior circle whichwill be fixed at four corners with the four nails of the torture victim; nearthe four nails and outside the circle you will place the head of the cat, thehuman, or rather inhuman, skull, the goat horns, and the bat; you will sprinklethem with a roll of birch bark dipped in the blood of the victim, then you willlight a fire of alder wood and cypress; the two magical candles will be placedto the right and left of the operator in the crowns of verbena. (See the figureat the head of this chapter.)You will then pronounce the formulas of evocation which are found in the magicalelements of Pietro d’Abano or in the grimoires, either manuscripts or printed.The one in the Grand Grimoire, repeated in the vulgar Dragon Rouge, waspurposely altered in the published version. Here it is as it should be read:“Per Adonai Elohim, Adonai Jehovah, Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla AdonaiMathon, verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae, conventus sylphorum, antragnomorum, daemonia coeli, Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jeheshua, Evan, Zariatnatmik,veni, veni, veni.”447 [9781101992746_EPUB-45__9.xhtml]The great appellation of Agrippa only consists of these words: DIES MIES JESCHETBOENEDOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS.448 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_10.xhtml] We do notflatter ourselves by claiming we understand the meaning of these words, whichperhaps have none, and should not have any which are reasonable, since they havethe power to evoke the devil, who is sovereign unreason.Pico della Mirandola, no doubt with the same motive, affirms that in black magicthe most barbaric and most absolutely unintelligible words are the best and mostefficacious.The conjurations are repeated while raising one’s voice, along with imprecationsand threats, until the spirit responds. He is ordinarily preceded, when he isabout to appear, by a violent wind that seems to make the entire countrysidehowl. Domestic animals tremble and hide; the assistants feel a breath on theirfaces, and their hair, damp with a cold sweat, stands on end.The great and supreme appellation, according to Pietro d’Abano, is as follows:Hemen-Etan! Hemen-Etan! Hemen-Etan! El* ATI* TITEIP* AZIA* HYN* MINOSEL*ACHADON* yay* vaa* Eye* Aaa* Eie* Exe* A EL EL EL A* HY! HAU! HAU! HAU! HAU! VA!VA! VA! VA! CHAVAJOTH.Aie Seraye, Aie Seraye, Aie Seraye!

Chavajoth!Impero tibi per clavem SOLOMONIS et nomen magnum SHEMHAMPHORASH.Here are the ordinary signs and signatures of the demons:[image/Doctrine_Magic_24.jpg]These are the signatures of simple demons; here are the official signatures ofthe princes of hell, signatures which were juridically witnessed (juridically! Omonsieur. Count de Mirville!) and conserved in the judiciary archives likeproofs of guilt for the trial of the unfortunate Urbain Grandier.[image/Doctrine_Magic_25.jpg]These signatures are apposed at the bottom of a pact which M. Collin dePlancy449 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_12.xhtml] provided as a facsimile in thelinguistic atlas of his Infernal Dictionary, and which has as a marginal note:“the official record is in hell, in Lucifer’s cabinet,” a rather precious pieceof information regarding a very poorly known locale and from an era still soclose to ours, anterior however to the trial of the young La Barre andd’Etallonde,450 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_13.xhtml] who, as everyone knows, werethe contemporaries of Voltaire.Evocations were often followed by pacts, which were written on the skinparchment of a goat with an iron pen and a drop of blood, which had to be takenfrom the left arm. The debt agreement was written in two copies: the cleverdemon took one with him, and the voluntarily condemned swallowed the other. Thereciprocal promises were for the demon to serve the sorcerer during a certainnumber of years and for the sorcerer to belong to the demon after a certaindetermined time. The Church, with its exorcisms, consecrated the belief in allthese things, and one could say that black magic and its dark prince are a real,living, and terrible creation of Roman Catholicism; that they are even theChurch’s special and characteristic work, since their priests did not inventGod. Also, true Catholics hold at the bottom of their hearts to theconservation, even to the regeneration, of this Great Work which is thephilosopher’s stone of the official and positive cult. They say that, injailhouse lingo, evildoers call the devil the baker: all our desire, and here weare not speaking as a mage but as a devoted child of Christianity and theChurch, to which we owe our primary education and our first enthusiasms; all ourdesire, we were saying, is that the phantom of Satan might no longer also becalled the baker of ministers of morality and of the representatives of thehighest virtue. Will they understand our thinking, and will they pardon us ourboldness and our aspirations in favor of our devote intentions and the sincerityof our faith?The magic which creates the demon is that magic which dictated the Grimoire ofPope Honorius, the Enchiridion of Leon III, the exorcisms of the Roman Ritual,the sentences of the Inquisitors, the indictments of Laubardement, the articlesof the brothers Veuillot, the books of de Falloux, de Montalembert, and deMirville:451 [9781101992746_EPUB-45_14.xhtml] the magic of sorcerers and of“pious men” who are in fact nothing of the kind, something which is trulycondemnable for some and infinitely deplorable for others. It is most of all tocombat, by revealing them, these sad aberrations of the human spirit that wehave published this book. May it aid in the success of this holy work!But we have yet to show these impious works in all their turpitude and in alltheir monstrous folly; one must stir up the bloody mud of past superstitions,one must consult through the annals of demonomania, to understand certainheinous crimes that imagination alone would not invent. The Cabalist Bodin, aJew by conviction and a Catholic by necessity, had no other intention, with hisDemonomania of the Sorcerers, than to attack Catholicism with these works and toundermine it with the greatest of all abuses of its doctrine. The work of Bodinis profoundly Machiavellian and strikes at the heart of the institutions of manwhich it pretends to defend. We would have great difficulty imagining, withouthaving read it, all the hideous and bloody things he collected and piled up:acts of revolting superstition, arrests and executions of ferocious stupidity.“Burn them all!” So the Inquisitors seemed to say. “God will recognize his own!”Poor madmen, hysterical women, idiots were burned without mercy for the crime ofmagic; but there were also great culprits who escaped this unjust and sanguinaryjustice! That is what Bodin would have us understand when he tells us anecdotesof the type which he places around the death of Charles IX. It is a little knownabomination which has not yet, as far as we know, even in the eras of the mostfeverish and dreadful literature, tempted the verve of any novelist.Suffering from a malady whose causes no physician could discover and whoseterrible symptoms none could explain, King Charles IX was about to die. TheQueen Mother, who governed entirely and who could lose everything under anotherreign; the Queen Mother, who was suspected of being the cause of this malady,against her own interests, because they always supposed this woman capable ofanything, of hidden ruses and unknown interests, first consulted the king’sastrologers, then took recourse in the most detestable of magics. The state ofthe patient worsened every day and was becoming desperate; they decided toconsult the oracle of the Bloody Head, and here is how they proceeded with thisinfernal operation:They took a child, with beautiful face and of innocent virtue; they had himprepared in secret for his first communion by a palace chaplain; then, on theday in question, or rather the night of the sacrifice, a monk, a Jacobinapostate dedicated to the occult works of black magic, began at midnight, in theroom of the patient, and in the sole presence of Catherine de Médicis and herminions, what was then called the Mass of the Devil.At this Mass, celebrated before the image of the demon, having under his feet anupturned cross, the sorcerer consecrated two hosts, one black and one white. Thewhite one was given to the child, whom they had brought there dressed as thoughfor a baptism, and whose throat was cut on the steps of the altar right afterhis communion. His head, detached from the torso in a single cut, was placed,still twitching, on the large black host which covered the bottom of the sacredcup, and then was brought to a table where mysterious lamps burned. The exorcismthen began, and the demon was commanded to pronounce an oracle and to answerthrough the mouth of that child’s head to a secret question that the king didnot dare speak aloud and had not even mentioned to anyone. And then a weakvoice, a strange inhuman voice, was heard coming from the head of that poormartyr. “I am forced,” said this voice in Latin: Vim patior. At that response,which no doubt announced to the patient that hell no longer protected him, aterrible trembling seized him, his arms stiffened. . . . He then cried out in ahoarse voice: “Take away that head! take away that head!” and right up to hislast breath no one heard him say anything else. Those who served him, and whowere unaware of this awful mystery, believed he was being pursued by the ghostof Coligny and that he thought he saw before him the head of that illustriousadmiral, but what excited the dying man was no longer remorse, it was thehopeless fear of an anticipated hell.This black magical legend of Bodin’s reminds one of the abominable practices andthe well-merited tortures of Gilles de Laval, lord of Rais, who went fromasceticism to black magic and gave himself over, in order to enter into the goodgraces of Satan, to the most revolting of sacrifices. This madman declaredduring his trial that Satan had often appeared to him but had always cheated himby promising him treasures which he never then provided. From this trial, thereresulted the juridical information that several hundred unfortunate children hadbeen victims of the cupidity and atrocious imagination of this murderer."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIENCHANTMENTS AND SPELLSWhat the sorcerers and necromancers sought most of all with their evocations ofthe impure spirit was that magnetic power which is the allotment of the trueadept, and which they wanted to usurp in order to shamefully abuse it.The folly of the sorcerers was an evil madness; one of their primary goals wasthe power of enchantments or deleterious influences.We have said in our “Doctrine” what we think of these enchantments, and theextent to which this power appears to us to be dangerous and real. The true mageenchants those whom he disapproves of, and whom he believes should be punished,without ceremonies and solely through his condemnation; he enchants even thosewho do him harm, through his forgiveness, and the enemies of initiates willnever get away with their injustices for very long. We ourselves have observednumerous examples of this fatal law. The hangmen of the martyrs always perish inunfortunate circumstances, and the adepts are the martyrs of intelligence; butProvidence seems to despise those who despise them and has killed those who lookto prevent them from living. The legend of the Wandering Jew is the popularpoetry of this arcanum. A people had sent a sage to his torture; they told him:“Walk!” when he wanted to rest a moment. Well! that people will suffer a similarcondemnation, it will be entirely proscribed, and for centuries they will betold: “Walk! Walk!” without finding any pity or rest.A learned man had a wife whom he loved madly and passionately in the exaltationof his tenderness, and he honored her with his blind faith and relied on her foreverything. Vain, with her beauty and her intelligence, this woman becameenvious of the superiority of her husband and began to hate him. After sometime, she left him and compromised herself with an ugly, spiritless, and immoralold man. That was her first punishment, but that is not where her sentence wouldend. The learned man spoke this single sentence against her: “I rebuke yourintelligence and your beauty.” One year later, those who encountered her couldalready not recognize her; a chubbiness had begun to disfigure her; shereflected in her face the ugliness of her new affections. Three years later shewas ugly; seven years after that she was mad. This occurred in our time, and weknew both persons.Mages condemn in the manner of skillful doctors, and that is why we cannotappeal their sentences once they have pronounced a warrant against a guiltyperson. They do not need ceremonies or invocations; they need only abstain fromeating at the same table as the condemned, and if they are forced to sit at thattable, they should neither accept nor offer him salt.The enchantments of sorcerers are of another kind and can be compared to actualpoisonings of the current of the astral light. They exalt their will throughceremonies to the point of rendering it venomous at a distance; but, as wealready noted in our “Doctrine,” they most often expose themselves to beingkilled first by their infernal machinations. Let us criticize here several oftheir shameful procedures. They procure either the hairs or the clothing of theperson they wish to curse; then they choose an animal who in their eyes is thesymbol of that person; through the hairs or clothing they magnetically link thatanimal to the person; they give it their name, then they kill it with a singlecut of a magical knife, they open the chest, tear out the heart, envelop thestill beating heart in magnetized objects, and for three days, at all hours,they thrust nails, needles heated in fire, or long thorns into the heart, whilepronouncing curses upon the enchanted person’s name. They are then persuaded(and often with reason) that the victim of their odious operations goes throughas many tortures as though they actually had all those points stuck into theirheart. The victim begins to waste away and, after a time, dies of an unknownmalady.Another enchantment used in the countryside consists of consecrating nails forworks of hatred with the stinking fumigations of Saturn and the invocations ofevil spirits, and then you follow behind the person you wish to torment and nailin the form of the cross all the marks of their footsteps that you can find inthe ground or the sand.Another more abominable enchantment is practiced like this: you take a largetoad, and you baptize it with the last and first names of the person you wish tocurse; you then have the toad swallow a consecrated host upon which you havepronounced formulas of execration; then you envelop the toad in magnetizedobjects, you link it with hairs of the victim, upon which the operator had firstspit, and you bury it all either under the threshold of the cursed person’s dooror in a place where they are obliged to pass over every day. The elementaryspirit of this toad becomes a nightmare and a vampire in that person’s dreams,unless he knows how to send them back to the culprit.Then come enchantments through wax images. The necromancers of the Middle Ages,who jealously guarded their ability to please through sacrilege those whom theysaw as their masters, mixed in with this wax baptismal oil and the ashes ofburnt hosts; there were always apostate priests to be found who raided thetreasuries of the Church. They formed with this cursed wax an image whichresembled as much as possible the person they wished to enchant; they dressedthis image in similar clothes to his, they gave it the same sacraments as he hadalso received, then they pronounced over the head of the image all themaledictions which expressed the sorcerer’s hatred, and every day they inflictedimaginary tortures on this figure, to attack and torment through sympathy he orshe whom the figure represented.Enchantment is more infallible if one can procure the hairs, the blood, and bestof all a tooth from the enchanted person. It is what gave rise to thatproverbial way of speaking: “You have a tooth against me.”452[9781101992746_EPUB-46_fn.xhtml]One also enchants through the eyes, and this is what they call the jettatura inItaly, or the evil eye. In the times of our civil discords, a shop owner had thebad idea of denouncing one of his neighbors. The neighbor, after being heldunder arrest for some time, was released, but he had lost his position. For hisonly revenge, he passed in front of the shop of his denouncer twice a day,stared at him fixedly, greeted him, and went past. After a time, the shop owner,no longer able to tolerate the torment of his stare, sold his shop at a loss andchanged neighborhoods without leaving his address; in a word, he was ruined.A threat is a real enchantment, because it acts strongly upon the imagination,especially if that imagination easily accepts the belief in unlimited occultpower. The terrible threat of hell, humanity’s enchantment over severalcenturies, created more nightmares, more sicknesses without name, more furiousfollies than all the vices and all excesses combined. This is what the hermeticartists of the Middle Ages symbolized with their incredible and unheard ofmonsters which they inlayed in the doorways of their basilicas.But enchantment through threats produces an effect absolutely contrary to theintentions of the operator when the threat is obviously vain, when it revoltsthe legitimate pride of he who is threatened and in consequence provokes hisresistance, and lastly when it is ridiculous because it is overly terrible.It is the sectarians of hell who discredited heaven. Tell a reasonable man thatequilibrium is the law of the movement of life and that moral equilibrium, andfreedom, rest upon the eternal and immutable distinction between truth andfalsity, between good and evil; tell him that, graced with free will, he mustfind his place through his works in the empire of the truth and the good, oreternally fall down, like the rock of Sisyphus into the chaos of lies and evil:he will understand this doctrine, and if you call the truth and the good heavenlies and evil hell, he will believe in your heaven and your hell, above whichthe ideal divinity remains calm, perfect, and as inaccessible to anger as toinsult, because he will understand that if hell in principle is eternal likeliberty, it could be no more than a passing torment for souls, since it is anexpiation, and that the idea of expiation necessarily supposes that ofreparation and the destruction of evil.This is said, not with dogmatic intentions, which could never be our motivation,but to indicate the reasonable and moral remedy for enchantments of consciencethrough the terrors of the next life. Let us now speak of the means of escapingthe deadly influences of human anger.The primary means is to be reasonable and just, and to never offer anopportunity or reason for anger. A legitimate anger is something to be veryafraid of. That is why you should hurry to recognize and expiate your faults. Ifthe anger persists after that, it certainly derives from a vice: look to findwhich vice, and strongly unite yourself with the contrary virtue. Theenchantment will thereafter have no power over you.Wash your towels and the clothes you have made use of carefully before givingthem away, or burn them; never use an item of clothing that was used by someoneunknown to you without having purified it with water, with sulfur, and withscents, such as camphor, incense, amber, etc.A great means of resisting enchantment is to not fear it: enchantment acts inthe manner of contagious sicknesses. In time of plague, those who are afraid arestruck first. The means to not fear evil is to not be preoccupied by it, andwith complete disinterest, since it is in a book on magic I have written that Iplace such counsel, I strongly advise nervous persons, the weak, the credulous,hysterics, the superstitious, the sanctimonious, idiots, the lazy, and those wholack willpower never to open a book on magic, to close this one if they haveopened it, and never to listen to those who speak of the occult sciences, indeedto make fun of them, to refuse to believe and to “drink al fresco,”453[9781101992746_EPUB-46__1.xhtml] as was said by the great Pantagruelistmagician, the excellent priest of Meudon.454 [9781101992746_EPUB-46__2.xhtml]As for sages, and it is time for us to occupy ourselves with them after havingdealt with the madmen, there are few curses they fear other than those of fate;but since they are priests and doctors, they can be called upon to cure curses,and here is how they must do so:One must get the enchanted person to do something good for the enchanter, renderhim a service which he cannot refuse, and work towards bringing him, eitherdirectly or indirectly, to the communion of salt.455[9781101992746_EPUB-46__3.xhtml]A person who believes himself to be enchanted by the execration and burial of atoad must carry with them a living toad in a box made of horn.For an enchantment by pierced heart, one must make the sickened person eat theheart of a lamb seasoned with sage and verbena, and have him carry a talisman ofVenus or of the Moon in a small bag filled with camphor and salt.For enchantment by wax figurine, one must make a more perfect figurine, give iteverything of the enchanted person they can give it, put the seven talismansaround its neck, place it in the middle of a large pentacle representing thepentagram, and rub it lightly every day with a mix of balm oil after havingpronounced the Conjuration of the Four to divert the influence of the elementaryspirits. After seven days, one must burn the figure in a consecrated fire, andyou can be sure that the statuette made by the enchanter will lose all itsvirtue at the same moment.We have already spoken of the sympathetic medicine of Paracelsus, which treatedthe members of wax and operated on blood from wounds to cure those wounds. Thissystem allowed him to employ the most violent remedies; he also had as hisprincipal specifics sublimate and vitriol.456 [9781101992746_EPUB-46__4.xhtml]We believe that homeopathy is a reminiscence of Paracelsus’s theories and areturn to learned practices. But we shall come back to this subject in a specialtreatise which will be exclusively dedicated to occult medicine.The resolutions of parents which commit the future of their children areenchantments which we can never condemn too much: children devoted to thewhite,457 [9781101992746_EPUB-46__5.xhtml] for example, almost never prosper;those who were devoted in the past to celibacy often fell into debauch, orturned to despair and to folly. It is never permitted for a man to do violenceto destiny, even less so to impose constraints on the legitimate use of liberty.We add here, as a supplement and an appendix to this chapter, a few words aboutmandrakes and androids,458 [9781101992746_EPUB-46__6.xhtml] which several magesconfuse with wax figurines which serve in the practice of enchantments.The natural mandrake is a hairy root which looks more or less, in its ensemble,like the figure of a man or like the male generative parts. This root is mildlynarcotic, and the ancients attributed an aphrodisiac virtue to it which made itdesired by the witches of Thessaly for the composition of potions.Is this root, as is supposed by a certain magical mysticism, the umbilicalvestige of our terrestrial origins? This is not something we would seriouslydare to affirm. It is certain, however, that man came from the alluvium of theEarth: he thus must have been formed as a first beginning in the form of a root.The analogies of nature absolutely require that we accept this idea, or at leastthe possibility of it. The first men could thus have been a family of giganticsensitive mandrakes that the Sun had animated, and who on their own detachedthemselves from the Earth, a belief which in no way excludes and even on thecontrary positively supposes the creative will and the providential cooperationof the first cause, which we have REASON to call GOD.A few ancient alchemists, struck by this idea, dreamed of a cultivation ofmandrakes, and looked to artificially reproduce a sludge which was fertileenough and a Sun active enough to humanize this root again and thus create menwithout the need for women.Others, who believed they saw in humanity the synthesis of animals, hopelesslytried to animate the mandrake, but they interbred by way of monstrous matings,and sowed human seed in animal earth, without producing anything except shamefulcrimes and monsters without descendants.The third manner of forming an android is with galvanized steel. They attributeto Albertus Magnus one of these almost intelligent automatons, and they add thatSaint Thomas broke it with a single blow of a stick, because he was annoyed byits responses. This tale is an allegory. Albertus Magnus’s android was theAristotelian theology of the primitive scholastic, which was broken by the Summaof Saint Thomas, that bold innovator who was the first to replace divinearbitrariness with the absolute law of reason by daring to formulate this axiom,which we do not fear to repeat here as often as we like, since it emanates froma great master: a thing is not just because God wills it; but God wills itbecause it is just.The real android, the serious android of the ancients, was a secret they hidfrom everyone and which Mesmer was the first to dare divulge in our time: it wasthe extension of the will of the mage in another body, organized and used by anelementary spirit; in other more modern and intelligible words, it was amagnetic subject."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIITHE WRITING OF THE STARSWe have finished with hell, and we breathe in deeply as we come back to thelight after having traversed the caverns of black magic.

Such is the last article of the symbol of theChristians,463 [9781101992746_EPUB-47_15.xhtml] and that article, all by itself,is an entire profession of faith.The ancients, in comparing the calm and peaceful immensity of the sky, peopledby immutable lights, to the agitations and the darkness of this world, believedthey had found in that beautiful book written in golden letters the final wordregarding the enigma of destiny; they traced, with their imaginations, the linesof correspondence between those brilliant lights of the divine writing, and theysay that the first constellations drawn by the shepherds of Chaldea were alsothe first characters of Cabalistic writing.These characters, first expressed by lines, then enclosed in hieroglyphicfigures, had, according to M. Moreau de Dammartin,464[9781101992746_EPUB-47_16.xhtml] author of a highly curious treatise on theorigin of the characters of the alphabet, determined the ancient mages’ choicesfor the figures of the Tarot, which this scholar recognizes as we do as anessentially hieratic and primordial book.Thus, in the opinion of this scholar, the Chinese Tseu, the Hebrew Aleph and theAlpha of the Greeks, expressed hieroglyphically through the figure of the Magus,were borrowed from the constellation of the crane, neighbor to the astralfish465 [9781101992746_EPUB-47_17.xhtml] of the Oriental sphere.The Chinese Tcheou, the Hebrew Beth and the Latin B, corresponding to thePriestess or to Junon, were formed from the head of the ram; the Chinese letterYin, the Hebrew Gimel and the Latin G, figured by the Empress, were borrowedfrom the constellation of the Great Bear, etc.The Cabalist Gaffarel, whom we have already cited more than once, erected aplanisphere where all the constellations formed the Hebrew letters; but we admitthat this configuration often seems to us as more than arbitrary, and that we donot understand why, on the indication of a single star, for example, Gaffareldraws a [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-1.jpg] rather than a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-2.jpg] or a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-3.jpg]; four stars equally suggest either a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-4.jpg], a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-5.jpg], or a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-6.jpg], rather than a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-7.jpg]. This is what turned us away fromproviding a copy of Gaffarel’s planisphere here, and his works are in any casenot very rare. This planisphere was reproduced in Father Montfaucon’s466[9781101992746_EPUB-47_18.xhtml] book on the religions and superstitions of theworld, and we also found a copy in the book on magic published by the mysticEckartshausen.467 [9781101992746_EPUB-47_19.xhtml]The scholars, incidentally, are not in agreement regarding the configuration ofthe letters of the primordial alphabet. The Italian Tarot, whose Gothic types itis a good idea to conserve, draws, through the disposition of its figures, fromthe Hebrew alphabet which was in use since the captivity, and which we call theAssyrian alphabet; but there exist fragments from other older Tarots where thedisposition is not the same. Since one should not guess haphazardly regardingerudite matters, we will wait, to fix our judgment, for new and more conclusivediscoveries.In regard to the alphabet of the stars, we believe that it is a subjectivechoice, just like the configuration of clouds, which seem to take on all thekinds of forms that our imagination lends them. This is as much the case forgroups of stars as for the points in geomancy468[9781101992746_EPUB-47__1.xhtml] and the drawing of cards in modern cartomancy.It is a pretext for magnetizing oneself and an instrument which can fix anddetermine natural intuition. Thus a Cabalist familiar with mystic hieroglyphswill see things in the stars which would not be discovered by a simple shepherd;but the shepherd, from his viewpoint, will find combinations which would escapethe Cabalist. The people of the countryside see a rake in the belt and sword ofOrion; a Hebrew Cabalist sees in that same Orion, considered in its entirety,all the mysteries of Ezekiel, the ten sephiroth disposed in ternary form, acentral triangle formed of four stars and then a line of three forming the yod,and the two figures together expressing all the mysteries of the Bereshith, thenfour stars forming the wheels of Merkabah and completing the divine chariot. Bylooking at it in another manner and by placing other ideal lines, he will see a[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-8.jpg], gimel, perfectly formed and placedabove a [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-9.jpg], yod, in a large[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-10.jpg], daleth, upturned; a figure whichrepresents the fight between good and evil, with the definitive triumph of good.In effect, the [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-11.jpg], founded on the yod,is the ternary produced by the unitary, it is the manifestation of the divineVerb, while the upturned daleth is the ternary composed by the evil binarymultiplied by itself. The figure of Orion, considered thus, would be identicalto the angel Michael battling against the dragon, and the apparition of thissign, presented in this form, would, for the Cabalist, presage victory andhappiness.[image/Doctrine_Magic_26.jpg]A long contemplation of the sky exalts the imagination; the stars then respondto our thoughts. The lines traced mentally from one to another star by the firstpeople to contemplate them must have given man his first ideas of geometry.Depending on whether our soul is agitated or calm, the stars seem to be glaringwith threats or scintillating with hopes. The sky is thus the mirror of thehuman soul, and when we believe ourselves to be reading in the stars, it isourselves that we are reading.Gaffarel, when applying the predictions of celestial writing to the destiny ofempires, says that the ancients did not draw all the signs of evil omens in thenorthern part of the sky in vain, and that for all time, calamities wereregarded as having come from the north to spread over the earth by invading thesouth.“It is for this reason,” says he, “that the ancients figured on these northernparts of the sky a serpent or a dragon right beside the bears, because theseanimals are the true hieroglyphs of tyranny, of pillage and all type ofoppression. And in fact, go through the annals, and you will see that all thegreat devastations which ever occurred came from the north. The Assyrians orChaldeans, animated by Nebuchadnezzar and Shalmaneser, had often shown the truthof this with the burning of a temple and a city, the most sumptuous and the mostholy in the universe, and with the complete ruin of a people who God himself hadprovided with his singular protection, and for whom he said he was theirparticular father. And that other Jerusalem, the good Rome, had she not alsooften been tested by the furies of that wicked northern race, when, by thecruelties of Alaric, Genseric, Attila, and the rest of the Gothic princes, Huns,Vandals, and Alans, she saw her altars upturned and the summits of her superbedifices razed to the ground. . . . Very well, then, in the secrets of thiscelestial writing, we read on the northern side evil and misfortune, since aseptentrione pandetur omne malum.469 [9781101992746_EPUB-47__2.xhtml] Yet theVerb [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-12.jpg], which we translate bypandetur, also means depingetur or scribetur,470[9781101992746_EPUB-47__3.xhtml] and the prophecy also means: all the evils ofthe world are written in the northern part of the sky.”We transcribed this entire passage from Gaffarel because it is not withoutresonance in our time, where the north seems to menace Europe again;471[9781101992746_EPUB-47__4.xhtml] but it is also the destiny of cold fogs to bevanquished by the Sun, and the darkness must dissipate on its own when itarrives in the light. There for us is the last word of prophecy and the secretof the future.Gaffarel also adds a few other predictions drawn from the stars, that forexample of the gradual weakening of the Ottoman Empire—but, as we have alreadysaid, the figures of these constellated letters are relatively arbitrary. Hedeclares, for the rest, to have borrowed these predictions from a HebrewCabalist called Rabbi Chomer, which he does not flatter himself by claiming tounderstand well.Here is the table of magical characters which were drawn by the ancientastrologists following the zodiacal constellations; each of these charactersrepresents the name of a good or bad spirit. We know that the signs of theZodiac deal with diverse celestial influences and in consequence express anannual alternation between good and evil.[image/Doctrine_Magic_27.jpg]THE NAMES OF THE SPIRITS DESIGNATED BY THESE CHARACTERS ARE:For Aries, SATAARAN and Sarahiel;For Taurus, BAGDAL and Araziel;For Gemini, SAGRAS and Saraiel;For Cancer, RAHDAR and Phakiel;For Leo, SAGHAM and Seratiel;For Virgo, IADARA and Schaltiel;For Libra, GRASGARBEN and Hadakiel;For Scorpio, RIEHOL and Saissaiel;For Sagittarius, VHNORI and Saritaiel;For Capricorn, SAGDALON and Semakiel;For Aquarius, ARCHER and Ssakmakiel;For Pisces, RASAMASA and Vacabiel.The sage who wishes to read the sky must also observe the days of the Moon,whose influence is very great in astrology. The Moon by turns attracts andrepels the magnetic fluid of the Earth, and it is thus that is produced the fluxand reflux of the sea: one must therefore know the phases well and know how todiscern the days and the hours. The new moon is favorable for beginning allmagical works: from the first quarter to the full moon, its influence is hot;from the full moon to the last quarter, its influence is dry; from the lastquarter until the end, its influence is cold.Here now are the special characters for all the days of the Moon, marked by thetwenty-two keys of the Tarot and with the signs of the seven planets:472[9781101992746_EPUB-47__5.xhtml] 1. The Magician or Magus. The first day of the Moon is that of the creation of the Moon itself. This day is consecrated to initiatives of the spirit and should be favorable for good innovations. 1. The Priestess, or occult science. The second day, whose spirit is Enediel, was the fifth day of creation, since the Moon was made on the fourth day. The birds and the fish, which were created on this day, are the living hieroglyphs of the magical analogies and of the universal doctrine of Hermes. Water and air, which were then filled with the forms of the Verb, are the elementary figures of the Mercury of the sages, that is to say intelligence and speech. This day is favorable for revelations, initiations, and great scientific discoveries. 1. The celestial mother or the Empress. The third day was that of the creation of man. Also, the Moon, in the Cabala, is called MOTHER, when we represent it accompanied with the number three. This day is favorable for generation and more generally for all types of production, either of the body or the spirit. 1. The Emperor, or the dominator. The fourth day is ill-fated: it was that of the birth of Cain; but it is favorable for unjust and tyrannical undertakings. 1. The Pope, or the Hierophant. The fifth day is fortunate: it was the day of Abel’s birth. 1. The Lovers, or liberty. The sixth day is the day of pride: it was the day of Lamech’s birth, the one who said to women: I killed a man who had hit me and a young man who had hurt me. Cursed is he who would attempt to punish me! This day is favorable for conspiracies and revolts. 1. The Chariot. On the seventh day, birth of Hebron, he who gave his name to the first of the holy cities of Israel. Day of religion, of prayers, and of success. 1. Justice. The murder of Abel. Day of expiation. 1. The old man or the Hermit. The birth of Methuselah. Day of benediction for children. 1. Ezekiel’s wheel of fortune. The birth of Nebuchadnezzar. Reign of the beast. Ill-fated day. 1. Strength. The birth of Noah. The visions on this day will be misleading, but it is a day of good health and longevity for children born on it. 1. The sacrificed, or the Hanged Man. The birth of Samuel. Prophetic and Cabalistic day, favorable for the accomplishment of the Great Work. 1. Death. The day of the birth of Canaan, the cursed son of Ham. Ill-fated day and fatal number. 1. The angel of Temperance. The benediction of Noah, the fourteenth day of the Moon. This day is presided over by the angel Cassiel from Uriel’s hierarchy. 1. Typhon or the Devil. Birth of Ishmael, day of condemnation and exile. 1. The stricken tower. The day of the birth of Jacob and Esau and of Jacob’s predestination as the ruin of Esau. 1. The sparkling Star. The fire of heaven burns Sodom and Gomorrah. Day of salvation for the good and ruin for the wicked, dangerous if it falls on a Saturday. It is under the reign of Scorpio. 1. The Moon. Birth of Isaac, triumph of the wife. Day of conjugal affection and good hope. 1. The Sun. Birth of Pharaoh. Lucky or fatal day for the greatness of the world, depending on the differing merits of great men. 1. Judgment. Birth of Jonah, the organ of God’s judgments. Favorable day for divine revelations. 1. The World. Birth of Saul, material royalty. Danger for the mind and reason. 1. Influence of Saturn. Birth of Job. Day of trials and suffering. 1. Influence of Venus. Birth of Benjamin. Day of fondness and of tenderness. 1. Influence of Jupiter. Birth of Japheth. 1. Influence of Mercury. Tenth Egyptian plague. 1. Influence of Mars. Deliverance of the Israelites and the crossing of the Red Sea. 1. Influence of Diana or of Hecate. The resounding victory of Judas Maccabeus. 1. Influence of the Sun. Samson carries off the Gates of Gaza. Day of strength and of deliverance. 1. The Tarot Fool. Day of abrogation and lack of success in all things.With this rabbinical table, which Jean Belot and others borrowed from the HebrewCabalists, we can see that the ancient masters had concluded a posteriori thatthings had probable influences, which is completely within the logic of theoccult sciences. We also see how much the diverse significations are enclosed inthe twenty keys which form the alphabet of the Tarot, and the truth of ourassertions, when we claim that all the secrets of the Cabala and of magic, allthe mysteries of the ancient world, all the science of the patriarchs, all thehistorical traditions from primordial times, are enclosed in this hieroglyphicbook of Thoth, of Enoch, or of Cadmus.A very simple way of finding celestial horoscopes through onomancy473[9781101992746_EPUB-47__6.xhtml] is the one we will now describe; it reconcilesGaffarel with us and can provide very startlingly exact and profound results.During the day, take a black card in which you will cut out the letters of thename of the person for whom you are consulting; place this card at the end of atube which is thinned on the side facing the observer’s eye and larger at theside where the card is; then you will look alternatively at the four cardinalpoints, starting with the east and finishing with the north. You will take noteof all the stars you see through the letters, then you convert the letters ofthe name into numbers and with the sum of their addition cut out in the samemanner, you renew the operation; you will count how many stars you have; then,adding this number to that of the number of the name, you will add again and youwill cut out the total of the two numbers in Hebrew characters. You will thenrenew the operation, and you take note of the stars which you had encountered;then you will look up in a celestial planisphere the names of all the stars; youwill make a classification according to their size and brilliance; you willchoose the largest and most brilliant as the polar star of your astrologicaloperation; you will then consult an Egyptian planisphere (a relatively completeand well-engraved one is found in the atlas of the large work by Dupuis), andyou look for the names and the figures of the spirits who belong to those stars.You will then know which signs are lucky or unlucky that enter into the name ofthe person and what their influence will be, either in childhood (that is thename traced in the east), or during their youth (that is the name of the south),or in adulthood (that is the name of the west), or in old age (that is the nameof the north), or finally during an entire life (that is the stars which willenter into the whole number formed by the addition of the letters and thestars). This astrological operation is simple, easy, and requires littlecalculation; it is brought to us from the oldest antiquity and obviouslybelongs, as we can be convinced by studying the works of Gaffarel and his masterRabbi Chomer, to the primordial magic of the ancients.This onomantic astrology was the one used by all the ancient Hebrew Cabalists,as is proven by their observations, which were conserved by Rabbi Chomer, RabbiKapol, Rabbi Abujan474 [9781101992746_EPUB-47__7.xhtml] and other masters of theCabala. The threats the prophets made to various empires of the world werefounded on the characters of the stars that they found vertically above them inthe regular relationship of the celestial sphere with the terrestrial sphere. Itis thus that in the writing in the sky itself we see the name of Greece inHebrew, [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-13.jpg] or[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-14.jpg], and in translating it into numbersthey found the word [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-15.jpg], which signifiesruined, desolate.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-16.jpg]2 2 8Charab = Destroyed, DesolateSum: 12[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-17.jpg]5 6 4Yavan = GreeceSum: 12They conclude from this that after a cycle of twelve periods, Greece will bedesolate and ruined.475 [9781101992746_EPUB-47__8.xhtml]A little before the fire and the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem byNebuzaradan, the Cabalists noted vertically above the temple eleven starsdisposed like this:******** * * * and which all enter into the word [image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-18.jpg],written from the north to the occident as: Hibshich, which means reprobation andabandonment without mercy. The sum of the numbers of the letters is 423, exactlythe time the temple lasted.The empires of Persia and Assyria were threatened with destruction by the fourvertical stars which entered in the three letters[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-19.jpg], Rob, and the fatal number indicatedby the letters was 208 years.Four stars also announced to the Cabalist rabbis of that time the fall anddivision of Alexander’s empire, by arranging themselves in the word[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-20.jpg], parad, to divide, whose number,284, indicates the entire duration of that kingdom, either for its root or forits branches.According to Rabbi Chomer, the destinies of the Ottoman power in Constantinoplewere fixed in advance and announced by four stars, which, arranged in the word[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-21.jpg], caah, signify to be weak, sick, tobe close to one’s end. The stars which, in the letter[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-22.jpg], were brighter, indicate a large[image/9781101992746_EPUB-47_vector-23.jpg] and give the value 1,000 to thisletter. The three letters together make 1,025, which one must start countingsince Constantinople was taken by Mehmed II, a calculation which promises a fewmore centuries of existence to the weak empire of the sultans, now supported byall of Europe.476 [9781101992746_EPUB-47__9.xhtml]The “MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN” that Belshazzar, in his drunkenness, saw written onthe wall of his palace by the rays of the torches, was an onomantic intuitionlike that of the rabbis.477 [9781101992746_EPUB-47_10.xhtml] Belshazzar, nodoubt initiated by the Hebrew seers in the reading of the stars, operatedinstinctively and without thinking on the lamps of his nocturnal celebration ashe could have done with the stars in the sky. The three words which he hadformed in his imagination would soon become indelible in his eyes and make allthe lights of his celebration pale. It was not difficult to predict a fatesimilar to that of Sardanapalus478 [9781101992746_EPUB-47_12.xhtml] for a kingwho, in a besieged city, abandoned himself to orgies. We have said, and werepeat as a conclusion to this chapter; that magnetic intuitions are alone whatgive value and reality to all these Cabalistic and astrological calculations,they are perhaps puerile and completely arbitrary if done without inspiration,through cold curiosity and without a powerful will."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIIIPOTIONS AND MAGNETISMLet us now travel to Thessaly, the country of enchantments. It is here thatApuleius was fooled like Ulysses’s companions and was subjected to a shamefultransformation. Here everything is magic, from the birds that fly and theinsects that buzz in the grass to the trees and the flowers; here, under thelight of the Moon, the poisons which make one fall in love are composed; herethe stryges invent charms which render one young and beautiful like Charites.Young men, beware.In effect, the art of poisoning reason or of potions seem, according to thetraditions, to have developed their venomous efflorescence more in Thessaly thananywhere else; but here again magnetism played the most important role, becauseexcitatory or narcotic plants, cursed and unhealthy animal substances, take alltheir power from enchantments, that is to say the sacrifices accomplished bywitches and the words they pronounced while preparing their potions and drinks.Stimulating substances and those which contain more phosphorus479[9781101992746_EPUB-48_fn.xhtml] are natural aphrodisiacs. All that actsintensely upon the nervous system can cause passionate overexcitement, and if aclever and persevering will knows how to direct and influence these naturaldispositions, she will make use of the passions of others for the benefit of herown, and soon reduce the proudest of persons into becoming, within a given time,the instruments of her pleasures.It is through a similar influence that one can protect oneself, and it is toprovide weapons for the weak that we write this chapter.First, here are the practices of the enemy:He who wishes to make someone fall in love with him (we only attribute suchillegitimate maneuvers to a man, on the assumption that a woman never has theneed to do so), he, then, who wishes to make someone love him must first havehimself be noticed and produce some kind of impression upon the imagination ofthe person he desires. He should strike her with admiration, surprise, orterror, or even horror if that is his only resource; but he must at all costrise above the rank of common men for her and take, by will or by force, a placein her memories, in her apprehensions, and in her dreams. A Lovelace iscertainly not the avowed ideal of the Clarissas of this world,480[9781101992746_EPUB-48__4.xhtml] but they think unceasingly about censuringthem, cursing them, feeling sorry for their victims, desiring their conversionand their repentance, and then they wish for them to be regenerated throughdevotion and pardon; and then a secret vanity tells them that it would be niceto attract the love of a Lovelace, to love him and to resist him. And there youhave Clarissa, who surprises herself by loving a Lovelace; she blames herselffor her love, she blushes, she renounces her love a thousand times, only to lovea thousand times more; and then, when the supreme moment arrives, she forgets toresist him.If angels were also women, as they are represented in modern mysticism, thenJehovah acted as a wise and prudent father when he kicked Satan out the gates ofheaven.It is a great disappointment for the self-esteem of certain honest women to finda man who is good and irreproachable at heart, but with whom they had becomebesotted by taking him for a rascal. The angel then scornfully leaves him whilesaying to him: You are not the devil!Make yourself up then, as perfectly as possible as the devil, you who wish toseduce an angel.Nothing is permitted to a virtuous man. Who does he think he is? say the women;does he think we are less moral than he is? But they forgive a rascaleverything, saying, “What more can you expect from such a being?”The role of a man of great principles and of rigid character can only have powerover women whom we never have any need to seduce; all the others withoutexception adore the bad guys.It is the complete contrary with men, and it is this contrast which makesmodesty the preserve of women: it is for them the first and most natural ofcoquetries.One of the most distinguished, most kind and scholarly doctors of London, Dr.Ashburner,481 [9781101992746_EPUB-48__5.xhtml] was telling me, last year, thatone of his clients, as they were leaving the house of a grand lady one day, saidto him: “I have just received the strangest of compliments. The marquise of ***told me while looking me in the eye: ‘Sir, you will not make me lower my headbefore your terrible gaze; you have the eyes of Satan.’” “Well well!” the doctorresponded to him with a smile, “You no doubt threw yourself at her neck andkissed her?” “But no: I stood there surprised by this sudden rude remark.”“Well! my dear friend, do not return to her house; you must certainly be lost toher heart now.”We say that quite commonly the office of the hangman is handed down from fatherto son. Hangmen have sons, then? No doubt, since they never lack for women.Marat had a mistress who loved him tenderly, he, the horrible leper; but he wasalso the terrible Marat, who made everyone tremble.We could say that love, especially for women, is a veritable hallucination. Forlack of some other senseless motive, love often is determined by the absurd. Tocheat on Gioconda482 [9781101992746_EPUB-48__6.xhtml] in favor of a moneybags,the horror! Well! if it is such a horror, why not do it? It must be so agreeablefrom time to time to commit a little horror.Given this transcendental knowledge of women, there is a second maneuver one canoperate to attract her attention: this is to ignore her, or only to payattention to her in a manner which humiliates her self-esteem, by treating herlike a child and by throwing the idea of ever courting her very far away. Thenthe roles will change: she will do anything to tempt you, she will initiate youinto the secrets which women keep, she will dress and undress before you whiletelling you things like this: “Between women,” “between old friends,” “I do notfear you,” “you are not the man for me,” and so on and so forth. Then she willobserve your demeanor, and if she finds it calm, indifferent, she will bebesides herself; she will approach you on any pretext, graze you with her hair,let her robe part slightly. . . . We have even seen them, in similarcircumstances, putting themselves at risk of an assault, not through tenderness,but out of curiosity, impatience, and because they are all worked up.A magician who has spirit needs no other love potions than these; he alsodisposes of flattering words, magnetic breath, a light but voluptuous touch,along with a sort of hypocrisy, as though he had not planned it. The users oflove potions must be old, stupid, ugly, impotent; so what good is a potion? Anyman who is truly a man always has at his disposition the means to make himselfloved, as long as he is not trying to occupy a place that is already taken. Itwould be supremely maladroit to attempt a conquest with a young married womanduring the sweetness of her honeymoon or a strengthened Clarissa who already hasher Lovelace, who renders her unhappy or whose love she bitterly reproaches.We will not speak here about the dirty tricks of black magic regarding potions;we have finished with the kitchens of Canidia. We can see in the Epodes ofHorace how this abominable Roman witch composed poisons, and we can, regardingthe sacrifices and enchantments of love, reread the Eclogues of Theocritus andof Virgil,483 [9781101992746_EPUB-48__7.xhtml] where ceremonies of this sort ofmagical work are described in detail. We will not transcribe here the recipes ofeither the grimoires or of the Petit Albert, which everyone can consult. All ofthe different practices have to do with magnetism or poisonous magic and areeither naive or criminal. The drinks which weaken the spirit and trouble reasoncan assure the already conquered empire of a wicked will, and it is thus thatthe Empress Caesonia fixed, they say, the ferocious love of Caligula. This iswhy one must avoid all distillations which taste of almonds, and keep away fromthe bedroom cherry laurel and datura, almond soaps, almond milks, and in generalall perfume compositions where the odor of almonds dominates, especially if itseffect on the brain is seconded by amber.To reduce the action of intelligence is to augment in equal proportion theopposing forces of mad passion. Love of the type which evildoers wish toinspire, and of which we speak here, is a veritable stultification and the mostshameful of all types of moral servitude. The more we annoy a slave, the more werender him incapable of liberating himself, that is the true secret ofApuleius’s sorceress and the drinks of Circe.The use of tobacco, either sniffed or smoked, is a dangerous auxiliary tostupefying potions and poisonings of reason. Nicotine, as we know, is no lessviolent a poison than prussic acid, and this acid is found in greater quantityin tobacco than in almonds.484 [9781101992746_EPUB-48__8.xhtml]The absorption of a will by another often changes a whole series of destinies,and it is not only for our own sakes that we should watch over our relations andlearn to discern between pure and impure atmospheres: because true potions, themost dangerous potions, are invisible; they are currents of the radiating vitallight which, by mixing and exchanging with each other, produce attractions andsympathies, for which magnetic experiments leave no room to doubt.The history of the Church speaks of a heresiarch named Marcus,485[9781101992746_EPUB-48__9.xhtml] who rendered all the women mad for him byblowing on them; but his power was destroyed by a courageous Christian woman whoblew on him first, while saying to him: May God be your judge!The priest Gaufridi, who was burned as a sorcerer, claimed to make any woman whowas touched by his breath fall in love with him.The all too famous Father Girard, Jesuit, was accused by the damsel Cadière, herconfessor, of having made her totally lose her judgment by blowing on her. Shewell needed that excuse to attenuate the horror and ridicule of her accusationsagainst this father, whose culpability has otherwise never been proven but who,for good or evil, had certainly inspired a shameful passion in that miserablegirl.“Mlle Ranfaing, having become a widow in 16——,” says Dom Calmet486[9781101992746_EPUB-48_10.xhtml] in his Treatise on Apparitions, “was courted bya doctor called Poirot. Having been rejected by her, he then gave her potions tomake himself loved, which caused strange disturbances in Mlle Ranfaing’s health.Soon such extraordinary things happened to this lady, that it was believed thatshe was possessed, and the doctors declared that they could not understandanything regarding her state, and recommended her to the exorcisms of theChurch.“After which, by order of M. de Porcelets, bishop of Toul, they sent her to theexorcist M. Viardin, doctor in theology and state councilor to the Duke ofLorraine, a Jesuit and a Capuchin; but during the course of this exorcism,almost all the clergymen in Nancy, the above-mentioned lord bishop, the bishopof Tripoli, suffragan of Strasbourg, M. de Sancy, ambassador for the veryChristian king in Constantinople and at that time the priest of the Oratory,Charles de Lorraine, bishop of Verdun, two doctors from the Sorbonne sentexpressly to assist in the exorcism often exorcised her in Hebrew, Greek, and inLatin, to which she always responded pertinently, she who could barely readLatin.“We refer to the certificate provided by Nicolas de Harley, very skilled in theHebrew language, who recognizes that Mlle Ranfaing was truly possessed andresponded to him only through the movement of his lips, without him actuallypronouncing any words, and that she provided him with several proofs ofpossession. Sir Garnier, doctor of the Sorbonne, also having given her severalcommands in the Hebrew language, claims she responded to him in a pertinentmanner, but in French, saying that the agreement was that he speak only inordinary language. The demon then added: ‘Is it not enough that I show you thatI hear what you say?’ This same Garnier, speaking to her in Greek, replaced onecase by another due to inattention. The possessed, or rather the devil, tellshim: ‘You have failed.’ The doctor tells her in Greek: ‘Show me my failure.’ Thedevil responds: ‘Content yourself with the fact that I point out your fault; Iwill not tell you more.’ The doctor having told her to be quiet in Greek, sheresponds to him with: ‘You command me to be quiet, and I do not wish to shutup.’”This remarkable example of hysterical illness brought right up to ecstasy anddemonomania after the administration of a potion by a man who thought of himselfas a sorcerer, shows better than anything we could say the action of theomnipotence of the will and the imagination on one person and another, and thestrange lucidity of ecstatics or hypnotics, who understand speech by readingthoughts without having knowledge of the words. I do not in any way doubt thesincerity of the witnesses named by Calmet; I am merely surprised that suchserious men had not remarked upon the difficulty this so-called demon had inresponding to them in a language unknown to the patient. If their interlocutorwas indeed what they meant by a demon, she would not only have understood Greek,but she would have also spoken Greek: it would not have been any more difficultto do one as the other for such a scholarly and clever spirit.Dom Calmet does not stop there with the story of Mlle Ranfaing; he recounts awhole series of insidious questions and not very serious injunctions on the partof the exorcists, and a series or responses which are more or less incongruousfrom the poor patient, still ecstatic and hypnotized. This good father does notneglect to refer to the luminous conclusions of the equally good Count deMirville. That which occurred having been above the intelligences of thewitnesses, they must conclude that all of it was the works of hell. What abeautiful and scholarly conclusion! The more serious aspect of the whole affairis that the doctor, Poirot, was put on trial as a magician, inevitably confessedunder torture, and was burned. If he had really, with whatever potion, attackedthe reason of that woman, he would have merited being tried as a poisoner: thisis all that we can say about it.But the most terrible potions are the mystic exaltations of ill-intentioneddevotion. What impurities could ever equal the nightmares of Saint Anthony andthe torments of Saint Teresa and of Saint Angela of Foligno?487[9781101992746_EPUB-48_11.xhtml] This last person applied a red hot iron to herrebellious flesh and found that the material fire was a coolant for her hiddenardors. With what violence does nature need to be treated when we refuse it bycontinually thinking that we detest it! It is through mysticism that began theso-called bewitchment of Madeleine Bavent, of Mlle de la Palud, and MlleCadière.488 [9781101992746_EPUB-48__1.xhtml] The excessive fear of a thingrenders it almost always inevitable. In following the two curves of a circle,one arrives and one meets at the same point. Nicolas Remigius,489[9781101992746_EPUB-48__2.xhtml] a criminal judge in Lorraine, who had eighthundred women burned alive as witches, saw magic everywhere: it was his idéefixe, his madness. He wanted to preach for a crusade against sorcerers, withwhich he believed Europe was full; in desperation for not being believed on hisword when he claimed that almost everyone was guilty of magic, he ended updeclaring that he himself was a sorcerer and was burnt at the stake by his ownconfession.To protect oneself from negative influences, the first condition is to not allowone’s imagination to become enthused. All fanatics are more or less mad, and onedominates a madman by taking him by his folly. Place yourself, then, abovepuerile fears and vague desires; believe in supreme wisdom; be convinced thatthis wisdom, having given you intelligence as the unique means of knowing,cannot wish to set traps for your intelligence and your reason. You see allaround you effects proportionate to their causes, you see causes which aredirected and modified in man’s domain by intelligence; in summary, you see goodas being stronger and more esteemed than evil: why would you suppose an immenseunreason within the infinite, since there is reason in the finite? The truthhides from no one. God is visible through his works, and he demands nothing ofhis creatures which is against their nature, of whom he is their author. Faithis confidence; have confidence, not in men who speak badly of reason, becausethey are madmen and impostors, but in the eternal reason which is the divineVerb, that veritable light offered like the sun to the intuitions of all humancreatures of this world.If you believe in absolute reason and if you desire more than anything elsetruth and justice, you need not fear anyone, and you will love only those whoare kind. Your natural light will instinctively repulse the wicked, because theywill be dominated by your will. Thus even venomous substances which could beadministered to you will not affect your intelligence. They might render yousick, but they will never make you a criminal.What mostly contributes to rendering women irrational is the flaccid andhypocritical education they are given. If they did more mental work, if theywere taught about the world in a more frank and liberal manner, they would beless capricious, less vain, less futile, and in consequence less accessible toevil seductions. Weakness always sympathizes with vice, because vice is aweakness which only gives the appearance of being powerful. Folly is horrifiedby reason and takes pleasure in all that is exaggeration and lies. Heal firstthe intelligence of the sick person. The cause of all enchantments, the venom inall potions, the power of all sorcerers is found there.As to narcotics or other poisons which may have been administered to you, thatis a matter for medicine and the law; but we do not think that such enormitiesoccur very often in our day. The Lovelaces need not lull the Clarissas to sleepby any means except their gallantries and alcoholic drinks. Like abductions bymasked men and captivities in caves, which are no longer appropriate even in ourmodern novels, one must relegate all the rest to the confessionals of darkpenitents or to the ruins of the Castle of Udolpho.490[9781101992746_EPUB-48__3.xhtml]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIXTHE MAGISTERY OF THE SUNWe arrive at the number which in the Tarot is marked by the Sun. The denary ofPythagoras and the ternary multiplied by itself represent wisdom applied to theabsolute. It is thus of the absolute which we will speak about here.To find the absolute in the infinite, in the indefinite, and in the finite—suchis the Great Work of the sages and what Hermes called the work of the Sun.To find the unwavering foundations of the true religious faith in philosophicaltruth and metallic transmutation is Hermes’s entire secret; it is thephilosopher’s stone.This stone is one and many; it is decomposed through analysis and recomposedthrough synthesis. Through analysis, it is a powder, the powder of projection ofthe alchemists; before analysis and after synthesis, it is a stone.The philosopher’s stone, say the masters, should not be exposed to air or thegaze of the profane; one must always keep it hidden and conserve it with care,in the most secret place in one’s laboratory, and always keep on one’s personthe key to the place where it is contained.He who possesses the Grand Arcanum is a veritable king and more than a king,because he is inaccessible to all fears and vain hopes. For all the maladies ofthe soul and the body, a single fragment from the precious stone, a single fleckof the divine powder are sufficient to cure them. “He who hath an ear, let himhear!” as the Master said.491 [9781101992746_EPUB-49_fn.xhtml]Salt, sulfur, and mercury are but accessory elements and passive instruments inthe Great Work. All depends, as we have said, on the internal magnes ofParacelsus. The work is entirely in the projection, and the projection isperfectly accomplished by an effective intelligence and realizable with a singleword.There is only one important operation in the work: it consists of sublimation,which is nothing other, according to Geber,492 [9781101992746_EPUB-49__1.xhtml]than the elevation of the thing which is dry through the means of fire, withadherence to its proper vessel.He who wishes to attain the understanding of the great word and the possessionof the Grand Arcanum must, after having meditated on the principles of ourdoctrine, carefully read the hermetic philosophers, and he will succeed inbecoming initiated as others have before him; but he must take as the key totheir allegories the unique doctrine of Hermes, contained in his Emerald Tablet,and follow, in order to classify the knowledge and direct the operation, theorder indicated in the Cabalistic alphabet of the Tarot, whose entire andabsolute explication we provide in the last chapter of this work.Among the rare and precious books which contain the mysteries of the GrandArcanum, one must count the Chemical Pathway, or Manual, by Paracelsus, whichcontains all the mysteries of demonstrative physics and of the most secretCabala. This precious and original manuscript is only found in the Vatican’slibrary. Sendivogius made a copy, which the Baron de Tschoudy used to composethe hermetic catechism contained in his work called The Flaming Star. Thiscatechism, which we indicate to wise Cabalists as being a working substitute forthe incomparable treatise by Paracelsus, contains all the true principles of theGreat Work in a manner which is so satisfying and clear that one must totallylack any special intelligence regarding occultism in order to be unable toarrive at the absolute truth by meditating upon it.Raymond Lully, one of the great, sublime masters of the science, has said thatto make gold one must first have some gold. Nothing can be made from nothing;one does not create wealth absolutely: one augments and multiplies. Thusaspirants of science well understand that one must not ask of the adept eithersleights of hand or miracles. The hermetic science, like all real sciences, ismathematically demonstrable. Its results, even material ones, are as rigorous asthose of a properly calculated equation.The hermetic gold is not just a true doctrine, a light without shadows, a truthwithout alloy or lies; it is also material gold, real, pure, and the mostprecious gold that could be found in the mines of the Earth.But living gold, living sulfur, or the true fire of the philosophers must besearched for in the house of mercury. This fire is fed by air; in order toexpress its attractive and expansive power, we cannot provide a bettercomparison than that of lightning, which is primarily a dry and terrestrialexhalation united with humid vapors, but which in exalting itself, coming intocontact with the igneous nature, acts on the humidity which is inherent to it,which it attracts to itself and transmutes into its nature, after which itprecipitates rapidly to the Earth, where it is attracted by a fixed naturesimilar to its own.493 [9781101992746_EPUB-49__2.xhtml]These words, enigmatic in form, but clear in content, clearly express what thephilosophers mean by their mercury which is fertilized by sulfur, which becomesthe master and the regenerator of salt: it is the AZOTH, the universal magnesia,the great magical agent, the astral light, the light of life, fertilized by thepower of the anima, by intellectual energy, which they compare to sulfur becauseof its affinities with the divine fire. As to salt, it is the absolute matter.All matter contains salt, and all salt can be converted to pure gold by thecombined action of sulfur and of mercury, which sometimes act so rapidly thatthe transmutation can be done in an instant, in an hour, without tiring theoperator and almost without cost; other times, due to more difficultcircumstances and atmospheric conditions, the operation requires several days,several months, and sometimes even several years.As we have already said, there exists in nature two primary and essential lawswhich produce things by counterbalancing between each other to create theuniversal equilibrium: they are fixity and movement, analogous, in philosophy,to truth and invention, and, in absolute thought, to necessity and liberty,which are the very essence of God. The Hermetic philosophers give the word fixedto all that has weight, to everything which tends by its nature to restcentrally and be immobile; they call the volatile all which most naturally andvoluntarily obeys the law of movement, and they form the stone of analysis, thatis to say the volatilization of the fixed, and then of synthesis, that is to saythe fixation of the volatile, that which they operate and apply to the fixed,which they call their salt, sulfurized mercury or the light of life directed andrendered all-powerful by a secret operation. They thus take possession of all ofnature and their stone is found everywhere that there is salt, which means thatno substance is foreign to the Great Work and that we can change to gold evenwhat appears to be the most despicable and vile matter, which is true in thesense that, as we have said, they all contain the principiant salt, representedin our symbols by the cubic stone itself, as we can see in the symbolic anduniversal frontispiece of the keys of Basilius Valentinus.To know how to extract the pure salt hidden in all matter is to possess thesecret of the stone. This stone is thus a saline stone which the od or theuniversal astral light decomposes or recomposes; it is unique and multiple,because it can be dissolved like ordinary salt and be incorporated in othersubstances. Obtained through analysis, one could call it the universalsublimation; found through synthesis, it is the veritable panacea of theancients, because it cures all maladies, either of the soul or of the body, andwas called the medicine par excellence of all of nature. When, throughinitiation, one disposes of the absolute forces of the universal agent, onealways has this stone at one’s disposition because the extraction of the stoneis then a simple and easy operation very distinct from projection or metallicrealizations. This stone, in its sublimated state, should not be left in contactwith the air of the atmosphere, which can partially dissolve it and make it loseits virtue. It is without danger, incidentally, to inhale its emanations. Thesage prefers to keep it within its natural envelopes, in the knowledge that hecan extract it in a single effort of his will and with a single application ofthe universal agent to its envelopes, which the Cabalists call husks. It is inorder to express this law of prudence hieroglyphically that they gave theirmercury, personified in Egypt by Hermanubis, the head of a dog, and to theirsulfur, represented by the Baphomet of the Temple, or the prince of the Sabbath,that goat head which made the occult associations of the Middle Ages sodecried.494 [9781101992746_EPUB-49__3.xhtml]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXTHAUMATURGYWe have defined miracles as the natural effects of exceptional causes.495[9781101992746_EPUB-50_fn.xhtml]The immediate action of the human will on the body, or at least that action asexercised without visible means, constitutes a miracle in the physical realm.The influence exercised upon wills or upon intelligences, either suddenly or ina given time, and capable of captivating thought, of changing the most fixedresolutions, of paralyzing the most violent passions, this influence constitutesa miracle in the moral realm.The common error, with regard to miracles, is to see them as effects withoutcauses, contradictions to nature, sudden fictions of the divine imagination; andwe concede that a single miracle of this type would break the universal harmonyand plunge us into a universe in chaos.There are miracles that are impossible for God himself: they are absurdmiracles. If God could be absurd even for an instant, neither he nor the worldwould exist the instant afterward. To expect of divine arbitrariness an effectwhose cause we ignore or whose cause does not even exist is what is termedtempting God; it is to leap into the abyss.God acts through his works: in heaven he operates through the angels, and onEarth through men. Thus in the circle of action of angels, angels can do allwhich is possible for God to do; and in the circle of action of men, men alsodispose of the divine omnipotence.In the heaven of human conceptions, it is humanity who created God, and menthink that God made them in his image because they make him in his.The domain of man is all of corporeal and visible nature on Earth, and though hedoes not regulate the great celestial bodies and the stars, he can at leastcalculate their movements and measure the distance and identify his will bytheir influence; he can modify the atmosphere, act up to a certain point uponthe seasons, cure and sicken his fellow men, preserve life and deal out death,and by preservation of life we even mean, as we have said, resurrection incertain cases.The absolute in reason and in will is the greatest power which is given to manto attain, and it is through the means of this power with which he performsthose things that the multitudes admire under the name of miracles.The most perfect purity of intention is indispensable to the thaumaturge, andthen he requires a favorable current and unlimited confidence.The man who has managed to covet nothing and fear nothing is the master ofeverything. This is what is expressed by that beautiful allegory in the Gospelswhere we see the Son of God, thrice victorious over the impure spirit, beingserved in the desert by the angels.496 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__5.xhtml]Nothing on earth can resist a reasonable and free will. When the sage says: Iwill, it is God himself who will, and all that he commands is accomplished.It is the science and the confidence of the doctor which makes for the virtue ofhis remedies, and there exists no medicine more efficient and real thanthaumaturgy.But occult therapy is apart from all common medications. It uses most of allwords, insufflations, and communicates by means of the will a varied virtue tothe most simple substances: water, oil, wine, camphor, salt. The water of thehomeopaths is truly a magnetized and enchanted water, which operates throughfaith.497 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__6.xhtml] The energetic substances which theyadd in infinitesimal quantities are, in a manner of speaking, consecrations andare like the signs of the will of the doctor.That which is commonly called charlatanism is a great means of real success inmedicine if that charlatanism is skillful enough to inspire great confidence andform a circle of faith. In medicine most of all, it is faith which saves.There is hardly a village which does not have its practitioner of occultmedicine, and those people have almost everywhere an incomparably greatersuccess than those doctors approved by some university. The remedies which theyprescribe are often ridiculous or bizarre, and for that reason succeed all themore, because they insist upon and realize more faith on the part of thepatients and the operators.An old merchant friend of ours, a man of a strange character with highly exaltedreligious sentiments, after having retired from commerce, began practicingoccult medicine for free through Christian charity in a département in France.He only employs oil, insufflations, and prayers. A trial where he was taken tocourt for the illegal exercise of medicine brought to public attention that, inthe space of five years, ten thousand healings were attributed to him, and thenumber of believers was increasing unceasingly at a rate capable of seriouslyalarming all the doctors in the country.We have seen in Mans a poor nun who was considered a little mad by local people,who cured all the sick people in the neighboring countryside with an elixir anda bandage of her own invention. The elixir was for internal illnesses and thebandage for external illnesses, and in this manner nothing escaped thisuniversal panacea. The bandage never stuck to the skin except in those placeswhere its application was necessary; everywhere else it rolled up and fell offon its own; at least this is what the good sister claimed and what her patientsconfirmed. This thaumaturgist was also taken to court for unlawful competition,since she was reducing the number of clients of all the doctors in thecountryside. She was then strictly cloistered, but soon afterwards they had togive her over to the zeal and the faith of the population. We have seen, on theday of consultations with Sister Jeanne-Françoise, the people of thecountryside, having arrived the previous day, waiting for their turn, lying downat the door to the convent; they had slept on the ground and were only waitingfor the good sister’s elixir and bandage before returning home.The remedy being the same for all maladies, it would seem that the good sisterdid not need to know what her patients suffered from. However, she listened tothem with great attention, and did not administer her cure without knowledge ofthe cause. That was the magical secret. The direction of intention given to theremedy gave it its special virtue. The remedy was insignificant on its own. Theelixir was flavored eau-de-vie mixed with the juices of bitter herbs: thebandage was covered with something similar to theriac judging by the color andodor: it was perhaps opiated Burgundy pitch.498 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__7.xhtml]Whatever the case, her cure worked marvels, and you would get into trouble withthe people of the countryside if you ever suggested that you doubted themiracles of the good sister.We knew near Paris an old thaumaturge gardener who also worked miraculous curesand who poured into his vials the juice of Saint John’s Wort. This gardener hada brother of strong character who mocked the sorcerer. The poor gardener,unnerved by the sarcasms of this miscreant, then began to doubt himself: themiracles ceased, and the thaumaturge, deprived and despairing, died insane.Father Thiers, priest of Vibraye, in his curious Treatise on Superstitions,reports that a woman, affected by an apparently incurable eye disease, havingbeen suddenly and mysteriously cured, had come to confess to a priest abouthaving taken recourse to magic. She had pestered a cleric whom she believed tobe a magician for a long time to give her a sign to carry on her person, thecleric had finally given her a rolled parchment and told her to wash herselfthree times a day with cold water. The priest had her hand him this parchment,and found these words written on it: Eruat diabolos oculos tuos et repleatstercoribus loca vacantia.499 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__8.xhtml] He translatedthese words for the good woman, who was stupefied; but she was no less cured.Insufflation is one of the most important practices in occult medicine, becauseit is the perfect sign of the transmission of life. To inspire in fact means toblow on someone or something, and we already know, through the unique doctrineof Hermes, that the virtue of things created the words and that there is anexact proportion between ideas and words, which are the first forms and theverbal realizations of ideas.Depending on whether the breath is hot or cold, it attracts or repulses. A hotbreath corresponds to positive electricity, and a cold breath to negativeelectricity. Electric and nervous animals fear cold breath, as we can observe bybreathing on a cat whose camaraderie is not welcome. If you gaze fixedly at alion or a tiger and blow in their face, you would astonish them to the point offorcing them to retreat and back off before you.500[9781101992746_EPUB-50__9.xhtml]Hot and prolonged insufflation reestablishes the circulation of the blood, curesrheumatism and gout pains, reestablishes the equilibrium of the humors,501[9781101992746_EPUB-50_10.xhtml] and dissipates lassitude. Coming from a goodand pleasant person, it is a universal sedative. Cold insufflation calms painswhich arise from congestion and fluidic accumulations. One must thereforealternate the two breaths, while observing the polarity of the human organism,and acting in an opposite manner on the two poles, which one submits, one afteranother, to a contrary magnetism. Thus, to cure an inflamed eye, one must warmlyinsufflate the healthy eye, and then practice cold insufflations on theirritated eye at a distance and proportion which is exactly the same as the hotbreaths. Magnetic passes502 [9781101992746_EPUB-50_11.xhtml] themselves act likebreath and are a real breath through transpiration and radiation of the interiorair, all phosphorescent with vital light; slow passes are a hot breath whichgathers and exalts the spirits; quick passes are a cold breath which dispersesforces and neutralizes tendencies towards congestion. Hot breath must be donetransversely or from bottom to top; cold breath has more strength if it isdirected from top to bottom.We do not only breathe through the nostrils and the mouth: the universalporosity of our body is a veritable respiratory apparatus, insufficient, nodoubt, but very useful to life and health. The extremities of the fingers, whereall the nerve endings are, radiate the astral light or draw it in depending onour will. Magnetic passes without physical contact are a simple and lightbreath; contact adds to that breath a sympathetic and balancing impression.Physical contact is good and even necessary for preventing hallucinations at thebeginning of a hypnotism. It is a communion with physical reality, which informsthe brain and returns an imagination which has gotten lost; but the contactshould not be too prolonged when we only wish to magnetize. If absolute andprolonged contact is useful in certain cases, the actions one will exercise onthe subject will be more similar to an incubation or a massage than tomagnetism, properly speaking.We have related examples of incubation taken from the most respected book of theChristians; these examples all have to do with the healing of lethargies reputedto be incurable, since we have agreed to call them resurrections. As to massage,it is still in great use among the Orientals, who practice it in their publicbaths, and which is found to be very beneficial. It is an entire system ofrubbing, pulling, and pressing exercised at length and slowly on all the membersand on all the muscles and whose result is a new equilibrium of forces, afeeling of complete relaxation and well-being with a very noticeable renewal ofagility and vigor.All the power of occult medicine is in the consciousness of the will, and allits art consists in producing faith in its patient. “If thou canst believe,”said the Master, “all things are possible to him that believeth.”503[9781101992746_EPUB-50_12.xhtml] One must dominate the subject through physicalexpression, through tone of voice, through gesture; one must inspire confidencewith a few paternal affectations, loosen him up with a few pleasant and happyphrases. Rabelais, who was more of a magician than he appeared to be, madePantagruelism into a special panacea.504 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__1.xhtml] Hemade the sick laugh, and all the remedies he used thereafter worked better onthem; he established between his patients and himself a magnetic sympathythrough which he communicated his confidence and his good humor; he flatteredthem in his prefaces by calling his patients very illustrious and very precious,and dedicating his books to them. We are also convinced that Gargantua andPantagruel cured more black humors, more dispositions to folly, more arbitrarymanias, in that era of religious hatred and civil wars, than the entire Facultyof Medicine could have observed and studied.Occult medicine is essentially sympathetic. There must be a reciprocal affectionor at least a sense of good will which is established between the doctor and thepatient. Syrups and juleps have hardly any virtue on their own; they are whatthe common opinion between the agent and the patient make of them: homeopathicmedicine completely leaves out both of them without any serious inconvenience.Oil and wine combined either with salt or with camphor could suffice as abandage for all wounds and all exterior rubbing or sedative applications. Oiland wine are considered the best of medicines in the evangelical tradition. Itis the balm of the Samaritan,505 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__2.xhtml] and in theBook of Revelation the prophet, in describing the great exterminations, begs theavenging powers to spare the oil and wine,506 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__3.xhtml]that is to say to leave some hope and a remedy for all those wounds. What wecall amongst ourselves the extreme unction was among the first Christians, aswas the intention of the apostle Saint James, who consigned the precept in hisepistle to the faithful of the entire world, the pure and simple practice of thetraditional medicine of the Master. “Is any sick among you?” he writes. Let himcall for the elders of the Church: and let them pray over him, anointing himwith oil in the name of the Lord.”507 [9781101992746_EPUB-50__4.xhtml] Thisdivine therapeutic was progressively lost, and people took on the habit ofseeing extreme unction as a religious formality which is required before death.Nevertheless, the thaumaturgical virtue of the holy oil was not completelyforgotten by the traditional doctrine, and it is mentioned in the passage in thecatechism dealing with extreme unction.What healed most of all among the first Christians was faith and charity. Mostsicknesses have their source in moral disorders: one must begin by healing thesoul, and the body will be easily healed thereafter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXITHE SCIENCE OF THE PROPHETSThis chapter is dedicated to divination.Divination, in its widest meaning and according to the grammatical significationof the word, is the exercise of divine power and the realization of the divinescience.It is the priesthood of the mage.But divination, according to general opinion, has especially to do with theknowledge of hidden things.To know the most secret thoughts of men, to penetrate the mysteries of the pastand the future, to evoke from century to century the rigorous revelation ofeffects through the exact science of causes: that is what is universally calleddivination.Of all the mysteries of nature, the deepest is that of the heart of man, and yetnature does not allow the depths to be inaccessible. Despite the most profounddissimulation, despite the most clever politics, that mystery traces itself andallows a thousand revealing clues to be observed in the form of the body, in thelight of glances, in movements, in gait, in the voice.The perfect initiate does not even need these clues; he sees the truth in thelight, he senses an impression which manifests the whole man to him, hetraverses hearts with his gaze, and must even feign ignorance, so as to disarmthe fears or the hatred of the wicked whom he knows all too well.The man who has a bad conscience always believes that he is being accused orthat he is under suspicion; if he recognizes himself in a line of collectivesatire, he will take the entire satire as referring to himself and complainloudly that he is being slandered. Always defiant, but as curious as he isfearful, he is for the mage like Satan in the parable or like those scribes whoquestioned Christ in order to tempt him.508 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_fn.xhtml]Always opinionated and always weak, what he fears above all else is to recognizehis wrongdoing. The past troubles him; the future terrifies him; he would liketo compromise with himself and believe that he would be a good man under betterconditions. His life is a continual battle between good aspirations and evilhabits; he sees himself as a philosopher in the manner of Aristippus509[9781101992746_EPUB-51_11.xhtml] or Horace,510 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_12.xhtml]accepting all the corruption of his century as a necessity to which he mustsubmit; he distracts himself with a few philosophical pastimes and deliberatelytakes on the protective smile of Maecenas,511 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_13.xhtml]to persuade himself that he is not a simple exploiter of famine in complicitywith Verres,512 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_14.xhtml] or in complaisance likeTrimalchio.Such men are always exploiters, even when they do good works. If they decide tomake a donation for the public good, they postpone their good deed in order togain more credit. This type of person, whom I am forced to describe, is notanybody in particular: it is a whole class of men, with whom the mage most oftendeals, especially in our century. The mage should mistrust them in the samemanner that they mistrust everyone, because he will find in them the mostunreliable of friends and the most dangerous of enemies.The public exercise of divination cannot be, in our era, suitable to thecharacter of a true adept, because he will often be obliged to have recourse totrickery and sleight of hand in order to keep his clientele and astound hispublic. Professional seers always have spies who inform them of certain thingsrelative to the personal life or habits of those who consult them. A telegraphyof signals is established between the antechamber and the consulting room; theygive a client who they do not know and has come for the first time a number;they give them an appointment for another day and then have them followed; theytalk with their doormen, their neighbors and their household servants, and inthis manner they manage to acquire the details which will then astonish thenaive and provide a charlatan with the esteem which should be reserved tosincere science and to conscientious divination.Divination of events to come is only possible for those events whose realizationare already in some way contained in their cause. The soul, looking through theentire nervous apparatus into the circle of the astral light which influences aman and receives an influence from him, the soul of the seer can embrace in asingle intuition all the loves and hatreds that a man had aroused aroundhimself; the seer can read his intentions and his thoughts, predict theobstacles he will encounter along his path, what violent death might await him;but he cannot predict his private, voluntary, and capricious determinations,from the moment which follows after the consultation, unless the craftiness ofthe seer itself prepares the accomplishment of the prophecy. For example, yousay to a woman who is on the rebound and desires a husband, “You will go tonightor tomorrow night to this show, and, by a bizarre set of circumstances, thiswill result in your future marriage.” You can be sure that, dropping all of herother affairs, this lady will go to the indicated show, will see a man who shewill believe has noticed her, and then hope for a prompt marriage. If thismarriage does not occur, do not worry, she will not blame you, because she willnot wish to lose the hope for a new illusion, and she will return, on thecontrary, to consult you assiduously.We have said that the astral light is the great book of divination; those whohave the aptitude to read in this book have it naturally or have acquired it.There are therefore two classes of seer, the instinctive and the initiated. Itis for this reason that children, the ignorant, shepherds, even idiots, havemore of a disposition for natural divination than scholars and intellectuals.David, a simple herdsman, was a prophet as Solomon, the king of the Cabalistsand the mages, was after him. The perceptions of instinct are often as reliableas those of the science; the least clairvoyant in the astral light are those whoreason the most.Somnambulism is a state of pure instinct: also somnambulists have need to bedirected by a seer of the science; skeptics and reasoners can only mislead them.Divinatory vision only operates in a state of ecstasy, and to arrive at thatstate one must render doubt and delusion impossible by enchaining thought orputting it to sleep.The instruments of divination are thus simply the means of magnetizing yourselfand distracting yourself from the exterior light in order to render yourselfattentive solely to the interior light. It is for this reason that Apolloniusenveloped himself entirely in a coat of wool and in the darkness fixed his gazeon his navel. The magical mirror of du Potet513 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_15.xhtml]is an analogous means to that of Apollonius. Hydromancy514[9781101992746_EPUB-51_16.xhtml] and visions in the thumbnail which is evenlytrimmed and blackened515 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_17.xhtml] are varieties of themagical mirror. Perfumes and evocations numb thought; water or the color blackabsorb visual rays: and a dazzling glare is then produced, a vertigo, which isfollowed by a lucidity in the subjects who have a natural aptitude for it or whoare suitably disposed to it.Geomancy and cartomancy are other means of arriving at the same ends:combinations of symbols and numbers, being both fortuitous and necessary at thesame time, give a relatively true image of the probabilities of destiny so thatthe imagination can see the realities occasioned by the symbols. The more thatone’s interest is excited, the greater the desire to see, the more complete theconfidence in one’s intuition, the clearer the vision will be. Casting geomanticpoints haphazardly or drawing cards thoughtlessly is to play at the lottery likechildren. Random draws are oracular only when they are magnetized byintelligence and directed by faith.Of all the oracles, the Tarot is the most surprising in its responses, becauseall the possible combinations of this universal key of the Cabala providescientific and truthful oracles as their solutions. The Tarot was the uniquebook of the ancient mages; it is the primordial Bible, as we shall prove in thefollowing chapter, and the ancients consulted it, just as the first Christianswould later consult the Lots of the Saints, which is to say verses of the Bibledrawn by chance and determined by thinking of a number.516[9781101992746_EPUB-51_18.xhtml]Mlle Lenormand,517 [9781101992746_EPUB-51__1.xhtml] the most famous of ourmodern seeresses, knew nothing of the science of the Tarot, or knew no more thanEtteilla’s explications, which are obscurities thrown at the light. She knewneither high magic nor the Cabala, and her head was stuffed with a misdirectedscholarship, but she was intuitive by instinct, and that instinct was rarelywrong. The books she left behind are a sort of legitimistic mumbo jumbo lacedwith classical citations, but her oracles, inspired by the presence andmagnetism of her consultants, were often surprising. She was a woman for whomthe natural affections of her sex were replaced by a burgeoning imagination anda wandering spirit. She lived and died a virgin, like the ancient Druidesses ofthe Ile de Sein.518 [9781101992746_EPUB-51__2.xhtml]If nature had endowed her with some beauty, she would have easily, in pastepochs, played in Gaul the role of a Melusine or a Veleda.519[9781101992746_EPUB-51__3.xhtml]The more you employ ceremonies in the exercise of divination, the more youexcite your and your consultant’s imaginations. The Conjuration of the Four, theprayer of Solomon, the magic sword used to dismiss phantoms can thus besuccessfully used; you must also evoke the spirit of the day and hour520[9781101992746_EPUB-51__4.xhtml] in which you are operating and offer him hisparticular perfume; then you put yourself in magnetic and intuitive rapport withclients by asking them which animal they find sympathetic to and which theydislike, which flowers they like and which colors they prefer. Flowers, colors,and animals all have an analogical classification with the spirits of theCabala. Those who like the color blue are idealists and dreamers; those who likered are materialists and prone to anger; those who like yellow are fantasticaland capricious; lovers of green often have a mercantile or wily character; thefriends of the color black are influenced by Saturn; pink is the color of Venus,etc. Those who like horses work hard and are of noble character, yet they areflexible and docile; the friends of dogs are loving and faithful; friends ofcats are independent and libertines. Sincere people are afraid most of all ofspiders; proud souls dislike the serpent; upright and delicate people cannotstand rats and mice; pleasure seekers have a horror for the toad, because toadsare cold, solitary, hideous, and sad. Flowers have sympathies analogous to thoseof animals and colors, and since magic is the science of universal analogies, asingle preference, a single disposition of a person, allows one to divine allthe others. It is the application of Cuvier’s analogical anatomy521[9781101992746_EPUB-51__5.xhtml] to phenomena of the moral realm.The physiognomy of the face and the body, the wrinkles on the forehead, thelines on the hands also furnish mages with precious clues. Metoposcopy andchiromancy have become sciences of their own, whose risky and purely conjecturalobservations, have been compared, discussed, and then united in a body ofdoctrine by Goclenius, Belot, Rampalle, Indagine, and Taisnier.522[9781101992746_EPUB-51__6.xhtml] This last author’s book is the mostconsiderable and complete; it reunites and comments on the observations andconjectures of all the others.A modern observer, the Chevalier d’Arpentigny,523[9781101992746_EPUB-51__7.xhtml] provided chiromancy with a new degree ofcertitude with his remarks on the analogies which really exist between aperson’s character and the form, either complete or in its details, of theirhands. This new science was developed and refined since by an artist who is alsoa man of letters who is full of originality and finesse. The disciple hadsurpassed the master, and we have already cited the kind and spiritualDesbarolles as a veritable magician of chiromancy, one of the travelers whom thestoryteller Alexandre Dumas likes to surround himself with in his cosmopolitannovels.One must also ask the consultant about his habitual dreams: dreams arereflections of life, either interior or exterior. The ancient philosophers paida great deal of attention to them, the patriarchs saw assured revelations inthem, and the majority of religious revelations occurred in dreams. The monstersof hell are the nightmares of Christianity, and, as the author of Smarra524[9781101992746_EPUB-51__8.xhtml] has remarked in a spiritual manner, never wouldthe paintbrush or the chisel have produced such horrors if they had not beenseen in dreams.One should be wary of persons whose imagination habitually reflects horrors.Temperament also manifests itself through dreams, and since temperamentexercises a continual influence over life, it is necessary to know it well inorder to make conjectures with certitude about the destiny of a person. Dreamsof blood, of pleasure, and of light indicate a sanguinary temperament; dreams ofwater, of mud, of rain, of tears result from a more phlegmatic disposition;nocturnal fires, darkness, terrors, and phantoms belong to the bilious and tomelancholics.Synesius, one of the greatest Christian bishops of the first centuries, discipleof the pure and beautiful Hypatia, who was massacred by fanatics after havingbeen the glorious teacher of that beautiful Alexandrian school of whose heritageChristianity should have partaken; Synesius, a lyrical poet like Pindar andCallimachus, religious as Orpheus, a Christian like Spyridon of Tremetousia,left a treatise on dreams which was commented upon by Cardano. We are littleconcerned in our day with these magnificent researches into the spirit, becausesuccessive fantacisms have virtually forced the world to resign itself toscientific and religious rationalism. Saint Paul burned Trismegistus; Omarburned the disciples of Trismegistus and of Saint Paul. O persecutors! Oarsonists! O mockers! when will you have finished your work of darkness anddestruction?Trithemius, one of the greatest mages of the Christian period, theirreproachable abbot of a Benedictine monastery, a scholarly theologian andteacher of Cornelius Agrippa, has left, among his unappreciated and invaluableworks, a treatise entitled De septum secundeis, id est intelligentiis sivespiritibus orbes post Deum moventibus.525 [9781101992746_EPUB-51__9.xhtml] It isthe key to all the ancient and new prophecies, and a mathematical means, easyand historical, of surpassing Isaiah and Jeremiah in the prediction of all greatevents to come. The author sketches out the philosophy of history and shares theexistence of the entire world between the seven spirits of the Cabala. It is thegreatest and widest interpretation that has ever been made regarding the sevenangels of Revelation who appear by turns with trumpets then cups to spread theVerb and the realization of the Verb throughout the world. The reign of eachangel is 354 years and 4 months. The first is Oriphiel, angel of Saturn, whobegan his reign on March 13 in the first year of the world (because the world,according to Trithemius, was created on the thirteenth of March): his reign wasthat of savagery and primitive night. Then came the empire of Anael, the spiritof Venus, which began on June 24 in the 354th year of the world; thus lovebecame the preceptor of men; he created the family, and the family led toassociation and the primordial city. The first civilizers were poets inspired bylove, and then through the exaltation of poetry, religion, fanaticism, anddebauchery were produced, which later brought on the flood. And all of thislasted until the eighth month of the 708th year of the world, that is to sayuntil the twenty-fifth of October, and then began the reign of Zachariel, angelof Jupiter, under whom men began to know and fight over ownership of the fieldsand habitations. It was the epoch of the foundation of cities and thedelineation of empires; civilization and war were the consequences. Then theneed for commerce was felt, and it was then that, in the 1,063th year of theworld, on February 24, that Raphael’s reign began, the angel of Mercury, theangel of the science and the verb, the angel of intelligence and industry. Andthus letters were invented.The first language was hieroglyphic and universal, and the monument to it whichstill remains is the book of Enoch, of Cadmus, of Thoth, or of Palamedes, theCabalistic clavicule later adopted by Solomon, the mystical book of Teraphim,the Urim and Thummim, the primordial Genesis of Zohar and Guillaume Postel, themystical wheel of Ezekiel, the rota of the Cabalists, the Tarot of the mages andthe Gypsies. It was then that the arts were invented and navigation was firstattempted; relationships extended, needs were multiplied, and there soonarrived, that is to say on June 26 in the 1,417th year of the world, the reignof Samael, angel of Mars, epoch of the corruption of all men and the universaldeluge. After a long breakdown, the world struggled to become reborn underGabriel, angel of the Moon, who began his reign on March 28 in the 1,771st yearof the world: it was then that Noah’s family multiplied and repopulated all theareas of the Earth, after the confusion of Babel, up until the reign of Michael,angel of the Sun, which began on February 24 in the 2,126th year of the world,and it is to that era that one must ascribe the origin of the first dominations,the empire of the children of Nimrod, the birth of the sciences and religions onearth, the first conflicts between despotism and liberty.Trithemius pursues this curious study across the ages and demonstrates over thesame eras the return of ruin, then civilization renascent through poetry andlove; empires reestablished by the family, aggrandized through commerce,destroyed by war, repaired by universal and progressive civilization, thenabsorbed by great empires, which are the syntheses of history. The work ofTrithemius is, from this point of view, more universal and independent than thatof Bossuet, and is an absolute key to the philosophy of history. His rigorouscalculations go up to the month of November of the year 1879, the era of thereign of Michael and the foundation of a new universal kingdom. This kingdom hasbeen prepared for by three and a half centuries of anguish and three and a halfcenturies of hope: epochs which coincide precisely with the sixteenth,seventeenth, eighteenth, and half of the nineteenth centuries of the lunar duskand hope; with the fourteenth, thirteenth, twelfth, and half of the eleventhcenturies with trials, ignorance, anguish, and the plagues of all of nature. Wesee then, after this calculation, that in 1879, that is to say in twenty-fouryears, a universal empire which will be founded and which will provide universalpeace to the world.526 [9781101992746_EPUB-51_10.xhtml] This empire will bepolitical and religious; it will provide a solution to all the problems stirredup in our day and will last for 354 years and 4 months; and then the reign ofOriphiel will return, that is to say an epoch of silence and of night. The nextuniversal empire, being under the reign of the Sun, will belong to him who holdsthe keys to the Orient, which the princes from the four corners of the worldfight over at this moment; but intelligence and action are, in the superiorrealms, the forces which govern the Sun, and the nation which today on Earth nowhas the initiative of intelligence and of life will also have the keys of theOrient and will found the universal kingdom. Perhaps it will have to suffer acrucifixion and a martyrdom analogous to those of the God-man; but, dead oralive among the nations, its spirit will triumph, and all the peoples of theworld will recognize and follow the standard of France, always victorious ormiraculously resuscitated. Such is the prophecy of Trithemius, confirmed by allour predictions and backed by our resolutions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIITHE BOOK OF HERMESWe arrive at the end of our work, and it is here that we must provide theuniversal key and have our last word.The universal key of the magical arts is the key to all the ancient religiousdoctrines, the key to the Cabala and to the Bible, it is the Clavicle ofSolomon.This clavicle or little key, which was thought to be lost for centuries, we havefound, and with it we have been able to open all the sepulchers of the ancientworld, make the dead speak, see again in all their splendor the monuments of thepast, understand the enigmas of all sphinxes, and penetrate into allsanctuaries.Among the ancients, the use of this key was permitted only to the high priests,and they did not even entrust the secret to elite initiates. Nonetheless here isthat key:It was a hieroglyphic and numeral alphabet, expressing in characters and numbersa series of universal and absolute ideas; and then a scale of ten numbersmultiplied by four symbols and linked together by twelve figures representingthe twelve signs of the zodiac, plus four spirits, those of the four cardinalpoints.The symbolic quaternary, figured in the mysteries of Memphis and Thebes527[9781101992746_EPUB-52_fn.xhtml] by the four forms of the sphinx, the man, theeagle, the lion and the bull, corresponded to the four elements of the ancientworld and were represented by symbols: water, by the cup which is held by man orAquarius; air, by the circle or halo which encircles the head of the celestialeagle; fire, by the wood which feeds it, by the tree which the heat of the Earthand of the Sun makes fructify, and finally by the scepter of royalty, of whichthe lion is the emblem; the Earth, by the sword of Mithra, who every yearimmolates the sacred bull and through its blood makes flow the sap which swellsall the fruits of the Earth.These four signs, with all their analogies, are the explication of the uniqueword hidden in all sanctuaries, the word which the bacchantes528[9781101992746_EPUB-52_11.xhtml] seemed to divine in their drunkenness when incelebrating the feasts of Iacchus they exalted themselves until delirium for IOEVOHE!529 [9781101992746_EPUB-52_19.xhtml] What then did this mysterious wordmean? It was the name of the four primordial letters in the mother language: theYOD, symbol of the vine stock, or the scepter of the paternal Noah; the HEH,image of the cup of libations, sign of divine maternity; the VAU, which unitedthe two preceding signs together, and which has as a symbol in India the greatand mysterious lingam. Such was, in the divine word, the triple sign of theternary; and then the maternal letter appeared a second time to express thefecundity of nature and woman, and also to formulate the doctrine of universaland progressive analogies descending from causes to effects and ascending fromeffects back to the causes. Note that they did not pronounce the sacred word;they spelled it and said it in four words, which are the four sacred words: YODHEH VAU HEH.The scholar Gaffarel does not doubt that the Teraphim of the Hebrews, throughthe means of which they consulted the oracles of urim and thummim, were thefigures of the four animals of the Cabala, whose symbols were summarized, as weshall soon explain, by the sphinx or cherubim of the Ark. But he cites, inregards to the usurped teraphim of Micah,530 [9781101992746_EPUB-52_20.xhtml] acurious passage by Philo Judaeus which is an entire revelation on the ancientand sacerdotal origin of our Tarot. Here is how Gaffarel expresses himself:“Thus he says (Philo the Jew), speaking of a hidden history in a chapterentitled Judges, that Micah made from fine gold and silver three figurines ofyoung boys and three young calves, as many of a lion, an eagle, a dragon, and adove: so that if anyone came to ask him to discover some secret regarding theirwife, he would ask the dove; regarding their children, he would use the youngboy; regarding wealth, through the eagle; regarding strength and power, throughthe lion; regarding fecundity, through the cherub or calf; regarding the lengthof days and of years, through the dragon.” This revelation of Philo’s, eventhough Gaffarel makes little of it, is for us of the highest importance. Here,in fact, is our key to the quaternary, here are the images of the four symbolicanimals which are found in the twenty-first key of the Tarot, which is to say inthe third septenary, thus repeating the three and summarizing all the symbolismwhich the three superimposed septenaries express; then the antagonism of colors,expressed by the dove and the dragon; the circle or ROTA, formed by the dragonor the snake to express the length of days; finally the Cabalistic divination ofthe entire Tarot as a whole, as it would later be practiced by the Gypsies,whose secrets were guessed at and imperfectly rediscovered by Etteilla.We see in the Bible that the high priests consulted the Lord on the golden tableof the holy Ark, between the cherubim or sphinxes with the body of a bull andthe wings of an eagle, and that they consulted with the aid of the teraphim,with the urim, with the thummim and with the ephod.531[9781101992746_EPUB-52_21.xhtml] The ephod was, as we know, a magical square oftwelve numbers and twelve words engraved on precious stones. The word teraphim,in Hebrew, signifies hieroglyphs or figurative signs; the urim and the thummim,were the high and the low, the orient and the occident, the yes and the no, andthese signs corresponded to the two columns Jachin and Boaz. Thus when the grandpriest wished to make the oracle speak, he drew at random the teraphim or goldenstrips which had the images of the four holy words on them, and placed themthree by three around the rationale or ephod, between the urim and thummim, thatis to say between the two onyx gems which served as clips for the chains of theephod. The right onyx signified Gedulah, or mercy and magnificence; the leftrelated to Geburah and signified justice and anger, and if, for example, thesign of the lion was found near the stone in which was engraved the name of thetribe of Judah on the left side, the grand priest read the oracle in thismanner: “The rod of the Lord is angry at Judah.” If the teraphim represented manor the cup and was also found to the left, near the stone of Benjamin, the grandpriest read: “The mercy of the Lord is weary of the offenses of Benjamin, whoabuses His love. This is why He shall pour upon him his cup of anger, etc.” Whenthe sovereign priesthood ended in Israel, when all the oracles of the world weresilenced in the presence of the Verb made man, which spoke through the mouth ofthe most popular and most sweet of sages, when the Ark was lost, the sanctuaryprofaned, and the temple destroyed, the mysteries of the ephod and the teraphim,which were no longer traced upon gold and precious stones, were then written orrather drawn by a few Cabalist sages on ivory, on parchment, on silvered andgilded leather, and then finally on simple cards, which were always regarded assuspect by the official Church, as though containing a dangerous key to themysteries. It is from there that those Tarots came from antiquity, as revealedto the scholar Court de Gébelin by the science of hieroglyphs and numbersitself, which later so often exercised Etteilla’s doubtful perspicacity andtenacious investigations.Court de Gébelin, in the eighth volume of his Monde Primitif, provided thefigures of the twenty-two keys and of the four aces of the Tarot, anddemonstrates its perfect analogy with all the symbols from the highestantiquity; he then tries to provide an explanation as to why, and naturallyloses his way because he does not take as his point of departure the universaland sacred tetragrammaton, the IO EVOHE of the Bacchanalia, the YOD HEH VAU HEHof the sanctuary, the [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-1.jpg] of the Cabala.Etteilla, or Alliette, was solely preoccupied with his system of divination andwith the material profit he could extract from it; an ex-barber, having neverlearned French nor even spelling, pretended to reform and thus claim ownershipover the book of Thoth. On the Tarot he had engraved, and which has become veryrare, we can read on the twenty-eighth card (the eight of wands) this naiveadvertisement: “Etteilla, professor of algebra, renovator of cartomancy andeditors [sic] of modern errors of this ancient book of Thoth, resides at 48, ruede l’Oseille, in Paris.” Etteilla would certainly have done better in notediting the errors of which he speaks: his work resulted in the ancient bookdiscovered by Court de Gébelin falling into the domain of vulgar magic andfortune-telling. He who wishes to prove too much proves nothing, says an axiomof logic; Etteilla provides another example of this, and yet his efforts broughthim to a certain understanding of the Cabala, as we can see in a few rarepassages from his generally unreadable books.The true initiates contemporary with Etteilla, the Rosicrucians, for example,and the Martinists, who were in possession of the true Tarot, as a book bySaint-Martin proves,532 [9781101992746_EPUB-52_22.xhtml] whose division intochapters is that of the Tarot, and this passage by an enemy of the Rosicrucians:“They pretend to have a volume in which they can learn all that is found inother books which have or could never have existed. This volume is the reason bywhich they find the prototype for all that exists through the faculty ofanalysis, to make abstractions, to form a kind of intellectual world, and tocreate all possible beings. Look upon the philosophical cards, theosophists,microcosmites, etc.” Conspiracy against the Catholic Religion and theSovereigns, by the author of The Veil Raised for the Curious533[9781101992746_EPUB-52_23.xhtml] (Paris: Crapart, 1792). The true initiates, wewere saying, who held the secret of the Tarot among their greatest mysteries,made no complaint about Etteilla’s errors, and allowed him not to unveil, but tore-veil the arcanum of the true clavicle of Solomon. It was not without profoundastonishment that we rediscovered, intact and still ignored, that key to all thedoctrines and to all the philosophies of the ancient world. I say a key, and itis truly one, having a circle of four decades as a ring, and as its shaft orbody the scale of twenty-two characters, then as a turning point the threedegrees of the ternary, as was understood and drawn by Guillaume Postel in hisKey to Things Hidden Since the Beginning of the World, a key which he thusindicates as being its occult name, known only to initiates:[image/Doctrine_Magic_29.jpg]a word which can be read as ROTA, and which symbolizes Ezekiel’s wheel, orTAROT, and is thus synonymous with the AZOTH of the hermetic philosophers. It isa word which Cabalistically expresses the doctrinal and natural absolute; it isformed from the letters of Christ’s monogram, according to the Greeks and theHebrews. The Latin R or the Greek P is found in the middle, between the alphaand the omega of the Book of Revelation, then the sacred Tau, image of thecross, encloses the word entirely, as we have represented it here[9781101992746_EPUB-52.xhtml#image_pageMap_392_0].Without the Tarot, the magic of the ancients is a book which is closed for us,and it is impossible to penetrate any of the great mysteries of the Cabala. TheTarot alone provides for the interpretation of the magical squares of Agrippaand of Paracelsus, as we can be convinced of by forming these same squares withthe keys of the tarot and by reading the hieroglyphs, which are thus foundassembled.Here are the seven magical squares of the planetary spirits according toParacelsus:SATURN[image/Doctrine_Magic_30.jpg]JUPITER[image/Doctrine_Magic_31.jpg]MARS[image/Doctrine_Magic_32.jpg]SUN[image/Doctrine_Magic_33.jpg]VENUS[image/Doctrine_Magic_34.jpg]MERCURY[image/Doctrine_Magic_35.jpg]MOON[image/Doctrine_Magic_36.jpg]By adding each of the columns of these squares, you invariably obtain the numberwhich is characteristic of the planet, and, by finding the explication of thatnumber through the hieroglyphs of the Tarot, you look for the meaning of all thefigures, either triangular, square, or cruciform, that you shall find formed bythe numbers. The consequence of this operation will result in a complete andprofound understanding of all the allegories and of all the mysteries hidden bythe ancients under the symbol of each planet, or rather of each personificationof the influences, either celestial or human, that govern all of life’s events.We have said that the twenty-two keys of the Tarot are the twenty-two letters ofthe Cabalistic primordial alphabet. Here is a table of variants of this alphabetaccording to diverse Hebrew Cabalists.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-2.jpg] Being, mind, man, or God; thecomprehensible object; the mother unity of numbers, the first substance.All these ideas are expressed hieroglyphically by the figure of the Magus. Hisbody and his arms form the letter [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-3.jpg]; hewears around his head a halo in the form of ∞, symbol of life and the universalmind; before him are swords, cups, and pentacles, and he raises a miraculouswand towards the sky. He has a juvenile figure and curly hair, like Apollo orMercury; he has an assuring smile on his lips and looks out with intelligenteyes.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-4.jpg] The house of God and man, thesanctuary, the law, Gnosis, the Cabala, the occult church, the binary, woman,mother.Hieroglyph for the Tarot, High Priestess: a woman crowned with a tiara, havingthe horns of the Moon or of Isis, her head surrounded by a veil, the solar crosson her chest, and holding upon her knees a book which she hides with her coat.Your author disagrees with a so-called account of Pope Joan534[9781101992746_EPUB-52_24.xhtml] and has found and made use of, for better orfor worse, regarding his thesis, two curious and ancient figures which he foundof the papesse or high priestess of the Tarot. These two figures provide thehigh priestess with all the attributes of Isis; in one of them, she holds andcaresses the hand of her son Horus; in the other, she has long and thin hair;she sits between two binary columns, wears on her breast a four-rayed sun,places one hand on a book, and with the other hand makes the sign of sacerdotalesotericism, which is to say that she stretches out only three fingers and keepsthe others folded in the sign of mystery; behind her head is a veil, and on eachside of her seat is a sea upon which lotus flowers flourish. I feel deeply sorryfor the misguided erudite who only wished to see in this ancient symbol amonumental portrait of his supposed Pope Joan.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-5.jpg] The verb, the ternary, the plenitude,fecundity, nature, the generation of the three worlds.Hieroglyph, the Empress: a winged woman, crowned, sitting and holding the worldat the end of her scepter; she has as a sign the eagle, image of the soul and oflife.This woman is the Venus-Urania of the Greeks and was represented by Saint John,in his Apocalypse, by a woman dressed in the Sun, crowned by a dozen stars, andhaving the Moon at her feet. It is the mystical quintessence of the ternary, itis spirituality, it is immortality, it is the queen of heaven.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-6.jpg] The door or government among theOrientals, initiation, power, the tetragrammaton, the quaternary, the cubicstone or its base.Hieroglyph, the Emperor: a sovereign whose body represents a right triangle, andthe legs a cross, image of the Athanor of the philosophers.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-7.jpg] Indication, demonstration, teaching,laws, symbolism, philosophy, religion.Hieroglyph, the Pope or grand hierophant. In more modern Tarots, this sign hasbeen replaced by the image of Jupiter. The grand hierophant, sitting between thetwo columns of Hermes and Solomon, which makes for the sign of esotericism,leans on a cross with three crossbeams with a triangular form. Before him, twosubordinate ministers are kneeling, in such a manner that above him he has thecapitals of the two columns and below535 [9781101992746_EPUB-52_25.xhtml] himthe heads of the ministers, he is the center of the quinary and represents thedivine pentagram of which he provides the complete meaning. In effect, thecolumns are necessity or law; the heads are liberty or action. From each columnto each head we can draw a line, and two lines from each column to each of thetwo heads. We thus obtain a square cut in four triangles by a cross, and in themiddle of this cross would be the grand hierophant, we might say almost like agarden spider in the center of its web, if this image could be suitable forthings of truth, of glory, and of light.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-8.jpg] Chained series, hook, lingam,entanglement, union, embrace, struggle, antagonism, combination, equilibrium.Hieroglyph, man between Vice and Virtue. Above him shines the Sun of truth, andwithin this Sun, Love stretches his bow and threatens vice with his arrow. Inthe order of the ten sephiroth, this symbol corresponds to Tiphareth, that is tosay idealism and beauty. The number six represents the antagonism of the twoternaries, that is to say absolute negation and absolute affirmation. It is thusthe number of works and of freedom; this is why it also has to do with moralbeauty and glory.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-9.jpg] Weapon, glaive, flaming sword of thecherub, sacred septenary, triumph, royalty, priesthood.Hieroglyph, a cubic chariot of four columns with starry azure drapes. In thechariot, between the four columns, a triumphant victor crowned with a circleupon which arise and radiate three golden pentagrams. The triumphant victor hason his breastplate three superimposed set squares; on the shoulders are the urimand the thummim of the sovereign sacrificator, symbolized by the two crescentmoons of Gedulah and Gevurah; he holds in his hand a scepter surmounted by aglobe, a square, and a triangle; his attitude is proud and tranquil. Harnessedto the chariot is the double sphinx, or two sphinxes attached at the lowerabdomen; one pulls in one direction and one in the other, but one of the twoturns its head, and they look in the same direction. The sphinx which turns itshead is black; the other is white. On the square which forms the front of thechariot, we see the Indian lingam above, which is found the flying sphere of theEgyptians. This hieroglyph, of which we provide here the exact figure, is themost beautiful and perhaps the most complete of all the hieroglyphs which makeup the clavicule of the Tarot.[image/Doctrine_Magic_28.jpg]THE CHARIOT OF HERMES, SEVENTH KEY OF THE TAROT.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-10.jpg] Balance, attraction and repulsion,life, fear, promise and threat.Hieroglyph, Justice with her sword and balance.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-11.jpg] Good, the loathing of evil,morality, wisdom.Hieroglyph, a sage leaning on his staff and carrying before him a lamp; he iscompletely enveloped in his coat. His inscription is The Hermit or The Monk,because of the hood on his oriental coat; but his true name is Prudence, and hethus completes the four cardinal virtues, which had seemed odd to Court deGébelin and Etteilla.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-12.jpg] Principle, manifestation, praise,virile honor, phallus, virile fecundity, paternal scepter.Hieroglyph, The Wheel of Fortune, that is to say the cosmogonic wheel ofEzekiel, with an ascending Hermanubis to the right, a descending Typhon to theleft, and a sphinx balanced above and holding a sword in its lion claws. Anadmirable symbol, disfigured by Etteilla, who had replaced Typhon with a man,Hermanubis with a mouse, and the sphinx with a monkey. An allegory worthy ofEtteilla’s Cabala.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-13.jpg] The hand in the act of taking andholding.Hieroglyph, Strength, a woman crowned with the vital ∞ and who peacefully andeffortlessly closes the jaws of a furious lion.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-14.jpg] Example, teaching, public lesson.Hieroglyph, a man who is hung by one foot and whose hands are tied behind hisback in such a manner that his body forms a triangle pointing downwards, and hislegs form a cross above the triangle. The gallows have the form of a Hebrew tau;the trees which support it each have six cut branches. We have explained thissymbol of sacrifice and the accomplished work elsewhere; we will not repeat ithere.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-15.jpg] The heaven of Jupiter and of Mars,domination and force, rebirth, creation and destruction.Hieroglyph, Death who scythes crowned heads, in a meadow where we see mengrowing.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-16.jpg] The heaven of the Sun, temperatures,seasons, movement, the changes of life, which are always new and always thesame.Hieroglyph, Temperance, an angel with the sign of the Sun on his forehead, andon his breast the square and triangle of the septenary, pours from one cup toanother the two essences which compose the elixir of life.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-17.jpg] The heaven of Mercury, occultscience, magic, commerce, eloquence, mystery, moral strength.Hieroglyph, The Devil, the goat of Mendes or the Baphomet of the temple with allits pantheistic attributes. This hieroglyph is the only one which Etteillaperfectly understood and properly interpreted.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-18.jpg] The heaven of the Moon, alterations,subversions, changes, weakness.Hieroglyph, a tower struck by lightning, probably the tower of Babel. Twopersons, no doubt Nimrod and his false prophet or his minister, are thrown downbelow the ruins from above. One of the persons, in falling, perfectly representsthe letter [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-19.jpg], Ayin.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-20.jpg] The heaven of the soul, effusions ofthought, the moral influence of the idea over the forms, immortality.Hieroglyph, the brilliant star and eternal youth. We have provided thedescription of this figure elsewhere.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-21.jpg] The elements, the visible world, thereflected light, the material forms, symbolism.Hieroglyph, the Moon, dew, a crawfish in water rising towards the Earth, a dogand a wolf howling at the Moon and standing at the foot of two towers, a pathwhich becomes lost in the horizon and which is sprayed with droplets of blood.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-22.jpg] Mixtures, the head, the summit, theprince of the sky.Hieroglyph, a radiant Sun and two naked children who hold hands in a fortifiedenclosure. In other Tarots, it is a spinner uncoiling the destinies; in others,a naked child astride a white horse, holding a scarlet standard.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-23.jpg] The vegetative, the generativevirtue of the earth, eternal life.Hieroglyph, Judgment. A spirit sounds a trumpet and the dead come out of theirtombs; these dead who become again living are a man, a woman, and a child: theternary of human life.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-24.jpg] The sensory, the flesh, eternallife.Hieroglyph, The Fool: a man dressed as a jester, walking haphazardly, loadedwith a bag which he carries behind him, and which are no doubt full of hisabsurdities and his vices; his disorderly clothes display openly what should behidden, and a tiger who is following him bites him without his thinking ofavoiding it or defending himself.[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-25.jpg] The microcosm, the summary ofeverything in everything.Hieroglyph, Kether, or the Cabalistic crown between four mysterious animals; inthe middle of the crown, we see Truth holding a magic wand in each hand.Such are the twenty-two keys of the Tarot, which explain the numbers. Thus themage, or the key of unity, explains the four aces with their quadruple andprogressive signification in the three worlds and the first principle. Thus theace of coins or of the circle, is the soul of the world; the ace of swords isthe active intelligence; the ace of cups is the loving intelligence; the ace ofwands is the creative intelligence; they are also the principles of movement, ofprogress, and of fecundity and power. Each number, multiplied by a key, givesanother number, which, explained in its turn by the keys, completes thephilosophical and religious revelation contained in each sign. Yet each of thefifty-six cards can be multiplied by the twenty-two keys, one after the other;the result is a series of combinations providing all of the most surprisingresults of revelation and of light. It is a veritable philosophical machine,which prevents the spirit from becoming lost while allowing for its initiativeand freedom; it is mathematics applied to the absolute, it is the alliance ofthe positive with the ideal, it is an assemblage of thoughts which are asrigorously correct as numbers, finally it is perhaps that which the human geniushas ever conceived which is the most simple and the most grand.The manner in which to read the hieroglyphs of the Tarot is to dispose themeither in a square or in a triangle, by placing the even numbers in antagonismwith and by reconciling them with the odd numbers. Four signs always express theabsolute within any order and are explained by the fifth. Thus the solution toall magical questions is that of the pentagram, and all the antinomies areexplained by the harmonious unity.Thus disposed, the Tarot is a true oracle and responds to all possible questionswith more clarity and infallibility than the android of Albertus Magnus,536[9781101992746_EPUB-52__1.xhtml] to such an extent that a prisoner without anybooks could, in a few years, if he had only a Tarot deck and knew how to use it,acquire universal science, and would speak of everything with a doctrine withoutequal and with an inexhaustible eloquence. This wheel is the true key to thenotory art537 [9781101992746_EPUB-52__2.xhtml] and the Great Art of RaymondLully;538 [9781101992746_EPUB-52__3.xhtml] it is the true secret of thetransmutation of darkness into light, it is the first and the most important ofall the arcana of the Great Work.By the means of this universal key to symbolism, all the allegories of India, ofEgypt, and of Judea become clear; the Revelation of Saint John is a Cabalisticbook whose meaning is rigorously indicated by the figures and by the numbers ofthe urim, of the thummim, of the teraphim, and of the ephod, all summarized andcompleted by the Tarot; the ancient sanctuaries have no more mysteries, and weunderstand for the first time the signification of the occult objects of theHebrews.539 [9781101992746_EPUB-52__4.xhtml] Who does not see in the goldentablet, crowned and supported by the cherubim, which covered the Ark of theCovenant and served as a propitiatory, the same symbols as those in thetwenty-first key of the Tarot? The Ark was a hieroglyphic summary of all theCabalistic doctrine, it contained the Yod or the flowering wand of Aaron, the Heor the cup, the omer containing the manna, the two tablets of the law, a symbolwhich is analogous to the sword of justice, and the manna contained in the omer,four things which marvelously translate the letters of the divineTetragrammaton.Gaffarel skillfully proved that the cherubim or cherubs of the Ark were in theform of calves; but what he did not know was that instead of two there werefour, two at each end, as it is expressly stated in the text, a section which ismisunderstood by most commentators.Thus in the verses 18 and 19 of chapter 25 of Exodus, one must translate theHebrew text in this manner:You shall make two calves or sphinxes made of gold and worked by hammer at eachside of the oracle.And you shall place one facing one side, and the other facing the other side.The cherubs or sphinxes were in effect coupled in pairs at each side of the Ark,and their heads turned towards the four corners of the Mercy Seat, which theycovered with their wings which were curved into a vault, thus shading the crownand the golden tablet, which they supported on their shoulders while looking ateach other in the eyes and looking at the Mercy Seat. (See the figure.)The ark thus had three sections, or three levels, representing Atziluth,Yetzirah, and Briah, the three worlds of the Cabala: the base of the coffer, towhich were attached the four rings for the two carrying poles analogous to thecolumns of the temple, Jachin and Boaz; the body of the coffer, from which thesphinxes came out in relief; and the cover, shaded by the wings of the sphinxes.The base represented the realm of salt, to speak in the language of the adeptsof Hermes; the coffer was the realm of mercury or of azoth and the cover was therealm of sulfur, or of fire. The other cultic objects were no less allegorical,but we would need an entire book to describe and explain them.[image/Doctrine_Magic_37.jpg]Saint-Martin, in his Natural Tableau of the Relationships which Exist betweenGod, Man, and the Universe, had followed, as we have said, the division of theTarot, and provides for the twenty-two keys a rather lengthy mysticalcommentary. Postel had the same discretion, and while only naming the Tarot inthe figure of his key to the arcanum, he designates it in the rest of the bookunder the name of Genesis of Enoch. The character of Enoch, author of the firstsacred book, is effectively identical with that of Thoth for the Egyptians, ofCadmus for the Phoenicians, and of Palamedes for the Greeks.540[9781101992746_EPUB-52__5.xhtml]We have found, in a rather extraordinary manner, a medal from the sixteenthcentury, which is a key to the Tarot. We do not really know if we should mentionthat this medal and the place where we had found it was shown to us in a dreamby the divine Paracelsus: whatever the case, the medal is in our possession. Itrepresents, on one side, the mage, in German dress of the sixteenth century,holding his belt in one hand and in the other the pentagram; before him, on histable, between an open book and a closed purse, ten coins or talismans areplaced in two lines of three each and in one square of four; the feet of thetable form two [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-26.jpg], and the feet of themage form two upturned [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-27.jpg] which looklike this [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-28.jpg]. The reverse side of themedal contains the letters of the alphabet placed in a magical square in thisway:A B C D EF G H I KL M N O PQ R S T VX V Z NWe should remark that this alphabet has only twenty-two letters, the V and the Nhaving been repeated twice, and that it is arranged in four quinaries and aquaternary as the key at the base. The four final letters are two combinationsof the binary and the ternary, and read Cabalistically they form the word AZOTH,by rendering the configurations of the letters into their values in primordialHebrew and by taking the N for a [image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-29.jpg],the Z for what it is in Latin, the V for the Hebrew vau[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-30.jpg], which is pronounced like O betweentwo vowels or letters which function as vowels, and the X for the primordialTau, which had that same shape. The entire Tarot is thus explained on thismarvelous medal, worthy of Paracelsus, and which we hold at the disposition ofthe curious. The letters, placed four times by five, have as a summary the word[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-31.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-32.jpg][image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-33.jpg] analogous to[image/9781101992746_EPUB-52_vector-34.jpg], to INRI, and containing all themysteries of the Cabala.The book of the Tarot having such high scientific importance, it is worth hopingthat it shall no longer be altered. We have gone through the collection ofancient Tarots in the Imperial Library, and it is there that we gathered all thehieroglyphs for which we provide the description. There remains an importantwork to be done: that is to engrave and publish a Tarot which is rigorouslycomplete and carefully executed. Perhaps we shall do so soon.We find vestiges of the Tarot among all the peoples of the world. The ItalianTarot is, as we have said, the best conserved and the most faithful, but wecould perfect it more with precious information borrowed from Spanish decks: thetwo of cups, for example, in Naibis is completely Egyptian, and we see thereintwo antique vases whose handles are formed by ibises,541[9781101992746_EPUB-52__6.xhtml] with a cow superimposed; we find in this sameset of cards a unicorn in the middle of the four of coins; the three of cupspresents the figure of Isis coming out of a vase, and out of the two other vasestwo ibises come out, one carrying a crown for the goddess, the other a lotusflower which he seems to offer her. The four aces contain the image of thehieratic and sacred serpent, and, in certain decks, in the middle of the four ofcoins, instead of a symbolic unicorn, we find the double triangle of Solomon.German Tarot decks are more altered, and we find little more than the numbers ofthe keys overloaded with bizarre or absurd figures. We have in our possession aChinese Tarot, and there is to be found in the Imperial Library several samplesfrom a similar deck. Paul Boiteau, in his remarkable book on playing cards,542[9781101992746_EPUB-52__7.xhtml] provided several very well-made specimens ofsuch a deck. The Chinese Tarot conserves several other primordial emblems, wecan clearly distinguish the coins and the swords, but it is more difficult tofind the cups and wands in them.It was in the time of the Gnostic and Manichaean heresies that the Tarot musthave become lost to the Church, and it is in that same era that the meaning ofthe Book of Revelation was also lost. It was no longer understood that the sevenseals of this Cabalistic book are the seven pentacles whose figure we provide,and that they are explained by the analogy of the numbers of the characters andthe figures of the Tarot. Thus the universal tradition of the unique religionwas momentarily interrupted, the shadows of doubt were spread all over theearth, it resembled ignorance rather than true Catholicism, and the universalrevelation had disappeared for a time. The explication of the book of Saint Johnthrough the characters of the Cabala will be a new revelation, which has alreadybeen foreseen by several distinguished mages. Here is how one among them, AgostiXaho,543 [9781101992746_EPUB-52__8.xhtml] expresses himself:The poem of Revelation supposes of the young evangelist a complete system oftraditions developed by him alone.It is written in the form of visions, and compresses into the dazzling frame ofpoetry all of the erudition, all of the philosophy of the civilizing African.An inspired bard, the author skims through a series of primary facts; hedescribes in general terms the history of society from one cataclysm to anotherand even beyond.The truths which he reveals are prophecies come from on high and afar, of whichhe sounds the echo.He is the voice which cries out, the voice which sings the harmonies of thedesert and prepares the paths towards the light.His words explode with influence and command our faith, because he had justbrought to the barbarians the oracles of Lao and revealed for the admiration offuture civilizations the firstborn of the suns.The theory of the four ages544 [9781101992746_EPUB-52__9.xhtml] is found inRevelation as it is found in the books of Zoroaster and the Bible.The gradual reestablishment of the primordial federations and the reign of Godamong the peoples, free of the tyrants’ yoke and the blindfold of error, isclearly prophesied for the end of the fourth age and the renovation of thecataclysm described, first in the distant future, with the consummation of time.The description of the cataclysm and its duration; the new world, having beencleared of the waves and appearing under the sky with all its charms; the greatserpent, tied by an angel to the bottom of the well of the abyss for a time; thedawn at long last of the time to come as prophesied by the Verb, which appearsto the apostle right at the start of his poem:“His head and his hair were white, his eyes sparkled, his feet seemed of finebronze when still in the furnace, his voice equaled the noise of great waters.“He held seven stars in his right hand, and from his mouth arose a wellsharpened double-edged glaive. His visage was as bright as the sun in fullforce.[image/Doctrine_Magic_38.jpg]APOCALYPTIC KEY: THE SEVEN SEALS OF SAINT JOHN.“Here is Ormuzd, Osiris, Surya,545 [9781101992746_EPUB-52_10.xhtml] the lamb,the Christ, the Ancient of Days, the man of time and the river as sung byDaniel.“He is the first and the last, he who was and who must be, the alpha and theomega, the beginning and the end.“He holds in his hand the key to the mysteries; he opens the great abyss of thecentral fire where death rests under a tent of darkness, where the great serpentsleeps while waiting for the awakening of the centuries.”The author draws together Saint John’s allegory with that of Daniel’s, where thefour forms of the sphinx are applied to the great periods of history, and wherethe man-sun, the Verb of light, consoles and instructs the seer.The prophet Daniel saw a sea agitated in the contrary direction by the fourwinds of heaven.And the beasts all very different from one another arose from the depths of theOcean.The empire of everything on earth was accorded to them until an age, two agesand half of the fourth age.And there arose four.The first beast, symbol of the solar race of the seers, came from Africa; itresembled a lion and had eagle’s wings: it was given a human heart.The second beast, emblem of the conquerors of the north who regenerates throughiron during the second age, resembled a bear.It had in its jaws three rows of sharp teeth, symbol of the three greatconquering families, and it was told: Arise and satiate yourself with carnage.After the apparition of the fourth beast, the thrones were raised, and theancient of days, the Christ of the seers, the lamb of the first age, appearsseated.His clothing was of a blinding whiteness, his head radiated; his throne, fromwhich lively flames spouted out, was carried by burning wheels; a very livelyflame arose from his visage, and a myriad angels or stars shone about him.The judgment rung out; the allegorical books were opened.The new Christ arrived in a multitude of lightning and stopped before theancient of days; he gained a share of power, honor, and the reign over all thepeoples, all the tribes, all the languages.Daniel then approached one of those who were present and asked him for the truthof things.And he is answered that the four animals are the four powers which reignsuccessively over the earth.Mr. Xaho then explains several images whose analogies are striking, and whichare found in almost all the sacred books. His words are highly noteworthy.In all primordial verbs, the parallels between physical relationships and moralrelations are established along the same radical lines.Each word carries with it its material and perceptible definition, and thisliving language is so perfect and true that it is simple and natural forcreative man.The seer expresses with the same word, slightly modified, the sun, day, light,truth, and when applying the same epithet to the white sun and the lamb, he sayslamb or Christ instead of sun, and sun instead of truth, light, civilization,there is no allegory, but true relationships, grasped and expressed withinspiration.But when the children of the night say in their barbarous and incoherentdialect, sun, day, light, truth, lamb, the wise relationship so clearlyexpressed by the primordial Verb is erased and disappears, and through simpletranslation, the lamb and the sun become allegorical beings, become symbols.Note that, in effect, the word allegory itself signifies in its Celticdefinition change of discourse, translation.The observation which we have just made rigorously applies to all thecosmogonical language of the barbarians.The seers made use of the same inspired radicals to express food andinstruction. Is not the science of truth the food of the soul!Thus, the papyrus scroll or the biblos devoured by the prophet Ezekiel;546[9781101992746_EPUB-52_12.xhtml] the little book which an angel has the authorof the Book of Revelation eat;547 [9781101992746_EPUB-52_13.xhtml] the feasts inthe magical palace of Asgard to which Gangleri is invited by Har the Sublime;548[9781101992746_EPUB-52_14.xhtml] the miraculous multiplication of the sevenloaves, as recounted by the evangelists of the Nazarene;549[9781101992746_EPUB-52_15.xhtml] the living bread which Sun-Jesus has hisdisciples eat, while saying to them, “This is my body;”550[9781101992746_EPUB-52_16.xhtml] and the masses of other similar lines are therepetition of the same allegory: the lives of souls, which are nourished by thetruth; the truth, which multiplies itself, without ever diminishing and, to thecontrary, augments as we eat it.That exalted by a noble sentiment of nationalism, blinded by the idea of animmense revolution, there arises a revealer of hidden things, and he looks topopularize the discoveries of the ancient science among crude men, ignorant,stripped of the most simple and elementary notions.That he says, for example: The Earth turns, the Earth is as round as an egg.What can the barbarian who listens do, if not believe! Is it not evident thatany proposition of this type becomes for him a doctrine from on high, an articleof faith?And does not the veil of a wise allegory suffice to make a myth?In the schools of seers the terrestrial globe was represented by an egg of paperor of painted wood, and when they asked little children: What is this egg? Andthey responded: It is the Earth.As big children, the barbarians having heard this, repeated after the childrenof the seers: The world is an egg.But they understood by that the physical world, the material world, and theseers had meant the geographical world, the ideal world, the world image,created by the spirit and the Verb.Thus the priests of Egypt represented the spirit, intelligence, Kneph, with anegg laying on lips, to better express that the egg was only a comparison, animage, a manner of speaking.Shumontou, the philosopher of the Ezourvedam, explains to the fanatic Biache inthe same manner what one must understand by the golden egg of Brahma.551[9781101992746_EPUB-52_17.xhtml]One must not completely lose hope for an epoch in which we are again occupiedwith serious and reasonable research: it is also with great relief and profoundsympathy that we have just quoted from the pages of M. Xaho. This here is nolonger the negative and despairing critique of Dupuis and of Volney. It is atendency towards a single faith, towards a single cult which must link all thefuture to all of the past; it is the rehabilitation of all the great men falselyaccused of superstition and idolatry; lastly it is the justification of Godhimself, that sun of intelligences who is never veiled to upright souls and purehearts.“He is great, the seer, the initiate, the elect of nature and of supremereason,” cries out still the author we have just quoted in conclusion.“To him alone that faculty of imitation which is the principle of his advancetowards perfection and whose inspirations, quick as lightning, direct hiscreations and discoveries.“To him alone a Verb of perfect convenience, of propriety, of flexibility, ofwealth, the harmony of thought created by physical reaction; of thought whoseinsights, still independent of language, always reflect the nature exactlyreproduced by its impressions, well judged, and well expressed through theirconnections.“To him alone the light, the science, the truth, because imagination, bounded inits secondary, passive role, never dominates reason, the natural logic whichresults from the comparison of ideas, which are born, and extend out in the sameproportion as his needs, and whose circle of knowledge thus widens by degreeswithout a confusion of false judgments and errors.“To him alone an infinitely progressive light, because the rapid multiplicationof the population, after the terrestrial renovations, combined in just a fewcenturies a new society with all the possible connections of its destiny, eithermoral or political.“And we could add, absolute light.“The man of our times is immutable by nature; he changes no more than the natureby which he is organized.“The social conditions in which he finds himself placed, alone determine thedegree of his perfectionment, which has as its limits virtue, the holiness ofman and his happiness within the law.”Will people still ask us after such insights what use are the occult sciences?Will they treat with disdain these living mathematics called mysticism andilluminism, these dimensions of ideas and of forms, this permanent revelationwithin universal reason, this liberation of the spirit, this unshakablefoundation given to faith, this omnipotence revealed to the will? Children insearch of magic tricks, are you disappointed because we give you miracles! A mansaid to us one day: “Make the devil appear, and I will believe you.” Weanswered, “You ask for very little; we would prefer, instead of making the devilto appear, but to disappear from the entire world; we wish to chase him fromyour dreams! The devil is ignorance, it is darkness, it is incoherent thought,it is ugliness! Awake, dreamer of the Middle Ages! Do you not see that it isday? Do you not see the light of God which fills all of nature? Where then wouldthe fallen prince of the hells dare show himself now?”[image/space_break_orn_converted.jpg]It remains for us to provide our conclusions and to determine the goal and theextent of this work in the religious domain, the philosophical domain and in thedomain of positive and material realizations.In the religious domain, first of all, we have demonstrated that culticpractices are by no means of indifferent value, that the magic of religions isin their rites, that their moral force is in the ternary hierarchy, and that thehierarchy has unity as its foundation, principle, and synthesis.We have demonstrated that the unity and the universal orthodoxy of the doctrinewas successively dressed up in several allegorical veils, and we have followedthe truth saved by Moses from the profanations of Egypt, conserved in the Cabalaof the prophets, emancipated by the Christian school from servitude to thePharisees, attracting to it all the poetic and generous aspirations of the Greekand Roman civilizations, and then protesting against a new Phariseeism even morecorrupt than the first, with the great saints of the Middle Ages and the boldthinkers of the Renaissance. We have shown, I say, that eternal universal truth,always one, always living, which alone conciliates reason with faith, sciencewith submission; the truth of being demonstrated by being, the truth of harmonydemonstrated by harmony, the truth of reason manifested by reason.By revealing to the world for the first time the mysteries of magic, we did notwish to resuscitate those practices buried under the ruins of ancientcivilizations, but we say to the humanity of today that it is also called tomake itself immortal and omnipotent by its works.Liberty is not given, it is taken, said a modern writer;552[9781101992746_EPUB-52_18.xhtml] the same is true for science, and it is forthis reason that the divulging of the absolute truth is never useful for thevulgar. But in an era where the sanctuary has been devastated and has falleninto ruins, because we had thrown the key across the fields to no one’s profit,I believed it my duty to pick up that key, and I offer it to he who will knowhow to take it: because that person will in his turn be a doctor of nations anda liberator of the world.We need and we will always need fables and toys for children; but it must not bethe case that those who hold up the toys are also children and listeners tofables.May the most absolute science, may the most highest reason again become theallotment of the leaders of the people; may the sacerdotal and royal art againtake up the double scepter of the ancient initiations, and the world will ariseonce again from chaos.Let us stop burning the holy images, let us stop demolishing the temples: manneeds temples and images; but let us chase off the merchants from the house ofprayers; let us stop allowing the blind to lead the blind; let us reconstitutethe hierarchy of intelligence and holiness, and let us only recognize those whoknow as the doctors for those who believe.Our book is Catholic; and if the revelations it contains are of a nature whichalarms the conscience of simpletons, our consolation is to think that they willnot read it. We write for men without prejudices, and we do not want to flatterirreligiousness any more than fanaticism.But if there is something in this world which is essentially free andinviolable, it is belief. We must, through science and through persuasion, turnimaginations lead astray away from the absurd; but to threaten or constrain themwould be to provide their errors with all the dignity and truth of a martyr.Faith is but superstition and folly if it does not have reason as its base, andwe can only suppose what we do not know through analogy with what we do know. Todefine what we do not know is presumptuous ignorance; to positively affirm whatwe do not know is to lie.Faith is also an aspiration and a desire. So be it, I desire it to be so, suchis the last word of all professions of faith. Faith, hope, and charity are threesisters who are so inseparable that we can take one for the other.Thus in religion, the universal and hierarchical orthodoxy, the restoration ofthe temples in all their splendor, the reestablishment of all the ceremonies intheir primordial glory, the hierarchic teaching of symbols, mysteries, miracles,legends for children, light for mature men who will take care not to scandalizethe little ones in their simplicity and their beliefs. There is the religion ofour utopia, and it is also the desire and the need of humanity.Let us come to philosophy.Ours is that of realism and positivism.Being is due to the being which no one doubts. All exists for us throughscience. To know is to be. Science and its object are identified in theintellectual life of he who knows. To doubt is to be ignorant. Yet that which wedo not know exists does not yet exist for us. To live intellectually is tolearn.Existence develops and is amplified by science. The first conquest of science isthe first results of the exact sciences, it is the opinion of reason. The lawsof nature are algebraic. The only reasonable faith is the student’s provisionalacceptance of theorems: he does not ask about their correctness in and ofthemselves but whether their applications and their results have beensufficiently demonstrated to him. Thus the true philosopher believes in what isand only accepts a posteriori that all is reasonable.But no more charlatanism in philosophy, no more empiricism, no more systems;just the study of existence and its comparative realities! A metaphysics ofnature! Then away with mysticism! No more dreams in philosophy: philosophy isnot a poem; it is the pure mathematics of the realities, either physical ormoral. Let us leave to religion the freedom of infinite aspirations, but letreligion leave science its rigorous conclusions of absolute experimentalism.Man is the son of his works: he is what he wants to be, he is the image of Godwho makes himself; he is the realization of his ideal. If his ideal lacks afoundation, the entire edifice of his immortality collapses. Philosophy is notthe ideal, but it must serve as a foundation for the ideal. The known for us isthe measure of the unknown; the visible allows us to appreciate the invisible,sensations are to thoughts what thoughts are to aspirations. Science is acelestial trigonometry: one of the sides of the absolute triangle is naturesubmitted to our investigations; the other side is our soul, which embraces andreflects nature; the third side is the absolute within which our soul grows!Atheism is no longer possible, because we no longer have the arrogance to defineGod. God is for us the most perfect and the best of intelligent beings, and theascending hierarchy of being demonstrates well enough that he exists. Let us notask for more; but, to understand him better and better, shall we not perfectourselves by climbing towards him?No more ideology; existence is what it is and is only perfected by following thereal laws of being. Let us observe, not prejudge; let us exert out faculties,not falsify them; let us expand the domain of life in life; let us see truth inthe truth! All is possible for he who only wants what is true. Remain withinnature, study, know, then dare; dare to want, dare to act, and remain silent!No more hatred directed at anybody. Each will reap what he sows. The result ofwork is fate, and that is the supreme reason for judging and punishing thewicked. He who goes down a dead-end road will backtrack or will be broken. Warnhim kindly, if he can still hear you; then leave him to it: human freedom mustrun its course.We are not set to judge each other. Life is a battlefield. Let us not stopfighting because of those who fall, but let us avoid stepping on them. Thencomes victory, and the wounded of both parties, having become brothers throughsuffering and before humanity, shall be reunited in the ambulances of thevictors.Such are the consequences of the philosophical doctrine of Hermes; such was thephilosophy of the Rosicrucians, inheritors of all the ancient wisdom; such isthe secret doctrine of those associations which were treated as dangerous to thepublic order and which have always been accused of conspiring against thronesand altars!The true adept, far from troubling the public order, is its firmest support, herespects liberty too much to desire anarchy; child of the light, he lovesharmony, and he knows that the shadows produce confusion. He accepts all that isand denies only what is not. He wants the true religion, practical, universal,believing, palpable, realized throughout his entire life; he wants it to have awise and powerful priesthood, surrounded by all the virtues and all the glamourof faith. He wants universal orthodoxy, absolute Catholicism, hierarchical,apostolic, sacramental, incontestable, and uncontested. He wants an experimentalphilosophy, real, mathematical, modest in its conclusions, indefatigable in itsresearches, scientific in its progress. Who then could be against us if God andreason are with us? What does it matter if they prejudge us and they slander us?Our entire justification is our thoughts and our works. We do not come, likeOedipus, to kill the sphinx of symbolism; we undertake, to the contrary, toresuscitate it. The sphinx only devours blind interpreters, and he who killed itdid not know how to divine it well: one must tame it, enchain it, and force itto follow. The sphinx is the living palladium of humanity, it is the conquest ofthe king of Thebes; it would have been Oedipus’s salvation if Oedipus hadguessed its enigma entirely!In the positive and material domain, what must one conclude of this work? Ismagic a force which science can abandon to the most audacious and the mostwicked? Is it the trickery and lies of the most clever used to fascinate theignorant and the weak? Is the philosopher’s mercury the exploitation of thecredulous through misdirection? Those who have understood us know already how torespond to these questions. Magic can no longer in our day be the art offascination and illusions: one now only fools those who wished to be fooled. Butthe narrow and reckless incredulity of the previous century is refuted by natureitself. We live surrounded by prophecies and miracles; in the past, doubt deniedthem recklessly; the science of today explains them. No, monsieur Comte deMirville, it is not given to a fallen spirit to trouble the empire of God! No,unknown things are not explained by impossibilities; no, it is not at all givento invisible beings the ability to fool, to torment, to seduce, to even kill theliving creatures of God, men, already so ignorant and so weak, and who have somuch difficulty defending themselves from their own illusions. Those who toldyou as much in your childhood have fooled you, monsieur Count, and if you werechildish enough to listen to them, be man enough now to no longer believe them.Man is himself the creator of his heaven and his hell, and there are no otherdemons than those of madness. The spirits that truth punishes are correctedthrough punishment and no longer imagine troubling this world. If Satan exists,he can only be the most unhappy, the most ignorant, the most humiliated, and themost impotent of beings.The existence of a universal agent of life, of a living fire, of an astral lighthas been demonstrated to us through facts. Magnetism allows us to understandtoday the miracles of ancient magic: the occurrences of second sight,aspirations, sudden healings, penetrations of thought are now things which arerecognized and familiar, even to our children. But we have lost the ancienttraditions, we thought they were new discoveries; we searched for the latestword regarding the observed phenomena, heads have been troubled bymanifestations without apparent cause, we were subjected to fascinations withoutunderstanding them. We have come to say to the table turners: These illusionsare not new; you can operate even greater ones if you study the secret laws ofnature. And what will be the result of the renewed knowledge of these powers? Anew pathway opened to the activity and the intelligence of man, the combat oflife organized anew with the most perfect weapons, and the possibility renderedunto elite intelligences to again become masters of all the destinies byproviding the world to come with true priests and great kings!END OF THE RITUAL"},{"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENT TO THE RITUALTHE NUCTEMERON OF APOLLONIUS OF TYANAPublished in Greek, based on an ancient manuscript, by Gilbert Gaulminus in Devita et morte Moysis, book III, page 206; reproduced by Laurent Moshemius in hissacred observations and historical criticisms, Amsterdam, 1721; translated andexplained for the first time, by Eliphas Lévi.553[9781101992746_EPUB-53_fn.xhtml]Nuctemeron means day and night or the night illuminated by the day.554[9781101992746_EPUB-53_11.xhtml] It is a title which is analogous to that ofLight Arising from Darkness, a relatively well-known hermetic work;555[9781101992746_EPUB-53_22.xhtml] we could also translate it in this way:The Light of OccultismThis monument to the high magic of the Assyrians556[9781101992746_EPUB-53_33.xhtml] is interesting enough for us to have taken thetrouble to have its importance noticed. We not only evoked Apollonius, we haveperhaps managed to resuscitate him.557 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_34.xhtml]The NuctemeronFIRST HOUR.I. Ἐν ᾗ δαίμονες ἀνοῦντες (lege ὑμνοῦντες vel αἰνοῦντες) τὸν θεὸν, οὔτεἀδικοῦσιν, οὔτε κολάζουσιν. (In which demons, praising God, neither injure norpunish.)558 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_35.xhtml]In the unity, the demons sing the praises of God, they shed their wickedness andtheir anger.SECOND HOUR.II. Ἐν ᾗ αἰνοῦσιν οἱ ἰχθύεςτὸν θεὸν, καὶ τὸ τοῦ πυρὸς βάθος. Ἐν ᾗ οφείλειστοιχειοῦσθαι ἀποτελέσματα εἰς δράκοντας καὶ πῦρ. (In which the fishes praiseGod, and the depth of fire. In which one ought to deploy talismans againstdragons and fire.)Through the binary, the fish of the Zodiac sing the praises of God, the serpentsof fire intertwine themselves around the caduceus, and the lightning becomesharmonious.THIRD HOUR.III. Ἐν ᾗ αἰνοῦσιν ὄφεις καὶ κύνες καὶ πῦρ. (In which snakes and dogs and firepraise [God].)The serpents of Hermes’s caduceus intertwine themselves three times, Cerberusopens his triple mouth, and the fire sings the praises of God with three tonguesof lightning.FOURTH HOUR.IV. Ἐν ᾗ διέρχονται δαίμονες ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος ὁ ἐκεῖσεβλαβήσεται, καὶ φόβον καὶ φρίκην ἐκ τῆς δαιμόνων λήψεται φαντασίας. Ἐν ᾗ ὀφείλειἐνεργεῖν ἐπὶ μαγικοῦ καὶ παντὸς γοητικοῦ πράγματος. (In which demons go aboutinside the tombs, and a [demon] that comes from there will injure one, and hewill take fear and shuddering from the fantasy of demons. In [this hour] oneought to work on every deed of magic and sorcery.)In the fourth hour the soul returns to visit the tombs, it is the moment whenthe magic lamps at the four corners of the circles are lit, it is the hour ofenchantments and illusions.FIFTH HOUR.V. Ἐν ᾗ αἰνοῦσιν τὰ ἄνω ὕδατα τὸν θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.559[9781101992746_EPUB-53_36.xhtml] (In which the waters on high praise the God ofheaven.)The voices of the great waters sing out to the God of the celestial spheres.SIXTH HOUR.VI. Ὅτε δέον ἡσυχάζειν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθαι, διότι ἔχει φόβον. (When it is right tobe silent and take one’s rest, lest one take fright.)The spirit remains immobile, it sees the infernal monsters marching against it,and it is without fear.SEVENTH HOUR.VII. Ἐν ᾗ ἀναπαύσει πάντα τὰ ζῶα. Καὶ ἐάν τις καθαρὸς ἄνθροπος ἁρπάσῃ καὶ βάλλῃαὐτὸ ὁ ἰερεὺς, καὶ μίξει ἐλαίῳ καὶἁγιάσῃ αὐτὸ καὶ ἀλείψῃ ἀπ᾽αὐτοῦ ἀσθενῆ,παρευθὺ τῆς νόσου ἀπαλλαγήσεται. (In which all animals take their rest. And ifany pure person seizes up, and the priest throws it down, and mixes it with oil,and hallows it, and anoints his weaknesses from him, he will be delivered atonce from his illness.)A fire which gives life to all animated beings is directed by the will of puremen. The initiate extends his hand and the sufferings subside.EIGHTH HOUR.VIII. Ἐν ᾗ ἀποτέλεσμα στοιχείων καὶ παντοίον φυτῶν.

Ἐν ᾗ ἀναπαύονται τὰ πύρινα τάγματα. (In which the fiery ranks [ofcreatures] take their rest.)Here the works of the eternal light are accomplished through fire.EXPLICATION.These twelve symbolic hours, analogous to the signs of the magical Zodiac and tothe allegorical trials of Hercules, represent the series of works towardsinitiation.Thus one must start by:First, taming wicked passions and strength, using the expression of the wiseHierophant, to make the demons themselves praise God.Second, studying the balanced forces of nature so as to know how harmony resultsfrom the analogy of opposites. To recognize the great magical agent and thedouble polarization of the universal light.Third, becoming initiated into the symbolism of the ternary, the principle ofall theogonies and of all religious symbols.Fourth, knowing how to dominate all the phantoms of the imagination and triumphover all illusions.Fifth, understanding how the universal harmony is produced in the center of thefour elementary forces.Sixth, becoming inaccessible to fear.Seventh, acting in the direction of the magnetic light.Eighth, learning to predict effects by the calculation of the weighting ofcauses.Ninth, understanding the hierarchy of teachings, respecting the mysteries of thedoctrine, and remaining silent before the profane.Tenth, studying astronomy fully.Eleventh, becoming initiated through analogy with the laws of life and ofuniversal intelligence.Twelfth, operating great works of nature with the guidance of the light.Here now are the names and the attributions of the spirits which preside overthe twelve hours of the Nuctemeron.By these spirits the ancient hierophants meant neither gods nor angels nordemons, but moral forces or personified virtues.SPIRITS OF THE FIRST HOUR.PAPUS, doctor.SINBUCK, judge.RASPHUIA, necromancer.ZABUN, spirit of scandal.HEIGLOT, spirit of the snows.MIZKUN, spirit of amulets.HAVEN, spirit of dignity.EXPLICATION.One must become one’s own doctor and judge in order to vanquish the evil spellsof the necromancer.

The Arabs still say that the Shamir, given in primordialtimes to Adam, and lost by him after his fall, was rediscovered by Enoch andpossessed by Zoroaster, that Solomon received it next from an angel when he hadasked God for wisdom.

The great lawsof equilibrium and of luminous movement represented by the four symbolic animalsin the Cabala and in the mythology of the Greeks by the four horses of the Sun.The key to the emancipation of the bodies and the souls which opens all theprisons and that force of eternal choice which completes the creation of man andfixes him in immortality.SPIRITS OF THE TENTH HOUR.SEZARBIL, devil or enemy spirit.AZEUPH, killer of children.ARMILUS, spirit of cupidity.KATARIS, spirit of dogs or the profane.RAZANIL, spirit of the onyx stone.BUCHAPHI, spirit of the stryges.MASTHO, spirit of vain appearances.EXPLICATION.The numbers end with nine, and the distinctive sign of ten is the zero, withoutany value of its own, added to the unity. The spirits of the tenth hour thusrepresent all which, being nothing on their own, receive great power fromopinion and can in consequence set back the omnipotence of the sage. We walkhere upon burning ground, and you will allow me to not explain it to the profanenor the devil who is their master, nor the killer of children who is their love,nor to cupidity who is their god, nor to the dogs to whom we compare them, norto the stone of onyx which escapes them, nor to the stryges who are theircourtesans, nor the false appearances which they take for reality.SPIRITS OF THE ELEVENTH HOUR.AEGLUN, spirit of lightning.ZUPHLAS, spirit of forests.PHALDOR, spirit of oracles.ROSABIS, spirit of metals.ADJUGHAS, spirit of rocks.ZOPHAZ, spirit of pentacles.HALACHO, spirit of sympathies.EXPLICATION.Lightning obeys man, it becomes the vehicle of his will, the instrument of hisforce, the light of his torches, the oaks of the sacred forests which renderoracles, the metals are transformed and change into gold, or become talismans,the rocks are detached from their base and, carried away by the lyre of thegrand hierophant, touched by the mysterious schamir, they change into templesand palaces, the doctrines are formulated, the symbols represented by thepentacles become effective, the spirits are enchained by powerful sympathies andobey the laws of family and friendship.SPIRITS OF THE TWELFTH HOUR.TARAB, spirit of corruption.MISRAN, spirit of persecution.LABUS, spirit of the inquisition.KALAB, spirit of sacred vases.HAHAB, spirit of the royal tables.MARNES, spirit of the discernment of spirits.SELLEN, spirit of the favors of the great.EXPLICATION.Here is the fate which mages must expect and the way in which their sacrificewill be consummated because after the conquest of life, one must know how tosacrifice oneself to be reborn immortal. They will suffer corruption; theirgold, their pleasure, and vengeance will be demanded of them, and, if they donot satisfy the cupidity of the vulgar, they will be exposed to persecution, tothe inquisition; but one does not profane the sacred vases, they are made forthe royal tables, that is to say for the banquets of intelligence. Through thediscernment of spirits, they will know how to keep the favors of the great andwill remain invincible in their force and in their liberty.THE NUCTEMERONAccording to the Hebrews561 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_38.xhtml]The Nuctemeron of Apollonius, borrowed from Greek theurgy, completed andexplained by the Assyrian hierarchy of angels, corresponds perfectly with thephilosophy of numbers as we find it presented in the most curious pages of theancient Talmud.Thus the Pythagorean traditions rise higher than Pythagoras, thus Genesis is amagnificent allegory, which in the form of a story hides the secrets, not onlyof the past accomplishment of creation, but of permanent and universal creation,of the eternal generation of beings.Here is what we read in the Talmud:“God stretched the sky out like a tabernacle, he dressed the world like a richlyserved table, and he created man as though he were inviting a guest.”Listen to what King Shlomo562 [9781101992746_EPUB-53__1.xhtml] says:“The divine Chokmah, wisdom, the wife of God, built herself a house, she carvedseven columns.“She immolated her victims.“She mixed her wine, she dressed the table, and she sent for her servants.”This wisdom who establishes her house according to regular and numericalarchitecture is the exact science which presides over the works of God.It is her compass and her set square. The seven columns are the sevendistinctive and primordial days.The victims are the natural forces which fertilize themselves which results in asort of death.The mixed wine is the universal fluid, the table is the world with its seasfilled with fish.The servants of Chokmah are the souls of Adam and Chavah (Eve).The earth from which Adam was formed was taken from the entire mass of theworld.His head is Israel, his body is the empire of Babylon and his members are theother nations of the Earth.(Here are revealed the hopes of the initiates of Moses for the constitution of auniversal Oriental kingdom.)Yet there are twelve hours in the day in which man’s creation was accomplished.FIRST HOUR.God reunites the scattered fragments of the Earth, and he kneads them together,from it he forms a single mass which he wishes to animate.EXPLICATION.Man is the synthesis of the created world, in him the creative unity begins, heis made in the image and the resemblance of God.SECOND HOUR.God roughs out the form of the body, he separates it in two so that the organsare dual, because all force and all life results from two, and it is thus thatthe Elohim had made all things.EXPLICATION.Everything lives through movement, everything maintains itself throughequilibrium, and harmony results from the analogy of opposites; this law is theform of forms, it is the first manifestation of the activity and the fecundityof God.THIRD HOUR.The members of man, obeying the law of life, reproduce from themselves and arecompleted by the generative organ, which is composed of one and of two, symbolof the ternary number.EXPLICATION.The ternary comes of itself from the binary; the movement which produces two,produces three; three is the key to all numbers, because it is the first numeralsynthesis, its geometry is the triangle, the first complete and enclosed figure,generator of an infinity of triangles, either dissimilar or the same.FOURTH HOUR.God blows on the face of man and gives him a soul.EXPLICATION.The quaternary which in geometry is the cross and the square is the perfectnumber and it is in the perfection of form that the intelligent soul manifestsitself, according to this revelation of the Mishnah, the child will only beanimated in the womb of the mother after the form completes all its members.FIFTH HOUR.Man stands on his feet, he detaches himself from the earth, he walks, he goeswhere he wishes.EXPLICATION.The number five is that of the soul symbolized by the quintessence which resultsfrom the equilibrium of the four elements, in the Tarot this number issymbolized by the grand-priest or the spiritual autocrat, symbol of the humanwill, that grand-priest who alone decides our eternal destinies.SIXTH HOUR.The animals pass before Adam and he gives each of them a name of his choosing.EXPLICATION.Through work, man subdues the earth and tames the animals; by manifesting hisliberty, he produces his Verb, or Word, and creation obeys him; here primordialcreation is completed. God created man on the sixth day, but on the sixth hourof that day, man finishes the work of God and creates himself anew in a way,since he makes himself the king of nature, which he subjects to his word.SEVENTH HOUR.God gives Adam a companion taken from the substance of man itself.EXPLICATION.God, after having created man in his image, rested on the seventh day, becausehe gave himself a fertile wife who would work ceaselessly for him; nature is thewife of God, and God rests on her. Man, having become a creator in his turnthrough the Verb, provides himself with a companion similar to himself and uponwhose love he can now rest; woman is the work of man, it is he, who in lovingher, renders her beautiful, it is he who makes her a mother; woman is theveritable daughter of human nature and mother of man, granddaughter and littlemother563 [9781101992746_EPUB-53__2.xhtml] of God.EIGHTH HOUR.Adam and Eve get into the nuptial bed, they are two when they lie down and whenthey arise, they are four.EXPLICATION.The quaternary joined to the quaternary represents form balancing form, creationcoming from creation, the eternal balance of life, seven being the number ofGod’s rest, the unity which comes after represents man who works and cooperateswith nature for the work of creation.NINTH HOUR.God imposes his law upon man.EXPLICATION.Nine is the number of initiation because, being composed of three times three,it represents the divine idea and the absolute philosophy of numbers, that iswhy Apollonius says that the mystery of the number nine must not be revealed.TENTH HOUR.In the tenth hour Adam falls into sin.EXPLICATION.According to the Cabalists, ten is the number of matter whose special sign isthe zero, in the tree of the sephiroth, ten represents Malkhut or the exteriorand material substance; Adam’s sin is thus materialism and the fruit which hepicks from the tree represents the flesh isolated from the spirit, the zeroseparated from its unity, the splitting of the number ten, which gives on oneside the dispossessed unity and on the other the void or death.ELEVENTH HOUR.On the eleventh hour the guilty one is condemned to work and must expiate hissin by submitting to suffering.EXPLICATION.In the Tarot eleven represents strength, yet strength is acquired throughordeals; God gives man suffering as the means for his salvation, one must thusstruggle and suffer to conquer intelligence and life.TWELFTH HOUR.Man and woman submit to their suffering, the expiation begins, and the liberatoris promised.EXPLICATION.Such is the complement to the birth of morality, man is complete, because he isfated for the sacrifice which regenerates him. Adam’s exile is similar toOedipus’s exile; like Oedipus, Adam is the father of two enemies; Oedipus has asa daughter the pious and virginal Antigone,564 [9781101992746_EPUB-53__3.xhtml]and the race of Adam gives rise to Mary.These mysterious and divine revelations of the religious unity in the ancientmysteries is found, as we have said, in the Talmud, but without having recourseto this voluminous compilation, we can also find them in Paolo Riccio’scommentary on the Talmudists which has as its title Epitome de talmudicaDoctrina, p. 280 of tome I from the collection of the Cabalists by Pistorius.565[9781101992746_EPUB-53__4.xhtml]OF COUNTRY MAGIC AND THE SORCERY OF SHEPHERDSIn his solitude, in the middle of his work with vegetation, the instinctive andmagnetic forces of man are augmented and are exalted, the powerful emanations ofsap, the odor of hay, the aromas of certain flowers fill the air with euphoriaand vertigo; and then impressionable people easily fall into a sort of ecstasywhich makes them dream while awake. It is then that the nocturnal washerwomen566[9781101992746_EPUB-53__5.xhtml] appear, the werewolves, the imps who flingriders from their mounts and climb up on horses, whipping them with their longtails. These visions of men while still awake are real and frightful, and oneshould not laugh at our old Breton farmers when they recount what they haveseen.These passing intoxications, when they are multiplied and prolonged, communicatean impressionability and particular sensibility to the nervous system, peoplebecome waking somnambulists, the senses acquire a keenness which is sometimesmiraculous and even incredible; they hear revealing sounds at tremendousdistances, they see the thoughts of men on their faces, they are suddenly struckby presentiments of misfortune which threaten them.Nervous children, idiots, old women, and in general all instinctive or unwillingcelibates are the most susceptible to this type of magnetism; and it is thusthat those pathological phenomena which we regard as the mysterious powers ofthe medium are produced and develop complications. Around these unruly souls,magnetic whirlpools are formed and wonders often occur, wonders analogous tothose of electricity, the attraction and repulsion of inert objects, atmosphericcurrents, highly pronounced sympathetic or antipathetic influences. The humanmagnet acts at great distances and upon all bodies, with the exception of woodcharcoal, which absorbs and neutralizes the terrestrial astral light in all itstransformations.If these natural accidents merge with a perverse will, this sick person canbecome a great danger to his neighbors, especially if his organism hasexclusively absorbent properties. It is in this manner that enchantments andspells are explained; thence that strange ailment which the Romans called theevil eye and which is still feared in Naples under the name of Jettatura becomesadmissible and can be submitted to medical diagnostics.In our Key to the Great Mysteries567 [9781101992746_EPUB-53__6.xhtml] we havesaid why shepherds are more easily subject than others to these magneticderegulations; drivers of herds, whom they magnetize with their good or evilwill, are subject to influence from the animal souls which are united undertheir direction and which become like appendages of their will; their moralinfirmities produce physical maladies in their sheep, and they are subject inturn to the petulance of their billy goats and the caprices of their nannies; ifa shepherd has an absorbent nature, the flock becomes absorbent and sometimesfatally attracts to itself all the vigor and health of a neighboring flock. Itis thus that mortalities occur in the stables without anyone knowing why, andall precautions or remedies that are taken have no effect.This contagious sickness within flocks is sometimes determined by the enmity ofa rival shepherd who sneaked in during the night and buried a pact568[9781101992746_EPUB-53__7.xhtml] under the threshold of the stable. This willmake the incredulous smile, but this no longer has to do with credulity. Thatwhich superstition blindly believed in the past, science now observes andexplains.For it is certain and demonstrated by numerous experiments, first, that themagnetic influence of man directed by his will attaches itself to any objectchosen and influenced by that will.Second, that human magnetism acts at a distance and its power is centered uponmagnetized objects.Third, that the will to magnetize acquires even more power as it is multipliedby the expressive acts of that will.Fourth, that if these acts are of a nature which strongly impresses theimagination, if to accomplish them one had to surmount great exterior obstaclesand vanquish great interior resistances, the will becomes fixed, relentless, andinvincible like the will of madmen.Fifth, that men alone, due to their free will, can resist human will, but thatanimals do not resist for long.Let us now examine how rural sorcerers create their evil spells, veritable pactswith the spirit of perversity which serve as the fatal consecration of theirevil will.They form a composition of substances which cannot be procured without criminalacts or combined without sacrilege, they pronounce over these horrible mixtures,sometimes soaked with their own blood, formulas of execration, and they burythese signs of infernal hatred, which are irrevocably magnetized under the fieldor the door to the stable of their enemy.The effect is infallible; from that moment the flock begins to perish and theentire stable will soon be depopulated, unless the master of the stable opposesan energetic and victorious resistance towards the magnetism of his enemy.This resistance is easy when we make it using circles and currents, that is tosay through the association of wills and efforts. Contagion hardly ever affectsfarmers who know how to make themselves liked by their neighbors. Their goodsare thereby protected by everyone’s interest and the associated good wills soontriumph over an isolated malevolence.When an evil spell is thus cast off, it turns against its author, the malevolentmagnetizer suffers intolerable torments, which soon force him to destroy hisevil work and go back himself and disinter his pact.People in the Middle Ages also had recourse to conjurations and prayers, theyblessed the stables and the animals, they said mass as a means of repelling, bythe association of Christian wills in the faith and in prayer, the impiety ofthe enchanter.They aired the stables, they practiced fumigations, and they mixed magnetizedsalt into the animals’ feed with special exorcisms.At the end of our Key to the Great Mysteries we reproduced several of theseexorcisms, whose original text we had reestablished with particular attention.These formulas, copied and recopied by ignorant hands, thereafter senselesslyprinted by exploiters of popular credulity, did not come into our hands withoutstrange alterations.Here are a few of them as they are still found in the latest grimoires:Before all else, pronounce upon the salt: Panem coelestem accipiat sit nomenDomine invocabis.569 [9781101992746_EPUB-53__8.xhtml] Then take recourse in thecastle of Beauty and do the casting and the frictions while pronouncing thefollowing:“Eum ter ergo docentes omnes gentes baptizantes eos. In nomine atris, etc.”570[9781101992746_EPUB-53__9.xhtml]Protection against scabies. “When Our Lord rose up to heaven, he left his holyvirtue on earth. Pasle, Colet, and Hervé; all that which God said was said well.Beast of red, white, or black, of whatever color you are, if there are anyscabies or ringworms on you, even if they were placed and made nine feetunderground, it is just as true that they shall leave and die, just as SaintJohn was in the skin and was born of a camel; just as Saint Joseph Nicodemus ofArimathea brought down the body of my sweet Savior Redeemer Jesus Christ, fromthe tree of the cross, on the day of Good Friday.”“You shall use for the casting and the frictions the following words, and haverecourse to that which we said in the castle of Beauty:“Salt, I cast you with the hand that God gave me. Volo et vono Baptista SanctaAca latum est.”571 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_10.xhtml]Protection to stop wolves from entering the grounds where the sheep are. “Placeyourself in the corner of the rising sun, and pronounce five times that whichfollows. If you only wish to pronounce it once, you will do so five days in arow.“Come, beast of wool, this is the Lamb of humility, I protect you, Ave, Maria.This is the Lamb of the Redemptor who fasted for forty days without rebelling,without having taken any meal from the enemy, who was in truth tempted. Gostraight, gray beast, to the gray grasper; search out your prey, wolves andshe-wolves and wolf cubs; you shall not visit this meat which is here. In thename of the Father, the Son, and the Holy-Spirit, and the blessed saint Stag.Also vade retro, o Satana!”572 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_12.xhtml]Another protection. “Beast of wool, I take you in the name of God and the veryholy sacred Virgin Mary. I pray to God that the domain that I shall make takeson and profits from my will. I conjure you so that you will break and shatterany kinds of enchantments which may be passed under the body of my living flockof beasts of wool, who are here present before God and before myself; who areunder my care and my guard. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the HolySpirit and of M. Saint John the Baptist and M. Saint Abraham.”See above regarding what we have said for operating in the castle of Beauty, andyou shall use the casting and friction of the words which follow:“Pasqueflower, Jesus is resuscitated.”Protection against scabies, ringworm and sheep pox. “It was on a Monday morningthat the Savior of the world passed, the Holy Virgin after him, M. Saint Johnhis shepherd boy, his friend, who searches for his divine flock, which isbesotted with that malign sheep pox, with which he is fed up, because of thethree shepherds who came to adore my Savior Redemptor Jesus Christ in Bethlehem,and who adored the voice of the child.” Say the Our Father five times and theAve Maria five times.“My flock, who are subject to me, shall be healthy and beautiful. I pray to MmeSaint Genevieve that she may serve me as my friend with regard to this malignsheep pox here. Sheep pox banished by God, renounced by Jesus Christ, I commandyou, on behalf of the great God, that you leave from here, and that you go anddissolve and be confounded before God and before me, as does the dew before thesun. By the so glorious Virgin Mary and Holy Spirit, sheep pox, leave from here,because God commands you, as true as Joseph Nicodemus of Arimathea had descendedthe precious body of my Savior and Redemptor Jesus Christ, the day of GoodFriday, from the tree of the cross: by the Father, by the Son, and by the HolySpirit, worthy flock of beasts of wool, approach here, to God and to me. Here isthe divine offering of salt which I present to you today; since without the saltnothing was done and with the salt everything was done, as I believe, by theFather, etc.“O salt! I conjure you, on behalf of the great living God, that you may serve asI say, that you may protect and guard my flock from ringworm, scabies, dyspnea,from the lesser dyspnea, from poisoned pellets and from contaminated water. Icommand you, as Jesus Christ my savior commanded his disciples in the boat, whenthey said to him: Lord, wake up, because the sea frightens us. The Lord awokeimmediately and commanded the sea to stop; then the sea became calm, commandedby the Father, etc.”It is evident that one should read:For the prayer on the salt: panem coelestem accipiam et nomen Dominiinvocabo.573 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_13.xhtml]And below that:Euntes ergo docete omnes gentes baptizantes eos, etc.574[9781101992746_EPUB-53_14.xhtml]The names of Pasle, Colet, and Hervé are those of shepherds associated withmagnetic works. Instead of mortira (line 14) read sortira; and in the followingline read hamlet rather than camel which is an absurd and grotesque nonsensehere.In one of the following formulas, instead of pasque flower (passe flori), oneshould read flowery Easter (pâques fleuri).That which follows was written primitively in verse and we can see, by restoringit, how much it had been disfigured:It was on a Monday morning thatJesus passed by the road,With the holy Virgin beside himAnd M. Saint John his friend,M. Saint John his shepherd boy,who searches for his divine flock.Besotted with malign sheep pox,Malign sheep pox which will be curedAnd from my flock will leaveBy the three kings and the shepherds;From the adorers of Jesus ChristWho went to BethlehemIn passing by JerusalemAnd turn by turn prostrated themselvesAdoring the cross of the child.This example will suffice for understanding to what point these little vulgarbooks on sorcery and the so-called magic they still dare to peddle in thecountryside are altered and have become ridiculous.We can also see that in principle these formulas derive from an ardent and naivefaith. It was in the name of the little child born in a stable, the shepherdswho came to visit him, Saint John the Baptist, man of the desert, alwaysaccompanied by a lamb without blemishes, that the old Christian herdsmanconjured against the evil spells of their enemies. These prayers, or ratherthese acts of faith, were pronounced upon salt, so salutary on its own and soindispensable to the good health of the herd. Our false scholars may now laughat these rustic enchanters; but they knew well what they were doing and theirinstinct, directed by experience, guided them more surely than the poor scienceof the time could have.Now that faith has weakened in the countryside as elsewhere, these naive prayershave almost no power or prestige. At the best we can search them out as curiousmonuments to the beliefs of our ancestors. We find them in handwritten grimoiresand in Leo III’s Enchiridion, a famous little book from the Middle Ages, ofwhich various editions with more or less errors have multiplied in our day. Wehave extracted and provided here the conjurations which were considered the mosteffective.Here begin the mysterious prayers of Pope Leo.Prayers against all sort of charms, enchantments, curses, characters, visions,illusions, possessions, obsessions, evil obstructions to marriage, and anythingthat can occur due to the evil spells of sorcerers, or through the incursion ofdevils; also very good against all types of misfortune caused to horses, mares,bulls, cows, sheep, ewes, and other animal species. Prayer Qui Verbum carofactum est, etc.May the Verb which had been made into flesh, and which had been attached to thecross, and which sits at the right hand side of the Father fulfill the prayersof those who believe in him, he who by his holy name, all knees kneel; and bythe merits of the blessed Virgin Mary his mother, and also by the prayers of allthe saints of God. Deign to protect this creature N from all that could harm it,and from demonic attacks, you who live and reign in the perfect unity; becausehere is [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg]575[9781101992746_EPUB-53_15.xhtml] the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom isfound our salvation, our life and our resurrection, and the confusion of allthose who wish to harm us and from malign spirits; flee then, adversaries,because I conjure you, demons of hell, and you malign spirits, whatever type youmay be; whether you had been called or invoked, whether you come of your ownwill, or you were sent; either by enchantment or by the art of evil men orwomen; who encouraged you to dwell or molest. Until that time when you have leftyour diabolic trickery, you shall depart forthwith[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] in the name of the true[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] living God[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] holy[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] Father[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Son[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], and Holy Spirit. Especially by he[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] who was sacrificed and[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] who was killed as a lamb[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], who was crucified as a man, in theblood with which we had vanquished, when Saint Michael battled with us, andpreceded victory, and made you retreat by the amount you had approached, and sothat you cannot, under any pretext there is, molest or trouble this creature,neither in its body, nor outside its body, through visions, nor by fright, norby day, nor by night, nor in sleeping, nor in waking, nor while eating, norwhile praying, nor while doing other things, either natural or spiritual:otherwise I spread over you [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] all themaledictions, excommunications [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg]degrees and punishments and torments, as though you were thrown into a pool offire and of sulfur by the hands of your enemies, by the command of the HolyTrinity, the archangel Saint Michael executes it. Because if you have previouslytaken any bond of adoration, any perfume, any subtle and evil affliction thatmight be, either with herbs or with words, or in stones, or in the elements,whether natural, whether they are simple or mixtures, or temporal, or spiritual,or sacramental, or in the names of the great God and his angels, whether theyare in the characters of the hours, of minutes, of days, of the year, of months,observed superstitiously by an expressed or tacit pact, even strengthened byvows. I break [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg] all these things, Iannul them and destroy them by the power of the Father who created this world[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], by the wisdom of the redeeming Son,by the grace of the Holy Spirit [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], byhe who accomplished the entire law [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg],who is [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], who was[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], who is to come[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], all-powerful, holy[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], immortal[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Savior[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], which is composed of four letters[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Jehovah[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Alpha and Omega[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], the beginning and the end. May allthe diabolical virtue in this creature be extinguished, and be driven away bythe virtue of the very holy cross, by the invocation of the angels, thearchangels, the patriarchs, the prophets, the apostles, the martyrs, theconfessors, the virgins, and also the blessed Virgin and all those who reign inheaven, with the dead Lamb since the beginning of the world and those who livewell in the holy Church of God. Retreat then; in the manner of the smoke ofliver, of burned fish, according to Raphael’s advice, who chased off the spiritwhich had tormented Sara, in the same manner that these benedictions drive youaway, so that you do not dare approach this creature. Marked with the sign ofthe holy cross, with the area of one hundred thousand feet, because my mandateis not mine, but that of he who was sent by the Father in order to destroy yourworks, as he had destroyed them on the tree of the cross, he gave us such apower, to the glory and utility of the faithful, to command you, as we commandyou and order you; that you dare not approach by Our Savior Jesus Christ[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg]; here is the cross of the Lord, flee,adversaries; the lion of the tribe of Judah has vanquished.

May the Savior come to my aid,and I will not fear what man could do against me; my very kind Jesus Christ,protect me, rescue me, and save me: that in the name of Jesus all knees kneel inthe heavens, on earth and in the hells, and that all tongues confess that OurLord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God our Father. Amen. I know very truly, OJesus, that on any day and hour that may be that I invoke you, I shall be saved.O so clement Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who, by the virtue ofyour very precious name, had operated so many miracles, and who gave the soabundant remedy to us who have so great a need, because, by the virtue of yourname, the demons fled, the blind saw, the deaf heard, the lame walked, the dumbspoke, the lepers were cured, the sick found health, and the dead wereresuscitated; because, when we pronounce the name of your so sweet son, Jesus,we hear a sweet melody in our ears, honey is tasted on our lips, the demonflees, all knees kneel, the celestial spirits rejoice, evil intentions areuprooted, all infirmities are cured; we are granted several indulgences; thestruggles between the world, the flesh, and the devil are exhausted, and manyother good things follow, because whoever invokes the name of God shall besaved, that name that was named by an angel before he was conceived in the womb.For Friday. O nomen dulce, etc.O sweet name, name which fortifies the heart of man, name of life, of salvation,and of joy; precious name, joyous, glorious, and gracious; name which fortifiesthe sinners, name which saves us and which guides and governs the entire machineof the universe. May it please you then, O so pious Jesus! that by the same soprecious virtue of your name you deign to make the demons before me flee;illuminate me, I who am blind; make it so I hear, I who am deaf; guide my steps,I who am lame; make it so I speak, I who am dumb; cure my leprosy, give mehealth, I who am infirm; wake me from death, surround me entirely inside andout, such that being equipped with your so sacred name, I can always live withinyou, in praising you and in honoring you, you who are worthy of praises, becauseyou are the glorious Lord and the eternal Lord and the eternal Son of God,within whom, to whom and by whom all things rejoice and are governed, to you thepraise, the honor and the glory over all the centuries. Amen. May Jesus alwaysbe in my heart, may Jesus always be in my mouth; may Jesus always be in myinward parts. Amen. May God my Lord Jesus Christ be within me to bring me backto health; may he be around me to guide me; may he be next to me to conserve me,in front of me to protect me, on me to bless me; may he be between me to vivifyme, close to me to govern me, above me to fortify me; may he always be with meto take away all the sorrow of an eternal death, he who, with the Father and theHoly Spirit, lives and reigns during all the centuries of centuries. Amen.For Saturday. Jesus Mariae filius, etc.May Jesus, son of Mary, Lord and Savior of the world, be clement and favorableto me, may he give us a healthy and submissive spirit, honor be to God, and mayhe accord us deliverance from our evils in the place where we are: and no onelaid their hands upon him, because his hour had not yet come, he who is, whowas, and will always be Alpha and Omega, God and man, the beginning and the end;may this invocation be my eternal protection, name of Jesus of Nazareth, king ofthe Jews, mark of triumph, son of the Virgin Mary, have pity on me, inaccordance with your clemency, on the road to eternal salvation. Amen. ButJesus, knowing all that must occur to him, came forwards and said to them: “Whomdo you search for?” They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them,“It is I.” Now Judas, who betrayed him, was also present with them. And whenJesus had told them: “It is I,” they were overset and fell to the ground. Heasked them again: “Whom do you search for?” They said to him, “Jesus ofNazareth.” Jesus answered them, “I have already told you that it is I; if it isthus for me that you search, let these others go.” May Jesus, who made himself avictim for me, through his cross effacing my crime, render me agreeable in hiseyes, so that at last my purified soul, being separated from my body, reignswith him in the heavens. Amen. Jesus is the way[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Jesus is life[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Jesus is the truth[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Jesus suffered[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Jesus was crucified[image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg], Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,have pity on me. But Jesus, passing [image/9781101992746_EPUB-53_vector-1.jpg]amongst them, was standing, and no one laid violent hands upon Jesus, becausehis hour had not yet come.For Sunday, Oremus. Dulcissime Domine, etc.Sweetest Lord Jesus Christ, living Son of God, who answered thus to the Jews whowanted to take you: It is I; thus if it is I who you search for, let theseothers go; then the Jews were upturned and fell to the ground. In this way, myso kind Savior Jesus Christ, deign to protect me now and always from all myenemies who look to harm me, and make them upturn and fall, so that they may dome no harm in any manner that there is, but that I withdraw in safety from theirhands onto the road of peace and of rest, in the praise and the glory of yourname, which is blessed in the centuries of centuries. Amen.These prayers, as we can see, are nothing but very pious and very Christian intheir simplicity and can still be the expression of confidence and upright willof a submissive child of the Church.Prayers said together and which are in accord with the ardent faith of themajority, truly constitute a magnetic current and what we mean by magnetismworks in circles.Evil spells are only dangerous for isolated individuals; it is thus important,especially for people from the countryside, to live in families, to have peacein their household, and to make numerous friends.One must also, for the health of the herds, properly air and expose the stablesto the sun; batten the ground well which one can cover with a sort of pavementof wood charcoal, purify unhealthy water with a charcoal filter,578[9781101992746_EPUB-53_18.xhtml] give the beasts salt that is not exorcised, butmagnetized according to the intentions of the master, avoid as much as possibleneighboring herds belonging to an enemy or a rival, rub sick ewes with a mix ofpulverized wood charcoal and sulfur, then often change their litter and givethem good grass.One must also carefully avoid the company of persons afflicted with black orchronic sicknesses, never speak to village seers and enchanters, because inconsulting these sorts of people, one in a way places oneself under their power,finally, one must have confidence in God alone and let nature do its work.Priests often pass for sorcerers in the countryside, and they are believed to berelatively capable of exercising an evil influence, which is unfortunately truein regards to evil priests; but a good priest, far from bringing bad luck foranyone, is a benediction for families and the regions.There also exist dangerous madmen who believe in the influence of the spirit ofdarkness, and who are not afraid of evoking him so as to make him a servant totheir evil desires; one must apply to these types that which we have said aboutdiabolical evocations, and most of all to guard oneself well against believingthem or imitating them.To command the elementary forces, one must have pure morals and a strong senseof justice. The man who makes a worthy and noble use of his intelligence and hisliberty is truly the king of nature, but beings of human shape who allowthemselves to be dominated by bestial instincts are not even worthy ofcommanding animals. The Desert Fathers were served by lions and by bears.Daniel, in the lion’s den, was not touched by any of those starving animals,and, in fact, say the masters of the great art of the Cabala, ferocious beastsnaturally respect men and only attack them when they take them for other animalswho are hostile or inferior to them. Animals, in effect, communicate throughtheir physical soul with the universal astral light and are endowed with aparticular intuition for seeing the plastic mediator of men under the form whichhad been given to it through the regular exercise of free will.The veritable truth alone appears to them, in the splendor of the human form,and they are forced to obey its regard and its voice; other animals attract themas prey or scare them and irritate them as dangers. It is for this reason,according to the prophet Isaiah, that when justice will reign on earth, and whenmen will raise their families in true innocence, a little child will lead thetigers and the lions, and will play with impunity in their midst.Prosperity and joy should be the privilege of the just; for them misfortuneitself changes into a blessing, and the pain they experience is like the goad ofthe divine shepherd who forces them to always walk and progress along the waysof perfection. The Sun greets them in the morning, and the Moon smiles at themat night. For them, sleep is without anxiety, and dreams without terror, theirpresence blesses the Earth and brings happiness to the living. Happy are thosewho resemble them! happy are those who take them for friends!Physical evil is often a consequence of moral evil, disorder necessarily followsunreason. And unreason in action is injustice. The laborious life of theinhabitants of the countryside too often render them hard and greedy. From therea host of errors in judgment and there follows an imbalance of actions whichforces nature to protest and to react. That is the secret of those evildestinies which sometimes seem to attach themselves to a family or a house. Theancients would then say: one must appease the offended gods, and they tell usstill: the good acquired through evil profits no one, one must give back, onemust repair the evil committed, one must satisfy justice, or justice will takerevenge in a fatal manner.A power, invincible if we wish it, was given to us to vanquish fatality: it isour moral liberty. With the aid of this power, we can correct destiny and remakethe future. That is why religion does not want us to consult the seers to knowwhat will happen to us; it wants only that we learn from our pastors what weshould do. What do obstacles matter to us? A brave man should not count hisenemies before the battle. To provide for evil is to render it in a waynecessary. We will arrive at the result that we had wanted: there is theuniversal prophecy.To observe nature, to follow the laws in our work, to obey reason in all things,to sacrifice, if need be, one’s own interest for justice. That is the true magicwhich brings happiness, and those who act thus fear neither the malice ofenchanters not the sorcery of shepherds.RESPONSES TO SOME QUESTIONS AND CRITICISMSFIRST QUESTIONQuestion: Do you hope that serious Catholics will accept your Cabalisticbeliefs, your philosophical interpretations of doctrine, and even yourdefinition of Catholicism, that is to say universality in matters of religion?Response: If by serious Catholics you mean those who deny civilization and itsprogress, I certainly hope not.Q: So you are a Protestant?R: Yes, if one is a Protestant when he believes in civilization and progress.Q: Why then do you call yourself a Roman Catholic?R: Because I do not believe that we should even exclude Romans from theuniversal communion.Q: What do you hope to achieve if, while calling yourself Catholic, you do nothope to convert true Catholics?R: I would like to bring back to the hierarchical unity, to the integrity of thedoctrine and the effectiveness of the cult, the dissident Christian communions,and this is possible for the communions emancipated by the reform, since theyaccept civilization and progress.SECOND QUESTIONQ: Do you perform miracles and can you teach the means of performing them?R: If by miracles you mean works counter to nature or effects unjustified bytheir causes, no, I neither perform nor teach how to perform such miracles. Godhimself would not know how to do such things.THIRD QUESTIONQ: How do you answer those who accuse you of credulity, of superstition, or ofcharlatanism?R: I answer that they have not read my books or that, having read them, they didnot understand them. It was thus that a Sir Tavernier, in a so-called critiqueof the Key to the Great Mysteries, was not afraid to write that I evokedArchaea, Azoth and Hyle, well known devils, he adds. Yet who does not know thatby Archaea the ancients meant the universal soul, by Azoth, the mediatingsubstance, and by Hyle, the passive matter?FOURTH QUESTIONQ: How do you answer to those, like Sir Gougenot des Mousseaux, who call yourwritings abominable books?R: I take care not to answer their offenses with more offenses, and feel sorryfor them because they are subject to beliefs which translate into recklessjudgments and insults.—Eliphas LéviTHE RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND MORAL TENDENCIES OF OUR BOOKS ON MAGICSince the first edition of this book was published,579[9781101992746_EPUB-53_19.xhtml] several major events have occurred in theworld, and others which are perhaps even greater will soon come to pass.As usual, these events were forecast by various prophecies: the tables hadspoken, voices had arisen from the walls, and disembodied hands had writtenmysterious words as at Belshazzar’s feast.Fanaticism, in the last convulsions of its agony, signaled this finalpersecution of Christians as predicted by all the prophets. The martyrs ofDamas580 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_20.xhtml] asked the dead of Perugia581[9781101992746_EPUB-53_21.xhtml] for the name of the one who saves and whoblesses; then the sky clouded over and the earth remained silent.More than ever, science and religion, despotism and liberty seem to be fightinga relentless war and swearing irreconcilable hatred for each other. Do notbelieve in bloody appearances, however: they are on the cusp of uniting andembracing each other forever.The discovery of the great secrets of religion and of the primitive science ofthe Mages, in revealing to the world the unity of the universal dogma,annihilates fanaticism by proving the prophecies to be correct. The human word,the creator of the marvels of man, unites forever with the word of God, and endsthe universal antimony within us, making us understand that harmony is theresult of the analogy of opposites.The greatest Catholic genius of modern times, Count Joseph de Maistre,582[9781101992746_EPUB-53_23.xhtml] had foreseen this great event. “Newton,” hesaid, “brings us back to Pythagoras, and the analogy that exists between scienceand faith must sooner or later come closer together. The world is withoutreligion, but such a monstrosity cannot exist for long; the eighteenth centurycontinues on, but it will end.”Sharing the faith and hope of this great man, we dared to search through theruins of the old sanctuaries of occultism; we asked of the secret doctrines ofthe Chaldeans, the Egyptians, and the Hebrews, to provide the secrets of thetransfiguration of the dogmas, and the eternal truth answered us: the truth,which is one and universal, like existence; the truth, which belongs to scienceas much as to faith; the truth, mother of reason and of justice; the livingtruth in the forces of nature, the mysterious Elohim which remake the sky andthe earth when chaos takes over creation and its marvels for a time, and whenthe spirit of God soars alone over the abyss of the oceans.The truth is above all opinions and all parties.The truth is like the Sun; blind is he who does not see it. This was themeaning, we do not doubt it, of a famous speech of Bonaparte’s, spoken by him ata time when the conqueror of Italy, summarizing the French revolution incarnatein him alone, began to understand how the Republic could be a truth.Truth is life, and life is revealed through movement. Also through movement,through willed and effective movement, through action, to use a single word,life develops and takes on new forms. Yet, the developments of life by itself,and its giving birth to new forms; we call creation. The intelligent power whichworks through universal movement, we call the Verb, in a transcendental andabsolute manner. It is the initiative of God, which can never remain withouteffect, and never stops without achieving its goal. For God, speaking is doing;and such should be the power of speech even among men: true speech is the seedof action. An emission of intelligence and will cannot be sterile unless therewas abuse or profanation of its original dignity. And it is for this reason thatthe Savior of men must hold us severely to account for all disorienting thoughtswithout a legitimate goal, and even more importantly, for idle speech.Jesus, according to the Gospel, was powerful in his deeds and in his words;deeds before words: it is in this manner that one’s right to speak isestablished and proven. Jesus began to do and to speak, says an evangelistelsewhere, and often, in the primitive language of the holy Scripture, an actionis called a verb. In every language in fact, we call a VERB that which expressesat the same time being and action, and there is no verb that cannot be replacedby the verb to do by diversifying the structure of the sentence. In theprinciple was the Verb, said Saint John the evangelist. In what principle? Inthe first principle; in the absolute principle which comes before all things.Thus, in this principle was the Verb, that is to say, action. This isincontestable in philosophy, since the first principle is necessarily the firstdriving force. The Verb is not an abstraction: it is the most positive principlein the world, because it is continually made evident by deeds. The philosophy ofthe Verb is essentially the philosophy of action and of done deeds, and it is inthis manner that we can distinguish a verb from a word. Words can sometimes besterile, like a harvest of empty corn husks, but such is never the case with theVerb. The Verb, is the full and fertile word; men do not amuse themselves bylistening to and applauding it; they always fulfill it! Often withoutunderstanding it, almost never without having resisted it. The doctrines werepeat are not the ones which succeed. Christianity was still a mystery when theCaesars sensed that they were dethroned by the Christian Verb. A system whichthe world admires and the crowds applaud, can only be a brilliant assembly ofsterile words; a system to which humanity is subjected to, in a manner ofsaying, despite itself, is a Verb.Power is demonstrated by results, and as was written, it is said, by a profoundpolitician from modern times: Responsibility is only important when one does notsucceed.583 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_24.xhtml] These words, which some intelligentminds had found to be immoral, are equally true if applied to all the particularnotions which distinguish the word from the Verb, the will from action, or, moreprecisely, the imperfect act from the perfect act. The man who damns himself,according to Catholic theology, is he who is unable to save himself. To sin isto lack happiness. The man who does not succeed is always wrong: whether inliterature, in ethics, or in politics. The bad person of all types is thebeautiful and the good poorly achieved. And if we have to go higher up to thedomain of the eternal dogma, two spirits met in the old days, each of whomwished divinity for themselves alone: one succeeded, and it is he who is God;the other failed and became the devil!To succeed is to be able to; to fail forever is to try eternally: these twowords summarize the opposing destinies of the spirit of good and the spirit ofevil.When a will modifies the world, it is the Verb which speaks, and all voices aresilenced before it, as is said in the book of Maccabees, in regards toAlexander: but Alexander died with his Verb of power, because there was nofuture in him; unless the grandeur of Rome was the realization of his dreams!Yet in our times something even stranger is occurring: a man who died in exilein the middle of the Atlantic Ocean has silenced Europe a second time before hisVerb, and he holds the entire world suspended before the power of his namealone!584 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_25.xhtml]This is because Napoleon’s mission was great and saintly; it is because the Verbof truth was in him. Napoleon alone could, after the French Revolution, raisethe altars of Catholicism, and it was Napoleon’s moral heir alone who had theright to bring Pius IX back to Rome.585 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_26.xhtml] We willexplain why.In the Catholic doctrine of Incarnation there is a dogma known to thetheological schools under the title of Communication of Idioms. This dogmaaffirms that in the union of divinity and humanity accomplished by Jesus Christthe joining of the two natures was so close that the result was one identity anda very simple unity of personhood, which means that Mary, mother of man, couldand should be called the Mother of God. (The entire world debated in favor ofthis prerogative at the time of the Council of Ephesus.) Which means as wellthat we can attribute to God the sufferings of man and to man the glories ofGod. In one word, the Communication of idioms is the solidarity of the divineand human natures in Jesus Christ; a solidarity in the name of which we can saythat God is man, and that man is God.Zoroastrianism, in revealing to the world the universal law of equilibrium andharmony resulting from the analogy of opposites, takes all the sciences at theirbase and was the prelude by the reform of mathematics to a universal revolutionin all the branches of human knowledge: to the principal generator of numbers itattaches the principal generator of ideas, and in consequence the principalgenerator of worlds, thus bringing to the light of science the unpredictableresult of the overly physical intuitions of Pythagoras; he confronts thetheurgical esotericism of the school of Alexandria with a clear, precise, andabsolute formula which all the regenerated sciences reveal and justify: thefirst reason and the last final universal movement, whether through ideas orthrough the forms, can, for him, be definitively summarized in a few algebraicsigns in the form of an equation.Mathematics, thus understood, brings us to religion, because it becomes, in allits forms, the demonstration of the infinite generator of the firmament andproof of the absolute, from which emanates all the calculations of all thesciences. This supreme and inevitable consequence of the works of the humanspirit, this conquest of divinity by intelligence and by study, must completethe redemption of the human soul and provide the definitive emancipation of theVerb of humanity. And thus, what we still call today the natural law will haveall the authority and all the infallibility of a revealed law; and thus also, wewill understand that the positive and divine law is at the same time a naturallaw, since God is the creator of nature and would be unable to contradicthimself in his creations and his laws.From this reconciliation of the human Verb shall be born true morality, whichdoes not yet exist in a complete and definitive manner. And so a new path willalso open up for the universal Church. Indeed, up until the present, theinfallibility of the Church was just dogma, and for this reason, no doubt, theDivinity did not wish to have to deal with men who were asked to understand whatpreviously they were simply required to believe. But to constitute morality, thesituation is different, because morality is as human as it is divine; and manmust have the choice of consent to a pact which obliges him the most. Do youknow what the epoch which we are heading towards lacks the most? It is morality.Everyone senses it, everyone says so, yet the schools of ethics are openeverywhere. What do these schools need? A teaching which would inspireconfidence; in a word, a reasonable authority instead of reason withoutauthority on the one hand, and authority without reason on the other.Let us note that the question of morality was the pretext for the greatdefection which has now left the Church widowed and desolate. It is in the nameof humanity, that material expression of charity, that we raised the instinctsof the people against the dogmas, which were falsely accused of being inhuman.Catholic morality is not inhuman, but it is often superhuman; it is also notmeant for men of the old world and is part of a dogma which sees as possible thedestruction of old man and the creation of a new man. High magic receives thisdogma with enthusiasm and promises this spiritual renaissance to humanity duringthe future epoch of the rehabilitation of the human Verb. And so, he said, man,having become Creator in the place of God, will be the architect of his moraldevelopment and the author of his glorious immortality. To create oneself, thatis the sublime vocation of man reestablished in all his rights by the baptism ofthe spirit; and such a connection will manifest itself between immortality andmorality that one will be the complement and the consequence of the other.The light of truth is also the light of life. But truth, for it to be fertile inimmortality, wishes to be received by souls which are both free and submissive,that is to say voluntarily obedient. In the splendor of this clarity, order isestablished in the forms as in the ideas, while the deceiving twilight of theimagination gives birth, and can only give birth, to monsters. Thus hell ispeopled with nightmares and phantoms; thus the temple of soothsayers is filledwith dreadful and deformed divinities; thus the shadowy invocations of theurgygive the chimeras of the Sabbath a fantastical existence. The symbolic andpopular images of the temptation of Saint Anthony represent a pure and simplefaith, at the dawn of Christianity, fighting against all the specters of the oldworld: but the human Verb, manifest and victorious, was depicted in theadmirable Saint Michael, whom Raphael painted vanquishing, with a simple threat,an inferior being who also had a human face, but of a brutish aspect.The religious mystics wish us to do good uniquely by obeying God. In the orderof the true morality, one must still do good according to the will of God, nodoubt, but also for good itself. Goodness is within God the just by his essence,which does not constrain, but which determines his liberty. God cannot damn themajority of men through capricious despotism. There must exist an exactproportion between the actions of man and the creation determined by His willfrom which definitively arises a power of good or an auxiliary of evil, and itis this which is demonstrated by the exact science of high magic.Here is what we wrote in a book published in 1845: “The time of blind faith hasnow passed, and we arrive at an epoch of intelligent faith and reasonableobedience, a time where we no longer only believe in God, but where we willobserve him in his works, which are the exterior forms of his being.“But here is the great problem of our times:“To trace, complete, and close the circle of human knowledge, then, through theconvergence of radii, to find the center, which is God.“To find a proportional scale between the effects, desires, and the causes andto go up from there to arrive at the first cause and the first will.“To constitute a science of analogies between ideas and their first source.“To render all religious truth as certain and as clearly demonstrable as thesolution to a geometry problem.”Here, now, is what one man says who was lucky enough to discover before us thedemonstration of the absolute according to the ancient sages, but also unluckyenough to see in this discovery only an instrument of fortune and a pretext forcupidity.“It suffices to say here, in anticipation of the Messianic doctrine, that on onehand, the application of absolute reason upon our psychological faculty ofcognition produces in us the superior faculty of the creation of principles andthe deduction of consequences, which is the great goal of philosophy; and, onthe other hand, that the application of absolute reason upon our psychologicalfaculty of feeling produces in us the superior faculty of moral and religioussentiment, which is the great goal of religion. We can thus begin to see howMessianism will achieve the final union of philosophy and religion by freeingboth from their physical and terrestrial constraints and by bringing them,beyond their temporal conditions, to absolute reason, which is their commonsource. We can also already recognize how, through the influence of thesetemporal conditions or through these physical constraints, on one hand, Error inthe philosophical domain, and on the other, Sin is the religious domain, becomepossible; especially when these physical conditions are part and parcel of thehereditary moral depravity of the human species, which is an aspect of itsterrestrial nature. And we can thus understand how absolute reason, which isabove these physical conditions, these terrestrial contaminants, and which, inMessianism, must destroy the very source of error and sin, forms, under theallegorical expression of the Virgin who must crush the Serpent’s head, theaccomplishment of this holy prediction. It is thus this august Virgin thatMessianism introduces today into the sanctuary of humanity.”Believe, and you shall understand, said the Savior of the world; study, and youshall believe, the apostles of high magic now can say.To believe is to know through the word. Yet that divine Word, which was ahead ofand replaced the Christian science for a time, we only understood later,according to the Master’s promise. That, then, is the agreement between scienceand faith demonstrated by faith itself.But, to establish the necessity of that agreement through science, one mustrecognize and establish a grand principle: it is that the absolute is not foundat either of the two extremities of the antinomy, and that men who take sides,who always pull towards the opposite extremes, are at the same time fearful ofarriving at those extremes, and consider those who clearly admit to theirtendencies as dangerous madmen, and within their own system they instinctivelyfear the ghost of the absolute as if it were the void or death. This is why thepious archbishop of Paris formally disapproves of the conceited inquests of theUnivers,586 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_27.xhtml] and why the entire revolutionaryparty was outraged by the cruelties of Proudhon.587[9781101992746_EPUB-53_28.xhtml]The power of this negative proof consists of this simple observation: that acentral link must unite two apparently opposite tendencies, which cannot take astep without having the other being pulled along backwards; and which will thenrequire an equal reaction. And that is what has been happening for twocenturies: chained to one another without their knowledge and from behind, thesetwo powers are condemned to a Sisyphean labor and mutually obstruct each other.Turn them around and direct them to the central point, which is the absolute,then they will meet each other head on, and, supporting each other, they willproduce a stability which is equal to the power of their contrary efforts,multiplied by the one times the other.To thus turn around the human powers, which seems at first to be a Herculeaneffort, it suffices to disabuse minds and show them the goal which they thoughtan obstacle.Religion is reasonable. That is what one must tell philosophy, and through thesimultaneity and the correspondence of the generative laws of dogma and ofscience we can prove it completely. Reason is holy. That is what one must tellthe Church, and we will prove it to her by applying to the triumph of itsdoctrine of charity all the conquests of emancipation and all the glories ofprogress.Jesus Christ being the example of humanity born anew, the divinity renderedhuman had as his mission to render humanity divine: The Verb made flesh allowedthe flesh to become the Verb, and that is what the doctors of the Church did notunderstand to start with; their mysticism had them absorb humanity in thedivinity. They denied the human right in the name of the divine right; theybelieved that faith must annihilate reason, without remembering the profoundwords of one of the greatest Christian hierophants: “Any intellect which dividesthe Christ is an intellect of the Antichrist.”588[9781101992746_EPUB-53_29.xhtml]The revolt of the human spirit against the Church, a revolt which was punishedby a terrible negative success, was thus, from this point of view, a protest infavor of the doctrine of the whole, and the revolution, which has lasted forthree centuries and a half, was only due to an immense misunderstanding!In fact, the Catholic Church has never denied, nor can it deny, human divinity,the Verb made flesh, the human Verb! The Church never consented to thoseabsorbing and irritating doctrines which destroy human liberty in a senselessquietism.589 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_30.xhtml] Bossuet had the courage to hectorMadame Guyon,590 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_31.xhtml] whom he admired nonethelessand whom we admired after him for her conscientious folly; but Bossuet lived,unfortunately, only after the Council of Trent. The divine experience had toinevitably go through stages of sickness.Yes, we call the French Revolution a divine experience, because God, at thattime, allowed the human genius to measure itself against Him; a strange conflictwhich had to end up in a tight ligature; the downfall of the prodigal son whosesole future was a decisive return and a solemn celebration in the house of thefamily father.591 [9781101992746_EPUB-53_32.xhtml]The divine Verb and the human Verb, conceived separately, but with a sense ofsolidarity that rendered them inseparable, had from the start founded the papacyand the empire: the struggle of the papacy to reign alone had been through theabsolute affirmation of the divine Verb; with that affirmation, to reestablishthe balance of the dogma of Incarnation, there had to be a correspondingabsolute affirmation of the human Verb in the empire. Such was the origin of theReform, which resulted in the Rights of Man.The Rights of Man! Napoleon manifested them by the glory with which hesurrounded his sword. Incarnate and summed up in Napoleon, the revolutionstopped being disorderly, and produced with its resounding success theirrefutable proof of his Verb. It is then that one lives, a thing unheard of inthe ceremonious pomp of religions! For man to extend, in turn, his hand to God,as though to raise him from his fall. A pope, whose piety and orthodoxy wasnever questioned, had just sanctioned, with the authority of all the Christiancenturies, the holy usurpation of the new Caesar, and the revolution incarnatewas consecrated, that is to say Napoleon received the anointment of the Christfrom the very hand of the most venerable successor of the fathers of authority!It is due to the same type of occurrences, just as universal, just asincontestable and as brilliantly clear as the light of the Sun, it is due to thesame type of occurrences, that Messianism was founded in the past.The affirmation of the divine Verb by the human Verb, insisted upon by thelatter right up to suicide, through abnegation and holy frenzy, that is thehistory of the Church since Constantine up until the Reformation.The immortality of the human Verb proven through terrible convulsions, by afrenzied revolt, by gigantic battles and by suffering similar to that ofPrometheus, until the arrival of a man strong enough to reconnect humanity toGod: that is the history of the entire revolution!Faith and reason! Two terms which we believe are opposites and which areidentical.Authority and liberty, two opposites which are at bottom the same thing, sinceone cannot exist without the other.Religion and science, two contradictions which mutually destroy each other ascontradictions, and reciprocally affirm each other if we consider them as twofraternal affirmations.That is the problem already posed and resolved by history. That is the enigma ofthe Sphinx explained by the Oedipus of modern times, the Napoleonic genius.It is assuredly a spectacle worthy of all the sympathies of the human genius,and we would add, worthy of the admiration of even the coldest minds, that sucha movement, this simultaneous progress, these equal tendencies, those predictedfalls, and those equally infallible rebounds, of divine wisdom, on one hand,poured into humanity, and human wisdom, on the other hand, steered by divinity!They are rivers arising from the same source, they separate only to embrace theworld more readily, and when they reunite, they will carry off everything withthem. All the higher souls predicted this synthesis, this triumph, this drivingforce, this definitive salvation of the world: but who then, before these greatevents which revive and raise to such heights the power of human magic and theintervention of God in the works of reason, who, then, had dared predict them?We have said that the objective of the revelation was the affirmation of thedivine Verb, and that the affirmation of the human Verb was the transcendentaland providential result of the European revolution started in the sixteenthcentury.The divine founder of Christianity was the Messiah of the revelation, becausethe divine Verb was incarnate in him, and we consider the emperor as the Messiahof the revolution, because the human Verb is summarized and manifested in him inall its power.The divine Messiah had been sent to save humanity, which was wasting away, wornout by the tyranny of the senses and the orgies of the flesh.The human Messiah came in a way to save God who offended the obscene cult ofreason, and to save the Church, which was threatened by revolts of the humanspirit and by saturnalias of false philosophy.After the reform and the revolution in Napoleon’s wake had shaken the base ofall of Europe’s powers, after the negation of the divine right had transformedalmost all the masters of the world into usurpers and handed over the politicaluniverse to atheism or the fetishism of the parties, one sole people, guardiansof the doctrines of unity and authority, had become the people of God inpolitics. And that people grew in strength in an impressive manner, inspired byan idea that could be transformed into a Verb, that is to say into a word ofaction: that people were the vigorous Slavic race, and the idea was that ofPeter the Great."},{"pageContent":"INDEXThe page numbers in this index refer to the printed version of this book.
