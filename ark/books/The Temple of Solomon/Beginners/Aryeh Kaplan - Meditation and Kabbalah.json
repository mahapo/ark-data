Many would question the wisdomand propriety of placing such information in a printed book, especially in an Englishtranslation. But so much misinformation has already been published that it is virtuallyimperative that an authentic, authoritative account be published. It is for this reason, aswell as other reasons which I am bound by an oath to conceal, that the great livingmasters of Kabbalah have voiced their approval that such a book be published.The science of Kabbalah is divided into three basic areas: the theoretical, themeditative, and the practical.The theoretical deals with the form of the mysteries, teaching the structure of theangelic domains as well as of the Sefirot, or Divine Emanations. With great success, itdeals with problems posed by the many schools of philosophy, and it provides aconceptual framework into which all theological ideas can be fitted. More importantfor the discussion at hand, it also provides a framework through which the mechanismof both the meditative and practical Kabbalah can be understood.Some three thousand Kabbalah texts exist in print, and, for the most part, the vastmajority deal with the theoretical Kabbalah. Falling within this category are the bestknown Kabbalah works, such as the Zohar and the Bahir, which are almost totallytheoretical in their scope. The same is true of the writings of Rabbi Isaac Luria, theAri, considered by many to have been the greatest of all Kabbalists. With the passageof time, this school probed deeper and deeper into the philosophical ramifications ofthe primary Kabbalistic concepts, producing an extremely profound, self-consistentand satisfying philosophical system.The practical Kabbalah, on the other hand, was a kind of white magic, dealing withthe use of techniques that could evoke supernatural powers. It involved the use ofdivine names and incantations, amulets and talismans, as well as chiromancy,physiognomy and astrology. Many theoretical Kabbalists, led by the Ari, frowned onthe use of such techniques, labeling them as dangerous and spiritually demeaning. As aresult, only a very small number of texts have survived at all, mostly in manuscriptform, and only a handful of the most innocuous of these have been published.It is significant to note that a number of techniques alluded to in these fragmentsalso appear to have been preserved among the non-Jewish school of magic in Europe.The relationship between the practical Kabbalah and these magical schools wouldconstitute an interesting area of study.The meditative Kabbalah stands between these two extremes. Some of the earliestmeditative methods border on the practical Kabbalah, and their use is discouraged bythe latter masters, especially those of the Ari's school. Within this category are the few"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"surviving texts from the Talmudic period. The same is true of the teachings of theThirteenth Century master, Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, whose meditative works havenever been printed and survive only in manuscript.Most telling is a statement at the end of Shaarey Kedushah (Gates of Holiness),which is essentially a meditative manual. The most important and explicit part of thistext is the fourth section, which actually provides instructions in meditation. When thisbook was first printed in 1715, the publisher omitted this last, most important section,with the following note:The printer declares that this fourth section is not to be copied or printed sinceit consists entirely of divine names, permutations and concealed mysteries, andit is not proper to bring them on the altar of the printing press.Actually, upon examining this section, we find that “divine names andpermutations” play a relatively small role, and could easily have been omitted. Butbesides this, the section in question also presents explicit instructions for the varioustechniques of Kabbalah meditation, and even this was considered too secret a doctrineto be published for the masses.The Ari himself also made use of a system of meditation involving Yechudim(unifications), and this was included in the main body of his writings, particularly inthe Shaar Ruach HaKodesh (Gate of the Holy Spirit). But even here, it is significant tonote that, although the Ari lived in the Sixteenth Century, this text was not printeduntil 1863. For over three hundred years, it was available only in manuscript.With the spread of the Hasidic movement in the Eighteenth Century, a number ofmeditative techniques became more popular, especially those centered around theformal prayer service. This reached its zenith in the teachings of Rabbi Nachman ofBreslov (1772–1810), who discusses meditation in considerable length. He developed asystem that could be used by the masses, and it was primarily for this reason thatRabbi Nachman's teachings met with much harsh opposition.One of the problems in discussing meditation, either in Hebrew or in English, is thefact that there exists only a very limited vocabulary with which to express the various“technical” terms. For the sake of clarity, a number of such terms, such as “mantra”and “mandala” have been borrowed from the various meditative systems of the East.This is not meant in any way to imply that there is any connection or relationshipbetween these systems and the Kabbalah. Terms such as these are used only becausethere are no Western equivalents. Since they are familiar to most contemporaryreaders, they have the advantage of making the text more readily understood.Many people express surprise that the Jewish tradition contains a formal meditativesystem, that, at least in its outward manifestations, does resemble some of the Easternsystems. This resemblance was first noted in the Zohar, which recognized the merit ofthe Eastern systems, but warned against their use."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The fact that different systems resemble each other is only a reflection on theveracity of the technique, which is primarily one of spiritual liberation. The fact thatother religions make use of it is of no more consequence than the fact that they alsoengage in prayer and worship. This does not make Jewish worship and prayer any lessmeaningful or unique, and the same is true of meditation. It is basically a technique forreleasing oneself from the bonds of one's physical nature. Where one goes from theredepends very much on the system used."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEMeditation1. THE SCHOOLSIt is universally accepted by the Kabbalists that the first ones to engage in thesemeditative methods were the patriarchs and prophets, who used them to attainenlightenment and prophecy. Although there are many allusions to this in the Bible,the scripture is virtually silent when it comes to providing explicit descriptions of theirmethods. Still, if one looks at the appropriate texts, one can gain considerable insightinto the methods that were in use in the time of the prophets.1The earliest direct statement regarding method comes from the First Century, fromthe early Talmudic period. Here we find some of the greatest Talmudists engaged inthe mystical arts, making use of a number of meditative techniques to attain spiritualelevation and ascend to the transcendental realm. Many of these techniques consistedof the repetition of divine names, as well as intense concentration on thetranscendental spheres. What little we know of their methods is preserved in a fewfragments, as well in a remarkable complete text, Hekhalot Rabatai (The GreaterChambers), of which the main parts are presented for the first time in translation inthis book.It was during this period that some of the main classics of Kabbalah were written.These include the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation), the Bahir and the Zohar. Theseinvolved even higher levels than those described in the Hekhalot, and for the most part,only the barest hints are provided as to how these levels were reached.With the close of the Talmudic period, these methods became restricted to a fewvery small closed secret societies. Both the Bahir and the Zohar remained completelyunknown outside of these societies, and were not revealed until the late Twelfth andThirteenth Centuries respectively. The publication of the Bahir in particular gaveimpetus to the study of the mysteries, and a number of individuals began to openlyteach the secret methods.Most remarkable among these was Rabbi Abraham Abulafia (1240–1295). Havingreceived the tradition from earlier sources, he was the first to actually put them inwriting. For this, he weas condemned in many circles, although most Kabbalistsconsider his methods to be authentic and based on a reliable tradition. Several of hiscontemporaries, most notably, Rabbi Isaac of Acco and Rabbi Joseph Gikatalia, alsospeak of meditative methods."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Most of their work, however, was eclipsed by the publication of the Zohar in themiddle 1290's. This great classic gripped the imagination of almost all Kabbalists ofthe time, and the teachings of other schools was virtually forgotten. It is therefore noaccident that many books written before this were never published, and among thosewhich have not been lost, a good number exist only in manuscript.Since the Zohar has little to say about meditative methods, many importantKabbalists began to ignore the subject completely. They were too involved in trying tounravel the mysteries of this ancient book that had been concealed for many centuries.There were a few exceptions, however, and these Kabbalists made use of the methodsof Abulafia, Gikatalia and Isaac of Acco. For over two hundred years, however, we findvirtually nobody exploring the Zohar itself to ascertain the meditative methods used byits authors.The main attempts in this direction occurred in the Safed School, which flourishedduring the Sixteenth Century. It reached its zenith in the teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria(1534–1572), commonly known as the Ari, who showed how the various lettercombinations found in the Zohar were actually meant to be used as meditative devices.Although the Ari wrote almost nothing himself, his teachings were arduously copiedby his disciplies, and fill almost two dozen large volumes. To a large extent, all thiswas an introduction to the methodology involved in his system of meditation.Just as the Zohar had overshadowed everything when it was published, so did thewritings of the Ari overwhelm the other schools three centuries later. His teachingswere seen as the ultimate expression of the Kabbalah, and for the next two hundredyears, the greatest part of Kabbalah literature devoted itself to their interpretation.Although the Ari's meditative methods were used by a few individuals, and possibly byone or two minor schools, for the most part the Kabbalists devoted themselves totheory rather than practice.The next great renascence came with the rise of the Hasidic movement, founded byRabbi Israel, the Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760). When their works are studied, itbecomes obvious that the Baal Shem and his closest disciples were ardent students ofthe earlier meditative texts of the Kabbalah, and in the Hasidic classics, these texts areoften paraphrased. During the second half of the Eighteenth Century, and perhaps thefirst decade or two of the Nineteenth, many people engaged in the classical meditativetechniques of Kabbalah, often describing the high spiritual states that they attained.The opposition to this, especially where it involved teaching these methods to themasses, was very strong. An entire group, known as the Mitnagdim (opposers), arose tocombat the Hasidim, vigorously denouncing their methods. As a result, the Hasidimthemselves began to de-emphasise their meditative practices, and eventually thesewere virtually forgotten.2. METHODS"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Meditation is primarily a means of attaining spiritual liberation. Its various methodsare designated to loosen the bond of the physical, allowing the individual to ascend tothe transcendental, spiritual realm. One who accomplishes this successfully is said tohave attained Ruach HaKodesh, The “Holy Spirit,” which is the general Hebraic termfor enlightenment.The best-known contemporary method of meditation is that which involves amantra, a word or phrase that is repeated over and over for a designated period of time.One concentrates on the mantra to the exclusion of all else, thus clearing the mind ofall extraneous thoughts and divorcing it from the normal stream of consciousness. Inthis method, the mantra may be repeated verbally, or the repetition may be completelymental. This type of meditation is found in the Kabbalah, especially among the earlierschools. In the Hekhalot, for example, one begins his spiritual ascent by repeating anumber of Divine Names 112 times.Mantra meditation is an example of structured, externally directed meditation. It isexternally directed, insofar as one concentrates on a word or phrase, rather than on thespontaneous thoughts to the mind. Since it involves a specific practice, repeated for afixed length of time, it is considered a structured meditation.Another example of structured externally-directed meditation is contemplation,where one gazes at an object, placing all of one's concentration on it. In occultpractices, the best-known type of contemplation involves gazing into a crystal ball.2Other types of contemplation involve mandalas, pictures or letter designs, where onegazes upon them, emptying the mind of all other thought. In Kabbalah meditation, thesimplest contemplative device is the Tetragrammaton itself, and this is discussed evenin non-Kabbalistic works.3 More complex forms are also used, and this method seemsto have reached its zenith under the influence of Rabbi Shalom Sharabi (1702–1777).Very closely related to this is the method of Yechudim (Unifications), which playsan important role in the system of the Ari. Here one does not contemplate a physicalpicture, but rather a mental image, asually consisting of various combinations ofdivine names. Since the structures and combinations of these names are predetermined,and do not arise spontaneously in the mind, this is also considered to be an externally-directed meditation.The second basic method of meditation is that which is internally-directed. Thisconsists of meditating on thoughts, feelings or mental images that arise spontaneouslyin the mind. Usually, this is best accomplished by focusing on a general area, aroundwhich these thoughts will be evoked. Since there is no formal or predetermined methodof evoking such thoughts, this is most commonly an unstructured meditation.Internally-directed meditation can be practiced purely in thought, or, as in somesystems, one's thoughts can also be verbalized. One of the best methods of verbalizingsuch thoughts while keeping them concentrated on a single focus is to express them as"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"spontaneous prayer. It is this method that forms the basis for the meditative system ofRabbi Nachman of Breslov.The third basic type of meditation is that which is non-directed. Such meditationstrives for a stillness of the mind and a withdrawal from all perception, both internaland external. It plays an important role in the advancd states of many other methods,but at the same time, it can also be used as a method in its own right. Very little isexpressly written about this method, but it appears to play a role in the teachings ofsuch Hasidic masters as Rabbi Dov Baer, the Maggid of Mezrich (1704–1772) andRabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichov (1740–1809).There is evidence that this method was used, at least for the most advanced, in thevery terminology of the Kabbalah. Indeed, in a number of cases, it is only when lookedupon in this sense that some terminology is comprehensible. Thus, for example, theKabbalists call the highest level of transcendence Ayin, literally “Nothingness.”Actually, this alludes to the ultimate level reached by non-directed meditation, whereall perception and imagery cease to exist.Besides being divided into these three basic methods, meditation can be classifiedaccording to the means used. The three basic means are the intellect, the emotions, andthe body.The path of the intellect is very prevalent among the theoretical Kabbalists, and wasalso used outside of the Kabbalistic schools. The most common method was simply tocontemplate on various aspects of the Torah, probing the inner meaning of itscommandments. It also included delving deeply with the intellect into the structure ofthe supernal universes, and, as it were, becoming a denizen of these worlds. For many,this method lead to a very high state of ecstasy, and this method forms the basis of theHabad system of Hasidism.4Another form of intellectual meditation involves the study of devotional works,carefully contemplating each concept in an effort to attain self-improvement. It wasprimarily this method that formed the basis of the Mussar Movement, which arose inthe Nineteenth Century as a response to Hasidism. Such contemplation, or Hitbonenut,plays an especially important role in the devotional work Mesilat Yesharim (Path ofthe Just), by the great Kabbalist Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (1707–1747). In thisremarkable book, the author outlines all the steps leading up to, but not including,Ruach HaKodesh the ultimate enlightment. The method of attaining these desired traitsis that of Hitbonenut–contemplation on the teachings germain to that step andrectifying one's life in the light of these teachings. Incidentally, although it is notwidely known, the ten levels discussed in this text clearly parallel the ten mysticalSefirot of the Kabbalists.The path of the emotions also plays an important role in the systems of theKabbalists. One place where it is particularly important is in Kavanah-meditation, thesystem that makes use of the formal daily prayers as a sort of mantra, especially in the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Hasidic schools. Here one is taught to place all of his feelings and emotions into thewords of his worship, thus attaining a divestment of the physical (hitpashtuthagashmiut). This path is also found in meditations involving music, which played animportant role in the meditations of the ancient prophets of the Bible.A path combining the intellect and emotions is the path of love, described in detailby the leading philosopher, Rabbi Moses Maimonides (1135–1204). He writes thatwhen a person deeply contemplates on God, thinking of His mighty deeds andwondrous creations, he becomes profoundly aware of His wisdom, and is brought to apassionate love for God.5 He speaks of a level of love called Cheshek (passion), wherethe emotion is so intense that every thought is exclusively engaged with its object. Thislove for God can be so intense that the soul can literally be drawn out of the body by it,and this is what occurs when a saint dies by the “Kiss of God.” This is considered to beone of the highest possible levels of enlightenment, usually attained only at veryadvanced age.6The third path is that of the body. It includes both the body motions and breathingexercizes that play a key role in the system of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia. The swayingand bowing that accompanies formal prayer also involves the path of the body,enhancing the meditative uuality of the worship.One of the most important techniques of body meditation involves dancing. This isespecially true among the Hasidic schools, where even after other meditative methodswere abandoned, dance was still used as a means of attaining ecstasy andenlightenment. This, however, was not a Hasidic innovation, since even in mostancient times dance was an important method for attaining enlightenment.The Talmud teaches that on the festival of Succot (Tabernacles), during the“Festival of Drawing,” in Jerusalem, “saints and men of deed would dance before theassemblage, holding torches and singing hymns of praise.”7 This festival was aparticularly propitious time for attaining enlightenment, as the Jerusalem Talmudstates, “Why was it called a ‘Festival of Drawing’? Because it was a time when peopledrew in Ruach HaKodesh.”8 So closely was dance associated with enlightenment, thatthe Future World, which is viewed as the ultimate place of enlightenment, is describedas “A dance conducted by the Blessed Holy One, where each individual points a fingerat Him.”93. VOCABULARYOne reason why so little is known about the various systems of Kabbalah meditationis that all of this literature is in Hebrew, and it has never been accurately translated.Since most of these methods are no longer practiced, the vocabulary associated withthem has also been forgotten. So great is this confusion that even the very Hebrewword for meditation is not generally known. This has even led to the use of the wrong"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"term in an article on the subject in a major Judaic encyclopedia. Once a basicvocabulary is established, however, one can gain an appreciation of how oftenmeditation is discussed in classical texts, particularly in the Kabbalistic classics.10There is one word that is consistently used as a term for meditation by thecommentators, philosophers and Kabbalists. The word which most often denotesmeditation is Hitbodedut (). The verb, “to meditate,” is represented by theword Hitboded ().The word Hitboded is derived from the root Badad (), meaning “to be secluded.”Literally, then, Hitbodedut actually means self isolation, and in some cases, actuallyrefers to nothing more than physical seclusion and isolation.11 In many other places,however, it is used to denote a state of consciousness involving the isolation of theself, that is, the isolation of he individual's most basic essence.Thus, when discussed in a Kabbalistic context, the word Hitbodedut means muchmore than mere physical isolation. It refers to a state of internal isolation, where theindividual mentally secludes his essence from his thoughts. One of the greatestKabbalists, Rabbi Chaim Vital (1543–1620), often speaks of such mental seclusion,saying that “one must seclude himself (hitboded) in his thoughts to the ultimatedegree.”12 In doing this, one separates his soul from his body to such a degree that heno longer feels any relationship to his physical self. The soul is thus isolated, and asRabbi Chaim Vital concludes, “the more one separates himself from the physical, thegreater will be his enlightenment.”This state of mental seclusion is very important to the prophetic experience. Theclearest description of this state is presented by Rabbi Levi ben Gershon (1288–1344),a major Jewish philosopher, often known as Gersonides, or simply by the acrostic, “theRalbag.” He writes that the attainment of prophetic revelation “requires the isolation(hitbodedut) of the consciousness from the imagination, or both of these from the otherperceptive mental faculties.”13Rabbi Isaac of Acco also uses the same definition. Speaking of individuals seekingprophecy, he writes, “They fulfil the conditions of meditation (Hitbodedut) which hasthe effect of nullifying the senses and divorcing the thought porcesses of the soul fromall perception, clothing it in the spiritual essence of the transcendental.”14One of the clearest expressions of this has been developed by Rabbi AbrahamMaimonides (1186–1237), son of the famed Moses Maimonides. He writes that thereare two different types of self isolation (hitbodedut), external and internal. Externalhitbodedut is nothing more than physical isolation, and this is usually desirable whenone wishes to meditate. Internal hitbodedut, on the other hand, consists of isolating thesoul from the perceptive faculty. When the mind is completely hushed in this manner,one becomes able to perceive the spiritual realm.15The word Hitbodedut therefore primarily is used to denote the isolation of the soul"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"or ego from all external and internal stimuli. Any method or practice that is used toaccomplish this is also called Hitbodedut. Since these are the practices that are usuallyreferred to as “meditation,” this is how the word Hitbodedut should be translated.Another closely related term, Hitbonenut (), is also often translated as“meditation.” (Indeed, this is the term used in the above-mentioned encyclopediaarticle.) From context, however, we see that a more precise definition of Hitbonenut is“contemplation,” that is, intense concentration on an object or image. Of course,contemplation is a meditative technique, but it is significant to note that the term ishardly ever used in the classical Kabbalah texts in describing the attainment of thehigher states of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOTalmudic Mystics1. THE TALMUDISTSWith the destruction of Solomon's Temple, the age of the prophets came to a close,and a dark age descended over their heirs. The Biblical canon was sealed, and afterthis, almost no important literature was produced until the time of he Talmud.Although there are some historical records of this period, the most important beingfound in the Apocrypha, virtually no mystical literature exists.Some of the mystical teachings of the prophets had survived, but they were onlytaught in the narrowest circles, and were most probably confined to small secretsocieties. Thus, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, a leader in the First Century, taught, “Theworkings of the Merkava should not be taught even individually, except to one who iswise, understanding with his own knowledge.”1 These mysteries were not publiclytaught, even within the secret societies but were given over individually, to one worthydisciple at a time.The term “Workings of the Merkava,” as used in the Talmud, refers to the mysteryof Ezekiel's vision. Although the term is not found in the vision itself, it does occur inthe verse, “Gold for the pattern of the Chariot (Merkava), the Cherubs” (1 Chronicles2:18). The word Merkava is used to describe the Cherubs on the Ark, but Ezekielhimself identifies the Cherubs as the angels seen in his vision.2The word Merkava () comes from the root Rakhav (), meaning “to ride,”and hence means a “chariot” or “riding vehicle.” In general, the concept of ridinginvolves travelling and leaving one's natural place. When the Bible says that God“rides,” it means that He leaves His natural state where He is absolutely unknowableand inconceivable, and allows Himself to be visualized by the prophets. One who“sees” God in this manner is said to experience a Merkava vision.The term Maaseh Merkava or “Workings of the Merkava” refers to the setting up ofa Merkava, that is, attaining a state where a Merkava vision can be attained. From thecontext in which this term is used in the Kabbalah texts, it is obvious that MaasehMerkava refers to the meditative techniques involved in attaining this mysticalexperience. The Ari explicitly describes an individual involved in the “Workings of theMerkava” as being engaged in meditation (hitbodedut).3 The Hekhalot speaks of theindividual making a “Chariot of Light,” with which he then ascends to the supernalchambers.4"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"These mysteries were entrusted to the religious leaders of each generation. RavZeira, a sage of the Fifth Century, thus taught, “Even a summary of these mysteriesshould be given over only to the chief justice of the court.”5 The chief justices hadmore than mere judicial authority. Each major community had its own ecclesiasticalcourt, and these chief justices were normatively the religious leaders of theircommunities. In order to prevent the mysteries from degenerating into heresy, theywere safeguarded by the religious leadership, and taught individually only to thoseconsidered worthy.Among the early mystical schools, there is a group that the Talmud crypticallyrefers to as the “First Hasidim.” Among the things that the Talmud says, about them isthat they were zealous in bringing sacrifice, and scrupulously buried refuse containingsharp objects so as not to cause harm to others.6 According to Rabbi Chaim Vital, theseFirst Hasidim were among the important heirs to the prophetic tradition.7The Mishnah states that “the First Hasidim would linger an hour and then pray.” Tothis, the Talmud adds that they would also wait an hour after their prayers, and that theprayer itself would also take an hour.8 Since there were three daily prayer services,they would spend a total of nine hours each day involved in such devotion.There is no mention in the Talmud as to what these Hasidim did during the hoursbefore and after prayer, but the Kabbalists explain it in terms of classical meditativetechniques.9 In order to place oneself in the frame of mind necessary for successfuldeep meditation, one must sit calmly beforehand, quietly building up spiritual energy.Similarly, after intense meditation, one must also sit quietly, absorbing the effects ofths experience. This would then clearly indicate that the prayer itself was used as atype of meditation among these First Hasidim.This is actually easy to understand. In the time of Ezra, shortly after the close ofprophecy, the Great Assembly had composed the Eighteen Blessings, a prayer that wasto be recited three times daily. This was the prayer said by the First Hasidim. Recitedeach day, three times, this prayer itself became almost like a mantra. While the wordscould be said almost automatically, the mind became totally absorbed by the words,inducing a very deep meditative state. The intensity of their concentration is evident,since the Eighteen Blessings can normally be recited in two or three minutes, and theFirst Hasidim spent an entire hour on them.Most types of Merkava meditation involved the use of Divine Names. As far back asthe time of Hillel, a leader in the First Century b.c.e., we find warnings against usingsuch Names for one's own purposes. Hillel thus taught, “He who makes use of theCrown will pass away.”10 A very early source interprets this to refer to one who makesuse of God's names for his own purposes.11One of the earliest names associated with the Merkava school is that of RabbiYochanan ben Zakkai. While he is said to have been completely versed in all aspects of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the tradition, both mystical and otherwise, he was still considered among the leastdisciples of Hillel. The greatest of Hillel's disciples, Rabbi Jonathan ben Uziel, was themystic par excellence, but very little is know of his life. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai,on the other hand, is a well-known figure in the Talmud, and a vast majority of itslegalistic material is derived from the school that Rabbi Yochanan founded in Yavnehafter the destruction of the Second Temple in the year 70.Rabbi Jonathan ben Uziel is mentioned only a few times in the Talmud, but iscredited with having authored the Targum, the authorized Aramaic translation, to thebooks of the Prophets. It is in this context that we see that he had a direct traditionregarding the mystical teachings of the prophets embodied in their books, and was thusone of the greatest students of the esoteric tradition in his generation.Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai was the most important religious leader after thedestruction of the Second Temple. Among his major disciples were the Great RabbiEliezer, Rabbi Joshua, and Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh, who were counted as the greatestsages and religious leaders of their time. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai taught them themysteries of the Merkava, but did not take these teachings lightly, going to greatlengths to teach his disciples proper respect for them.The Talmud tells us that the main one to whom Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai taughtthe mysteries was Rabbi Joshua, who in turn taught it to Rabbi Akiba.12 Besides beingthe greatest religious leader of his generation, and one of its supreme logicians, RabbiAkiba was also one of the leading mystics of his time. The Talmud tells how, alone ofthe four greatest sages of his generation, he was able to penetrate the deepest mysteriesand remain unscathed.There are some mystical books attributed to Rabbi Akiba and his school, the mostprominent being Otiot deRabbi Akiba (The Letters of Rabbi Akiba), which discussesthe mystery of the letters of the alphabet. Some also attribute to Rabbi Akiba thepresent recension of Sefer Yetzira (The Book of Formation), one of the most importantand mystical classics of the Kabbalah.As an adept in the science of meditation, we would expect to find Rabbi Akibafamiliar with the various manifestations of the higher states of consciousness. Animportant experience in high meditative states is synesthesia, where sound is seen andcolors are heard. On the verse, “And all the people saw the voices” (Exodus 20:15),Rabbi Akiba states that they saw the sounds and heard visions, a clear example ofsynesthesia.13 Since Rabbi Akiba was able to speak of this state, it is also highlyprobable that he experienced it.SOURCESHillel had eighty disciples. . . .

A heavenly voice (bat kol) declared, “Who is it who reveales Mymysteries to man?”Jonathan ben Uziel stood on his feet and said, “It is revealed and known before Youthat I have not done this for my own glory, nor for the glory of my father's house. Ihave done it for Your glory so that controversy not increase in Israel.”Talmud15It happened that Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai was on a journey, riding on a donkey.His disciple, Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh, who was driving the donkey, said, “Master,teach me a lesson in the Workings of the Merkava.”Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said, “Did I not teach you that the Workings of theMerkava may not even be taught individually, except to one who is wise,understanding from his own knowledge?”The other replied, “Then let me repeat something that you have already taught me.”Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai immediately got down from the donkey, wrappedhimself in his Tallit, and sat on a stone under an olive tree.The disciple asked, “Rabbi, why did you get down?”The master replied, “Is it then proper that you should expound on the Workings ofthe Merkava, when the Divine Presence joins us and angels are all around, while I amsitting on a donkey?”Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh then began to expound on the Workings of the Merkava.Fire came down and surrounded all the trees of the field. . . .When this was told to Rabbi Joshua, he was on a journey together with Rabbi Yosithe Priest.

Rabbi Akiba warned them, “When you enter near the stones of puremarble, do not say ‘water water,’ since it is written, ‘He who speaks falsehood will notbe established before My eyes’ (Psalms 101:7).Ben Azzai gazed and died. Ragarding him it is written, “Precious in God's eyes isthe death of His saints” (Psalms 116:15).Ben Zoma gazed and was stricken. Regarding him it is written, “You have foundhoney, eat moderately lest you bloat yourself and vomit it” (Proverbs 25:16).The Other (Elisha ben Abuya) gazed and cut his plantings (became a heretic).Rabbi Akiba entered in peace and left in peace. . . .The angels also wished to cast down Rabbi Akiba but the Blessed Holy One said,“Leave this elder alone, for he is worthy of making use of My glory.”Talmud17Entered the Orchard: They ascended to heaven by means of a [Divine] Name.Pure Marble: As transparent as clear water.Do not say ‘water water': is here and how can we procede?’Ben Zoma gazed: toward the Divine Presence (Shekhinah). And was stricken: He losthis mind.Precious in God's eyes is the death of His saints: This death is harsh in His eyes,since [Ben Azzai] died unmarried. Still, it is impossible that he should not have died,since it is written, “No man can see Me and live” (Exodus 33:20).Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki-Yarchi(Rashi: 1040–1105), Commentary ad loc.They did not physically ascend, but it appeared to them as if they had ascended onhigh.Tosafot (Twelfth Century),Commentary ad loc.[The Sages] use the term “Orchard” (Pardes, Paradise) to denote the Garden of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Eden, the place set aside for the righteous. It is the place in Aravot (the highest heaven)where the souls of the righteous are stored.18In the Hekhalot it is explained that sages who were worthy of such undertakingswould pray and purify themselves of all uncleanliness. They would fast, immerse [inthe Mikvah] and purify themselves. Then they would make use of various Names andgaze into the Chambers [on high]. There they would see how the watches of angelsstand. They would see how one Chamber follows another, and what is in eachChamber.Rabbi Akiba warned them, “When you gaze into the profound depths (avanta, )of your heart, approaching the stones of pure marble, do not say, ‘water water.’” Thereis actually no water there at all, but only a form is seen. If one says there is water there,he is blaspheming.This is explained in Hekhalot Rabatai.19 The Watcher of the Chamber of the MarbleDoor casts forth thousands upon thousands of waves of water, but actually not even asingle drop is there. Rabbi Akiba says, “It appears as if the waves are of water, butthere is actually not even a single drop. All that one sees is the glow in the air from thestones of pure marble, which are included in the Chamber. Their radiance resembleswater. But if one says, ‘What is the purpose of this water,’ he is a blasphemer.”They did not actually ascend into heaven, but gazed and saw it in the profounddepths of the heart. They saw it like one gazing through a dull mirror.20Ben Azzai gazed. This means that he continued uttering Divine Names so as to beable to see in a clear mirror, and as a result he died.Ben Zomah gazed and was stricken, that is, he lost his mind.The Other cut his plantings. Since the place is called an Orchard, the sages say thathe “cut his plantings.” This means that he blasphemed. He saw [the angel] Metatron,who was given authority to sit for one hour to inscribe the merit of Israel. He said, “Ihave learned that it is not permitted to sit in that place on high. Perhaps there are twoAuthorities.”Rabbi Chananel ben Chushiel (990s—1055),Commentary ad loc.The sages taught that four entered the Orchard. In the Greater and Lesser Hekhalot,it is explained that they engaged in certain practices, uttered prayers in purity, and“made use of the Crown.”21 They were then able to gaze at the Chambers. . . .This does not mean that they actually ascended on high, but that they gazed and sawit in the chambers of their heart, viewing it just like something seen clearly with theeyes.

One must first fast for a certain number of days. He then places his head betweenhis knees, and whispers into the ground many songs and praises known from tradition.From his innermost being and its chambers he will then perceive the SevenChambers. In his vision, it will be as if he is entering one chamber after another,gazing at what is in each one.There are two tractates in which this is taught. These are called the Greater Hekhalotand the Lesser Hekhalot, as is well known.It is with regard to such an experience that the Talmud teaches, “Four entered theOrchard.” The chambers are likened to an orchard and are given this name. The fourwho entered the Merkava and passed through the Chambers are likened to peopleentering an orchard. . . .It is taught that Ben Azzai gazed and died. This is because it was his time to leavethe world.It is also taught that Ben Zoma gazed and was stricken. This means that he becameinsane because of the confounding visions that his mind could not tolerate. He was likethe “stricken ones,” regarding which the 91st Psalm was written.23When the Talmud states that the Other “cut his plantings,” it is again using theallegory of the orchard. Since one of the four did irreparable damage, he is likened toone who enters an orchard and cuts down its trees. The Other assumed that there aretwo Authorities, very much like the Magii, who believe in Ormuzd and Ahriman, aswell as independent domains of good and evil, like light and darkness.24 This is theintent of the Talmud.Rabbi Akiba was the most perfect of them all. He gazed properly, not exceeding hislimitations, and his mind was able to encompass these mighty confounding visions.God gave him power so that as long as he gazed he kept proper thoughts in his mindand maintained a proper mental state.This was known to all the early sages and none denied it. They maintained that Godwould accomplish wonders and fearsome things through the saints, just as He didthrough the prophets. . . . .They do not deny the Talmudical accounts of miracles, suchas those involving Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa and the like.25When Mar Rav Samuel Gaon [who headed the academy between 730 and 748 c.e.]and others like him flourished, they began to read the books of the philosophers.

THE ZOHARAmong the disciples of Rabbi Akiba, the most prominent mystic was Rabbi Shimonbar Yochai, best known as the author of the Zohar. Although Rabbi Shimon obviouslyreceived a good part of the mystical tradition from Rabbi Akiba, he was not consideredhis prime disciple in this area. This honor was reserved for a colleague of RabbiShimon), Rabbi Chananya ben Chanikai.27With Rabbi Shimon, however, a new school was developed. The account of RabbiShimon's thirteen-year stay in a cave with his son, hiding from the Roman officials, iswell known. Rabbi Shimon had denounced the Romans and had been sentenced todeath, barely escaping to this cave. During his stay there, Rabbi Shimon engaged inesoteric meditations and prayers, until he was worthy of a mystical revelation of theprophet Elijah. Elijah taught him the deepest of mysteries, which were later to make upthe main body of the Zohar.Rabbi Shimon left the cave around the year 138, shortly after the death of Hadrian,and established a new school of mysticism. This school continued after his death, andsome seventy years later, his disciples wrote down his main teachings, forming themain body of the Zohar. These later writings were distinguished from the “firstMishnah,” which was written by Rabbi Shimon himself.28Rabbi Shimon's school survived for many years, during which minor additions weremade to the Zoharic literature. For over a thousand years, this body of literatureconsisted of volumes of notes, restricted to a very small secret society. With the finaldisbandment of this society, the manuscripts were hidden in a vault, and were notuncovered until the Thirteenth Century. They finally came to the hands of RabbiMoshe de Leon, one of the most prominent Kabbalists of that time, and he finallyedited and published them in the 1290's. Enough was known of the Zoharic literatureby the Kabbalists of that generation to recognize it as being authentic, and it wasaccepted by them with virtually no controversy.There has always been some question as to the authenticity of the Zohar, especiallyamong secular historians and opponents of the Kabbalah. Some even claim that RabbiMoshe de Leon was its actual author. The main basis of this allegation is an account byanother prominent Kabbalist of the time, Rabbi Isaac of Acco. He writes that he wentto visit Rabbi Moshe to see the original manuscripts of the Zohar, but by the time hearrived, he found that Rabbi Moshe had passed away. He was informed that the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"manuscripts had never existed, and that Rabbi Moshe himself was the actual author ofthe Zohar. It is upon this account that most of the speculation regarding medievalauthorship of the Zohar is based.There are, however, strong questions regarding the veracity of the story told toRabbi Isaac. It is well known that the ignorant often destroyed manuscripts, or onoccasion, sold them so that the parchment could be reused. It is quite possible that thewife did this, and then embarrassed at not having them, claimed that they neverexisted. What is most important, however, is the fact that Rabbi Isaac of Accoinvestigated the matter, determined to ascertain the truth. Although the exact results ofhis investigation are not known, it is obvious that he eventually accepted theauthenticity of the Zohar. This will be discussed at greater length in the section onRabbi Isaac of Acco.On its face, the Zohar contains virtually nothing regarding the methods of mysticalmeditation. It does contain many allusions of names and letter permutations, but doesnot provide a key as to how they should be used. It remained for the Ari to open thedoor of the Zohar, and demonstrate how its methods are to be used.Excerpts fromTHE ZOHAR[After the death of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai,] Rabbi Chiyah prostrated himself onthe earth and kissed the ground. He cried out and said, “Dust, dust, how stiffnecked youare! How brazen you are! The most desirable things decay in you. You consume andpulverize all the world's pillars of light. How dastardly you are! The holy light whoilluminated the world, the great master who oversaw the community, in whose meritthe world stood, is now decaying in you.”“O Rabbi Shimon, shining lamp, light of the world, you are decaying in the dust. Butyou are still alive, directing the community.”He was astounded for an instant. Then he said, “Dust, dust, be not proud! The pillarsof the world will not be given over to you. For Rabbi Shimon is not decaying in you.”When Rabbi Chiyah rose, he was crying. He left, and Rabbi Yosi went along withhim. He fasted for forty days so that he should be able to see Rabbi Shimon, but he wastold, “You are not worthy to see him.” He wept and then fasted for another forty days.He was then shown a vision. He saw Rabbi Shimon and his son Eliezer studying aconcept that he had discussed with Rabbi Yosi. Many thousands were listening to hiswords.At that moment, he saw many great lofty Wings. Rabbi Shimon and his son Eliezermounted them, they ascended to the Academy of the Heavens. While they were there,the Wings waited for them.He then saw [Rabbi Shimon and his son Eliezer] returning. They shone with a"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"renewed glory, brighter than the sun.Rabbi Shimon opened and said, “Let Rabbi Chiyah enter. Let him see to what extentthe Blessed Holy One will renew the faces of the righteous in the World to Come.Happy is he who comes here without shame. Happy is he who can stand in this worldlike a mighty pillar.”[Rabbi Chiyah then] saw [himself] enter. Rabbi Eliezer was standing, and all theothers who were sitting there [stood up before Rabbi Chiyah] He was very ashamed,but he entered, going to the side and sitting at the feet of Rabbi Shimon.A Voice was heard, proclaiming, “Lower your eyes. Do not raise your head. Do notgaze.” He lowered his eyes, but saw a light shining at a great distance.The Voice came back as before, and said, “O you on high, who are hidden andconcealed, open your eyes. O you who fly through all the worlds, gaze and see. O youwho sleep with sealed eyes down below, wake up.“Who among you has transformed darkness into light or bitterness into sweetnessbefore he came here? Who among you waited each day for the light that shines whenthe King visits the Doe? For it is at this time that the Glory is increased, and He iscalled King over all the kings of the world. One who does not look forward to this eachday in the world below has no portion here.”At that instant, [Rabbi Chiyah] saw a number of the group surrounding all thestanding pillars, and he saw them being elevated to the Heavenly Academy. Some wereascending while others were descending. And above them all, was the Master ofWings.29He made an oath and heard from behind the barrier that each day the Kingremembers the Doe who lies in the dust and visits her.30 At that time, He kicks out at390 firmaments, and they all are confounded and tremble before Him. He sheds tearsbecause of this, and those tears, boiling like fire, fall into the great sea. The tearsremain and endure there, and as a result of their power, the Master of the Sea is able tosanctify the Name of the Holy King. He accepts upon himself to swallow up all thewaters of creation, and gather them into himself. Then, all peoples will come togetherto the Holy People, and the waters will be dried up so that they will be able to passover on dry land.While this was happening, he heard a voice proclaiming, “Make way, make way, forthe King, the Messiah, is coming to the academy of Rabbi Shimon.”(All the righteous are heads of the academies on high, and all the earthly academieshave their counterparts there. All the fellows of each academy ascend from their ownschool to the Heavenly Academy. The Messiah comes into all these academies, sealingTorah from the lips of the sages.)At that moment, the Messiah came to [the academy of Rabbi Shimon]. He waswearing the highest crowns, given to him by the heads of the academies."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"All the fellows stood up and Rabbi Shimon also rose, with his light ascending to theheights of the Firmament. [The Messiah] said to him, “O Rabbi, happy are you. YourTorah teachings ascend with 370 lights, and each light separates into 613 meanings.31These rise and are immersed in a river of pure balsamum. The Blessed Holy One sealsTorah from your academy, as well as from the academy of Hezekiah king of Judah, andfrom the academy of Ahiyah the Shilonite.32“I did not come to seal Torah from your academy, but only because the Master ofWings came here. I know that he does not enter any academy other than yours.”Rabbi Shimon then told him of the oath uttered by the Master of Wings. TheMessiah lifted his voice and trembled. The firmaments, the great sea, and theLeviathan all trembled, and it seemed as if the world would be overturned.At that moment [the Messiah] saw Rabbi Chiyah sitting at the feet of Rabbi Shimon.He said, “Who allowed a person wearing the clothing of the physical world to comehere?”Rabbi Shimon replied, “He is Rabbi Chiyah, the shining light of the Torah.”[The Messiah] said, “Let him and his sons die so that they can enter your academy.”Rabbi Shimon responded, “Let him be given more time [on earth].He was then given additional time. He left that place, trembling, with tearsstreaming from his eyes. Rabbi Chiyah trembled, wept and said, “Happy is the portionof the righteous in that world. And happy is the portion of the son of Yochai, who isworthy of all that.”Zohar 1:4aRabbi Abba said:One day I came to a city of the people of the East, and they told me some wisdomthat they had inherited from ancient times. They also had books explaining thiswisdom, and they brought me one such book.In this book it was written that when a person meditates in this world, a spirit(ruach) is transmitted to him from on high. The type of spirit depends on the desire towhich he attaches himself. If his mind attaches itself to something lofty and holy, thenthat is what he transmits down to himself. But if his mind attaches itself to the OtherSide, and he meditates on this, then that will be what he transmits down to himself.They said, “It all depends on word, deed, and the individual's desire to attachhimself. Through these, he transmits downward to himself that side to which hebecomes attached.”In that book I found all the [idolatrous] rites and practices involved in the worshipof the stars and constellations. It included the things needed for such rites, as well asinstructions how one must meditate in order to transmit their [influence] to himself.In the same manner, one who wishes to attach himself on high through Ruach"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"HaKodesh must do so with deed, word, and desire of the heart, meditating in that area.This is what it depends on when on wishes to bind himself to something and transmitits influence to himself. . . .I said to them, “My children, the things in that book are very close to the teachingsof the Torah. But you must keep yourselves from these books in order that your heartsnot be drawn to their [idolatrous] practices and all the [other] facets mentioned there,and lest you be drawn away from serving the Blessed Holy One.”All these books can confuse a person. This is because the people of the East weregreat sages, who inherited this wisdom from Abraham. He had given it to the sons ofhis concubines, as it is written, “To the sons of the concubines that Abraham had taken,Abraham gave gifts” (Genesis 25:6).33 [This was originally true wisdom] but later itwas drawn into many [idolatrous] sides.Zohar 1:99b.Happy is he who elevates his faith in God, taking te Divine Presence, which consistsof Ten Sayings, and placing it in a single thought, a single desire, without anyadmixture whatsoever. Each and every Sefirah (Divine Emanation) is planted in it, andit is the Garden in which all the Sefirot are one. . . .34When a person wishes to unify the Blessed Holy One and His Divine Presence (themale and female aspects of the Divine), he must banish all other thoughts. [Suchthoughts] are the Klipot (, Husks), regarding which it is written, “There are manythoughts in the heart of man” (Proverbs 19:21). One must then bring the DivinePresence into his mind, as the verse continues, “But the counsel of God will abide.”When a man comes together with his wife, he must remove all clothing, to betogether with her as one, as it is written, “They shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:21). In asimilar manner, one must remove all other [thoughts, which serve as the soul's]garments, when he makes the Unification twice each day, declaring, “Hear O Israel,God is our Lord, God is One” (Deuteronomy 6:4).35Tikuney Zohar 66 (98a).This is the mystery of Unification (Yichud, ). The individual who is worthy ofthe World to Come must unify the name of the Blessed Holy One. He must unify theupper and lower levels and limbs, uniting them all and bringing them all to thenecessary place, where the knot can be bound.36This is the mystery of, “Hear O Israel, God is our Lord, God is One.”The mystery of “Hear” (Sh'ma, ) is the Name (Shem, ) which becomes seventy(Eyin, ) names.This is the unifying category, Israel. It is called the Elder Israel (Yisrael Sabba),since there is also a lesser [Israel]. Regarding [the latter] it is written, “Israel is a child"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"and I will love him” (Hosea 11:1). But [the one alluded to in “Hear O Israel] is theElder Israel.[This Elder Israel is] a single mystery and a single unifying category. “Hear OIsrael” thus includes the [supernal archetype] Female and her Husband.After the two are included in each other, in a single unifying category [which is theElder Israel] one must unify their limbs. One must combine the two Tabernacles,making them into one in every limb.This unification is accomplished when one meditates and ascends, attaching himselfto the Infinite Being (Ain Sof, ). It is here that all things, both on high and below,are bound together in a single desire.This is the mystery of “Will Be” (YiHYeH, ), in the verse “God will be (Yihyeh)One” (Zechariah 14:9). It means that [He “will be One”] in the mystery of YiHYeH.The Yod () must be attached to the Heh () to make YH (). This is the InnerChamber [since these are the first two letters of the Tetragrammaton, YHVH ()].This is the place that conceals the highest point, which is the Yod ().This is the mystery of “God is our Lord.” The two Divine Names represent theletters Yod () and Heh ().One must then include all limbs in the place from which they emanate, this beingthe Inner Chamber. One brings them back to their place in their essence, foundationand root, elevating them to the place that is the Root of the Covenant.Then one must concentrate on the second pair of letters [in YiHYeH ()]. He mustbind [the second] Yod () to [the second] Heh ().Yod is the mystery of the Holy Covenant. Heh is the Chamber, the place in whichthe Holy Covenant, which is the Yod, is concealed. And even though we have stated[elsewhere] that this is the Vav () [in the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, (),] here it is aYod. The mystery is that the two are united as one.“[God is] One.” This indicates that one must take everything from there and aboveand unify them as one.One must elevate the mind so as to bind them all in one knot, and then, one mustelevate the mind with awe and love until it reaches the Infinite Being (Ain Sof). At thesame time, however, one must not allow the mind to leave all the other levels andlimbs. But the mind should ascend with all of them, binding them so that all of themare a single knot in the Infinite Being (Ain Sof).This is the Unification (Yichud) of the Elder Rav Hamnuna. He learned it from hisfather, and his father learned it from his master, who had a tradition from the lips ofthe Prophet Elijah.Zohar 2:216a.3. THE HEKHALOT SCHOOL"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Another important mystical school was headed by Rabbi Nehuniah ben Hakaneh, amysterious personality about whose life virtually nothing is known. A contemporary ofRabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, he flourished in the First Century, living to extreme oldage. In one Talmudical account, we find him in the presence of Rabbi Yochanan benZakkai when the latter was asking his disciples to interpret a certain Biblical passage.When Rabbi Nehunia gave his opinion, Rabbi Yochanan declared that it was betterthan his own.37 The true stature of Rabbi Nehuniah becomes evident in the Hekhalot,where we find the greatest sages of that generation sitting at his feet as disciples. It isquite evident that he was the greatest esoteric master of his time.It is from Rabbi Nehuniah that we have the Bahir, one of the oldest of allKabbalistic texts. It is in this book that we find the earliest discussion of the Sefirot, aswell as the doctrine of reincarnation. Although no details are given as to how they areto be used, a number of esoteric Names are discussed, as well as the general concept of“descending to the Merkava.”The Bahir states that it is impossible to become involved in the Merkava withoutfalling into error, but that one should pursue it nonetheless, since it leads to the “wayof life.”38 The reason why the mystics call it “descending to the Merkava” is becauseone's vantage point is the highest level of thought, from which one must actuallydescend to visualize the mysteries of the Merkava.39The most important disciple of Rabbi Nehuniah was Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, whoserved as High Priest in the last days of the Second Temple. The Talmud relates howRabbi Ishmael learned from Rabbi Nehuniah how to derive lessons from every word inthe Torah, no matter how insignificant.40 But most important, Rabbi Ishmael was theprime disciple in areas of mystical meditation, and it is from him that most sourceshave survived.In one place, the Talmud provides us with an example of Rabbi Ishmael's mysticalexperience, where he sees “Akhteriel Yah the Lord of Hosts sitting on a high andexalted throne.” The association of an angel, Akhteriel (), with God's name issomewhat difficult to understand. This is a very important point, however, sincesimilar expressions occur many times in the early mystical writings, particulary in theHekhalot.In the commentaries, there appears to be some confusion as to whether Akhteriel isthe name of an angel, or an appelation of the Glory itself. This can be understood,however, in terms of the teaching that prophecy and vision must always come throughan lspaklaria () which is translated to mean a mirror or a lens. Although theinitiate actually perceives God's Glory, it is not seen directly, but must be reflectedthrough the lspaklaria. The lspaklaria can be an angel or some other transcendentalbeing, and in this case, it was the angel Akhteriel.41The same is true whenever an angel's name precedes that of God in mystical"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"literature. This merely means that the angel is serving as the lens or mirror for thevision, or as God's spokesman. In many places in the Bible we find that an angelspeaks in God's name, and this is the inner meaning of what God said regarding anangel, “My Name is in him” (Exodus 23:11).42 This angel is usually identified asMetatron (), and regarding this angel, the Talmud says, “his name is like that ofhis Master.”43Elsewhere, the Talmud relates that Rabbi Ishmael said, “Suriel, Prince of the Face,spoke to me.”44 The name of the angel Suriel or Suriah occurs many times in theHekhalot, and this angel is seen to be a spokesman for the “Face.” From all thesesources, it is obvious that Rabbi Ishmael was accustomed to such visions.From these earlier generations, the esoteric tradition was given over to Rabbi Judahthe Prince (120–189), who is best known as the redactor of the Mishnah, the earliestpart of the Talmud.45 From him it was given over to Rabbi Yochanan, redactor of theJerusalem Talmud, and then to his disciple, Rabbi Assi. The tradition finally reachedRav Joseph and Rav Zeira, both of whom were versed in the mysteries of the Merkava.The mysteries were therefore in the hand of the Talmudic sages, and were in use untilthe middle of the Fifth Century.46Rabbi Chaim Vital points out that many practices involving the use of DivineNames cannot be successful unless the initiate has been purified with the ashes of theRed Heifer. This is an important teaching of the Ari, mentioned a number of times inhis writings. The Red Heifer was a special sacrifice, discussed in detail in Numbers 19,and it is the only means through which defilement resulting from contact with a deadbody can be removed.The main need for the Red Heifer arose because one was not permitted to enter theTemple grounds while in a defiled state. If a person had ever come in contact with thedead, he would have to be purified with the ashes of the Red Heifer before he couldenter the sanctuary. Similarly, those engaged in the esoteric practices could not recitethe Divine Names unless they were first purified in this manner.The Red Heifer was a type of sacrifice, however, and sacrifice could only be offeredwhen the Temple stood. When the Temple was destroyed in the year 70, only a smallquantity of the ashes remained, and as long as these were still available, suchpurification was possible. The last of these ashes were used up in the Fifth Century,and after that, the method of Divine Names outlined in the Hekhalot could no longer beused.This is verified by an account in the Hekhalot itself, where Rabbi Ishmael and RabbiAkiba wished to bring Rabbi Nehuniah out of his mystical state. They did so bytouching him with a cloth that had come in contact with a menstruous woman, andimmediately upon touching this cloth, he was dismissed from before the Throne ofGlory. Similarly, an individual who has not cleansed himself of all spiritual and ritual"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"defilement, including the purification of the Red Heifer, cannot enter into thesemysteries. The Hekhalot clearly spells out the dangers waiting for those who are notproperly prepared and attempt to enter the Merkava.SOURCESRabbi Ishmael said: I once entered the innermost chamber [of the Holy of Holies] toburn incense [on Yom Kippur] I saw Akhteriel Yah the Lord of Hosts () sitting on a high and exalted throne. He said to me, “Ishmael,My son, bless Me.”I replied, “May it be Your will that You withhold Your anger, and let Your mercy berevealed over Your attributes. May You deal with Your children with the attribute ofMercy, and enter with them beyond the call of the Law.”He then nodded His head.Talmud.47Rabbi Ishmael said: I was thirteen years old when I went to study with RabbiNehuniah ben Hakanah. I asked him, “Who is the Prince of the Torah,” and he replied,“His name is Yofiel ().”I was already fasting, but I decided to increase my mortification. I separated myselffrom all enjoyment for an additional forty days, beyond my previous fasts. At the endof the forty days, I pronounced the Great Name and brought down [the angel Yofiel].He descended in a flaming fire, and his face was like a flash of lightning. When I sawhim, I trembled and was confounded. My limbs seemed to dismember themselves, andI fell over backward.He said to me, “Son of man, how dare you agitate the great Assembly on high?”I fortified myself and replied, “It is known and revealed before the One who spokeand brought the world into being that I did not bring you down to earth for my ownhonor, but only to do the will of your Master.”He immediately said to me, “Son of man, you putrid drop, you worm, you maggot!Even if your soul has begun [to purify itself], you are still attached to a defiled body. Ifyou wish that I reveal myself to you, fast for forty days, and immerse yourself twenty-four times each day. Do not taste anything that causes an odor, nor eat any kind ofbeans or vegetables. Sit in a dark room and do not look at any woman.After I had done this, he taught me a Divine Name, with which I would ascend anddescend.Midrash.48Rabbi Akiba related that he asked Rabbi Eliezer the Great, “How does one bind theAngel of the Face (Sar HaPanim) by an oath so that he should come down to earth andreveal the mysteries of things above and below?”"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"He replied to me, “My son, I once brought him down, and he wanted to destroy theworld.

Through the knowledge that he willreveal to me, I will oblige him and learn from him.”He replied, “If one wishes to oblige himself, he should sit fasting for the entire daywhen he brings him down. Before that day, he should purify himself for seven days[with the ashes of the Red Heifer], He should immerse himself in a stream of water,and not speak any idle words.“At the end of these days of fasting and purification, he should sit in water up to hisneck. Before binding [the angel] with an oath, he should say, I bind you by an oath,princes of pride and terror, who are appointed to strike down one who is not pure andclean and who dares to reach out to make use of the servants on high. I do this throughthe glorious and fearsome Name. . . .”Razo Shel Sandelfon.49[There are four universes, Atzilut (Nearness), the universe of the Sefirot, Beriyah(Creation), the universe of the Throne, Yetzirah (Formation), the universe of angels,and Asiyah (Making), the universe of forms.]The prophets were able to see into Atzilut, although it was completely clothed in thelights of Beriyah when they saw it. Ezekiel lived after the destruction [of Solomon'sTemple], and he therefore only received prophecy from Atzilut after it was clothed inBeriyah, with Beriyah itself clothed entirely in Yetzirah.After this, the lights of Atzilut and Beriyah were no longer revealed at all. This is themeaning of the teaching that after Hagai, Zechariah and Malachi, prophecy endedcompletely, and only Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) remained.50[This Ruach HaKodesh] consists of a transmission of the lights of Yetzirah itself, aswell as lower levels. Attaining this level is called “Ascending to the Orchard(Pardes).”51 This refers to Yetzirah, which is called “the Universe of [the angel]Metatron.”There are given techniques through which one can open the gates of the physicalworld so as to enter Asiyah and Yetzirah. These consist of Unifications (Yechudim) andprayers pertaining to the Universe of Yetzirah and its Ten Sefirot. It is these techniquesthat are taught in the Chapters of Hekhalot, and these practices were used by RabbiNehuniah, Rabbi Akiba, Rabbi Ishmael, and the members of the Great Assembly.These techniques were then forgotten. Besides this, the ashes of the Red Heifer werelost in the period of the later Talmudic sages (Amaraim), during the generation of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Abaya and Rava [who lived in the Fifth Century], as mentioned in the Talmud.52 Afterthis, they no longer made use of these techniques to ascend to the Orchard.From then on, people only made use of techniques involving the universe of Asiyah.Since this is the lowest of the universes, its angels have only a little good, and aremostly evil. Besides this, this is a level where good and evil are closely intertwined[and it is very difficult to separate them]. This does not bring any enlightenment, sinceit is impossible to perceive good alone, and one's perception is therefore a combinationof good and evil, truth and falsehood.This is the significance of the Practical Kabbalah. It is forbidden to make use of it,since evil necessarily attaches itself to the good. One may actually intend to cleansehis soul, but as a result of the evil, he actually defiles it.Even if one does gain some perception, it is truth intermingled with falsehood. Thisis especially true today, since the ashes of the Red Heifer no longer exist. [Since onecannot purify himself,] the uncleanliness of the Husks (Klipot) attaches itself to theindividual who attempts to gain enlightenment through the Practical Kabbalah.Therefore, “he who watches his soul should keep far from them.”53 For besidespolluting his soul, he will also be punished in purgatory (Gehinom). We also have atradition that such an individual will be punished in this world. Either he or hischildren will become sick, will be impoverished, or will become apostates. Learn alesson from Joseph Della Reina and Rabbi Shlomo Molcho, who made use of thePractical Kabbalah and were destroyed from the world.All this is because of the above-mentioned reason. This involves a realm wherethere is no good devoid of evil. Besides this, it involves coercing angels with oathsagainst their will. These angels retaliate by enticing this individual, drawing him intoevil ways until his soul is destroyed.Beyond this, the methods involving these oaths were concealed by earliergenerations, and we are not well-versed in the proper techniques. One must thereforekeep himself far from these things.Rabbi Chaim Vital (1543-1620).544. THE HEKHALOT TEXTThe Greater Hekhalot is one of the most ancient of all mystical texts, dating back tothe First Century. It is also one of the few ancient tracts that explicitly describe themethods through which one enters the mystical state. The key appears to be a type ofmantra meditation where a series of Divine Names is repeated 112 times. Through therepetition of this formula, one enters the threshold of the mystical Chambers, and onemust then proceed from one Chamber to the next.The ascent through the Chambers seems to be a sort of spiritual projection. Onecreates for himself a spiritual “body,” and with the hands of this “body,” he holds the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Seals that must be shown to the angels guarding each gate in order to gain admittance.Since the initiate is ascending mentally rather than physically, these Seals must also bemental images of the Names in question.The most probable meaning is that one must concentrate on these names, andpossibly depict them in his mind. If this is the case, then this method would be veryclosely related to the method of Unifications (Yichudim) taught by the Ari. In theselection just quoted, Rabbi Chaim Vital states that the initiate would make use ofUnifications in his ascent.When one reaches the step before the seventh and final chamber, he is placed in achariot (Karon, ). It should be recalled that the general word for this type ofmystical experience is Merkava, which also means a chariot. The Merkava is aspiritual vehicle that one creates for himself, with which he ascends into the mysticalstate.Also of great interest is the interpretation given to the Nogah (, glow) andChashmal () seen in Ezekiel's vision. These are mentioned in the verse, “I saw,and behold a stormy wind coming from the north, a great cloud and flashing fire, aGlow (nogah) round about, and from its midst, a vision of the Speaking Silence(Chashmal), in the midst of the fire” (Ezekiel 1:4). These two concepts are importantelements in the ascent into the transcendental realm.In the Hekhalot, we find that the person descending into the Merkava is the firstcarried away by a stormy wind (sa'arah, ). This is the same stormy wind that liftedup Elijah, described in the verse, “There appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,which separated the two, and Elijah went into heaven in a stormy wind (sa'arah)” (2Kings 2:11). This is also obviously the “stormy wind” described by Ezekiel at thebeginning of his vision. He is then brought upward in a chariot of Nogah, This beingthe glow seen by Ezekiel. The Nogah that Ezekiel saw was therefore the vehicle thatbrings the initiate into the heavenly realm.Finally, when he is about to enter the highest levels of the Merkava the initiate istested by the Chashmal to see if he is worthy. This fits very well into the Kabbalisticteaching that the Chashmal is the spiritual element that forms a barrier between goodand evil, preventing evil from treading on the domain of the Holy.55 In the Hekhalot itis also the final barrier, excluding all who have not purified themselves sufficiently.Crucial to the entire process is a precise knowledge of the names of the angels, aswell as the various formulas and seals needed to ascend from one chamber to the next.Here, unfortunately, we are faced with a serious difficulty, since these exhibitconsiderable variation in different manuscripts and printed texts of the Hekhalot, and itis impossible to determine which versions are correct. The only way to do this wouldbe through a logical derivation of these formulas, and this is presently beyond ourmeans.

Why do they not touch those who [actually] descendinto the Merkava at all?

Secondly, he must be an individualwho keeps the entire Torah, and heeds all of its prohibitions, decrees, judgments andlaws, taught to Moses on Sinai.Chapter 22If the individual has these two qualifications, then the angel Dumiel entrusts him toGabriel the scribe. He writes a note with red ink and hangs it on the chariot (karon) ofthat individual. The note describes the individual's Torah scholarship and his deeds,and states that he wishes to come before the Throne of Glory.When the guardians of the door of the Seventh Chamber see Dumiel, Gabriel andKaptziel coming before the chariot of the individual worthy of descending to theMerkava, they cover their faces, and since they were previously standing, they sitdown.

THE MANOne of the most important early figures in Kabbalah meditation is Rabbi AbrahamAbulafia. Not only was he party to many important traditions, but he also wrotevoluminously regarding them. Indeed, very little would be known about many of thesetraditions if not for his writings.Unfortunately, however, very few of his writings have ever been published. Mostexist only in manuscript form, either in major libraries or in the hands of Kabbalistswho refuse to publicize the fact. Finding and correctly identifying Abulafia'smanuscripts has been a difficult task, since many of these were catalogued incorrectlyor not catalogued at all. In a number of cases, important manuscripts were trackeddown by word of mouth and discovered in the libraries of individuals who had no ideaas to their content. Although much important work has been done by library scientists,manuscriptologists and other scholars, the study of Abulafia's writings requires muchbasic research into the largely unexplored world of ancient manuscripts.An important problem in working with manuscripts is the fact that many werewritten in ancient scripts that are almost illegible to the modern reader. Others wereprivately made, written hurriedly by individuals with poor handwriting. When added tothe fact that their basic script may now be obsolete, the reading of these manuscriptsbecomes next to impossible. Much study has to be done to decipher the alphabets ofmany manuscripts, and in some cases, relevant portions had to be transcribed letter byletter before they could be read.One reason why Abulafia's works were not published was undoubtedly related to thegeneral retincence surrounding the publication of materials dealing with meditationand the mystical arts. But another reason was the controversy that surrounded Abulafiaas a person. In many places in his writings, Abulafia indicates that he is a prophet, andin others, he hints that he has a special mission. There are also many veiled allusionsthat could be interpreted to reflect messianic delusions on his part. For the most part,however, these are ambiguous, and it is probable that when he speaks of himself as the“anointed one,” he means that he is enlightened, and not that he is the promisedmessiah. In a number of places, he speaks of the prophet experience as one resemblingbeing anointed with oil.1 In no place did Abulafia ever attempt to actually implement amessianic role for himself, so this interpretation appears highly probable."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"All of his alleged claims, however, did not escape the notice of the religious leadersof his generation. His strongest opposition came from the Rashba (Rabbi Shlomo benAdret, 1235–1310). Five years older than Abulafia, the Rashba had been appointedrabbi in Barcelona in 1280, and he enjoyed a reputation as the leading sage of his time.Even today, his Talmudic commentaries are counted among the most important, andhis responsa are considered basic to Jewish Law.It is evident that while Abulafia was in Sicily, the Rashba mounted a scathing attackagainst him. This involved his own letters as well as messages that he influenced theleaders of other congregations to send to Sicily, denouncing Abulafia. In the early1290's, the Rashba wrote a responsum to the community of Saragosta, Abulafia'sbirthplace, regarding a self-proclaimed prophet in Avila, possibly a disciple ofAbulafia. In it, he alludes to his earlier attacks on Abulafia, denouncing him in nouncertain terms.This attack by the leading figure of the generation was enough to virtually guaranteethat the religious establishment would shun and ignore Abulafia's works. In someways, however, the intensity of the attack is understandable, considering the status ofthe Kabbalah at the time. The Zohar had not yet been published, and although the Bahirhad been published in 1175, it was far from being universally accepted. A very strongschool opposed the Kabbalah, denouncing its teachings as approaching heresy. This isbest exemplified by a statement by the Rashbash (Rabbi Shlomo ben Shimon Duran,1400–1467), a century later, who wrote, “The Christians believe in the Three, while theKabbalists believe in the Ten.”2As a strong defender of the Kabbalah, the Rashba might have seen Abulafia'sstatements as being very dangerous to its healthy growth. Abulafia was very much hurtby the Rashba's attacks, and it was as a reply to them that he wrote his famous epistle,VeZof LiYehudah (And This is to Judah).The Rashba's responsum was taken up by another major Kabbalist, Rabbi JudahChayit, who lived around the time of the Spanish Inquisition. The entire attack againstAbulafia was then expanded upon by the Yashar of Candia (Rabbi Yoseph ShlomoDelmedigo, 1591–1655), one of the most important defenders of the Kabbalah.3In view of all this, one would expect that Abulafia and his writings would berelegated to the dustbin of history, and not have any influence whatsoever on theKabbalah tradition. This, however, turns out to be far from true, and his works arequoted, albeit guardedly, by many of the most important Kabbalists. Thus, the Ramak(Rabbi Moshe Cordevero, 1522–1570), dean of the Safed school, considers Abulafia tobe an authority on the pronunciation of Divine Names, and quotes a lengthy sectionfrom his Or HaSekhel (Light of the Intellect).4 In the unpublished fourth section of hisShaarey Kedushah (Gates of Holiness), Rabbi Chaim Vital cites Abulafia's methods asbeing techniques for meditation. He speaks of his Chayay Olam HaBah (Life of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Future World) as if it were a well-known book in Kabbalistic circles, and quotes atlength from his Sefer HaCheshek (Book of Passion). Another major figure, the Radbaz(Rabbi David abu Zimra, 1470–1572), mentions Abulafia's works in a positivecontext.5The final word regarding the acceptability of any Hebraic text is usually given to theChida (Rabbi Chaim Yosef David Azulai, 1724–1806). Quoting a number of attacksagainst Abulafia, the Chida then cites the fact that his works have been accepted by thegreatest Kabbalists, and have been found to be beneficial.In view of this opinion, the general trend among knowledgeable Kabbalists has beento accept the teachings of Abulafia, even though his methods are considered to be veryadvanced and dangerous. His manuscripts have been copied and circulated amongmany Kabbalists, and they form an important part of the curriculum in some secretschools. While the personality of Abulafia may be questioned, it is generallyrecognized that he was in possession of authentic traditions, and that he recorded themfaithfully and accurately.SOURCESThere are many frauds whom I have heard and seen. One is the disgusting creature,“may the name of the wicked rot,” whose name is Abraham [Abulafia]. He proclaimedhimself as a prophet and messiah in Sicily, and enticed many people with his lies.Through the mercy of God, I was able to slam the door in his face, both with my ownletters and with those of many congregations. If not for this, he would have actuallybeen able to begin.He invented many false ideas, totally foolishness which resembles high wisdom, andwith this, he could have done much damage. Making use of a certain consistence, heplaces his mind on an idea for many days, and comes up with elaborate numericalexercizes (gematriot) involving both scripture and the words of our sages.The Rashba.6I have also seen books written by a scholar by the name of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia.In his foolishness and pride . . . he calls himself a prophet. But it is taught that sincethe Temple has been destroyed, “prophecy has been given over to the insane.”7 . . . Hisbooks are filled with his own inventions, imaginations and falsehood.He may have written Or HaSekhel (Light of the Intellect) but he actually walks indarkness. He wrote the Moreh HaMoreh (Guide to the Guide) as a Kabbalisticcommentary on [Maimonides'] Guide to the Perplexed. How idiotic it is to invent aKabbalistic commentary to the Guidel Maimonides would never even dream of such aninterpretation!He also wrote a Book of the Name (this is Chayay Olam HaBah: “Life of the Future"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"World”) as a commentary on the Name of Seventy-Two. He writes the entire book as aseries of circles so as to confuse those who look at it.8 As if this would make up for itslack of true content! He filled this book with word manipulations, made up by his owndeficient mind.Rabbi Judah Chayit.9Chayah Olam HaBah (Life of the Future World) is a book written by RabbiAbraham Abulafia, in circles, concerning the Name of Seventy-Two. I have seen amanuscript of it, written on parchment.The Rashba, in Chapter 544 [of his response] and Rabbi Yashar [of Candia] in hisMetzaref LeChokhmah (Purifier of Wisdom), denounce him like one of worthless andworse.Still, I must tell the truth, I saw a great rabbi, one of the major masters of themysteries, of great reputation. According to his words, there is no question that hemade use of this book and benefited greatly from it.The Chidah.102. GROWTH OF A PROPHETAbulafia included considerable autobiographical material in his writings, and muchis therefore known about his life, even though there are some important blank spots.From all this material, we obtain a picture of a sincere, inspired individual, who alsopossessed many human failings.He was born in the year 1240. This does not appear very significant until we realizethat on the Hebrew calendar, which counts from the birth of Adam, this was the year5000, literally the beginning of a new millennium. Abulafia was very much aware ofthis distinction, and in a number of places, cites it as proof that he was destined for aspecial mission.In his autobiography, Abulafia speaks about many of his disciples. The mostimportant of these was Rabbi Joseph Gikatalia, who later was to become one of thegreatest Kabbalists of that period. Eight years younger than Abulafia, it can beascertained that he came under the influence of Abulafia in the year 1273, when he wastwenty-five years old.11 Gikatalia's Shaarey Orah (Gates of Light) became one of themost important Kabbalistic classics, and in many places, it reflects the teachings ofAbulafia.Another disciple mentioned in the autobiography is a certain Shem Tov of Burgos.We shall meet him again as one of the possible authors of Shaarey Tzedek (Gates ofRighteousness), an important exposition of Abulafia's techniques.12It has often been stated that Abulafia was opposed to the Talmud and deficient in its"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"knowledge, but this is an inaccurate conclusion. As a teenager, Abulafia learnedScripture, Mishnah and Talmud from his father, attaining what was then considered anadequate knowledge of these subjects. When the Rashba accused him of being anignoramus, he replied that he had completed the entire Talmud, and had learned how torender decisions in religious law from two prominent masters. He also states that hehad mastered Chullin, the Talmudic tract that deals with the fine points of the dietarylaws, and that which forms the core of traditional rabbinical training.13In a number of places, we clearly find that Abulafia held the masters of Talmud inhigh esteem. Once, he openly states that if not pressed by his disciples, he would ratherstudy the Talmud than write books on the mysteries.14Abulafia's earliest study consisted largely of the works of the great Jewishphilosophers, and he writes that he originally considered philosophy to be the greatestof all disciplines.14 Maimonides' famed Guide to the Perplexed remained one of hisfavorite books, and he was later to write three different commentaries on it.Abulafia mentions that he was introduced to the Guide by a certain Rabbi Hillel inCapua. This is most certainly Rabbi Hillel of Verona (1220–1295), who lived in Capuabetween 1260 and 1271. Rabbi Hillel had been a disciple of the famed Rabbi JonahGerondi (1194–1263). Rabbi Jonah had been a vehement opponent of Maimonides'Guide, but toward the end of his life, he made a public confession regretting thisopposition. Rabbi Hillel followed his master, and also became a staunch advocate ofMaimonides' teachings. When Shlomo Petit, a leading Kabbalist from Acco, attemptedto reintroduce a ban against the Guide, Rabbi Hillel became one of its most importantdefenders. Besides this, Rabbi Hillel is best known for his book Tagmuley HaNefesh(Reward of the Soul), written in 1290 in the city of Forli.15 It was from Rabbi Hillelthat Abulafia gained a strong positive impression of Maimonides' teachings, in directopposition to many important Kabbalists of that period.Besides this, Abulafia was thoroughly familiar with the mystical works from theTalmudical period, such as the Bahir, which he calls the greatest of all Kabbalahtexts.16 In at least one place, he uses a term prominent in the Zohar, indicating that hemight also have had some access to that body of literature, even though it had not yetbeen published.17It is of great significance that Abulafia also refers to the Hekhalot, which we havediscussed in the previous chapter. Although he was familiar with this text, in no placedoes he mention the actual use of its methods, but instead, advocates a different systementirely. This would appear to indicate that, like the Ari, he realized that the techniquesdescribed in the Hekhalot require a system of purification that was no longer inexistence.Another reason may be the fact that Abulafia considered himself a follower of theway of the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation), a system that he considered unique and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"different than other Kabbalistic teachings. In one place, he discussed the Kabbalisticschool utilizing the Ten Sefirot, and clearly states that the way of the Sefer Yetzirah isdifferent and higher, involving the Twenty-Two Letters of the Hebrew alphabet ratherthan the ten numbers.18There is no question that the Sefer Yetzirah played a most important role inAbulafia's career. In his autobiographical sketch, he writes that he considered hisinitiation into the mysteries of the Sefer Yetzirah as the major turning point in his life.Elsewhere, he writes that he had studied the Sefer Yetzirah with twelve of its majorcommentaries, both philosophical and Kabbalistic.19His master in the Sefer Yetzirah was Rabbi Baruch Torgami, who also apparentlyinfluenced Rabbi Isaac of Acco. Rabbi Baruch wrote a book Maftechot HaKabbalah(Keys of Kabbalah), a commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah involving numericalmanipulations (gematria) in a style very much like that of Abulafia.20 Besides this, itappears that Abulafia learned a good deal of the mystical tradition from Rabbi Baruch.The surname Torgami would indicate that Rabbi Baruch came from Turkey(Togarmah). This would imply that the mystical tradition may have been preservedthere in an unbroken tradition. This is quite likely, since at the time, Turkey had aJewish community that had flourished there since the time of Alexander the Great.There has been much confusion regarding the temptations that Abulafia mentions inhis autobiographical sketch. A key is provided by his statement that “for fifteen years,the Satan was at my right hand to mislead me.” In a number of places, Abulafiaindicates that Satan () has a numerical value of 359, the same as that of Zera Lavan(), meaning “white seed.”21 This “white seed” clearly refers to semen, asAbulafia clearly states elsewhere.22 It would therefore appear that the “Satan”indicates sexual temptation, most probably involving masturbation. This is supportedby his poem at the beginning of Chayay Olam Habah, where he speaks of his body“defiled with seed,” worthy of death, and apparently guilty of murder.23 This is anallusion to Er and Onan, who died for spilling their seed in vain, and to the Talmudicstatement that one who emits semen in vain is likened to a murderer.24This is particularly significant, since it is well established in Kabbalistic teachingsthat masturbation is one of the worst of sins, as clearly stated in the Zohar.25 The maintask of the mystic is to use the intellect and imagination to reach the highest spirituallevels, and this process is totally disrupted when one uses his imagination to conjureup sexual fantasies while masturbating. A later mystic, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov(1772–1810), considered it one of his greatest accomplishments that he was able todiscover a General Rectification (Tikun HaKehli) to undo the spiritual damage causedby masturbation.26Although Abulafia clearly recognized the primacy of the Hebrew language in his"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"mystical system, he also recognized the value of other languages and cultures. In anumber of places, he makes use of foreign terms to prove a point, and evenincorporates them into his numerical calculations.27 Once, he makes use of the Arabicor Indian number system to prove a point.28 He also had discussions with Christianmystics, and praises them for their insight. In one place he states, “There is no questionthat there are individuals among the Christians who know this mystery. They discussedthe mysteries with me and revealed that this is unquestionably their opinion,whereupon I judged them to be among the pious of the gentiles. One need not worryabout the fools of any nation, since the Torah was only given to those withintelligence.”29Abulafia's relationship with the Christians was not confined to debates, nor was heparticularly impressed with their theology. In a number of places, he speaks of suchChristian ideas as the Trinity and Incarnation as being false.30 But, in what is probablythe most dramatic episode in Abulafia's life, he went on a mission to attempt toconvert the Pope to Judaism.This Pope was Nicholas III, who, according to historical records, died in Saronno,Italy on August 22,1280 (25 Elul, 5040). This was just a few days before RoshHaShanah, the Hebrew New Year. This Pope was best known for having establishedthe Vatican as a permanent seat of the papacy, and for sending missionaries to Persiaand China. Abulafia came to see him shortly before Rosh HaShanah, and it was onlythe Pope's sudden death that saved him from being burned at the stake.Abulafia himself wrote an autobiographical account of this conversion attempt inhis Sefer HaEdot (Book of Testimonies).31 In this account, he calls himself Raziel, ananonym that he frequently used, this being the name of the angel who taught themysteries to Adam. Raziel () has a numerical value of 248, this being the same asthat of Abulafia's first name, Abraham (). As Abulafia himself indicates, thisrelationship is more than a simple gematria, but it is a mishkal (balance), since boththe numerical value and the number of letters in both names are equal.32It appears that Abulafia returned to Barcelona shortly after this, since we find himleaving there in 1281. This is particularly significant, since the Rashba, the mainopponent of Abulafia, had assumed the post of Rabbi in Barcelona in 1280. It may wellhave been the denunciation on the part of the Rashba that Abulafia refers to when hestates that he “was captured by gentiles because of denunciation on the part of theJews.”From Barcelona, Abulafia moved his base of operations to Palmyra, Sicily, and herehe wrote his Metzaref LaSekhel (Refinement of the Intellect) in 1282. It was also herethat he gained Rabbi Achitov the physician as a disciple. It was to this Rabbi Achitovthat the Rashba sent a scathing denunciation of Abulafia's methods.33A short time after this, Abulafia moved to Messina, also in Sicily. He calls this city"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Mi-Sinai, meaning “from Sinai,” possibly indicating that it was a place of revelation.His opposition, however, grew even stronger, and by 1288, he had been forced to moveto the tiny island of Cornino near Malta. After this, very little is known of his personallife, although a few of his existant works seem to have been written during this period.An excellent autobiographical account of this last period, couched in apocalypticlanguage, is found in Abulafia's Sefer HaOt (Book of the Sign). Here Abulafia usesanother anonym, Zechariyahu (), which also has the same numerical value asAbraham.SOURCESIn everything that I have written until now, my main intent was to come to what Iwill now reveal.I, [Abraham Abulafia], the individual mentioned in the introduction, was born inSaragossa, in Argon, which is in the kingdom of Spain. Before I was weaned, while Iwas still an infant suckling milk from the breasts of my mother, I moved to [Navarra],some sixteen parsangs from the city where I was born, together with my brothers andsisters. I thus grew up on the Ebro River, which passes through both of these cities.I began to read the Scriptures with their commentaries, and also learned Hebrewgrammar, completing all twenty-four books [of the Bible] under the tutelage of myfather, of blessed memory. It was from him that I also learned the Mishnah andTalmud, and most of my learning was under this instruction.I was eighteen years old when he died.I remained in the land of my birth for two years after my father passed away. At theage of twenty, God's spirit moved me, and I left, heading straight for the Land of Israelby sea and by land. My intent was the rearh the land of the Sambation,34 but I did notget further than Acco. Because of the conflict between Ishmael (the Arabs) and Esau(the Christians), I was forced to flee. I left [the Holy Land] and returned [to Europe] byway of Greece.It was while passing through [Greece] that I got married. God then aroused me, and,taking along my wife, I set out for the “waters of desire” where I could study theTorah. This I found in Capua, a journey of five days from Rome.It was here that I found a distinguished sage, philosopher, and master physician bythe name of Rabbi Hillel. We became friends, and it was from him that I learnedphilosophy, which I found very pleasant. Exploring this discipline with all my might, Ikept at it day and night. I was not satisfied until I had gone through the entire Guide tothe Perplexed many times.In Capua I also had four disciples whom I taught occasionally. They were senselessyoung men, however, and when they went out to evil ways, I abandoned them. Therewere also another ten disciples, but these too did not benefit, and they lost both ways,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"the first and the second.In Agropoli there were four disciples. But these also did not benefit from myteachings. They had very strange ideas, especially concerning the depths of wisdomand mysteries of the Torah. I did not find any who were worthy that I should even givethem the barest hints of the Truth.In Rome, there were two old men, Rabbi Tzadakia and Rabbi Yeshiah who enteredinto my covenant. With these I had some success, but they were very old and they died.In Barcelona I had two disciples. One, by the name of Rabbi Kalonymos, of blessedmemory, an older man who was quite distinguished. The other was a brilliantunmarried man, a distinguished sage, and one of the leaders of the community, by thename of Rabbi Yauda, also called Solomon.35In Burgos, I taught two men, a master and his disciple. The name of the master isRabbi Moshe Sifno.36 The disciple is Rabbi Shem Tov, a pleasant young man, but hisyouth prevented him from mastering the subject. Both he and his master only learned afew external points of the Kabbalah from me.In Medina Celi there were two disciples. One was Samuel the Prophet, to whom Itaught some Kabbalah. The other was Rabbi Joseph Gikatalia, may God continue toguide him. He had great intelligence, and will undoubtedly have great success if God iswith him.I am now in Messina, which is “from Sinai” (Mi-Sinai). Here I found six men, and Ialso brought a seventh along with me. These learned from me for a very short time,each one taking what he could, some much and some little. They all eventually left me,except for one. He was their leader, and he brought all the others to learn from me.The name of this disciple is Rabbi Saadia ben Yitzchak Sanalmapi of blessedmemory. He was followed by Rabbi Abraham ben Shalom, and then by the latter's son,Yaakov, and then by his friend Yitzchak. These were followed by other acquaintances,until I had three disciples on one level, and four on a lower level.37 The seventhdisciple was Natronai the Frenchman, of blessed memory, but for various reasons, heimmediately left us. He was the one who prevented the others from attaining what theycould. It was here that some desired things occurred, and there were some normalevents, some accidents, and some things that had to take place.When I was thirty-one years old, in Barcelona, God awakened me from my sleep,and I learned the Sefer Yetzirah with its commentaries. God's hand was upon me, and Iwrote books of wisdom and also some wondrous prophetic books. My soul awakenedwithin me, and a spirit of God touched my mouth. A spirit of holiness fluttered throughme, and I saw many fearsome sights and wonders, through signs and miracles.But at the same time, spirits of jealousy gathered around me, and I was confrontedwith fantasy and error. My mind was totally confused, since I could not find anyoneelse like me, who would teach me the correct path. I was therefore like a blind man,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"groping around at noon. For fifteen years, the Satan was at my right hand to misleadme.All this time, I was driven mad from what my eyes saw.38 But I was able to keep theTorah, and seal in the second curse for fifteen years, until God granted me wisdom andcounsel. God was thus with me from the year One (5001 = 1241) until the year 45(5045 = 1285), protecting me from all misfortune.At the beginning of the year “Elijah” (Elyah, = 46) that is, 5046, or the end of1285 c.e.) God had mercy on me and brought me to the Holy Palace. It is at this timethat I completed this book (Otzar Eden HaGanuz), which was written here in Messina.It was written for . . . the above-mentioned Saadia, the first of the seven mentionedearlier. Seeing the affection with which he attached himself to me, [I wrote this forhim] so that he should remember what he learned from me, since forgetfulness isrampant. When he has it, I know that it will also help his above-mentionedcompanions, since it is most probable that they will also learn from it.I realize that if not for various “accidents”39 and fantasies, they would have neverleft me. The fantasies that caused them to leave me and keep away from me areprecisely the ones that I myself once had. God helped me to stand my ground, andwithstanding the test enlightened my heart, since because of them I guarded my mouthand tongue. I kept my lips from speaking and my heart from thinking, and I returned tothe proper place.I continued to keep the covenant recognizing and perceiving what was hidden fromme at the time. And I praise the name of the Lord, my God and God of my fathers, whodid not withdraw His love and truth during all these times. . . .Otzar Eden HaGanuz.40Conversion of the PopeThis is the Book of Testimonies (Sefer HeEdot), the fourth commentary written byRaziel (an anonym of Abulafia), the third book of the volume. The first was the Bookof the Upright (Sefer HaYashar), written in the city of Mount Patrai in Greece in theyear 5039 (1279). The author was then 39 years old, and this was the ninth year of hisprophecy. Until that year he did not write any prophetic books, even though he wrotemany other books of wisdom, some dealing with the deepest mysteries of theKabbalah.In that ninth year, God aroused him to go to Rome, as He commanded him inBarcelona in those years.41 On the way, he passed through Tarni, where he wasimprisoned by the gentiles because he had been denounced by the Jews. A miracleoccurred and he escaped.He then settled in Capua for a short time. In the tenth year, after he had leftBarcelona, he wrote a scond book, which is called the Book of Life (Sefer HaChaim)."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"In the fifth month after Nissan, the eleventh month after Tishrei, that is, the monthof Ab (July), in the tenth year, he came to Rome. He had planned to appear before thePope on the day before the [Hebrew] New Year. The Pope was then in Saronno, a day'sjourney from Rome, and he instructed the gatekeepers that if Raziel should come tospeak to him in the name of Judaism, he should be detained, and should not be grantedan audience. They were given instructions to take him out of the city and burn him atthe stake. The wood was already prepared near the inner gate of the city.Raziel was informed of this, but he paid no heed to those who told him. Hemeditated (hitboded) and saw wonders, and at that time he wrote them down in hisBook of Testimonies. It would be a testimony between him and God that He had savedhim from his enemies.On the day that he was to see the Pope, he was given two mouths. When he enteredthe outer gate of the city, a messenger greeted him and informed him that on theprevious night, the one who had sought to kill him had suddenly died, as if from aplague. One was killed that night, and [the other] was saved.In Rome he was then imprisoned by the “Little Brothers” (Franciscans) and heremained in their academy for twenty-eight days . . . He finally went free on the first ofCheshvan (October 18, 1240).

But the poor to whom he was sent,and for whom he was revealed, did not pay attention to his coming. They began tospeak about him and his God, saying things that should not be spoken.And God commanded him to speak in His name to the gentiles, uncircumcised inheart and uncircumcised in flesh. He did this, and they believed in the announcementfrom God. But they did not return to God, for they believed in their sword and bow,and God had hardened their unclean uncircumcised hearts. God's anger was thenkindled against them, and He had mercy on His people Israel.And He then chose a time and season for the day of the proclamation. . . .And it was on that day, God went with joy and gladness, with seven lamps and fivebright lights, seeking on all the tops of the mountains.

At that time, the God of Israelwill awaken the heart of the shepherd, and he will be aroused from his sleep, and hewill awaken the hearts that sleep in the dust. The dead will then come to life, and thesheep will come home, never again to be scattered. . . .In the year 5045 (1285), in the third lunar month, that is the month of Kislev, thisbeing the ninth solar month (September), in the tenth cycle, in the fifth year of thecycle, on the first of the month, on the sixth day (Friday) . . . God awakened the spiritof Zecharyahu to review and double his prophetic books and to complete half of thisbook. On that day Zecharyahu the shepherd began to write wonders. . . .And God sent a physician to his people to heal the pain of their wound by teachingtheir sages His Name. And the sages of wisdom were sick and wounded, with “everysickness and wound that is not written in this book of the Torah”43And God said to Zecharyahu the healthy one, “Go, and I will send you to the peoplewho are stricken in heart, to heal their sickness. Take with you the remedy of ‘MyName‘ and ‘My Remembrance’.”44And God gave a gift of grace and a portion of love in the hands of Zecharyahu, andhe went about in the lands of the nations where Israel is scattered. He began to speak,and as he spoke, he ended. For he called out in the name of the Lord, the everlastingGod, from the beginning to the end, walking a straight line, not straying to the right orto the left.But only a few of the sages of Israel wished to hear the wisdom of God and theexcellence of His ways from his mouth. God appeared to the healthy among them, andasked them to heal the sick in spirit by the word of Zecharyahu.And those who would deny the highest wisdom stood up, sick and stricken withdeadly wounds. They spoke high words against God and His anointed, and against allthe healthy ones who had gone along with them, who recognized the depth of theirsickness and pursued a cure. The hearts of those who followed melted, and their spiritbecame weak, and they stopped following those who knew the Name and are countedwith it.Because of such things, God became angry at those who provoked Him and deniedHis Name. He sent one to rebuke them, and his words were a shame and an insult totheir name. So they chased him from city to city, from place to place, until he came tothe land of Mastina (Malta), to the island of Cornino. There he sat for many daysagainst his will.And it was in those days that God said to Zecharyahu, “Write for you this book,which will go against the sages of Israel in this generation, who boast about that whichI do not desire.

WRITINGSIt is not because of his personal life that Abulafia is so fascinating, but because ofthe remarkable treasure of mystical lore that he has included in his writings. While thistradition was known to other masters of that period, none wrote down more than thebarest hints regarding the explicit practices of the Kabbalah. Abulafia himself writes,“no other Kabbalist before me wrote explicit books on this subject.”46 Elsewhere hestates that the earlier authors who did write about this subject made a point ofconcealing its practices. They did not make it obvious that this was the main point oftheir books, but only mentioned it in passing. “But I have made it the main point androot of all that I have ever written.”47It apparently was not pride that led Abulafia to do this, but rather, a feeling of divinecalling. In one place he states that he was commanded by Elijah and Enoch in a visionto reveal these secrets.48 According to his calculations, prophecy was destined toreturn around the year 1285, and his books were intended to teach the methods ofattaining this level for those who were worthy of it.49 He writes that he was notmotivated by ulterior motives, because he considered himself greater than the earlierKabbalists, or because he felt that no one else would ever reveal it if not for him.Instead, he wrotes, he did so for two reasons, one theological and one human. Thetheological reason is related to the final redemption, for which these mysteries arenecessary, while the human reason is due to the lack of Kabbalah masters in hisgeneration.50Abulafia was very much aware that criticism would be directed at him because ofhis revelations. He had already been persecuted by the Rashba, and was shunned byother Kabbalists for revealing their mysteries. He writes that the mysteries involvingthe letters were revealed to the prophets, and they, in turn, revealed them to all Israel.Since it was almost forgotten, it is important to write it down. He concludes, “Eventhough I know that people will denounce both me and my books, I will not desist fromwriting.”51All this was not mere words. In a letter to Abraham Comti of Messina, Abulafiaindicates that he had already written 26 books on the mysteries, and 22 propheticbooks.52 Even these numbers are significant, since 26 is the numerical value of theTetragrammaton (YHVH, ), while 22 is the number of letters in the Hebrewalphabet.Abulafia's “prophetic” books were those written while he was in a quasi-propheticmeditative state.

Others are thought to have been written by Abulafia, butidentification is not positive.4. TEACHINGSIn the literature, there is considerable discussion regarding the term Kabbalah (), Most authorities state that it comes from the root Kabal (), meaning “to receive.”Abulafia takes this a step further, maintaining that a mystic is called a Kabbalistbecause he has received (Kibel, ) the tradition from either the prophets or those whoreceived fom them.54 Like most other Kabbalists, he saw his tradition as being that ofthe prophets, and assumed that his methods were the same as those that the prophetsused to attain their high mystical experience.The use of Divine Names plays a very important role in Abulafia's system. This isone tradition that he clearly saw as being derived from the patriarchs and prophets.Thus, when the Torah states that Abraham “called in the Name of God” (Genesis 12:8),most commentaries interpret this to mean that he prayed, or that he proclaimed God'sgreatness. Together with a number of other Kabbalists, however, Abulafia takes thisliterally, stating that Abraham actually pronounced God's Name, and through thispractice was able to attain the highest mystical levels.55T h e Sefer Yetzirah, which is attributed to Abraham, seems to support thisinterpretation. It states:56When Abraham gazed, he looked, saw, probed, and understood. He graved(chakak), hewed (chatzav) and combined (tzaraf). He was successful and theMaster of all, blessed be He, revealed himself to him.The three key words here are graved (chakak, ), hewed (chatzav, ), andcombined (tzaraf, ). According to a number of Kabbalists, these processes involvethe manipulation of letters, and it is from this that Abulafia derived his main system.Over a hundred years before Abulafia, a major commentator, Rabbi Yehudah benBarzilai of Barcelona, had explained that the word “graved” (chakak) denotes writing.He also stated that “hewed” (chatzav) denoted the formation of the letters, while“combined” (tzaraf) indicated that Abraham permuted them.57In one of his books, Abulafia virtually paraphrases this interpretation, and it wasapparently well known among the Kabbalists. Thus, the method used by Abraham, asoutlined in the Sefer Yetzirah, was primarily one of writing and permuting the lettersof the alphabet. This activity served as a meditative method, through which he reached"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"high prophetic states. This is also the core of Abulafia's system. He calls it the“Kabbalah of letters,” distinguishing it from the “Kabbalah of Sefirot.”58Another important Talmudic teaching, often quoted by Abulafia, is the statementthat “Betzalel knew how to permute (tzaraf) the letters with which the heaven andearth were created.”59 Betzalel was the one who was given the task of erecting theTabernacle in the desert after the Exodus. Through this mystical ability to manipulatethe letters of creation, he was able to build it in such a manner that it would act as achannel for the spiritual energies of creation.Very closely related to this is the fact that all of creation took place by means ofsayings. At each stage in the creation of the universe, the Bible introduces the accountby stating, “And God said.” Creation therefore took place through words. These words,however, consisted of letters, and therefore the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are themost basic building blocks of creation.60 Therefore, if an individual knows how tocorrectly manipulate the letters of the alphabet, he is able to make use of the samespiritual forces that originally brought the universe into being.Abulafia finds a hint for this in the verse, “God's way is perfect (tamim), God's wordis permuted (tzerufah)” (Psalms 18:31).61 Although the word tzerufah () in thisverse is usually interpreted to mean “refined” or “purified,” Abulafia used it in thesense of the Sefer Yetzirah, where means “blended” or “permuted.” This is alsoindicated by the word tamim (), which indicates a spiritual experience and a stateof enlightenment.62 Elsewhere, Abulafia states that the permutation of the letters itselfserves as a test and a “refining” for the initiate. Through the manner in which anindividual permutes the letters, one can know the nature of his innermost self.63Here we see an entirely new method of meditation. Instead of chanting a word overand over, as in mantra meditation, one writes a word, permuting and cycling the lettersin every possible manner. As the initiate progresses to higher and higher states, he nolonger needs to actually write the letters, but can permute them verbally or mentally.All this is an initiation to the higher levels, which actually involve the DivineNames.64 An entire handbook dealing with the various methods of manipulating lettersin this manner is attributed to Abulafia, and similar books were written by othermembers of his school.65A similar word with two meanings is rakhav (), which means “to ride,” but alsohas a connotation of “grafting” and “attaching.” This is especially significant sincerakhav is the root of the word Merkava (), which denotes the highest mysticalexperiences. As Abulafia points out, this also has the connotation of grafting andcombining, and therefore, the “Mystery of the Merkava” involved the combination ofletters, words and Divine Names.Abulafia thus discusses the phrase, “One who looks at the gazing (tzefiyat) of theMerkava.”66 He states that the meaning of this was known to the sages by a tradition"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"from the prophets, and consisted of “grafting (harkava, ) of one letter to another,one word to another, one Divine Name to another.”Each such Merkava-combination combines the power of the Divine Names, theSefirot, and the letters. When these influence an individual, they direct him in formingevery possible permutation. Because their essence is sealed in these permutations,every key of wisdom is given over to the individual who “gazes, sees, andunderstands.”When an individual looks into these permutations in a proper manner, he can see allof creation. He is like a person looking into a glass mirror, who sees both his own face,and the faces of all who pass by.67 Abulafia writes that, “when the power of the influxbegins to manifest and reveal itself to the one gazing into the ‘mirror,’ the letters andSefirot begin to appear before him, like lightning flashes. This is like the vision of theChayot, regarding which it is written, ‘The Chayot ran and returned, like a vision oflightning’ (Ezekiel 1:14).”68This is also the meaning of what the Sefer Yetzirah says, “Ten Sefirot ofNothingness, their vision (tzafiyah, ) is like a flash of lightning.”69 The word“vision” (tzafiyah) here, is a term that has a special connotation of prophecy and themystical vision.Although Abulafia considered the “Method of Sefirot” to be different than the“Method of Letters” that he taught, he does occasionally speak in guarded tones aboutascending through the “ladder of the Sefirot.”70 Still, he was very careful not to stressthis method. He realized that if one meditated on the Sefirot, it would be very easy tosee them as independent entities, thus introducing an element of plurality into theabsolute unity of the Godly realm.71 This, in turn, can lead to the actual worship of theSefirot, and according to at least one Kabbalistic source, this was the first step thateventually led to pagan polytheism.72Another type of meditation that Abulafia hints at is contemplation. He particularlyspeaks about this with respect to the blue thread in the Tzitzit, the ritual tassel worn onthe Prayer Shawl (Tallit). Speaking of the Tzitzit, the Torah says, “You shall gaze at it,and remember all of God's commandments” (Numbers 15:39). The Talmud expoundson this, saying, “the blue thread resembles the sea, the sea resembles the firmament,and the firmament resembles the Throne of Glory.”73 What the Talmud is actuallydoing is alluding to the fact that this thread is to be used as an object of meditativecontemplation, outlining the steps of spiritual ascent.This thread was colored with a blue dye taken from the chilazon, a mollusc relatedto the murex. Abulafia notes that the word chilazon () has the same letters as la-chazon (), meaning, “for a vision.”74 Through this dye, one could attain a visionapproaching that of prophecy."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Still, Abulafia's main method involved the permutation of letters, and, on a higherlevel, pronouncing the letters of the Divine Names. Such pronunciation was to beaccompanied by specific head motions, as well as particular breathing exercises.The true mystical experience is beyond description, and cannot be explained to onewho has not experienced it himself. Just as a person who has been blind from birthcannot comprehend the concept of color, so one who has been spiritually blind cannotgrasp the brilliant spectrum of the spiritual world. Abulafia thus writes, “One whoreaches the highest level cannot reveal it to anyone. All he can do is give over the keys,so that the enlightened individual can open the gates which are sealed to exclude theunworthy.”75Both the opportunities and dangers facing one who enters the mysteries aregraphically described by Abulafia. He writes that divine wisdom has both a right sideand a left side. This mystery is the highest level, since it teaches the individual how toattain true enlightenment. But still, even if one makes use of all the necessarytechniques, he cannot attain the higher levels unless he is properly prepared for this.Abulafia writes that, “many great men and sages have stumbled and fell, were trappedand snared, because they exceeded the bounds of their knowledge.”76Abulafia then continues, speaking of the highest level, which is the Crown. Theword for Crown is Keter (), and Abulafia notes that when these letters reversed,they spell karet (), which means “cut off.”77 Thus, when an individual attempts toreach the highest level of the Crown, if he is not worthy, he can end up being “cut off”spiritually. Abulafia therefore warns in the strongest terms that one who attempts toenter these mysteries must be adequately prepared, and that one not enter unless he isthoroughly familiar with all the necessary introductions.An especially strong warning is given against spiritual dilettantism. If a personenters the mysteries as a whim, without preparation, he can be destroyed, bothspiritually and psychologically. In pronouncing this warning, Abulafia writes to theuninitiated, “You mind will be confused, your thoughts confounded, and you will notfind any way to escape the reveries of your mind. The power of your imagination willoverwhelm you, making you imagine many utterly useless fantiasies. Your imaginativefaculty will grow stronger, weakening your intellect, until your reveries cast you into agreat sea. You will not have the wisdom ever to escape from it, and will thereforedrown.”78 He warns that before one attempts to attain the “small still voice,” he mustfirst grasp the mysteries of the Kabbalah with his intellect.The ultimate mysteries are alluded to by the Garden of Eden.79 The Torah relatesthat after Adam sinned and was expelled, this garden was protected by “the flame of arotating sword” (Genesis 3:24). Abulafia explains that the manner in which this swordrotates depends on the readiness of the individual attempting to enter. If he is worthy,it becomes the mirror through which he perceives, while if he is not worthy, he is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"burned out and “cut off” by the fire of this sword. The one who oversees the sword,preventing the unworthy from entering is the angel Metatron. The turning sword itselfis the cycle of the intellect.80Abulafia writes that the letters, used by the initiate, are engraved on the cycle of theintellect, and it is through this cycle that one perceives the transcendental. The sourceof his vision is the Holy Palace, which is the precise center of that cycle.81The sphere of the intellect has the power to travel through the spiritual realm, whichis the realm of Pure Intellect. As one begins to enter this realm, he can climb therevolving sphere of the intellect as if it were a ladder. When he actually ascends, histhought processes are turned over and his entire perception is altered, so that he retainsnothing of his normal mental state.Entering such a state of consciousness can be extremely dangerous. Abulafia writesthat, “one must completely alter his nature and personality, transporting himself froma state of feeling to one of intellect, from the path of the imagination to one of burningfire. Otherwise, he will ultimately find his visions altered, his thought processesdemolished, and his reveries confounded. The sphere is what refines and tests, andregarding it the Scripture states, A refinery (metzaref, ) is for silver, a furnace isfor gold, but God tries the heart' (Proverbs 17:3).”82Abulafia goes on to state that “God gave us the Torah, teaching us the way ofpermutations, and the steps of the ladder involving the mystery of letters. Without suchinformation, it is impossible to reach the level of knowing God.” He explains that thehigher one ascends, the more barriers must be sundered.83 Speaking at length of thesebarriers, he discusses the Biblical passages which appear to indicate that God is hiddenby gloom and cloud. Since God is infinite, it is impossible for anything to encompassHim, but this “gloom and cloud” is actually in the human intellect, which cannotactually perceive God.84While one must break through the barriers, one must also be careful not to enter tooclose. One who goes beyond the proper boundary can be swallowed up by the light anddie of rapture, very much like Ben Azzai. According to Abulafia and other Kabbalists,this was the death known as the “kiss of God,” which, according to the Talmud wasreserved for the greatest saints.85 One method of avoiding this is to bind one's ownsoul with an oath that it not leave the body.86But even more important, one mustconstantly avert his gaze, going “back and forth.” This is the meaning of what the SeferYetzirah teaches:87Ten Sefirot of Nothingness: Close your mouth that it not speak of them, andyour heart that it not think. And if your heart runs, return to its place, It is thuswritten, “The Chayot ran and returned” (Ezekiel 1:14). Regarding this, acovenant has been made."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Abulafia maintained that when an individual is on the highest meditative levels, hecan actually alter the laws of nature through sheer spiritual force.88 Still, he wasgenerally very much opposed to using these powers for such a purpose, seeing theirmain goal as being spiritual enlightenment, and not mere magic tricks. In a number ofplaces he graphically describes the magical techniques of the practical Kabbalah,denouncing them in no uncertain terms.89The best time for the deepest levels of meditation is in old age, when the intellect iswell developed and the pull of the body is weak. Although young people may try toenter the mysteries, Abulafia taught that they will not reach the higher levels until theyare advanced in age.90 This reflects the Talmudic teaching that such mysteries shouldnot be taught to an individual unless he is “halfway through his years.”91Highly controversial was Abulafia's claim to have attained true prophecy, eventhough he did not live in the Holy Land. According to the Midrash, prophecy can onlybe attained in the Holy Land, and not anyplace else, except under sharply restrictedconditions.92 Abulafia refused to accept this literally, and said that the Holy Landdiscussed in this teaching referred to a specific spiritual level. If an individual reachedthis level, he could attain prophecy, no matter what his geographical location.935. THE HIDDEN EDENMany types of meditation involve the repetition or chanting of certain words andphrases. In Abulafia's system, however, writing also plays a very important role.Rather than recite various letter combinations, the initiate was to write them down. Anespecially effective technique was to take a word and permute its letters in everypossible way. From this, the initiate would procede to manipulate the word in otherways, making use of various ciphers and numerical values of the letters.This is alluded to in the Sefer Yetzirah, which speaks of the number of ways inwhich various words can be permuted. Thus, a word containing three letters has sixpermutations, one containing four has 24, one containing five has 120, and a word withsix letters has 720 permutations.94 There is a special technique, known as cycling(galgal, ) through which one permutes the letters of a word in a prescribedmanner.95 Writing in this manner is a type of meditation, where one makes use of boththe path of the body and that of the intellect.Another important reason for the effectiveness of this method is the fact that theletters are the very essence of creation, and therefore, when one writes and permutesthem, he can channel these forces into his spiritual being. Abulafia notes that d'yo (),the Hebrew word for ink, has the same letters as Yod (), the initial letter () of theTetragrammaton (YHVH, ), and the substance of the spiritual realm.96 The ink withwhich one writes is therefore the substance of his spiritual experience, from which all"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"else follows.Abulafia wrote much about the permutation and combination of letters, devoting hisentire Sefer HaTzeruf (Book of Blendings) to the subject. There, however, he writesvery little regarding the actual method in which one makes use of such permutations.There is, however, one place where Abulafia goes into this at length, and this is in hisOtzar Eden HaCanuz (Treasury of the Hidden Eden).97An Excerpt FromOtzar Eden HaGanuzI have explained what you need to do this, and you lack nothing. Take the pen,parchment and ink, and write the letters, permuting them in such a manner as to denotegood. “Depart from evil, do good, seek peace and pursue it.” (Psalms 34.15)98These things cannot be know unless one knows the Name . . . It is written, “Everyword of God is permuted (tzeruf), He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him”(Proverbs 30:5) . . . This teaches that true knowledge depends on God's sayings, whichmust be permuted, and tested through such permutation. It is the permutation of lettersthat tests these things, as it is written, “A permuter (metzaref) for silver, a furnace forgold, but God tests the heart” (Proverbs 17:3).99The way of Permutations (Tzeruf, ) is the closest way to truly know God, moreso than any other way. The individual who wishes to enter the Way of permutationsshould immediately test and permute (purify) his heart with the great fire, which is thefire of darkness.100If one has the power to endure the way of rebuke with great passion, and if his mindcan control its fantasies, then he can ride [his mind] like a horse. He can control it ashe desires, spurring it on to go forward, or reigning it to stop where he pleases. At alltimes, his imagination remains subject to his will, not straying from its authority, evenby a hairbreadth.A person with this power is truly a mighty warrior . . . He is like Uriel, whoconstantly gazes at the Light of God, delighting in God's mysteries. . . .Now I will tell you the mystery of the true discipline, through which you can alterthe laws of nature. . . . This is the path along which you must travel to attain themystery of true discipline:Take in your hand a scribe's pen. Write speedily, letting your tongue utter the wordswith a pleasant melody, very slowly. Understand the words that leave your lips. Thewords can consist of anything that you desire, in any language that you desire, for youmust return all languages to their original substance. I have alluded to this elsewhere, .. . but this is its correct place. . . .You already know that Isaiah said, “Declare the letters backward, and then we willknow that you are gods, that you can do good and evil, and we will meditate (,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"from sha'ah, ) and see together” (Isaiah 41:23). He also said [in God's name], “AskMe of letters, and command Me over My sons and the work of My hands” (Isaiah45:11). Again, he said [in God's name], “Tell them of the letters that will come”(Isaiah 44:7).101 These three verses are trusted witnesses to the power of the letters.Take the pen in your hand, like a spear in the hand of a warrior. When you think ofsomething, uttering it in your heart with specific letters, also express it with yourmouth. Listen carefully, and “watch what emanates from your lips” (Deuteronomy23:24). Let your ears hear what your lips speak, and with your heart, understand themeaning of all these expressions.Write each expression down immediately. Manipulate the letters, and seek out otherwords having the same numerical value, even if they do not follow my path. And knowthat this will be your key to open the fifty gates of wisdom. . . .You must be alone when you do this. Meditate (hitboded ) in a state of rapture so asto receive the divine influx, which will bring your mind from potential to action.Permute the letters, back and forth, and in this manner, you will reach the first level.As a result of the activity and your concentration on the letters, your mind will becomebound to them. The hairs on your head will stand on end and tremble.Your life blood is in your heart, and regarding this it is written, “the blood is thesoul” (Deuteronomy 12:23). It is likewise written, “the blood in the soul will atone”(Leviticus 17:11). This blood within you will begin to vibrate because of the livingpermutations that loosen it. Your entire body will then begin to tremble, and all yourlimbs will be seized with shuddering. You will experience the terror of God, and willbe enveloped with fear of Him.You will then feel as if an additional spirit is within you, arousing you andstrengthening you, passing through your entire body and giving you pleasure. It willseem as you have been annointed with perfumed oil, from head to foot.102You will rejoice and have great pleasure. You will experience ecstasy and trembling— ecstasy for the soul, and trembling for the body. This is like a rider who races ahorse, the rider rejoices and is ecstatic, while the horse trembles under him.There will be no question that, through this wondrous method, you will have reachedone of the Fifty Gates of Understanding.103 This is the lowest gate. But once you haveentered this gate, you are protected from the gatekeeper whose name is AZ ().Regarding this gatekeeper it is written, “[God acquired me (Wisdom) at the beginningof His way,] the first of His works from AZ” (Proverbs 8:22).104 This is the mystery of“the beginning of His way.”The Divine Presence will then rest on you, and the Fifty Gates of Understanding willbe opened in your heart. From then on, you will realize Who is with you, Who is overyour head, and Who is in your heart. You will then recognize the true way.Treasury of the Hidden Eden."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"6. LIGHT OF THE INTELLECTOnce one has mastered the technique of letter permutation, the next step inAbulafia's system involves the pronunciation of the various names of God. Thesimplest of these involves the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, YHVH (). Theseletters are combined with the letter Alef (), together with the five primary vowels.This method is presented in detail in Abulafia's Or HaShekhal (Light of theIntellect), and it is one of the very few cases where his meditative techniques havefound their way into a standard published Kabbalah classic. This entire selection ispresented by the Ramak (Rabbi Moshe Cordevero, 1522–1570), in his Pardes Rimonim(Orchard of Pomegranates), one of the most important of all Kabbalah classics.105In this selection, however, the Ramak does not attribute this method to Abulafia, butrather to an obscure Sefer HaNikud (Book of Dots). While there are a number of bookswith this name, none of them are known to speak of this method. Several of thesebooks have been lost and are only known because they are mentioned in other texts, themost important being attributed to Rabbi Aaron of Baghdad, a Kabbalist of the NinthCentury.106 It is entirely possible that both Abulafia and the Ramak are actuallyquoting from a much older text known as Sefer HaNikud, and this is supported by themanner in which it appears in Abulafia's manuscripts. It is equally possible, however,that only this small portion was copied, and that it was generally called Sefer HaNikud.In any case, it is well established that the Ramak was familiar with Abulafia'system.107Techniques very similar to those presented here are also discussed by otherKabbalists, even by opponents of Abulafia, such as Rabbi Judah Chayit.108 It is alsomost interesting to note that a very similar method is prescribed for the creation of aGolem.109Briefly, the system of Or HaSekhel involves the combination of the four letters ofGod's name, Yod () Heh () Vav () Heh (), with the letter Alef (), and then cyclingit through the five basic vowels. These vowels are:Cholam (), having the sound of o.Kametz (), having the sound of a.Tzer'é (), having the sound of e.Chirek (), having the sound of i.Shurek (), having the sound of u.Together with each pronunciation, one must move his head in a motion resemblingthe actual form of each vowel. At the same time, one must breath in a specific manner,with a certain number of breaths permitted between letters, and more between lines."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"An Excerpt FromThe Light of the IntellectIt is known that the [consonant] letters do not have any sound by themselves. Godtherefore gave the mouth the power to express the letters, pronouncing them as theyare found in a book. For this purpose, he provided vowel points for the letters,indicating the sound with which they must be expressed when they are translated froma book to the mouth. These vowels are what allow the letters to be sounded, and theycan also be written as letters in a book.The vibrations of these sounds must also be associated with space. No vibration canoccur except in a definite time and place.The elements of space are the dimensions and distances. The elements of time arethe cycles, through which it is measured. This includes such divisions as years, monthsand days.One must therefore know how to draw out the sound of each letter as it is related tothese dimensions.This is the mystery of how to pronounce the Glorious Name:Make yourself right. Meditate (hitboded ) in a special place, where your voicecannot be heard by others. Cleanse your heart and soul of all other thoughts in theworld. Imagine that at this time, you soul is separating itself from your body, and thatyou are leaving the physical world behind, so that you enter the Future World, which isthe source of all life distributed to the living.[The Future World] is the intellect, which is the source of all Wisdom,Understanding and Knowledge, emanating from the King of Kings, the Blessed HolyOne. All creatures fear Him with a great awe. This is the fear of one who actuallyperceives, and it is double the fear of one who merely has experienced love or awe.Your mind must then come to join His Mind, which gives you the power to think.Your mind must divest itself of all other thoughts other than His Thought. Thisbecomes like a partner, joining you to Him through His glorious, awesome Name.You must therefore know precisely how to pronounce the Name. Its form [is givenin the tables].This is the technique. When you begin to pronounce the Alef (k) with any vowel, itis expressing the mystery of Unity (Yichud). You must therefore draw it out in onebreath and no more. Do not interrupt this breath in any manner whatsoever until youhave completed the pronunciation of the Alef.Draw out this breath as long as you extend a single breath. At the same time, chantthe Alef, or whatever other letter you are pronouncing, while depicting the form of thevowel point.The first vowel is the Cholem (o, ·), above the letter."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"When you begin to pronounce it, direct your face toward the east, not looking up ordown.

Purify yourthoughts, and as you exhale, raise your head, little by little, until when you finish, yourhead is facing upward. After you finish, prostrate yourself on the ground.Do not interrupt between the breath associated with the Alef and the breathassociated with the other letter in the pair. You may, however, take a single breath, andit may be long or short.Between each pair of letters, you may take two breaths without making a sound, butnot more than two.

Do not speak at all, but incline your ear to hear what is being said to you.If you feel great terror and cannot bear it, prostrate yourself immediately, even inthe middle of pronouncing a letter.If you do not see or hear anything, do not use this technique again all that week.It is good to pronounce this once each week, in a form that “runs and returns.” Forregarding this, a covenant has been made.111What can I add? What I have written is clear, and if you are wise, you willunderstand the entire technique.If you feel that your mind is unstable, that your knowledge of Kabbalah isinsufficient, or that your thoughts are bound to the vanities of the time, do not dare topronounce the Name, lest you sin all the more.Between the tablet of the Yod and that of the Heh, you can take twenty-five breaths,but not more. But you must not make any interruption at this time, not with speech andnot with thought.The same is true between the Heh and the Vav, and between the Vav and the finalHeh. But if you wish to take less than twenty-five breaths, you may do so.Light of the Intellect.1127. LIFE OF THE FUTURE WORLDOf all Abulafia's books, the one that explains his methods most completely is hisChayay Olam HaBah (Life of the Future World). This was well known to theKabbalists, and in the unpublished fourth section of his Shaarey Kedushah (Gates ofHoliness), Rabbi Chaim Vital speaks of it as being the most important guide for"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"attaining meditative enlightenment. To this day, Chayay Olam HaBah is known toKabbalists, and it exists in many manuscripts, both in libraries and in privatecollections. While its methods are considered to be very highly advanced, there arestill some closed Kabbalistic circles that actually make use of them.The main method discussed in Chayay Olam HaBah is very similar to that found inOr HaSekhel, also involving the same head motions as well as controlled breathing.Instead of making use of the Tetragrammaton, however, this book utilizes the Name ofSeventy-Two Combinations.This Name was known from most ancient times, and is discussed in both the Bahirand the Zohar, but significantly, not in the Hekhalot.113 By the Eleventh Century, ithad been popularized in Rashi's commentaries, and is also mentioned in a lateMidrash.114 But while the Name itself was known earlier, the actual methods of its usehad never been written down until Abulafia did so.The Name of Seventy-Two is derived from three very interesting verses (Exodus14:19–21), reproduced on the following page. Counting the letters of these threeverses, one immediately discovers that each one contains exactly seventy-two letters.These verses then form the basis for the seventy-two triplets in the Name.The process of constructing the Name is outlined in the Bahir, and is verystraightforward. One takes the letters of the first verse in direct order, those of thesecond in reverse order, and those of the third verse in direct order.Thus, one begins with the first letter of the first verse, which is a Vav (). Then onetakes the last letter of the middle verse, which is a Heh (), and finally, the first letterof the third verse, which is a Vav (). Combining these, one obtains the first triplet,VHV ().In order to construct the second triplet, one procedes in a similar manner. One takesthe second letter, Yod (), of the first verse, the second letter from the end of themiddle verse, Lamed (), and the second letter of the last verse, Yod (). This results inthe second triplet, YLY (). One then continues in this manner until all seventy-twotriples are completed.Derivation of the Name of Seventy-TwoThe Three Verses: Exodus 14:19–21And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved, and wentbehind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and went behind them."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel, and cloud anddarkness were there, yet it gave light in the night, and one did not come near theother all that night.And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and God caused the sea to go backwith a strong east windall the night, and it made the sea into dry land, and the waterswere parted.THE NAME OF SEVENTY-TWOThis, however, only provides the consonants of the Name. The vowels used whenpronouncing the Name are the “natural vowels” associated with each consonant.115Abulafia explains that the “natural vowel” is the first vowel found in the letter's ownname. Thus, for example, the first vowel in the name of the letter Bet (, written out as ) is “e,” and therefore, ”é or the Tzeré () is the natural vowels of the Bet. Similarly,the first vowel in Gimel ( written out as ) is “i,” and hence “i,” or Chirek (.), is thenatural vowel for Gimel. The same is true of all the other letters."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"In general, Chayay Olam HaBah is a book that speaks most elequently for itself.

Sit in one"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"place in a room or attic. Do not reveal your secret to anyone.If you engaged in this by day, do so in a darkened room. It is best, however, that youdo it at night.At this time, when you prepare yourself to speak to your Creator and you desire towitness His might, be careful to cleanse your thoughts of all worldly folly.Wrap yourself in your Tallit. If the time is proper, also place your Tefillin on yourhead and arm. This will increase your awe and trembling before the Divine Presencewhich will visit you at this time.Wear clean clothing. If possible, all your clothing should be white. This is of greathelp for one's concentration on fear and love [of God].If it is at night, light many candles, so that your eyes are well illuminated.Then take in your hand a tablet and some ink. These will serve as your witnessesthat you are coming to serve God with joy and good heart.Then begin to permute a number of letters. You may use only a few, or you mayused many. Transpose and permute them quickly, until your heart is warmed as a resultof these permutations, their motions, and what is derived from these permutations.As a result of these permutations, your heart will become extremely warm. From thepermutations, you will gain new knowledge that you never learned from humantraditions nor derived from intellectual analysis. When you experience this, you areprepared to receive the influx (shefa, )The influx will then come, bestowed to you. It will arouse in you many words, oneafter the other.Then prepare your inner thoughts to depict God and His highest angels. Depict themin your heart as if they were human beings, sitting or Standing around you. You are intheir midst, like a messenger whom the King and His servants wish to send on amission. You are ready to hear the words of the message, whether it is from the Kingor from one of His servants, from His mouth, or from the mouth of any one of them.After you have depicted all this, prepare your mind and heart so that your thoughtsshould understand the many things that come to you through the letters that your heartimagines. Understand each concept and its reasons, both as a whole and in its parts.Ponder them, like a person who has a parable or example revealed in a dream, or likeone who delves into a very deep concept in a book of wisdom.Take each concept that you hear, and interpret it with the best and closestinterpretation that you can. Judge yourself according to what you understand from it.And what you are told can also relate to others.All this will take place after you have cast the tablet from your hand and the penfrom between your fingers, or after they have fallen of their own accord because ofyour many thoughts.The divine influx will begin to prevail in you, and will weaken your external and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"internal organs. Your entire body will begin to tremble, until you think that you areabout to die. This is because your soul is separating itself from your body as a result ofthe great joy that you experience when you perceive and recognize these things.In your mind, you will then choose death rather than life. For death only involvesthe body, and as a result, the soul lives forever when it is resurrected.You then know that you have reached a level where you are receiving the divineinflux.At that time, you may wish to honor the glorious Name and serve Him with the lifeof your body and soul. Conceal your face, and be afraid to gaze upon God. “Do notcome closer. Remove your shoes from your feet, for the place upon which you stand isholy ground” (Exodus 3:5).Instead, involve yourself with your body once again. Stand up, eat something, drinksomething, smell a pleasant fragrance, and let your spirit once again return to itssheath. Let your heart rejoice with its portion, and know that God loves you. Heteaches you for your benefit, He teaches man knowledge.117After you have done this successfully many times, you will become an expert in“choosing life.” When you are strong and stable, you can make use of another, highermethod.When attempting this method, prepare yourself in the manner discussed earlier.Clear your mind completely.Then, with complete concentration and with a proper, pleasant, sweet melody,pronounce the Name [of Seventy-Two].Using the natural vowels of each letter, [begin by pronouncing these six triplets]:These six triplets of the Holy Name pronounce with eighteen breaths.If the divine influx does not force you to stop, continue pronouncing the Name inthis manner until you reach the triplet MVM (), [the last of the seventy-two].We have a tradition that the divine influx will come to a perfected individual afterhe completes [the number of letters in] the first verse, that is, after he pronouncestwenty-four triplets.This is alluded to in the word “my Beloved” — Dodi ( = 24). It is thus written,“The sound of my Beloved (Dodi) knocking” (Song of Songs 5:2).You may then see the image of a child (Naar, = 320) or that of a Sheik ( = 320).In Arabic, the word “Sheik” means an “elder.” You see the image of an old man(Zaken, ), since the numerical value of Naar is the same as “Elder and Elder” (ZakenVeZaken, ( = 320).The mystical name of the one who appears to you is Metatron, whose name is also"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Naar.118His name is also Enoch (Chanokh, ). This is alluded to in the verse, “Train(Chanokh) a child (Naar) in his way, and when he is old (Zaken), he will not departfrom it” (Proverbs 22:6).Combine “raise” (Chanokh, = 84) and “his way” (Darko, = 230), and youwill discovery his mystery.119Thus, “our way is his strength” (Dark-enu Koch-o, = 314). Likewise, “ourstrength is his way” (Koch-enu Dark-o, = 314). [The numerical value ofMetatron () is 315.]When you see him, strengthen your heart and understand his ways. “Take heed ofhim and hearken to his voice — do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive yoursin — for My Name is in him” (Exodus 23:21).120Behold God's Name, Shaddai ( = 314). This is Metatron.121 He is the “Prince ofNames” (Sar HaShemot, ), who speaks with the “authority of the Name”(Reshut HaShem, ). [Both expressions contain the same letters.]These twenty-four triplets contain seventy-two letters.Therefore, when he speaks, respond and say, “Speak my Lord, for Your servant(Avdekha) is listening” (1 Samuel 3:9).122 [Both of these numbers are alluded to in theword Avdekha (), which can be broken into] Av ( = 72) and dekha ( = 24).The angel who teaches you the mystery of God (YHVH, ) and His Name isGabriel. He speaks out of the first verse (pasuk) of the Holy Name that is pronouncedby your mouth, and he provides you with a vision (mareh) of prophecy. This is themystery of the verse, “I make Myself known to him in a vision (mareh), I speak to himin a dream (chalom)” (Numbers 12:6).A vision (Mareh, = 246) is the mystery of the verse (Pasuk, = 246). This isGabriel ( = 246).A dream (Chalom, = 84) is the mystery of “my Witness” (Ed-iy, = 84). Thisis Enoch (Chanoch, = 84).“And now, also, my Witness (Ed-iy) is in heaven, and He who testifies for me is onhigh” (Job 16:19), that this Kabbalah tradition is true.If, heaven forbid, you do not receive anything when you pronounce the first verse,start again and begin the second verse.Pronounce [the second set of triplets]:Concentrate as much as you can. As you pronounce each letter, exhale while you"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"sound out the accompanying vowel together with its proper motion.There are only five vowels, and their order is o a e i u (). The exhalation forall of them is the same. . . .The Name contains 21 different letters.

They are tenin all.The letters containing the third vowel [Tzeré (e)] are Bet (), Heh (), Chet (), Tet (), Mem (), Peh (), and Resh (). There are seven in all.The letter containing the fourth, special vowel [Chirek (i)] is Shin (). This is theonly such letter [in the Name].There is one other letter that has the vowel [Shurek (u)] to itself, and this is the Nun().There is also another letter, Gimel (), that shares the vowel [Chirek (i)] with theShin. But although it is found in the alphabet and in books, it does not exist in theName, because of a reason already discussed elsewhere.123As you begin to pronounce each letter, begin to move your heart and your head.Since your heart is internal, move it mentally. But your head is external, and therefore,you must move it physically.Move your head following the actual form of the vowel point associated with theletter that you are pronouncing.This is the form of the head motions:The vowel point written above the letter is called Cholem (o, ). This is the onlyvowel point above the letter, since all the others are written beneath the letter.When you pronounce [the Cholem] together with the letters Yod () or Kof (), beginfacing directly straight ahead. Do not incline your head to the right or left, upward ordownward. Keep your head straight and even, like the balance of a scale, just as itwould be if you were speaking face to face to a person of the same height as yourself.Then, as you draw out the sound of the letter while you pronounce it, begin to moveyour head so as to face upward, toward the sky. Close your eyes, open your mouth, andlet the words shine. Clear your throat of all phlegm, so that it should not disturb yourpronunciation. As you exhale, continue to raise your head at the same rate, so that youcomplete the exhalation and head motion simultaneously. If you complete the headmotion before the exhalation, do not lower your head until you have exhaledcompletely.Between each letter, you may rest and prepare yourself. At this time, you can take asmany as three breaths, like those associated with the pronunciation.

[The reasonfor this is that the word for “month,” Chodesh ( = 312), is equal to twelve DivineNames ( = 26); 12 × 26 = 312.] This is for the sinners in Israel, whose bodies arejudged in Gehinom for twelve months.124"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"These breaths give rise to a third triplet, and this gives a total of eighteen [meaning“life” (Chai, = 18).]The Divine Presence then dwells on earth, speaking to man, “from above the arkcover, from between the two Cherubs” (Exodus 25:22).The two Cherubs allude to the Divine Presence (HaShekihnah, = 390).

Then bring your head back so that you are facing directly forward, toward theeast, since you are facing this direction when you pronounce the Name. This practicemust be done while one faces the east, just as in the case of formal worship.Conclude by bowing down slightly [so as to parallel the dot beneath the line of theKametz].

GATES OF RIGHTEOUSNESSAlthough Abulafia presents an excellent overview of his methods, he does not fitthem together into a single system, nor does he discuss the form of his experiences inany detail. This is left to an anonymous disciple, author of Shaarey Tzion (Gates ofRighteousness), a book that was most probably written in the year 1295 in Hebron.129A clue to the identity of the author is provided in another manuscript, which indicatesthat the author's name was Shem Tov. As mentioned earlier, Abulafia had a disciple bythe name of Shem Tov of Borgus, and it is highly probable that he is the author of thisbook.There is very little question that the master mentioned in this book is none otherthan Abulafia himself. And for the most part, the material here appears to parallel that"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"in other works by Abulafia.130 Most important, however, is an autobiographical sketch,where the author speaks of his experience with Abulafia, describing his initialskepticism and ultimate enlightenment. We will not include this here, however, since ithas already been published elsewhere in English.131Numerous copies of this book were made, and it exerted an important influence onthe later Kabbalists of the Holy Land. Almost an entire chapter was copied twohundred years later in the main work of Rabbi Judah Albotini, whom we shall discussin the next section. Another important Kabbalah text, Shoshan Sodot (Rose ofMysteries), actually quotes it by name.The author speaks of three ways through which one can divest himself of thephysical: the common way, the philosophical way, and the Kabbalistic way. Thecommon way involves a method called “erasure” (mechikah), where one attempts toerase all images from the mind.132 The author notes that he was aware that the MoslemSufis also made use of this technique, and that one method involved the repeatedchanting of the name “Allah.”133 Although the Sufis are able to attain a degree ofecstasy in this manner, the author writes that they cannot know its significance, sincethey are not party to the Kabbalah tradition.Discussing the philosophical way, the author speaks of a certain philosopher by thename of Ben Sina, who wrote many volumes while in a state of meditation(hitbodedut). When an idea was particularly difficult, he would concentrate on it andponder it, often drinking a cup of strong wine, enabling him to sleep on it.134 This is ofparticular interest, since a very similar procedure is also discussed by Rabbi Isaac ofAcco, and this is one indication that the two shared a common tradition.135It is in discussing the way of Kabbalah that the author mentions his master, who isidentified as Abulafia. The master spent four months teaching him the methods ofletter permutations, telling him to erase everything from his mind. Finally he told him,“The goal is not to stop at any finite form, even though it is of the highest order.Through the way of Divine Names, one can reach a level where the power is not underhis control. The more incomprehensible the Names, the greater is their advantage.”136The master then showed him books composed of utterly incomprehensible Namesand number combinations, saying, “This is the Path of Names.” The author spent twomonths deeply meditating on these, and finally, one night, he awoke to see a lightshining from his face. At first he did not believe what he was seeing, but no matterwhere he walked in the dark, this light followed him, even when he hid under a blanket.He was aware that this was something that could not be explained in any naturalmanner.Upon informing the master of this experience, the author was told to spend half histime permuting letters, and half making use of the Divine Names. One night whilepermuting the letters of the Name of Seventy-Two, he began to see the letters"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"expanding before his eyes, growing until they looked like great mountains.137 His hairstood on end, and he began to speak automatically, saying words of wisdom.On a later occasion, the author made use of a technique involving theTetragrammaton. At first, he felt as if he would die, but after saying a sincere prayer,he suddenly felt as if he were being anointed with oil from head to toe.138 He then felta tremendous spiritual experience, which he speaks of as indescribable sweetness ofrapture and ecstasy.An excerpt fromThe Rose of Mysteries139“The power of the prophets to liken a form to its Creator” is a very great mystery. ...I found an ancient teaching that explains this, and I will write it down here. . . . Theseare the author's words:The following was told to me by the enlightened sage, Rabbi Nathan, of blessedmemory:140When an individual completely enters the mystery of prophecy, he suddenly sees hisown image standing before him. He becomes totally unaware of his own essence, as ifit were concealed from him. Then he sees his own image standing before him, speakingto him and telling him of the future. It is regarding this mystery that our sages say,“Great is the power of the prophets, since they liken a form to its Creator.”141Rabbi [Abraham] ibn Ezra (1089–1164) likewise taught, “He who hears is a man,and he who speaks is a man.”142Regarding this, another sage writes:Through letter combinations and meditation (hitbodedut), I had a number ofexperiences. One involved a light, that followed me wherever I went, as I discussed inShaarey Tzedek (Gates of Righteousness). However, I was never worthy of attaining alevel where I could see my own image standing in front of me.Still another sage writes:I am aware how insignificant I am, and I realize that I am certainly not a prophet ora disciple of the prophets. I have neither attained Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit), norhave I made use of a heavenly voice (Bat Kol). Of such things, I have not been worthy,for I have not divested myself of my “cloak” or “washed my feet.”143 But I call heavenand earth as my witnesses, that this account is true.One day, I was sitting and writing mysteries in the manner of Truth. Suddenly, itwas as if I had ceased to exist. I then saw my own image standing in front of me. As aresult of this, I was forced to stop writing.In his commentary on the Guide to the Perplexed, Rabbi Moshe of Narbonne (d.1362) writes:144"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"When the sages teach that the prophets “liken a form to its Creator,” they mean thatthey liken the form which is in the prophet's own soul... to its Creator, that is, to God.It is thus written, “Over the form of the Throne there was a form like an image of aMan” (Ezekiel 1:26). These forms and images exist in the soul of the prophet. . . .This also happened to us when we were writing this book. Once, in the lateafternoon, we were placing the vowel points on the Explicit Name. All at once, oureyes were confronted with visions, appearing like definite forms made of red fire. Thisoccurred a number of times while we were writing this book.9. THE LADDER OF ASCENTThe teachings of Abulafia are known to have come to the Holy Land through theauthor of Shaarey Tzedek, and it appears that they took firm root there. Over twohundred years later, we find one of the prominent sages of the Holy Land, a chief rabbiof Jerusalem, involved in these mysteries and authoring an important book onAbulafia's teachings. This is none other than Rabbi Judah Albotini (1453–1519), authorof Sulam HaAliyah (Ladder of Ascent).Albotini is known to Talmudic scholars as the author of a supercommentary onMaimonides' commentary on the Mishnah. This was published by Rabbi Shlomo Idni(1567–1626), author of another important commentary on the Mishnah.145 Written in1501, this supercommentary is included in the most important edition of the Mishnah.Not as well-known is Albotini's monumental commentary on Maimonides' code, whichexists only in manuscript.146Not too much is known of the personal life of Albotini, other than the fact that hisfather, Moshe Albotini, was a prominent scholar in Lisbon. It is highly probable thatthe family was exiled in 1496, during the general expulsion of Jews from Portugal.This is significant, since Rabbi Judah Chayit, a strong opponent of Abulafia'steachings, also left Portugal during this same expulsion. The fact that Chayit found itnecessary to denounce Abulafia's writings indicates that they enjoyed a degree ofpopularity in his homeland.Albotini migrated to the Holy Land, and by 1509, we find him as a member of theJerusalem academy, where he signed an ordinance exempting scholars from the headtax. He succeeded Rabbi Jacob of Triel as head of the Jerusalem Academy, making himthe official head of all the Rabbis of Jerusalem. It would appear that Abulafia's schoolof meditative Kabbalah was sufficiently accepted in Jerusalem at the time that apractitioner and teacher of these methods could be chosen as a chief Rabbi. A shorttime later, we find another teacher of these methods, Rabbi Joseph Tzayach, alsoholding a rabbinical post in Jerusalem.A manuscript of Sulam HaAliyah was in the hands of the great Kabbalist, RabbiSasoon bekhor Moshe Presiado (d. 1903), and from what he writes, he actually"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"intended to publish it.147 Although he never succeeded in doing so, a number of keychapters have been published in scholarly journals. Several manuscripts of this bookexist, both in libraries and in private collections.148In this book, Albotini speaks about the Meditative Kabbalists (MeKubalimHaMitbodedim), as if they were a well-established group in his time.149 Speakingabout other books on the subject of letter manipulation (tzeruf) that had recently beenwritten, he warns that they contain many errors.150 He is thoroughly familiar withAbulafia's system, upon many of whose teachings he expands, presenting them in aclear and well-ordered manner. In two places, he mentions Abulafia's Chayay OlamHaBah (Life of the Future World) by name.151The first few chapters of the book deal mostly with word and letter manipulation(tzeruf), drawing heavily on Abulafia's works. Because this involves the letters of theHebrew alphabet, it is virtually impossible to do justice to this method in English. Theindividual interested in pursuing the subject further can find an excellent summary inthe published works of the Ramak.152Another idea that Albotini discusses in detail is that of “jumping” (kefitzah) and“skipping” (dilug). Although this is mentioned by Abulafia, and the method wasundoubtedly used by him, he does not present a clear picture how one makes use ofit.153 Albotini not only clearly describes these techniques within Abulafia's system ofTzeruf, but he also provides a number of examples showing how they are used.Briefly, “skipping” consists of a sort of free association, using any one of thestandard methods of letter manipulation. This can consist of simple letter permutation,the use of ciphers, or finding other words with similar numerical values (gematria).Words can also be expanded in a number of ways, the simplest being to spell outdifferent letters of the word. As long as one is making use of a single system, such asgematria for example, he is said to be “skipping.” When he goes from one system ofletter manipulation to another, then he is said to be “jumping.” All of this was seen asan important meditative technique through which one could attain a high level ofenlightenment.154An important prerequisite for attaining the meditative experience is stoicism(hishtavut,, ) and this is discussed at great length by Albotini.155 This has beendiscussed by a number of later kabbalists, but Abulafia only speaks about it in passing,writing, “One who has attained true passion (cheshek), is not influenced by theblessings or curses of others. It is as if they were speaking in a language that he doesnot understand.”156 Albotini's teachings regarding stoicism, however, seems to comefrom Rabbi Isaac of Acco, who speaks of this idea at length. This is of particularsignificance, since it would indicate that Albotini was a student of Rabbi Isaac of Accoas well as of Abulafia."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Albotini also expands on Abulafia's discussion of Hewing (chatzivah) and Engraving(chakikah), mentioned in the Sefer Yetzirah. When a person reaches a high meditativelevel, “the mind is no longer concealed in the prison of the physical faculties, and itemerges . . . entering the spiritual domain.” In this domain, the individual may seevarious visions or letter combinations, and the connotation of Hewing is that he“splits” and analyzes these visions while still in a meditative state. Engraving thenimplies that he “engraves” these revelations in his soul so that they are neverforgotten.157Although Albotini speaks of a number of standard meditative techniques, Albotinimaintained that any proper teaching could serve as the subject of one's meditation. Hethus writes, “Those who meditate (hitboded), concentrate on an idea or on a very deeplesson. They close their eyes, and virtually nullify all their faculties in order to allowtheir hidden intellect to emerge from potential to action. They then absorb the lesson,permanently engraving it in their soul.”158Through the use of Divine Names in meditation, one can channel extremelypowerful spiritual forces. Albotini writes that Moses made use of this to save Israel,and that, “with the power of the Divine Names, which he pronounced in his prayers, hewas able to turn back the anger and fury.”159 More remarkable, he states that the TenMartyrs could have saved themselves by using these Names, and that the sages couldhave even prevented the destruction of Jerusalem at the hand of the Babylonians andRomans. But, seeing that this had been God's decree, they refrained from doinganything.The Talmud speaks of three oaths that Israel made not to improperly hasten thecoming of the Messiah. This is based on the verse, “I bind you by an oath, O daughtersof Jerusalem, . . . that you not awaken, that you not arouse the love, until it is desired”(Song of Songs 3:5).160 There has been much discussion of this oath, and some rabbishave even used it as a refutation of Zionism.Albotini provides a very novel interpretation of this oath, saying that the greatmasters of Kabbalah meditation were bound by an oath not to use their methods tohasten the redemption. He thus writes, “Even though the coming of the Messiah is agreat concept, necessary for the rectification of all Universes, the sages and saints whoknew the mystery of God's name were bound by an oath not to arouse the redemptionuntil they knew that God desired that it should occur.”161In general, Albotini warns against pronouncing any of the Divine Names, even thosediscussed by Abulafia. Anticipating the Ari, he understands that, while earliergenerations may have been able to purify themselves sufficiently so that they couldactually pronounce the Names, later generations are no longer able to do this. But still,he maintains that it is not actually necessary to pronounce the Names, and that muchcan be accomplished by merely knowing them and pondering their significance."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"This is evidenced from the verse, “He was enraptured in Me, I will bring him forth, Iwill raise him up, because he knew My Name” (Psalms 91:14). Albotini notes that theverse does not say, “he pronounces My name,” but rather, it says, “he knows Myname.” He concludes, “from this we see that the main thing is the knowledge of theDivine Names, of their existence, essence, and meaning.”162 A similar explanation isalso provided to the verse, “Before they call I will answer them” (Isaiah 65:24). “Eventhough one concentrates on a given name and only thinks about it, without calling' andactually pronouncing it, he will be answered.”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUROther Early Schools1. THE GATE OF KsAVANAHAlthough much of the early explicit material regarding Kabbalah meditation stemsfrom Abulafia's writings, there were also a number of other schools contemporary tohim. The most important was the school in Provence, France, which was heir to themystical teachings of the Bahir, and eventually published this book in the late 1100's.Until the Twelfth Century, the Kabbalah had been a carefully concealed mystery, inthe hands of a few very small and restricted secret societies. So hidden were these thatsome of the greatest rabbinical leaders were not even aware of their existence. The firstones to break this silence were the great Kabbalists of Provence.The earliest known members of this school were Isaac and Jacob Nazir, both ofLunel. The title Nazir indicated that they had separated themselves from all worldlyactivities, devoting all their time to worship and the study of the Torah. Thecommunity supported a number of such individuals, creating an atmosphere where thecontemplative life necessary for the teaching of the Kabbalah and its methods couldflourish.Another important member of this group was Rabbi David ben Isaac, head of therabbinical court, whose son was the famed Raavad (Rabbi Abraham ben David ofPosqueres, 1120–1198), renowned as the author of the standard gloss on Maimonides'Code. A master of the mystical arts, the Raavad received the tradition from his father,as well as from his father-in-law, the famed Rabbi Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne,best known as the author of the Eshkol. In his legal commentaries, the Raavad actuallywrites that his school was subject to divine inspiration and the revelations ofmysteries.1The Raavad's son, known as Isaac the Blind, inherited leadership of the school fromhis father, and brought it to Provence. Even though he was blind, he was reputed to beable to look into a person's soul and see his thoughts. In his commentary on the Torah,Rabbi Bachya ben Asher (1276–1340) calls him the “father of Kabbalah.”2Rabbi Isaac the Blind had two disciples, Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel, both ofGerona. They assumed leadership of the school, and authored a number of veryinteresting books on the Kabbalah. It is from them that the Kabbalah tradition passedto the Ramban (Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, Nachmanides, 1194–1270), one of themost important religious scholars and leaders of that period."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"It is most probably from Rabbi Azriel of Gerona that we have one of the very fewworks describing the meditative methods used by the Provence school. This is theShaar HaKavanah LeMekubalim HaRishonim (The Gate of Kavanah of the EarlyKabbalists). This short essay exists in a large number of manuscripts, and isreproduced in its entirety in the unpublished Fourth Section of Rabbi Chaim Vital'sShaarey Kedushah.3 Here, we find a system of meditation very different than that ofAbulafia, even though it appears that he was aware of it.This text speaks of Kavanah () in a very remarkable context. The word itself isvery difficult to translate, having a number of important connotations. At varioustimes, the word Kavanah has been defined as concentration, attention, devotion, andintention. It actually means all of these things and more, the sum being greater than itsparts. In many places in this book, we have translated Kavanah as “concentration.”Here, however, it appears to have the connotation of actual meditation, and a similaruse of the word seems to be found in the writings of the Ari.The Gate of Kavanah speaks of meditation based on light, where one elevates themind from one light to a higher one. It is significant to note that two of these lights arecalled Bahir (brilliant) and Zohar, (radiant), alluding to the two most importantKabbalistic classics.4 One ascends until he reaches the Infinite, which is called Ain Sof(). Since one reaches this level by meditating on light, the highest level is oftenspoken of as the Infinite Light (Or Ain Sof) in Kabbalistic literature. There isconsiderable speculation as to the symbolism of light in the spiritual realm, but fromthis text, it appears to be related primarily to the meditative technique through which itis visualized.Although a number of different types of light are mentioned in this brief essay, theyare not clearly defined. The Gate of Kavanot, however, appears to have been well-known to Rabbi Moshe de Leon (1238–1305), best known as the publisher of theZohar. In his Shekel HaKodesh (Holy Coin), written in 1292, he clearly explains themeaning of these types of light. It is significant to note that although the Zohar speaksof different colors with regard to fire, its system appears quite different from that of itspublisher.5Correspondence Between the Lights and the Sefirot"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Gate of Kavanah6When a person sets his mind on something, its essence returns to him.Therefore, if you wish to pray, or if you wish to grasp the true nature of an idea, dothe following:Imagine that you yourself are light, and that all of your surroundings, on every side,are also light.In the middle of this light is a Throne of light.Above this Throne is a light called Nogah (Glow).7Facing this is [another] Throne. Above the [second Throne] is a light called Tov(Good).8You are standing between the two.If you wish to take revenge, turn to the Nogah.If you wish to seek mercy, turn to the Tov.The words that you speak should be directed toward [this light].Now turn yourself to the right of it, and there you will find [another] light. This is alight that is called Bahir (Brilliant).9To its left you will [also] find a light. This is a light called Zohar (Radiant).10Above these two, directly between them, is a light called Kavod (Glory).Around it is a light called Chaim (Life).Above it is the Crown.This is the light that crowns the desires of the mind and illuminates the paths of theimagination, enhancing the radiance (zohar) of the vision. This light has no end, and itcannot be fathomed. From the glory (Kavod) of its perfection comes desire, blessing,peace, life (chaim), and all good (tov) to those who keep the way of its unification.It is hidden from those who stray from the path of this light, and is transformed intoits precise opposite.

One must know how to trim away the surrounding fringes, the conscious desires[which draw him away] from the primary goal. These all come from the individualhimself, and he can therefore elevate himself above them through the power of hisconcentration.He can then probe very deeply, and break away from the crooked path.11 Throughthe power of his meditation, the individual can then blaze a new path.He elevates himself over them12 with the power of his concentration, which comesfrom the glory (kavod) of the perfection of the Concealed Light.

The divine influx can then be transmitted inorder to perfect him.The lower will is not perfected when the individual approaches for his own needs.Rather, one must approach while clothed in the will and desire to reveal theidentification that is hidden in the concealed Mystery.13When one approaches in this manner, the Highest Will then brings itself close to"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"him. It increases his power and motivates his will until he can accomplish anything.This will even include things that he himself desires, in which the Highest Will doesnot have any portion.Regarding this it is written, “He who strives for good shall seek the Will” (Proverbs11:27). For according to the degree of one's attachment in the proper manner to theHighest Will, this Will clothes itself in him. Then, through the power of hisconcentration, it transmits to him anything that he desires.One is thus able to transmit the influx that crowns the Hidden Desires and essences,with the way of Wisdom, the spirit of Understanding, and the power of Knowledge.14The individual must be clothed in spirit (ruach), expressing his concentration withwords, and making a symbolic act. According to how he does this, the influx will betransmitted from potential to potential, from cause to cause, until the result iscompleted according to his will.It was in this manner that the early [saints] would linger an hour before praying.15During this period, they would dispel all other thoughts, fixing the paths of theirconcentration and the power of its direction.They would then spend an hour in prayer, verbally expressing this concentrationwith words. Finally, they would spend an hour after their prayers, contemplating howthe power of their verbally expressed concentration would have a visible effect.[The Talmud thus teaches that] “Since they were saints (Hasidim), their Torahlearning preserved itself and their work blessed itself.”16This is one of the ways of prophecy. One who accustoms himself to it will be worthyof attaining the prophetic level.17An Excerpt From the Works ofRabbi Moshe de LeonThe four appearances of light are the radiant (zohar) lights which are hidden andconcealed. These come into being from the mysterious reality of [God's] essence,which is also hidden and concealed.This is like the glow (nogah) that surrounds the eye's vision in the concealed sphereof radiance (zohar). It is not openly seen.This sphere [of radiance] stands between four [paths of] concentration (kavanah)involving this glow (nogah). These involve the light that is Scintilating (Muvhak),Brilliant (Bahir), Radiant (Zohar), like the “radiance of the sky.”18There are four type of radiance (zohar).

These are red fire, yellow fire, white fire, and black fire.19 God told Mosesabout these four types of fire, and showed them to him on Mount Sinai.These four types of fire parallel the four luminations under discussion. In a mysticalsense, these four lights are the four “lights of the hosts” [that God showed Moses].20The light under discussion, however, is hidden and concealed. It rotates the trueZohar light when the light [seen by] the closed eye rotates.This is a hidden light that is never revealed. It cannot be seen in any way, other thanin a concealed manner.It is regarding this hidden, concealed light that [Moses] said, “Show me YourGlory” (Exodus 33:18).This is the Light that gives rise to the four luminations under discussion, which areBahir light, Zohar light, Muvhak light, and light that receives Zohar. These are thelights that can be seen.Bahir light is the Shining Glass (Ispaklaria), which has the power to reflect.21Zohar light is a glass that absorbs light. It then cannot be recognized except when itis revealed near a shining light.Muvhak light is a Shining Glass in which the color of all lights is recognizable.Through its colors, all other Glasses are illuminated.Light that receives Zohar is a Glass that does not shine. It receives all the otherlights like a reflector that receives the radiance (zohar) of the sun, and it can berecognized in it.The same is true of the light that receives Zohar. This light absorbs all other colors,and they are then visible inside it. When other colors come near it and shine into it, itabsorbs them and gathers them in. The mark of each one is then recognizable in it.This light is more readily revealed, since it is not very bright. Zohar light, on theother hand, is so bright that the eye cannot grasp it in any way.

Light that is lessbright, however, can be grasped and revealed, and the eye is able [to see] it.Whoever looks at this color can recognize the other colors, which are hidden andconcealed in it, and which stand over it.Contemplate that the other, higher colors can be recognized inside it.

GATES OF LIGHTOne of the most important teachings of the Kabbalah involves the Ten Sefirot(Divine Emanations). It is therefore surprising to find that they hardly seem to find anyplace in Kabbalah meditation. Although there are some allusions, they are usuallytenuous at best. There are a number of hints that the great early Kabbalists meditatedon the Sefirot, using them as a ladder to reach the highest levels, but very little ismentioned about the method that they used. In general the early literature is silentabout the relationship between meditation and the Sefirot.There is, however, one important exception. This is a remarkable book ShaareyOrah (Gates of Light), by Rabbi Joseph Gikatalia (1248–1323).Considered as one of the greatest Kabbalists of all time, Gikatalia was born inMedina Celi in Castile. It was there that, as a young man, he came under the influenceof Abulafia, who apparently taught him his entire system. Shortly after this, he wrotehis first book, Cinat Egoz (The Nut Garden), a title suggested by the verse, “I wentdown into the nut garden” (Song of Songs 6:11). Besides this, the word Ginat () is anacronym of Gematria Notrikion Temurah, three important methods of lettermanipulation used by Abulafia. It is significant to note that the word Ginat is used inthe same manner by Rabbi Baruch Targomi, one of Abulafia's teachers.25Gikatalia's most important work, however, was his Shaarey Orah, which has beenpublished in over a dozen editions. This book consists of an exposition of the TenSefirot and the Ten Divine Names that are associated with them. Strongly influencedby the Bahir, Shaarey Orah can actually be considered to be a key to this ancientKabbalah classic. The Ari calls Shaarey Orah the key to the mystical teachings.The Sefirot and Associated Names of God"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"At first, Shaarey Orah seems to be just another book on the theoretical Kabbalah,without any practical application. In a number of places, however, the author hints atthe practical applications of this system. At the end of the book, he explicitly states, “Ihave given over to you ten keys, and with them you can enter gates that are otherwiseclosed.”"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Upon close examination, then, the book can be taken as a guide for those who wishto ascend spiritually through meditation on the ladder of the Sefirot. Indeed, in theunpublished Fourth Part of his Shaarey Kedushah, Rabbi Chaim Vital presents twoselections from this book in precisely this light.26 Abulafia might also have beenalluding to this method when he speaks of using the Ten Names in meditation.27When examined in this light, Shaarey Orah can be seen in its entirety as a guide tomeditation on the Sefirot. The words and Divine Names associated with the Sefirot canbe viewed as guides, helping one to meditate on particular Sefirot. They providemental or verbal images upon which one can meditate, although the precise method ofdoing so is not explicitly defined. A chart of the Sefirot, as presented in Shaarey Orah,along with the Divine Names associated with them is provided here.It is interesting to note that this book also exerted a profound influence on the“Christian Kabbalists.” In 1516, forty-five years before the first Hebrew edition wasprinted, a Latin translation was published. This had been translated by Paul Ricci, andit came to the attention of the Christian mystic, Johann Reuchlin (1455–1522). When agroup of Dominicans tried to convince Pope Leo X to confiscate and burn all Jewishbooks, Reuchlin made use of the Latin version of Shaarey Orah to convince the Popeof the value of Judaic teachings. As one of the few Kabbalistic works published intranslation, Shaarey Orah exerted a powerful influence on many occult groups inEurope.There are a number of places where Shaarey Orah speaks specifically aboutmeditative techniques, and these will be presented here.Excerpts FromThe Gates of LightYou have asked me, my brother, beloved of my soul, to enlighten you regarding thepath involving God's names so that through them you will gain what you wish andreach what you desire. Since I see that your intent is upright and good, I will go beyondyour request and show you where the Light can be found, explaining what God desiresand what He does not desire. When you grasp this knowledge, then you will be amongthose close to God — “You will call, and God will answer” (Jeremiah 58:9).The earlier sages had many Holy Names, which they had received as a traditionfrom the Prophets. These included the Name of Seventy-Two, the Name of Forty-Two,the Name of Twelve, and many other Holy Names. Through these names, they wereable to bring about miracles and wonders, but they never used them for their ownneeds. Such was reserved for a time of evil decree, or to sanctify God's holy Name....The boundary of truth and the tradition of the covenant is this.

He will then be close to God, and his prayers will be answered.Regarding this, it is written, “I will raise him up because he knows My Name”(Psalms 91:14). The verse does not say, “I will answer him,” but “I will raise him up.”Furthermore, it does not say, “because he pronounced My Name,” but “because heknows My Name.” This is because the main thing is knowledge.28[When a person has such a knowledge,] then he can call and God will answer him.This means that when he needs something and concentrates on the Name associatedwith his need, he will be answered.29. . .The first Name is closest to all created things. It is through this Name that oneenters the presence of God the King. Other than through this Name, there is no otherway whatsoever that one can see the face of the Blessed King.This Name is Adonoy (). [It is the name associated with Malkhut-Kingship, thelowest Sefirah.]The Unique Name, YHVH (), denotes the essence of our Blessed Creator, andeverything depends on it. However, the first gate, and the opening through which oneenters to reach God, is the Name Adonoy.This is the lowest level of the Divine. From the level of Adonoy and above, we findthe mystery of Unity. . . . Below this is the world of separation. . . .The Name Adonoy is like a storehouse and a treasury. It holds all influx and everyemanation that is transmitted through all spiritual channels from YHVH.There are three names, one above the other. Adonoy is on the bottom, YHVH is inthe middle, and Ehyeh is on top. It is from the Name Ehyeh that all kinds of sustenanceemanate, coming from the Source, which is the Infinite (Ain Sof). It then proceedsthrough a series of steps until it reaches the blessed name, YHVH. From the NameYHVH all spiritual channels flow and the flux is transmitted to the name Adonoy. TheName Adonoy is therefore the storehouse containing all of the King's devices, and it isthe essence that distributes these to all creation. It nourishes and sustains all things,through the power of YHVH that is in it.It is by the order [of Adonoy] that all who approach to attach themselves to YHVHmay enter and leave. There is absolutely no way that one can attach himself to YHVH"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"except through Adonoy.[Adonoy] is therefore the treasury of the Unique Name [YHVH] It is the Palace inwhich YHVH dwells.30 It is for this reason that whenever the name YHVH appears inthe Torah, it is read as Adonoy. This is because one who seeks YHVH only finds it inthe name Adonoy.There are a total of 54 ways in which the four letters of YHVH can be permuted.[Since each of these permutations contains four letters] all of them yield a total of 216letters. These 54 names are the mystery of the transmission of power to all that exists,in all creation. They are like a soul to the 216 letters of the Name of Seventy-TwoTriplets.31. . .One who attaches himself to [Adonoy] is worthy of eternal life. This is alluded to inthe verse, “And you, who are attached to YHVH your God, you are all alive today”(Deuteronomy 4:4).Permutations of the TetragrammatonOur sages question this, and ask, “Is it then possible to attach oneself to the DivinePresence?”32 Although their question is valid, this is only true in a homeletic sense. Ina mystical sense, one can indeed attach himself.God therefore said, “You shall fear YHVH your God, Him shall you serve, and toHim you shall attach yourself” (Deuteronomy 10:20).. . .Know and believe that there is a method involving the mystical purification of thelimbs, through which it is possible for a human being to attach himself to the DivinePresence, even though it is a “consuming fire.”33 Actually, it is a fire that providesdelight and ecstasy to those who attach themselves to it with a pure soul.It is therefore called the Lamp of God. It is what lights the Lamp of the Soul. The"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"soul is then attached to it, and this is its desire.34. . .One who wishes to perceive Eternal Life should attach himself to the attribute of ElChai (Living God), [which is associated with the Sefirah of Yesod-Foundation].This means that through his prayers, one should bring El Chai into Adonoy. It wasregarding this that King David had passion and desire when he said, “My soul thirstsfor God, for El Chai” (Psalms 42:3).When the attribute (Yesod), which is called El Chai, is bound to Adonoy (Malkhut),then one can draw down all his needs. He can overcome his enemies, and no one canstand up to him. . . .We must bind the Sefirot together, attaching all levels through the attribute ofAdonoy (Malkhut-Kingship). We therefore say, “He chooses song of praise, King(Malkhut), Life (Yesod) of the world.”35 If one wishes to seek a good life, he shouldbind himself to the attribute of El Chai.When a person is attached to Adonoy in purity, then he is also attached to El Chai. Itis thus written, “And you, who are attached to YHVH your God, you are all alive(Chai) today” (Deuteronomy 4:4).36. . .If one wishes to attain these three things, [life, food or children], he cannot attainthem as a matter of right in this world. They cannot be attained through merit, which[involves] the Tribunal on high.How then can he attain these things?One must elevate his concentration (kavanah) higher and higher. He must probedeeper than the Future World (Binah-Understanding), until he reaches the level ofKeter-Crown, which is Ehyeh, which is [associated with] the Infinite (Ain Sof).One thus reaches the level of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. One of theseThirteen Attributes is called Destiny (mazal, ) The sages therefore teach, “Life,children and food do not depend on merit, but on Destiny.”37There is one thing that you must know and understand. Even though we say that onewho wishes to attain what he desires from God should concentrate on a particularDivine Name, this does not mean that he should concentrate on that name and go nofarther.But the true intent is this: One must concentrate on the Name associated with thething that he needs. He must then elevate his concentration on that Name until the topof the Ten Sefirot. He then reaches the Highest Source, which is called the Source ofDesire. When one reaches the Source of Desire, then his request and the desire of hisheart are fulfilled.This is the meaning of the verse, “You open Your hand (yad-ekha), and satisfy all"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"life desire”(Psalms 145:16). Do not read Yadekha ()— “Your hand” — but Yod-ekha()— “Your Yod.”38 This means that God opens the mystery of the Yod () in thename YHVH (), which is the Source of Desire. He then fulfills the desire of all whoask.One who wishes to attain from God what he desires must contemplate the TenSefirot. He must transmit Will and Desire from the highest to lowest, until he brings itto the Final Desire, which is the name Adonoy. The Sefirot are then blessed throughhim, and he is blessed through the Sefirot.This is the mystery of the verse, “He who blesses himself on earth (Malkhut),blesses himself by the God of Amen” (Isaiah 65:16). The word Amen () alludes tothe mystery through which blessing is transmitted from the names Ehyeh and YHVH tothe name Adonoy.From this you learn that when one prays, he must concentrate in the manner that Ihave described. He must unify the Sefirot, and bring them close to each other. . . .When a person prays, he must concentrate and ascend from Sefirah to Sefirah, fromdesire to desire. He must continue in this manner until in his heart he reaches theSource of the Highest Will, which is called the Infinite (Ain Sof).King David therefore said, “A song of steps, from the depths I call You O God(YHVH)” (Psalms 130:1). He is saying that he is calling God from His depths, that is,from the highest source, which is called the Infinite (Ain Sof). This is the depth whichis the apex of the Yod of YHVH. He therefore said, “From the depths I call YouYHVH.”And how does one concentrate?One does so through a series of steps in an upward direction. He enters through thefinal Heh () of the Name [which is associated with Malkhut-Kingship]. He thenascends from attribute to attribute, from Sefirah to Sefirah, until his mind elevatesitself to the apex of the Yod, which is Keter-Crown. This is called the Infinite (AinSof), and it is the mystery of “the depths.” [King David therefore called this] “A songof steps.” . . .These “depths” denote everything that is hidden, concealed, and difficult to grasp. Itis therefore written, “That which was is far off, deep, deep, who can find it”(Ecclesiastes 7:24). The great mystery that includes all this is the verse, “Very deep areYour thoughts” (Psalms 92:6). You already know that the mystery of thought is theYod of the Name YHVH. . . .Now that we have taught you this, we can return to the main idea. When oneconcentrates, he must focus all his thoughts, until with absolute concentration, hereaches the Source of Will. This is the apex of the Yod, and it is the Depth of Thought.Regarding this it is written, “from the depths I call You, O God.”39. . ."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Tetragrammaton, YHVH, is like the trunk of a tree, while the other divineNames are like its branches.40. . .The Name YHVH is occasionally connected to Adonoy.Sometimes YHVH comes first, and is followed by Adonoy. An example of this isthe verse, “YHVH Adonoy is my strength, he makes my feet like hinds” (Habakkuk3:19). Another example is, “God is to us a God of deliverance, and to YHVH Adonoyare the issues of death” (Psalms 68:21). Still another is, “My eyes are to You, YHVHAdonoy, in You I have taken refuge” (Psalms 141:8).When the two names are pronounced together, YHVH is not read as Adnoy, but asElohim. This alludes to the attribute of Binah-Understanding, which is being unitedwith the attribute of Malkhut-Kingship, which is called Adonoy. Through Binah, it isunified with YHVH.When one pronounces YHVH Adonoy (Elohim Adonoy) in this order, the influxdescends through all the Sefirot, from the highest to the lowest, until the influx ofblessing and essence reaches the name Adonoy. When this occurs, all the world isenhanced with a perfect blessing.At other times, Adonoy is pronounced first, followed by YHVH. An example of thisis, “Abraham said: Adonoy YHVH, what will You give me” (Genesis 15:2). Anotherexample is, “Adonoy YHVH, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness”(Deuteronomy 3:24). Still another is, “Adonoy YHVH, destroy not Your people”(Deuteronomy 9:26).When the Name is pronounced Adonoy YHVH (Adonoy Elohim), it denotes themystery of the ascent of the Sefirot and their unification with one another, until aperson's concentration reaches the Source of Will.This is like an individual who wishes to grasp a place in the supernal Light andattach himself to it. The name Adonoy (Malkhut-Kingship) yearns to elevate itself andgrasp on to Binah-Understanding. YHVH is then vocalized as Elohim.When the name is written YHVH Adonoy, it denotes the mystery of the divineinflux of Binah-Understanding, which descends through the channels and reaches thename Adonoy. When this happens, all the universe is blessed.41. . .The great, glorious, fearsome name, YHVH, is a name that included all the otherdivine names that are mentioned in the Torah. There is no divine name that is notincluded in the name YHVH.Realizing this, you must be aware how careful you must be when you pronounce thisname. When you pronounce the name YHVH, you take on your lips all the holy names.It is then as if your mouth and tongue are carrying all the holy names, upon whichdepend the universe and everything in it."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"When you realize this, you will understand the mystery of the [Third]Commandment, “You shall not take the name of YHVH your God in vain” (Exodus20:7). For how can a lowly, insignificant creature take on his tongue the great nameYHVH which upholds all creation, both on high and below. Even more so, [how canone use it for his own needs], as an ax with which to cut? . . .You must realize that when one pronounces the name YHVH, sounding out itsletters with the motions of his tongue, he agitates all the universes, both on high andbelow. All the angels rise up and ask each other, “Why is the universe trembling?” Andthey answer, “Because some wicked person is pronouncing the Explicit Name,sounding it out with his lips. As a result of these vibrations, every name and appelationthat depends on it, reverberate, and heaven and earth tremble.”Then they say, “And who is this wicked person who makes the universe tremble,pronouncing the Great Name without reason? He is this wicked person, who did thesesins on this day, and those misdeeds another day.” As a result, all of this individual'ssins are recalled.When you shake the trunk of a tree, you cause all of its branches and leaves totremble. Likewise, when a person pronounces the name YHVH, all the host on high andbelow tremble, since they all depend on it.The only place where this was not true was in the Holy Temple. When the HighPriest would pronounce this Name in the Temple, all the host of heaven would rejoiceand would receive the divine influx. For in doing this, the High Priest would rectify allthe supernal channels, and blessing would be brought to everything in the universe.42. . .Many saints were afraid to touch the attribute of Adonoy when it was alone. Theywould therefore transmit love and good to it from the highest Keter-Crown and fromthe other Names associated with mercy. King David did this, when he said, “But YouAdonoy (Malkhut-Kingship) are El (Chesed-Love), full of compassion and mercy,slow to anger, with great love and truth. Turn to me and have mercy on me” (Psalms86:15).If you understand this, you will enter many chambers. You will know how theprophets and saints would direct the channels of love and mercy to the name Adonoy,so that they would not enter into it when it was dry and empty.It was in this manner that the Talmudic sages knew how to rectify the channels anddirect all the Names associated with mercy, until everything would be transmitted intothe name Adonoy. Since they knew how to concentrate through all the channels to thename Adonoy, they could do anything they wished in the world.43. . .The blessed name, YHVH, which is the mystery of the Middle Pillar, is called Atah(Thou). This is the mystery of all of God's banners and appelations. He clothes Himself"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"in them all, and prides Himself in them, this being the mystery of the word Atah.This mystery teaches that everything in the universe, and every Merkava, wascreated through permutations of the letters of the alphabet. This is the Kabbalahtradition found in the Sefer Yetzirah, which speaks of the permutation and cycling ofthe letters.Through the permutations of the 22 alphabets, heaven and earth, and all their host,on high and below, were created. Know this and ponder it carefully. . . .Letter permutations are therefore a door to the most profound depths. Through them,he can discern the depth of Wisdom, and the wonder of the creation of everything thatwas formed, each thing according to its kind. He can also discern the structure of everyMerkava, and the mystery of every male and female.The permutations and cyclings of the 22 letters are all concealed in the mystery ofthe word Atah (). [The first two letters of this word are Alef () and Tav (),] thefirst and last letters of the alphabet, and the beginning and end of every Merkava.This is the meaning of what the Sefer Yetzirah says, “Ten Sefirot of Nothingness,their end is embedded in their beginning, and their beginning in their end, like a flamebound to a coal.”44All this is the mystery of the 22 letters, and the five channels of Binah-Understanding. Through these all forms of the Merkava are depicted, as well as allthings, both on high and below.This is the mystery of the Torah. It is written with the 22 letters, and consists of FiveBooks. [Five is the numerical value of Heh (), the last letter of Atah.] All of thesetogether, [the Alef (), the Tav (), and the Heh ()], spell out Atah ().45Contemplate on the keys that I have given you here. With them, you can open manygates, sealed with many locks, since everyone is not worthy to enter through them.46. . .The Sefirah [of Chokhmah-Wisdom] is called Somethingness in the Torah. Thereason for this is that the first Sefirah, Keter-Crown, is hidden from the eyes of all.Since no one can contemplate it, it is called Nothingness. . . .If a person seeks [Keter-Crown] he will find Nothingness. No one can contemplatethe depth of its depth and excellence. It is for this reason that it is not connotated byany letter in the alphabet, but only by the apex of the Yod.The beginning of thought, and the first revelation of the array, is the second Sefirah,which is called Chokhmah-Wisdom.47. . .Gazing at the Merkava is called a descent, and the sages therefore speak of“descending to the Merkava.”One who gazes in the Merkava must first ascend to the highest level, which is the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"place of the Light. It is here that he receives the influx of insight. Only then can hedescend and look into the Merkava.48. . .The Sefirah [of Chokhmah-Wisdom] is called Fear. The reason for this is that whena person's thoughts reach this high and deep place, he has reason to fear, lest histhoughts become confounded, running and meditating beyond the proper measure.Regarding this the Sefer Yetzirah says, “Ten Sefirot of Nothingness, close yourmouth that it not speak, and your heart that it not think. And if your heart runs, returnto your place.” One must return to his place, since he is entering a place of fear andterror when one thinks of its depth and essence. . . .Therefore, wherever you find the word Fear, contemplate that it is referring to theSefirah [of Chokhmah-Wisdom]. It is a place of fear, since it has no measure orboundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it. This alluded toin the verse, “He says to man, behold the fear of God is Wisdom, and to depart fromevil is Understanding” (Job 28:28).3. RABBI ISAAC OF ACCOA contemporary of both Abulafia and Gikatalia, Rabbi Isaac of Acco was the thirdgreat Kabbalist of that period to speak of meditation. Tlthough he does not provide anyclear examples of his methodology, he does speak of many important meditativeprinciples, and his writings have had an important influence on the meditativeKabbalists. Even more than Abulafia and Gikatalia, he was renowned as a master ofletter permutations, and Rabbi Chaim Vital taught that when Rabbi Isaac of Accowould practice the art of Tzeruf, he would be visited by angels.49Rabbi Isaac (1250–1340) was born in the Holy Land, and grew up in Acco, whichhad an important Jewish community. The city had come under the Kabbalisticinfluence of the Ramban (Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman), who had arrived in the HolyLand in 1267. Considered one of the brightest students in Acco, Rabbi Isaac studied inthe Academy of Rabbi Shlomo Petit, and there is some evidence that he also studiedwith the Ramban himself. It is interesting to note, that while Abulafia studied theGuide to the Perplexed under Rabbi Hillel of Verona, one of its staunchest defenders,Rabbi Isaac of Acco was a disciple of Rabbi Hillel's major opponent in the disputeraging over Maimonides' philosophical system.Living in Acco, Rabbi Isaac was surrounded by this controversy. His master, RabbiShlomo Petit, had seized on the fact that Maimonides both quoted and praisedAristotle. Since Aristotle's works are often diametrically opposed to the teachings ofJudaism, Petit condemned Maimonides' works as being heretical. He traveled toEurope, to gain support, seeking to place a ban on the learning or teaching of theGuide. Maimonides was not without his supporters, however, and the controversy"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"virtually tore the community of Acco into two opposing factions. Ultimately,Maimonides' supporters won out, and in the summer of 1289 a ban was pronouncedagainst Petit, proscribing any further attacks on the Guide. Testimonials in favor ofMaimonides' classic were sent to Barcelona, most probably to the Rashba.The city of Acco had long been an important scene of conflict between theCrusaders and the Saracens. It had finally been wrested from the Moslems in 1191 byKing Richard the Lion Hearted, and had subsequently enjoyed a century of peace,during which the Jewish community prospered. However, on May 18, 1291 (18 Sivan,5051), after a month of seige, it was retaken by the Saracen Almalek Alshraf, and agood portion of both the Jewish and Christian community was put to the sword. Theremainder of the populace was imprisoned, and included among them was Rabbi Isaacof Acco.It appears that Rabbi Isaac remained in the Holy Land for a few years after this.From there he went to Italy, where we find him in 1305. He then travelled throughToledo, and it was at this time that he met with Rabbi Moshe de Leon, publisher of theZohar.Although Isaac of Acco does not mention Abulafia by name, he is highly critical ofGikatalia's Ginat Egoz (Nut Garden), which was written under Abulafia's influence.Rabbi Isaac complains of Gikatalia's extensive use of Divine Names, and writes, “If Ihad not heard that he is Godfearing, I would say that when he does this, he is notamong those who do not fear God.”50 Later, however, when Gikatalia lived in Segovia,and probably after he had written Shaarey Orah (Gates of Light), Rabbi Isaac countshim among the greatest Kabbalists of his generation.51Since both Abulafia and Isaac of Acco were contemporaries who spoke ofmeditative techniques, it would be interesting to seek a connection between the two.One possiblity is that they both had the same teacher, Rabbi Baruch Targomi. I have afragment where Rabbi Isaac of Acco discusses the Seven Mystical Seals, which heattributes to Nohaniel Gaon (?), and which are elsewhere attributed to the Ramban.52Rabbi Isaac states that he heard an explanation as to the meaning of these seals from acertain Rabbi Baruch.53 In his commentary on the Torah, Rabbi Isaac likewise speaksof Rabbi Baruch in a number of places.54 It seems evident that this is the same RabbiBaruch Targomi who was Abulafia's teacher.There are a number of places where Rabbi Isaac's teachings seem to parallel those of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Abulafia. Both taught that prophecy can exist in any place, and that the Midrashicdoctrine that prophecy can only be attained in the Holy Land, is actually speaking of aspiritual level.55 The initial letters of the Hebrew words for “Beginning, Middle, End,”Rosh, Tokh, Sof (), spell out the word Seter () meaning “mystery,” andthis, too, is discussed by both in the same manner.56 The Name of Seventy-TwoTriplets contains a total of 216 letters, which is the numerical value of “Fear” (yirah, ) and “Lion” (Aryeh, ). This, too, appears in the works of both Abulafia andIsaac of Acco.57All of this could be coincidence, either discovered independently or the product ofindependent traditions. There is one gematria, however, which both of them use, andsince it involves a foreign word, it is difficult to imagine it coming from twoindependent traditions. The Talmud states that the angel Metatron () is calledNaar (), meaning a “youth” or “child,” since both words have a numerical value of320. Both Abulafia and Isaac of Acco point out that this is also the numerical value ofSheik () which in Arabic means an elder. Metatron the “youth,” is therefore actuallyan elder.58 It would be difficult to say that two individuals would independently arriveat the same gematria, and it therefore seems highly probable that Isaac of Acco eithertook it from Abulafia's writings or that they both received it from the same source.It is very possible that Rabbi Isaac learned of Abulafia's teachings from the authorof Shaarey Tzedek (Gates of Righteousness), who lived in the Holy Land. Both were inthe Holy Land at the same time, and there are important similarities between ShaareyTzedek and Isaac of Acco's Otzar Chaim (Treasury of Life). Thus, for example, bothbooks, speaking of man's inability to perceive the Divine, cite the example of a bat,who can see in the dark, but is blinded by daylight.59Another idea that is almost too similar to be coincidence involves the philosopherswho would use wine to help them resolve difficult problems, as discussed in ShaareyTzedek.60 Rabbi Isaac almost paraphrases this, writing, “I heard that when one of themost spiritual of the philosophical sages was confronted with a difficult problem, hewould drink a cup of strong wine, and fall asleep with his thoughts on that subject.While in a state of semi-sleep, full understanding would come to him, and then hewould awaken and write it down.”61 Since Otzar Chaim was written at least ten yearsafter Shaarey Tzedek, it is highly probable that Isaac of Acco saw this in the earliertext.One of Rabbi Isaac of Acco's important teachings involves Hishtavut (), a termderived from the root Shava (), meaning “equal.” The term denotes making allthings equal for oneself, and can be translated as equanimity, or more accurately, asstoicism. It involves total indifference to all outside influences good or bad. This isseen by Rabbi Isaac as a prerequisite for any true level of meditation, an idea that ismentioned by Abulafia, and discussed at length by Albotini.62"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The idea of Hishtavut is also found in earlier, non-Kabbalistic sources, the earliestbeng Chovot HaLevavot (Duties of the Heart), by Rabbi Bachya ibn Pakuda (1050–1120).63 Actually, however, this concept is also found in the Talmud, where it is called“overcoming one's [natural] tendencies.” Thus, the Talmud relates that the greatmystic, Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKana, the central figure of the Hekhalot, said that thiswas one of the main traits responsible for his attainments.64 The Talmud also teachesthat the mysteries involving the Name of Forty-Two can only be given over to one whohas attained this level of stoicism.65 In another place, the Talmud speaks of prayerbeing answered immediately in a mystical manner, and again states that the reason wasbecause the individual leading the prayers had been able to “overcome histendencies.”66The Talmud clearly states that those who attain this level of stoicism are able toradiate spiritually. It teaches, “Regarding those who are insulted but do not insult, whohear themselves scorned, but do not respond, who serve [God] with love and rejoice insuffering, it is written, ‘Those who love [God] shall be like the sun, when it shinesforth with [all] its strength’ (Judges 5:31).”67This teaching had a profound effect on later Kabbalists. It is discussed at length inSulam HaAliyah (Ladder of Ascent), and Isaac of Acco's primary teaching regardingthis is quoted in its entirety in the unpublished Fourth Part of Rabbi Chaim Vital'sShaarey Kedushah.68 A similar idea was taught to Rabbi Joseph Caro by his angelicteacher.It is significant to see that this very same idea is also found in early Hasidicteachings. The Baal Shem Tov, founder of the Hasidic movement, speaks at lengthregarding Hishtauwf-stoicism and states that this is the intent of the verse usuallytranslated as, “I have set (shivi-ti) God before me at all times” (Psalms 16:8).According to the Baal Shem, the word Shivi-ti (), instead of being translated, “Ihave set,” should be translated, “I have been stoic.” The verse then reads, “I have beenstoic, God is before me at all times.”At first this interpretation may seem far-fetched to Bible scholars, but actually, itmakes a number of other very difficult verses much more understandable. Thus,instead of, “I have placed (shivi-ti) and have quieted my soul” (Psalms 131:1), we cannow read this verse, “I have become stoic and have quieted my soul.” Another versewhere this interpretation fits well is, “i have chosen a path of faith, through Yourjudgments I have become stoic” (Psalms 119:30). The same is true of the verse inIsaiah, “i made myself stoic (shivi-ti) like a lion until morning” (Isaiah 38:13). In allthese verses, it would be very difficult to translate Shivi-ti as “i have placed.”In a number of places, Rabbi Isaac speaks of Mitbodedim () or “meditators”as if there were regular organized groups of these individuals.69 The very fact that somany Kabbalistic schools contemporary to him speak of various meditative techniques"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"also seems to support this. In a number of places, he also speaks of the science of lettercombination (tzeruf) citing this as an important means for attaining enlightenment.70Rabbi Isaac of Acco wrote a number of books, none of which were ever published,except for fragments in scholarly journals. His best known work is Meirat Eynayim(Light of the Eyes), a commentary on the Torah explaining the teachings of theRamban. Another important Kabbalistic work is his Otzar Chaim (Treasury of Life),which consists mostly of mysteries revealed to him while in a meditative state.71 Healso wrote commentaries on Sefer Yetzirah, and Pirkey Rabbi Eliezer, an ancientMidrash. Parts of these have been published in journals.72 Highly significant is hisautobiographical Divrey Yamim (Chronicles), which he mentions in his Otzar Chaim,but no manuscript of this exists.73 Also mentioned there is another work, ChaimDeOraita (Life of the Torah), which is not noted by historians, but may be the mysticalunknown book of his that is occasionally quoted by the Kabbalists.74TEACHINGSI, the insignificant Isaac, son of Solomon, of Acco, proclaim this both to individualsand the masses, who wish to know the mystery of binding one's soul on high.One can attach his thoughts to God, and when one does so consistently, there is noquestion that he will be worthy of the World to Come, and God's Name will be withhim constantly, both in this world and in the next.You should constantly keep the letters of the Unique Name in your mind as if theywere in front of you, written in a book with Torah (Ashurit) script. Each letter shouldappear infinitely large.When you depict the letters of the Unique Name () in this manner, your mind'seye should gaze on them, and at the same time, your heart should be directed towardthe Infinite Being (Ain Sof). Your gazing and thought should be as one.This is the mystery of true attachment, regarding which the Torah says, “To Himyou shall attach yourself” (Deuteronomy 10:20)."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"[If you are able to do this,] no evil will befall you, you will not be subject to errorscaused by logic or emotion, and you will not be the victim of accidents. As long as youare attached to God, you are above all accidents, and are in control of events.You must respect God, and be careful not to attach your thoughts to Him when youare not in a clean place. Do not do so in filthy alleys, when your hands are not clean, orwhen you are in the presence of idols.I heard the following from a pious sage who had served Rabbi Isaac [the Blind], sonof the Raavad (Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posqueres, 1120–1198):[Rabbi Isaac] had been born blind, and had never seen with his physical eyes.Whenever he would go any place, he would tell his attendant, “When we pass by aplace of idolalatry, quicken your pace as much as you can.”75It appears to me that this was done for the glory of God. His thoughts were alwaysbound to God, and because of the unclean spirit that dwells in the idols, he could notthink such thoughts [while in proximity to them]. This was a place of ultimateuncleanness, while his thoughts were on the Root of ultimate holiness. He wouldtherefore hurry away from there, so that he could return to his normal state of mind.You may ask why one should bind his thoughts to the Tetragrammaton more thanany other name. The reason is that this Name is the cause of causes and the source ofall sources. Included in it are all things, from Keter-Crown (the highest Sefirah) to thelowliest gnat. Blessed be the Name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever.It is regarding this name that the Psalmist said, “I have placed YHVH before me atall times” (Psalms 16:8). This alludes to what we have said, that his eyes and heartwere always directed toward God, and it is as if the Name (YHVH) was written beforehim.76 . . .When an individual is worthy of the mystery of Attachment (Devekut), he can alsobe worthy of the mystery of Stoicism (Hishtavut). After he is worthy of Stoicism, hecan also be worthy of Meditation (Hitbodedut). And after he is worthy of Meditation,he can be worthy of Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit, enlightenment). From there, he canreach the level of Prophecy, where he can actually predict the future.In explaining the mystery of Stoicism, Rabbi Abner related the following account:77A sage once came to one of the Meditators (Mitbodedim) and asked that he beaccepted into their society.The other replied, “My son, blessed are you to God. You intentions are good. Buttell me, have you attained stoicism or not?”The sage said, “Master, explain your words.”The Meditator said, “If one man is praising you and another is insulting you, are thetwo equal in your eyes or not?”He replied, “No my master. I have pleasure from those who praise me, and painfrom those who degrade me. But I do not take revenge or bear a grudge.”"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The other said, “Go in peace my son. You have not attained stoicism. You have notreached a level where your soul does not feel the praise of one who honors you, nor thedegradation of one who insults you.

Go and increase thehumbleness of your heart, and learn to treat everything equally until you have becomestoic. Only then will you be able to meditate.Light of the Eyes.78One who is worthy to reach the level of meditation (hitbodedut) has peace in thislife. To reach this level, one must bind himself to three traits, and keep himself fromtheir opposite. He will then have peace in this world, and certainly in the next.These are the three traits: One must rejoice in his portion, he must love meditation,and he must flee from position and honor. This involves the subjugation of the heart.79Rabbi Isaac of Acco writes in the name of Rabbi Moshe, a disciple of Rabbi JosephGikatalia:If a person's heart impels him to rectify his traits, perfecting his personality anddeeds, he should pursue humility to the ultimate degree. He should “be insulted but notinsult, hear himself scorned but not respond.”80 The Divine Presence will thenimmediately rest on him and he will not have to learn from any mortal being, for thespirit of God will teach him.81Elsewhere, [Rabbi Isaac of Acco] writes:We found this in the books of the Kabbalists who were worthy of the way of truth:One of the great rectifications for one who wishes to know God is that he should beamong those who are “insulted but does not insult.” This should even be true withregard to people of whom he is not afraid and before whom he has no shame, such ashis wife and children. Even if members of his household insult him, he should notanswer, except to correct their ways. . . . But inwardly, he should feel no anger, but hisheart should always be joyful, attached [to God] no matter what happens.82PARALLELSIt is related that one of the Hasidim asked one of his companions, “Have youattained stoicism (hishtavut)?” When the other asked the meaning of his question, heexplained, “Have you [reached a level where] praise and insult are equal in your eyes?”The other replied negatively, and he said, “If this is true/then you have not reached the[necessary level].

It is the highest level of piety and its desired end.Rabbi Bachya ibn Pekudah (1050-1120).83"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"[My angelic master taught me this:] Do not worry about anything in the world, otherthan that which will influence your worship of God. With regard to all worldly things,everything should be the same as its opposite.This is the mystery of the words of the sage, who asked an initiate who wished toinvolve himself in Unifications (Yichudim), “Have you attained stoicism?”If a person does not see that all good in the physical world is exactly the same as itsevil, it is impossible for him to Unify all things.Rabbi Joseph Caw (1488-1575).84“I have been stoic, God is before me at all times.” (Psalms 16:8). This denotes alevel of stoicism with regard to all that befalls a person. Whether people insult him orpraise him, it should all be equal. The same is true of eating, whether he eatssweetmeats or gall, it should all be equal to him. In this manner, one can dispel theEvil Urge (Yetzer HaRa) completely.Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov (1698-1760).85It is told that one of the Hasidim was once asked, “What was the happiest occasionin your life?” He told the following story:I was once travelling on a ship along with merchants carrying costly goods. I wishedto meditate (hitboded) on my Creator, and I went down into the bowels of the ship,lying there in the lowest place. The young son of one of the merchants stood himselfover me, insulting me and spitting in my face. He then uncovered himself and urinatedon me. I was astounded at his brazenness.But as God lives, my soul was not downcast as a result of this. After he left, I wasexceedingly happy, realizing that my soul had reached a level of true humility. Irealize that through this trait, one can “walk, among the Ones who stand.”86 This traitdominated me so much that I felt absolutely nothing whatsoever.Rabbi Eliahu di Vidas (16th Century).874. PUBLICATION OF THE ZOHARIn the 1270's, a number of manuscripts began to circulate among the Kabbalists,creating a tremendous stir. Rumors began to fly that an ancient text had beendiscovered, stemming from the famed Second Century mystic, Rabbi Shimon barYochai. This remarkable manuscript was being published by an important Kabbalist ofthat time, Rabbi Moshe de Leon (1238–1305). By 1281, a number of mystical textswere already quoting passages from this text, which soon became known as theZohar.88Even though the manuscripts included some two dozen texts, they were consideredto be a single body of literature. Stories began to be told how these manuscripts hadbeen hidden in a vault for a thousand years and had been dug up by an Arabian king"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"and sent to Toledo.89 Others said that the Ramban (Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, 1194–1270) had sent them by ship to his son, but the ship had been diverted and they endedup in the hands of Rabbi Moshe de Leon. There were also some whispers that RabbiMoshe himself had written these books, using mystical powers derived from the“Name of Writing.”The Zohar itself provides a clue, stating that it should be revealed in preparation forthe final redemption, twelve hundred years after the destruction of the secondTemple.90 Since the Temple was destroyed in the year 69, this would mean that theZohar was meant to be revealed in 1269. The secret society, who were guardians ofthese mysteries, entrusted this task to Rabbi Moshe de Leon, who was possibly amember of this group.Seeing parts of the text and hearing conflicting rumors surrounding it, Rabbi Isaacof Acco decided to investigate the matter. He met with Rabbi Moshe de Leon, and thelatter swore that the manuscript was an authentic text from Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.It is difficult to imagine that a saint such as Rabbi Moshe would violate the ThirdCommandment and swear falsely regarding this, no matter what his motive. Excited,Rabbi Isaac asked him to see the original manuscript, a request to which Rabbi Moshereadily agreed. Again, it would hardly seem likely that one would be so ready todisplay a manuscript that did not exist, or even one that had been forged.Before Rabbi Isaac was able to view the manuscript, however, Rabbi Moshe haddied. Upon inquiring as to the manuscripts, he was informed by David of Pancorbo thatRabbi Moshe's widow had claimed that the manuscript had never existed, and that theentire text had been made up. Stunned, Rabbi Isaac decided to explore the matterfurther.In his search, he is informed by a prominent Kabbalist, Rabbi Joseph HaLevi, that hehad once tested Rabbi Moshe regarding the Zohar. Claiming to have lost a manuscript,he had Rabbi Moshe write him a new one, and found to be precisely identical to thefirst. This was a clear indication that the writer had a manuscript from which he hadmade copies. Encouraged, Rabbi Isaac of Acco is determined to investigate until hecomes to a final conclusion.The entire account is in Rabbi Isaac's Divrey HaYamim (Chronicles), and nomanuscripts of this text have survived. The pertinent selection, however, was publishedby Rabbi Abraham Zacuto (1448–1515) in his Sefer HaYuchasin (Book ofGeneologies), but it was deleted from all editions of this book other than the firstedition, which was published by the author in 1510 in Constantinople.91 Unfortunately,the published account ends abruptly, probably because the author did not have thesucceeding pages, and therefore, we are not told of Rabbi Isaac of Acco's conclusion.Besides this, however, a number of other points are also left hanging. For example,if Rabbi Moshe did indeed write a copy for himself, what happened to it? Why did no"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"one recall ever having seen it?It seems obvious that none of Rabbi Moshe's contemporaries considered him to havebeen capable of authoring the Zohar. Whoever claimed that he himself had written itsaid that he did so through the “Name of Writing,” which would enable a person towrite in a manner far beyond his natural capabilities. Furthermore, anyone familiarwith Rabbi Moshe's writings, which are extensive, immediately sees that his entiresystem is very different from that of the Zohar.92David of Pancorbo's story can be explained in many ways. First of all, it was toldthird hand, from Rabbi Moshe's wife to that of a certain Joseph, then to Joseph himself,and finally to David, who in turn related it to Rabbi Isaac. This leaves much room forerror. And how reliable was the widow? Parchment was quite expensive in those days,and as a result of her intense poverty, she might have sold the manuscripts as a scrapparchment, to be erased and reused, as was common in that period. When later askedabout the manuscripts, she may have been ashamed to have disposed of a valuablevolume in such a manner, and simply made up a story denying that the manuscriptshad ever existed, a perfectly natural response.Another possibility is that either David or Joseph were ashamed to admit that theyhad tried to swindle these priceless documents from Rabbi Moshe's widow. They mighthave actually obtained them, but would not want an outsider to know that they haddone so without informing the widow of their true value. Under Jewish law, this wouldhave been a most reprehensible act, and she could even have sued to recover themanuscripts. one's suspicions are further raised, since David speaks very unkindly ofRabbi Moshe, while among his contemporaries in general, he seems to have enjoyed areputation as a sage and saint.But what was Rabbi Isaac of Acco's own conclusion? This is the most importantquestion. It is critical to any discussion of the Zohar, and has not been sufficientlyexplored. Looking at his own words, we find that he writes in his Otzar Chaim: “RabbiShimon bar Yochai clearly realized that the supernal spiritual Forces are very jealousof those who engage in the Workings of Creation, which is natural wisdom, and in theWorkings of the Merkava, which is divine wisdom. Together with his son RabbiEliezer and the ten sages who were with them in the cave (!) he therefore wrote theZohar in Aramaic rather than in Hebrew [since these forces do not understandAramaic].93Quoting the Zohar in another place, Rabbi Isaac likewise writes, “These are thewords of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and it is forbidden to depart from them. They arethe living words of God . . . sweeter than honey. For authority was given to him fromon high, such as had never been given to any other sage. Compared to the other sages,he is like Moses compared to the other prophets.”94In a number of other places, he likewise cites the Zohar as the work of Rabbi"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Shimon.95 The fact that he quotes the Zohar would in itself not be proof that heaccepted it as an authentic ancient text. But he would hardly attribute it to RabbiShimon bar Yochai so openly if he did not consider it authentic.A most important point is that the Otzar Chaim was written after Rabbi Isaac hadinvestigated the origin of the Zohar. We recall that the entire account of thisinvestigation is quoted from his Divrey HaYamim. This was clearly written before hisOtzar Chaim, since in a number of places in the later book, he actually mentions hisDivrey HaYamim.96We therefore come to a highly significant conclusion. The one person best in theposition to investigate the authenticity of the Zohar, after a thorough investigation,openly states that it was written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. This fact has escaped thenotice of historians, and may be highly instrumental in dispelling their doubts as to theauthenticity of the Zohar.An excerpt fromSefer HaYuchasinIn the month of Adar, Rabbi Isaac writes that Acco was destroyed in the year 5050(1291), and the saints of Israel were killed in the most brutal manner. Rabbi Isaacsurvived, and by 5065 (1305), had been in Navarra in the province of Asti, Italy. In theyear 5065 (1305), he came to Toledo.The following account is found in his Divrey HaYamim. He also wrote a Kabbalahtext in the year of the Angel (HaMalach, = 96), [that is, in the year 5096(1336)].97 It was in his time that Acco was destroyed, and many were taken intocapitvity, including the Ramban's grandson, and the grandson of Rabbi David, son ofRabbi Abraham, son of Maimonides.He later went to Spain to investigate how the Zohar was found in his time. This hadbeen written by Rabbi Shimon and his son Eliezer in the cave. Happy are those who areworthy of its truth, for in its light they see light.98He vouched for its authenticity, although some similar manuscripts had been forged.He said that he knew from tradition that everything written in Aramaic was actuallyfrom Rabbi Shimon. That which is in Hebrew, however, was a later addition, since theoriginal book was written completely in Aramaic.99These are his words:When I saw the Zohar, I realized that its words are wondrous, drawn from a highplace, from the Fount that gives without receiving, blessed be the Name of the glory ofHis Kingdom forever and ever. I pursued it, and asked scholars who have large sectionsof the text about it. These were wondrous words, known by Kabbalah-tradition that hadbeen transmitted orally, but they were never permitted to be written down in a book,where they are clearly available to all who can read."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"I inquired as to their source, but the answers that I received did not all agree. Somesaid one thing, but others had a completely different story.Some said that the faithful Ramban had sent it from the Holy Land to his son inCatalonia, but that the wind had brought the ship to the land of Aragonia. Others saidthat it had come to Alicante. Eventually, it came to the hands of the sage, Rabbi Moshede Leon, who is also called Rabbi Moshe of Guadalhajara.Others claimed that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai never actually wrote the book, butthat Rabbi Moshe knew the Name of Writing, and through its power, had written thesewondrous things. In order to fetch a high price and obtain much money for themanuscripts, he had “hung his words on great trees.”100 He therefore said that he hadtranscribed it from a book written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, his son Rabbi Eliezer,and their school.When I came to Spain, I arrived in the city of Valladolid, where the king had hiscapitol. It was there that I met Rabbi Moshe, and we became friendly and discussed[the Zohar]. He made a solomn oath and swore to me, “May God strike me down, andmay He continue to do so if [the Zohar] is not an ancient book written by RabbiShimon bar Yochai. At this very moment, the manuscript is in my house, in Avila,were I live. Come and visit me there, and I will show it to you.”Soon after this, we separated, and Rabbi Moshe left for Arevalo, on the way home toAvila. He became sick in Arevalo, and died there.When I heard this news, I was deathly upset, but I decided to visit Avila. When Iarrived there, I found an elderly sage whose name is Rabbi David of Pancorbo. I foundgrace in his eyes, and bound him by an oath, saying, “Resolve for me the mystery ofthe Zohar. Some say one thing and others say the opposite. Rabbi Moshe himselfvowed [that the Zohar was authentic], but died before he could verify it to me. I do notknow who is reliable and whose word to believe.”He replied, “The truth is this: I have determined without question that this bookcalled the Zohar never existed, and never came to the hand of Rabbi Moshe. But he wasa master of the Name of Writing, and through the power of that name, wroteeverything in that book. Listen and I will tell you how I determined this.“Rabbi Moshe was a great spendthrift, tossing away money very generously. Todayhis house could have been filled with silver and gold, given to him by the rich whounderstand the great mysteries that he gave them, written through the Name ofWriting. But tomorrow it would be completely empty.“His wife and daughter are presently virtually naked, hungry and thirsty, and totallydestitute.“When I heard that he had died in Arevelo, I went to the wealthiest man in the city,whose name is Joseph de Avila, and I said to him, ‘The time has finally arrived whenyou can obtain the priceless [original] manuscript of the Zohar. Just listen to my"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"advice.’“I advised Joseph to instruct his wife, ‘Send a generous gift to Rabbi Moshe's widowwith you maid.' She did this, and on the next day, he told her to go to the house ofRabbi Moshe's widow and say, I would like my son to marry your daughter. If youagree, for the rest of your life, you will never lack food or clothing. I want nothingfrom you other than the manuscript of the Zohar, from which your husband transcribedthe copies that he distributed.’“[Joseph] told his wife, ‘Speak to the mother and daughter separately and tell themthis. Listen carefully to their answer, and see whether or not the two say the samething.’“Rabbi Moshe's widow swore to Joseph's wife, and said, ‘May God strike me down[if I lie to you], but my husband never owned such a book. Everything that he wrotewas made up, from his own mind.’“She related that she would often see him writing without any other book in front ofhim, and she would ask him, ‘Why do you tell people that you are transcribing thisfrom a book? You do not have a book, but are making it all up out of your head.Wouldn't it be better if you say that you are the author if this book, and that it is theproduct of your intellect? Would you not have more honor?’“He would answer, ‘If I would reveal my secret, that I am making this up from myown mind, they would not pay any attention to what I write. They would not give me apenny for my writings, since they would consider them nothing more than the productof my imagination. But now, when they hear that it is taken from the Zohar, written byRabbi Shimon bar Yochai, with Ruach HaKodesh, and that I am only transcribing it,they pay a high price for it. You can see this yourself.’“After this, Joseph's wife spoke to Rabbi Moshe's daughter, saying the same thingsthat she had said to her mother. She proposed that the daughter marry her son, and thatthe mother would be provided with food and clothing. She answered exactly the sameas her mother, adding nothing and subtracting nothing.“Do you need any clearer evidence than this?”After hearing this, I was confused and dismayed. At the time, 1 was certain thatthere had never been any original manuscript. All that existed was that he hadcomposed using the Name of Writing and had distributed to people.I then left Avila and travelled to Talavera. There I found an extraordinary sage, witha generous heart and a good eye, by the name of Rabbi Joseph HaLevi, son of the greatKabbalist, Rabbi Todros.101 I asked him about the Zohar.He replied, “You must know and believe that the manuscript of the Zohar whichRabbi Moses had was written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. It was this manuscript thathe transcribed, giving copies to those whom he deemed worthy. I myself tested RabbiMoshe to see if he was actually copying from an ancient text, or he was merely"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"inventing it through the power of the Name of Writing.“This was the test: He had written for me many large volumes of the Zohar. Manydays after he had written them, I hid one of the folios and told him that I had lost it,pressing him to write me another copy. He said, ‘If you show me the end of the foliobefore it and the beginning of the next folio, I will be able to provide you with an exactcopy.’“I did this, and after several days, he brought me a copy of the missing folio. Icompared it with the original copy, and there was absolutely no difference betweenthem. Nothing had been added or left out, and there was no change in wording. Bothwording and content was exactly the same, just as if it had been copied from myoriginal.“Can there be a better test than this?”I then left Talavera and came to Toledo, where I continued to investigate the book,inquiring among the sages and their disciples. There I also found that the subject wascontroversial, where opposite opinions were being expressed.I told them about Rabbi Joseph's test, but they replied that it was by no meansconclusive. It was quite possible that [Rabbi Moshe] had used the Name of Writing tomake a copy for himself, and then transcribe from his own copy. He would thereforehave a primary text, and it would be just as if he were copying it from an ancientmanuscript.But then I discovered something new there. The disciples told me that they had seenan old man, whose name was Jacob, who had been a foremost disciple of Rabbi Moshe,and who had been loved by him like a son. [I spoke to him, and] he called heaven andearth as his witnesses that the Zohar that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai wrote (The textends abruptly at this point).5. OCCULT SCHOOLSThe line between meditation and magic is often a tenuous one, and in many areas ofKabbalah the distinction is difficult to discern. How, for example, do we describe aprocess where a magical incantation is repeated over and over, and for all practicalpurposes, is used as a mantra? Do we ascribe the effect to the supernatural powers ofthe Name or incantation, or to the meditative state that it induces? This question hasnever been fully resolved in the Kabbalah, and hence, the magical and meditativeschools often appear to overlap.The controversy regarding this type of magical Kabbalah was quite strong in the1200's. Maimonides (1135–1204) was aware of these magical practices, and hedenounces them in no uncertain terms, deeming them fit only for the ignorant andunlearned.102 Abulafia follows this philosophical ideal, describing these cryptic ritesin detail and denouncing their practitioners as charlatans of the lowest kind.103 Isaac of"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Acco, on the other hand, not only appears to have approved of such practices, but heactually seemed to have used them.104This controversy seemed to have lasted well into the Sixteenth Century. The Aritried to abolish these practices completely, and in general, strongly denounced the useof the Practical Kabbalah (Kabbalah Maasiut), as it was called. On the other hand, hischief disciple, Rabbi Chaim Vital, was not only familiar with these practices, but alsoappeared to have made use of them.105 Another important Kabbalist of that period,Rabbi Joseph Tzayach, describes a number of magical rites, but warns the reader tokeep his motives absolutely pure when using them.106 There is no question that theserites were widely known and used during that period.One of the foremost practitioners of the Practical Kabbalah was Rabbi Joseph DellaReina (1418–1472), who lived in the Holy Land. Many magical formulas are preservedin his name, and it is obvious that he was considered to be one of the greatest mastersof these occult arts.107 Tradition teaches that he made use of his powers in an attemptto bring the final redemption, but was unsuccessful and spiritually injured in theprocess. According to some accounts, he became an apostate, according to others hewent mad, while others say that he committed suicide. In many texts, his example iscited as a warning against practicing these methods.108Many techniques of the magical schools of Kabbalah involved incantations andamulets, and these were often used for trivial and even questionable purposes. Someare for practical things, such as protection while travelling, quieting a stormy sea, oraiding a woman having a difficult childbirth. Others are for “opening the heart” andsimilar enlightenment. We also find formulas for protection against one's enemies, oreven some for doing away with them.Some of these methods, however, were used for objectives as trivial as catchingfish.109 Others were for questionable goals, such as for luck in gambling.110 We findformulas for love, some which even involve physical contact with the desiredwoman.111 Some practices include the use of “grasses,” which were possiblypsychedelic drugs.112 In general, it is not difficult to understand why these practiceswere widely condemned or at least discouraged by Kabbalists involved in seriousmeditation and philosophical analysis.Still, the traditions of the Magical or Practical Kabbalah were very ancient, andalthough often perverted, still contained methods through which one could attain highmeditative states. Such texts as Charba DeMoshe (The Sword of Moses), SeferHaCasdim (Book of the Chaldees), Sefer HaRazim (Book of Secrets), and SeferHaMalbush (Book of the Garment), had been around for many centuries, possibly evenfrom the Talmudic period.113There are many texts involving the Practical Kabbalah from the Sixteenth Centuryand earlier, but most of these consist of little more than fragments. In many cases, a"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"“book” is nothing more than a number of single, unrelated, incomplete pages, boundtogether in a single volume. For the most part, our knowledge of the practicalKabbalah comes from these fragments. A few small booklets involving these methodshave been published, the most notable being Toledot Adam (Generations of Adam)attributed to Rabbi Eliahu Baal Shem Tov (1537-1653).114One of the most complete collections of such practices is found in a remarkablemanuscript, Shoshan Yesod Olam (The Rose, Foundation of the Universe), compiledaround 1550 by a certain Rabbi Joseph Tirshom.115 This book contains over twothousand magical formulas from the Practical Kabbalah. From a number of remarks bythe redactor, it appears that the text was compiled from many ancient manuscripts thathe had in his hand.116 Although many of these practices are purely magical, manyothers combine elements of both magic and meditation, and can therefore be includedin the latter category.One interesting practice frequently encountered in this genre of literature involvesinduced dreams. This is usually referred to as a “Dream Request” (Shaalat Chalom),where one poses a question and attempts to induce an answer to appear in a dream. Thepractice itself is very ancient, alluded to even in the Talmud, and examples are foundfrom as early as the Tenth Century.117 While the methods for inducing dreams areoften purely magical, there are some that have important meditative overtones. This isparticularly significant because of the general relationship between prophecy,enlightenment and dreams.6. MAGIC SQUARESOne of the most mysterious Kabbalists of the Sixteenth Century was Rabbi JosephTzayach (1505–1573), who was also one of the leading rabbinical figures of thatperiod. Aside from his many mystical works, a large body of Responsa exist from himin manuscript, and he is known to have corresponded with the leading religious leadersof that time.118 The great codist, Rabbi Joseph Caro quotes a number of his responsa inhis Avkat Rokhel.119Rabbi Joseph Tzayach was apparently born in Jerusalem, and from there he waschosen to serve as rabbi in Damascus. There were two Jewish communities inDamascus, one being an immigrant community from Spain, consisting of some fivehundred families, and the other being the native communities, known as theMostarabians, who had been there from ancient times. It was the Mostarabiancommunity that chose Tzayach as its leader, but it also seems that he learned manyancient mysteries from them.Tzayach commuted frequently between Damascus and Jerusalem, and we find himin the Holy City on numerous occasions between 1538 and 1555. It was in Jerusalemthat he wrote his main Kabbalistic work, Evven HaShoham (The Onyx Stone) in 1538."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"A year later, he wrote a second book, Tzeror HaChaim (The Binding of Life), amystical commentary on the Talmud.120 His Sheirit Yosef (Remnant of Joseph) anexpansion of Evven HaShoham, was written in 1549, also in Jerusalem.121 Besidesthese, he also mentions another book, Tzafanat Paneach, which is no longer extant.122At least three of his books are dedicated to Abraham Castro, who apparentlysupported Tzayach, while he was in Jerusalem. This Abraham Castro was a leader ofthe Jewish community in Egypt, and was famed as a philanthropist, distributing morethan three thousand gold florens each year. The Turkish Sultan, Selim I (1467–1520),had conquered Egypt in the battle of Aleppo in 1517. Soon after this, he appointedAbraham Castro, a Jew of Spanish descent, as Master of the Mint, responsible forissuing the new Turkish coinage in Egypt.Besides his high government position, Castro was also an important leader in theJewish community. It was he who secured the appointment of the Radbaz (Rabbi Davidabu Zimra, 1480–1574), one of the most prominent religious authorities of that period,as chief rabbi of Cairo. From his dedications, it is apparent that he was also a patron ofRabbi Tzayach. As we shall see, the fact that Tzayach corresponded with the Radbaz isalso highly significant.123Rabbi Joseph Tzayach apparently was influenced by Abulafia's school, and manyideas that he discusses seem to be taken verbatum from Abulafia's writings. Thus, forexample, Abulafia warns that one striving for the highest level, which is called theCrown, or Keter (), must be careful, lest he be “cut off” (Karet, ). He notes thatboth words contain the same letters, and the exact same idea is also mentioned anumber of times in Tzayach's works.124Even more obvious is an interpretation of the Hebrew word for “letters,” which isOtiot (). The word can be divided into two, spelling out Tav Alef (), “a line ofAlef,” and Tav Yod (), “a line of Yod ( = 10).” This is said to be indicative of astrong relationship between the letters of the alphabet and the ten digits, which are tenunits. A virtually identical discussion of this is found both in Abulafia's Or HaSekheland in Tzayach's Tzeror HaChaim.125One book that Tzayach mentions numerous times is the Bahir.126 It also appears thathe was familiar with Shoshan Yesod Olam or one of its precursers. In one place, hespeaks of a book called Yesod Olam, which quotes a certain Aramas, a disciple ofChalatino the Magician.127 While there is apparently no reference to this magician inShoshan Yesod Ohm, it may be on one of the many missing pages in the manuscript. Itis also possible that Shoshan Yesod Olam was an expansion or supplement of an earlierbook called Yesod Olam, and this would help explain its name.Particularly noteworthy is the fact that Tzayach does not mention the Zohar. Indeed,in his discussions of chiromancy, he does not follow the Zohar's system, but uses analternative method, still used by western occultists.128 When one takes into account"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"that in his Sulam HaAliyah, Rabbi Judah Albotini also fails to mention the Zohar, thisbecomes highly significant. The Zohar was the main text of the theoretical Kabbalists,but it appears that the meditative Kabbalists followed a completely different traditionthat did not include the Zohar. One reason for this may have been the fact that, at leastoutwardly, the Zohar makes virtually no reference to meditation.Tzayach's most important work is his Evven HaShoham, literally “the Onyx Stone.”As he mentions in his introduction, the onyx paralleled the tribe of Joseph in Aaron'sbreastplate, and the title therefore alludes to the name of the author.129 He also notesthat the word Shoham () has the same letters as HaShem (), meaning “the Name,”since this is the main point of the book.This text, as well as Sheirit Yosef, was explicitly written as a meditative text, as theauthor clearly states in his introduction. The books contain what appears to be anextremely complex meditative system, but the author purposely conceals the key to itsuse. Many ideas mentioned in this book appear to be unique in Kabbalah, and it maywell represent a tradition that has otherwise been lost.130 There is much numericalmanipulation (gematria) in the book, as well as a numerology that is moresophisticated than anything else that I have seen in any Kabbalistic text.Also found here is considerable insight into common human behavior. Aninteresting example is his discussion of how the five fingers parallel the five senses,and the manner in which the two are unconsciously associated. The pinky is associatedwith hearing, and one therefore cleans one's ear with the pinky. The ring fingerparallels the sense of sight, and one often uses it to wipe the eye, while the middlefinger is used for touch. The forefinger is related to smell, and is used to clean thenose. Finally, the thumb is associated with the sense of taste, and it is for this reasonthat small children often suck their thumbs.131This would seem like nothing more than a humorous insight, but the author thenassociates these five concepts with the five divisions of the Hebrew alphabetmentioned in the Sefer Yetzirah.132 He then goes on to associate them with the fivemethods of manipulating letters through Tzeruf. He concludes by saying, “I havealready discussed this, but it is not permissible to put in in writing.”Even more interesting, and to my knowledge unique, is his association of the TenSefirot with the lines of the fingers, as indicated in the figure on the opposite page.These account for the upper nine Sefirot, and the triplet array parallels that ofconventional Kabbalah. The lowest Sefirah, which is Malkhut-Kingship, is representedby what is called the Heart Line in conventional chiromancy, or perhaps by the Girdleof Venus. Tzayach concludes, “The line on the palm that begins under the middlefinger and extends to the pinky indicates the Coronet (Malkhut). This goes ‘to the eastof Ashur’ (Genesis 2:14), encompassing the Ten Holy [Sefirot]. Surrounding them arethe Ten Unclean Ones. All of this is alluded to in the lines of the palm, and is"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"understood by those who know these mysteries.”133Tzayach's System of ChiromancyTzayach is very reticent when it comes to discussing how this system can be used,and in his introduction openly states that he is obscuring such things.134 One gets avery strong impression, however, that he advocates contemplating these lines in ameditative sense. One can gaze at his palm until these lines begin to glow, and theyactually begin to resemble the Sefirot. The initiate sits, gazing at his own hand, andusing the finger lines as steps, he can climb the ladder of the Sefirot until he reachesthe highest Crown.135"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Even more fascinating is Tzayach's discussion of magic squares. These numericalarrays were well-known in ancient India and China, and were introduced to the westernworld in the early 1400's by Moschopulus of Constantinople. It appears that they werealso known to the ancient Kabbalists. They are discussed in a number of places inKabbalistic literature, and when engraved on metal or stone, are often used in amulets.Tzayach himself discusses such uses, and many references can be found in ShoshanYesod Olam and in Toledot Adam.136 In his Sh'nei Luchot HaB'rit (Two Tablets of theCovenant), Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz (1560–1630), a major figure in Kabbalah, discussesa magic square in relation to the mysteries of creation.137The most elementary magic square is of the third order, that is, it contains threedigits to a side. It therefore contains the first nine digits, and its usual form isThe reader will immediately notice that every line, row and diagonal has the samesum, namely fifteen. Furthermore, the sum of any two extremities in a straight line isalways ten.138 This is the simplest magic square, since one of the first order is a simpledigit, and it is impossible to construct one of the second order.Tzayach discusses the relationship between magic squares and the planets, and hissystem is very similar to that of ancient astrology and alchemy.139 This is certainly nocoincidence, since both lay claim to a very ancient tradition.In Tzayach's system, however, we do not stop with the planets, but continue andproceed to the Sefirot. These are represented by magic squares of the order ten totwenty.140 These magic squares are apparently used for a very special meditation,where each horizontal row is a “house,” while each number in this row is a “room.”Thus, in the magic square of the tenth order, which represents Keter-Crown, the first“room” of the first “house” is 1, the second room is 2, the third is 98, and the fourth is97."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"In the meditative system, each number represents a “thousand myriad” (10,000,000)parsangs, and a “thousand myriad” colored lights. As one mentally travels from roomto room and from house to house, going through the magic square of Keter-Crown, onemust apparently attempt to depict these lights. These exercises thus allow one toelevate himself through the Sefirot in a very graphic manner.The magic square for Keter-Crown is presented in three places in his works.141 Hewarns against trying to change or improve the squares, as some tried to do. He writesthat he “received this from my master, of blessed memory. One should not add to thesquares that we have drawn, since they allude to the highest and most concealedconcepts, as we have explained. One who attempts to improve them, actuallydiminishes them, for he does not consider the glory of God. . . . Each house and eachroom has a specific function, but this I did not learn from my master.”142"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"In a number of places, Tzayach stops just short of explicitly explaining exactly howthese squares are to be used. In one place he states, “If you look carefully at the orderof numbers in the houses and rooms, you will understand a wondrous conceptregarding the mystery of the order of Atzilut. But I do not have the authority to explainthe mystery of these luminaries, or to write down with my pen why there are more insome rooms and less in others.”143Elsewhere, he repeats that he does not have the authority to reveal the reasons forthe numbers associated with each room. He concludes, “This is among the deepestmysteries of the highest Merkava. It cannot be deliniated by books or scrolls. Themysterious reason for this is that they are cycled by the Infinite Being (Ain Sof), whereno eye can penetrate. May He and His name be blessed. But from what I have written,the intelligent will understand.”144There is considerable discussion as to whether one should meditate alone, ortogether with an instructor. The Baal Shem Tov explicitly taught that one shouldalways meditate with a companion, since this can otherwise be very dangerous.145Tzayach anticipates this, and writes, “It is necessary for the initiate's master to standover him the first time, until he becomes accustomed [to enter these states. His master]can help bring him back to his normal state of consciousness. . . . [One must do this]until he is properly initiated into these new states [of consciousness], lest he gaze andlose his mind [like Ben Zoma]”.146"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Finally, Tzayach was probably the last Kabbalist to advocate the use of the propheticposition, where one places his head between his knees. This position was used byElijah on Mount Carmel, and occasionally, by the sages of the Talmud. It is alsomentioned by Hai Gaon (939–1038), head of the Babylonian academy at Pumbedita.147Some five hundred years later, Tzayach discusses the same position. Speaking ofindividuals who meditate (hitboded), he says, “They bend themselves like reeds,placing their heads between their knees until all their faculties are nullified. As a resultof this lack of sensation, they see the Supernal Light, with true vision and not withallegory.”148This position is also associated with meditation on the houses and rooms in themagic squares. He writes, “If you wish to enter into their mystery, concentrate on allthat we have said. Contemplate (hitbonen) the rooms that we have discussed, togetherwith their lights, colors, and letter combinations. Meditate (hitboded) on this for awhile, either briefly or at length. Begin by placing your head between your knees.”149He then includes a remarkable prayer that should be said while in the propheticposition:Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh, Crown me (Keter).Yah, grant me Wisdom (Chokhmah).Elohim Chaim, grant me Understanding (Binah).El, with the right hand of His Love, make me great (Chesed).Elohim, from the Terror of His Judgment, protect me (Gevurah).YHVH, with His mercy, grant me Beauty (Tiferet).Adonoy Tzevaot, watch me Forever (Netzach).Elohim Tzevaot, grant me beatitude from His Splendor (Hod).El Chai, make his covenant my Foundation (Yesod).Adonoy, open my lips and my mouth will speak of Your praise (Malkhut).The reader will immediately notice that this chant includes the Ten Sefirot, as wellas the Divine Names associated with them. This is the only place where we find anactual meditative practice involving the prophetic position. The chant involving theSefirot is also unique.The fact that Tzayach mentions such an early method strongly suggests that he washeir to a very ancient tradition, possibly one coming from Hai Gaon. Tzayach lived inDamascus, a city that had a continuous Jewish community dating back to Biblicaltimes. It is very possible that these very ancient traditions had been preserved withinthis community."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVESafed1. THE RAMAKOne of the greatest of all theoretical Kabbalists, and one of the main systematisersof its philosophy, was Rabbi Moshe Cordevero (1522–1570) of Safed. So respectedwas he that he was the first Kabbalist honored by being called by his initials, and eventoday, initiates call him “the Ramak.” Until his time, only the greatest Talmudicmasters had been given this distinction, having the word “the” added before theirinitials to indicate that they were a solid part of the tradition. Thus for example, RabbiMoshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) became known as “the Rambam,” Rabbi Moshe benNachman (Nachmanides) became “the Ramban,” and Rabbi Sh'lomo ben Adret became“the Rashba.”The Ramak was born in Safed, a city that was to become famed as a center of theKabbalah. At a very tender age, he gained a reputation as a most extraordinary genius.Besides his knowledge in Kabbalah, he was a Talmudic scholar and philosopher of thehighest rank, and was widely respected in these fields. But his main interest was thesystematisation of the Kabbalah, setting it into a philosophical structure, a task thathad already been started by Rabbi Judah Chayit (1462–1529) and Rabbi Meir Gabbai(1480–1547).The Zohar had been accepted as the foundation of Kabbalah, but for the most part,its system appeared as complex and unstructured as that of the Bible and Talmud. Ittook a genius of the stature of Maimonides to unravel and systematise thephilosophical system of the Bible and Talmud, clearly outlining the organizingprinciples underlying its structure. What the Rambam had done for the moreconventional tradition, the Ramak was to do for the Kabbalah.Like Maimonides, the Ramak defended his system against its detractors, and in mostcases his words were directed against those philosophers who refused to accept theauthority of the Kabbalah. In one place, he states that the philosophers can onlysurmise what exists in the metaphysical realm, while the Kabbalist can actually see it.1But besides being the pre-eminent philosopher of the Kabbalistic world, the Ramakwas also thoroughly familiar with its mystical elements. He was an expert in thevarious systems of meditative and practical Kabbalah, and although he rarely speaksabout these areas, there is enough in his writings to indicate an intimate familiarity.Thus, in one place he quote a long section from Abulafia's Or HaSekhel.2 Elsewhere,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"he actually mentions the book and its author by name, saying that this is the mostimportant system involving the pronunciation of the Divine Name.3No mere theorist, the Ramak was also actively engaged in Kabbalah meditation,through a method known as Gerushin or “Divorce.” We know very little of thismethod, even though an entire booklet, called Sefer Gerushin (Book of Divorce) waswritten regarding the insight that the Ramak gained through this method.4 Mostprobably it consisted of meditating on a given scripture, or perhaps repeating it overand over like a mantra until one could relate to it on a high meditative state. One wouldthen gain deep insight into it, without having to analyze it logically.The word “Divorce” in this context, most probably meant divorce from the physical,even though it also obviously had the connotation of separation and seclusion frominhabited places. In this respect, it is very much like the word Hitbodedut, which refersto both physical and mental seclusion.The Ramak founded a Kabbalah academy in Safed, and until the rise of the Ari, wasconsidered the dean of the Safed school. Among his disciples were many of theluminaries of Safed, including Rabbi Eliahu di Vidas, author of Reshit Chokhmah(Beginning of Wisdom), and Rabbi Chaim Vital, who later became the Ari's Boswell.It is reported that the prophet Elijah revealed himself to the Ramak, and when he died,the Ari said that he saw a pillar of fire following his bier.It was largely under the leadership of the Ramak that Safed became the greatestcenter of Kabbalah that the world has ever known — a city whose very name issynonymous with the Kabbalah. But there were also other factors that contributed tothis, and it seems as if all the forces of Providence had conspired to create this greatcity of saints and scholars. Three events in the late 1400's were to have a mostimportant influence.The first was the discovery of printing. Guttenberg had printed his Bible around1450, and by 1475 the first Hebrew book had been printed. By the 1490's, over ahundred Hebrew titles had been published, putting the tools of scholarship into thehands of almost everyone. Whereas scholars had previously had to make do with alimited number of expensive, and often barely legible manuscripts, they now couldmake use of rapidly growing personal libraries, having all necessary information attheir fingertips. The information explosion led to the need of systematisation, and itwas during these generations that interest grew, and the need was seen to systemize theentire body of Jewish knowledge, including the Kabbalah.It was during this period that the era of Rishonim (early codifiers) came to a close,and that of Acharonim (later codifiers) began. While the Rishonim were considered tobe primary sources, the Acharonim were merely secondary sources, who dealt mainlywith clarifying and writing commentaries on the works of the Rishonim. While theRishonim studied and published manuscripts, the Acharonim studied and published"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"printed books.The second major event was Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492. As aresult of the change in world view, much of earlier philosophy had to be re-examined,and the philosophical schools, which had opposed the Kabbalah, were significantlyweakened. The discoveries of that time expanded man's horizons, and people began toseek similar expansion of their spiritual lives. This led many to explore the mind-expanding systems taught by the Kabbalah.Most explosive, however, was the Spanish Inquisition, culminating with theexpulsion of all Jews from Spain, also in 1492. Spain had been an important center ofJewish learning in general, and Kabbalah in particular, for many centuries, and withthe expulsion, its leaders were forced to find a new center. We shall encounter a fewindividuals who left Spain as youths, most notably Joseph Caro, who was four at thetime, and Jacob Berab, who was eighteen. But most important for the initialdevelopment of Safed were two mature Kabbalists, both named Joseph: Rabbi JosephSaragossi and Rabbi Joseph Taitatzak.Until this time, Safed had been a small Jewish community, not exerting any knowninfluence. In the early 1490's, its spiritual leader, Rabbi Peretz Colobo, had to maintaina small grocery in order to support himself, the community being too small to pay him.All this, however, was changed with the arrival of Rabbi Joseph Saragossi.Born in Saragossa, Spain, the birthplace of Abulafia, Rabbi Joseph fled with hiscorreligionist in 1492. Possibly following Abulafia's path, he settled for a while inSicily. From there, he emigrated to Beirut, and in 1496, described as an “absolutesaint,” we find him moving to Sidon, where he accepted te post of chief rabbi.5 Fromthere, he assumed the role of rabbi in Safed, which he began to build up as a center forKabbalah. One of his first tasks as rabbi was to start an academy, where both theTalmud and Kabbalah were taught.Saragossi was respected by Jew and Moslem alike for his appeasing spirit, and hewas loved and revered like an angel of peace. The author of Sefer Cheredim, a youngercontemporary, writes, “Joseph Saragossi, teacher of the Radbaz, always brought peacebetween man and his neighbors, and between husband and wife, even among thegentiles. He was worthy of seeing the prophet Elijah.”6The Radbaz mentioned here was Rabbi David abu Zimra (1470–1572), who had alsobeen exiled from Spain. Together with his father, he had settled in Safed, and he soonbecame an important disciple of Rabbi Joseph. Although the Radbaz later gained fameas one of the greatest authorities on Jewish Law, he also wrote numerous books onKabbalah. He was aware of Abulafia's writings, and in at least one place mentions hisChayay Olam HaBah.7It is highly significant to note that Rabbi Judah Albotini, author of Sulam Aliyah(Ladder of Ascent) and one of the most important teachers of Abulafia's methods, was"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"still alive at the time. He was rabbi in Jerusalem, and continued to teach until 1519. Itwould appear highly probable that the Radbaz made his acquaintance, and there waspossibly also communication between Albotini and Saragossi. Albotini had also livedon the Iberian Peninsula, in Portugal, and was most probably known to the SpanishKabbalists.The Radbaz emigrated to Egypt in 1514, and three years later, Egypt was overrun bythe Turks. Abraham Castro, who had been appointed master of the mint, elevated theRadbaz to the position of Chief Rabbi of Cairo. The two were undoubtedly very close,and the Radbaz taught Castro the mysteries of the Kabbalah, informing him of theschools in Jerusalem and Safed. Later, in 1538, we find Castro as a patron and discipleof Rabbi Joseph Tzayach, who had succeeded Albotini as the leader of the Jerusalemschool of Kabbalah. It is also known that Tazyach and the Radbaz corresponded witheach other.An important disciple of the Radbaz in Egypt was Rabbi Betzalel Ashkenazi,renowned as the author of the Shitah Mekubetzet, a most important Talmudiccommentary. But beyond this, along with the Radbaz, Rabbi Betzalel was the one whointroduced the Ari into the mysteries of the Kabbalah.The second important Joseph who had been exiled from Spain was Rabbi JosephTaitatzak (1477–1545), who settled in Salonica. Renowned as one of the greatest sagesof his time, he counted among his disciples such luminaries as Rabbi Samuel diModina (the Maharashdam), Isaac Adrabi and Joseph Caro. A younger contemporary,Rabbi Eliahu di Vidas, writes in his Reshit Chokhmah, “I heard that the sage, RabbiJoseph Taitatzak, of blessed memory, did not sleep in a bed for forty years, except onthe Sabbath. It is told that he used to sleep on a box, with his feet hanging down, andthat he would get up at midnight. No one knew about this, and it was only revealed byhis wife after he died.”8One of Taitatzak's most important disciples in Kabbalah was Rabbi ShlomoAlKabatz (1505–1584), a native of Solinica, best known as the author of the Fridaynight hymn, Lecha Dodi. It was he who was destined to initiate the Ramak into themysteries of the Kabbalah.In 1522, the year of the Ramak's birth, another event took place that had a profoundeffect on the Jewish community. This was the pilgrimage of David Reuveni, a crypticalmessianic figure from Kheybar on the Arabian peninsula, who was able to stand upbefore popes and kings. Travelling through Egypt in 1523, Reuveni reports seeking anaudience with Abraham Castro, and it is also possible that he met with the Radbaz.9 Ayear later, Reuveni gained an audience with Pope Clement VII (1478-1534), who wasapparently very impressed with his visitor from Arabia.During Reuveni's travels, he arrived in Portugal, where he was accepted in the courtof King John III. It was there that he met the King's scribe, Shlomo Molcho, (1501–"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"1532), a Marrano who had been baptized under the name of Diogo Pires. Like manyMarranos of that period, he had studied Judaism secretly, and was proficient in Bibleand Talmud. Portugal had been the site of a great Kabbalistic school, producing suchluminaries as Rabbi Judah Chayit and Judah Albotini, and it is quite possible thatMolcho had also come into contact with a remnant of this school that had survived theexpulsion and had gone into hiding. Upon meeting Reuveni in 1525, Molchocircumcised himself and fled to Solinica.What happened next is somewhat vague. In Salonica, Molcho was drawn into thecircle of Rabbi Joseph Taitatzak, and apparently learned much Kabbalah from him. Onthe other hand, Molcho seemed much more adept in the meditative Kabbalah thanTaitatzak, possibly on the basis of mysteries he had learned while still in Portugal. Bymeans of meditative devices that we shall discuss, Molcho was able to communicatewith a Maggid, a kind of angelic spokesman. Apprised of these methods, Taitatzak alsomade use of them, and before long he was also in communication with a Maggid.There are reports that Molcho also travelled to the Holy Land, possiblycommunicating with the Kabbalists of Jerusalem and Safed. He met with PopeClement VII in 1530, and, having gained respect in the Vatican, was adored by theJews of Rome. A dangerous trap in meditation is that it often makes one feel that hehas superhuman powers when these powers are actually nonexistent, and it appears thatMolcho fell into this trap.In 1532, Molcho sought an audience with Charles V (1500–1558), King of Spain andHoly Roman Emperor. As a leader who had engaged in many religious battles, Charleswas unimpressed with this upstart, and had him handed over to the Inquisition. SinceMolcho had been baptized as a Catholic in Portugal, he was tried as a renegade, andburned at the stake for heresy. Years later, Molcho's example was taken as a warningfor those who would venture too far into the mysteries of the meditative Kabbalah.10"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Autograph of Rabbi Shlomo MolchoA few years later, in the mid 1530's, three individuals came to Safed, and these wereto make the city a center of scholarship and mysticism. The first was the thirty-year-old Shlomo AlKabatz of Solinica, a disciple of Rabbi Joseph Taitatzak, who hadalready earned a reputation as a brilliant Kabbalist. The young Moshe Cordevero, whohad recently celebrated his Bar Mitzvah, looked upon him with awe, never realizingthat he would some day become his most famous disciple.The second individual was Rabbi Jacob Berab (1474–1546), a native of Castile, whohad been expelled from Spain as a teenager. After spending a number of years inPortugal, Morocco and Algiers, he settled in Egypt in 1523, where he came under theinfluence of the Radbaz. It is also possible that he had met David Reuveni, who hadpassed through Egypt around that time. Already renowned as an important sage, Berabwas almost fifty when he settled in Safed in 1535. A year later, upon the death of RabbiJoseph Saragossi, he was appointed chief rabbi of the community.The third new arrival was Rabbi Joseph Caro (1488–1575), author of the SulchanArukh (Set Table), the recognized Code of Jewish Law. Born in Toledo, he was onlyfour years old when his family was expelled from Spain and emigrated to Portugal.Recognized as a prodigy even at this tender age, he studied together with Rabbi JacobBerab, who was fourteen years his senior, while they both were in Lisbon. With theexpulsion of Jews from Portugal in 1498, he emigrated to Constantinople, and fromthere to Adrianople, in European Turkey."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"By the time he was twenty, Caro was recognized as a leading expert in Jewish law.In 1522, the year of the Ramak's birth and David Reuveni's emergence, he began hismagnum opus, the Bet Yosef (House of Joseph). This book brought together, for thefirst time, in a single volume, virtually every decision that had ever been rendered inJewish Law. Caro worked at this task for twenty years, and this monumental work laterbecame the basis for his better known Shulchan Arukh.While in Adrianopolis, Caro met Shlomo Molcho and was very much impressedwith him. The two became close, and it was from Molcho that the great legalist learnedthe meditative techniques involved in communicating with a Maggid.In 1533, a year after Molcho's execution, Caro moved to Salonica, where heestablished a major Talmudical academy. He became close friends with Rabbi JosephTaitatzak, and apparently reviewed the techniques for summoning a Maggid with him.It was on the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost), probably in 1535, that a Maggid firstrevealed itself to Caro, and the revelations of this Maggid are recorded in a mostinteresting book Maggid Mesharim.At the urging of his Maggid, Caro emigrated to the Holy Land, settling in Safed in1537.11 There he found a community that had grown to over a thousand Jewishfamilies, and he rapidly established himself as a leading figure in the academy ofRabbi Jacob, his older tutor from Lisbon. It was not long before the two brilliant mindsdevised a scheme that, if successful, would alter the entire structure of Jewish life, andpossibly also hasten the coming of the Messiah.What they had in mind was nothing less than to re-establish the ancient rite ofordination. This ordination had far-reaching legal consequences, and had been handeddown from master to disciple from the time of Moses until the Fourth Century. Then,as a result of persecutions in the Holy Land, the chain had been broken.The great Moses Maimonides had written that this Semichah- ordination would haveto be re-established before the coming of the Messiah. He also wrote that even if therewas no master to confer it, it could be granted to any sage by the mutual consent of allthe rabbis in the Holy Land.12 Since the majority of such rabbis resided in Safed at thetime, Berab and Caro felt that the other communities would go along once the projectwas initiated. In 1538, the Rabbis of Safed unanimously decided to confer thisordination on Rabbi Jacob Berab. There was one rabbi, however, who refused to acceptthis ordination. That was the Raibach (Rabbi Levi ibn Chabib: 1480–1541), chief rabbiof Jerusalem, and a result of his opposition, the question of ordination erupted into amajor controversy.As a result, Berab was forced to leave his post and flee to Damascus. Before leaving,he conferred this special Semic/ia-ordination on four of his most outstanding disciples.This Semicha was the highest academic honor that could be conferred on an individual,and it indicated that he had mastered all areas of Talmudic and legal scholarship. Three"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"of the recipients were mature rabbis, who were already renowned as the leadingluminaries of that period. These were Rabbi Joseph Caro, Moshe of Trani, and JosephSagis. The fourth was a sixteen-year-old youth — the Ramak.Rabbi Jacob Berab died in 1541 and was succeeded as rabbi of Safed by RabbiJoseph Caro. A year later, Caro completed his monumental Bef Yosef, a work thatwould establish him for all times as a leading authority in Jewish law.That same year, at the age of twenty, the Ramak heard a voice urging him to beginstudying Kabbalah with Rabbi Shlomo AlKabatz. He was thus initiated into themysteries of the Zohar, and mastered the text completely. This failed to satisfy him,however, since the teachings of the Zohar are often vague, and its system does not havea discernible structure. In order to clarify this in his own mind, the Ramak beganwriting two books. The first, which has only recently been published, was Or Yakar(The Precious Light), a huge commentary on the Zohar.13 It was the second book,however, that was his magnum opus.Known as the Pardes Rimonim (Orchard of Pomegranates), or simply as the Pardes,it was a systematization of all Kabbalistic thought up to that time. Especiallyimportant was the fact that the Ramak reconciled many early schools with theteachings of the Zohar, demonstrating the essential unity of Kabbalah. Using the sameclose logic that Caro had used in his legal works, the Ramak shows how theKabbalistic system has a self-consistent philosophical basis. Were it not for the factthat philosophy and Kabbalah are usually considered to be antagonistic, the Pardeswould be considered a classic of philosphical analysis, as well as one of Kabbalah.Soon after the completion of the Pardes in 1548, The Ramak began engaging inGerushin meditation, together with other members of AlKabatz's group. This was alsothe same year in which Rabbi Joseph Tzayach completed his Sheirit Yosef inJerusalem. The Ramak was familiar with Tzayach's methods, as well as those ofAbulafia, but he apparently preferred a different method, known as Gerushin, whichwas apparently related to that used to evoke a Maggid.An Excerpt FromMaggid Mesharim[The Maggid declared:]Whenever you are in a pure place, constantly think about Torah, fear [of God] andmy Mishnah. Do not abandon Torah and fear, even for a second, even when you eat andspeak. Your tongue should be the heaviest limb of your body, like it was for the lastfew days. All your limbs must constantly be unified toward my service, fear, andTorah. Recall what [the Talmud] says about Rav, that he never spoke an idle word, allhis life.This is what a person must do: He must integrate all of his thoughts toward the fear"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"of God and His worship. It is thus written, “My son, give Me your heart, let your eyesobserve My ways” (Proverbs 23:26). This means that when you keep a commandmentor study Torah, your heart should be unified to God, and you should not think aboutanything else....This should certainly be true when you pray. Nullify every thought that enters yourheart. [Banish] the Evil Urge and its host, as well as the forces of Samael and theSerpent, which accompany this. Unify your heart constantly, at all times, so that everyinstant you will think of nothing other than God, His Torah and His worship.This is the mystery of Unity, through which a person literally unifies himself withhis Creator. The soul attachs itself to Him, and becomes becomes one with Him, sothat the body literally becomes a dwelling place of the Divine Presence. This is whatthe Torah means when it says, “You shall fear God your Lord, and you shall serve Himand attach yourself to Him” (Deuteronomy 10:20).14Therefore, my son, complete a perfect Unification. If you do so, then “I will giveyou a place to walk among those [angels]who stand here”151 will make you worthy togo to the Land of Israel, and to come together with my beloved Shlomo [Molcho].Maggid Mesharim162. COLORSWe have already discussed the method of ascending through the Sefirot using thenames of God, especially as elucidated in Rabbi Joseph Gikatalia's Shaarey Orah(Gates of Light). The Ramak echoes this, and in his Pardes states that the main reasonwhy the Sefirot were created was to provide a ladder upon which one could climb tothe highest spiritual levels.17 The method taught by the Ramak and other members ofthe Safed school, aims at a greater degree of unification than that embraced byGikatalia's school.This system, based on the Zohar, makes use of no other name than theTetragrammaton. The Sefirot are represented by ten different vowel points.18 One canthen meditate on the Tetragrammaton with these different vowel points, and in thismanner, bind himself to whichever Sefirah he desires.Although one can simply meditate on the Names as they would be written in a book,this technique is greatly enhanced when colors are used. When each Name is coloredwith a shade appropriate to that Sefirah, one can bind himself to that Sefirah all themore intimately. The system of colors is discussed at length in the works of RabbiJoseph Tzayach, and the Ramak was apparently aware of these writings.19 But, whileTzayach makes no attempt to relate his system to that of the Zohar, the Ramak showsthat the two are both an identical tradition.Excerpts From"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Pardes RimonimThe Ninth Gate: The Gate of ColorsIn many places in Kabbalistic texts and the Zohar, we find that various colorsparallel the Sefirot. One must be very careful and not imagine that this is to be takenliterally. Color is something physical, used to describe the physical world, and [theSefirot], which are spiritual should not be described with physical properties. If aperson thinks that these are literally the colors of the Sefirot, he destroys the entiresystem, and oversteps the boundaries set by the ancients. One who delves into thisshould therefore be most careful not to assume that anything physical is implied.But actually, these colors allude to the results that are transmitted from the highestRoots. Thus, for example, Gevurah-Strength is responsible for victory in war. Sincethis involves bloodshed, where red blood is spilt, it is fitting to ascribe the color red tothis Sefirah. The color red likewise expresses hatred, anger and rage. This is obvious.We therefore ascribe the color red to the place of Judgment. Furthermore,everything that is red is derived from the power of this Root. This has been discussedin detail in the “Gate of Essence and Function.”20Likewise, the color white indicates mercy and peace. This is because people withwhite [hair] are usually merciful. Thus, for example, the elders and aged do not usuallyfight in armies. Therefore, if you wish to depict peace and the Sefirah of Chesed-Love,you depict it with the color white.There is no question that things that are white emanate from the power of this Root.This too has been explained in the above mentioned Gate.This, then, is the proper interpretation of the relationship between the colors and theSefirot. The colors are used allegorically to allude to their functions and results.[The Sefirot] do not exist in a spatial continuum, and therefore, it is impossible todifferentiate them except through allegory. This can only be done when we use colorsto allegorically represent [the Sefirot. We can then imagine the Sefirot as] beingdifferentiated, ascending, or increasing, according to the relation between one colorand another. The dynamics of the Sefirot can therefore be alluded to completelythrough the interplay of colors. All this is to “ease the physical ear,”21 allowing theverbal expression of these concepts.There is no question that the colors can thus serve as a door to the dynamics of theSefirot. They are also useful in transmitting influence from a given Sefirah.Thus, if you wish to transmit the influence of mercy from the Sefirah of Chesed-Love, [meditate on] the color associated with this Sefirah. Depict the color of theattribute [that you desire]. If you wish pure mercy, then this color will be pure white. Ifyour request involves a lesser degree of mercy, depict a softer white, like that of the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"“mortar of the Temple.”22 We will discuss this further in the “Gate of Kavanah.”Therefore, if an individual wishes to accomplish something through thetransmission of Judgment, he should wear red vestments. He then meditates on theTetragrammaton, depicting it in red [letters]. Similarly, in any activity where onewishes mercy, and desires to transmit the power of Chesed-Love, he should wear whitevestments.This is clearly seen from the Cohen-priests. Their function was to transmit powerfrom the side of Chesed-Love. They therefore wore white vestments, which indicatepeace. On Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), the High Priest would likewiseremove his golden vestments and wear white. The entire service that day wasperformed in white vestments, and the reason given is that “an accuser does notbecome an advocate,”23 [since gold denotes Judgment. The white, however] indicatesthe [mercy] that the High Priest was seeking.The same principle holds true for amulets. When one makes an amulet (kameya, )to transmit Chesed-Love, he should draw the necessary Name in brilliant white[letters]. This will enhance the effectiveness of the Name. Likewise, when one seeksJudgment, he should draw the Name associated with Judgment in red. Goat's blood isoften used for this purpose, since both its color and source then allude to Judgment.24These things are well known and are obvious to those who write amulets, even thoughwe have no portion in these practices.It is thus known that when Names are drawn on amulets, those which involveJudgment are drawn in red, those involving Love, in white, and those pertaining toMercy, in green. This is all known through Maggidim, who taught the methods ofwriting amulets.25"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"All this teaches that the colors can serve as a channel for the forces that aretransmitted from on high.This also closely parallels the rites of some idolators. When they offer incense, theyknow how to influence the power of a particular sign of the Zodiac. While performingthese rites, they would wear vestments [whose color] was associated with their actions.Clear evidence to this concept can be seen in the Breastplate of the High Priest.26This contained twelve precious stones, each one [being a different color], alluding tothe transmission of power from the spiritual source of each of the Twelve Tribes.Do not reject this concept. The alchemists teach that when a person gazes at runningwater, the White Bile is aroused in him. Thus, when a person has insomnia and cannotsleep, they set pipes with running water in front of him, in order toarouse the WhiteBile. This increases the moisture in his body, and he is able to sleep.The same is true in our case. When an initiate flies with his mind, he finds thisinvaluable. Colors that are visible to the eye, or which are depicted in the mind, canhave an effect on the spiritual, even though the colors themselves are physical.The Nefesh (lower soul) can motivate the Ruach (middle spirit), and the Ruach inturn motivates the Neshamah (upper soul). The Neshamah then ascends from oneessence to the next, until it reaches its Source. It can then be motivated by what itimagines.These [thoughts] are like a mirror to the [Divine] Countenance. Through [thethoughts transmitted to] the Source [of the Neshamah], the Countenance can [be madeto] appear red. It then transmits [an influence associated with the color] red [back tothis Source].27 The same can be true of the color white. This is explained in the “Gateof Pipes,” Chapter 1. All influence on the Lower Countenance is the result of humanaction, as explained in the “Gate of Essence and Function,” Chapter 18.The Thirty-Second Gate: The Gate of KavanahChapter 1In the previous Gate, we have discussed how man is a “portion of God from onhigh.” If one is pure and upright in deed, and if he grasps the cords of love, which existin the holy roots of his soul, he can ascend to every level in all the [supernal]Universes. All this has been discussed in the previous Gate.When a person is upright and righteous, he can meditate (kaven) with appropriatethoughts, and ascend through the levels of the transcendental. He must unify the levelsof his soul, joining one part to another, bringing the different levels of his soul to vestthemselves in each other. It then becomes like a single candelabrum, made of differentparts joined together.The individual must then unify the Sefirot, bringing them to bind themselvestogether with a powerful knot. He and his soul then become a channel through which"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"the Sefirot can exert influence. [All of them], from the highest to the lowest [then actin concert] through the powerful cord that binds them together. For when a personbinds his soul to the [Supernal] Soul through his Mishnah,28 it causes the Roots to bebound together with a strong knot. . . .Chapter 2We must now explain the idea of meditating on the Sefirot, since there is someconfusion in this area.Commenting on the verse, “[Who is a great nation that has God close to them,] likethe Lord (YHVH) our God, whenever we call Him” (Deuteronomy 4:7), the Sifri states,“[We call to] Him, and not to His Attributes.”29This is also logical. Why should we approach the King's servants rather than theKing himself? It is certainly fitting that we pray only to the Master of all Treasuries.This being true, why are all our prayers associated with the various Sefirot?The question becomes even stronger when we realize that every word alludes to adifferent Sefirah. Therefore, if one keeps his mind [on the inner essence of his words],it comes out that all his prayers allude to the Sefirot. We are left with nothing that isdirected to the Source of Sources.Besides this, how is it possible to meditate on the Sefirot. If a person attempts todepict any Sefirah in his mind, it is inevitable that he will delineate it and depict it assomething physical. The mind can only depict physical things, so how can he imaginea purely spiritual concept? The mind's eye cannot imagine spiritual entities withoutmaking them finite and physical. It is therefore impossible to meditate on a Sefirah.There is also a third difficulty. When a person thinks about any one of theAttributes, it is inevitable that he will separate it [from the rest]. In his mind, heimagines a separate Attribute, distinct from all the others. This is certainly not proper,since they all must be unified. This is well known.We will now explain the meaning of this, and clarify all these concepts.It is necessary to realize that the Infinite Being (Ain Sof), the blessed King of Kings,cannot be encompassed by any name or word.30 It is not correct to speak of anyattributes in this Essence, since it does not change, and cannot be described. It cannotbe altered, first having one desire and then another, or first engaging in one activityand then in another.Therefore, when one meditates on the Infinite Being, he should not call It El, orElo'ah, or Elohim, or any other name or appelation. All of these names only pertain tothe Sefirot.But, as we have already said, one should not direct his intent toward the Sefirot,heaven forbid, since one who does so falls into a deep pit. It is with regard to this thatthe Sifri says, “To Him, and not to His Attributes.” The true intent, however, is as we"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"have explained in the “Gate of Essence and Vessels.”God is called “Mighty” through the Attribute of Gevurah Strength. This is because itis He who gives [the Sefirah of] Gevurah Strength the power to act. [The same is trueof “Greatness,” which is associated with the Sefirah of Chesed-Love.]31Therefore, when a person says, “The Great God” [in the Amidah], he shouldmeditate on the fact that this alludes to “Greatness” [the Sefirah of Chesed-Love], andthat the word itself is in “Greatness.” Still, his intent should [not be directed to theSefirah itself, but to the Infinite Being, which is] the Essence that permeates“Greatness.” The Same is true of Gevurah-Strength and the other Sefirot.The words are therefore appellations [for the various Attributes] in the Sefirot, andthey are adjectives pertaining to God. The intent, however, is directed only toward theInfinite Being, who is clothed in [the Sefirot] and makes use of them.In the Tikuney Zohar, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai says, “Whenever one pronounces aword, he must keep in mind that speech is Adonoy (), and voice is YHVH (). Onemust bring them together, unifying them in the Concealed Unity (Ain Sof), which binds"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"them together and makes them as one. one's intent must be directed to this alone. Thisis not voice or speech, but thought.”32It is explicitly taught that the Tetragrammaton (YHVH) is associated with theSefirah of Tiferet-Beauty. Since the voice that emanates from [God's] “mouth” is alsoassociated with Tiferet, it is related to [the Tetragrammaton]. Similarly, speech isrelated to the name Adonoy, which is associated with the Sefirah of Malkhut Kingship.Thought, however, is the Infinite Being (Ain Sof), through which these twoAttributes are unified.In the entire worship service, there is no allusion to the Infinite Being (Ain Sof),other than the thought that the worshipper directs toward It. This, however, iseverything. It unifies all the Attributes and Influences. This is the mystery of the BasicEssence that infuses all the Sefirot, through which the Sefirot have power to function.Due to this, the action itself is also ascribed to [this Essence]. This is explained indetail in the “Gate of Essence and Vessels.”This does not mean that one should meditate on the Sefirot or try to imagine them,since this is impossible, as we have already explained. Rather, it means that the Sefirotare associated with ten names, [spelled with the four letters] of the Tetragrammaton.These names are only differentiated by their vowels, as explained in the “Gate of theTetragrammaton.”33 . . . (The Names are given in the Table).One who meditates should concentrate on these Names. He should keep in mind thatnothing can allude to the Attribute that he seeks other than the Tetragrammaton that isdepicted in his mind. These consist of the Four Letters, vocalized in the appropriatemanner. If he does this, he can procede without fear.One should also keep in mind that these Four Letters themselves allude to the TenSefirot. This denotes the fact that all Ten Sefirot agree to the action desired of anysingle Sefirah.It is best if one can depict each Tetragrammaton in the color [associated with theparticulr Sefirah]. His prayer will then help all the more. The only condition is that heshould keep in mind that nothing in this world can depict the action of that Attribute,other than the color associated with it.3. RABBI CHAIM VITALIt would appear appropriate to place the chapter dealing with Rabbi Chaim Vitalafter that dealing with the Ari, since he was a disciple of the latter. But Chaim Vitalwas more closely associated with the older schools of Kabbalah, while the Ari used theZohar to blaze a completely new trail. The disciple will therefore be discussed first.The output of Chaim Vital was prodigious. If not for him, very little if any of theAri's teachings would even be known. But even though Rabbi Chaim was stronglyinfluenced by the Ari, he was only a disciple for less than two years. Within a decade"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"after his master's death, he was showing increased signs of independence, and begandelving into the teaching of the older schools once again. At one point, the Ari came tohim in a dream and asked, “Why have you forgotten me?”34One of the most remarkable books about the meditative Kabbalah, and one of thevery few ever printed, was Chaim Vital's Shaarey Kedushah (Gates of Holiness).Although the author states that he learned these methods from the Ari, nuch of thematerial comes from older sources. Indeed, the unpublished Fourth Section of thisbook consists almost entirely of quotations from older texts.Rabbi Chaim Vital was a most unusual individual. Possessing an extremely brilliantmind, he was acknowledged as an expert in Kabbalah even before he met the Ari. Atthe time of this first meeting, he was engaged in writing a commentary on the Zohar.35Although only twenty-seven at the time, he was already an outstanding expert inalchemy, astronomy, astrology, Kabbalistic magic, and all the occult arts. When ChaimVital first heard of the Ari, he hesitated to visit him, considering himself a far superiorKabbalist.It did not take long before Rabbi Chaim became aware of the Ari's superior visionand insight, but the Ari also saw his main disciple in this lofty soul. On one occasion,he tells Chaim Vital that he had come to Safed especially to teach him, and at anothertime, he told his disciple that he had been born into this world only to teach him.36 Thedisciple himself was an expert in all Kabbalistic meditations, and was aware of allschools. In many ways, his Shaarey Kedushah, especially the Fourth Part, is ananthology of these teachings.Rabbi Chaim was born in 1543 in Safed to Rabbi Joseph Vital, who was also knownas Calabrese, since his family originated in Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot. RabbiJoseph was a scribe who specialized in making Tefillin, and the Tefillin capsules thathe made were famed as the finest available.37 Chaim's childhood in Safed must havebeen fascinating, since this city had become one of the most important hubs of Jewishthought, both Kabbalistic and otherwise. He was a child of five when the Ramakcompleted his great Pardes Rimonim, and at the age of seven, he saw the first printedcopies of Rabbi Joseph Caro's monumental legal work, the Bet Yosef. As a ten year oldlad, he witnessed the return to Safed of the great Radbaz, who had served as chiefRabbi of Cairo for over forty years.Safed was a city steeped in Kabbalah, not only in its theoretical and philosophicalforms, but also in its most occult aspects. The city abounded with chiromancers, oildrop readers and fortune tellers, and Rabbi Chaim even associated with Arab mysticswho were involved in crystal gazing and geomancy.38 Although the Ari disapproved ofthese practices, soon after his master's death, Chaim Vital renewed his interest in them.Shortly after his Bar Mitzvah, Chaim became a student of Rabbi Moshe AlShech(1508–1600). “The AlShech,” as he is usually called, is best known as the author of"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Torat Moshe, which is considered to be the most important homiletic commentariesever written on the Bible. A native of Adrianople, he studied there under Rabbi JosephCaro, and later in Salonica, under Joseph Taitatzak. In Safed, Caro was told by hisMaggid to speak to AlShech, and instruct him to pay attention to the young ChaimVital, since he was an extraordinary soul and would someday be an important leader.In 1558, when Vital was fifteen years old, an event took place that wouldpermanently change the entire status of the Kabbalah. This was the first printing of theZohar in Mantua, Italy. There had been considerable dispute regarding the propriety ofopenly publishing a text that dealt with the highest mysteries, but a leading authority,Rabbi Isaac de Lattes (1502–1571), rendered a decision permitting it. The Zohar wouldnow not just be the province of those well enough connected to procure a manuscriptcopy, but would be available for all who wished to purchase it.Rabbi Chaim was married at the age of twenty-two, but for some reason, could notconsummate the marriage for nine months, during which time he was led into veryserious temptations.39 It was around this time that he also became a disciple of theRamak in Kabbalah, and his brilliant mind mastered the complex system with relativeease. Before long he had begun his own commentary on the Zohar, following theRamak's principles. Still, he was hounded by temptations, and for some two years,abandoned his studies almost completely.Seeking advice from the ancient Radbaz, Vital was informed of the Kabbalisticschool in Damascus, possibly that of Rabbi Joseph Tzayach, who was still teachingthere at the time. Rabbi Chaim went to damascus in 1569, continuing his work on theZohar commentary. He was soon to be brought back to Safed by an event that wouldmake the city a citadel of Kabbalah: the arrival of the Ari.The relationship between the Ari and Chaim Vital is most significant, and will bediscussed at length in the next chapter. In all, Vital was the Ari's disciple for onlytwenty-two months, but during this time, he was able to absorb a prodigious amount.He became the leading expounder of the Ari's system, writing over a dozen largevolumes on the subject.After the death of the Ari in 1572, Chaim Vital frequently saw him in dreams, but asthe years passed, these nocturnal visits became increasingly infrequent. Rabbi Chaimsoon began giving his own lectures in Kabbalah, and in 1576 went to Egypt, possibly tolink up with the Kabbalistic school founded by Abraham Castro, which used Tzayach'smethods. From there, he returned to Jerusalem, where in 1590, he received theSemichah-ordination from Rabbi Moshe AlShech, who had in turn received it fromJoseph Caro.40 Rabbi Chaim Vital settled in Damascus in 1594, and with the exceptionof occasional visits to Safed, remained there until his death in 1620.4. GATES OF HOLINESS"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Rabbi Chaim Vital's Shaarey Kedushah (Gates of Holiness) stands alone as beingthe only textbook of Kabbalistic meditation ever printed. Indeed, the Fourth Section,which deals with the specific methods, was never published. The printer of the firstedition, which came out in 1738, states that it is for this reason that this section mustremain unpublished, as we have discussed in the introduction. Although thisremarkable book has gone into over thirty editions, the Fourth Section has never beenpublished.It is not known precisely when this book was written, but it was obviously written anumber of years after the Ari's death, when his influence no longer overwhelmedChaim Vital.41 Missing from this book is the kaleidoscopic style that distinguishesVital's earlier writings, where he is basically expounding the teachings of the Ari.Furthermore, very little is mentioned of the method of Yichudim (Unifications),which, as we shall see in the next chapter, was the main meditative techniqueadvocated by the Ari.Still, even though he is clearly his own man in this book, the author does not forgethis indebtedness to his master. He writes, “In [this book] I will explain mysteries thatwere not grasped by earlier generations. These I received from the lips of the holyman, the angel of the Lord of Hosts, the Godly Rabbi Isaac Luria, of blessedmemory.”42Although this would seem to indicate that the methods discussed in ShaareyKedushah were taught by the Ari, there is considerable evidence to the contrary. In allthe voluminous literature that is attributed to the Ari, we find no evidence of thesemethods, especially those discussed in the Fourth Section.Rabbi Chaim, however, leaves very little doubt that he himself made use of thesemethods. He writes, “In the Fourth Section, [I will speak] of the methods themselves,through which one attains Ruach HaKodesh. I myself have tried and tested them, andfound them to be authentic.”43Although the Fourth Section was never published, it exists in a number ofmanuscripts, some in private hands, and a few in library collections.44 One of thegreatest surprises in this unpublished section is the fact that it begins by advocating themethods of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, as taught in his Chayay Olam HaBah (Life of theFuture World). After a discussion of this method, Vital goes on to quote a long portionfrom the Abulafia's Sefer HaCheshek (Book of Passion), without actually quoting it byname.45This advocacy of Abulafia's methods may have been one of the underlying reasonswhy this Fourth Section was never printed. Such highly respected authorities as theRashba, Rabbi Judah Chayit, and Yashar of Candia had denounced Abulafia's works inno uncertain terms. If it had become publicly known that Rabbi Chaim Vital hadadvocated these methods, the entire status of his teachings may have been undermined."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"A good deal of the material in this Fourth Section has been published elsewhere, andthis includes quotations from the works of the Ramban, Rabbi Menachem Recanti(1223–1290), and Rabbi Judah Chayit.46 Of particular interest is the context in whichhe quotes the Ramban's Iggeret HaMussar (Epistle of Admonishment), which the latterhad sent to his son in Barcelona.47 Although this is usually cited merely as aninspirational text, here it is quoted as an important method for attaining enlightenment.Here can also be found a number of quotations from the works of Rabbi Isaac ofAcco. The most important of these is his discussion of stoicism, taken from his MeiratEynayim, which we have already quoted. Also to be found here are a number of otherquotations from Rabbi Isaac of Acco which are also included in Rabbi Eliahu di Vidas'Reshit Chokhmah (Beginning of Wisdom).48 Rabbi Chaim Vital also provides thecomplete text of the “Gate of Kavanah,” which we have also discussed earlier, as wellas a similar text that appears to advocate a very similar method.49One of the most significant things that we find in this Fourth Section is some insightinto Rabbi Joseph Caro's Maggid, the angelic “spokesman” who came to him andtaught him. It is well-established that this Maggid was closely associated with Caro'sintense study of the Mishnah (the earliest codification of the Oral Torah).50In this context, it is important to say something about the nature of the Mishnah.The original Jewish tradition consisted of two parts, often referred to as two Torahs.The first was the “Written Torah,” which consisted of the well-known scroll. Thesecond, however, was called the “Oral Torah,” and it consisted of the unwrittentradition given to Moses on Sinai. This Oral Tradition was handed down by word ofmouth until the harsh Roman persecutions threatened to extinguish it completely.Finally, around the year 205, Rabbi Judah the Prince compiled it into a written code. Itis significant to note that while not included in the Mishnah, the main body of theKabbalah was also part of this same Oral Tradition.Here, in the Fourth Part of Shaarey Kedushah, the author also speaks about a type ofHitbodedut meditation where one meditates on a passage from the Mishnah, oftensimply called “a Mishnah.” The initiate is instructed to seclude himself in a room,wrap himself in his Prayer Shawl, and sit with his eyes closed. He is then to depicthimself leaving behind his body and ascending to heaven.When the initiate reaches this state, he is to take a passage from the Mishnah, andrepeat it over and over like a mantra. This produces a very high meditative state, whereone can actually clothe himself in the soul of the Sage of the Mishnah. If one does thiscorrectly, that Sage will actually speak through the initiates mouth. Alternatively, hemay visualize a mystical message.51Although it is not definite that this was the method used by Caro, it is certainly veryclosely related. In one place, Caro mentions that he communicated with his Maggidafter reading several chapters from the Mishnah:52 Even if he did not repeat the same"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"text over and over, he was so familiar with the Mishnah that reciting any part could beused as a technique for clearing his mind.It is also significant to note that Rabbi Chaim Vital also made use of this method. Inhis diary, he speaks of inducing a state of Hitbodedut-meditation by repeating aMishnah three times.53 Although this took place shortly after he came under theinfluence of the Ari, from the context, it is evident that he was aware of this methodeven earlier. There is a distinct possibility that he may have learned it from RabbiJoseph Caro. It is also important to note the apparent similarity between this methodand that of Gerushin used by the Ramak.Also very significant in this Fourth Section is the discussion of how to domeditation involving Yichudim (Unifications). Although this is discussed at length inthe teachings of the Ari, as we shall see in the next chapter, there is no mention thereof the precise techniques. Here in Shaarey Kedushah, however, a very similar methodis discussed, and the technique is spelled out in detail.54The Hebrew Alphabet in Ashurit ScriptAccording to Rabbi Joseph Caro:Variations according to the Ari:The initiate is to spend the entire day in preparation, immersed in Torah study, notspeaking any unnecessary words, and concluding with actual immersion in the Mikvah.He is then to seclude himself, wear white garments, and divest himself of all physicalsensation. Mentally, he then ascends from one firmament to the next, until he reachesthe highest one, which is called Aravot.55When one reaches this level, he is to depict the firmament as a tremendous whitecurtain. Upon this curtain is the Name or letter combination upon which he ismeditating. The letters are written in Ashurit, the script to write a Torah. Each letterappears brilliantly white, but at the same time, it is shaded with the color appropriateto the particular Sefirah with which it is associated."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"After depicting the letters in this manner, one must expand them, until they fill theentire mind. Each letter should apper as a dazzling white mountain, filling the entirefield of vision. One can then combine the letters or Names, or, alternatively, permutethe letters through the methods of tzeruf.This method provides important insight into the method of Yichudim, as well astechniques involving meditation on Divine Names, as taught by Rabbi Joseph Gikataliaand the Ramak. But what is also highly significant is the close parallels to thesemethods found in other systems of Kabbalah meditation. Thus, in his Chayay OlamHabah, Abulafia speaks of a very similar technique. He says, “The letters are withoutquestion the root of all wisdom and knowledge, and they themselves are the substanceof prophecy. In a prophetic vision, they appear as if they were solid bodies, actuallyspeaking to the individual. They appear like pure living angels . . . and sometimes theindividual sees them as mountains.”56A very similar idea is also found in the teachings of Rabbi Isaac of Acco. In hisOtzar Chaim, he speaks of the proper methods of meditating on Names and prayers. Hewrites, “One must imagine that before his eyes is a book made entirely of white fire.The letters, words, and combinations that he is reading are written in this book withletters of black fire. As he reads, his physical eyes should be on the words, while hismind's eye should be on the . . . Infinite Being (Ain Sof).”57 This is very reminiscent ofthe Talmudic teaching that the original Torah was written with “Black fire on whitefire.”58The earlier sections of Shaarey Kedushah deal at length with the preparation thatone must undergo before involving oneself in the higher forms of meditation. Thetextalso speaks about trhe prophetic state at length, as well as that of the Hekhalot, and wehave presented most of this material elsewhere.59Excerpts FromShaarey KedushahThe Seventh Gate: Ruach HaKodesh in our TimesIn the previous gate, we have warned the initiate regarding the pitfalls that lie in theroad leading to enlightenment. Still, he should not give up. Commenting on the verse,“Deborah was a prophetess” (Judges 4:4), the prophet Elijah taught his disciples, “Icall heaven and earth to witness, that any individual, man or woman, Jew or gentile,freeman or slave, can have Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) come upon him. It alldepends on his deeds.”60Our own eyes have seen, and our own ears have heard distinguished individuals whohave attained the level of Ruach HaKodesh, even in our times. Some of these"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"individuals can predict the future. Others have mastered wisdom that had never beenrevealed to previous generations.In order that those who wish to enter the Sanctuary not be discouraged, I willexplain a few concepts, opening the door like the eye of a needle. “For God will notwithhold good from those who walk uprightly.”61 First, I will explain a few generalprinciples involving enlightenment. Then, in the Eighth Gate, I will discuss a numberof specific practices.The best way of all is that taught by Elijah. This was the way of the early saints(Hasidim Rishonim), also known as the Pharisees.62 The technique is as follows:One must first repent every sin he has ever done, rectifying all the spiritual damagehe has caused. He must then perfect his soul through keeping the positiveCommandments, as well as through complete concentration in prayer and diligentTorah study without ulterior motive. He must continue like an ox under its yoke, untilthe physical becomes weak. This should also include such disciplines as minimizingthe amount of food one eats, waking up at midnight, shunning all unworthy traits,separating oneself from other people, and not speaking unnecessary words. One mustalso constantly purify his body through immersion in the Mikvah.After this, one should meditate (hitboded) occasionally on the fear of God. Heshould mentally depict the letters of the Tetragrammaton. At this time, he should becareful to keep his thoughts away from all worldly vanities, binding himself to the loveof God with great passion.Through this, one can be worthy of Ruach HaKodesh in one of the following aspects:The first aspect consists of a transmission to the individual's soul of the HighestLight, from the Root of the highest levels of his soul. Such a revelation is RuachHaKodesh in its purest form.The second aspect comes about through the study of Torah or observance of somecommandment. Our sages taught, “When a person keeps a commandment, he earns anAdvocate [Angel].”63 This actually means that an angel is created through one'sactions. If this individual does this consistently according to the law, with greatKavanah, then this angel will reveal itself to him. This is the meaning of those angelscalled Maggidim which are mentioned in various writings. But if the commandment isnot kept according to the Law (halakhah), then this angel will be made up of good andevil, combining truth and falsehood.The third aspect is that as a result of one's piety, Elijah will reveal himself to him.The greater one's piety, the greater will be his enlightenment.The fourth aspect is greater than [the previous two]. This involves the revelation ofthe soul of a Tzadik (saint), who has already passed away. This Tzadik may share thesame root with the individual's soul, or may come from other roots.

People who are worthy of this attain a level where they gain knowledge ofhigh wisdom and the hidden mysteries of the Torah. This, too, depends on one's deeds.The fifth aspect is the lowest of them all. This involves dreams where the future andother knowledge is revealed to the individual. This is also close to Ruach HaKodesh.The method discussed earlier brings one on a straight path. The individual does notuse mystical oaths to bind the Supernal Beings, but only resorts to the power of hisgood deeds and sanctification of the self. He can then be assured that the RuachHaKodesh that he attains will be pure, without any admixture of evil whatsoever.This, however, is not true when a person attempts to coerce [the Supernal Beings. Itis true that one may have success] through methods involving mystical oaths, specificactions, prayers and Yichudim. But if one makes the slightest error, it is possible thathis revelation will be inermingled with Outside Forces.There are also other methods involving specific techniques, which will be discussedin the Fourth Section. These can bring the above-mentioned aspects to a person, evenwhen they do not come automatically Those methods, however, require great holinessand purity, since otherwise they will give rise to a mixed revelation, as mentionedabove.The first way that we have discussed, however, is the path taken by the earliergenerations. It is the path referred to by the Ramban in his commentary on the Torah.64This is also the significance of Ben Azzai's experience, when he would [simply] study,and would be surrounded by burning flames, as the Ramban explains in his IggeretHaKodesh (Holy Epistle).65The Eighth Gate: Methods of Sanctifying OneselfOne must purify himself in four ways:First, one must repent all of his sins, wether they involve violating the Torah'sprohibitions, neglecting its positive commandments or even transgressing rabbinicallaws or adhering to unworthy traits. Such repentance must include a resolve never torepeat the sin or return to the bad trait. Such repentance is especially important for sinsfor which the Torah prescribes a penalty of being [spiritually] “cut off,” or those whichinvolve a desecration of God's Name.66 This includes violation of the Sabbath, themenstrual rules, sexual pollution, oaths — even if they involve the truth — gazing atforbidden members of the opposite sex, malicious gossip, talebearing, mockery andidle chatter. One must also keep himself from pride, anger, oversensitivity, anddepression, behaving with modesty and humility and rejoicing in his portion.The second purification involves the meticulous observance of all 248commandments of the Torah [which parallel the 248 parts of the human body], as wellas the legislated commandments. Particularly, it involves keeping set times for Torah"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"study, praying with Kavanah reciting all blessings and grace after meals with Kavanah,loving one's fellow man, and honoring the Sabbath in every detail. One should alsowake up each night at midnight to study Torah and mourn for Jerusalem. Whatever onedoes should be with love, for the sake of heaven.The third and fourth purifications involve specific preparations through which onesanctifies himself for Ruach HaKodesh.The first of these involves purification of the body, through immersion in theMikvah and clean clothing.The second should be done when one actually prepares to receive Ruach HaKodesh,after the other good traits have become part of his nature.67You should be in a room by yourself, after immersion and sanctification. It shouldbe a place where you will not be distracted by the sound of human voices or thechirping of birds. The best time to do this is shortly after midnight.Close your eyes and divest your thoughts of all worldly things. It should be as ifyour soul had left your body, and you should be as devoid of sensation as a corpse.Then strengthen yourself with a powerful yearning, meditating on the supernaluniverse. There you should attach yourself to the Root of your soul and to the SupernalLights.It should seem as if your soul had left your body and had ascended on high. Imagineyourself standing in the supernal universes.If you make use of a Yichud (Unification), have in mind that through it you aretransmitting Light and Sustenance to all universes. Keep in mind that you, too, willreceive your portion in the end.Meditate (hitboded) in thought for a short time, and attempt to sense if Spirit hadrested on you.If you do not feel anything, it can be assumed that your are not fit and ready for it.You should therefore strengthen yourself all the more with worship and holiness. Aftera few days, you should meditate again in this manner, until you are worthy that theSpirit should rest upon you.When the spirit rests on you, you must still discern if it is pure and clean, or fromthe Other Side, a mixture of good and evil. Keep in mind what happened to Ben Zomaand Ben Azzai when they ascended to the Orchard.68 You can discern this through whatis revealed. It can consist completely of truth, or it can be truth mixed with falsehood.Occasionally, the revelation will consist of idle concepts, dealing with worldlyvanities, or ideas that do not conform to the teachings of the Torah. When this occurs,you must repel yourself from it. You must then continue to fortify yourself withworship, until the revelation is faithful, based on the fear of heaven.At first, the spirit [of Ruach HaKodesh] will rest on you occasionally, at distantintervals.

A HUMAN ANGELThere are a select number of individuals who live on a plane so high above the restof humanity that it seems as if they are a completely different, higher species of being.They teach, but we grasp but little, and from the few crumbs that we glean, we canbuild mountains. Such a person was Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-1572), renowned as thegreatest Kabbalist of modern times.Rabbi Isaac Luria is commonly known as the Ari (), an acronym standing forElohi Rabbi Isaac ()—the Godly Rabbi Isaac. No other master or sage everhad this extra letter, standing for—Elohi—Godly—prefaced to his name. This was asign of what his contemporaries thought of him. Later generations, fearsome that thisappelation might be misunderstood, said that this Alef stood for Ashkenazi, indicatingthat his family had originated in Germany, as indeed it had. But the original meaning isthe correct one, and to this day among Kabbalists, Rabbi Isaac Luria is only referred toas the “Holy Ari.”It is relatively easy for a great leader to become a legendary figure centuries afterhis death. There are even cases where people become legends in their time, especiallyto the masses who never get too close to them. But usually, the closer one gets to thelegend, the more it wanes, until those closest to him see the legendary character aslittle more than a gifted human being, if that. In the case of the Ari, the exact oppositeis true. His closest disciple, Rabbi Chaim Vital, who spent days and nights with him,saw him as nothing less than a human angel.In one place there is a responsum that Rabbi Joseph Caro sent to the the Ari.1 TheAri is inquiring about an involved legal problem involving a quasi-partnership whereone partner dies and the merchandise is lost. The great Joseph Caro answers like astudent before his master, hanging on to every word of the Ari's question. One mustremember that at this time, Caro's momumental code, the Bet Yosef, had already beenprinted, and he was considered one of the foremost leaders of that period.Characteristically, he writes with the greatest of authority, even to the foremostluminaries of that generation. Yet before the Ari, he is totally subjected, bothspiritually and intellectually. There are also legends that Caro wished to enroll as adisciple of the Ari in Kabbalah, but was discouraged. The Ari said that Caro was meantto be an authority in Law, and not in mysticism.2"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The teachings of the Ari were afforded status as a primary authority, on the samelevel as the Zohar itself. Every custom of the Ari was scrutinized, and many wereaccepted, even against previous practice. The great Polish codifier, Rabbi AbrahamGombiner (1635-1683), author of the Magen Avraham (Shield of Abraham), takes theAri's personal customs as legally binding precedents. In deciding disputes that hadremained unresolved for centures, he often cites the Ari's custom as the final authority.The fact that the Ari had acted in a certain manner was enough to convince this tough-minded legalist that this was the correct opinion.The Ari was born in Jerusalem in 1534, and it is said that Elijah himself attended hiscircumcision ceremony. By the time he was eight, he was recognized as a wonderchild, a prodigy who already outshone the greatest minds of Jerusalem. At this tenderage, when most children are just beginning to read, he had already mastered theintricasies of the Talmud, and had committed dozens of volumes to memory. Had heremained nothing more than a Talmudic scholar, he would have joined the ranks of thegreatest of all times.The Ari's father died while he was still a young child, and since she was unable tosupport the family, his mother went to Egypt, where they lived with her brother,Mordecai Frances, a wealthy tax agent. The young prodigy was placed under thetutelage of Rabbi Betzalel Ashkenazi (1520-1592), best known for his importantTalmudic commentary, the Shitta Mekubetzet (Embracing System). There is alsoevidence that the young lad also studied under the great Radbaz, who was then thechief rabbi of Cairo.3 According to a reliable account, the Ari himself also wrote alarge Talmudic commentary around this time.4Having thoroughly mastered the maze of Talmudic thought, the Ari discovered theZohar when he was seventeen, obtaining his own manuscript copy. But even moreimportant were the fifteen years that he spent in meditation, first with Rabbi Betzaleland then by himself. It is not certain what methods he used, but it is known that boththe Radbaz and Rabbi Chaim Vital were aware of Abulafia's works and speak highly ofthem.Another interesting link that needs exploration involves Rabbi Joseph Tzayach,whom we have already discussed at length. It is known that at least two of Tzayach'smajor works were dedicated to Abraham Castro, who was master of the mint in Egypt.From the wording of his dedication, it appears that besides being a majorphilanthropist, Castro was looked upon as a saint and a Kabbalist of major proportions.There are also indications that Castro had founded a secret school in Egypt based onTzayach's teachings.When we couple this with the fact that it was Castro who gained the Radbaz'sappointment as chief rabbi of Cairo, and that the Radbaz corresponded with Tzayach,we see an important link. The Ari was associated with the Radbaz's school, and hestudied with his major disciple, Rabbi Batzalel Ashkenazi. This school, however,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"seemed to have an intimate relationship with Joseph Tzayach.It would certainly be very significant to discover a link between the Ari andTzayach, but no direct evidence exists. While the style of the Ari exhibits the samedetailed intricacy as Tzayach, the Ari's system is built entirely upon the Zohar, whileTzayach apparently avoids the Zohar completely. Still, the Ari almost certainly knewof Tzayach's teachings, and the connection between the two should be further explored.The most important meditative practice of the Ari involved the Zohar itself. RabbiChaim Vital presents evidence that the Ari would spend days, and sometimes weeks,engrossed in a single passage in the Zohar, remaining with it until he had grasped itsdeepest meaning.5 While it is entirely possible that this was a purely intellectualexercize, it is also highly possible that the Ari used passages of the Zohar like amantra, just as others used passages from the Bible and Mishnah. The states inducedby such meditation would have resulted in precisely the Zohar consciousness that isevident throughout the Ari's teachings.The Ari spent two years meditating alone in a hut near the Nile, and at the end ofthis period he received a command to go to the Holy Land, according to legend, fromthe lips of Elijah the Prophet. Without discounting this legend completely, we can alsospeculate that the Radbaz also exerted some influence in this area. This ancient sagehad left for the Holy Land in 1553, and was already in Safed at the time. There is noquestion that he knew both the Ramak and Rabbi Chaim Vital, both of whom wereamong the world's leading Kabbalists. Perhaps the Radbaz realized that bringing theAri together with these forces would have the effect of raising the Kabbalah tounprecedented heights, as indeed it did.In any case, the Ari arrived in Safed during the summer of 1570, and began byconcealing his gifts completely. He was only there a short time when the Ramak diedon June 26, 1570 (23 Tammuz, 5330). According to legend, the Ramak had alreadydecided that the Ari would succeed him as leader of the Safed school, and this waspointed out by a pillar of fire that followed the Ramak's beirThere are clear indications that around this time, Rabbi Chaim Vital was deeplyinvolved in his commentary on the Zohar, and was not aware of the Ari at all.6 RabbiChaim might have been in Damascus at the time, aware neither of the Ari's coming norof the Ramak's demise. He writes that he did not see the Ari until six months after hehad arrived in Safed, and that one reason was that he initially thought that his ownknowledge of the Kabbalah was superior to that of the Ari.7 All that it took, however,was a single meeting, and Rabbi Chaim was convinced of the Ari's awesome stature. Itwas not long before he begged to become the latter's disciple.According to our best estimates, the initial meeting between the Ari and RabbiChaim Vital took place in February of 1571.8 It was at this time that the Ari informedhim that he had come from Egypt specifically to teach him, and that this was one of the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"most important tasks in life. From that time on, the two were inseparable.It is difficult to imagine the amount of information that passed between the two.According to his own accounts, Rabbi Chaim was a disciple of the Ari for less thaneighteen months, and during this period, he gained a complete mastery of the Ari'ssystem. The writings that Chaim Vital produced in this field encompass over a dozenlarge volumes, each one intricately compiled and written in an extremely terse style. Itis from this that we can understand the genius of these two individuals, as well as theirhigh spiritual level.The Ari passed away on July 15, 1572 (5 Ab, 5332), barely two years after he hadarrived in Safed.9 During his brief stay there, he had assembled a group ofapprozimately a dozen disciples, with Chaim Vital at their head, and they continued toreview his teachings. For the most part, it was Rabbi Chaim who put them into writing.The main works are the Etz Chaim (Tree of Life) and Pri Etz Chaim (Fruit of the Treeof Life), as well as the Eight Gates, which deal with everything from Biblecommentary to divine inspiration and reincarnation.SOURCES"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"[The Ari's] father died while he was still a child. Because of poverty, he went toEgypt, where he lived with his wealthy uncle. His brilliance continued to shine indialectic (pilpul) and logic.By the time he was fifteen, his expertise in Talmud had overwhelmed all the sagesin Egypt. At this time he married his uncle's daughter.After he was married, he spent seven years meditating (hitboded) with his master,Rabbi Betzalel Ashkenazi. He then meditated alone for six years.He then added to this, meditating an reaching higher levels of holiness. This he didfor two years straight, in a house near the Nile. There he would remain alone, utterlyisolated,, not speaking to any human being.Th only time he would return home would be on the eve of the Sabbath, just beforedark. But even at home, he would not speak to anyone, even to his wife. When it wasabsolutely necessary for him to say something, he would say it in the least possiblenumber of words, and then, he would speak only in the Holy Tongue (Hebrew).He progressed in this manner and was worthy of Ruach HaKodesh. At times, Elijahrevealed himself and taught him the mysteries of the Torah.He was also worthy for his soul to ascend every night, and troops of angels wouldgreet him to safeguard his way, bringing him to the heavenly academies. These angelswould ask him wich academy he chose to visit. Sometimes it would be that of RabbiShimon bar Yochai, and other times he would visit the academies of Rabbi Akiba orRabbi Eliezer the Great. On occasion he would also visit the academies of the ancientProphets.10When Rabbi Chim Vital first began to learn with the Ari, he could not grasp any ofhis teachings, and would forget everything that he would learn. Then one day, the twotook a small boat to Tiberias. When they passed the pillars of an ancient synagogue,the Ari took a cup of water from the sea and gave it to Rabbi Chaim to drink. He said,“Now that you have drunk this water, you will grasp this wisdom, since the water isfrom Miriam's well.” From then on, Rabbi Chaim was able to grasp the Ari'steachings.11In every generation, there were exceptional individuals who were worthy of RuachHaKodesh. Elijah revealed himself to these individuals and taught them the mysteriesof this Wisdom (Kabbalah). This is found many places in the books of the Kabbalists.In his discussion of the Priestly Blessing, [Rabbi Menachem] Recanti (1228-1290)writes, “Elijah had revealed himself to Rabbi [David], head of the Rabbinical Court,and had taught him the wisdom of the Kabbalah. He taught this to his son, the Raavad(Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posqueres: 1120-1198), and he also experienced arevelation of Elijah. The tradition was passed to his son, Rabbi Isaac the Blind, whowas blind from birth, and to him Elijah also revealed himself. He gave the tradition tohis two disciples, the first being Rabbi Ezra, who wrote a commentary on the Song of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Songs, and the second was Rabbi Azriel. From them, it was given over to theRamban.”12In his commentary on Maimonides' Code, the Raavad himself writes, “RuachHaKodesh has been revealed in our Academy for many years. . . .”13 Elsewhere helikewise writes, “This was revealed to me, as a mystery of God to those who fearHim.”14But I must also sing praise, for in each generation God's love is with us.... In thisgeneration too, God of the first and last did not withhold such a leader . . . He sent usan angel . . . the great Godly pious Rabbi, my master and teacher, our mentor, RabbiIsaac Luria Ashkenazi, of blessed memory.[The Ari] was overflowing with Torah. He was thoroughly expert in the Bible,Mishnah, Talmud, Pilpul, Midrash, Agadah, Workings of Creation, and Workings ofthe Merkava. He was expert in the conversation of trees, the conversation of birds, andthe speech of angels.15 He could read faces in the manner outlined in the Zohar.16 Hecould discern all that any individual had done, and could see what they would do in thefuture. He could read people's thoughts, often before the thought even entered theindividual's mind. He knew future events, and was aware of everything happening hereon earth, and what was decreed in heaven.He knew the mysteries of reincarnation, who had been born previously, and who washere for the first time. He could look at a person and tell him how he was connected tothe Supernal Man, and how he was related to Adam. He could read wondrous things inthe light of a candle or in the flame of a fire.With his eyes he gazed and was able to see the souls of the righteous, whether thosewho had died recently, or those who had lived in ancient times. With these he studiedthe true mysteries. By a person's odor he was able to know all that he had done, anability that the Zohar attributes to the Holy Child.17It was as if all these mysteries were lying in his bosom, ready to be used wheneverhe desired. He did not have to meditate (hitboded) to seek them out.All this we saw with our own eyes. These are not things that we heard from others.They were wondrous things, that had not been seen on earth since the time of RabbiShimon bar Yochai.None of this was attained through the Practical Kabbalah, heaven forbid. There is astrong prohibition against using these arts.Instead, it came automatically, as a result of his piety and asceticism, after manyyears of study in both the ancient and newer Kabbalistic texts. He then increased hispiety, asceticism, purity and holiness until he reached a level where Elijah wouldconstantly reveal himself to him, speaking to him “mouth to mouth,” and teaching himthese mysteries.This is the same thing that had happened to the Raavad, as Recanti states. Even"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"though true prophecy no longer exists, Ruach HaKodesh is still here, manifest throughElijah. It is as the prophet Elijah taught his disciples, commenting on the verse,“Deborah was a prophetess” (Judges 4:4): “I call heaven and earth to bear witness, thatany individual, man or woman, Jew or Gentile, freeman or slave, can have RuachHaKodesh bestowed upon him. It all depends on his deeds.”18Rabbi Chaim Vital.19There was no one like [the Ari] since the days of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.Furthermore, he revealed to us that he was a reincarnation of Rabbi Shimon barYochai, and that his disciples were reincarnations of those of Rabbi Shimon.It is for this reason that when he went to [Rabbi Shimon's cave in] Meron, he wouldplace them in an appropriate order. He himself would sit in the place of Rabbi Shimonbar Yochai, Rabbi Chaim Vital would be set in the place of Rabbi Eliezer, son of RabbiShimon, and Rabbi Benjamin Cohen, in the place of Rabbi Abba. The other sevendisciples would be set in the places of the “seven Eyes of God,” each one in his properplace according to his incarnation.20He revealed to us more than any prophet or seer. Even Ezekiel only revealed themystery of the Merkava in the Universe of Beriyah. But the Ari revealed the mysteriesof Atzilut, even reaching to the Universes of the Infinite, which are “Bonds, Dots andStripes.”21 “How great is the good that You have hidden for those who fear You”(Psalms 31:20).His level was high above any angle or Maggid. He knew all that was on high andbelow, as well as what was decreed in the Tribunal on High—and he could annul thesedecrees.In many cases, he was able to indicate where the earlier Kabbalists had beenmistaken. An example of this is with regard to the seven Sabbatical Years.22Even the Maggid that was revealed to Rabbi Joseph Caro did not know the innermeaning of the Zohar, and was occasionally mistaken. This is because an angel orMaggid is only from the Universe of Yetzirah, while the soul is from the Universe ofBeriyah. . . . The sould of a Tzaddik (saint), however, can also be from the Universe ofAtzilut.The soul of our Master (the Ari) was from a level of the Partzuf of Arikh Anpin[which is the level of Keter-Crown, the highest of Atzilut].Rabbi Mosheh of Prague (1630-1705).23"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"2. THE SYSTEMThe Ari's Kabbalistic system covers literally thousands of pages, and pervadesvirtually every area of thought. It is utterly impossible to adequately summarize it, andattempts to do so are most often onesided and unsuccessful. Still, there are a number ofgeneral principles that are dominant, and these are particularly important inunderstanding the Ari's system of meditation.The basic elements of the Ari s system are the Ten Sefirot, the Four Universes, andthe Five levels of the Soul. These concepts are discussed widely in the Zohar, and playan important role in the teachings of such masters as the Ramak. It is upon these oldersystems that the Ari builds.Three of the most opaque books of the Zohar are the Sifra DeTzeniuta (ConcealedBook) and the Greater and Lesser Idras. In these books, we find ideas that in otherZoharic literature are only alluded to in the vaguest terms. While other sources speakprimarily about the Sefirot, here the discussion revolves different spiritual entities—the Partzufim (Archetype Personas). The Ari clarifies the significance of these byrevealing the one-to-one relationship that exists between the Partzufim and theSeifirot. (See Table).While the simpler Kabbalah involving the Sefirot appears to speak of the statics ofthe highest Universes, the system of Partzufim involves their dynamic interactions.When they were first created, the Sefirot were simple points, which could not interactwith each other. They could therefore not give anything to each other. All they coulddo was receive from the Infinite Being (Ain Sof), and for this reason, at this stage, theyare called “vessels”In order to receive God's Light, however, a Vessel must in some way be connectedto God. The basic difference between the spiritual and the physical is the fact thatspace does not exist in the spiritual realm. Hence, there is no way in which the Sefirotcan be physically connected to God. The only possible relationship is therefore"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"resemblance. In order to receive God's Light, the Vessel must, at least to some degree,resemble God.This, however, presents a difficulty. If God is the ultimate Giver, then the Vessel isthe ultimate receiver, and the two are then absolute opposites. In order for a Vessel toproperly receive, it must also give.What is therefore needed is a “vessel” that can give as well a receive. The ultimateexpression of such a vessel is man. If man is to receive God's light, he must firstresemble God by being a giver. This is accomplished through keeping God'scommandments, thus providing spiritual sustenance to the spiritual Universes. Beforeman can do this, however, he must also resemble God by having both free will and freechoice. This is only possible when both good and evil exist.The first stage of creation is called the Universe of Chaos (Tohu). This is a statewhere the Vessels, which were the primitive Ten Sefirot, could receive God's Light,but could neither give nor interact. Insofar as they did not resemble God, these Vesselswere incomplete, and therefore, they could not hold the Light. Since they could notfulfil their purpose, they were overwhelmed by the Light and “shattered.” This is theidea of the “Breaking of Vessels.”The original Vessels were in what is now the Universe of Atzilut. When they wereshattered, the broken pieces fell to a lower spiritual level, which became the Universeof Beriyah. It is at this level that evil begins to manifest, and its source is in thefragments of the Broken Vessels.The reason the Vessels were originally created without the ability to hold the Btghtwas that Evil should come into being. This in turn would give man freedom of choice,which, as we have seen, was necessary for the rectification of the Vessels.Furthermore, since Evil originated in the highest original Vessels, it can be rectifiedand re-elevated to this level.This “Breaking of Vessels” is alluded to in the Midrash, which states that “Godcreated universes and destroyed them.”24 It is also alluded to in the Torah, in theaccount of the Kings of Edom, at the end of Genesis 36. The death of each of theseKings is said to infer the shattering of a particular Vessel and its falling to a lowerlevel, such a fall being referred to as “death.”After having been shattered, the Vessels were then rectified and rebuilt into thePartzufim. Each of these Partzufim consists of 613 parts, paralleling the 613 parts ofthe body, as well as the 613 commandments of the Torah. These Partzufim were thenable to interact with each other. More important, they then resembled both man and theTorah. They were therefore able to interact with man through the Torah, and theytherefore become givers as well as receivers."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"In their rectified state as Partzufim, the Vessels are then adequate to receive God'sLight. In the Ari's terminology, this state is called the Universe of Rectification(Tikkun). He said that the other Kabbalists had only spoken of the Universe of Chaos,while he was the first to reveal the mysteries of the Partzufim, which are in theUniverse of Rectification. These Partzufim constantly interact with each other in ananthropormorphic manner. It is for this reason that the symbolism of sex, birth, andgrowth play such an important role in the Ari's system.The earlier Kabbalists spoke of four Universes, Atzilut, Beriyah, Yetzirah, andAsiyah, paralleling the four letters of the Tetragrammaton (see table). There were also"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"hints of a universe above these four, corresponding to the apex of the Yod in theTetragrammaton. The Ramak speaks of this fifth universe and calls it the Universe ofTzachtzachim (Splendors), but is hard-pressed to find any reference to it in theZohar.25The Ari, however, identified this fifth Universe as the realm of another mysteriousPartzuf mentioned in the Zohar—Adam Kadmon (First Man)—the primary Partzuf.Within this fifth Universe there are another four levels, again paralleling the fourletters of the Tetragrammaton. These are the four expansions of the Tetragrammaton,usually referred to by their numerical value: Ab ( = 72), Sag ( = 63), Mah ( = 45),and Ben ( = 52). (See Table).It is these four levels that ultimately manifest themselves in the four letters of theTetragrammaton, the four lower Partzufim of Atzilut, and ultimately, in the FourUniverses themselves. In written language, we again find these four levels, this timerepresented by the accent marks, the vowel points, the letter decorations (tagin), andby the letters themselves.3. KAVANOTAlthough the bulk of the Lurianic writings deal with the theoretical Kabbalah, histeachings were by no means confined to theory. An important meditative aspect of theAri's system involved Kavanot, which are specific meditations related to particularpractices. These can involve dressing, putting on the Tallit or Tefillin, or the variousholiday practices, such as eating Matzah on the Passover, or taking the Four Species onSuccot. Since a person was constantly involved in these religious observances, theKavanot would bring him to a meditative state throughout his daily activities.Particularly important is the formal prayer service, where each word has Kabbalisticsignificance, and is the focus of an entire system of meditations.Many Kavanot are discussed among the older Kabbalists, and most of these arebased on the Zohar, even though the Zoharic allusions are often very vague. But animportant part of the Ari's greatness was his ability to extract the fullest meaning fromeach word in the Zohar, and therefore, where the Zohar only hints, the Ari is able topresent a fully-structured meditation. For the most part, these Kavanot fit closely intothe Ari's theoretical system.To a large degree, these Kavanot bring a person into the upper Universes, andinvolve combinations of Divine Names and many gematriot (numerology). They filltwo large volumes, the Pri Etz Chaim (Fruit of the Tree of Life), and the ShaarHaKavanot (Gate of Kavanot), as well as several smaller texts. These Kavanot involvevirtually every aspect of life, both religious and mundane.To take only one of thousands of examples, we shall present here the Ari's system ofmeditations when immersing in the Mikvah (ritual pool) before the Sabbath. As we"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"have seen, such immersion played an important role in virtually all the meditativesystems, being an essential step in attaining spiritual purity.

[Just as water is gathered together in a Mikvah,] the expansions ofthe Name Ehyeh are gathered [into the above expansion].Now meditate on the word Nachal (), meaning stream.This supernal Stream consists of [seven Names], These are the four expansions ofthe Tetragrammaton, Ab, Sag, Mah, and Ben, together with the three expansions ofEhyeh, respectively with the Yud, the Heh, and the Alef. (Ehyeh is AHYH, ).Bring the Mikvah into this Stream.Meditate on these seven Names when they are not expanded:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Each of these contains a single Yod. Therefore, in the Seven Names, there are a totalof seven Yod's.These Seven Names are the mystery of the Seven Names of the Sabbath.This is the mystery of the seven letters AHYH YHV (), mentioned in theZohar.27You must meditate on the simple spelling of the Seven Names, which contain sevensimple Yod's.

This is the numerical value of] Mayim (), meaning Water.In this manner, you have brought Water into the Mikvah.Now meditate that all of this should be “in honor of the Sabbath” (LiKevod Shabbat, ).

[The original Seven Names, each having four letters,contain a total of 28 letters. Add this to the two letters of YaH, and] you have a total of30 letters.

YICHUDIMThe essence of the Ari's meditative system consists of Yichudim (Unifications),where one manipulates the letters of various names of God. The word itself indicates aunification, and in general, these meditations consist of unifying two or more names.Sometimes the names are intertwined and various vowel points are added. Since thevarious divine Names reflect spiritual forces, and these forces have their counterpartsin different parts of the human mind, these Yichudim can have powerful effects inintegrating the psyche. At times, this can also be extremely traumatic.As in the case of the Kavanot, many of these Yichudim are alluded to in the Zoharicliterature, but little or no indication is provided that these manipulations are actuallymeditative techniques. It took the genius and inspiration of the Ari to reveal explicitlyhow they should be used.The idea of unifying God's Name is a most ancient one. The Sh'ma, the declarationof faith, “Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One” (Deuteronomy 6:4), is"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"often spoken of as the “Unification of the Name.”29 As we have seen, the Zoharprovides a specific Yichud associated with this verse.30 On the verse, “[You shall]attach yourself to [God]” (Deuteronomy 30:20) an ancient Midrash states that this is a“Unification of the Name,” indicating that it is through such unification that one bindshimself to the Divine.31 Among the earlier Kabbalists, there are specific references toYichudim involving combinations of Divine Names, a clear example being in thewritings of Rabbi Isaac of Acco.32We have also seen how the Ramak advocates meditating on the various names ofGod, especially on the Tetragrammaton with different vowel points paralleling the TenSefirot. In the Ari's system, the Sefirot are no longer seen as independent entities, butas complex interacting Partzufim. His system of meditation therefore involvesmanipulating these names in a manner corresponding to these interactions on high.The exact method of depicting these Names is not discussed, but we have spoken ofthis in the previous chapter. The mind is completely emptied, and the letters are thenseen as huge solid bodies, completely filling the mind. Gematriot involving thenumerical value of letters also plays an important role.The Ari saw the method of Yichudim meditations as being most important to attaintrue enlightenment. Although other methods exist, the only one specified, if only byallusion, in the Zohar was that of Yichudim, and it was therefore the purest and mosteffective of them all. While other meditative systems involved the pronunciation ofDivine Names, the system of Yichudim was completely mental, and therefore did notinvolve the dangers inherent in actually pronouncing names.Still, Yichudim can produce very high meditative states and channel powerfulcurrents of spiritual energy. If improperly used, they can produce effects that are bothtraumatic and dangerous. Even someone as spiritually advanced as Rabbi Chaim Vitalwas often overwhelmed by these experiences.SOURCESThis happened in Tammuz, 5331 (August, 1571). I had asked my master (the Ari) toteach me a Yichud so that I should gain enlightenment. He replied that I was not ready.I continued to press him until he gave me a short Yichud, and I got up at midnight tomake use of it.I was immediately filled with emotion, and my entire body trembled. My headbecame heavy, my mind began to swim, and my mouth became crooked on one side. Iimmediately stopped meditating on that Yichud.In the morning, my master saw me, and he said, “Did I not warn you? If not for thefact that you are a reincarnation of Rabbi Akiba, you would have [become insane] likeBen Zoma. There would have been no way to help you.”He then touched my lips, making use of a Kavanah that he knew. He did this each"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"morning for three days, and I was healed.On the day before the New Moon in Elul (September), he said to me, “Now you areready.” He then [gave me a Yichud and] sent me to the cave of Abbaye [(278-3338), animportant sage of the Talmud].33On the day before the New Moon in Elul, 5331 (September, 1571), my master sentme to the cave of Abbaye and Rava. I fell on the grave of Abbaye, and meditated withthe Yichud involving the mouth and nose of Atika Kadisha (The Holy Ancient One).34I fell asleep, and when I woke up, I could see nothing. I then fell on Abbaye's graveonce again, and made use of another Yichud that I found in a manuscript actuallywritten by my master.35 This Yichud involved intertwining the letters YHVH () andAdonoy (), as is well known. When I did this, my thoughts became so confused thatI could not integrate them. I immediately stopped meditating on this coupling.It then appeared as if a voice in my mind was saying to me, “Return in you! Returnin you!” over and over, many times. I thought to myself, “These are the words thatAkavya ben Mehalelel said to his son.”36 Then I once again began meditating on thisjuxtaposition of letters, and I was able to complete the Yichud.It then appeared in my mind as if a voice was quoting to me the verse, “God willprovide Himself a sheep for the burnt offering my son” (Genesis 22:8). It seemed as ifthis voice was explaining the meaning of that verse. I had been worried that the firstYichud that I had used had not accomplished anything, and this voice was telling methat I had completed it successfully, and had benefitted from it. This was thesignificance of the verse, “God will provide Himself a sheep.”It then appeared in my mind as if this voice was explaining that this verse alluded tothe first Yichud that I had used. [This Yichud involved the names] YHVH () andEhyeh (), and the sum of these two names is 47. The initial letters of the verse,“God will provide Himself a sheep” (Elohim yireh lo ha-seh, ) [] addup to 46 [and adding an extra unit yields the same number 47].The initial letters of, “A sheep for a burnt offering my son” (Ha-seh le-olah b'ni, ) spell out Hevel () a Breath. This is the mystery of the supernal Breathupon which I had meditated.It also appeared as if the initial letters of “For Himself a sheep for a burn offering”(Lo ha-seh le-olah, ) spelled out the name Hillel (), [the leading sage ofthe First Century b.c.e]. I did not understand the meaning of this, however.All this I imagined in my mind. I then began to tremble and all my limbs shuddered.My hands vibrated toward each otehr, and my lips also vibrated in an unusual manner.They trembled very strongly and rapidly.It seemed as if a voice was sitting on my tongue, between my lips. Very rapidly itrepeated the words, “What does he say? What does he say?” These words wererepeated over a hundred times. I tried to force my lips not to vibrate, but I could not"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"stop them.Then I thought to inquire about wisdom. The voice literally exploded in my mouthand on my tongue, and over a hundred times it repeated, “The Wisdom! The Wisdom!”Then it began repeating over and over, “Wisdom and Science! Wisdom and Science!”Then the voice repeated the phrase, “Wisdom and Science are given to you,” and then,“Wisdom and Science are given to you from Heaven, like the knowledge of RabbiAkiba.” Then it said, “And more than Rabbi Akiba!” Then it said, “Like Rabbi Yebi theElder!” Finally the voice said, “Peace to you,” and then, “From heaven they wish youpeace.”All of his happened very quickly while I was wide awake. It was a wondrousphenomenon. I then fell on my face, prostrate on the vault of Abbaye.When I related this to my master, he told me that I had benefitted greatly because Ihad meditated on these two Yichudim in succession, since this was the properprocedure. The reason that I had not been answered after the first Yichud was that theyhad waited until I had finished them both.My master later told me that as I walked home that day, he had seen the soul ofBenaiah ben Yehoiada accompanying me. He explained that he did not share the samesoul-root with me, but that he reveals himself to everyone who completes a loftyYichud. This was what he did while he was alive, as we have discussed elsewhere.37Rabbi Chaim Vital.385. GATE OF THE HOLY SPIRITThe greatest portion of the Ari's teachings are included in a set of eight volumescalled the “Eight Gates.” These were written down by Rabbi Chaim Vital and redactedby his son, Samuel Vital.Of these “Gates,” the seventh is the one that explains the Ari's system of Yichudim.This is the Shaar Ruach HaKodesh (The Gate of the Holy Spirit). As discussed earlier,the term Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) is a general term for enlightenment andinspiration. It is this volume that describes the Yichudim taught by the Ari throughwhich Ruach HaKodesh could be attained.For the most part, the Yechudim presented in this book were not taught in generalterms, but were given to specific individuals. These were usually the Ari's disciples,most often Rabbi Chaim Vital himself. Besides the Yechudim themselves, a generalsystem of disciplines is presented and these must be fulfilled before one cansuccessfully use the Yechudim.Many of the Yichudim in this book are for specific purposes, such as therectification of sins, or for such esoteric rites as exorcism. In general their purpose wasto channel spiritual power toward specific ends. This is also true when one seeksenlightenment, since one is then channeling spiritual energy into oneself. The other"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"uses of Yichudim will not be presented here, since they are outside the scope of thisbook. Here, we will deal specifically with Yichudim designated specifically forenlightenment.A very interesting concept discussed here at length is that of the Maggid, the angelicspokesman that we have discussed previously. Here, we not only find a description of aMaggid, but also an explanation of the general framework in which it functions.Equally important is the idea of binding oneself to saints who lived in ancient times.It is for this reason that many Yichudim are best accomplished near the graves of suchsaints, as in the example cited in the previous section. The theory behind this isdiscussed at considerable length.Excerpts FromThe Gate of the Holy SpiritWe will begin by explaining the concept of Prophecy and Ruach HaKodesh and theirvarious levels.39When a person is righteous and pious, studying Torah and praying with Kavanah,this must certainly produce something substantial. As the Zohar states, even the soundof one banging a stick is not without effect.40 One's good practices are certainly notwithout effect, but result in the creation of angels nd holy spirits. These survive andendure, as mentioned in the Zohar.41 The Talmud likewise teaches, “Whoever does agood deed earns an Advocate.”42Both good and evil angels are created from a person's speech, depending on hiswords, as mentioned in the Tikkuney Zohar. When a person studies Torah, the wordsand breath that emanate from his mouth become a vehicle for the souls of the earlysaints. These can descend and teach that person mysteries, as discussed in the Zohar.43All of this, however, depends on one's intent. If a person studies Torah withoutulterior motive, then the angel created as a result of such study will be very holy andelevated, and can be trusted to speak the absolute truth. If one reads without error, theangel will also be without error and absolutely reliable.The same is true of the observance of a commandment. If it is done correctly, a veryholy angel is created... Whatever is lacking in one's observance, however, will also belacking in that angel.It is certain that the power of an angel created from the study of Torah is muchgreater than that created through an observance. But one should not discuss thesedetails at length.These angels are the Maggidim mentioned in a number of books. They revealthemselves to individuals, teaching them mysteries and informing them of futureevents. These are angels created from the individual's own observance and study of"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Torah.These angels are the Maggidim mentioned in a number of books. Most of the time,these Maggidim do not reveal themselves to the individual, but sometimes they do.This depends on the nature of the person's soul, as well as his deeds. There is no needto dwell upon this at length.Some Maggidim are absolutely true, these being created from torah and observancesdone with perfection. Other Maggidim occasionally speak falsely, mixing truth andfalsehood. The reason for this is that when there is some falseness or ulterior motive inan observance, the angel created from it consists of both good and evil. The goodaspect of such an angel speaks the truth, while the evil in it speaks falsehood.Some Maggidim are created from the Universe of Asiyah alone. These are createdthrough deeds involving action, done without Kavanah. Others are from the Universeof Yetzirah, created from the study of Torah. There are also Maggidim from theUniverse of Beriyah, and these are created from a person's meditations and thoughts,when he is involved in studying the Torah and observing the Commandments. In everyUniverse there are many different details, but there is no need to discuss this at length.My master (the Ari) gave a sign [through which one can recognize a properMaggid]. It must constantly speak the truth, motivate one to do good deeds, and not errin a single prediction. If it can explain the secrets and mysteries of the Torah, it iscertainly reliable. From its words, one can recognize its level.The mystery of Ruach HaKodesh is this: It is a voice sent from on high to speak to aprophet or to one worthy of Ruach HaKodesh. But such a voice is purely spiritual, andsuch a voice cannot enter the prophet's ear until it clothes itself in a physical voice.The physical voice in which it clothes itself is the voice of the prophet himself,when he is involved in prayer or Torah study. This voice clothes itself in his voice andis attached to it. It then enters the prophet's ear so that he can hear it. Without thephysical voice of the individual himself, this could not possibly take place.The explanation is as follows: First there is an earlier voice, from which the angel orholy spirit was created. This itself is the voice of prophecy. When this voice thencomes to reveal the prophecy, it must clothe itself in that individual's present physicalvoice. This must be a voice expressed by the individual at the very moment that he isexperiencing the prophecy.This is the mystery of the verse, “The spirit of God speaks in me, and His word is onmy tongue” (2 Samuel 23:2). The “spirit” and “word” are the original voice, createdthrough his deeds. This is now resting on his tongue. It is literally emanating from hismouth, expressed in his speech, and therefore, it literally speaks with his mouth.44 It isonly then that he can hear it. This involves many details.This can also occur in another manner. This supernal voice can clothe itself in thevoices of other saints, from earlier generations. The two voices then come together and"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"speak to the individual...It is impossible for the voice of such a saint to speak to the individual unless the twoshare the same soul root. Sometimes, however, it can also occur when the individualhas done some deed that is associated with that saint in particular....When the voice is clothed in the individual's own speech, this is certainly a muchhigher level than when it is clothed in the speech of another saint. When one needsanother saint, this is an indication that his own speech does not have the power toinduce prophecy.This explains the difference between Prophecy and Ruach HaKodesh. Prophecy isfrom the Male aspect, while Ruach HaKodesh is from the Female.. . .The lower soul (nefesh) is from the Universe of Asiyah, which is associated with thename Adonoy. One should therefore meditate on the name Adonoy () binding it tothe name YHVH () in the Universe of Asiyah. He should then bind this to the nameEhyeh () in the Universe of Asiyah.45He should then meditate on this, elevating the name Ehyeh of Asiyah, and binding itto Adonoy of Yetzirah. Adonoy of Yetzirah should then be bound to YHVH ofYetzirah.[One proceeds in this manner through the Universes of Yetzirah, Beriyah andAtzilut], step by step, until he reaches Ehyeh of Atzilut. He should then bind Ehyeh ofAtzilut to the very highest level, which is the Infinite Being (Ain Sof).46. . .There is another Yichud that you must constantly keep before your eyes. Meditateon the name Elohim (), with the letters spelled out, [and the Heh spelled] with aYod (), :This has a numerical value of 300. This is the same as the numerical value ofMTzPTz (), which is YHVH () transformed by the Atabash () cipher.Meditate that Malkhut-Kingship is called Elohim and includes thirteen attributes.These parallel the thirteen letters in the expansion of Elohim.The Thirteen Attributes are introduced with the Tetragrammaton (YHVH), as theyare spelled out, “YHVH, YHVH, a merciful and loving God . . .” (Exodus 34:6).47 The"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"letters YHVH are then transformed into MTzPTz ()48(These are the qualities that a person must cultivate in order to attain enlightenment.)49When a person prays, studies Torah, or observes a Commandment, he must be happyand joyful. He must have more pleasure than if he had reaped a great profit or hadfound a thousand gold coins. The Talmud thus teaches that the sage, Abbaye wasstanding before Rava and was very joyous because he had just put on Tefillin.50The Torah states [that the people were punished], “Because you did not serve theLord your God with joy and gladness of heart, because of the abundance of all things”(Deuteronomy 28:47).51 You must rejoice in serving God more than when you profitwith “the abundance of all” the money in the world.The trait of sadness is a very bad quality, especially for one who wishes to attainwisdom and Ruach HaKodesh. There is nothing that can prevent enlightenment morethan depression, even for those who are worthy. We find evidence for this from theverse, “And now bring a minstrel, and when the minstrel played, the hand of God cameupon him” (2 Kings 3:15). [The music was needed to dispel his sadness].52The same is true of anger, which can prevent enlightenment completely . . . Thesages thus teach, “If a person becomes angry, if he is a prophet, his prophecy is takenaway.”53. . .Very important is the study of Torah. My master, of blessed memory, told me thatone's main intent when studying Torah should be to bring enlightenment and thehighest holiness to himself. Depend on this.One must therefore concentrate on binding his soul to its highest root through theTorah and attaching it there. His intent should be that through this, the rectification ofthe Supernal Man should be completed. This was God's ultimate intent when Hecreated man and commanded him to study the Torah.There are other qualities that one must cultivate. These include humbleness,humility and the fear of sin. These three traits should be cultivated to the ultimatedegree.There are also traits that should be avoided to the ultimate degree. These includepride, anger, temper, frivolity, and malicious gossip. Even if one has good reason todisplay his temper, he should avoid it.One should also avoid idle chatter, although it is not as serious as the five thingsmentioned above. One should not display temper, even to members of his family.Keep the Sabbath in action and speech, with all its particulars. This is very helpfulfor enlightenment.Sit in the synagogue with awe and trembling. The special meditation for this is of"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"great help in attaining Ruach HaKodesh.54My master also taught that prime path of Ruach HaKodesh is through care andKavanah is the blessing over food. In this manner, one dispels the power of the Husks(Klipot) that have a hold on food and attaches themselves to the person who eats it.When a person recites a blessing over food with Kavanah, he removes these [evilspiritual] Husks. In this manner, an individual purifies his body, making it [spiritually]transparent, prepared to receive holiness. My master stressed this very much.It is also important to wake up at midnight and recite the 111th Psalm. Whilereciting this, one should meditate on the letters MNTzPKh (), as discussedelsewhere.55 This is very helpful for enlightenment. . . .When you wear Tefillin, meditate that the four parchments of the head-Tefillinparallel the four letters of the Tetragrammaton. . . .It is also important to have a set order of study each day and not miss it. This shouldinclude Bible, Mishnah, Talmud and the Kabbalah, together with the propermeditations, as discussed elsewhere.56 It is important to be very careful regarding this.My master also said that it is good for a person to live in a house with windows opento the heavens, so that he can always lift his eyes to the heavens and gaze at them. Hecan then meditate on the miracle of God's creation, as it is written, “When I look atYour heavens, the work of Your fingers . . .” (Psalms 8:4). The Zohar also says thisabout Nebuchadnezzar, who stated, “At the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar liftedmy eyes to heaven, [and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the MostHigh]” (Daniel 4:31).57 It is therefore good for a person to constantly gaze at theheavens. This is something that will bring him wisdom, holiness and fear of God.My master also told me that the root of all when it comes to enlightenment, is thestudy of Law (Halakhah). He gave me this reason:When a person delves deeply into a question of Law, he should meditate how theshell (Klipah) of a nut covers the kernel. The kernel is the concept of Holiness. TheShell consists of the questions that one has with regard to that question of Law. ThisShell surrounds the Law and does not permit the person to understand it.When he then resolves the question, he should have in mind that he is breaking thepower of that Shell, and removing it from the Holiness. The kernel, which is the Law,is then revealed.If a person does not study the Law, and thereby break the Shells, how can he come tothe kernel, which consists of the Wisdom of Kabbalah and the secrets of the Torah?One must therefore strive very much, studying and meditating in the above manner.I also heard that my master would always interpret each Law in six ways. Then hewould give it a seventh interpretation which would involve its hidden mystery. This isrelated to the myster of the six week days ahich precede the sventh, which is theSabbath. . . ."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Rabbi Jonathan Sagis also told me in the name of my master that nothing is moreimportant for a person who seeks enlightenment than immersion [in the Mikvah], sinceone must be pure at all times. However, I noticed that my master generally did notimmerse during the six winter months. He had a rupture and was subject to sickness,and his mother did not allow him to immerse. Of this I am certain. But as a result ofthis, he did not lose any enlightenment whatsoever. . . .Rabbi Abraham HaLevi [Berukhim] told me that my master once gave him adviceregarding enlightenment. He was told to avoid idle conversation, to rise at midnight,and to weep regarding his lack of knowledge. He was also instructed to go through theZohar, hesitating only to understand the text, but not probing it in depth. In thismanner, he was to cover forty or fifty pages a day, until he had gone through the entireZohar many times.I once asked my master why he was worthy of all this wisdom. He replied that hehad worked very hard at it. I countered, “The Ramak and I, Chaim, also worked veryhard.” He answered, “Yes, you worked very hard, more than anyone else in thisgeneration, but you did not work as hard as me.”On many occasions, he would stay up all night, pondering a single passage in theZohar. Sometimes he would spend an entire week meditating (hitboded) on a singleteaching of the Zohar. At such times, he would virtually go without sleep completely.Rabbi Samuel Uceda told me that he heard my master say that if a person does notengage in any mundane speech whatsoever for forty days, he will attain wisdom andenlightenment.I also heard from my master the mystery of “entrusting the soul.” This involves theascent of the soul at night in the mystery of, “Into Your hand I entrust my spirit”(Psalms 31:6).58 There is no question that if a person is a Tzadik (saint), and is perfectin all his deeds, then his soul will ascend on high each night. This stated explicitly inthe Zohar.59But even if a person is not perfect, there are some practices that have the specificpower to elevate his soul at night. One need not do them all; only one done properly issufficient. If one does this, then his soul will ascend on high for that night alone. Theonly time that this will fail is if he has some major [unrepented] sin, which preventshim from ascending. But we are only speaking about the individual who walks in theways of God and does not sin purposefully.There are six methods, and each one is sufficient by itself if done properly.The first method is that on that particular day, the individual should have perfectKavanah in his prayers. If he does this, then in the ‘Falling on the Face’ in the morningprayer, he will bring about the supernal coupling.60 This is the mystery of the verse,“Who shall ascend to God's mountain” (Psalms 24:3). The verse is speaking of theperson who can ascend at night to the Upper Garden of Eden, this being “God's"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Mountain.” The verse itself then replies, “He of clean hands and pure heart, who doesnot lift his soul in vain.” This is speaking of the person who “lifts his soul” through themystery of the Feminine Waters in the “Falling on the Face,” when he says [in thatprayer], “To You O God I lift my soul” (Psalms 25:1). The individual [who does thiswith Kavanah] does not “lift his soul in vain.” He is literally lifting his soul, andthrough this, bringing about the supernal coupling.Such an individual can certainly have his soul rise at night, ascending to “God'smountain, His holy place.” This is because he had brought about the supernal couplingbetween Jacob and Leah, which takes place each night after midnight. Then, throughthe mystery of the Feminine Waters, his soul also ascends to this place, as we haveexplained elsewhere.61The second method involves giving charity properly on that day. This means that heshould not know to whom he is giving, and the recipient should not know from whomhe is receiving it. It is also necessary that such charity be given to a proper individual,one who is truly in need and worthy of it.The third method involves wearing Tefillin the entire day. One must not take hismind off from them during this entire period. While wearing them, he should meditateon the “short meditation” for Tefillin, which we have presented elsewhere.62The fourth method involves “bringing merit to the guilty.” On that day, one shouldprevent a wicked person from committing some sin, and bring him to repent that onesin. Alternatively, he should speak to that person about repenting. This will bear fruitthat will be of great benefit.The fifth method involves concentrating and recalling every sin that one has donethe entire day. This should be done when the individual is lying in bed. All of his sinsshould be before his eyes, and he should repent them all. After saying the bedtimeSh'ma, he should also confess them verbally, as explained in our writings . . . the Zoharspeaks of individuals who use this method, calling them “masters of nightlyreckonings.”It is important not to omit even a single sin or fine point that one transgressed onthat particular day. When going to sleep, he should confess them all [before God] andnot forget even a single one. It appears that I heard from my master, however, that it isnot necessary to review all that one had done that day, since this would be an endlesstask. But one must strive to do so, setting his heart to remember all that he had donewrong that day. This is sufficient.. . .My master also taught me a meditation that can be used with [any observance, suchas] charity and prayer. [This involves meditating on the Tetragrammaton (YHVH, ),and] uniting te name YH (), which is separated from VH ().Before any observance, one should say, “[I am doing this] to unite the Name of the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Blessed Holy One (Male) and His Divine Presence (Female), with reverence and love,love and reverence, in the name of all Israel.”He should then meditate that he is combining the letters YH (), which representlove and reverence, with the letters VH (), which represent the Blessed Holy One (ZerAnpin, the Male) and His Divine Presence (Shekhinah, the Female).When a person gives charity, he takes in his hand a coin, which in Hebrew is aPerutah (). He should meditate on this word, and contemplate that the letters ofPerutah and PRaT VH ( a detail of VH) are the same.The root of all Judgments is the 288 Sparks [which fell from Atzilut to Beriyahwhen the Vessels were shattered].63 Add to this [a unit representing] the whole, andyou have 299, [the numerical value of PRaT ()].These Judgments themselves are in Malkhut-Kingship (the Female), which is thefinal Heh () of the Tetragrammaton. When a person binds this Heh to the Vav ()[which represents Zer Anpin, the Male], then these Judgments are ameliorated in everydetail (P'rat, ). This is accomplished through charity.When a person wishes to repent, it is good to read the 20th Psalm and meditate onthe mystical name YBK () that appears twice in this Psalm. The first such referenceis in the initial verse, “God will answer you in a day of trouble” (Ya'ankha YHVHB'Yom Tzara, ), were the initial letters [are YYBTz (). These] add up to[112, the numerical value] of YBK (). The second such reference is more explicit, inthe last verse of this Psalm, “[the King] will answer us in the day we call” (Ya'ane'nuB'Yom Kare'nu, ). Here the initial letters themselves spell out YBK ().64(Regarding the Practical Kabbalah.)65I once asked my master the reason why the Practical Kabbalah is forbidden in all thelater Kabbalistic texts. How did Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiba and the other sages of theHekhalot make use of fearsome Names to open their heartsHe replied that at that time, the ashes of the [Red] Heifer were available, throughwhich they could purify themselves of all defilement. Now, however, we are all defiledby the dead, and we do not have the ashes of the [Red] Heifer, which is the only meansof removing this defilement. It does not help when we purify ourselves from otherdefilement when that resulting from contact with the dead remains as it was. We aretherefore no longer permitted to make use of these Holy Names, and one who does socan be punished very severely.66Rabbi Eliahu di Vidas told me that he had also asked my master this question, “Howdid earlier generations make use of the Divine Names?” He replied that one my usethem if he can fulfil in himself the verse, “Maidens (Alamot) love you” (Song of Songs1:3). The Talmud says, do not read Almot (maidens), but Al mot (over death), [makingthe verse read, “The one over death loves you.”] This means that one must be so"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"righteous that he is even loved by the Angel of Death.67If a person does not have any sin, the Accuser cannot come before the Blessed HolyOne and say, “Behold this person is making use of Your Names, and on that day, hecommitted such a sin.”68 [When such an accusation is made] that person is punishedfrom heaven for making use of God's Names. But if he is totally without sin, then thereis no way in which he can be denounced. The Angel of Death [who is identified withthe Accuser] becomes his friend. Such a person can make use of Divine Names and notbe punished.This is alluded to in the Hekhalot, which states that one should not enter the Orchard(Pardes) unless he has never violated any negative commandment of the Torah.We also see a case when Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKana was meditating (hitboded) andgazing into the Orchard (Pardes). Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiba touched him withthe gown of a woman who was only questionably unclean, and he was dismissedimmediately from before the Throne of Glory.69We therefore see proof to both of my master's replies.On another occasion, this same [Rabbi Eliahu di Vidas] received a somewhatdifferent reply from my master. He said that the names and amulets that are now foundin various manuscripts all contain errors. Even names and amulets that have beentested and found effective are still full of errors. It is therefore forbidden to make useof them. If we knew the names correctly, however, then we would also be permitted touse them.[One who makes use of the Practical Kabbalah therefore blemishes his soul.] Hispenitence is to roll nine times in the snow. He must undress completely, and whiletotally nude, roll back and forth in the snow. This must be done nine times. [It shouldbe done in a totally secluded place.]This is alluded to in the verse, “When the Almighty is articulated, Kings are in her,[it will snow in deep shadows]” (Psalms 68:15). It is speaking of a person whoarticulates the Almighty's Names, which are called Kings. It is for this reason that theinitial letters of the words, “When the Almighty is articulated, Kings” (B'PareshShaddai M'lakhim, ), spell out BaShem (), meaning “with the Name.”When a person articulates such Divine Names and pronounces them with his lips,then he is punished in the Genihom of Snow. It is known that Gehinom has twochambers, one of snow, and the other of fire.70 The verse therefore concludes, “It willsnow in deep shadow,” indicating that this person will be condemned to the Gehinomof Snow. It is for this reason that his penitence must also be through snow.When a person makes use of Divine Names, he causes great evil for himself.[Through these Names,] he binds angels by an oath, coercing them to do his will.

Soetimes a soul will do this because it comes from thesame Root as the person who is meditating. At other times, it is because the individualdoes some good deed that pertains particularly to that saint. The saint then comes tohim through the mystery of Nativity (Ibbur, ).One such saint who reveals himself is Benaiah ben Yehoiada.72 He comesparticularly when one meditates with a Yichud that elevates the Feminine Waters,[which consists of spiritual energy that ascends from below].This is his mystery. There are many saints who meditated with Yichudim duringtheir lifetime, and they knew how to time this so that it would be accepted by theSupernal Will. At such times they would make use of Yichudim and transmit greatbenefit to themselves.Usually, when a person makes use of a Yichud, he can only do so through the aspectof his Soul Root. But if one uses the Yichud at an auspicious time, he can then bring allthe Supernal Roots together, and this is a very great advantage.In general, when a saint dies, he causes all the universes to unite. But there are saintswho knew how to use Yichudim at auspicious times, and they could do this even duringtheir lifetime. What other saints could accomplish only after death, they could dowhile they were still alive.One such saint was Benaiah ben Yehoiada. It is for this reason that he was called“son of a Living Man” (2 Samuel 23:20), even after his death. This indicates that evenwhen he was alive he was able to unify all universes. He was therefore said to be “fromKabtziel,” [which means “Gathering of God.”] This is because he gathered and unitedall universes.He was called Benaiahu () because of the Yichud through which he meditatedand elevated the Feminine Waters. His name can be read as Ben () and YHV (). Theletters YHV denote the Sefirah of Tiferet-Beauty (Zer Anpin, the Male), who givesRuach (spirit) to the Feminine Waters. The Feminine Waters themselves are calledBen, [which is the fourth expansion of the Tetragrammaton], when they are in theFemale [Partzuf]. It is for this reason that he is called Benaiah— Ben YHV.He is also called “Son of a Living Man” (Ben Ish Chai). “Ben” () denotes theTetragrammaton expanded with Heh's, which is called Ben (52). This Tetragrammatonis derived from the Sefirah of Yesod-Foundation, which is called Ish Chai (“A LivingMan,” or “A Man of Life”)."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"There were other saints who resembled him in this respect. They included Moses,Rabbi Hamnuna the Elder, Rabbi Yebi the Elder, and others like them.These saints were worthy of a very high level during their lifetime. Therefore, evenafter they died, whenever they see sages studying the Torah and meditating on higherYichudim, they join them and reveal themselves. Sometimes they are there, but theyremain concealed.Such saints can bind themselves to people even if they do not share the same SoulRoot. The reason is that they bound together all universes, and therefore include themall.These saints reveal the mysteries of the Torah to certain individuals. The generalconcept explains how Rabbi Hamnuna the Elder and Benaiah ben Yehoiada revealedthemselves to Rabbi Eliezer [son of Rabbi Shimon] and Rabbi Abba, as mentioned inthe Zohar. [It also explains why the Elder said,] “Whenever I find sages, I followthem.”73When the soul of a saint reveals himself to an individual who shares the same SoulRoot, then this individual gains very great enlightenment. Even though they can alsoreveal themselves to one who does not share their Soul Root, the influence is all thegreater when they do share it, since they are then rectified through his rectification.If a person begins meditating with a particular Yichud and then stops, he can causehimself great harm. “If he abandons it for one day, it will abandon him for two.”74 Thesouls that wish to bind themselves to him will then abandon him and repel him.Do not say that the study of Torah is greater, and it is not fitting to neglect it [inorder to meditate on Yichudim]. For the Yichudim that are mentioned here are moreimportant than the study of Torah. Through them one can unify the SupernalUniverses. This is considered to be a combination, including both Torah study andmeditation.Even if souls do not reveal themselves to you, do not be concerned, and do not stopmeditating. Your intent should not be to bring souls to yourself, but to rectify theSupernal Universes.Second IntroductionIt is very beneficial to meditate on a Yichud while lying prostrate on the grave of asaint. When you do so, contemplate that through your own position, you are causingthe saint to prostrate his soul and infuse the bones in his grave. This causes him tocome to life in a sense, since his bones become like a body for the soul that infusesthem. This soul is that which remains in the grave, this being the mystery of the verse,“His soul mourns for him” (Job 14:22). At this time, [as a result of your Yichud], it isas if both the body and soul of the saint were alive.If you are not on a grave, but meditate on Yichudim at home, you need not have this"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"intent. But at all times, whether on a grave or at home, it is beneficial to contemplatethat your soul and that of the saint are bound together, with your soul included in his,and that the two of them are ascending together.You should also meditate on the Root where your soul and that of the saint arebound to Adam. Contemplate on arousing that place, which is the limb where the saintis bound to Adam. As a result of that limb, you can elevate the saint's soul through themystery of Feminine Water.Thus, for example, imagine that the root of the saint is in the right arm of Adam, andthat you also share this same root. After the saint died, he ascended from the arm to thehead. Your soul, however, is still in the arm.Each and every such root is a complete Partzuf (human form). If, for example, yoursoul is derived from the heel of that Partzuf, contemplate that you are elevating it fromthe heel to the head. Your soul will then bind itself to that of the saint. The two soulstogether are then motivated, and you, too, can ascend through the mystery of theFeminine Waters.If you have reached the level of Neshamah, you should motivate your Neshamah toascend with that of the saint. If you have attained only Ruach, you should motivateonly your Ruach. The same is true if you have only the level of Nefesh. . . .The most important thing is that you must do this with powerful yearning and joy.Your soul should be completely divested from the physical.YICHUDIM75The First YichudThis is a Unification of Chochmah-Wisdom and Binah-Understanding.Meditate on the name YHVH () in Chokhmah-Wisdom.Then meditate on the name Ehyeh () in Binah-Understanding.Now bind the two names together, meditating on the combination, which is"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"YAHHVYHH (). This is the Upper Union.Then meditate on the Name that unites the two. This is Ab (72), the Tetragrammatonexpanded with Yod's:This expansion [has a numerical value of 72] the same as that of Chesed-Love ().This is the upper Chesed, which brings about the Higher Union. It is called Destiny(Mazla, ), and it is created through the Neshamah of the saint, when he ascends onhigh in Binah-Understanding. This involves the Feminine Waters of Binah-Understanding. It is the mystery of the statement, “Thus has it arisen in Thought,”76[since Thought is Binah-Understanding].Now meditate on YHVH () in Tiferet-Beauty. Then meditate on Adonoy () inMalchut-Kingship.Bind the two names together, and then meditate on the combination, which isYAHDVNHY (). [This is the Lower Union.]Then meditate on the Name that unites the two. [This is Mah (45),] theTetragrammaton expanded with Alef's:This is made through the Ruach of the saint. The Nefesh of the saint provides theFeminine Waters [for this Union].Thus, the Lower Union requires the Ruach and the Nefesh. The Ruach motivates theUnion, while the Nefesh provides the Feminine Waters.For the Upper Union, however, all that is required is Neshamah. This is becauseNeshamah also includes the Neshamah of the Neshamah [which is the Chayah]. TheNeshamah of the Neshamah, which is associated with Chokhmah-Wisdom motivatesthe Union. The Neshamah itself, which is associated with Binah-Understanding, is themystery of the Feminine Waters.It therefore resembles the Lower Union. In the Lower Union, Ruach, which isassociated with Tiferet-Beauty motivates the Union. The Nefesh, which is associatedwith Malkhut-Kingship then stimulates the Feminine Waters.There are four ways to expand the Tetragrammaton. It can be expanded with Yod's[to form Ab, having a numerical value of 72] like this:It can be expanded [to form Sag, which has a numerical value of 63] like this:"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"It can be expanded with Alef's [to form Mah, having a numerical value of 45] likethis:And it can be expanded with Heh's [to form Ben, having a numerical value of 52]like this:The Tetragrammaton expanded wth Yod's, adding up to 72 (Ab), motivates the unionof Chokhmah-Wisdom (Father) and Binah-Understanding (Mother), through theNeshamah of the Neshamah of the saint. It is associated with Chokhmah-Wisdom.The Tetragrammaton adding up to 63 (Sag) then elevates the Feminine Watersthrough the Neshamah of the saint. This is associated with Binah-Understanding.The Tetragrammaton adding up to 45 (Mah) then motivates the union betweenTiferet-Beauty (Male) and Malkhut-Kingship (Female) through the Ruach of the saint.[It is associated with Tiferet-Beauty (Zer Anpin)].The Tetragrammaton adding up to 52 (Ben) then elevates the Feminine Watersthrough the Nefesh of the saint. This is associated with Malkhut-Kingship (the FemalePartzuf).Review all of this carefully and understand it well.In short, place the four letters of the Tetragrammaton () before your eyes andmeditate on them. Contemplate that you are uniting the Blessed Holy One (Male) withHis Divine Presence (Female), this is the union of the letters Vav Heh () [of theTetragrammaton].

The same is true with regard to the Ruach and Nefesh.If you do this, you will be completely bound to the saint, and you will be worthy ofknowing all that you desire and receiving answers to all that you ask.This, however, requires great concentration. You must clear your mind of allthought, and divest your soul from your body. If you do not do this correctly, you canbe guilty of death, heaven forbid.If you are yourself worthy of Neshamah of Neshamah as well as the lower levels ofNeshamah, Ruach and Nefesh, then all four levels will be bound to those of the saint.You will then attain an extremely high level of enlightenment. If you have only thelower levels of the soul, your enlightenment will be correspondingly less. Throughyour devotion, you can increase your attachment and enlightenment. Through this, Godwill reveal to you the wonders of His Torah, and bring you close to Him in worship,love and reverence.The Zohar teaches that a saint's Nefesh remains in the grave, his Ruach is in theGarden of Eden, while his Neshamah is under the Throne of Glory. This, however, isonly speaking of a person whose Nefesh is from Asiyah, whose Ruach is fromYetzirah, and whose Neshamah is from Beriyah.There are saints, however, who are worthy that all three levels of their soul, Nefesh,Ruach and Neshamah, are all from Atzilut. In such a case, there is no question that his"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Nefesh ascends to Malkhut-Kingship [in Atzilut], his Ruach ascends to Tiferet-Beauty,and his Neshamah ascends to Binah-Understanding. This is because all things return totheir Root.The Nefesh that remains in the grave is therefore only the Nefesh of Asiyah.The Tikkuney Zohar states that the Tetragrammaton expanded as Sag is the mysteryof the Feminine Waters of Binah-Understanding. Through this, the Son (Zer Anpin)ascends upward to [the Partzuf of] Father.77The souls of saints are the Feminine Waters of Malkhut-Kingship [the FemalePartzuf]. In a similar manner, [Zer Anpin and the Female, which are] the Children ofBinah-Understanding (Mother), serve as Her Feminine Waters.Tiferet-Beauty (Zer Anpin) then ascends through the mystery of Daat-Knowledge tounite Chokhmah-Wisdom and Binah-Understanding through [Ab,] the Tetragrammatonexpanded with Yod's. Malkhut-Kingship then remains in the mystery of the FeminineWaters of Binah-Understanding, through the Tetragrammaton expanded as Sag.Understand this well.I copied all of this from an actual manuscript written by may master.78What follows was heard from him orally.The Third Yichud79The name Mah is the Tetragrammaton expanded with Alef's. When this is “squared”it has a numerical value of 130.This is the Mouth of Atika Kadisha (The Ancient Holy One). [Atika Kadisha is thePartzuf that parallels the upper part of Keter-Crown, and it is the highest Partzuf inAtzilut]"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"This is the mystery of the verse, “Who placed a Mouth in Man (Adam)” (Exodus4:11). The name Mah has a numerical value of 45, the same as that of Adam (),meaning “man.”The “square” of Mah is 130. Subtract from this 45, which is the numerical value ofMah itself. You then have 85, which is the numerical value of Peh (), meaning“mouth.” Therefore, if you add “muth” (85) to “man” (45), you have 130.This is the Outer Essence [of this Mouth].The Inner Essence of the Mouth, however, is the Tetragrammaton expanded as Sag.From our other teachings, you already know that there is a Union in the mouth itself.This involves the Throat, which gives rise to the letters AHChE (), and the Palate,which produces the letters GYKhK (). This then produces the other three phoneticgroups, making a total of 22 letters.The Inner Essence of the Nose of Atika Kadisha is the Tetragrammaton expanded asSAG.Its Outer Essence consists of the three names Ehyeh (). These emanate from thethree Alef's that are in the name Mah.The name Mah is in the mouth of Atika Kadisha, as mentioned above. The threeAlef's are transmitted upward and become the Outer Essence of the Nose.We can now write the Yichud in brief. This is how you should meditate:First meditate on the name Mah, the Tetragrammaton expanded with Alef's:This is the Mouth of Atika Kadisha.

THE BAAL SHEM TOVOf all mystical movements, none captured the popular imagination as did Hasidism.At its peak, this movement literally had millions of followers. Although much has beenwritten on Hasidism, its meditative aspects are usually ignored or missed. One reasonfor this is that this is a side that is not readily apparent unless one has explored theearlier methods of Kabbalah meditation. Actually, however, it was its meditativepractices more than anything else that gave Hasidism its great impetus, and drew intoits ranks many important Kabbalists.The Hasidic movement was founded in the mid 1700's by Rabbi Israel, known as theBaal Shem Tov (1698–1760). By the time the movement was fifty years old, itcommanded the allegiance of a majority of Eastern European Jewry, and Hasidicrabbis dominated many important communities. Many Kabbalah texts were printedunder the aegis of this movement, often for the first time. Important changes tookplace in community life, and entire countries changed their worship habits so as toconform to the Kabbalistic norm. Where Kabbalah had previously been the province ofonly the greatest scholars, it had now become part of the popular folklore, and even thesimplest individuals had become familiar with its terminology.This was a period when the theoretical Kabbalah had been on the ascendancy. TheRamak and others of his school had earlier succeeded in expressing the Kabbalah as atightly reasoned philosophy, and the Ari expanded this system, greatly enriching it. InEurope, such giants as Rabbi Joseph Ergas (1685–1730) and Rabbi Moshe ChaimLuzzatto (1707–1747) had lifted the Kabbalah to a level where it could compete withrival philosophical systems on their own logical ground. But with the greatconcentration on the theoretical and philosophical aspects of the Kabbalah, its mysticaland meditative aspects had virtually been forgotten. It was this gap that Haidism hadcome to rectify, and it did so with remarkable success.Even during the time of the Ramak and the Ari, the Kabbalah had already gainedconsiderable popularity in Europe. Besides sending a significant number of greatthinkers to the Holy Land, the expulsion from Spain had also greatly enriched Jewishlife in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Bohemia. While Rabbi Joseph Carohad written his Shulchan Arukh as the authoritative code of Jewish Law, his Europeancontemporaries, the Rama (Rabbi Moshe Israelish, 1520–1572) and the Maharshal"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"(Morenu HaRav Sh'lomo Luria, 1510–1573) had challenged him, and had eventuallywritten their own versions of the Code. It was around this time that community life inEastern Europe became strong, and such cities as Lublin, Cracow and Prague becameimportant centers of intellectual activity.At the same time, there were also a good number of important Kabbalists in EasternEurope. The Maharal of Prague (Rabbi Judah Liva, 1512–1609) write a number ofimportant books, largely based on the Kabbalah. For the most part, however, theMaharal's fame came from his creation of the legendary Golem (uhi). A Golem is asort of android, formed of clay and brought to life through the mysteries of the SeferYetzirah. The making of a Golem requires the channeling of intense spiritual energythrough powerful meditative techniques, that bear more than a superficial resemblanceto those of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia. In 1653, the Frankfort' Kabbalist, Rabbi NaftaliBacharach, had the courage to include the formula in a printed edition of one of hisKabbalistic books.1Another important Kabbalist of that period was Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz (1560–1630),who is frequently also cited as an authority on Jewish Law. He spent ten years of hislife in the Holy Land, where he became familiar with the teachings of the Ari and theSafed School. It is also possible that he was aware of the writings of Rabbi JosephTzayach. In his main work, Sh'nei Luchot HaB'rit (Two Tablets of the Covenant), wefind an important discussion of magic squares.2In 1594, Rabbi Matathias Delecreta, a native of Italy who was then living in Cracow,published an important commentary on Joseph Gikatalia's Shaarey Orah (Gates ofLight). His main disciple in Kabbalah was Rabbi Mordecai Jaffe (1530–1612), bestknown as the author of the Levush (“Garment”). This was also written as an alternativeto Caro's Code, and, while it did not supplant the Shulchan Arukh, it did become animportant standard source in Jewish Law. Rabbi Mordecai also wrote a majorcommentary on Kabbalistic exegesis of Rabbi Menachem Recanti (1223–1290).During this period in general, many important rabbis of major communities were alsowell-known Kabbalists. Most, however, dealt only with theory, and not with practice.Although very little is known of the origin of the Baal Shem Tov's system of Hasidicmeditation, there are traditions, particularly well-preserved by the Lubavitcherdynasty, that trace the history of the movement to this period.3 Although there hasbeen some question as to the authenticity of these traditions, and they have beengenerally ignored by historians, they do have enough historical consistency to meritserious consideration. Most important here is a tradition regarding the Nistarim, asecret society of Kabbalists. Even the existence of this society was totally unknown tooutsiders until it finally surfaced under the leadership of the Baal Shem Tov.According to this tradition, the Society of Nistarim (hidden ones) was founded in1621 or 1623, shortly after the death of Rabbi Chaim Vital. Its founder was Rabbi"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Eliahu of Chelm (1537–1653), known as Eliahu Baal Shem. He is know historically asthe great-grandfather of Chacham Zvi (1660–1718), who writes that his ancestor hadcreated a Golem.4 Eliahu Baal Shem was a contemporary and friend of the Maharal ofPrague, and it is possible that the two of them together were involved in the building ofthe Golem.Eliahu Baal Shem was born in Cracow to Rabbi Joseph Jospa, who had escapedSpain during the Expulsion of 1492. At the age of seven, he already had a reputation asa wonder child, and he would accompany his father to the study hall, drinking in thewords of the sages as they taught. Shortly after his Bar Mitzvah in 1550, his fatherdied, and he left home. He was not heard from again for forty years. Suddenly, in 1590,he emerged in Worms, where he rapidly gained a reputation as a miracle worker.From there, Rabbi Eliahu moved to Chelm in Eastern Poland, where he founded amajor academy. One of the most famed students was Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller(1579–1654), best known as the author of the Tosefot Yom Tov, who was also a discipleof the Maharal. Around 1624, Rabbi Eliahu moved to Prague, where he remained untilhe died in 1653, having lived for over 116 years.Leadership of the Society of Nistarim was then taken over by Rabbi Joel ofZamoshtch, another cryptic figure of the time, whose biography is also known onlyfrom this tradition. His father, Rabbi Israel Joseph, had been a disciple of RabbiMordecai Jaffe, discussed earlier. It was in 1613, a year after Rabbi Mordecai's deaththat Rabbi Joel was born. At a very young age, he was sent to study in the academy inBrisk, under his namesake, Rabbi Joel Sirkes (1561–1640), best known as the author ofthe Bet Chadash (“New House”). When he was twenty, his father sent him to EliahuBaal Shem's academy in Prague, where he became the leading disciple. When RabbiEliahu died in 1653, Rabbi Joel took over the leadership of the Society of Nistarim,and he remained its head for fifty years, until his own death in 1703. He made his seatin Zamoshtch, and is generally known as the Baal Shem of Zamoshtch.5The title Baal Shem literally means “master of the Name,” and in general, seems tohave been used for those who knew how to make use of Divine Names in the practicalKabbalah.6 In later times, however, this title seems to have been used particularly bythe leader of the Society of Nistarim, perhaps because they alone had the authority todecide when these Names could be used. All during this period, the activities of thisSociety were kept absolutely secret, and almost nothing is known of them, except forthe bits and pieces that have come down by tradition.The methods of these two Baal Shems would be equally cryptic if not for aremarkable little book, Toledot Adam (Generations of Adam), which is attributed tothem. Here we find all sorts of mystical remedies clearly influenced by the school thatproduced Shoshan Yesod Olam, discussed in Chapter Four. In Toledot Adam, use ismade of magic squares, discussed at length by Rabbi Joseph Tzayach, and it is here"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"that we find one of the few printed versions of the Seven Mystical Seals, discussedearlier in relations to Rabbi Isaac of Acco.7 One gets a distinct impression that, whilemost European Kabbalists were concerned with the theoretical aspects of theirdiscipline, this group was primarily engaged in its practical and meditative aspects.An important activity of the Society of Nistarim was to raise the status andeducational level of women. During this period, most Jewish women were not eventaught how to read. On the rare occasions that women came to the synagogue, theZagaka, an older woman who knew the service by heart, would lead them in worship.Members of the Society set up the first rudimentary educational system for girls, asystem that would eventually encompass most of Europe. The wives and daughters ofthe Nistarim were encouraged to study, and many became distinguished scholars andmystics in their own right.Under Rabbi Joel's leadership, the Society met some of its greatest challenges. Thefirst was the rise of the Cossack leader, Bogdan Chmielnitsky (1593–1657), who ledthe infamous massacres of 1648, where hundreds of Jewish communities in Polandwere annihilated. For a decade the Polish community was in complete ruins. Thosewho were not killed outright were driven from their homes, penniless. Libraries,accumulated over centuries, were put to the torch, and the treasures of the past weredestroyed without mercy. At a time when spiritual life was disintegrating, the Societyof Nistarim was very strongly involved in rebuilding the crushed communities ofEastern Europe.A second challenge threatened the very existence of the Society, since its enemiestook every opportunity to associate it with the false Messiah of Izmir. As a very youngman, Sabbatai Zvi (1626–1676) had become very deeply involved in the meditativeshools of Kabbalah, and it is speculated that he even came in contact with somedisciples of Elihu Baal Shem. It is well known that one of the dangers of meditationwithout proper training and supervision is that one can get illusions of power.Apparently this is what happened to Sabbatai Zvi. Reaching very high levels, he beganto speculate that he might be the promised Messiah, and during the Chmielnitskymassacres, he announced that he would be the one to redeem Israel.Sabbatai Zvi gave the impression of being on a very high spiritual level, and manypeople began to accept his claim. At first he hesitated, but finally, in 1654, heannounced that he was the promised one. He gathered followers from all over Europe,and in hundreds of synagogues, prayers were introduced on his behalf. The would-beMessiah had set his residence in Abydos, near Constantinople, and Sultan Mahomet IVfelt that he could be politically dangerous. In 1666, Sabbatai Zvi was imprisoned andgiven the choice of either converting to Islam or being put to death. Not willing toaccept martyrdom, he left the fold of Judaism. The result was shattering to the worldJewish community, and Sabbatai Zvi's name became a curse among his people.Still, many of Sabbatai Zvi's followers refused to believe that their leader had done"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"wrong, and they continued to believe in his mission. Mercilessly hounded by therabbinical leadership, these followers went underground, setting up a worldwidenetwork. A number of prominent rabbis were discovered to be closet members of thiscult.As a result, anything even remotely associated with Sabbatai Zvi became suspect.Since he was strongly involved in Kabbalah meditation, all those who made use ofthese techniques came under scrutiny. The Society of Nistarim were one of the mainschools that taught these methods, and was particularly vulnerable. The Society hadmany opponents, and they lost no time in associating the group with the False Messiah,claiming that he had been a disciple of Eliahu Baal Shem. In some cases, letters andcorrespondence was even forged, lending credence to these accusations. With many ofits members under dire suspicion and its very foundations under attack, the Societybegan to make its work all the more secretive.It was during this period that leadership of the Society passed to its most crypticmaster, Rabbi Adam Baal Shem of Ropshitz (1655–1734). Other than the traditions,there is absolutely no historic record of this individual, and his only public appearanceseems to have been in Slutzk in 1710.8 He left absolutely no writings, and because ofthis lack of direct evidence, some historians have even doubted his existence.Another reason for these doubts was that of his unusual name. Up until that time,there are no cases where Adam was used as a Jewish name, and some earlierauthorities had even forbidden its use.9 The same, however, was also true of the nameNoah, and we also find no use of this name until the middle 1600's. By the 1700's,Noah had become a fairly common name, and there is also evidence that the nameAdam was also in use.10There may well be an important reason for this. According to our best calculations,Adam Baal Shem was born in 1655, a year after Sabbatai Zvi had announced hisMessiahship, but over a decade before he was exposed as a fraud. Even among thosewho rejected Sabbatai Zvi, this was a period of new hope, where people saw therebuilding of Europe after the Chmielnitski massacres. If the Messiah had not arrived,he would not be far off. Anticipating a new age, people began to make use of suchnames as Adam and Noah, since both of these individuals saw the beginning of a newworld. In the case of Noah, the name has remained in use until today.This is in no way meant to imply that Rabbi Adam himself was ever in any wayassociated with the false Messiah. Quite to the contrary, as a young man, he was adisciple of Rabbi Solomon Samuel of Polotzk, a vigorous opponent of all mysticism.He kept an open mind, however, and was particularly impressed by Joel Baal Shem'sfamed exorcism, which took place in Posen in 1682.11 His curiosity grew, and finally,in 1688, at the age of 33, Adam visited Rabbi Joel to see for himself. He was soimpressed that he remained there in the academy for fifteen years, until Rabbi Joel's"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"death in 1703.Upon the death of Joel Baal Shem, leadership of the Society passed on to hisfavorite disciple, Rabbi Adam. At that time, however, it was not the only secret societyin existence. An important group that had gone underground were the followers ofSabbatai Zvi, who by this time had become very influential. Although the falseMessiah had become an apostate, they taught that his unfortunate experience wasnecessary in order to bring about the final true redemption. Although the ban ofexcommunication had been pronounced against the followers of Sabbatai Zvi a numberof times, the underground groups were still highly successful in attracting recruits. Thereligious leaders of the time therefore kept a very sharp eye open for any hint ofassociation with these heretic groups.This posed a grave danger for the Society of Nistarim. If their opponents could inany way associate them with the followers of the false Messiah, their effectivenesswould be destroyed completely. The only way in which they could avoid this, however,was to keep the very existence of their Society a closely guarded secret. Thus, duringhis period of leadership, Rabbi Adam Baal Shem allowed absolutely no publicitywhatsoever, neither with regard to himself, nor with regard to the Society's activities.Nothing was published in the name of Rabbi Adam, and his name itself was neveruttered outside the company of the elect.The Society was not to publicize its existence until it came under the leadership ofits last master, Rabbi Israel, usually referred to simply as The Baal Shem Tov. He hadbeen born on August 25,1698 (18 Elul, 5458) in Okop, a small village on the Polish-Russian border. Like many other small villages, it has been obliterated by time, or hashad its name changed — in any case, historians are hard-pressed to identify its exactlocation. Israel's parents, Eliezer and Sarah, were quite old when he was born, and theydied while he was still a very young child.Adopted by the synagogue, Israel was given the education common to Jewishcommunities at the time. He had a brilliant mind as well as a deep spiritual nature, butat an early age, he learned to keep his gifts a secret. He could not hide, however, fromthe true mystics, and he was contacted by the Society of Nistarim when he was tenyears old. By the time he was fourteen, Rabbi Adam sent his son to teach him andinitiate him into the mysteries of the Society. When he was eighteen, Rabbi Israel hadalready assumed a leadership role in the Society, but to all outward appearances, hewas nothing more than a simple synagogue caretaker.From Okap, Rabbi Israel moved to a town near Brody, where he was employed as ateacher of young children. He became acquainted with Rabbi Ephraim of Brody, who,almost inadvertently, became aware of the young man's unique gifts. Shortly before hisdeath, Rabbi Ephriam arranged the engagement of Rabbi Israel to his daughter Hannah.Rabbi Ephriam's son, Gershon of Kitov (1696–1760) was a leading rabbi in Poland,and was very much taken aback when Israel came to him, asking for his sister's hand in"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"marriage. Taking the young man to be an ignorant boor, Rabbi Gershon was about tothrow him out, when Israel produced a letter of engagement, signed by the girl's father.Although the famed scholar was very much against the match, he begrudginglyacquiesed, sending the couple away with a horse and wagon as a wedding present.Along with his bride, Rabbi Israel lived in a small mountain town between Kitovand Kasov in the Carpathean mountains. Supported by his wife, he spent his days andnights in study, worship, and meditation, coming home only on the Sabbath. Like theAri, he spent seven years in such secluded meditation, while at the same time studyinga set of mystical writings that had been entrusted to him by Adam Baal Shem.There has been considerable speculation as to the nature of these writings, but inpart at least, it is almost certain they consisted of Sefer HaTzoref (Book of the Smith),which had been written by Rabbi Heschel Tzoref (1623 —1700). Although there is nomention of him in the Society's traditions, it appears that Rabbi Heschel had been adisciple of Elihau and Joel Baal Shem, and was a leading figure among the Nistarim.He was known as a saint, working as a silversmith by day, while spending his nights inworship, meditation and Kabbalah study.Rabbi Heschel maintained that the Society should go above-ground and openlyrefute the accusions of its detractors. Emphasizing this point, in 1666, the year ofSabbatai Zvi's apostacy, he began to publicly teach Kabbalah in Vilna. From there, hemoved to Cracow, where his reputation as a saint grew. In the records of the burialsociety of Cracow, we find a note that states, “May God remember the soul of . . .Rabbi Joshua Heschel Tzoref, who knew how to blend (tzarefl the letters of the Torah.His soul left him with literal holiness and purity. He died as if by the Kiss [of God]on27lyar, 5460 (May 16, 1700),” His teachings are also quoted in Kar Ha Yashar (TheStraight Measure), one of the most popular devotional texts, first published in 1705.12Along with many mystics of that time, Tzoref was accused of having associationswith the followers of Sabbatai Zvi, and correspondence was even forged to prove theseallegations. Such witchhunts, however, were very common at the time, and everythingdealing with the Kabbalah was suspect. There is a manuscript of Abulafia's ChayayOlam HaBah (Life of the Future World) that attributes the authorship to Sabbatai Zvi,and his name also appears in an important manuscript of Shoshan Yesod Olam13 SinceRabbi Heschel's Sefer HaTzoref followed the methods of tzeruf advocated by Abulafia,it, too, became suspect.This Sefer HaTzoref still exists in manuscript, in the hands of the Karliner Hasidim.It is some 1400 pages long, and consists of revelations, like those of Rabbi Isaac ofAcco, as well as considerable word manipulation, reminiscent of Abulafia's methods.This manuscript has an interesting history. Upon the death of the Baal Shem Tov, itfound its way into the hands of his grandson, Rabbi Aaron of Tutiev. A copy was madeby Rabbi Isaiah Dinovitz, a disciple of the Mezricher Maggid, and it was eventuallygiven over to the Karliner dynasty."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"After ending his period, Rabbi Israel served for a while as teacher and ritual butcherin Koslowitz. In 1734, upon the death of Rabbi Adam, he was chosen by the Society tobe its new leader. Announcing to his brother-in-law, Rabbi Gershon, that the time hadcome for him to reveal himself, he settled in Talust, where his fame quickly spread.From there, he moved to Medzyboz, in the western Ukrain, where he remained until hisdeath in 1760.It was in Medzyboz that his teachings began to spread, and it was also here that hegained his main disciples. Attracting not only the common man, his disciples soonincluded some of the greatest minds of Eruope. Most important of these were RabbiDov Baer, the Mezricher Maggid (1704–1772), and Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonoye(1703–1794), the most faithful recorder of the Baal Shem Tov's teachings.It is well established that the Baal Shem Tov was highly involved in meditation andspiritual ascent. One of the most remarkable documents regarding this is an epistlewritten to his brother-in-law, Rabbi Gershon, who was then in the Holy Land. While itdoes not describe his methods, it does provide a good idea of the type of spirituallevels reached by the Baal Shem Tov.The Epistle14On Rosh HaShanah 5507 (September 15,1746), I made an oath and elevated my soulin the manner known to you. I saw things that I had never before witnessed since theday I was born. The things that I learned and saw there could not be communicated,even if I would be able to speak to you in person.When I returned to the lower Garden of Eden, I saw innumerable souls, both livingand dead, some whom I knew and others whom I did not. They were fleeting back andforth, going from one universe to another through the Column that is known to thosewho delve in mysteries. They were in a state of joy that was so great that the lipscannot express it, and the physical ear is too gross to hear about it.There were also many wicked people who were repenting, and their sins wereforgiven since this was a special time of grace. Even to my eyes it was wondrous howmany were accepted as penitents, many of whom you know. There was great joyamong them, too, and they also ascended in the above-mentioned manner.All of them beseeched and petitioned me unceasingly: “Go higher with the glory ofyour Torah. May God grant you greater understanding to perceive and know thesethings. Ascend with us, so that you can be our help and support.”Because of the great joy that I saw among them, I decided to ascend with them. Dueto the great danger involved in ascending to the supernal Universes, I asked my Masterto come with me.15 From the time that I began, I had never before ascended to such ahigh level.Step by step I ascended until I entered the chamber of the Messiah. There the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Messiah studies Torah with all the sages and saints, as well as with the SevenShepherds.16I saw great joy there, but I did not know the reason for it. At first I thought that thereason for this joy was that I had passed away from the physical world, heaven forbid.Later, they told me that I had not died, since they have great pleasure on high when Ibring about Unifications through the holy Torah down below. But to this very day, I donot know the reason for that joy.I spoke to the Messiah himself and asked him, “When is your majesty coming?”He replied, “This shall be your sign. It will be at a time when your teachings becomewidespread in the world, and ‘your springs overflow abroad.’17“It will be when the things which I have taught you, and which you have yourselfperceived, become known, so that others can also bring about Unifications and elevatethemselves like you do. All the Husks will then be annihilated, and it will be a time ofgrace and salvation.”I was very surprised, and distressed, since it would take a long time for this to bepossible. But when I was there, I learned three specific remedies and three holy Names,and they are easy to learn and explain. My mind was then set at ease, and I realizedthat it would be possible for people in my generation to reach the same level and stateas I did. They would then be able to ascend, learn and perceive, just like myself.All during my lifetime, I was not granted permission to reveal this. For your sake, Imade a request that I might be allowed to teach this to you, but permission was denied.I am still bound by this oath, but this I can tell you, and let God be your help:Let your path be toward God.18When you pray and study let [my words] not forsake you.19 With every word andexpression that leaves your lips, have in mind to bring about a Unification. Everysingle letter contains universes, souls and godliness, and as they ascend, one becomesbound to the other and they become unified. The letters then become unified andattached to form a word. They are then actually unified with the Divine Essence, and inall these aspects, your soul is included with them.All universes are then unified as one, and immeasurable joy and delight results.Consider the joy of a bridegroom and bride in this lowly physical world, and you willunderstand how great is this delight.God will certainly help you. Wherever you turn you will succeed and prosper. “Givewisdom to the wise, and he will become still wiser.”202. MEDITATIONAn important part of the Baal Shem Tov's teachings involved Hitbodedutmeditation. This was an integral part of his personal life as well, and it is reported that,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"as a young child, he would miss his lessons, going off to meditate (hitboded) in theforests.21 During his seven years of seclusion, he would meditate in the mountains, aswell as ain a special cave.22 When he studied together with the son of Rabbi Adam, hedid so in a special “Meditation Room” (Bet Hitbodedut), and it was in this room thatthey engaged in meditation in an attempt to commune with the Angel of the Torah.23Later, when he was a famed leader, he would also spend much time in such a“Meditation Room.”24Most of the Baal Shem Tov's general teachings regarding meditation are found inthe writings of his greatest disciple, Rabbi Dov Baer, the Mezricher Maggid. A few ofthese are also included in the Baal Shem's ethical will.SOURCESIn our generations, we have limited intelligence and must strengthen our love andreverence of God.In your mind, you must therefore constantly meditate (hitboded) on the love andreverence of God. Even when you are studying, it is good to pause occasionally and tomeditate in your mind. This is true even though it may take time from your sacredstudies.25In your mind, constantly meditate (hitboded) on the Divine Presence. Have no otherthought in your mind other than your love, seeking that [the Divine Presence] shouldbind itself to you. Constantly repeat in your mind, “When will I be worthy for theLight of the Divine Presence to dwell with me.”26You can lie in bed and appear to be sleeping, but at that time, you can actually bemeditating (hitboded) upon God.27When you wish to enter a [high] state of meditation (hitbodedut), you should havesomeone else with you. When a person does this while alone, he can be in great danger.Two people should therefore be together, and one should meditate, [mentally secluded]with his Creator.283. A YICHUDVery important in the Baal Shem Tov's meditative methods were the system ofYichudim as taught by the Ari. Besides these, the Baal Shem also had his own systemof Yichudim, but very little of this has been preserved. In other cases, the Baal ShemTov made use of the Ari's Methods, but greatly expanded upon them.One of the very few samples of the Baal Shem's Yichudim that are known involve ameditation for the Mikvah. We have quoted the Ari's Kavanah for immersion earlier,and it is instructive to compare it to the meditation of the founder of Hasidism."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"A Yichud for Immersion29When you enter the Mikvah meditate on the name KNA ().

Everything is then transformed into pure love and mercy.4. STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSAlthough the earlier meditative Kabbalists occasionally discuss their experiences,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"they provide very little theory regarding states of consciousness. One of the first tospeak specifically of states of consciousness appears to be the Baal Shem Tov.The two states of consciousness that he discusses are Mochin DeGadlut and MochinDeKatnut, or more commonly, simply Gadlut and Katnut.These terms are somewhat difficult to translate. The word Mochin literally means“brains,” and in the Ari's terminology, refers to “mentalities.” In the context used bythe Baal Shem, however, the term Mochin actually should be translated, “states ofconsciousness.”Gadlut means “maturity” or “greatness,” while Katnut means “immaturity” or“smallness.” Actually, then, the best way to translate Mochin DeGadlut would be“expanded consciousness,” while Mochin DeKatnut would be “constrictedconsciousness.” Within the general theory of meditation, it is known that an importantgoal of this practice is to bring a person to a state of expanded consciousness.These are actually borrowed terms. When the Ari speaks of the Partzuf of ZerAnpin, he expands upon its development which is outlined in the most mysteriousZoharic texts, the Greater and Lesser Idras. In its development, the Partzuf of ZerAnpin goes through stages of birth and growth. Like a human being, this Partzuf canthus be in a state of immaturity, as well as one of maturity. The immature state iscalled Katnut, while that of maturity is called Gadlut.As the Partzuf matures, so does its mentalities. It is in this context that we find theterms Mochin DeKatnut and Mochin DeGadlut, in their original meaning. MochinDeKatnut denotes the immature mentalities of Zer Anpin, while Mochin DeGadlutdenotes the mature mentalities.This anthropomorphism is to be taken symbolically rather than literally, and thestates of immaturity and maturity do not exist in different time spans. Both states existat all times, and are responsible for different effects in the lower world. The Ariexpresses it in this manner:30The power of forgetfulness in man is a result of these Immature Mentalities(Mochin DeKatnut).One must transmit Mature Mentalities (Mochin DeGadlut) [to Zer Anpin].When this is accomplished through one's deeds, he causes [the ImmatureMentalities] to descend to [the Female Partzuf. The Immature Mentalities whichare derived from the name] Elohim is thus expelled and removed completelyfrom Zer Anpin.If a person can do this, he will then have a wondrous memory, and willcomprehend all the mysteries of the Torah.Since Zer Anpin is the “Supernal Man,” everything in this Partzuf also has acounterpart in man. The Baal Shem Tov therefore taught that these states of"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"immaturity and maturity in Zer Anpin parallel different states of consciousness in thehuman mind.31 In man these are the states of expanded and constricted consciousness.When a person is in a state of expanded consciousness, he is enlightened in all walksof life. He has realized the vanity of the mundane world and the greatness of thespiritual. Everything that he does is with a different awareness, whether it is eating anddrinking, worship or study. The idea is discussed often in the teachings of the BaalShem Tov.SOURCESExpanded and Constricted Consciousness can be explained in the following manner.When a person learns something, but does not understand it in depth, this is a state ofConstricted Consciousness, since his mental picture is not complete. But when hegrasps something with enthusiasm and full understanding, then he is on the level ofExpanded Consciousness, bound to the highest levels.Similarly, there are states of Expanded and Constricted Consciousness in prayer andall other observance.32When a person is in a state of Exanded Consciousness, he has great joy in the studyof Torah and worship of God.33When a person is in a state of Constricted Consciousness, he cannot worship withreverence and love, but must force himself to do so, without joy. This state is themystery of Constricted Consciousness.34When a person follows his desires and the ways of his heart, then he is in a state ofConstricted Consciousness. This is the mystery of the verse, “I have made you small(constricted) among nations, you are very despised” (Obadiah 1:5).Expanded Consciousness is when one involves himself in the great mysteries of theFuture World and despises all worldly things.35Even when a person falls from his level, he should try to remain attached to Godwith a small thought. For sometimes there is a level of Constricted Consciousness onhigh, even in Zer Anpin. But through this Constricted Consciousness, one can attainExpanded Consciousness.This is like a coal. If even a small spark remains, one can fan it into a.large flame.But when the spark is extinguished, fanning no longer helps. Similarly, if one does notremain attached [on high] at all times, at least with a small thought, [the fire in] hisdivine soul can be completely extinguished.Sometimes the holy spark of the Divine Presence in a person's soul expands until itcan literally place words in his mouth. He does not speak voluntarily, but words areautomatically expressed from his mouth. This is a very high level.This phenomenon, however, can also come from the Other Side. When this occurs,"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"the person becomes insane.36Sometimes you can only worship with Constricted Consciousness. Then you do notenter into the supernal worlds at all. Still, you can realize that God is close and that“the whole earth is filled with His glory” (Isaiah 6:3).At such a time, you are like a small child, whose intellect has just begun to develop.But even though you are worshipping while in a state of Constricted Consciousness,you can still worship with great ttachment.Even though you are in a state of Constricted Consciousness, if you bind yourselfclosely to the Divine Presence you can instantly transport your thoughts to a supernaluniverse. You are then actually in that supernal universe, since a person is where histhoughts are. If you were not in that supernal universe, then your thoughts would alsonot be there.37Man consists of matter and form, body and soul.The soul constantly has a burning desire to attach itself to God. It is enveloped by aphysical [body] however, which acts as a barrier to such attachment.Man's physical self desires such material things as sex and food. These things,however, are also required on high, in order to accomplish such things as theseparation [and elevation] of the [holy] Sparks.There are certain times, however, when form can totally overwhelm matter, andattach itself to God.This is the mystery of, “The Living Angels (Chayot) ran and returned” (Ezekiel1:14).There are two levels, Expanded Consciousness and Constricted Consciousness.[“Running” denotes the state of Expanded Consciousness, while “returning” refers tothat of Constricted Consciousness.]I heard from my master [the Baal Shem Tov] that this is the mystery of theConstriction, which was “from Him and in Him.”38"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Rabbi Shalom Sharabi's Kavanot on the First Word of the Amidah5. THE WAY OF PRAYEROne of the Baal Shem Tov's most important accomplishments was to reveal a safemethod of meditation, which could be used by even the simplest person. Earliermethods involved Divine Names and could release potentially dangerous spiritualforces. The Way of Prayer, as taught by the Baal Shem Tov, involved nothing morethan the regular prayer service, uttered three times daily by every Jew."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The focal point of the prayer service is the Amidah or Shemonah Esreh, a collectionof eighteen (or nineteen) blessings, which is repeated three times each day. This prayerwas composed by the Great Assembly just before the close of the prophetic period.There is considerable discussion as to why a single prayer was prescribed to berepeated over and over each day. There is considerable evidence, however, that theentire Amidah was meant to be used as a meditative device, very much like a longmantra.After a person has repeated the Amidah every day for a few years, he knows thewords so well that they become an integral part of his makeup. It takes no mentaleffort on his part to recite the words, and thus, it is not very different than repeating asingle word or phrase over and over. If a person clears his mind of all other thoughts,then simply repeating the Amidah can produce a very high mental state. This is borneout in practice. The same is true of other parts of the prayer service that are reciteddaily.In an important teaching, the Talmud states, “One who prays must direct his eyesdownward, and his heart on high.”39 One of the important early commentaries, RabbiJonah Gerondi (1196–1263), explains that, “this means that in one's heart he shouldimagine that he is standing in heaven. He must banish from his heart all worldlydelights and bodily enjoyments. The early sages taught that if one wishes to have trueKavanah, he must divest his body from his soul.”40A few decades later, this very same concept was pressed even more explicitly byRabbi Jacob ben Asher (1270–1343). In his Tur, a major early code of Jewish Law, hewrites:It is taught that when one prays, he must concentrate his heart . . . This meansthat one must concentrate fully on the words that are expressed with his lips.One must have in mind that the Divine Presence is before him, as it is written, “Ihave placed God before me at all times” (Psalms 16:8).One must arouse his concentration and banish all disturbing thoughts, so thathis thoughts and intentions in prayer should be pure. . . .This was the practice of the saints and men of deed. They would meditate(hitboded) and concentrate in their prayers until they reached a level where theydivested themselves from the physical. The transcendental spirit would bestrengthened in them until they would reach a level close to that of prophecy.41It is significant to note that this passage is quoted verbatim by Rabbi Joseph Caro inhis Shulchan Arukh, and is also mentioned in the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov.42The idea of using the prayer service as a meditative device did not originate with theBaal Shem. Many of the older Kabbalists speak of the importance of concentrating inprayer, and many devised extensive Kavanot associated with the various parts of the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"service. This plays a particularly important role in the Ari's system, and many prayerbooks incorporate the Kavanot that he devised.This system of Kavanot reached its zenith among the Sefardic Jews under theleadership of the renowned Kabbalist, Rabbi Shalom Sharabi (1702–1777). He devisedelaborate charts, looking almost like mandalas for many key words in the prayerservice, greatly expanding upon the Ari's system. His methods are still used bymembers of the Bet El Academy in Jerusalem, who often spend as much as four hoursin the daily morning service.Much simpler than this was the method of the Baal Shem Tov. It could be used byanyone, from the greatest Kabbalist to the simplest individual. Rather than concentrateon the various Kabbalistic concepts during prayer, one must use the prayer itself as amantra, focusing his entire mind on the words. While praying, one then rises mentallyfrom one universe to the next, from chamber to chamber, until he reaches the highestlevel. Although this system is not presented in any one place, it is discussed at length,both in his own teachings, and in those of his disciples.When you pray, you should be totally divorced from the physical, not aware of yourexistence in the world at all. Then, when you reach the level where you are notcognizant whether or not you are in the physical world, you should certainly not haveany fear of extraneous thoughts. When you are divested from the physical, extraneousthoughts cannot come to you.43When you want to pray, it should be with awe. This is the gate through which oneenters before God.Say to yourself, “To whom do I wish to bind myself? To the One who created allworlds with His word, who gives them existence and sustains them.” Think about Hisloftiness and greatness and you will then be able to enter the supernal worlds.44Attachment means that when you say a word, you draw it out and do not want to letit go. Because of your attachment to each word, you draw it out.If you have extraneous thoughts when you worship, then the Husks are riding on"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"your words. For thought rides upon each word. . . .45Do not pray for your own needs, for your prayer will then not be accepted. But whenyou want to pray, do so for the heaviness of the Head. For whatever you lack, theDivine Presence also lacks.This is because man is a “portion of God from on high.” Whatever any part lacksalso exists in the Whole, and the Whole feels the lack of the part. You should thereforepray for the needs of the Whole.46Place all your thoughts into the power of your words, until you see the light of thewords. You can then see how one word shines into another, and how many lights arebrought forth in their midst.This is the meaning of the verse, “Light is sown to the righteous, and joy to theupright in heart” (Psalms 97:11).The lights in the letters are God's chambers, into which He transmits Hisemanations.47Separate your soul from your body. Your soul can then be clothed in the thought thatis contained in the words that you pronounce. You will then be able to perceive manyuniverses on high.You have many powers, one required for one universe, and another for the next.When your soul ascends to all the worlds that you must elevate, it is examined in eachuniverse to see if it is fit to go higher. If it is not, it is cast outside.When an extraneous thought comes to you, this is a sign that you are being cast out.But if you are wise, you can use that thought itself to bind yourself to God all the more.The thought consists of letters that are part of the Divine Presence's body, but they fellas a result of the Breaking [of Vessels]. The combination of these letters thereforebecomes bad, intermingled with the Husks.This is like sweetmeats intermingled with other things. Each thing is good by itself,but mixed together they are vile and disgusting. This likewise becomes evil.But when you understand the idea of the thought [that falls into your mind, you canthen elevate it]. If it involves desire and lust, it has fallen from the Universe of Love, ifit is a debilitating phobia, it is from the Universe of Fear, and if it involves pride, it isfrom the Universe of Beauty. The same is true of all other such thoughts, since [theattributes paralleling] all seven days of creation have fallen.When you bind these thoughts to God through love and fear of the Creator, you thenreturn them to their Root. The same is true of other attributes, and each thought can beelevated to the Attribute from which it fell. You can once again bind it to thatAttribute, and transform the Husks that fell from it into a good combination. . . .God has great delight when you do this. It is like a royal prince who is kidnapped.The king has great delight when he is returned, even more than from a son who hasnever left his side.48"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"It is actually very surprising that a mortal human being should be able to attachhimself to God. Besides his physical body, many Husks separate him from God. Eventhough, “the whole earth is filled with His glory,” God is still hidden behind manybarriers.But all the barriers that separate and restrain can be torn down by the word that youutter. Your words should therefore be attached to God. This means that you mustintimately feel that you are actually speaking to God.If we could speak just one line, or even two or three words, to God in each service,in the above-mentioned manner, it would be sufficient.49The reason why both love and fear are required is this. If a person only had love forGod, he would grow accustomed to be with God, and this would become part of hisnature. But as a result of his fear, he does not dare to come too close.50The Talmud speaks of “things that stand in the highest places of the universe, andare taken lightly by people.”51The Baal Shem Tov explained that the results of prayer are often manifest in the“highest places of the universe,” and not in the physical world. It is for this reason thatprayer is “taken lightly by people,” since they think that their prayer is in vain.The truth, however, is that all prayer has an effect.52Our main link to God is through words — words of Torah and prayer.Every single letter [in these words] has an inner spiritual essence. You must attachyour thought and innermost being to this essence.This is the mystery of, “Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth” (Song ofSongs 1:2)—the attachment of spirit to spirit.53 It is also the mystery of, “If you liebetween the lips” (Psalms 68:14)54When you draw out a word, and do not want to let it go, then you are in such a stateof attachment.55Every word is a complete concept, and you must place all of your strength into it. Ifyou do not, then it remains incomplete.56You can sometimes pray very fast. This is because the love of God is burning inyour heart very strongly. The words then leave your mouth of their own accord whenyou pray silently.When you attach yourself on high, you can be worthy of being lifted still further bythe very same prayer. Our sages thus teach us, “When one comes to purify himself, heis helped from on high.”57 Through prayer, you can attach your thoughts on high. Fromthe power of such prayer, you can then reach even higher levels. Then, even when youare not praying, you can be attached to the spiritual.58Sometimes you must worship in thought, with your soul alone.Sometimes you can pray with love and awe and with great intensity without moving"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"at all. Another person looking on can think that you are merely reciting the wordswithout any feeling. For when you are very closely bound to God, you can serve Himwith great love, with the soul alone.This is the best type of worship. It moves quickly, and can bring you closer [to God]than prayer whose intensity is visible outside through your body. Such prayer is allinside, and therefore, the Husks cannot grasp on to it.59Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov said that a person can read the Torah and see lights onthe letters, even though he does not understand it fully. Since he is reading with greatlove and enthusiasm, God does not pay attention to the fact that he may not be readingcorrectly.This is very much like a child who is very much loved by his parents. Even though itcannot speak well, its parents have great enjoyment when it asks for something.The same is true when a person recites words of Torah with love [and devotion].God has great delight, and does not pay attention to the fact that he does not read itcorrectly.60When you want to pray to God for something, think of your soul as part of theDivine Presence, like a raindrop in the sea. Then pray for the needs of the DivinePresence.You can have faith that your prayer will benefit the Divine Presence. Then, if youare properly attached to the Divine Presence, this influence will also be transmitted toyou.When a person is happy, he unconsciously claps his hands. This is because his joyspreads through his entire body.The same is true of the Divine Presence. Each influence is transmitted to each of itsparts.61There are times when you feel that you cannot pray. Do not give up even trying thatday. Instead, strengthen yourself all the more, and arouse your awe of God.This is very much like a king in battle, who must disguise himself [so as not to berecognized by the enemy]. Those who are wise are able to recognize the king by hismotions. Those who are less wise can still recognize the king, since he is alwayssurrounded by extra guards.The same is true when you cannot pray with devotion. You should know that theKing is there and you are encountering his additional Guards. The only reason why youcannot come close to the King is because of this great protection surrounding Him.You must therefore fortify yourself with reverence, great strength, and additionalintensity in order [to break through this barrier] and come close to God. If you aresuccessful, you will then be able to pray with the greatest possible feeling.62It is found in the writings of the Ari that the concept of one day's prayers is not thesame as that of the next day. [The concept of our daily service therefore changes every"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"day] until the arrival of the Messianic Age. Our sages therefore say, “If one's prayersare fixed, this is not a supplication.”63I heard from my master [the Baal Shem Tov] that this can be proven through theextraneous thoughts that enter one's mind during worship. These thoughts come fromthe Broken Vessels, and the 288 Sparks that one must separate each day.64[These extraneous thoughts enter one's mind during prayer in order that] he rectifyand elevate them.The extraneous thoughts of one day, however, are not at all the same as those of thenext. This evidence should be obvious to one who considers it.65When extraneous thoughts come to you during study or prayer, you should breakthese thoughts down and attach yourself to God. In this manner, you can rectify theHoly Spark that is in each particular thought.This is like a person who is counting money while his children are being held forransom. They come to him and say, “You have money! Ransom us!”66We are taught, “When one comes to purify himself, he is helped from on high.”67This is somewhat difficult to understand, for it does not seem to apply to all whowant to purify themselves.Sometimes you may want to pray with great enthusiasm before God. You makemany preparations [so your prayers should be just right]. Still, when you are in thedepths of prayer, you are disturbed by extraneous thoughts.You may then wonder, where is this help from on high? You have made everypossible preparation, cleansing your thoughts so that you should pray in purity. [Whythen are you disturbed by these extraneous thoughts?]Actually, however, this itself is God's help. . . . God sends you these thoughts inorder that you should elevate them. . . . These thoughts do not come by chance, but inorder that you should elevate them to their Root.Thus, for example, you may have an extraneous thought involving some evil love orfear. You must then push aside this thought and attach yourself to the love and fear ofGod, completing your prayers with great enthusiasm. You can then elevate the Spark[of holiness] out of the Husk [of evil in that thought].This itself is the help that is given to you from on high.68I heard from my master [the Baal Shem Tov] that even after Rabbi Nehunia benHaKaneh knew all the [Kabbalistic] meditations associated with prayer, he would stillpray like a small child,69Accustom yourself to pray and recite the Psalms in a very low voice. Screamquietly, saying the words with all your strength. This is the meaning of the verse, “Allmy bones shall say [God, who is like You]” (Psalms 35:10). A scream that results fromcomplete attachment [to God] is absolutely silent.70"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"There is a “burning sword that rotates, to guard the way of the Tree of Life”(Genesis 3:24).When you wish to attach your thoughts to the Creator in the supernal worlds, the[Evil] Husks (K'lipot) do not allow you. But even though you are not able, you mustexert yourself with all your strength over and over again, even during a single prayer.Eventually you will bind yourself to God and enter the supernal Universes.The faith with which you should strengthen yourself is the fact that “The wholeearth is filled with His glory” (Isaiah 6:3). One must have perfect faith, as it is written,“The righteous man lives by his faith” (Habakkuk 2:4).Even if you fall from a high level during a prayer, continue to recite the words withconcentration to the best of your ability. Then strengthen yourself to return to yourlevel. You may do this many times during a single prayer.First pronounce the word itself. This is the body. Then place a soul in the word.71At first, you should arouse your body with all your might. Only then will the powerof your soul shine for you.The Zohar thus teaches, “If fire does not burn brightly, tap the wood, and it blazesforth. If the light of the soul does not burn brightly, tap the body, so that the light ofthe soul should blaze forth.”72When a person does this successfully, he can worship in thought alone, without anymotion on the part of his body.When a person is attached to God in a Supernal Universe, he must be careful not toallow his body to move, since this will destroy his attachment.73Sometimes you may be praying in a state of Constricted Consciousness. Then in aninstant, the light of your soul blazes forth, and you ascend to one of the upperUniverses. It is very much like climbing a ladder.The supernal Light is alluded to in the verse, “Send forth Your light and truth, theywill lead me” (Psalms 43:3).74In silent prayer, you can attach yourself on high. Then, if you are worthy, you can beelevated still higher in that same prayer. This is the meaning of the teaching, “Whenone comes to purify himself, he is helped.”75Through a prayer, you can be worthy of attaching yourself on high. Then, from thispower, you can rise to a still higher level. When you reach this higher level, you can beattached on high even when you are not praying.766. SPIRITUAL ASCENTAlthough prayer was the primary vehicle for spiritual ascent, the Hasidic mastersoften discussed the concept in more general terms. One could climb the spiritualladder, from one chamber to the next, from one Universe to the one above it. One"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"would thus go through the four universes, Asiyah, Yetzirah, Beriyah and finally toAtzilut, the Universe of the Sefirot.Using these universes for spiritual ascent and attaching one's mind on high plays animportant role in the Baal Shem's system. The general level which one attains throughsuch ascent is called Devekut (), which literally means “attachment.” Here it refersto a particular attachment to the spiritual.SOURCESI heard from my master [the Baal Shem Tov] that a person is like the “ladderstanding on the ground, with its top in the heavens” (Genesis 28:12). He can doworldly, physical things here on earth, but “its top is in heaven,” since he meditates onlofty concepts. The person then binds the deed to his thought, and this in itself is aYichud (Unification).77My master [the Baal Shem Tov] once explained this in more detail. He said that aperson must place his mind on each physical thing, elevating it and binding it on high. .. .He also taught that when a person studies a difficult subject and does not understandit, then he is on the level of Malkhut-Kingship. But when he places his mind on it,understanding it and probing its depths, he then binds Malkhut-Kingship to Binah-Understanding, and attaches the two together.78My master [the Baal Shem Tov] revealed to me that when a person has pain,whether physical or spiritual, he should meditate that even in this pain, God can befound. He is only concealed in a garment in this pain. When a person realizes this, thenhe can remove the garment. The pain and all evil decrees can then be nullified.79Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov said that when he is attached to God and a thought fallsinto his mind, this is a minor level of Ruach HaKodesh.80Think of yourself as a resident of the Supernal Universes, and you will not considerthe people of this world important. For the physical world is like a mustard seedcompared to the Supernal Universes. Meditate on this and it will make no difference toyou whether people love you or hate you. Their love and hate will be nothing to you.81When you are attached to one of the Supernal Universes with no extraneousthoughts, you can then receive a thought very much like prophecy. This thought comesbecause of an announcement on high regarding the same subject.Sometimes you hear a voice speaking. This is because the Supernal Voice isattached to the voice of your prayer and Torah study. You then hear the likeness of avoice speaking, and it can reveal future events.82If you wish to ascend on high, you must go from one step to the next.First, you should have in mind that you are ascending only to the first Firmament,"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"which is a journey of 500 years. In your mind, expand this firmament on all sides. Itshould not appear small and narrow in your mind, but broad, filling the entire mind.Once you stand there, you must strengthen your mind to go higher, and then stillhigher. You must go step by step, however, since you cannot ascend through all SevenFirmaments [at once].The only time that it is possible to do this is in the middle of prayer. If you attachyourself [on high] properly at the very beginning, then you can ascend to all SevenFirmaments at once.83When you come to the First Firmament in your ascent from level to level, you mustsee to two things. First, you must see to it that you do not fall down again, and second,you must see to it that you should ascend still higher.Since in your mind you are literally in the First Firmament, you can then ascend tothe next Firmament. [You can climb from one Firmament to the next] until you reach[Yetzirah], the world of Angels. You then climb to [Beriyah], the world of the Throne.Finally all that remains is the Universe of Atzilut. When you reach this level, youcan bind your thoughts to God.84When you desire to ascend, you will first see the form of a man and an image ofdogs. These are the [Evil] Husks (Klipot), which are in the Universe of Asiyah. Youmust strengthen yourself and not be afraid.Sometimes you can speak on high with your soul alone, without your body. This iswhen you separate yourself from your body, and it is called “divestment of thephysical” (Hit-pashtut HaGashmiut). In such a state you feel no bodily sensation andare totally unaware of the physical world. Your entire mind depicts only the SupernalUniverses, with their angels and archangels.When you reach the Universe of Atzilut, you are devoid of all sensation. All that youexperience is the most etherial feeling, which is nothing other than God's closeness.On this level, you can know future events. Occasionally, you can also become awareof future events in the lower [three] Universes, since it is there that they areannounced.Sometimes you will have to make many attempts, just to ascend from oneFirmament to the next. This interval is a journey of 500 years, and sometimes you canfall in the middle.85Regarding this, Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov said, “When I bind my thoughts to God,I let my mouth say anything that it desires. I have bound my speech to its highest Rootin the Divine, and every word has a Root on high in the Sefirot.”He also said, “Sometimes I sit among people engaged in idle talk. I attach myself toGod properly, and I can bind all their words on high.”86When you are properly attached to God, you can engage in any activity that youwish. It appears that you are gazing at the subject of your activity, but actually, you are"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"gazing at nothing other than God.87When your thoughts ascend on high to the Supernal Universes, you must strengthenyour mind. You will then be able to stroll through these Universes just like a personstrolls from one room to the next.88I heard this from my master [The Baal Shem Tov]. Wherever a person places histhoughts, that is where all of him is.89It is written, “Send Your light and Your truth, they will direct me” (Psalms 43:3).The whole earth is filled with the glory of the Divine Presence, and this is what bringsyour thought from the lower world to the transcendental. With that great power, yoursoul ascends and with your thoughts, you break through the Firmaments. It is as if theyare opened before you.You are thus brought to the Universe of Yetzirah, then to the Universe of Beriyah,and finally to the Universe of Atzilut.You must first bring your thoughts down below, and then you can ascend on high. Inyour thoughts, you must descend and ascend many times. This is because you mustcome down before you can go up.When you descend, that is when you gain power. When you go up once again, youare then able to ascend to a still higher level. This is like a person throwing a rock[where he must lower his hand before he throws it].When you ascend mentally to the Universe of Asiyah or Yetzirah, you should havein mind [the entities] in that world are speaking, and that their speech is beingexpressed by your mouth in that Universe. You should also meditate that God is infront of you in the Ten Sefirot of that Universe, and that His greatness is infinite.Wherever you ascend on high, keep in mind that you are bringing yourself closer toGod, and binding yourself to Him on a higher level. The Zohar thus says, “The King'sfeet are not the same as the King's head.”90At all times during the day, even when you are not praying, you should mentallyelevate your thoughts on high. This takes great effort. Strengthen yourself with all yourpower of concentration, even if at first you do not ascend very high.Do not attempt to ascend too quickly. First attempt the Universe of Asiyah, thenYetzirah, then Beriyah, and finally Atzilut.91The supernal universes are really very great, but because the soul is clothed in thebody, they seem very small. But when a person divests himself of his physical bodilynature, then with his mind he can see that these universes are very great.92When you bind yourself to God, then through you, all the worlds under your handare bound to God.Through eating and wearing clothing, you have the power to include in yourself theconcepts of animal, vegetable and mineral in all universes, and through you, they can"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"all be bound to God. But this is possible only when you attach yourself to God.When a person does not believe with absolute faith that through his words andattachment to God he can accomplish such things, then nothing at all is actuallyaccomplished on high.It is therefore written [that the angel who wrestled with Jacob] “touched the hollowof his thigh” (Genesis 32:26) This means that [the angel] took away his faith.93Faith is all-important. Many people love and fear God, but still, they accomplishnothing on high because they lack absolute faith.94It is written, “The Living Angels ran and returned” (Ezekiel 1:14). I heard thefollowing explanation of this from my master [the Baal Shem Tov].Every thing has a burning desire and longing to return and attach itself to its root.The soul therefore also constantly desires to attach itself to its Root on high.[The soul would thus want to constantly satisfy] this longing through worship andTorah study.If the soul were to constantly experience this ardor, it would totally nullify itself.[Totally swallowed up in God, it would revert to the state that existed] before theWorld of Rectification came into being.This is the mystery of the “Graves of Desire” [where out of longing and desire, thepeople were totally nullified in the Infinite Essence, and thus ceased to exist] asdiscussed in B'rit Menucha. . . .95God therefore arranged that man should have to occasionally engage in his worldlyneeds. He must eat, drink, and earn a livelihood to some degree, even though he iswilling to make do with little. At these times, he is prevented from worshipping God,and the soul can rest.The individual's mental faculties are then [renewed and] strengthened, so that he canonce again engage in worship.This is the mystery of, “The Living Angels ran and returned.”967. NOTHINGNESSIn classical meditation, the most difficult path is undirected meditation. This is apath where one must totally clear one's mind of all thought and sensation, whetherphysical or spiritual. All that one experiences on this level is absolute nothingness.It is significant to note that in classical Kabbalah, the highest spiritual levels arealso referred to an Ayin () — literally, “nothingness.” Thus, the Universe of Beriyahliterally refers to the level that is called “creation.” Creation, however, is defined asbringing forth “Something from Nothing.” The level above Beriyah, from which itemanates, must therefore be considered “Nothing.” It is in this context that theuniverse of Atzilut is often referred to as “Nothingness.”"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"This term is also used to denote Keter-Crown, the highest of the Sefirot in Atzilut.With regard to Chokhmah-Wisdom, the second highest Sefirah, it is written, “Wisdomcomes into being from Nothing (Ayin)” (Job 28:12). Thus, Keter-Crown, the level fromwhich Chokhmah-Wisdom emanates is also called “Nothingness.” While Atzilut ingeneral is nothingness in a conceptual sense, Keter-Crown is nothingness in even aspiritual sense.97This is also suggested by the term Ain Sof (), an appelation often assigned toGod in the Kabbalah. Literally, Ain () means “without” and Sof () means “end.”Ain Sof is therefore usually translated to mean “The Endless One,” the “InfiniteBeing,” or simply, “The Infinite.”98 The term “Ain Sof,” however, also has theconnotation as “The Nothingness End” or “The Ultimate Nothingness.” In this context,it refers to the ultimate level in Nothingness to which one ascends.Undirected meditation on Nothingness is one of the most dangerous methods inclassical meditation, and should not be attempted except under the guidance of amaster. Prior to the Hasidic masters, there is virtually no mention whatsoever of thismethod. Even in the Hasidic writings, it is only mentioned occasionally and obliquely,but the few references are highly significant. It is discussed most often by theMezricher Maggid, and by his most illustrious disciple, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak ofBerdichov (1740–1809).SOURCESThe many levels of the mind include the thinker, thought and speech. One isinfluenced by the other.Speech exists in time. Thought is also in time, since a person has different thoughtsat different times.There is also an essence that binds the thinker to thought. This is an essence thatcannot be grasped. It is the attribute of Nothingness. It is often referred to as the Hyle[the state between potential and realization].An egg becomes a chicken. There is, however, an instant when it is neither chickennor egg. No person can determine that instant, for in that instant, it is a state ofNothingness.The same is true of the transition of thinker to thought, or of thought to speech. It isimpossible to grasp the essence that unites them.In order to bind them all together, one must reach the level of Nothingness.Moses thus said, “If Nothingness, erase me” (Exodus 32:32). [The Israelites hadbowed down to the Golden Calf and] had been blemished by idolatry. What Moseswanted to do was elevate them back to their original level. He therefore broughthimself to the level of Nothingness, and [wishing to go still higher,] he prayed, “eraseme.”99 When he reached the highest level, he was able to bind all things on high.100"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Think of yourself as nothing, and totally forget yourself when you pray. Only havein mind that you are praying for the Divine Presence.You can then enter the Universe of Thought, a state that is beyond time. Everythingin this realm is the same, life and death, land and sea.. . . But in order to enter the Universe of Thought where all is the same, you mustrelinquish your ego, and forget all your troubles.You cannot reach this level if you attach yourself to physical worldly things. Forthen, you are attached to the division between good and evil, which is included in theseven days of creation. How then can you approach a level above time, where absoluteunity reigns.Furthermore, if you consider yourself as “something,” and ask for your own needs,then God cannot clothe Himself in you. God is infinite, and no vessel can hold Him atall, except when a person makes himself like Nothing.101In prayer, you must place all your strength in the words, going from letter to letteruntil you totally forget your body. Thinking how the letters permute and combine witheach other, you will have great delight. If this is a great physical delight, it is certainlya great spiritual delight.This is the Universe of Yetzirah, [the world of Speech].The letters then enter your thoughts, and you do not even hear the words that youpronounce. This is the Universe of Beriyah, [the world of Thought].You then come to the level of Nothingness, where all your [senses and] physicalfaculties are nullified. This is the Universe of Atzilut, [which parallels] the Attribute ofChokhmah-Wisdom.102Nothing can change from one thing to another [without first losing its originalidentity]. Thus, for example, before an egg can grow into a chicken, it must first ceasetotally to be an egg. Each thing must lose its original identity before it can besomething else.Therefore, before a thing is transformed into something else, it must come to the"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"level of Nothingness.This is how a miracle comes about, changing the laws of nature. First the thing mustbe elevated to the Emanation of Nothingness. Influence then comes from thatEmanation to produce the miracle.103When a person gazes at an object, he elevates it into his thought. If his thought isthen attached to the supernal Thought, he can elevate it to the supernal Thought. Fromthere it can be elevated to the level of Nothingness, where the object itself becomesabsolute nothingness.This person can then lower it once again to the level of Thought, which issomethingness. At the end of all levels, he can transform it into gold.103God is boundless. This means that there is nothing physical that can hinder Hispresence. He fills every element of space in all universes that He created, on all levels,and there is no place devoid of Him.104When a person ascends from one level to the next, but still wants to attain more,then he has no limits and is literally like the Infinite. This person then has the attributewith which to grasp the seed transmitted from the Infinite Being.But when a person says, “That which I can grasp is sufficient for me,” he then onlyaspires to the straw and chaff, which are the Husks.105Man is primarily his mind. It would be natural for something which is mind to onlybind itself to mental concepts.One should therefore keep in mind this thought: “Why should I use my mind tothink about physical things? When I do this I lower my mind by binding it to a lowerlevel. It would be better for me to elevate my mind to the highest level, by binding mythoughts to the Infinite.”Even physical things must serve the Creator in a spiritual manner. It is thus taught,“They are My slaves, and not slaves of slaves.”106Love is not restricted by limitations. For love does not have any bounds, being anaspect of the Infinite Love.If one has love for something physical, then this physical thing becomes a vessel[that limits] his love.But when one has love for the Infinite Being, then his love is clothed in the Infinite.Both the love and its vessel are then boundless. The same is true of all otherattributes.107When a person repents and directs his love toward God, his thought is, “Why did Iexpend my love for physical things? It is better for me to love the Root of all Roots.”His love is then rectified, and he draws the Sparks of Holiness out from the Husks.108[God is called] the Endless One (Ain Sof), and not the Beginningless One.If He were called the Beginningless One, it would be impossible to even begin to"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"speak about Him. But to some extent, it is possible to comprehend Him through Hiscreation. This is a beginning, but it has no end.109Rabbi Levi Yitzchak:The most important thing to realize is that God created all and that He is all.God's influence never ceases. At every instant, He gives existence to His creation, toall the universes, to the heavenly chambers, and to all the angels....We therefore say [in the prayer before the Sh'ma], “He forms light and createsdarkness” [in the present tense], and not “He formed light and created darkness” [in thepast tense]. We say that God “creates” in the present tense because every second hecreates and gives existence to all that is.Everything comes from God. He is perfect and He includes all things.When a person attains the attribute of Nothingness, he realizes that he is nothing,and that God is giving him existence. He can then say that God “creates” — in thepresent tense. This means that God is creating, even at this very moment.When a person looks at himself and not at Nothingness, then he is on a level of“somethingness” [and independent existence]. He then says that God “created” — inthe past tense. This means that God created him earlier [but that he now hasindependent existence].We therefore say the blessing, “[Blessed are You, O God . . .] who created man withwisdom.” [We use the past tense,] since Wisdom is on a level of “somethingness.”We therefore find in the writings of the Ari that the expression, “God is King,” is anaspect of Nothingness. For when we say that “God is King” [in the present tense] itmeans that He is presently giving us existence. This is the aspect of Nothingness — weare nothing, and it is God who is giving us the power [to exist.].On the level of Nothingness, everything is above the laws of nature. On the level of“somethingness,” on the other hand, all things are bound by nature.The way in which we bind “somethingness” to Nothingness is through the Torah andcommandments. This is the meaning of the verse, “The Living Angels ran andreturned” (Ezekiel 1:14) — [that is, from a level of Nothingness to one of“somethingness.”]The Zohar teaches that the commandments and Torah are both hidden andrevealed.110 “Hidden” alludes to Nothingness, while “revealed” applies to“somethingness.” They thus bind something to Nothingness, and Nothingness tosomethingness.This is the meaning of the word Mitzvah (), meaning “commandment.” When wereverse the Hebrew alphabet through the Atbash () cipher, then Alef () becomesTav (), Bet () becomes Shin (), and so on. [Through this cipher, the Mem () ofMitzvah () becomes a Yod (), while the Tzadi () becomes a Heh ()"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"[The first two letters of Mitzvah therefore] are Yod Heh (), the first two letters ofthe Tetragrammaton, YHVH ().111This is an aspect of Nothingness.The last two letters of the word are Vav Heh (), [the last two letters of theTetragrammaton].This is an aspect of somethingness.The letters Yod Heh () [in the word Mitzvah] are hidden, just like the concept ofNothingness. (The letters Vav Heh (), on the other hand, are written directly, and arerevealed, just like somethingness. ]The commandments thus have a hidden part and a revealed part. The hidden part isour bringing pleasure to God through our observance of the commandments, since wehave no way of detecting this. [The revealed part is] when we benefit ourselves, sincethis is visible.This is the meaning of the verse, “Hidden things belong to the Lord our God, [butrevealed things belong to us and to our children forever]” (Deuteronomy 34:22).“Hidden things” allude to the hidden part of the commandment, and these “belong tothe Lord our God.” What we accomplish with relation to God is hidden from us.“Revealed things belong to us and to our children,” however, since the divineinfluence that we bring about is revealed to us.112At every instant, all universes receive sustenance and Life Force from God. Man,however, is the one who motivates this sustenance and transmits it to all worlds.When a person wants to bring new sustenance to all universes, he must attachhimself to the level of Nothingness. This is the level in all universes that were notconstricted.When man nullifies himself completely and attaches his thoughts to Nothingness,then a new sustenance flows to all universes. This is a sustenance that did not existpreviously.A person must fear God so much that his ego is totally nullified. Only then can heattach himself to Nothingness. Sustenance, filled with all good, then flows to alluniverses. . . .The individual thus attaches the Life Force of all universes to Nothingness, which ishigher than all worlds. . . . On the level where this [Life Force] had not yet beenconstricted into the universes, it is attached to the Nothingness, which is called theHyle. . . .1138. RABBI NACHMAN'S WAYThe classical word for meditation is Hitbodedut, which literally means mental self-seclusion. Although this term has been used in this context for a thousand years, the"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"name with which it is most often associated is Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810). Where other masters speak of Hitbodedut only occasionally, Rabbi Nachmanhas provided us with an entire literature.The Hitbodedut meditation taught by Rabbi Nachman would be called inner directedmeditation in classical terminology. That is, rather than concentrating on someexternal thing, such as a name or a mantra, one concentrates on the thoughts that arisein his mind. In Rabbi Nachman's system, one does so in the context of prayer,expressing, these spontaneous thoughts as prayers before God. Although it is oftenreferred to as spontaneous prayer, Rabbi Nachman's Hitbodedut is actually one of theclassical methods of meditation.Rabbi Nachman was the last master of Kabbalah meditation, and it is with him thatwe conclude this discussion. Looking at the entire field of meditation from a historicalviewpoint, we find that the closer one gets to the present, the less dangerous and moreuniversal the methods become. The techniques of the Hekhalot and Abulafia are highlyadvanced and dangerous, and should be used only after many, many years ofpreparation. The Ari's Yichudim and Kavanot, on the other hand, involve only thoughtand are much gentler in their effect. The Baal Shem Tov made use of the prayer servicealmost as a mantra, making the method accessible to all who could recite the service.But still, Rabbi Nachman's method was the most universal, and could be used byliterally everybody.Besides being a great master of a major meditative school, Rabbi Nachman hasattained great fame as a story teller, and his tales have taken their place among theclassics of world literature. He was also a major Kabbalist, according to some, on alevel as great as that of the Ari and the Baal Shem Tov.A great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, Rabbi Nachman was born in the founder'shouse in Medzeboz on Rosh Chodesh Nissan, 5532 (April 4, 1772). His father, RebSimcha, was the son of Rabbi Nachman Horodenker, a leading disciple of the BaalShem Tov. Feiga, his mother, was the daughter of Udel, who in turn was the onlydaughter of the Baal Shem. Rabbi Nachman's birth occurred at a time when Hassidismwas in deep trouble, and it was on the day of his circumcision that the dread Cherem orban was pronounced against the entire Hassidic movemnt.In many ways, Rabbi Nachman's childhood resembled that of his illustrious great-grandfather, and he also spent hours meditating in the fields and mountains, hiding hisbrilliance and piety from those around him. He married at an early age, and settledwith his father-in-law in Ossatin, in the Western Ukraine. When his mother-in-lawdied and his father-in-law remarried, the new mistress of the house made thingsdifficult for the young Tzaddik, and he moved away to take a post in Medvedevka,several miles away. Renowned as a direct descendent of the Baal Shem Tov, RabbiNachman had no difficulty in attracting a following, but as he matured, he became abrilliant leader in his own right."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"It was from Medvedevka that Rabbi Nachman set out on his pilgrimage to the HolyLand in the spring of 1798. After a long delay in Istanbul due to Napolean's EgyptianCampaign, he finally set foot on the Holy Land a day before Rosh HaShanah(September 10, 1798). There he met Rabbi Avraham Kalisker, leader of the Holy LandHassidim, and a strong bond of friendship developed between the two. Upon his return,he made a valiant attempt to subdue the dispute which had been raging between RabbiAvraham and Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, even making a 700-mile trip to see thelatter.In the fall of 1800, Rabbi Nachman moved from Medvedevka to Zlatipolia, just afew miles from Shpola. Rabbi Leib, the Shpola Zeida (Grandfather), was obviouslyannoyed at the intrusion of this young “upstart,” and after a number of falseaccusations on the part of his followers, began a heated controversy against RabbiNachman. Things became so bad that Zeida tried to enact a ban of Cherem against theYoung Rebbe, and it was only the intervention of Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berdichovand his uncle, Rabbi Baruch of Medzeboz, that prevented it. This controversy,however, was not to abate, and it led to great persecutions of the Breslover Hassidimafter Rabbi Nachman's death.Not being able to bear the pressure of this controversy, Rabbi Nachman moved toBreslov in the central Ukraine, arriving there on 10 Elul, 5562 (September 7, 1802). Itwas here that he attracted his major disciple and Boswell, Rabbi Nathan of Nemerov.Most of the teachings of Rabbi Nachman that have survived were written down byRabbi Nathan, and the master himself said, “If not for my Nathan, no memory of myteachings would have remained.”Early in 1805, Rabbi Nachman instructed Rabbi Nathan to begin arranging histeachings in order, compiling what was to become his magnum opus, the LikuteyMoharan (Anthology of Our Master, Rabbi Nachman). A little over a year later, RabbiNachman's infant son, Sh'lomo Ephriam, died. Stricken by grief—and perhaps out of aneed to rectify his son's death—Rabbi Nachman set out on a long mysterious journeyin the winter of 1807. It was during this journey that his wife died, and he contractedthe tuberculosis that was to take his life.Suffering from consumption, Rabbi Nachman journeyed to Lemberg (Lvov) wherehe sought medical treatment. It was during this period that he sent Likutey Moharan tobe printed, and it was completed in the late summer of 1808.After a fire burned Rabbi Nachman's house in the spring of 1810, he relocated inUman (a city half way between Kiev and Odessa), scene of the great massacre of 1768,where tens of thousands of Jews had been slaughtered by the Haidmacks. RabbiNachman said that he now had the task of rectifying these souls with his own death. Itwas also his desire to be buried in Uman's martyr-filled cemetery.While in Uman, Rabbi Nachman became quite friendly with a number of secularizedJewish intellectuals who. lived there. He declared that it was an important task to bring"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"these “lost souls” back to the truth. One of the leaders of the anti-religious“enlightenment” of Uman declared that if Rabbi Nachman had not died prematurely,he would have made him into a religious Jew.With tuberculosis sapping away his strength, Rabbi Nachman barely made it throughthe High Holy Days. He passed away during Sukkot, on 18 Tishrei, 5571 (October 16,1810). Early the next day, he was laid to rest in the old cemetery in Uman, and hisgrave remains a shrine to Breslover Hassidim to this very day.After his master's death, Rabbi Nathan worked diligently to keep the group together.Gathering penny by penny, he printed the second part of Likutey Moharan, as well asthe Sichot HaRan and Sichot Moharan, compilations of Rabbi Nachman's sayings.Mercilessly hounded by Rabbi Moshe of Savran because of false accusations, thegroup barely survived the next few decades. It was only Rabbi Nathan's tremendousdedication and strength of character that kept the Breslover Hassidim alive as a group.Despite the persecutions, a synagogue was built in Uman, numerous books published,and the group eventually grew to number in the thousands.Although Rabbi Nachman's teachings comprise a good number of volumes, his ideasregarding meditation are collected in a remarkable book called Hishtapchut HaNefesh(Outpouring of Soul).SOURCESYou must include yourself in God's unity, which is the imperative Existence. Youcannot be worthy of this, however, unless you first nullify yourself. It is impossible tonullify yourself, however, without Hitbodedut-meditation.When you meditate and express your spontaneous thoughts before God, you can beworthy of nullifying all desires and all evil traits. You will then be able to nullify yourentire physical being, and become included in your Root.The main time to meditate is at night. This is a time when the world is free frommundane concerns. Since people are involved in the mundane by day, you will be heldback and confused, so that you will not be able to attach yourself to God and includeyourself in Him. Even if you yourself are not so involved, since the world is concernedwith worldly vanities, it is difficult for you to nullify yourself.It is also necessary that you meditate in an isolated place. It should be outside thecity, or on a lonely street, or some other place where other people are not found. Forwherever people are found, they are involved in the mundane world. Even though theymay not be in this place at that time, the very fact that they are usually there canconfuse one's meditation, and then one cannot nullify himself and include himself inGod.You must therefore be alone, at night, on an isolated path, where people are notusually found. Go there and meditate, cleansing your heart and mind of all worldly"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"affairs. You will then be worthy of a true aspect of self-nullification.Meditating at night in an isolated place, you should make use of many prayers andthoughts, until you nullify one trait or desire. Then make use of much meditation tonullify another trait or desire. Continue in such a time and place, proceeding in thismanner, until you have nullified all. If some ego remains, work to nullify that.Continue until nothing remains.If you are truly worthy of such nullification, then your soul will be included in itsRoot, which is God, the Necessary Existence. All the world will then be included inthis Root along with your soul.114Hitbodedut-meditation is the best and the highest level of worship.Set aside an hour or more each day to meditate, in the fields or in a room, pouringout your thoughts to God. Make use of arguments and persuasion, with words of grace,longing and petition, supplicating God and asking that He bring you to serve Him intruth.Such meditation should be in the language that you normally speak. It is difficult toexpress your thoughts in Hebrew, and the heart is therefore not drawn after the words.We do not normally speak Hebrew, and are not accustomed to expressing ourself inthis language. It is therefore much easier to express yourself in your native language. .. .In your everyday native language, express all your thoughts to God, speaking ofeverything that is in your heart. This can involve regret and repentance for the past, orrequests and supplications asking that you should truly come close to God in thefuture. Every person can express his own thoughts, each according to his level.You should be very careful with this practice, accustoming yourself to do it at a settime each day. The rest of the day can then be joyous.This is a very great practice. It is the best possible advice, including all things. It isgood for everything that may be lacking in your relationship with God. Even if you arecompletely removed from God, you should still express your thoughts to Him, and ask[that He bring you back].Even if your words are blocked, and you cannot open your mouth to God, you canstill prepare yourself to do so. Even getting ready to speak to God is in itself verygood. Even though you cannot speak to Him, you long and yearn to do so — and thisitself is very good.You can even make a prayer out of this itself. You can cry out to God that you are sofar from Him that you cannot even speak. You can ask Him to have mercy on you andopen your mouth so that you should be able to express your thoughts to Him.You should know that many great, famous saints (Tzaddikim) said that they onlyreached their high level through this practice of Hidbodedut-meditation. If you havewisdom, you will understand the importance of this practice, and how it brings one"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"higher and higher. Yet, it is something that can be done equally by every individual,great and small alike. Everyone can observe this practice and reach the highest levels.Happy is he who does so.115You should be consistent in your meditation, expressing your thoughts before Godeach day.Even if you cannot speak at all, you should simply repeat a single word, and this,too, is very good. If you can say nothing else, remain firm, and repeat this word overand over again, countless times. You can spend many days with this one word alone,and this will be very beneficial. Remain firm, repeating your word or phrase countlesstimes. God will eventually have mercy on you and open your heart so that you will beable to express all your thoughts.Speech has great power. It is even possible to prevent a gun from firing. Understandthis.116You must be worthy to be able to meditate for a given time each day, [thinkingabout your life] and regretting what you must. Not every one can have such mentaltranquility each day. The days pass and are gone, and you find that you never once hadtime to really think.You must therefore make sure to set aside a specific time each day to calmly reviewyour life. Consider what you are doing, and ponder whether it is worthwhile for you todevote your life to it.A person who does not meditate cannot have wisdom. He may occasionally be ableto concentrate, but not for any length of time. His power of concentration remainsweak and cannot be maintained.If a person does not meditate, he also does not realize the foolishness of the world.But when an individual has a relaxed and penetrating mind, he can see that it is allmeaningless.117It is best to meditate in the meadows outside the city. Go to a grassy field, and thegrass will awaken your heart.118Know that when you pray in the fields, all the grasses come into your prayers. Theyhelp you and give you strength to pray.It is for this reason that prayer is called Sichah. This shares a root with the word forgrass, as in, “All the grass (Si'ach) of the field . . .” (Genesis 2:5).It is thus written, “And Isaac went out to meditate (Suach) in the field” (Genesis24:63). His prayer was helped and strengthened by the field, since all the grassesfortified and aided his prayer.119Rabbi Nachman said that the main time that King David would meditate upon Godwas at night, under the covers in bed. Hidden from the sight of all others, he wouldpour out his heart before God. He therefore said, “I meditate every night on my bed in"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"tears” (Psalms 6:7).120It is very good to have a special room, set aside for Torah study and prayer. Such aroom is especially beneficial for secluded meditation and conversation with God.Rabbi Nachman said that it is very good even to sit in such a special room. Theatmosphere itself is beneficial, even if you sit there and do nothing.Even if you do not have a special room, you can still meditate and express yourthoughts to God.Rabbi Nachman said that you can create your own “special room” under your Tallit.Just drape your Tallit over your eyes and express your thoughts to God as you desire.You can also meditate with God in bed under the covers. This was King David'scustom, as he said, “I meditate every night on my bed in tears” (Psalms 6:7).You can also converse with God while sitting before an open book. Let others thinkthat you are merely [reading or] studying.There are many other ways in which you can accomplish this if you truly want tomeditate and express your thoughts to God. Above all else, this is the root andfoundation of holiness and repentance.121Elijah was an ordinary human being, living in this world. But through secludedmeditation, he reached such a high level that he never tasted death.From Rabbi Nachman's words, it was obvious that Elijah reached his high level onlythrough this practice. The same is true of all the other great saints.122There are many prayers, supplications and petitions that have already beencomposed. The Destroyers and Denouncers know of them and therefore lay in the wayto ambush these prayers.You can travel on a path that is well-trod, known and publicized to all. Butmurderers and robbers also know of this road, and lay in wait there. But when youtravel on a byway, taking a route that is as yet unknown, robbers are also ignorant of it.The same is true here. Your personal prayers before God are like a new route. Theyare prayers that have been composed in your heart, and are not being expressed for thefirst time. Therefore, no Denouncers lie in wait for these prayers.Nevertheless, [your own prayers are not enough]. You should also be very careful tosay the other [standard] supplications and prayers.123"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"NotesChapter One: Meditation1.

In Devash LePhi,Alef 1, the Chidah writes that the final letters of the patriarch's names, whentransformed by the AtBash code, spell out the divine name Shaddai. The source ofthis is obviously Abulafia's Chayay Olam HaBah (Jewish Theological Seminary, Ms.2158) p. 7a.11. See Bet HaMidrash, Volume III, p. XL, note 6. In the beginning of Ginat Egoz,Gikatalia appears to indicate that he was initiated into the mysteries in the year KeterTorah () of his life. In its “minor numerical value” (Mispar Katan), KeterTorah has a value of 25, indicating that this is the age when he began. It is alsosignificant to note that the same expression, Keter Torah, in a similar context can befound at the beginning of Sefer HaTzeruf, which is usually attributed to Abulafia.However, this begins to raise the possibility that this was also written by Gikatalia.Further evidence is from the expression “Know my brother, may God watch you,”which is found in the same manner in Sefer Ha Tzeruf and in Ginat Egoz. It is very"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"possible that Sefer HaTzeruf was written by Gikatalia while under the influence ofAbulafia. In many manuscripts, Sefer Ha Tzeruf is followed by Perush HaNikkud (cfParis, Ms. 774, p. 38b), and the system of the latter is not that of Abulafia at all.Regarding the expression Keter Torah, see also Get HaShemot (Oxford, Ms. 1658) D.101a.12.

These words are only in Shaarey Kedushah.13. This is an important concept discussed at length among later Kabbalists, seeAvodat HaKodesh, Avodah 10, Toldot Yaakov Yosef, Sh'lach, p. 133b; MaggidDevarav LeYaakov (Jerusalem, 1971) #66, 159; Likutim Yekarim (Jerusalem, 1974)#224, Tzavaat HaRivash (Kehot, New York, 1975) #73. Cf. Midrash Tehillim 20:1.14. Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge (Chakhmah, Binah, Daat), are the upperthree Sefirot. The word Havayot (nvin) can mean “existences,” but here it meansTetragrammatons, since the word Havaya () is of ten used for theTetragrammaton. In the very next quotation in Shaarey Kedushah (p. 19b), a systemis presented, where each of these “Lights” parallels the Tetragrammaton withdifferent vowel points. The table of correspondence between the Lights and Sefirot isbased on this. See p. 119.15. Mishnah, Berakhot 5 :1 (30b). The discussion here is very similar to that foundin Sefer Cheredim, Tshuvah 3 (Jerusalem, 1958) p. 215. See above, Chapter 2, note 9.16. Berakhot 32b.17. Most manuscripts end here.
