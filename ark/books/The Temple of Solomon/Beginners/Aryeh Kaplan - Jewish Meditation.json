When shown texts that describe Jewish meditation, theyrespond that it belongs to esoteric or occult corners of Judaism and has little todo with mainstream Judaism.It is therefore not surprising that many current books on meditation give scantattention to Judaism. Although most writers seem to be aware that mysticalelements exist in Judaism, their discussion is usually restricted to the Kabbalahor the Chasidic masters. Most books on meditation emphasize Eastern practices,and in some instances Christian meditation, but Jewish meditation is for allpractical purposes ignored.For students of meditation, this is a serious oversight. Judaism produced oneof the more important systems of meditation, and ignoring it is bound to makeany study incomplete. Furthermore, since Judaism is an Eastern religion thatmigrated to the West, its meditative practices may well be those most relevantto Western man. Without a knowledge of Jewish meditative practices, animportant link between East and West is lost. This omission is all the moresignificant in light of considerable evidence that the Jewish mystical masters haddialogue with the Sufi masters and were also aware of the schools of India.For the Jew, however, the lacuna is most serious. Jews are by nature aspiritual people, and many Jews actively seek spiritual meaning in life, often ona mystical level. Generations ago, large numbers of Jews were attracted to themystical traditions of groups such as the Freemasons. Today, many AmericanJews have become involved in Eastern religions. It is estimated that as many as75 percent of the devotees in some ashrams are Jewish, and large percentagesfollow disciplines such as Transcendental Meditation.When I speak to these Jews and ask them why they are exploring otherreligions instead of their own, they answer that they know of nothing deep orspiritually satisfying in Judaism. When I tell them there is a strong tradition ofmeditation and mysticism, not only in Judaism, but in mainstream Judaism,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"they look at me askance. Until Jews become aware of the spiritual richness oftheir own tradition, it is understandable that they will search in other pastures.A few years ago, I was invited to speak in a small synagogue in upstate NewYork. The weather was bad that evening, and only twenty people showed up, soinstead of giving the lecture I had planned, I gathered everyone into a circle andjust talked. Most of the people there had relatively little knowledge of Judaism.In the course of our talk, I began to discuss the Shema and how it can be used asa meditation (see chapter 3). One of the women present asked if I would do ademonstration, and I agreed.The whole meditation could not have taken more than ten or ɹfteen minutes.Ordinarily, it would have taken longer, but in this situation I felt pressed fortime. Still, at the end, everyone present, including me, was literally breathless.Collectively, we had experienced a significant spiritual high.“Why can’t we ever do anything like this at services?” asked one of the men.It was a question I could not answer. The discussion turned to how cold andspiritually sterile synagogue services can be, and how a technique like this,which works so well in a group, could make the service inɹnitely moremeaningful. Together we questioned whether the synagogue service was initiallymeant to be a meditative experience.If ɹnding spiritual meaning is diɽcult for the uncommitted Jew, it issometimes diɽcult for the Orthodox Jew as well. I have been approached byyeshiva students who are committed to observing the rituals of Judaism but failto see how these practices can elevate them spiritually. Even more troubling isthe number of Orthodox Jews who are involved in disciplines such asTranscendental Meditation. Most of them express uneasiness about thesepractices but feel that the beneɹts outweigh the dangers. When asked why theydo not seek this type of experience in Judaism, they give the same answer asuncommitted Jews: they are not aware that such an experience can be foundwithin Judaism.When my ɹrst book on the subject, Meditation and the Bible, was published in1978, it sparked a new interest in Jewish meditation in many circles. For mostpeople, it was the ɹrst intimation that Jewish meditation existed. Although thework drew on a considerable amount of published material, most of the sourceshad never been translated from the Hebrew and were available only toexperienced Hebraic scholars. Even then, much of the material was diɽcult tounderstand for someone who had not engaged in meditative practices. To makethis material accessible, the keys to understanding had to be found, and many ofthese keys existed only in ancient, unpublished manuscripts."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"It is signiɹcant that most of the important texts on Jewish meditation havenever been published, even in their original Hebrew. The most important worksexist only in manuscript, locked away in libraries and museums. To research thisbook, as well as a subsequent work, Meditation and Kabbalah, the manuscriptsɹrst had to be located; this involved searching through scholarly journals andlibrary catalogues. Once the manuscripts were found, copies had to be obtained,and when they were located in places like the Lenin Library in Moscow, this wasnot an easy task. Many of the manuscripts were hundreds of years old, writtenin obsolete scripts that could be deciphered only with considerable eʃort. Theeʃort was worth it, however, and many important keys to Jewish meditationwere discovered.Because so little on Jewish meditation was ever published, many peopleargued that meditation was to be found only in the backwaters of Judaicliterature—in works not even worthy of publication. Actually, many worksdealing with Kabbalistic methods of meditation were not published because thepractices were dangerous and were not meant for the masses. Still, even theseworks shed considerable light on obscure passages found in publishedmainstream works; they are an integral part of the puzzle, without which majorareas of Judaism are diɽcult, if not impossible, to understand. Once the puzzlebegan to come together, it became clear to me that some of the most importantmainstream Jewish leaders of the past relied on various meditative techniques.With the publication of Meditation and the Bible, interest in Jewish meditationbegan to grow. Even the Lubavitcher Rebbe issued a directive that Jewish formsof meditation should be explored. Groups that taught and practiced Jewishmeditation were formed in the United States and Israel. I felt privileged that mybooks formed the basis of many of these groups.Unfortunately, a number of groups also involved in “Jewish meditation” werepracticing something far from Judaism. Some of them attempted to adaptEastern practices to Jewish audiences, or to Judaize Eastern teachings. Althoughthese groups attracted a following of sorts, they were not teaching Jewishmeditation.Meanwhile, together with a group of committed Jewish psychiatrists andpsychologists, I began to experiment with the techniques I had found in theliterature. Together we explored the inner space of the meditative state. Amongthe participants were David Sheinkin (of blessed memory), SeymourApplebaum, and Paul (Pinchas) Bindler. Other members who made importantcontributions to the group were Arnie and Roz Gellman, Miriam BenhaimCirclin, Sylvia Katz, Jeʃ Goldberg, Gerald Epstein, Perle Epstein, and many"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"others.One important discovery we made was that most texts dealing with Jewishmeditation assume that the reader is familiar with the general techniques, andintend only to provide additional detail. The details were fascinating, but whenwe tried to translate them into practice, we discovered that too muchinformation was missing. It was like trying to use a book on advanced Frenchcuisine without a rudimentary knowledge of cooking. The recipes were there,but a novice could not use them. In the case of Jewish meditation, theingredients were there, but the means of mixing them together were omitted orglossed over.To some degree, the puzzle was pieced together in my two previousmeditation books. However, neither of these books was meant to be a practicalguide. Many people expressed the need for a guide to Jewish meditation writtenin nontechnical terms for the layperson. It was out of these requests that theidea for this book was born.This book presents the most basic forms of Jewish meditation, especially asdiscussed in mainstream sources. It assumes no special background on the partof the reader either in Judaism or in meditation. It is my hope that this bookwill at least begin to provide its readers with insight into the spiritualdimensions of the Jewish heritage.Aryeh Kaplan December 17, 1982"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1WHAT IS MEDITATION?What is meditation? For someone who has been involved in the practice, thequestion need not be asked. For a person who has never had any contact withmeditation, however, the subject is shrouded in mystery. To many people, theterm “meditation” suggests an image of someone sitting in the lotus positionwith eyes closed in serene concentration. Others may associate meditation withholiness and spirituality. Individuals seeking spirituality might look into variousdisciplines of meditation without having any idea of what they are looking for.In its most general sense, meditation consists of thinking in a controlledmanner. It is deciding exactly how one wishes to direct the mind for a period oftime, and then doing it.In theory this may sound very easy, but in practice it is not. The human mindis not a domesticated animal, but rather seems to have a mind of its own beyondthe will of the thinker. Anyone who has ever tried to concentrate on a subject,only to have his mind drift to other thoughts, is aware of this. Sometimes itseems that the more one tries to control one’s thoughts, the more they refuse tobe controlled.It is strange that most people have never given a thought to their thoughts.Thoughts are so much part of our being that we take them for granted. One ofthe first steps in meditation is learning how not to take our thoughts for granted.A simple exercise will demonstrate how diɽcult it is to control your thoughts.In theory this exercise seems ridiculously simple, but in practice it istantalizingly difficult.This is the exercise: Stop thinking.Normally, when one is not otherwise occupied, there is a constant ɻow ofthought passing through the mind. In this reverie, one thought ɻows intoanother, almost automatically. This ɻow of thought goes on and on, like aninternal conversation with oneself. Usually, this reverie is so much part of ourmental environment that we do not pay attention to it.The ɹrst exercise is to become aware of your thoughts by trying to stop them."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Try to blank out your mind for a few minutes and not think of anything at all.Sound easy? Stop reading now and try it.All right. How long did it last? Unless you are very unusual, or have hadmeditative experience, you could not keep your mind blank for more than a fewseconds. If nothing more, the period of mental silence was probably interruptedby the thought, “I’m not thinking,” or “I’m trying not to think.” In practice, it isextremely diɽcult to turn oʃ thought. As we shall see, control over the thoughtprocess is one of the goals of some meditative disciplines.There is another way in which you can try to control your mind. When youɹnish this paragraph, close your eyes. You will probably see lights or imagesɻashing before your eyes. Give yourself a few moments to relax, and theseɻashing lights will subside and develop into a series of kaleidoscopic images inthe mind’s eye. These images will arise and change spontaneously with little orno direction by the conscious mind. One image ɻows into another as stillanother grows and develops. It is almost impossible to concentrate on thesemind-begotten images, because when you try, they disappear.Now, with your eyes closed, try to control these images. Try to depict theletter A in your mind’s eye. Unless you have practiced this technique for sometime, it is impossible to hold on to this image.One of the techniques of meditation is “imaging,” evoking an image in themind’s eye and holding it there. In Jewish meditation, this is known as“engraving.” Here the image is ɹxed in the mind as if it were engraved, so thatit can be held in the mind as long as one desires. This technique can be perfectedonly through extensive training.Having tried these two exercises, you can see that the mind has a “mind of itsown.” There are thus two parts to the mind, one that is under the control of theconscious will and one that is not. That part of the mind under the control of thewill is called the consciousness, while that which is not is called the unconsciousor subconscious. Since the subconscious is not under the control of the will, onecannot control what it passes into the conscious mind.One of the goals of meditation, then, is to gain control of the subconsciouspart of the mind. If one were to succeed, one would also gain a high degree ofself-mastery. This, too, is a goal of meditation.This explains why so many disciplines use breathing exercises as a meditativedevice. Breathing usually occurs automatically and is therefore normally underthe control of the unconscious mind. Unless you are consciously controlling yourbreathing, it will mirror your unconscious mood. This is one reason whybreathing is one of the indicators in a lie detector test."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Yet, if you wish, you can control your breath, and do so quite easily.Breathing therefore forms a link between the conscious mind and theunconscious. By learning how to concentrate on and control your breath you cango on to learn how to control the unconscious mind.The thought process itself is also controlled to a large degree by theunconscious, but it can also be controlled by the conscious mind. This is mostobvious in the case of the reverie. When one is relaxing and not payingparticular attention to it, the reverie ɻows from one thought to another withoutconscious eʃort. Indeed, there are a number of psychological techniques that tryto imitate this “free association,” in order to gain an understanding of theunconscious mind. However, no matter how free the association may be whenone is expressing it to a second party, it is never as free as in the case of purereverie. The reverie thus can also be seen as a point of interface between theconscious and unconscious. By learning how to control the reverie, one can alsolearn how to control the unconscious.The same is true of the visions that appear in the mind’s eye. Since they arenot under the control of the conscious mind, they are obviously coming from theunconscious. Controlling them is very diɽcult without practice; one can learn tocontrol them, however, and doing so also serves to form a bridge between theconscious mind and the unconscious.One of the most powerful beneɹts of meditation is control over theunconscious mind. One learns to use the conscious mind to control mentalprocesses that are usually under the control of the unconscious. Gradually, moreand more of the subconscious becomes accessible to the conscious mind, and onegains control of the entire thought process.Sometimes, diʃerent parts of the mind appear to be acting independently. Theconɻict between two parts of the mind can be so strong that a person feels liketwo separate individuals. During such inner conɻict, it seems that one part ofthe mind wants to do one thing, while the other part wants to do somethingelse.Thus, for example, a person may be drawn toward a sexual temptation. Onepart of the mind is thus saying yes very loudly. Yet, at the same time, anotherpart of the mind may feel that the act is morally reprehensible. This second partof the mind may be saying no with equal loudness. The person may feel caughtin the middle, between the two voices.In classical Freudian psychology, this would be seen as a conɻict between theid and the superego. In our example, the id would be saying yes to thetemptation, while the superego would be saying no. Somehow, the ego (the “I”)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"mediates between these two subconscious voices. Although Freud’s schematies itinto a neat package, introspection shows that the conɻict is actually morecomplex than the simple picture of the id and superego. Sometimes not two butthree, four, or more voices seem to be giving diʃerent signals in the mind. If aperson were to learn to control his subconscious, he could avoid much of thisconflict.There are many theories about the subconscious, and a full discussion is farbeyond the scope of this book. However, if meditation is controlled thinking, itimplies that the individual has the entire thought process under control,including input from the subconscious. The experienced meditator learns how tothink what he wants to think, when he wants to think it. He can always be incontrol of the situation, resisting psychological pressures that work on thesubconscious. He is also in control of himself, never doing something that heknows he really does not want to do. In many schools, this self-mastery is one ofthe most important goals of meditation."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2WHY MEDITATE?Meditation, which is thought directed by will, can bring many beneɹts. Mostpeople learn how to think as very young children, and throughout their adultlives, they do not think any diʃerently than they did as children. That is to say,most people use their minds in a manner not essentially diʃerent from the waythey did when they were six years old. Through meditation, one can control thethought process and learn to think in new ways, thus gaining new and richermind experiences.It is signiɹcant that in Kabbalah, one’s normal mode of thinking is referred toas the “mentality of childhood” (mochin de-katnuth). More advanced modes ofthought and states of consciousness, on the other hand, are referred to as the“mentality of adulthood” (mochin de-gadluth). One learns these methods of“adult thought” through meditation, through which one develops the ability totranscend the ways of thinking one learned as a child.In chapter 1, for example, we discussed how diʃerent parts of the mind actindependently. Thus, a person might want to concentrate on a task at hand, butat the same time other concerns pop into his mind, disturbing his concentration.While one part of the mind is trying to focus on a problem, other parts may bedrawing attention to diʃerent ideas. As long as this is true, concentration is notcomplete.For this reason, a person usually uses only a small portion of the mind. Asmuch as he might try to concentrate on a thought or task, parts of his mind areengaged in other activities. Sometimes the rest of the mind is merely passive. Atother times however, other parts of the mind may actually be acting inopposition to one’s concentration. Unless one is able to control the entire mind,one cannot develop full concentration.People often think of concentration in terms of problem-solving. It can alsoinvolve the most basic of experiences. Suppose, for example, that you are tryingto experience the beauty of a rose. At the same time, thoughts about yourbusiness may be pushing their way into your mind. Your attention does not stay"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"focused on the rose and you cannot see the rose totally, in all its beauty.But there is another factor that prevents you from experiencing the rosecompletely. Earlier, we discussed the spontaneous images that arise in the ɹeldof vision when the eyes are closed. Actually, you can also see these images withyour eyes open in a darkened room. Once you are aware of these images, youcan even see them with your eyes open in a well-lit room. The reason you arenormally not aware of these images is that they are very faint compared withthe images entering your mind from your open eyes. Nevertheless, they areconstantly with you.Now suppose you are trying to appreciate the beauty of a rose. No matterhow hard you try to focus your mind on the rose, the image of the rose iscompeting with the self-generated images in the mind. It is as if there were ascreen of extraneous imagery between you and the rose, preventing you fromseeing it with total clarity.In a meditative state, however, it is possible to turn oʃ the interference andconcentrate totally on the rose. As we shall see, with training, one can turn oʃthe spontaneous self-generated images and thus remove the screen. The beautyof the ɻower when seen in these higher states of awareness is indescribable tosomeone who has never experienced it. The most I can say is that the roseactually appears to radiate beauty. This can be true of anything else in theworld.Another important goal of meditation is thus enhanced awareness andperception. The greater the portion of the mind focused on an experience, themore the experience will be enhanced. When every cell in your brain is tuned into experiencing the rose, the experience is indescribably different from what youwould see in your usual state of consciousness.This works in one of two ways. The most simple way in which meditationworks is to quiet down all parts of the mind not concentrating on the immediateexperience. In this mode, the experience is not enhanced directly, but rather allinterference with it is removed. Thus, you may be looking at the rose with nogreater awareness than before, but without the mental static, it will appearmuch more vivid. It is somewhat like trying to tune in to a faint radio station;even if you cannot amplify the volume, you will hear the station more clearly ifyou can eliminate the static. This mode of meditation can be reached throughmost meditative techniques and is the state of consciousness most readilyattainable in its lower levels.The second way in which meditation can enhance an experience is by focusingmore of the mind on it. Ultimately, as one becomes a more experienced"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"meditator, one can learn to focus the entire mind on a single experience. This isanalogous to turning up the volume of a radio or using a system of greaterɹdelity. This level is attained in the more advanced states of meditation, andone can use it to exert the total force of one’s mind on anything one desires.Of course, neither mode is generally attained without the other. When youquiet other areas of the mind, you also focus more of the mind on theexperience. Conversely, focusing more of the mind on the experience almostalways involves blocking out other experiences and thoughts.This increased awareness can be used in many ways. Meditation can be usedto gain a greater and clearer awareness of the world around us. Looking atsomething like a rose while in a meditative state of consciousness, one can seemuch more in it than one would otherwise see. It has been said that one can seethe entire universe in a grain of sand. In a high meditative state, this is actuallypossible. As one’s capacity for concentration increases, one can also becomeaware of subtle phenomena that are not otherwise detectable. Thus, the worldof the meditator may become much richer than that of those who have neverhad the experience.Here again, there is a language barrier. If one has never experienced thesephenomena, then one cannot comprehend a description of them. The situationcan be better understood through analogy.For the average sighted person, a page of braille feels like bumpy paper andnothing more. A blind person, however, does not have his sense of sightcompeting with his sense of touch, and hence experiences less “static.”Furthermore, since he uses his sense of touch more often, his tactile sense isenhanced. With practice, he learns to decipher the patterns of raised dots asletters and words. It is true that a sighted person can also learn to read braille,but those who have mastered it usually read with their eyes closed, so that theirfaculty of sight will not interfere with their sense of touch.Reading braille is a good example of an experience that is meaningless to anonsensitized person but has a world of meaning for a sensitized person. Manysuch experiences may exist in the world, and meditation can teach one to “read”these messages.Another analogy may express this even more clearly. Many blind people learnto navigate by listening to the subliminal echoes given off by buildings and otherlarge objects. This is why blind people often tap their canes constantly; theylisten to the echoes produced by the tapping, and the echoes warn them ofobstructions. The strange thing is that blind people claim that they do notactually hear these echoes, but sense them in a manner that they cannot"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"describe. Rather than speak of this experience as hearing an echo, a blind personwill describe it as sensing an obstruction. These echoes are not perceptible to asighted person since the ɻood of information experienced through visionoverwhelms them completely. Moreover, there is a learning period during whicha blind person becomes sensitized to these echoes.On a more esoteric level, in Tibetan medicine, as well as in Kabbalah, anumber of illnesses can be diagnosed merely by feeling the pulse. The subtlediʃerences in the feel and rhythm of the pulse can provide a skilled practitionerwith a picture of the body’s state of health with uncanny accuracy. Observingthe Dalai Lama’s personal physician make such a diagnosis, a famous doctorreported that he had witnessed something bordering on the supernatural.The secret, however, is twofold. First, the practitioner must learn to enter adeep state of concentration in which the pulse beat ɹlls his entire world ofsensation and the subtlest variations in it stand out clearly and vividly. Thepractitioner is thus able to garner a great deal of information from the pulsebeat. To him, every pulse beat is an encyclopedia of information about thebody. Once he learns how to “read” the pulse beat in this manner, he can thenlearn what every variation means. People who have attempted to learn thistechnique report that it can take as much as ɹfteen years to master it wellenough to make an accurate diagnosis.A number of Judaic sources speak of meditation as a means of attainingextrasensory perception (ESP) in such areas as telepathy, mind-reading,clairvoyance, and predicting the future. These powers may also involveincreased awareness. In the ordinary state of consciousness, ESP signals receivedby the mind may be overshadowed by the perceptual information entering thebrain, as well as by the mind’s natural “static” or “noise.” As discussed earlier,this static consists of thoughts and images spontaneously produced by the mindwhich are not under the conscious mind’s control. In the meditative state, whenthis noise or static is quieted, ESP phenomena may become more readilydiscernible. A number of ESP experiments appear to indicate that this is true,and that meditation enhances the eʃect. Unfortunately, as in the case of mostESP experiments, results depend on so many variables that unambiguousconclusions are difficult to obtain.Another purpose of meditation is to attune the mind to certain truths (orTruths with a capital T). When a person tries to explore questions such as themeaning of existence, the true goal of life, or the ultimate nature of reality, theanswers remain elusive, tickling the edge of the mind. Possible answers hoveron the borderline of consciousness, but are so subtle that they cannot be"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"discerned through the static of the mind.One of the most elusive truths is knowledge of the self. Generally we seeourselves only through a thick veil of ego. For this reason, it is impossible to seeourselves as others see us. Through meditation, however, we can remove theveil of ego, and see ourselves with a degree of objectivity. In this manner, wecan look at ourselves objectively as a third person. We are then able to see ourown shortcomings and overcome them.The self-awareness engendered by meditation can also strengthen the egowhen needed. Thus, a person with a weak self-image and feelings of inadequacycan learn to be more self-assured. He can examine his motivations and learn tobecome more inner-directed, doing the things he desires, and not simply whatothers expect of him. He can look objectively at his relationships with othersand learn to improve them.One of the most powerful uses of meditation is to gain an awareness of thespiritual. Although we may be surrounded by a sea of spirituality, we are notusually aware of it. Spiritual sensations are quite faint and usuallyovershadowed by the world of the senses. Even in a state of sensorydeprivation, the self-generated thoughts of the mind tend to obscure spiritualsensation. However, if a person can quiet down all extraneous thoughts, he canthen “tune in” to the spiritual. This tuning-in is what is known as the mysticalexperience. In this sense, meditation is the most important technique of mysticsall over the world.The most vivid experiences were those attained by the prophets in the Bible.In the biblical sense, a prophet is more than a person who merely sees thefuture. Rather, he is one who has such a strong experience of the spiritual thathe can use it to garner information. Sometimes this information includesknowledge of the future, hence the popular conception of a prophet as one whosees what has not yet occurred. Nevertheless, the true prophet has access tomany other truths besides knowledge of the future. It is important to realize theimportant role that meditation played in the careers of the prophets of Israel.On its highest level, meditation can provide a person with an experience ofGod. This is certainly the highest possible spiritual experience. Our perception ofGod is often clouded by ego and anthropomorphism, so that we tend to see Godas a mirror image of ourselves. By freeing the mind of these encumbrances,meditation can help us to open our minds totally to the experience of God. Inmany religious traditions, including Judaism, this is the highest goal ofmeditation."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"3TECHNIQUESAt this point it would be useful to discuss and classify the various meditativetechniques, both Jewish and non-Jewish. The techniques of almost allmeditative systems can be classiɹed in similar ways; this does not imply anyspecial relationship between Jewish and non-Jewish meditation. Rather, since ageneral concept of meditation exists, all forms have characteristics in common,which in turn can be used to classify various techniques.The situation is analogous to that of prayer, which is important in all religioustraditions. Certain elements are characteristic of all prayer. This does not meanthat one system of prayer is derived from another, or even that a relationshipexists between the systems. Rather, the similarities stem from the fact that thereare a limited number of basic ways of relating to God, and these will be found inprayer wherever it exists.Thus, almost every prayer can ɹt into one of three categories: praise, petition,and thanksgiving. We can praise God and speak of His greatness. We canpetition God and ask Him to provide us with the things we need and want.Finally, we can thank God for what He has given us. In Jewish prayer, thesethree divisions are formalized and follow a set sequence. Nevertheless, if wewere to examine prayers of all the world’s faiths, we would ɹnd that with fewexceptions they would all fall into one of the three categories.The same is true of meditation. There are a ɹnite number of ways in which aperson can interact with his own mind, and these form the categories of allmeditation. Thus, when one understands meditation in general, one can thenunderstand Jewish meditation in particular. Since meditation involves subtleexperiences that may be unfamiliar to many readers, I shall begin with amundane example.I have deɹned meditation as a controlled manner of thinking. On the simplestlevel, you can decide to sit down for the next half hour and just think about oneparticular subject. Let’s say you decide that for the next half hour you will thinkabout rearranging your furniture. In your mind’s eye, you might imagine how"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"various arrangements would look and even plan how to move the heavierpieces. During that half hour, you will have been meditating on furniturearrangement. It is as simple as that. There need not be anything esoteric ormysterious about meditation. No special surroundings are required, nor mustany particular body position be assumed. You could have meditated whilewalking around the block, while sitting back in your easy chair, or whilerelaxing in the tub. The very fact that for a speciɹc time period you werethinking about a speciɹc topic rather than letting your mind wander at randommakes it a meditative experience.Of course, it is not always that easy. What do you do when other thoughtsbegin to creep into the mind? Remember that the decision was to think aboutarranging furniture and nothing else. If this meditation is actually going to be acontrolled thinking experience, then you will need a technique to rid yourself ofundesired thoughts. You might gently push the extraneous thoughts out of yourmind or otherwise pull your mind back to the desired subject. Whatever methodyou use to keep your mind on the subject, in doing so you will be developingthe rudiments of a full-fledged meditative technique.Meditation on rearranging your furniture may be a trivial example. Butsuppose you decided to spend a half hour meditating on how to rearrange yourlife. You might ɹnd yourself thinking about fundamental questions such asthese:What do I ultimately want out of life?What gives my life meaning?What is the meaning of life in general?If I had my life to live over, what would I do with it?What ideals, if any, would I be willing to die for?What would bring me more happiness than anything else in the world?You have probably already thought about these questions at some time inyour life. However, chances are that you thought of them only brieɻy. Unlessyou have been involved in a discipline that encourages it, you have probablynever spent a full half hour, without interruption, thinking about any of thesequestions. If you have never done so before, the ɹrst time may be veryshocking. You may discover that you have no idea of what you perceive as yourpurpose in life. You may have never thought about the meaning of life at all.Indeed, after a half hour of pondering any of the above questions, you mightdecide that the question needs more than one session of meditation. You might"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"decide to have a half-hour session once a week. To make sure that you continue,you may decide that at a certain time every week you will spend a half hourmeditating on the purpose of life as well as your own personal goals. You willthen be on your way to developing a discipline of meditation.After several weeks of such meditation, you will probably begin to noticeyourself growing in a number of areas. You might decide to reevaluate thedirection of your life and make major changes in your life-style. You might ɹndyourself more secure in your dealings with others, more conɹdent about howyou are spending your time. You may also ɹnd that you are constantly gainingnew insight into your own personality and motivations.At this point, you might feel that once a week is not enough. You may decideto increase the frequency of your meditation to two or three times a week oreven once a day. You will then discover why many schools of meditationsuggest or require that meditation be a daily exercise.As you continue to explore what is most meaningful to you, you may come toa point where you feel that you are reaching a new threshold. You may ɹndyourself pondering not only the meaning of your own life, but the very meaningof existence in general.At this point, you will have discovered God.Before discussing this further, it is important to deɹne God. We often think ofGod as being “out there,” far away from the world. But it is important to realizethat God is also “in there”—in the deepest recesses of the soul.Here are two ways in which a person can discover God.First, a person can reɻect on questions such as these: What is beyond spaceand time? How did the world come into existence? Why does the world exist?What came before time? By pondering such questions, a person can ɹnd God,but he will find God only in the sense that God is “out there.”The second way in which one can ɹnd God is by delving deeper and deeperinto the self in the manner discussed earlier. Here also one ɹnds God, but one isfinding Him in the sense that He is “in there.”This twofold manner of discovering God is related to the Kabbalistic conceptthat God both encompasses and ɹlls all creation. When we say that God is aboveall things and beyond all things, we are speaking of Him in the sense that Heencompasses and deɹnes all creation. This is the concept of God as being “outthere.” However, in another sense, God is very close to us—closer than the airwe breathe, closer than our very souls—and in this sense He ɹlls all creation,and is “in there.”Once a person discovers God in this manner, he might want to transform his"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"meditation into a conversation with God. If one discovers God as the ultimatedepth of one’s being, then the way to relate to this depth would be to relate toGod. At this point, one’s meditation into the meaning of existence might becomea silent conversation with God.It is signiɹcant to note that according to the Midrash, this is exactly howAbraham’s career began. First Abraham began to contemplate the meaning oflife and existence, and it was in this manner that he discovered God. Abrahamthen began to have a dialogue with God. Abraham’s experience can be seen as aparadigm of how to begin a relationship with the Divine.Again, the problem of extraneous thoughts may arise. One way to helpalleviate this problem is to speak to God out loud rather than just in the mind.One would then be speaking to God orally.Using oral conversation as a meditative technique is an ancient Jewishpractice, documented in a number of important texts. In particular, it was atechnique stressed by Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, as we shall see in chapter 10.There are three important things that could be said about the above type ofmeditation:1. It is a verbal type of meditation: it involves words in thought or speech, rather than images.2. It is inner-directed: the entire form of the meditation comes from within the person rather thanbeing determined by an external stimulus.3. It is unstructured: when the person sits down to meditate, he has no preconceived notion ofwhat direction the meditation will take.Some people ɹnd an unstructured meditation too loose. In order to putstructure into your meditation, you can write out an agenda. You may decidethat every day for a given period of time, say a week, you will meditate on onesubject; then you will go on to a second subject for the next week. Thus, if youare meditating on how to reorder your life, you might decide to spend one weekmeditating on your relationship with your spouse, a second week meditating onyour relationship with your children, and then two weeks meditating on yourcareer.As soon as one sets up an agenda of meditation, it becomes a structuredmeditation. Of course, a meditation can be loosely structured or tightlystructured, again depending on what one wishes to accomplish. Meditating withan agenda is a practice favored by the Musar schools in Judaism. This form ofmeditation is especially eʃective when one wants to perfect one’s habits orone’s way of life in general."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Another way to add structure to your meditation is to use a biblical verse asthe object of meditation. You could take verses randomly from the Bible or seekout verses that apply to the subject of your meditative interest. It is possible tomake the entire meditative session, for a day, a week, or a month, revolvearound that verse. Your goal would still be to rearrange your life, but you wouldbe trying to do so in the context of that biblical verse. The verse could also formthe basis of a conversation with God.The method of basing a meditation on a verse, known as gerushin, was used bythe mystics of Safed in the sixteenth century. Although the method was usedextensively, the texts provide few details. It appears that a number of ways arepossible.The simplest way to use a biblical verse as a meditation would be to read theverse before meditating, perhaps memorizing it, and then use it as a point ofdeparture for unstructured meditation. The meditator begins by meditating onthe verse and then goes on to direct his mind to the subject upon which hewants to meditate. The course of meditation could lead the meditator far fromthe original verse; the verse would serve merely as the initial focus of themeditation, not as its entire subject. This means of meditation is also discussedin Judaic literature.Alternatively, you may write the verse on a piece of paper. During the courseof meditation, you could then reread it, directing your mind back to the versefrom time to time. This is particularly eʃective if you wish to apply the verse toa particular life problem; in this way, the verse becomes an integral part of themeditation.Eventually, you may wish to make the verse the entire subject of meditation.In a sense, your meditation would become a conversation with the biblicalverse. You would be thinking about the verse, looking at it in diʃerent ways,seeking diʃerent possible interpretations, and attempting to apply it to yourparticular life problems. If the verse has a speciɹc lesson, you might use a seriesof meditative sessions to integrate the verse into your personality. Although wehave used a biblical verse as an example, any saying or teaching could be usedas the basis for such a meditation. To simplify our discussion, however, we willcontinue to speak of a biblical verse.The verse can be used either visually or verbally.If the verse is used visually as the basis for meditation, write the verse on apiece of paper and use it as a focus. Fix your gaze on the verse; do not take youreyes oʃ it. The verse should become the center of your attention to theexclusion of everything else. It should be as if nothing else in the world exists"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"other than the verse. You can then gaze at the verse and allow your thoughts toɻow freely. On a more advanced level, you could use this method to clear themind of all thought other than the verse.This method is known as visual contemplation. Using a verse is just one meansof accomplishing such meditation. The subject of your contemplation could alsobe a candle flame, a flower, a picture, a pebble, or any other object.Since this practice entails using something external to the mind as the objectof meditation, it is known as an externally directed meditation. This meditationcan be either structured or unstructured.The simplest way to do the meditation would be to gaze at the object and letyour thoughts ɻow freely. This would be an unstructured meditation. However,if you used the method to ɹll the mind completely, banishing all other thoughts,then this in itself would impose structure on the meditation, and it wouldconstitute a structured meditation.When one contemplates an object, one looks at it, paying acute attention toevery detail. As one continues to gaze, even the most minute details becomesigniɹcant. One can look deeper and deeper into the object, trying to see itsinner essence and obliterating all other thought from the mind. Beyond the inneressence, one can strive to see the Divine in the object and use it as a springboardto reach God.In lieu of gazing at the written verse, you could repeat the verse over andover for the entire period of meditation. This would be a verbal meditation asopposed to a visual contemplation. Here again, the meditation could beunstructured, where the mind is allowed to roam wherever the verse takes it.Alternatively, it could be structured, where all thought other than the words ofthe verse is removed from the mind.Of course, here again, the subject of meditation need not be a biblical verse.Any sentence, word, or phrase can do. As we shall see, the great Chasidic leaderRabbi Nachman of Bratslav prescribed using the phrase “Lord of the Universe”as a meditative device.In Eastern traditions, the repeated phrase is known as a mantra, andmeditation using such a phrase is called mantra meditation. One of the best-known examples of a system based on mantra meditation is TranscendentalMeditation. Since there is no equivalent English term for this type of meditation,I shall use the term “mantra” where necessary.There are, then, three ways in which the above-mentioned meditations can beclassiɹed. They can be either visual or verbal, structured or unstructured,internally or externally directed."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Inner-directed, unstructured meditation is most valuable as a means ofexamining one’s life or ɹnding meaning in life. Externally directed, structuredmeditation is most often used to focus the mind and thought processes or to gaina transcendental experience.Although most meditative methods are visual or verbal, other faculties can bethe focus of meditation as well. Thus, instead of meditating on an object orverse, one could meditate on a sound, such as the chirping of a cricket, the rushof a waterfall, or a musical note played over and over. One would be using thesense of hearing to direct the meditation, although in these cases the meditationwould be nonverbal.In a similar manner, the meditation could involve the sense of smell. Indeed,there are Hebrew blessings said over fragrances, and in practice they can makethe enjoyment of a fragrance into a meditative experience. The blessings overfood can make a meditative experience out of tasting and eating. The sense oftouch, too, can be the focus of a meditative experience.It is also possible to use the kinesthetic sense as the object of meditation. Thiswould consist of meditating on a body movement or a series of bodymovements. This is a method used by the Suɹs in their dance meditations.Chasidim often use this form of meditation in dancing and in their slow swayingmotions.Any action meditation can be seen as using the kinesthetic sense, even if othersenses are involved. The main thing is to concentrate on the act and elevate it toan expression of divine worship. This can include even mundane acts such aswashing the dishes.In Judaism, action meditation is most important when connected with theperformance of the commandments and rituals. Many Jews and non-Jews thinkof the precepts as routine, ritualistic actions. Many Jewish sources, however,speak of the commandments as meditative devices, which can bring a person toa high level of God consciousness. When the commandments are seen in thislight, they assume great spiritual significance.A ɹnal focus of meditation can be one’s own emotions. Thus, for example, onecan focus on the emotion of love in exactly the same way that one can focus ona ɻower or a candle ɻame. One can ponder the love one feels for anotherperson and enhance the emotion, experiencing it totally without any outsideinterference. One can also take this intensiɹed love and direct it toward God ortoward one’s fellow man. Indeed, the commandments “Love God your Lord withall your heart, all your soul, and all your might” (Deut. 6:5) and “Love yourneighbor like yourself” (Lev. 19:18) actually mandate such a meditation. When"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"one directs one’s mind to love God and one’s fellow man, one provides one’s lifewith an entirely new focus.Control of the emotions is a very important element of self-control in general.Often the concept of self-control conjures up the image of an emotionless, dry,rigid way of life. If a person is in complete control of his emotions, however, hecan call forth any emotion he desires and is free to enhance it as he wills. Ratherthan be controlled by emotions such as love, yearning, or awe, he can controlthem. One can evoke these emotions and blend them together, painting everyaspect of life with a rich palette of feelings. Control of the emotions can thuslead a person to experience a richer blend of feelings in his daily life than theaverage person generally experiences.The ɹnal types of meditation do not make use of any device, but involvedirect control of the thoughts. These are usually considered the most advancedforms of meditation.One such technique involves the exercise mentioned in chapter 1, in whichyou were asked to try to stop thinking for a period of time. For most people thisis impossible, and it is an excellent demonstration that the mind is not entirelyunder the control of the will. After a few seconds of trying not to think,thoughts begin to creep into the mind, and after a short period, they oftenreturn in a torrent.Like many other disciplines, this, too, can be developed. If a person practicesstopping his thought ɻow, he can learn to do so for longer and longer periods;eventually, he can learn to turn his thought processes on and oʃ at will. Thismay sound easy, but in practice it takes years of intense practice to perfect thisability.Since this type of meditation does not use anything as a focus, it is oftencalled nondirected meditation. In its more advanced forms, it can actually focuson “nonthought” or on nothingness. This form of meditation can be dangerousand should not be attempted without a practiced guide or master.Most of the methods that I shall discuss in this book, however, are fairlystraightforward and safe if practiced properly. They can be readily learned andcan bring the meditator to increased awareness and higher states ofconsciousness."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"4STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSMost discussions of meditation speak of higher states of consciousness that canbe attained through the practice. For the initiate these states of consciousnessmay be familiar, but for the outsider they are extremely diɽcult even toimagine. Much has been written about higher states of consciousness, but thediscussion usually concludes with a statement that these states are indescribableand ineffable.There is an important reason that such experiences are indescribable. In thecase of objective, external phenomena, a group of people can agree on words todescribe them. This is how language in general is constructed. Thus, two peoplecan look at a rose and agree that it is red. Since they are both seeing the samerose, they both have a common experience of which they can speak.However, when people try to discuss personal experiences in higher states ofconsciousness, the experiences are entirely internal. I have no way of knowingwhat is in your mind, so even if you try to describe it, I have no way of beingsure of what you mean. Furthermore, since the experiences are internal andindividual, it is diɽcult for people to ɹnd a common ground to develop adescriptive vocabulary. Vocabulary is based on shared experiences, and bydefinition, internal experiences are difficult if not impossible to share.For example, let us assume that while in a meditative state, I saw in my minda color that has no counterpart in the external world. Suppose it was totallydiʃerent from any other color and impossible to describe in terms of othercolors. How could I even begin to describe what the color looked like? Therewould be no words in human vocabulary to describe it. The same is true ofmany meditative experiences. This fact makes it extremely diɽcult to developan epistemology of the meditative state. One ends up trying to describeexperiences for which no language exists.This may be true, but since one of the aims of meditation is to reach higherstates of consciousness, we should at least have some idea what this means. Theproblem is that higher states of consciousness are not only diɽcult to describe,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"but also diɽcult to deɹne. There appears to be no objective epistemologythrough which one can know for sure that one is in a state of consciousnessdiʃerent from the everyday waking state. Nevertheless, on the basis ofsubjective experiences and reports, it is possible to gain some understanding ofthese states of consiousness.The two most familiar states of consciousness are the waking state and thesleeping state. These are two states of consciousness that are universally knownand recognized.Beyond that, we know that sometimes we may feel drowsy, while at othertimes we are particularly alert. This demonstrates that there are diʃerent levelsin the waking state of consciousness. Experiments in which brain waves aremeasured also indicate that diʃerent states of brain activity exist in the wakingstate. Evidence from sleep laboratories indicates that there are also at least twostates of consciousness involved in sleep, the ɹrst being the nondream state andthe second being the dream state, in which rapid eye movement (REM) isobserved.Certain drugs have an eʃect on a person’s state of consciousness. The bestknown is alcohol, which has the general eʃect of diminishing alertness, althoughsince it removes inhibitions, it can also lead to increased awareness in someareas. Other, more potent drugs, such as LSD and mescaline, appear to increasethe ability to focus on speciɹc sensations, such as beauty, color, form, and thelike. A full discussion of drug-induced states of consciousness is beyond thescope of this book. Instead, we shall explore states of consciousness that can beself-induced.I recall that when I was in yeshivah, a few friends and I decided to have acontest to see who could memorize the most pages of Talmud. For me, it was aninteresting experience. The ɹrst page took considerable eʃort and time, perhapsseveral hours. As I continued, each page became progressively easier.Eventually, after ten pages or so, I found that I could memorize a page afterthree or four readings. By the time I had gone through some twenty pages, Icould memorize a page with a single reading. What had originally beenextremely diɽcult had become relatively easy. My friends reported the sameexperience.It is well known that memory is a faculty that can be trained. People whoregularly memorize large quantities of information ɹnd themselves able to do sovery readily. Professional actors, for example, can memorize the lines in a playor movie in one or two readings. Similarly, many professional musicians canmemorize a score almost immediately."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"What was interesting from a subjective viewpoint was that it did not seem tome that my memory had improved. Rather, it seemed that when I looked at apage, I was looking at it diʃerently. It was as if my memory was wide open andthe material was going directly into it. It felt as if there was normally a barrierbetween perception and memory and that this barrier had now been removed.Logically, this would make sense. If we remembered everything we saw orlearned, our memory would rapidly become cluttered with useless information.The mind therefore has a sort of ɹlter that prevents unwanted information frombeing stored in the memory. The problem is that the ɹlter is sometimes therewhen one does not want it—such as when one wishes to memorize something.With training, however, one can learn to remove this filter at will.The point is that when a person has trained his mind to memorize, hisawareness when reading material to be memorized is completely diʃerent. Itcould be said that he is in a different state of consciousness at the time.Let me give another example. When I was a graduate student in nuclearphysics, I was once working on an extremely diɽcult mathematical problem fora paper. I became totally involved in the problem and worked on it for almostseventy-two hours without interruption. In order to solve the problem, I had toinvent a number of original mathematical techniques and procedures. But thestrange thing was that when I read the ɹnal paper two years later, I found italmost impossible to understand the mathematics. It was diɽcult to believe thatI had created this mathematical structure.Anyone who has ever worked on a diɽcult problem, especially inmathematics or the sciences, knows that at a certain point the mind seems to“lock on” to the problem. At that point, solving the problem becomes the mostimportant thing in the world, and every ɹber of one’s being is concentrated onɹnding a solution. Subjectively speaking, I know that I can accomplish thingswhen in a “locked-on” state that I cannot accomplish otherwise.In one of my advanced physics courses, I had a difficult mathematical problemon a test. I worked on the problem for a while and then, realizing that I was notmaking any progress, skipped to the next problem. Fortunately, this was a testin which one had to answer only three out of ɹve questions. Several monthslater, I was working on another paper and in the course of my calculationsfound myself confronted with a similar problem. This time, however, I was“locked on” to the problem and totally involved in it. Much to my surprise, Iwas able to solve the same problem that had stumped me on the test, literally inseconds. It felt like the simplest thing in the world, and indeed it was, since inthe course of my calculations I was routinely solving problems that were much"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"more complex and difficult.I use the term “locking on” since this is the subjective feeling that one has inthe kind of problem-solving that I am describing. When one is locked on to aproblem, there is tremendous, almost sensual joy in solving it. It is possible togo without food and sleep, to dismiss all fatigue, until the problem is solved.Beyond this, it appears that one can call forth intellectual resources of whichone is usually totally unaware.Being locked on to a problem also brings a person into a state of consciousnessdiʃerent from his normal state. A much greater portion of the mind seems to beinvolved in solving the problem than in a normal mental state. It could thereforebe considered a “problem-solving” state of consciousness.I also remember a period during which I was painting. I had just learned howto use acrylics and had found that I could produce a fairly decent piece of work.Whenever I got involved in a painting, it seemed that I was also “locked on” tothe project; I would ɹnd it extremely diɽcult to leave it. Again, I was able tocreate paintings that were surprising even to me. It appeared that when I wascreating, I was going into a higher state of consciousness. Subjectively, I did notsimply feel a sense of greater awareness or alertness; rather, I felt as if I werethinking in an entirely different mode.The diʃerence between ordinary intelligence and genius may not be so mucha matter of a person’s innate ability as his ability to “lock on” to the work athand and get into a higher state of consciousness. Ordinary people considerworks of genius beyond their reach, but this might not be true, since the creatorhimself may be surprised at what he produces when in a “locked-on” state ofconsciousness. The degree of creativity that one has, whether in art or inproblem-solving, may be several orders of magnitude greater when one is in a“locked-on” state than when one is in a normal state of consciousness. It may bethat the secret of genius is the ability to lock on to problems or creative eʃortson a much deeper level than most people ordinarily attain.This locked-on state of consciousness appears to be associated with increasedphysical energy. The pulse is quicker, and one may perspire profusely.Sometimes, one even has the experience of trembling with creativity. It seemsthat while one is in such a state, the energy that one is utilizing is much greaterthan normal, and not only is the mind completely involved in the creativeeffort, but also the body.There appears to be, however, another type of problem-solving consciousness.The ɹrst time I became aware of it was when, in the course of Kabbalisticresearch, I was trying to ɹgure out the properties of a ɹve-dimensional"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"hypercube. The problem was extremely diɽcult, since it involved trying tovisualize what would happen when the hypercube was rotated through ɹve-dimensional space. I had spent several afternoons sweating over the problem,without even coming close to a solution.Then, one evening, I was relaxing in the bathtub, and my mind wandered tothe problem, almost oʃhandedly. Suddenly, every aspect of the problem seemedperfectly clear, and relationships that had been impossibly complex were noweasy to visualize and understand. By the time I got out of the tub, I had workedout the problem completely.Eventually, I began to realize that this was happening to me often. Sitting inthe tub was an excellent time to solve the most diɽcult problems. But theexperience was very diʃerent from being locked on to a problem. Quite to thecontrary, the mind was free to wander wherever it wanted, but it seemed to hitupon the right answers with surprising clarity.It seems that the mind has two modes in which it possesses abnormal abilityto solve problems. One is the “locked-on” mode, in which the energy of bothmind and body is increased. The other is when a person is completely relaxedand the mind drifts to the problem on its own.I think of the “locked-on” mode as a “hot” mode of thought and the relaxedmode as a “cool” mode of thought. In both cases, one’s problem-solving ability istremendously expanded. In hot concentration, the entire body is brought intoplay and, as it were, the adrenaline is made to ɻow. In cool concentration, bodyand mind are quieted down as much as possible, so that the mind is able to focuson the problem like a laser beam.These two examples may seem far removed from the usual discussion of thehigher states of consciousness associated with meditation. However, there areimportant links.First, there are intellectual modes of meditation. In some traditions, they areassociated with “the way of the intellect.” Some types of meditation appear tobe designed to produce precisely the states of consciousness in which problem-solving ability is enhanced.There is also a direct relationship to the better-known forms of meditation.Mantra meditation, which consists of repeating a word or phrase over and over,is said to elicit the “relaxation response.” Many clinical psychologists use thistype of meditation to induce relaxation in their patients. Indeed, a type ofmantra meditation known as Standardized Clinical Meditation (SCM) has beendevised as a therapeutic tool, devoid of all mystical elements.While this technique appears to relax the body, it also increases the mind’s"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"activity. Mantra meditation can be used to relax the body and bring the mindinto a state of “cool concentration.” When a person is in such a state, his controlof his mind processes seems to be increased. This can be demonstrated by asimple experiment:Sit down in a straight-backed chair. Your back should be straight, since if youare in a hunched or slouched position, you will begin to feel cramped after awhile. This experiment should be done at a time when you know that you willnot be disturbed or interrupted.Begin by relaxing completely. Then close your eyes. Initially, you will seelights and images ɻashing in the mind’s eye. After a minute or two, these ɻasheswill begin to coalesce and take the form of kaleidoscopically changing images, asdiscussed earlier. As you relax, the images will begin to change more and moreslowly, and eventually they will remain in the mind’s eye long enough for youto focus on them.Just concentrate on the images. If other thoughts enter the mind, gently pushthem out. Try to maintain your concentration on the forms that arise in yourmind’s eye, and on nothing else. Gradually, you should ɹnd that you can hold onto an image for quite a while.The ɹrst few times you do this, try to relax and concentrate on the images inyour mind’s eye without doing anything else. Each session should last for twentyto thirty minutes. Gradually, your ability to hold images and focus on themshould increase.Once you have reached this stage, you are ready to demonstrate to yourselfthe eʃects of mantra meditation. Since you are only experimenting, and notmaking a long-term discipline of it at this point, it does not matter what you usefor a mantra. It can consist of a nonsense phrase, a favorite line of poetry, aphrase from the Bible, or any other group of words. Some people ɹnd the words“My name is—–” an easy phrase to begin with. If you wish to make a morespiritual experience of it, you can use Rabbi Nachman’s mantra, “Lord of theUniverse,” or its Hebrew equivalent (see chapter 5).Sitting comfortably, just repeat your experimental mantra over and over. Atthis point, it does not matter how you repeat it. You may wish to chant itslowly, whisper it, or silently mouth the words. The phrase should be saidslowly, over and over again, for the entire session. After a while, you will beginto feel very relaxed and at the same time very alert.Now, while repeating the mantra, pay attention to the images formed in yourmind’s eye. As the mind quiets down, these images should become more andmore vivid, and you should be able to hold them in the mind for longer and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"longer periods. The images may become spectacular and beautiful, sometimeseven breathtaking.The images formed in the mind’s eye constitute one of the few objectiveindicators of the meditative state. You know that you are in a meditative statewhen the imagery in the mind’s eye begins to take on a more substantial andpermanent form. While imaging is not the only manifestation of higher states ofconsciousness, it is an indicator that is important and easy to describeobjectively. Other indicators are also manifestations of one’s control over themental process, just as visualization is.Since this is being done as an experiment, it is not advisable to go too far inthis direction without carefully planning out a course of meditation. But theexperiment shows that in higher states of consciousness, one’s ability to formimages in the mind and concentrate on them is greatly enhanced.After progressing in meditation and learning how to concentrate, a processthat can take weeks or months, one can learn how to control the images seen inone’s mind’s eye. At this point, one can conjure up an image and hold it in theɹeld of vision as long as one desires. As we shall see, this in itself can become aform of meditation.Earlier, we discussed the random images that appear in the mind’s eye andspoke of them as being a sort of static produced by the brain. Although thisstatic is most easily seen with the eyes closed, it also exists when we are lookingat things; at that time, it tends to dull our perception. Thus, if one is looking at arose, the experience of the rose’s beauty is diminished by this static.When a person learns how to hold an image in the mind, however, he can alsocontrol the mind’s static. He can then see things without being disturbed by thebrain’s self-generated images. This is especially signiɹcant in the appreciation ofbeauty. If a person “turns oʃ” the mind’s static and then looks at a rose, theimage in his mind’s eye will contain nothing other than the rose. Since at thispoint he can see the rose without any static, the beauty of the rose is enhancedmanyfold. This is one reason that many people report an enhanced sense ofbeauty while in the meditative state. Indeed, many people learn meditationprimarily to experience the new aesthetic experiences that can be encounteredin such states of consciousness.Once a person learns how to control the visions in the mind’s eye, he canprogress to increasingly more advanced visualizations. The simplest stages ofvisualization are straightforward; one conjures up images of ɹgures, letters,objects, or scenes. What one sees is not much diʃerent from what one sees withnormal vision. Nevertheless, to make the images in the mind’s eye appear as"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"solid and real as waking images requires considerable training. As one becomesmore advanced, the images can appear even more real than what one sees withopen eyes.The more advanced one becomes in controlling one’s mind, the more controlone has over what one can see in the mind’s eye. When a person becomes expertin visualization, he will be able to see things in the mind’s eye that he couldnever see with his physical eyes. From descriptions in Kabbalistic and othermystical works, it appears that many experiences encountered in higher states ofconsciousness fall into this category.Thus, for example, the Zohar speaks of the “lamp of darkness.” This appearsto denote a darkness that radiates. Similarly, in Talmudic sources, there arereferences to “black ɹre.” There is a teaching that the primeval Torah wasoriginally written “with black ɹre on white ɹre.” This is something that wecannot see with ordinary vision, and indeed, it is impossible to imagine in anormal state of consciousness. Ordinarily, we see bright colors, not blackness ordarkness, as radiant.In the mind’s eye, however, it is possible to visualize a lamp radiatingdarkness. It would be like the negative image of a lamp radiating light. Just aswhen one sees light, one is aware that energy is being radiated, when one seesthe lamp of darkness, one would be aware of negative energy radiating.Visualizing “black ɹre” would be a very similar experience. When a person haslearned to control his visualization experience, negative energy becomes asimple thing to visualize.It is also possible for a person to intensify his perception of beauty in animage in his mind’s eye. This is beyond the enhanced perception that we havediscussed earlier, in which one removes the static and focuses the entire mind ona beautiful object. Rather, one would be turning up the “beauty” dial in themind, to make the mind particularly sensitive and appreciative of beauty. Theimage that one then sees in the mind’s eye may appear thousands of times morebeautiful than an image seen with the physical eyes, since one is intentionallyamplifying the sensation of beauty.This is significant, since Beauty (tifereth) is one of the Ten Sefiroth discussed inKabbalah. The Ten Seɹroth are Will (keter), Learning Ability (chokhmah),Understanding (binah), Love (chesed), Strength (gevurah), Beauty (tifereth),Dominance (netzach), Submissiveness (hod), Sexuality (yesod), and Receptivity(malkhuth). These Seɹroth may be looked upon as “dials” in the mind that canbe used to amplify the experiences associated with them. Thus, since Beauty isone of the Ten Sefiroth, one can turn up the “dial” and amplify the sensation."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Another important phenomenon that can be experienced in a higher,controlled state of consciousness is panoscopic vision. Normally, when one looksat a solid object, one can see only one side of it at a time. Similarly, in themind’s eye, one usually visualizes something only one side at a time. Of course,in the case of a real object, one can rotate it to see the other side, and one cando the same in the mind’s eye. In a higher state of consciousness, however, it ispossible to attain panoscopic vision, whereby one can look at an object in themind’s eye from all sides at once.Thus, for example, if one were looking at America on a globe, one would notbe able to see Asia, since it is on the opposite side of the globe. However, in ahigher state of consciousness, it would be possible to visualize the globe and seeAmerica and Asia simultaneously. It is impossible to describe this sensation toone who has never experienced it. A number of modern artists, such as Picasso,seem to have had such experiences and attempted to depict them on canvas.The human mind can normally visualize an object only from one side becausethis is the way we see with our eyes. This is merely due to habit from the timeof infanthood. When one learns how to control one’s mental processes, one canbreak these habits and visualize things in totally diʃerent perspectives.Panoscopic vision is one example of this phenomenon.There is evidence that the prophet Ezekiel had such an experience in hisfamous vision. He describes certain angels, known as chayyoth, as having fourdiʃerent faces on four diʃerent sides: the face of a man, the face of a lion, theface of an ox, and the face of an eagle. Yet he continually stresses that theseɹgures “did not rotate as they moved.” What he was saying was that althoughhe saw the chayyoth from only one side and they did not rotate, he could see allfour faces at once.Even more spectacular is the fact that in an advanced state of consciousness, itis possible to visualize more than the usual three dimensions. Of course, withour physical eyes, we never see more than the three-dimensional world aroundus. However, in higher meditative states, it is possible to visualize four andsometimes even ɹve dimensions. There is evidence that the Sefer Yetzirah (Bookof Creation) contains meditative exercises that include such visualizations.Synesthesia is another important phenomenon observed in higher states ofconsciousness. Human senses tend to be compartmentalized, so that diʃerentparts of the mind deal with diʃerent senses; one part of the mind may deal withsight, while another deals with hearing. In a normal state of consciousness, wedo not see sounds or hear colors.In higher states of consciousness, however, the barriers between the senses"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"are lowered. In such states, one’s sense of sight can be used to perceive sounds.Similarly, one is able to hear colors, see fragrances, and feel sights. This is theexperience of synesthesia, which means “mixing of senses.”Even in a normal state of consciousness, on an ethereal level, one may have avague feeling that a sound or melody has a particular texture or color. This isbecause the barriers between the senses are never totally absolute. In higherstates of consciousness, however, the spillover can become quite vivid. Forexample, one may see a piece of music as a complex visual pattern. I am sayingnot that the music is associated with the pattern, but that the music is thepattern. It is a very strange sensation, which is impossible to describe tosomeone who has never experienced it.There is Talmudic evidence that synesthesia was associated with the mysticalstate of revelation. When the Ten Commandments were given, the Torahdescribes the people’s experience by stating, “All the people saw the sounds”(Exod. 20:18). An ancient Talmudic source states that “they saw that whichwould normally be heard, and heard that which would normally be seen.” Thisis a clear example of synesthesia.Another phenomenon that can be visualized in a higher meditative state isnothingness. When we think of nothingness, we often think of it as simpleblackness, a vacuum, or the interplanetary void. None of this, however, is truenothingness. Blackness or space cannot be nothingness, since “blackness” and“space” are things themselves. Nothingness must be the absence of everything,even of blackness and empty space.If you want to know what nothingness looks like, just focus on what you seebehind your head. (In some systems, one focuses on what one sees inside thehead.) Obviously, you cannot see anything behind your head. But this meansprecisely that what you see behind your head is nothingness. Therefore, if youwant to know what nothing really looks like, concentrate on what you seebehind your head.If you wanted to visualize nothingness in a meditative state, you would haveto take this perception of nothingness and bring it into your mind’s eye. In anormal state of consciousness, this would be impossible, but in higher states ofconsciousness, with training and practice, it can be accomplished. Indeed, in anumber of systems of meditation, it is an important practice.For one thing, ɹlling the mind with nothingness is a highly eʃective way ofclearing it of all perception. There are some experiences that are so subtle thateven the visualization of blackness or empty space could overshadow them.However, when the mind is ɹlled with the experience of nothingness, it is open"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"to the most subtle influences.One of the inɻuences that the mind can detect while visualizing nothingness isthe spiritual. In such a state, the spiritual can appear very spectacular, since thenothingness in the mind can be filled with that which comes from the Without.Of course, visualizing nothingness is a highly advanced technique. Thespiritual, however, can be experienced on much simpler levels. Indeed, thereappears to be an area of the mind that is particularly receptive to the spiritualexperience. Sometimes, without warning, a person can have a spiritualexperience that leaves him awestruck or exhilarated. A more intense spiritualexperience can have a profound effect on a person’s entire life.Just as a person can amplify his sense of beauty through meditation, he canalso amplify his sense of the spiritual. If part of the mind is particularly sensitiveto the spiritual, then through meditation this sensitivity can voluntarily beenhanced and increased. This results from the control of the mind that one hasduring the meditative experience.Enhanced spiritual experiences are associated with the states of consciousnessexperienced by prophets and mystics. The senses are blocked out, and allsensation, both internal and external, is eliminated. In such states ofconsciousness, the feeling of the Divine is strengthened, and a person canexperience an intense feeling of closeness to God. Meditations of this type canbring a person to the most profound and beautiful experiences imaginable.A word of caution is in order at this point. The experiences that a person canhave in these states of consciousness can be so beatiɹc that he may not want toreturn to his normal state of consciousness. It is possible for a person to becomecompletely lost in the mystic state, acutally swallowed up by it. Therefore,before exploring these highest states, be sure that you have something to bringyou down safely. It is very much like ɻying a plane. Taking oʃ is exhilarating,but before you take off, you had better know how to land again.For this reason, most texts on Jewish meditation stress that before embarkingon the higher levels, a person should have a master. Then, if he goes “up” anddoes not know how to come down, or does not want to, the master will be ableto talk him down.Other sources indicate that mystics would actually take an oath to return to anormal state of consciousness at the end of their meditative sessions. Then, evenif they were not inclined to return, they would be bound by their oath.All texts on Jewish meditation stress that the person embarking on moreadvanced forms of meditation should ɹrst develop a strong internal discipline.This is very important, since higher states of consciousness are very enticing and"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"it is possible to lose one’s sense of reality. However, if a person is in control ofhis actions and emotions in general, he will also remain in control of his sense ofreality. Rather than negate his life, his meditative experiences will enhance it.It is in this context that a common folk saying states that people who studyKabbalah go mad. This obviously does not mean the academic study ofKabbalah; although Kabbalah is a diɽcult intellectual discipline, it is no moredangerous than any other study. However, involvement in the more esotericforms of Kabbalistic meditation can be dangerous to mental health, especially ifthe meditator proceeds without adequate preparation.In a sense, it is like climbing a mountain. Even for an experienced climber,there is always an element of danger. If a person had limited experience, hewould not even think of climbing a diɽcult mountain without a guide; to do sowould be to court disaster. The same is true of one who tries the more esotericforms of meditation without proper training and discipline.The forms of meditation presented in this book are not dangerous mountains.Rather, they are gentle hills, which are safe to climb, but from which one cansee wide vistas."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"5JEWISH MEDITATIONIn the previous chapters, we have discussed the discipline of meditation ingeneral. Before we can understand Jewish meditation, we must ɹrst have a goodidea of the nature of meditation in its broadest sense. The phenomenology andpsychology of Jewish meditation are not particularly diʃerent from those ofother systems. The goals and results, however, are often very different.There is ample evidence that meditative practices were widespread amongJews throughout Jewish history. References to meditation are found in majorJewish texts in every period from the biblical to the premodern era. One reasonthat this has not been universally recognized is that the vocabulary ofmeditation has been lost to a large degree, especially during the last century.Until the rise of the Jewish Enlightenment, mysticism and intellectualism hadequal status within Judaism. The ostensible goal of the Enlightenment, however,was to raise the intellectual level of Judaism, and positive as this may havebeen, it was often done at the expense of other Jewish values. The ɹrst valuesto fall by the wayside were Jewish mysticism in general and meditation inparticular. Anything that touched upon the mystical was denigrated assuperstition and occultism and was deemed unworthy of serious study.Even Kabbalah, which contains mysticism par excellence, was reduced tosimply an intellectual exercise; its deeper meanings were totally lost. In earlierchapters we discussed how many phenomena experienced in a meditative statecannot be understood rationally. This premise was not recognized by thenineteenth-century rationalists, and even the ineʃable became the subject ofphilosophical discussion.For this and other reasons, all references to meditation vanished frommainstream Jewish literature about 150 years ago. This is true even in Chasidicliterature, where meditation initially played a central role. Because of thisantimystical trend, even Kabbalistic works published after around 1840 show asurprising lack of even the slightest mention of meditation. After a century ofindifference, even the meanings of key words were forgotten."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In earlier literature, by contrast, references to meditation are abundant. Thisis true even in the Bible, although one has to resort to a kind of “verbalarchaeology” to discover the true meaning of key words.In any case, it appears from both biblical and postbiblical sources thatmeditation was central to the prophetic experience, and that this experience wasattained in the meditative state. The Bible states explicitly that the prophetsused chants and music to attain higher states of consciousness. Carefulphilological analysis of certain key words in the Bible suggests that they refer tospeciɹc meditative methods. This subject formed the basis of my ɹrst book onthe subject, Meditation and the Bible. However, since the discussion consistslargely of analysis of Hebrew words, it is beyond the scope of this book.From the literature, it seems evident that a prophet would almost alwaysexperience his ɹrst prophetic experience while in a meditative state. Later,however, it would become possible for him to experience prophecy withoutmeditation. Sometimes prophecy would come to a prophet unexpectedly andwithout warning. This probably involved a phenomenon sometimes referred toas “ɻashback.” After a person has become adept at reaching higher levels ofconsciousness through meditation, he can occasionally reach such levelsspontaneously as well. This seems to be evident in the experiences of a numberof prophets.There is also evidence that during the period when the Bible was written(until approximately 400 B.C.E.), meditation was practiced by a large proportionof the Israelite people. The Talmud and Midrash state explicitly that over amillion people were involved in such disciplines. Regular schools of meditationexisted, led by master prophets. The master prophets, in turn, were under theleadership of the primary prophets, the ones actually quoted in the Bible. Inthese schools, people were taught meditative methods in order to attain acloseness to God; as a side eʃect of such meditation, prophecy was alsosometimes achieved.Since nonprophets may have been practicing meditators, they would alsoexperience spontaneous prophecy or visions, without actually meditating. Thiswould explain the biblical accounts of individuals who had prophetic visionseven though they were not meditating and had no prior prophetic experience.When a person engages in meditation on a regular basis, he can reach meditativestates of consciousness spontaneously, without meditation, and these states cancause him to experience visions.Everything found in later literature seems to indicate that these meditativeschools required a strong discipline and faithful adherence to a strict regimen."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The schools were extremely demanding, and were open only to those willing todevote themselves totally. Before even being admitted to one of these ancientmeditative schools, a person had to be not only spiritually advanced but incomplete control of all his emotions and feelings. Beyond that, the disciplines ofthe Torah and commandments were central to these schools, and thesedisciplines required a degree of self-mastery to which not everyone could aspire.It appears that this was one of the attractions of ancient idolatry. While theJewish meditative schools required extensive discipline and preparation, manyidolatrous schools of mysticism and meditation were open to all. A person couldat least think that he was having a transcendental experience, without adheringto the tight discipline of Torah and Judaism. It was very much like the situationtoday, when Eastern meditative groups seem easier to relate to than the strictdiscipline of Judaism.For anyone who has ever had a taste of the transcendental, it can be aninɹnitely sweet experience, more pleasurable than love or sex. For manypeople, it was an experience after which they would actually lust. When theTalmud speaks of the “lust for idolatry,” it could be speaking of the magneticattraction that this spiritual experience had for people. If they could not get itfrom Israelite sources, they would seek it in idolatrous rites.As long as the Israelites were in their homeland, the situation was more orless under control. Idolatry may have been a strong temptation, but theprophetic mystical schools were strong enough to unite the people and preventthem from assimilating. Even if individuals or groups backslid, they couldalways be drawn back into the fold. In sum, during the entire FirstCommonwealth, meditation and mysticism played a central role in Judaism; thespiritual leaders were the prophets, the individuals who were most advancedspiritually.All this changed with the diaspora, which scattered Jews all over the world. Itwas realized that if the masses remained involved in prophetic mysticism, thetemptations drawing them to idolatry would ultimately alienate them from theTorah. Isolated, widely scattered groups would be ready prey to false teachersand experiences. Therefore, around this time, the more advanced forms ofmeditation were hidden from the masses and made part of a secret teaching.Now only the most qualiɹed individuals would be party to the secrets ofadvanced prophetic meditation.One of the last of the great prophets was Ezekiel, who lived in Babylonia rightat the beginning of the Exile. The ɹrst chapter of the Book of Ezekiel is one ofthe most mysterious parts of the entire Bible. In it, the prophet describes his"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"visions of angels and the Divine Throne in extraordinary detail. According to onetradition, this vision contained the keys to prophetic meditation and, ifunderstood, could serve as a guide to attaining prophecy. The study of thischapter became known as the “discipline of the chariot” (maaseh merkavah). Themethodology was there, but without the key it could not be understood.By the time of the rebuilding of the Second Temple, and the establishment ofthe Second Commonwealth, the Jewish leadership was clearly aware of thedangers that chariot meditation posed if it were made available to the masses.First, without adequate teachers and masters, Jews living in the diaspora wouldpervert the methods or use them for the wrong ends. This in turn could lead tothe splintering of Judaism into rival sects or to the establishment of religionsalien to Judaism. The net result would be the disuniɹcation of the Jewishpeople.Second, as discussed earlier, Jewish meditation was an extremely diɽcultdiscipline, which required years of preparation. If it were an accepted part ofJudaism, it was feared that Jews would become frustrated by the diɽculties ofpracticing it and be tempted to try non-Jewish forms of meditation. This, inturn, could lead them to idolatry and assimilation. Idolatry had been enough ofa problem during the First Commonwealth, when all the Israelites were in theirhomeland; now, in the diaspora, there was a distinct danger that it would leadto the destruction of the entire nation.Therefore, the Jewish leadership made a very diɽcult decision. The beneɹtsof having the masses involved in the highest types of meditation were weighedagainst the dangers. Although the nation might lose a degree of spirituality as aresult of the decision, it would at least survive. Henceforth, the discipline of thechariot had to be made into a secret doctrine, taught only to the most selectindividuals. The Great Assembly, which represented the ɹrst Jewish leadershipin the Second Commonwealth, thus decreed: “The discipline of the chariot maybe taught only to individual students (one at a time), and they must be wise,understanding with their own knowledge.”The Great Assembly also realized that the general populace would need ameditative discipline. But rather than have it be something loose andunstructured, they needed a discipline with a structure common to the entireJewish nation, one that would serve as a means of uniting the people. It wouldhave to contain the hopes and aspirations of the nation as a whole, to reinforcethe unity of the Jewish people.The meditative discipline that was composed by the Great Assembly ended upas the Amidah, a “standing” prayer consisting of eighteen sections, which would"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"be repeated silently, in an upright position, three times each day. It is true thatnowadays the Amidah is thought of more as a prayer than a meditative device,but the most ancient sources regard it as a meditation. Indeed, the Talmudverifies that this was its original intention.This also explains why the Great Assembly legislated that the same prayer berepeated three times each day. People often complain that saying the sameprayer over and over is tedious and uninspiring. For anyone familiar withmantra meditation, however, the opposite is true. All types of mantrameditation involve repetition. In mantra meditation, the device repeated is aword or a phrase, and it can be repeated over and over for weeks, months, oreven years on end.The Amidah was meant to be repeated three times every day from childhoodon, and essentially the same formula would be said for an entire lifetime. TheAmidah could therefore be looked upon as one long mantra. In many ways, ithas the same eʃects as a mantra, lifting the individual to a high meditative levelof consciousness. As we shall, there is an entire literature that describes how theAmidah can be used in this manner. But most important, there is ample evidencethat it was originally composed as the common form of meditation to be used bythe entire Jewish nation.From Talmudic times through the Middle Ages, an extensive literature dealingwith Jewish meditation was written. Virtually every method found in generalmeditation can be found in ancient Jewish texts, as well as a number of methodsthat are found nowhere else. Indeed, a comparative study of meditative methodsshows that the Jewish systems may have been among the most advanced in theworld.The Talmud speaks at length of meditation and meditative experiences,referring to it as the discipline of the chariot or “entering Paradise.” There arenumerous anecdotes about Talmudic sages, such as Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkaiand Rabbi Akiva, engaging in these practices. The Talmud also says that the“original saints” (chasidim rishonim) spent an hour reciting the Amidah; thecontext shows that it is speaking of a meditative rather than a worshipexperience. However, since meditation had become a secret doctrine withinJudaism by Talmudic times, everything is couched in allusion and allegory. Onlyto one who is aware of the methods do the accounts even begin to make sense.There were two major works on meditation that were most probablypublished during the Talmudic period (around 100-500 C.E.). The ɹrst is the SeferYetzirah, the Book of Creation. This is the most enigmatic text on Jewishmysticism. Over a hundred commentaries have been written on this text in an"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"eʃort to unravel its mysteries, but they all tend to read their own systems intothe text rather than extract its message. Careful analysis of the text, however,shows it to be an extremely advanced work on meditation.Another important text from this period is Heykhaloth Rabbatai (Greater Bookof the [Divine] Chambers). This is a primary text on merkavah mysticism, whichdescribes some of the techniques used in the discipline of the chariot. This workis fairly explicit, but even here, unless one is familiar with meditativetechniques, the text is largely opaque.In the Middle Ages, meditation was a well-known technique and was discussedat length by the Jewish philosophers, especially in connection with prophecy.Such Jewish philosophers as Maimonides and Gersonides analyzed themeditative state in depth, contrasting the visions that one has in a meditativestate with those in a dream state. The way it is discussed suggests thatmeditation was considered an integral part of Judaism.Among Jewish mystics and Kabbalists, it was evident that meditation played akey role. A great deal was written during this period about experiences that onecould have in the meditative state and how one’s vision and state of consciouscould be altered. Techniques were alluded to, but always in veiled hints, as ifthis teaching was bound to remain an oral tradition, never be put in writing.With one exception, we are left with tantalizing allusions, but no clear facts.The one individual who broke the rule of secrecy was Abraham Abulafia(1240-1296). He was a highly controversial ɹgure for many reasons, not theleast being the fact that he felt he was destined to be either a messianic ɹgure ora harbinger of the Messiah. But, as he states explicitly in his works, he was theɹrst to put the methods of Kabbalah meditation into writing. Although he wascriticized in his time, later Kabbalists recognized that the methods he describesrepresent the true tradition of prophetic Kabbalism.Soon after Abulaɹa’s time an event was to occur that would eclipsemeditation as the focus of Kabbalah. This was the publication of the Zohar in the1290s. Although this mystical work contains many allusions to meditativemethods, it does not speak explicitly about meditation. But the spiritual systemsdescribed by the Zohar are so complex that it would take a lifetime tounderstand them—and this is exactly what happened.With the publication of the Zohar, Kabbalah entered a new era. Besidesreaching mystical states and higher states of consciousness, Kabbalists now had anew goal, namely to understand the Zohar. This made Kabbalah into anacademic discipline as well as a mystical one. One begins to ɹnd more and morebooks published on Kabbalah that regard it as a philosophy rather than as an"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"experience. Indeed, by the ɹfteenth century, it was virtually impossible to writea book on Jewish philosophy without referring to the Kabbalah.The mystical element, however, was still very important. Kabbalah studyreached its zenith in the famed community of Safed, the city of saints andmystics. Foremost among the Safed Kabbalists was Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-1572), usually referred to as the Ari. He was so spiritually sensitive that hebecame a legend in his own lifetime, but his main accomplishment was the vastbody of Kabbalistic literature that he bequeathed to the world. The Ariunraveled the mystery of the Zohar, showing how its system could form thebasis of a meditative discipline. Beyond that, he left a system of Kabbalah that isone of the most complex intellectual systems devised by man.This, in turn, had the eʃect of further intellectualizing Kabbalah, making themystical realm every bit as stimulating and fascinating as philosophy or Talmud.Thus, Kabbalah gained status as an intellectual discipline in its own right. Theworks of Kabbalists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries took their placeas some of the most profound, complex, and challenging Judaic works everwritten. But this phenomenon also had the eʃect of reducing the importance ofmeditation, even among Jewish mystics. For many, Jewish mysticism andKabbalah had become an intellectual exercise and nothing more.There was yet another inɻuence that downgraded the importance of Kabbalahin this period. This was the reaction to the false messiah, Sabbatai Zvi (1626-1676). This charismatic individual twisted the teachings of Kabbalah and used itto support his warped messianic claims. His career ended when he waschallenged by the Turkish sultan; he chose to convert to Islam rather than suʃermartyrdom, leaving thousands of his followers totally disillusioned. The falsemessiah gave mysticism a bad name and brought about the eclipse of Jewishmysticism and meditation for almost a century.A renaissance of Jewish mysticism occurred in the middle of the eighteenthcentury under the leadership of the famed Rabbi Israel, known as the Baal ShemTov (1698-1760). The Chasidic movement, which he founded, was based onmysticism, and meditative exercises were central to the movement. Animportant early Chasidic technique involved using the daily service as ameditative exercise. Not only did the Chasidic movement bring meditation backinto Judaism, but it infused the Jewish community with new energy andcommitment as well.Still, the established Jewish community saw the embryonic Chasidicmovement as a threat. Since it had adopted unique and distinctive practices,many Jewish leaders felt that the movement could become a cult. It was also"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"felt that the movement was too closely associated with a single personality, atrait reminiscent of the Sabbatai Zvi ɹasco. A powerful opposition to Chasidismarose, going so far as to excommunicate the entire movement. Leadingrabbinical sages throughout Europe were marshaled to express their oppositionto the movement in the strongest terms.This, in turn, had its eʃect on the Chasidic movement. Some elements of thismovement took a road that had been traveled earlier, reducing all its mysticalteachings to philosophy. Others chose to institutionalize the role of spiritualmaster, making allegiance to a master (or rebbe) the main distinguishing featureof Chasidism.During the ɹrst three generations of Chasidism, there was hardly a publishedwork on the subject that did not contain some mention of meditation and themystical experience. In later works, however, mysticism is notably lacking.Indeed, in many areas, after 1850, the Chasidic movement developed a strongantimystical trend. Thus, one of the last bastions of Jewish meditation fell, andthe entire practice was forgotten for over a century. Even the basic vocabularyof meditation seemed to have been lost. Scholars wrote about Jewish mysticismbut ignored blatant references to meditation; key words for meditation wereeither mistranslated or misinterpreted. A situation arose in which meditationwas virtually erased from the Jewish consciousness and obliterated from Jewishhistory.At this point it would be useful to discuss the most common terms formeditation found in Jewish texts. Since all of these texts were written inHebrew, the key words are also in that language. From their roots and form,considerable insight can be obtained into the types of meditation that theysignify.The most common word for meditation in Judaic literature is kavanah. Thisword is translated as “concentration” or “feeling” or “devotion.” In context, theliterature speaks of worshiping with kavanah or maintaining kavanah whileperforming a sacred act. However, looking at the origin of the word kavanah, weimmediately see that it comes from the Hebrew root kaven, which means “toaim.” Therefore, kavanah denotes “aiming” consciousness toward a certain goal.The most apt translation is “directed consciousness.”Earlier, we deɹned meditation as controlled thinking. In this sense, kavanahwould be the most generic Hebrew term for meditation.The word kavanah is most often used in relation to prayer or worship. InJudaism, as we shall see, the line between worship and meditation is often avery ɹne one. Many elements of the worship service are speciɹcally designed to"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"be used as meditations, to reacher higher states of consciousness. We havediscussed this usage with regard to the Amidah, but it is also true of a number ofother prayers.When one has kavanah in worship, one is allowing the words of the service todirect one’s consciousness. The mind is brought to the state of consciousnessdeɹned by the prayer one is reciting. In this respect, the prayer is used to directthe consciousness.The word kavanah is also associated with various actions, especially thoseinvolving fulɹllment of the commandments or rituals. Here, too, kavanahdenotes clearing the mind of extraneous thought and concentrating totally on theaction at hand. The act itself becomes the means through which the person’sconsciousness is directed.In addition to the general concept of kavanah, various Jewish devotionalworks, especially those of a Kabbalistic nature, contain collections of speciɹckavanah meditations, or kavanoth, for various rituals. These kavanoth are used todirect the mind along the inner paths deɹned by the esoteric meaning of theritual.Another important Hebrew term associated with meditation is hitbonenuth.Translated literally, this word means “self-understanding.” It reɻects asomewhat different type of meditation.Normally, we look at things dispassionately and objectively. I may look at aleaf and even examine it very closely, but it does not aʃect me in any way. I amexactly the same person after as I was before. It does not change my state ofconsciousness at all. My mind is the same looking at the leaf as it would beotherwise.However, I may also look at the leaf with the aim of using it to attain a higherlevel of consciousness or a greater degree of self-awareness. I would then beusing the leaf as a means to achieve “self-understanding,” or hitbonenuth.The great Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) speaks aboutusing hitbonenuth meditation while contemplating God’s creation. One canachieve a profound love for God through such contemplation. This is eʃectiveprecisely because it is not merely a simple contemplation of various aspects ofGod’s creation, but is understanding oneself as part of this creation. When onesees God’s creation, and understands one’s own role as part of it, one candevelop a deep and lasting love for God. Who has not gone out into the ɹelds ona clear night and gazed at the stars, yearning to unlock their secret? One thinksabout the vast, unfathomable reaches of the universe and stands in rapt awe. Formany people, this in itself can be a “religious experience.” It is an experience"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"that can bring a person to feel a profound humility before the inɹnite vastnessof the universe.The next step is to go beyond the physical and contemplate the fact that thisvast universe, with all its countless stars and galaxies, was all created by God.One ponders the fact that one ineʃable Being created everything. We realizehow different this Being must be from us, and yet we feel a certain closeness.The ɹnal step is hitbonenuth, understanding oneself in the light of this vastcreation. At this level, one asks the questions, “If God created this vast universe,then who am I? How do I ɹt into all of this?” At the same time, one may feelprivileged that God allows us to have a direct relationship with Him. Imaginethat the creator of all the stars and galaxies deigns to listen to me! Not only that,but He is concerned about me! Realizing God’s greatness, and at the same timecontemplating the closeness to Him that He allows us to enjoy, is precisely whatcan bring a person to profound love for God.The Psalmist expressed this when he said, “I look at Your heavens, the workof Your ɹngers, the moon and stars that You have established. What is man thatYou remember him, a son of Adam that You even consider him? Yet, You havemade him a little less than divine, You have adorned him with glory and honor.You made him master over all Your creatures and placed everything under hisfeet” (Ps. 8:4-6). We realize how insigniɹcant we should be in God’s eyes, andyet how significant we really are.Hitbonenuth meditation can be focused on anything—a stone, a leaf, a ɻower,or an idea. One allows the subject to ɹll the mind and then uses it as a means tounderstand the self. It is a type of mirror in which one can see oneself in thelight of true Reality. Using this mirror, one can see the Divine within oneself.Indeed, this may be the “mirror [aspaklaria] of prophecy” described in theTalmud. When one looks into this mirror and sees the Divine within oneself, onecan also communicate with the Divine.The ɹnal important Hebrew word for meditation is hitbodeduth. This is themost speciɹc term for meditation and one that was used as early as the tenthcentury. Literally, the word means “self-isolation,” and for this reason, the termescaped the notice of many students of Jewish mysticism. Many scholars havetranslated hitbodeduth simply as “seclusion” or “isolation,” not realizing that itrefers to meditation.The key to this term is to be found in a text by Moses Maimonides’ son,Abraham. He writes that there are two types of isolation, external self-isolationand internal self-isolation. External self-isolation simply involves being alonephysically—going oʃ to ɹelds, woods, or caves, anywhere away from other"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"people. This, however, is only the ɹrst step; external self-isolation is thedoorway to internal self-isolation.Internal self-isolation consists in isolating the mind from all outward sensationand then even from thought itself. From what one reads in most non-Jewishclassical texts, this is what is usually deɹned as the meditative state. Therefore,hitbodeduth is the Hebrew term for any practice that brings a person into themeditative state. It is a state in which the mind is isolated, standing alone,without any sensation or thought.It is known that sensory deprivation can help a person attain higher states ofconsciousness. Indeed, there are places in large cities where a person can buytime in a sensory deprivation chamber. In such a perfectly dark, soundproofchamber, one ɻoats in a dense liquid at body temperature. Cut oʃ completelyfrom all outward stimuli, the mind can go oʃ totally on its own and ɻoattoward higher states of consciousness.True meditation, however, does not require a sensory deprivation chamber.Rather, by using a meditative practice, one can blank out all outside stimuli atwill. At the same time, one also blanks out all extraneous thought, ɹlling themind with the subject of one’s meditation. This is hitbodeduth, self-isolation in ameditative sense.Vocabulary is very important, since without it one can read a Hebrewmeditative text and not even be aware of the nature of the subject. One reasonthat people were unaware of the importance and inɻuence of meditation inJudaism is that they were incorrectly translating key words in the mostimportant texts.The general impression one gains from studying these texts is not only thatmeditation was practiced by Jews, but that for quite a number of centuries itwas a very important ingredient of Judaism. Clearly, Jewish meditation hasbeen part and parcel of Judaism throughout the ages."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"6MANTRA MEDITATIONThe best-known form of meditation today is mantra meditation. The word“mantra” is an Eastern term denoting a word or phrase that is repeated over andover as a meditative exercise. In many types of Eastern meditation, mantrameditation is the central exercise, and it forms virtually the entire basis ofTranscendental Meditation. Since there is no adequate generic Western term forthis type of meditation, I shall use the Eastern term “mantra.”One immediate eʃect of mantra meditation is to relax the body. In this formof meditation, it seems that the more the body relaxes, the more active the mindbecomes. It is as if energy is released by the body, which can be used by themind.In any case, meditation, especially using a mantra, is an excellent relaxationmethod. For this reason, a number of psychologists have developed religiouslyneutral forms of mantra meditation to elicit the “relaxation response.” An entiresystem called Standardized Clinical Meditation (SCM) has been developed toutilize this form of meditation in a clinical context.Mantra meditation most probably works largely through habituation. If aperson is in a room all day with, say, a loudly ticking clock, his mind eventuallyturns oʃ the sound of the ticking. Although he hears the ticking, it simply doesnot register. The person is said to have become habituated to the ticking sound,so that he no longer pays attention to it. This is an important mechanismthrough which the mind ɹlters out the commonplace and allows the thinker toconcentrate on what is important.When one repeats a mantra over and over, the mind also becomes habituatedto it. Eventually, one becomes able to say it without the words registering in theconscious mind. By this time, one has also formed the habit of erasing allthought from the mind while reciting the mantra. It is therefore a highlyeffective psychological means of removing all thought from the mind.This may seem quite mundane and nonmystical. However, the mantra doesnot necessarily have to be the mystical element in the meditation. The mantra"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"can serve as a means of clearing the mind of mundane thought, leaving it opento other, transcendental experiences. This can be true no matter hownonmystical the mantra is. Indeed, in certain types of clinical meditation, anonsense word can be used as the mantra.Nevertheless, if the mantra has spiritual power in its own right, it not onlyclears the mind of mundane thought, but also puts the meditator into a specialspiritual space. The form of the mantra can be extremely important if onewishes to accomplish a specific spiritual goal in one’s meditation.Although mantra meditation is not the most typical Jewish form ofmeditation, it is one of the simplest. As in general meditation, it consists inrepeating a word or a phrase over and over, usually for a period of half an houreach day. The most important element of the meditation is that it be done dailyand that there be a commitment to continue the practice for a period of at leasta month. It usually takes between thirty and forty days for the results of thistype of meditation to become manifest.There appear to be references to mantra meditation even in the Bible. On thebasis of philological analysis, it seems that the Hebrew verb hagah denotes akind of meditation in which a word or sound is repeated over and over. Thegreat Hebrew linguist David Kimchi (1160-1235) writes that the word hagahdenotes a sound or a thought that is repeated like the cooing of a dove or thegrowling of a lion. Nevertheless, the biblical references to this type ofmeditation are ambiguous and not clearly stated.The earliest unambiguous reference to a mantra type of meditation is found inHeykhaloth Rabbatai, the primary text of Merkavah mysticism, dating fromTalmudic times. The text presents a mystical “name” of God, which is actually arather long phrase consisting of a number of mystical words or names. Theinstruction says that this phrase must be repeated 120 times, again and again.The technique is reminiscent of mantra meditation, especially in some Easternsystems in which the mantra is repeated for a set number of times.It is signiɹcant that in the Heykhaloth, the mantra is seen not as an end initself, but rather as the ɹrst step in the discipline of the chariot. The mantra wasused to bring the initiate into a state of consciousness from which he couldtravel from chamber to chamber in the supernal worlds. Thus, rather than definethe state of consciousness, the mantra brought the individual into the ɹrst stageof the meditative state, from which he could use other techniques to progressfurther.In later Kabbalistic schools, it appears that biblical verses or selections fromthe Talmud or Zohar would be used as mantras. In sixteenth-century Safed, for"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"example, there is mention of a technique known as gerushin, which appears toconsist in repeating a biblical verse over and over as a sort of mantra. Besidesbringing the meditator into a higher state of consciousness, the purpose of thistechnique was to provide him with deeper insight into the verse itself. As herepeated the verse, it would eventually appear as if the verse itself were tellingthe initiate its meaning. Rather than studying or analyzing the verse, themeditator would then be communing with it.This concept is even more graphically illustrated in a technique used by RabbiJoseph Caro (1488-1575) and his followers. Instead of using a biblical verse, thistechnique made use of a selection from the Mishnah, the earliest portion of theTalmud, completed around 200 C.E. A portion of the Mishnah (a particularparagraph or mishnah) would be repeated as a mantra, leading to a state ofconsciousness in which a maggid, an angelic being associated with the mishnah,would speak to the meditator. Again, the meditator would gain deep insights,not from studying or analyzing the mishnah, but by experiencing its spiritualessence.It is signiɹcant that there may be an allusion to this technique in the Talmuditself. The Talmud speaks of reviewing a mishnah and says, “Repeating one’smishnah one hundred times is not the same as repeating it one hundred and onetimes.”There may be an allusion in this teaching that even in Talmudic times,the Mishnah was used as a type of mantra.There is also evidence that the Ari (Rabbi Isaac Luria) made use of a similartechnique with the Zohar. Unlike other Kabba lists of his time, who analyzed theZohar and tried to probe its mysteries intellectually, the Ari probed its depths bymeans of a meditative technique. Judging by the description of his technique, heseems to have used a short selection of the Zohar as a mantra, repeating it overand over until its meaning became clear. The Ari describes this experience bysaying that the Zohar “spoke to him.”In relatively modern times, a practical form of mantra meditation wasprescribed by the noted Chasidic leader Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav (1772-1811). Of all the Chasidic masters, none spoke of hitbodeduth meditation moreoften than he. As we shall see, his main technique consisted in engaging inconversations with God. Nevertheless, Rabbi Nachman said that if a person doesnot known what to say, he should simply repeat the phrase Ribbono shel Olam,which is Hebrew for “Master of the Universe.” From the description of thetechnique, it seems obvious that Rabbi Nachman was prescribing the use of thisphrase as a mantra to bring a person into a higher state of consciousness.Here, too, Rabbi Nachman did not regard repeating the mantra as an end in"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"itself. Rather, he saw it as a way of opening the mind in order to enter intoconversation with God, a method that he maintained was the best way to getclose to God. Still, he saw repetition as an important technique in its own right.Since the phrase Ribbono shel Olam was prescribed as a mantralike device byRabbi Nachman, some people refer to it as Rabbi Nachman’s mantra. Some, forthe sake of authenticity, prefer the Chasidic pronunciation, Ribboinoi shelOylawm. In any case, it is an ideal phrase for anyone who wants to engage in anauthentic Jewish mantra meditation. Not only was it prescribed by one of thegreat Chasidic masters, but the phrase itself was used as an introduction toprayer as far back as early Talmudic times. The expression Ribbono shel Olamwas used as early as the ɹrst century B.C.E. by Simeon ben Shetach, and accordingto the Talmud, it was also in use in biblical times.Mantra meditation is one of the simplest types of meditation. It is therefore agood place to begin if you wish to embark on a program of meditation. RabbiNachman’s mantra, Ribbono shel Olam, is a good one with which to start. It alsoprovides an excellent example of meditation in general.You cannot begin a program of meditation without a certain degree ofcommitment. In order for it to have an eʃect, you must do it on a daily basis,spending at least twenty or thirty minutes repeating the mantra. If you do itevery day, the eʃects become cumulative. However, when you miss or skipdays, the cumulative eʃect is lost. Furthermore, it takes several weeks ofdiscipline with a mantra to attain a full level of a higher state of consciousness.Some eʃects may be manifest immediately, but it takes a few weeks before youexperience the full eʃects. If you have the commitment, the results can bestriking.At this point, a word of warning is in order. Mantra meditation is a fairly safemethod for most people, but it can be dangerous for someone with a history ofmental illness. If a person’s connection to the real world is not strong to beginwith, he may have diɽculty reestablishing his connection with reality after adeep meditative experience. Just as certain forms of strenuous exercise must beavoided by people with a history of heart trouble, certain forms of mentalexercise should be avoided by people with a history of mental illness. TheTalmudic story of Ben Zoma, who lost his mind after a particularly intensemeditative experience, serves as a warning. Any person with doubts about hismental stability should make sure that he has an expert guide before becominginvolved with any type of intense meditation.In general, the preparations for meditation are straightforward and simple.You should meditate in a time and place where you will not be interrupted or"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"disturbed by people, phone calls, or noise. Rabbi Nachman said that it was bestto have a special room for meditation if possible. Since this is a luxury that fewcan aʃord, you may choose a special corner of the house, a special chair, or aroom where you can be alone at night when no one else is about. RabbiNachman also said that woods, hills, and ɹelds are good places to meditate,especially when the weather is comfortable.But the place is not important, as long as it is an environment where you willnot be interrupted. You can even meditate under the covers in bed at night, if itis a place where you know you will not be disturbed, and Rabbi Nachmanpresents this as a viable alternative. An excellent place, if available, would alsobe the synagogue when no one is around to disturb the meditative session.Many people associate meditation with the Eastern lotus position. However,we should remember that in the East it was common to sit on the ɻoor or on amat, so that the lotus position was close to the normal, comfortable sittingposition for Eastern meditators. For Westerners, this position is diɽcult to learnand is initially quite uncomfortable. In practice, it is found that sitting in acomfortable straight-backed chair is just as effective.In any case, this is of little relevance to Jewish meditation, since the systemsdo not prescribe any special position. It is true that there are references tositting in a chair, but they are only meant as a suggestion. You may choose anyposition in which you can remain comfortable for a long period of time withoutmoving the body or being subject to cramping.During meditation, sit with the eyes lightly closed, totally relaxed. Your handscan rest comfortably on the table or on your lap. Your ɹngers should not beclasped or intertwined, as the Kabbalists teach that this should be avoided.Rather, if your hands are together, one should rest lightly on the other.Before beginning a meditation, settle yourself in the place. This means sittingquietly in the place where you will be meditating, ɹtting into it and makingyourself at ease. During this period, try to relax completely, clearing your mindof all extraneous concerns. Some people ɹnd it helpful to hum a relaxing melodyduring these preparatory moments. This period should last between ɹve and tenminutes.In this respect, the advantage of meditating in the same place every daybecomes clear. You will come to associate that place with the serene mooddeveloped during meditation, and after a few days, the calmness comesautomatically as soon as you sit down in your meditation place. This tends toreinforce the process and make it easier to advance.Let us assume that you are using Rabbi Nachman’s mantra, Ribbono shel Olam."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Repeat the phrase over and over, slowly, in a very soft voice. The meditativenorm is that it should be said in the softest voice that you can comfortablypronounce. You can either whisper it or vocalize it softly, whichever is morecomfortable to you.There are no ɹrm standards regarding this in Jewish meditation. Some peopleɹnd it easier to whisper the mantra. It is also permissible to mouth it withoutvoicing it at all. It is not recommended, however, that it merely be thought inthe mind, at least for beginners. If the mantra is repeated mentally, without atleast mouthing it, it can be interrupted by extraneous thoughts.Therefore, one should not place too much emphasis on how the mantra issaid, as long as it is said for the designated time. This usually consists of aperiod between twenty minutes and a half hour, as mentioned earlier. If youwish, you may use a silent timer to signal when the meditation period is over.This is preferable to looking at a clock, which takes the mind oʃ the meditation.You can also have someone else signal you when the time is up. After a while,however, you will automatically know when the period of meditation is over.At ɹrst, you may allow the mind to wander freely while reciting the mantra.As long as you have an inner awareness that the words Ribbono shel Olam denote“Master of the Universe,” the words themselves will pull your thoughts in ameaningful direction. No matter where the thoughts lead, there is no cause forconcern. A Chasidic teaching says that any thought that enters the mind duringmeditation does so for a purpose.It is also instructive to pay attention to the visual images you see whilemeditating with the eyes closed. As you become more advanced, these imagesbecome clearer and more vivid, and it becomes much easier to focus on them.Beyond that, as days pass, your control over these images improves dramaticallyduring the meditative state. The vividness of these images can also becomespectacular.One must be careful, however, not to take these images too seriously. As oneadvances, the images become more explicit and can take the form of visions.The neophyte meditator may be tempted to place great signiɹcance on thesevisions, and think that he is actually experiencing prophecy or the like. It istherefore important to realize that any visions one may experience are notimportant and that undue emphasis should not be placed on them. Unless aperson is extremely advanced, it is assumed that any visions he experiences arecreations of the mind and nothing more.In the Kabbalah literature, there are warnings even to advanced meditatorsnot to give credence to visions. Even the most impressive visions can be"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"spurious and come from the Other Side. Indeed, acting on the basis of imagesseen while in a meditative state is considered to be extremely dangerous anddetrimental to one’s spiritual development. Therefore, when a personexperiences images or visions, they should be taken as aesthetic experiences andnothing more. At most, they should be taken as the ɹrst hints of a spiritualexperience.In general, bodily motion destroys concentration during mantra meditationand should be avoided. Some people, however, report that a slight, very slowswaying, perhaps a half inch in each direction, helps ease tension during theinitial stages. If you find this helpful, you may use it.At ɹrst, during meditation, you may allow the mind to wander freely orconcentrate on the images you see in your mind’s eye. However, as you becomemore advanced, you should begin to allow the words of the mantra to ɹll themind completely, blanking out all sensation. This involves keeping all otherthoughts out of the consciousness. All of your attention should be focused on thewords of the mantra, leaving no room for any other thought.Of course, until you become proɹcient in this discipline, extraneous thoughtswill constantly try to push their way into the mind. You must then gently pushthem out, forcing your concentration back to the words of the mantra. This cansometimes take considerable eʃort, but it is the means through which one gainscontrol of one’s thoughts.Some people ɹnd it easier to banish extraneous thoughts if they recite themantra very slowly. As we shall see, slowness is also used in other types ofmeditation. At other times, however, it may be preferable to recite the mantrarapidly, sometimes even racing through the words. Here again, each individualmust find his own pace.After the meditation is over, remain in place for approximately ɹve minutes,allowing the mind to absorb the eʃects of the meditation. You also need sometime to “come back down” before returning to your daily routine. Again, youmay wish to hum a soft melody during this period. It should be a time ofintimate closeness with the Divine.You may wish to use the moments following a meditation to have a shortconversation with God. As mentioned earlier, Rabbi Nachman saw mantrameditation primarily as a means of preparing for such a divine conversation,which he saw as a higher type of meditation. In any case, one can feel very closeto God after a meditation, and it is a good time to express that closeness.Whereas Eastern schools see mantra meditation as an end in itself, Jewishsources seem to indicate that it is more of a preparation for a deeper spiritual"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"experience.Some sources state that after meditating, one should smell fragrant spices orperfumes, so as to reinvolve oneself in the physical world. It is also prescribedthat some light food be eaten shortly afterward, since through the blessing, thefood can elevate the entire body.Of course, meditating on the phrase Ribbono shel Olam, “Master of theUniverse,” has great value in its own right, and some people may be content tomake it a lifetime practice. Others, however, may want to use it as a way tolearn meditative techniques and recognize higher states of consciousness, andthen go on to what are considered more advanced methods."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"7CONTEMPLATIONAnother simple type of meditation is contemplation. I have discussed this formof meditation in a previous chapter, in the context of hitbonenuth, but here Ishall discuss it in further detail and in practical terms.Contemplation consists in sitting and concentrating on an object, word, oridea, letting it ɹll the entire mind. This is an excellent introductory meditation,insofar as it does not require any background in meditation or any advancedknowledge of Hebrew or Judaism. The techniques are the same as those ofmantra meditation, except that the experience is visual rather than verbal.Simple contemplation consists of gazing at an object for a ɹxed period oftime. As in all forms of meditation, one should be as comfortable as possible.There is no need to avoid blinking the eyes, since this can lead to discomfort.Rather, one should sit and gaze at the object of contemplation in the mostrelaxed manner possible.The object of contemplation can be almost anything—a pretty stone, a leaf, aɻower, or written material. Pictures, images, and statues, however, are to beavoided, since contemplating them is dangerously close to idolatry.As in the case of mantra meditation, one should sit quietly in the meditationplace, adjusting to the space. The meditation itself should take between twentyand thirty minutes. After the meditation, one should remain still for ɹve to tenminutes, absorbing the effects of the exercise.Visual contemplation is valuable in many respects. I have spoken earlier ofvisualization, in which one creates images in the mind’s eye. Contemplation is avery good introduction to this practice. Once a person has learned to look at anobject correctly, he can also learn to control his vision. Contemplation engravesthe image in the mind’s eye, and this image can then be conjured up even whenthe object is not present.You can begin by using the object of contemplation as a focus for unstructuredmeditation. This would mean gazing at the object while letting the mind drift oʃin any direction it desires. The contemplation focuses the mind, but thought is"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"left unbridled. You can think about how to restructure your life, about themeaning of life, or about any other subject important to you. Rather than beingthe goal of meditation, contemplation is an adjunct to a meaningful unstructuredmeditation.As one becomes more advanced, one gradually learns how to ɹll the mindwith the visual image of the object of contemplation, banishing all otherthought. This is very much like mantra meditation, except that instead of ɹllingthe mind with a word or phrase, it is ɹlled with an image. Extraneous thoughtsare also shunted aside in a similar manner; whenever a thought enters the mind,it is gently pushed aside, leaving the entire attention ɹxed on the object ofcontemplation.At ɹrst one must make a conscious eʃort to rid the mind of extraneousthoughts. However, after a while, the object of contemplation becomes the totalcenter of one’s focus, and everything else seems to vanish. The experience oflooking at the object becomes highly intensiɹed. It is as if there were nothingelse in the entire world besides the meditator and the object of contemplation.When one reaches this state, every detail of the object assumes an importanceof its own. Thus, for example, if one were contemplating a leaf, every line andvein on it take on major signiɹcance. One would see structure and patterns towhich the mind would normally be oblivious. Every detail would become deeplyengraved in one’s consciousness.There is great leeway in what can be used as an object of meditation. Ifdesired, a diʃerent object can be used at each session. This is of necessity true ifthe object of contemplation is something perishable, such as a leaf or a ɻower.However, when a diʃerent object is used each time, the eʃects are notcumulative.It is therefore best to use the same object for a relatively long period of time.If possible the object should remain the same for thirty to forty days, longenough to habituate to it. Then, the experience of each session is reinforced, andeach day’s experience builds on that of the previous days.It is important, however, to realize that the object of contemplation is merelyan aid and not an end in itself. One must be extremely careful not to make theobject of contemplation into an object of devotion, since to do so would borderon idolatry. Even when one becomes aware of the Divine in the object, it maynot be made into a venerated object or an object of devotion. Since this isalways a danger, it is best to limit oneself to types of contemplation actuallymentioned in classical Judaic literature.People sometimes ask, if one can only do one type of meditation, whether one"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"should begin with mantra meditation or with contemplation. To a large degree,this is a matter of personal preference. Some people are more verbal, whileothers are more visually oriented. For one who is verbal, mantra meditation willwork more eʃectively, while one who is more visually oriented may ɹnd iteasier to ɹll the mind with visual contemplation. Of course, if a person has aspiritual master who knows his soul and psyche, then the master can help him tomake the decision.However, both mantra meditation and contemplation are meant to developdiʃerent areas of the mind and spirit. Therefore, both are important. There arealso important meditations that involve the senses of the body. For beginners,however, mantra meditation usually seems the simplest.Some people ɹnd it valuable to combine mantra meditation withcontemplation. If a person has learned to focus his mind through mantrameditation, then he can also use this method to enhance his contemplation. It isvery easy to ɹll the mind with a visual image when one is in a higher state ofconsciousness from mantra meditation. In this sense, mantra meditation can beseen as an excellent introduction to contemplation.Furthermore, as we have seen, the most universal Jewish mantra is theexpression Ribbono shel Olam, “Master of the Universe.” This mantra does notnegate physical reality but focuses our attention on the physical universe andmakes us aware of its Master. Thus, this mantra is an excellent way of relatingthe visible world to its Creator.There is a vast diʃerence between the English concept of universe and theHebrew concept. In English, the word “universe” comes from the Latin unus,meaning “one,” and versum, meaning “to turn.” Hence, “universe” denotes thatwhich is turned into one, or that which is combined into an integral whole.Thus, in the secular sense, the universe is seen as the main unifying factor increation.The Hebrew word for universe, on the other hand, is olam, which is derivedfrom the root alam, meaning “to conceal.” Therefore, in a Hebrew sense, theuniverse is seen as that which conceals the Divine. Thus, when one says Ribbonoshel Olam, denoting “Master of the Universe,” one is saying that concealedbehind the universe, there is a Master. Thus, in repeating this mantra, one ismaking oneself aware of the hidden reality behind the visible one.When a person uses the mantra Ribbono shel Olam together withcontemplation on a physical object, he can actually begin to see the Divinehidden in the object. He can make the object of contemplation into a linkbetween himself and God. The object becomes a channel through which he can"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"experience the Divine.Although any physical object can be used as the focus of meditation, severalare mentioned speciɹcally in Judaic literature, especially in the Kabbalah. Eachof these has an important significance in its own right.One type of meditation mentioned in the Zohar (1:1b, 2:231b) involvescontemplating the stars. The Zohar provides a biblical source for this type ofmeditation, from the verse, “Lift your eyes on high, and see who created these,the One who brings out their host by number, He calls them all by name ...”(Isa. 40:26). The verse is seen by the Zohar as prescribing a contemplationmeditation with the stars as its object.The Zohar notes that in the verse, there are two key Hebrew words, MI,meaning “who,” and ELeH, meaning “these.” When these two words arecombined, the Hebrew letters (capitalized here) spell out ELoHIM, the Hebrewname for God. Thus, when one looks at the “these”—things in the ordinarymundane world—and asks “who?”—who is the author and basis of these things?—one ɹnds God. The Zohar presents this in the context of the stars, but it is trueof any object of contemplation.People often gaze at the stars and feel a sense of awe and smallness in theface of the Inɹnite. But if one does it as a speciɹc meditation, contemplating thestars and removing all other thought from the mind, the sense of awe and thefeeling of God’s presence in creation are greatly enhanced. One’s focus goesbeyond the stars, seeking what is beyond them—the “who” behind the “these”—and one becomes aware of their Creator.A beginner may ɹnd it diɽcult to contemplate the stars in this mannerwithout becoming overwhelmed by extraneous thoughts. Therefore, a mantrasuch as Ribbono shel Olam can be extremely useful. As it were, one is looking atthe stars as concealing a greater and deeper truth, and the mind and soul probeand search to penetrate this mystery. When saying Ribbono shel Olam—“Lord ofthe Universe”—one is, as it were, calling to God in the depths of the heavens,seeking to ɹnd Him beyond the stars, beyond the very limits of time and space.This can bring a person to an overwhelmingly deep spiritual experience.There are other ways in which a mantralike device can be combined withcontemplation. Thus, for example, one may contemplate a ɻower and wish togain a greater awareness of its beauty. Contemplation itself, of course, willgreatly enhance awareness, but a beginner may ɹnd it diɽcult to maintainconcentration. However, the contemplation can be combined with an exercise inwhich one repeats the word “beauty” over and over while looking at the ɻower.This serves to amplify one’s sensitivity and sense of beauty, so that the ɻower"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"will actually appear to radiate beauty. The result can be an extremely powerfulaesthetic experience. If one then realizes that the source of beauty is the Divinein the flower, then this beauty can also become a link with the Divine.Similarly, one can gaze at one’s own hand and repeat the word “strength”over and over. When one does this, one can become uniquely aware of thestrength in one’s own hand. It is true that strength is normally an abstractquality, which one can be aware of but cannot see. However, in a meditativestate, the strength of one’s hand becomes not merely something of which one isaware in an abstract sense, but something that one can actually see. It isimpossible to describe what strength looks like, but it actually becomes visible.This is very much like a synesthesia experience, discussed earlier, in which onecan see unseeable things such as sounds or fragrances. Here, one can see abstractconcepts as well.Another type of contemplation mentioned in the Zohar involves a candle oroil lamp. Many meditative systems make use of a candle, but Judaic sourcesindicate a preference for a small lamp using olive oil and a linen wick. Thiswould be like the great menorah candelabrum that stood in the JerusalemTemple, which may have also been used as the object of contemplation. Oliveoil has a particularly pure white ɻame that draws the gazer into its depths. Ofcourse, if such a lamp is not available, a candle may be used instead, since themain thing is the flame.The Zoharic literature (Tikkunay ha-Zohar 21:50a) teaches that incontemplating a ɻame, one should be aware of its ɹve colors: white, yellow,red, black, and sky-blue. These are the colors that one should see when deeplycontemplating the flame of a candle or oil lamp.On an intellectual level, this is impossible to understand. When you simplylook at a ɻame, you may see white, yellow, and red, since these are the naturalcolors of fire. Even the black may not be that difficult to understand, since it canbe seen as the darkness around the ɻame. As we have seen, darkness itself playsan important role in the meditative experience.However, the sky-blue color appears to present diɽculty. There is noevidence whatever of this color in the ɻame of a candle or lamp. Furthermore,from the context of the Zoharic teaching, it appears that this color appearsoutside and beyond the black, which is the darkness around the flame.However, elsewhere, the Zohar (3:33a) provides a hint as to the nature of thissky-blue color. The Zohar says that the blue that one sees around the ɻamerepresents the Divine Presence, Shekhinah in Hebrew.In order to understand this, however, one must actually do a candle or lamp"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"meditation. It should be done in an otherwise dark room, with the candle farenough from the wall so that it casts no light on it. Again, one uses the standardcontemplation technique, allowing the ɻame to ɹll the entire mind. Onebecomes aware of the colors in the ɻame, the white, the yellow, and the red;each color and gradation of color is extremely signiɹcant. One is aware of theheat and energy radiating from the candle, and, as in the case of the hand’sstrength mentioned above, one reaches a level at which one can actually seethese abstract energies.The next step would be to concentrate on the darkness around the ɻame.When one contemplates the darkness of the room, it becomes a very profound,palpable darkness. One sees it as a velvety blackness that appears to radiatedarkness. This may be analogous to the “black ɹre” or “lamp of darkness”discussed in Talmudic and Zoharic literature. In this sense, experiencing thedarkness can be more profound than experiencing the light.However, when one gets deeper into the meditation, one will begin to see asky-blue ɹeld around the darkness. The blackness will extend for a certaindistance around the candle, but around this will be an experience of pure sky-blue. It will be the most beautiful sky-blue color imaginable, like that of asummer sky over the Holy Land. The color will have an almost awesomebeauty.Of course, the blue color is not a physical reality; it is entirely a creation ofthe mind. But according to the Zohar, the blue sensation is a revelation of thespiritual. In a sense, it denotes that one is seeing the spiritual essence of thelight that is radiating from the candle.There are sources that indicate that in more advanced meditative techniques,it is possible actually to see visions in this blue ɹeld (see Sefer Yetzirah 1:12).Furthermore, in conjunction with the revelation at Sinai, when the Israelites hada vision of the Divine, they saw “under His feet like a brickwork of sapphire”(Exod. 24:10). Similarly, when the prophet Ezekiel saw the Throne of Glory, hedescribed it as being the color of the sapphire (Ezek. 1:26). Thus, blue is alwaysa color associated with vision and prophecy.This type of candle meditation is important for a number of reasons. First, itgives us an experience of “black ɹre” and “radiating darkness,” both of whichare important concepts in Kabbalistic sources. As we shall see, “black ɹre” playsan important role in other types of Jewish meditation.Second, in learning how to see the blue aura around the candle, one can learnhow to see auras in general. An aura is a bluish ɹeld that appears around peopleand other objects. To see such an aura, one can begin by gazing at one’s hand"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"against a blank white wall or a clear blue sky. One will eventually seesomething like an area of color that somehow “feels” diʃerent than either theobject or the background. This blurred area of color appears to extend outwardfrom an eighth to a quarter of an inch from the object. At first it may be difficultto see, but with practice the aura becomes highly evident. Contemplationdramatically increases one’s ability to see it.In Kabbalistic sources, this aura is known as the tzelem. There were somespiritual masters, such as the Ari, who could determine the state of a person’sspiritual health on the basis of the aura. Of course, reading auras is a subjectthat is beyond the scope of this book.The color blue is also associated with the spiritual in other ways. One of theimportant commandments, involves the tassels that were once worn on thecorners of all garments. This survives today in the tallith, the tassled garmentworn for prayer. In ancient times, one thread of the tassels would be dyed abright sky-blue, using a dye made from the purpura snail (see Num. 15:38).Although it is no longer used, the blue was seen as highly significant.Thus, the Talmud provides us with a contemplation meditation on the bluethread of the tassel. It says:The tassel is blue;The blue is the color of the sea;The sea is the color of the sky;And the sky is the color of the Throne of Glory.Therefore, one may use the blue thread as the subject of a contemplationmeditation. It can then fill the mind with this sky-blue color, so that nothing elseexists in the world besides this blue. One then meditates on the association andsees the blue as the sea. Of course, since the blue dye comes from an aquaticcreature, one is reaching back in this meditation to the source of the blue. Butone also experiences the cool calmness of the sea and the serenity of its depths.The next stage is to associate the blue of the sea with that of the sky. Nowone’s thoughts soar up to the heavens, higher and higher, up to the farthestreaches of the sky. Then one’s thoughts penetrate the sky, and one approachesthe Throne of Glory. Thus, contemplating the color blue is seen as bringing aperson into the spiritual on an entirely diʃerent level. What is very signɹcant,however, is the fact that this type of contemplation meditation is describedexplicitly in the Talmud.It is also signiɹcant that, in Kabbalah sources, this sapphire-blue color is also"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"associated with the “third eye.” One reason is that this color is seen not with thephysical eyes, but with a mental or spiritual eye. In this blue, one can seevisions that are invisible to the physical eyes.There is another type of contemplation that is fairly straightforward andsimple. This consists in contemplating God’s most sacred name, the four-letterTetragrammaton, YHVH (). This contemplation has a number of importantadvantages, the most obvious being that since it is God’s most sacred name, itprovides one with a direct link to the Divine.One must realize that it is forbidden to pronounce this name in any formwhatsoever. This is because it is the holiest of God’s names, and it is linked toevery spiritual level. But for this very reason, this name can be used as a ladderthrough which a person can link himself to the highest spiritual levels.To use this method of contemplation, this name of God can be written on acard or sheet and placed where it can be seen easily. Then it can be used as anobject of contemplation in the usual manner.One may wish to enhance this contemplation with mantra meditation. Hereagain, the mantra Ribbono shel Olam can be very useful. One is then relating toGod directly both through the mantra and through the visual contemplation.For this type of contemplation to be most meaningful, one must have someidea of the meaning of the four letters of God’s name. As I have said, theTetragrammaton is spelled YHVH (). It therefore consists of the fourHebrew letters yod (), heh (), vav(), and heh (). These four letters have avery special significance.This name can be understood on the basis of an ancient Kabbalistic teaching.The teaching states that the four letters contain the mystery of charity.According to this teaching, the ɹrst letter, yod, denotes the coin. The letteryod ()is small and simple like a coin.The second letter, heh (), denotes the hand that gives the coin. Every letterin the Hebrew alphabet also represents a number. Since heh is the ɹfth letter ofthe alphabet, it has a numerical value of ɹve. The “ɹve” of heh alludes to thefive fingers of the hand.The third letter, vav(), denotes the arm reaching out to give. This letter hasthe form of an arm. Furthermore, in Hebrew the word vav denotes a hook, andthus vav has the connotation of connection. Indeed, in Hebrew, the word for theconjunction “and” is represented by the letter vav prefixed to a word.Finally, the fourth letter, the ɹnal heh (), is the hand of the beggar whoaccepts the coin.This is the essence of charity on a mundane level. However, “charity” can also"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"be understood on a divine scale. The greatest possible act of charity is that actthrough which God gives to us. The greatest charity that God gives is existenceitself. We have no claim to existence and cannot demand that God give it to usas our right. Therefore, when He gives us existence, it is an act of charity. Sincethis “charity” is denoted by the Tetragrammaton, the four letters represent themystery of the creative link between God and man.Here again, the yod represents the “coin.” But this time, the coin is not a pieceof copper or silver, but existence itself. As the tenth letter of the Hebrewalphabet, yod has a numerical value of ten. Hence, according to the Kabbalists, italludes to the Ten Sayings of Creation. The concept of the Ten Sayings is foundeven in the Talmud and is not necessarily a mystical teaching. In the account ofcreation in Genesis, the expression “And God said” occurs ten times; these arethe Ten Sayings. These sayings represent the entire act of creation, and thereforerepresent the “coin” of existence that God gives us.The heh of the name is then God’s hand, which holds the existence He wishesto give us. The vav is His arm reaching out to us, to give us existence. Finally,the last heh of the name is our hand, which accepts this existence. Of course,God must give us even this hand. Thus, in a sense, God gives us the “hand”through which we receive existence from Him.As one gazes at the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, one can actually seethis.One begins by contemplating the yod(), which is the smallest letter of theHebrew alphabet, almost like a dot. One contemplates the yod and sees it as theinitial point of creation, the Ten Sayings that brought creation into existence outof nothingness.One then contemplates the ɹrst heh () of the name. This is the level of theDivine at which a vessel comes into existence to hold the abstract power ofcreation. One sees God holding the power of creation, so as to give it to us. Theopening at the top of the heh is the channel from God, while the opening at thebottom is the channel to us below. The heh is thus seen both as a ɹve-ɹngeredhand (based on its numerical value) and as a channel for the forces of creation.One then contemplates the vav(). Here one sees God’s power reaching out tous, wanting to give.The most important letter is the ɹnal heh (). This is our hand, into which wereceive what God is ready to give us. This represents our ability to receive fromGod.The connection between the vav and the heh is extremely important. This isthe connection between the Giver and the receiver. Unless this connection is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"made, we cannot receive anything from God.In the Talmud and the Kabbalah, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are seenas having tremendous spiritual power. Speaking of Bezalel, the architect of theTabernacle that the Israelites built right after the Exodus, the Talmud says,“Bezalel knew how to combine the letters through which heaven and earth werecreated.” Since the world was created with Ten Sayings, and the sayings consistof letters, the letters are seen as the primary ingredients of creation. Thus, whenone contemplates the Tetra-grammaton, the letters serve as the means throughwhich a person connects himself to God and the creative process.There is another way of looking at the four letters of the Tetra-grammaton.The ɹrst two letters, yod () and heh (), are seen as representing the masculineforces of creation. The last two letters, vav() and heh (), represent themasculine and feminine forces of divine providence.This is very closely related to the previous discussion. The ɹrst yod of theTetragrammaton is seen as the “coin,” the Ten Sayings of Creation. This is the“seed” of creation, the masculine element. This “seed” must be placed into thewomb of creation, which is the heh, before it can be brought into fruition. Theheh thus represents both a hand and a womb. Both have the connotation ofholding, although the symbolism is different.The last two letters of the name, vav and heh, represent the masculine andfeminine powers of divine providence. Providence denotes the power throughwhich God directs the world. Here, the vav represents the “seed” of providence,the initial impetus that comes from God. In a sense, it is God’s “arm” of creationreaching out to direct the world He created. The ɹnal heh of the name is thehand with which we accept God’s providence. This can also be seen as the wombthat holds the forces of providence. The small opening on the top of the heh ()is the opening through which the “seed” enters, while the large opening at thebottom is where the “child” emerges.Of course, the forces of creation can never be separated, since if they were,the world would cease to exist. The forces of providence, on the other hand canbe separated, as when God turns His face away from the world. When themasculine and feminine forces of providence are separated, the vav in the nameis separated from the final heh.In this meditation on the Tetragrammaton, one can unite the vav and the ɹnalheh. In Kabbalah texts, this is known as a uniɹcation, yichud in Hebrew. Itserves to open the person to the forces of providence and make him aware ofdivine guidance in his life. Since the heh is the hand through which we receivefrom God, uniting it with the vav makes a person more aware of the Divine"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Presence.As one gazes at the name of God written on the card or parchment, the blackof the writing becomes blacker, while the white of the card becomes whiter.Eventually, one perceives the name as being written with “black ɹre on whiteɹre.” It is signiɹcant to note that according to the Midrash the primeval Torahwas written in this manner, as “black fire on white fire.”After one has been involved in this form of meditation for a period of time,the “ɹre” begins to burn the name of God into one’s mind so that one can easilyvisualize it, even without the card. This involves the method of visualization,another important technique of Jewish meditation, which is the subject of thenext chapter."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"8VISUALIZATIONEarlier, I spoke about the images that one sees when the eyes are closed. Animportant discipline in meditation is learning how to control these images.When one has learned how to control them, one can also learn how to hold animage in the mind’s eye. This technique is known as visualization.A simple way to begin this discipline is to close your eyes and try to picture aletter of the alphabet, for example, the letter A. If you know the Hebrewalphabet, you can try to visualize the letter alef (). Since there are Jewishmeditations that use the letter alef, I shall use it as an example, although anyother letter or figure could also be used.To begin a visualization meditation, just close your eyes and relax, allowingthe images in the mind’s eye to settle down. If you have been practicing mantrameditation, you may want to use it as a relaxing mechanism. In any case, after afew minutes, the images in the visual field will become easier to control.When the visual ɹeld is fairly calm, you can begin to try to visualize the alef.You may have an alef printed on a card and set the image of it in your mind.Then close your eyes and try to picture the alef. Try to see it with your eyesclosed exactly as you saw it with your eyes open.At ɹrst, this may be extremely diɽcult. The images that you see in yourmind’s eye are very diɽcult to control. If you have never done this before, itwill be almost impossible the first time.One important aid in visualization is the name of the object to be visualized.If you are trying to visualize the alef, you may repeat the word alef to yourselfperiodically. You may even wish to repeat the word over and over, as if it werea mantra. This not only relaxes the visual field, but locks the mind on to the alef.Repeating the word alef as a mantra will bring the letter into the mind’s eye.Another good aid is to initiate the visualization exercise with a contemplationmeditation. If you wish to visualize the alef, ɹrst spend several dayscontemplating the letter written on a card approximately twenty minutes a day.This will serve to ɹx the image in the mind. It will then be much easier to ɹx"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"the alef in the visual field with the eyes closed.If you still encounter diɽculty, the meditation session can be split betweencontemplation and visualization. Spend the ɹrst ɹfteen minutes of a half-hoursession contemplating the alef, looking at it with your eyes open. Then, duringthe next fifteen minutes, you can try to visualize it with the eyes closed.The ability to do this exercise varies from individual to individual. Some areable to do it the ɹrst time, while others have to work for weeks before they canvisualize a letter. With patience and perseverance, however, it can be done byalmost anyone.Even after depicting the letter in the mind’s eye, the average person will beable to hold the image only for several seconds. Then, like all such images, itwill dissolve into other images. With time and practice, one eventually developsthe ability to hold the image clearly and ɹrmly in the mind’s eye for extendedperiods. When this is accomplished, one has come a long way in gaining controlover the mental processes.The ability to hold an image in the mind’s eye is discussed at length in theKabbalah texts dealing with meditation. Thus, the Sefer Yetzirah refers to twoprocesses in depicting the letters, “engraving” (chakikah) and “hewing”(chatzivah). Both processes are seen as important if one is going to depict theletters. As discussed in the previous chapter, the Hebrew letters are seen aschannels of the forces of creation, and as such they can be used as a powerfulmeans of drawing down spiritual energy. However, “engraving” and “hewing”are useful also for less esoteric forms of meditation.The term “engraving” denotes ɹxing an image in the mind’s eye so that it doesnot waver or move. No matter what other images may arise in the ɹeld ofvision, the engraved image remains there, as if the image were actuallyengraved in the mind. Once a person has accomplished this, he can usuallydepict the desired image as soon as he begins his meditation, almost as a reflex.However, even when the image is clear and steady—“engraved” in the mind,as it were—it is usually surrounded by other images. The next step is to isolatethe image. Thus, for example, if one were visualizing the letter alef, one wouldattempt to isolate it and rid the mind’s eye of all other imagery. This is knownas “hewing,” or chatzivah. The analogy is to hewing out a stone from thesurrounding rock. The process consists in designating the desired stone and thenhewing away the extraneous stone. One does the same thing in the mind,hewing away all extraneous imagery surrounding the desired form. All that isleft is the image one desires.There are a number of ways of “hewing” away surrounding imagery. One way"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"is to replace all the mental images other than the alef with pure white. Firstfocus on the alef, allowing it to ɹll the mind. Then gradually hew away theimages around the alef, replacing them with white ɹre. Imagine the white ɹreburning away the other images. Begin with a small spot of white ɹre at the topof the alef, using it to burn away a small spot of imagery. Let the white ɹreexpand, burning away larger and larger areas. As it moves around the alef,burning away images on all sides. Finally, one sees the alef alone, written inblack fire on white fire.In general, a visualization technique such as this is very valuable and can beused in other forms of Jewish meditation. Thus, many classical Kabbalah textsspeak about yichudim or “uniɹcations,” which I discussed brieɻy in the previouschapter. For the most part, the meditational method of yichudim involvesimaging various names of God and then manipulating the letters. In general, themethod of yichudim is highly advanced and requires some knowledge ofKabbalah.*A good introduction to the method of yichudim involves visualizing theTetragrammaton, YHVH(). This is similar to the technique of contemplatingthe Tetragrammaton, described in the previous chapter, but here it is donewithout any external aid. Signiɹcantly, an exercise that entails visualizing theTetragrammaton is mentioned in the Shulchan Arukh, the standard code ofJewish law. It is also an introduction to a number of other, more advancedtechniques discussed in the Kabbalah.By visualizing God’s name, one can attain a tremendous feeling of closeness toGod. One actually feels the presence of God and experiences a deep sense ofawe in the presence. A number of classical Judaic sources ɹnd an allusion tosuch visualization in the verse “I have placed YHVH before me at all times” (Ps.16:8). This type of visualization is also useful during worship and prayer.Here, too, you can use contemplation as an introduction to visualization. Ifyou ɹnd it diɽcult to visualize the Tetragrammaton, spend a number of dayscontemplating the name written on a sheet or card. You can spend the ɹrst halfof a session contemplating the written name and the other half visualizing itwith the eyes closed. Eventually, you will be able to visualize it without usingthe card at all.Once you become adept at visualizing the name, you can use it for the simpleyichud discussed in the last chapter. As discussed there, the vav() and ɹnal heh () of the name are the masculine and feminine forces of providence. When thevav and heh are separated, there is no connection between God and the worldbelow other than His creative energy. Therefore, like a man and woman in love,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the vav and heh yearn and long to be united, to bring God’s power to the lowerworld. When the vav and heh are united, God’s presence becomes palpable andone can have a very strong experience of the Divine.One accomplishes this yichud by visualizing the divine name, YHVH ().One focuses on the vav and heh, making oneself aware of the longing andyearning of these two letters to unite. When the longing between the two lettersbecomes unbearable, they ɹnally unite, and a spiritual ɻood is released. Onefeels this as a torrent of divine energy ɻowing through the body and mind. Oneis bathed in the spiritual experience and overwhelmed by it, totally opened up,like a vessel for the divine.Once proɹciency in visualization is achieved, there are more advancedmethods that one can learn. One such method, mentioned in the Kabbalisticsources, is to imagine the sky opening up and to depict oneself ascending intothe spiritual realm. One rises through the seven ɹrmaments, one by one, untilone reaches the highest heaven. On this level, one depicts in one’s mind a hugewhite curtain, inɹnite in size, ɹlling the entire mind. Written on this whitecurtain, one visualizes the Tetragrammaton.The black of the letters and the white of the curtain become intensiɹed, untilthe letters appear to be black ɹre on white ɹre. Gradually, the letters of theTetragrammaton expand, until they appear to be huge mountains of black ɹre.When the four letters ɹll the mind completely, one is, as it were, swallowed upin God’s name.On a still more advanced level, the letters appear to be not merely written onthe curtain, but solid objects, with both dimension and texture. One can seeoneself actually entering into the letters, surrounded by their essence on allsides.Finally, one can reach the level where one sees the letters as living entities, asif each letter were an angelic being. One becomes uniquely aware of the lifeforce and spiritual energy in each letter, of the signiɹcance of the letters and ofthe ɻow of energy between one letter and the next. One becomes aware of theuniɹcation of the Giver with the receiver and of the ultimate male and femaleelements of creation.These last methods can bring a person to very high spiritual levels and shouldnot be taken lightly. The original sources state that before attempting any ofthese more advanced methods, one should spend the entire day in preparation,reciting the Psalms and studying Torah. Before beginning the meditation, oneshould immerse oneself in a mikveh (ritual bath) or any other natural body ofwater to cleanse oneself both physically and spiritually. Some sources also"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"indicate that one should dress totally in white for these advanced meditations.This type of visualization can be dangerous and should not be attemptedwithout an experienced spiritual master or a meditation partner. The Baal ShemTov recommends that one have a partner for any type of advanced meditation.Then, if necessary, one partner can bring the other back to the real world.Visualization is valuable for another reason. In deeper forms of meditation,one often sees visions. As I discussed earlier, these visions should not be takentoo seriously. Unless a person is very advanced and working under the tutelageof an experienced master, these visions are almost certain to be spurious. It istherefore recommended that when any visions appear, they be banished fromthe mind. If one learns to control one’s visualization, then this is fairly easy.Some sources recommend that visions, when they occur, should be banishedfrom the mind and replaced with the Tetragrammaton.When one learns how to control the imagery in the mind’s eye, there is muchless danger that spurious visions will appear. One’s meditation is then pure andundisturbed by low-level side effects.*In my book Meditation and Kabbalah, a number of important yichudim are presented in their entirety."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"9NOTHINGNESSMeditation on nothingness is a topic upon which I have touched brieɻy in anearlier chapter. Actually, this is a very advanced type of meditation and not forbeginners. It is not recommended for practice without the guidance of a spiritualmaster and should never be practiced alone. I shall discuss it here because thistechnique is closely related to visualization methods and is important forunderstanding a number of other areas in Jewish meditation and mysticism.Once proɹciency has been achieved in visualization techniques, it is possibleto attempt to visualize pure nothingness. Nothingness has no counterpart in thereal world, so one must be able to create a perception of it in the mind. It is auseful technique to attain closeness to God and to achieve a realization of theself.As in the case of other advanced techniques, this can be extremely dangerous.The reason why it should never be practiced alone is that one can get“swallowed up” in the nothingness of the meditation and not be able to return.Therefore, one should always have a partner or a spiritual master available tobring one back to objective reality.Before we can begin to discuss this type of meditation, we must have an ideaof what nothingness looks like. When one ɹrst thinks of nothingness, one mayimage it as being like the blackness of empty space. The interplanetary void mayseem as close to nothingness as a person can imagine. If one is expert invisualization, it is fairly easy to visualize empty space and pure emptyblackness. This indeed may be a ɹrst step toward visualizing nothingness, but itis not nothingness. Space is space, and blackness is blackness—neither isnothingness.A next step in attempting to visualize nothingness would be to attempt tovisualize pure, transparent, empty space, without any background color. Onecan imagine oneself looking into a pure, colorless, transparent crystal, with thetransparency extending to inɹnity. According to some commentaries, this is theconnotation of the “brickwork of sapphire” that the Israelites saw under God’s"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"feet (Exod. 24:10). These commentaries translate the Hebrew expression livenathha-sappir as “transparency of crystal” rather than “brickwork of sapphire.” Theysay that it is related to the meditation in which one images pure transparencewithout any color. One images ɹrst the transparency of crystal and then thetransparency of pure colorless empty space.One way to do this is to image the air in front of you. It is, of course,perfectly transparent, and therefore you cannot see it. Instead you see what is atthe other end of the room. Using the “hewing” technique described in theprevious chapter, you should be able to rid yourself of the image of the otherend of the room; then you will have a pure image of the transparent air aroundyou. It will be pure transparence, with no form or color.Years ago, I found this to be a very helpful technique for experiencing thepresence of God. It is an important teaching of Judaism that God is omnipresent,totally ɹlling all creation. The clearest statement of this is the verse “The wholeworld is ɹlled with His glory” (Isa. 6:3). God ɹlls all creation and is evenpresent in the air around us. I would therefore contemplate the air around meand imagine it ɹlled with God’s presence. This would bring a very great feelingof God’s closeness.Now, although this technique involves imaging the transparent empty space,what is imaged is still space; it is not nothingness.So what does nothingness look like?It is taught that nothing is what you see behind your head. Of course, sightdoes not extend behind the head. Therefore, what you see behind the head isnothing. In other words, you see nothingness.This teaching can be used as a contemplation. Attempt to contemplate whatyou see behind your head. You realize that it is nothing, but with practice, youwill be able to make it into an object of contemplation. This is a powerfultechnique to gain a conception of pure nothingness.In the Bible, it appears that this or a similar technique was used as a precursorof prophecy. There are a number of references to voices and prophecy seemingto come from behind. Thus, Ezekiel said, “I heard behind me a loud voiceproclaiming, ‘Blessed be God’s glory from His place’ ” (Ezek. 3:12). Likewise,regarding a certain degree of revelation, the prophet said, “Your ears shall heara voice behind you” (Isa. 30:21). This might indicate that by meditating on thenothingness seen behind the head, one opens oneself up to the experience ofprophecy.Other sources, however, indicate that instead of contemplating what one seesbehind the head, one should contemplate what one sees inside the head. This is"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"a method discussed by Rabbi Abraham Abulaɹa, one of the most importantwriters on Kabbalistic meditation. Of course, what one sees inside the head isalso nothingness, so the experience is essentially the same.To learn how to visualize nothingness properly can take years. It is not aneasy discipline. However, once one has a good depiction of nothingness, one canuse it as a powerful visualization technique. Of all the images one can visualize,the purest is a vision of nothingness.Visualizing nothingness is also a technique used in the most advancedmeditational exercises. If one visualizes nothingness and at the same time clearsthe mind of thought, the mind becomes a total blank. The mind is then at itsmost sensitive, open to even the most ethereal experiences. This is therefore animportant technique for experiencing the spiritual.This can sometimes be a traumatic experience. When one locks the mind on toa visualization of nothingness and clears the consciousness of all other thought,the mind becomes so sensitive that even the slightest sensation can beoverwhelming. It is like turning up a radio to full volume, so that the softestvoice becomes a roar. On the other hand, it is only at full volume that theweakest signals can be heard.At this level, even the random thoughts that tug at the corner of the mind arefelt as mental earthquakes. Before one can proceed, one must dampen allthought completely. Finally, when all thought is quieted, one can have anexperience of the spiritual. This involves a deep feeling of awe, shame, andhumility.Some Kabbalists teach that this is the mystery of Ezekiel’s vision. At the verybeginning of his vision, the prophet says, “I looked, and saw a storm windcoming from the north, a great cloud, and ɻashing ɹre ...” (Ezek, 1:4). TheZohar teaches that the wind, the cloud, and the ɹre are the three barriersthrough which a prophet must pass before he enters the realm of the Divine.The ɹrst thing that Ezekiel experienced was “a storm wind.” There is a doublemeaning here, however, since the Hebrew word for wind is ruach, which alsomeans “spirit.” Therefore, what Ezekiel saw can also be translated as “a stormyspirit.” The stormy spirit relates to the ɹrst experience mentioned earlier. Whenthere is literally nothing in the mind, all the natural agitations of the mind aregreatly intensiɹed. This is the barrier of the “storm wind” through which theprophet must pass.The second barrier the prophet encounters is “a great cloud.” This is themuʀing and restriction of all thought, an opaqueness of the mind, in whichnothing can be seen or experienced. It is a barrier that can easily discourage the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"prophet if he does not have the will to proceed further. As he is trying toascend, he faces a cloud barrier beyond which he cannot see and which he muststrive to overcome.The ɹnal barrier is the “ɻashing ɹre.” This is the sense of awe, shame, anddread that the prophet experiences when he ɹrst breaks into the spiritual realm.Throughout the Bible, ɹre is a metaphor for shame and dread. Fire burns andhence is an over-abundance of sensation—a sensation so intense that it cannotbe tolerated. Thus, while the cloud is the obliteration of sensation, the ɹre is theopposite, the overabundance of sensation. The cloud also shows the prophet thatone who is unworthy will not see anything, while the ɹre demonstrates thatsuch a person may be in danger as well.This is the manner in which meditation on nothingness opens the door toprophecy. It can also be used to get in touch with the innermost self. This, ofcourse, raises the question, What is the nature of the self?Normally, when a person thinks of himself, the ɹrst thing he thinks of is hisbody. It is almost a reɻex action. Ask a person to point to himself, and he willalmost inevitably point to his chest. Perhaps, if he is more perceptive, he willpoint to his head, the seat of his brain, seeing the mind as being morerepresentative of the self than the body.The Kabbalists point out that the body is not the self. Since I can speak of “mybody,” the body cannot be “me.” The body is “mine”—something associatedwith the me; but the ultimate me is something much more profound than thebody. Using the same argument, I can also speak of “my mind.” Indeed, I speakof “my mind” just as I speak of “my body.” This would imply that just as thebody is not the real me, the mind is also not the real me. Carrying the argumenta step further, I can even speak of “my soul.” This would imply that even thesoul is not the real me.This being the case, the question of selfhood becomes very diɽcult indeed.What is the real me? A hint to the answer can be found in the Hebrew word for“I,” ani (). It is signiɹcant to note that if the letters of ani are rearranged,they spell the word ayn or ayin (), which denotes nothingness. This wouldseem to imply that the real “me” is the nothingness within me.This can be understood in a fairly straightforward manner. The real me is mysense of volition. It is the intangible will that impels me to do whatever I decideto do. Even if I think, I must ɹrst will myself to think. In that sense, will is evenhigher than thought. It is obvious that it is the “I” that tells my mind to think.However, the fact that I must will myself to think implies that the source ofmy will is on a level that is beyond thought. It is therefore impossible for me to"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"imagine the source of my will, and there is no category in my conscious mindinto which it will ɹt. Therefore, when I try to imagine the source of my will, thereal “me,” all I can depict is nothingness.This can also be understood in another manner. Earlier I mentioned that thereare three things that appear to be identiɹable with the self: body, mind, andsoul. As I noted, neither the body, the mind, nor the soul is the self. However, inanother sense, the self is a combination of body, mind, and soul. The threetogether appear to define the self.However, this has an important ramiɹcation. If body is not the self, and mindis not the self, and soul is not the self, but the combination of the three is, thenthe deɹnition of the self is still an enigma. It would seem that it is possible toremove the body, remove the mind, and remove the soul, and still have somespark of the self. But when body, mind, and soul are removed, all that remainsis nothingness. Again it appears that the self is nothingness.It is not nothingness because of lack of existence. Rather, it is nothingnessbecause of the lack of a category in the mind in which to place it. It is verymuch like the situation of what one sees behind ones head. One seesnothingness, not because there isn’t anything there, but because one does nothave eyes behind the head to see with. Where there is no sense organ, or nocategory in the mind, to grasp certain information, then that information isperceived as nothingness. If there is no other information competing with it,then it is an experience of pure nothingness.This can also be understood in a deeper manner. If the most basic ingredientof self is will, then this must also be connected to the divine will. In this sense, aperson’s will comes from the spark of the Divine in the person. Therefore, whena person visualizes nothingness, he is, to some degree, in touch with the Divinewithin himself.This can be understood on the basis of Kabbalistic teachings that the highestspiritual levels can be understood only in terms of nothingness. This may seemdiɽcult to understand. To comprehend it, one must understand how Judaism ingeneral, and the Kabbalists in particular, view God.People often say that “God is spirit” or that “God is power” or that “God islove.” But the fact is that none of these sentences is true. Actually, the sentence“God is ...” is a statement that cannot be completed. To complete the sentencewould be to place God in the same category as something else. If oneunderstands the true nature of God, then this is impossible.This truth is derived from the very basic Jewish teaching that God is thecreator of all things. This has very important implications. For one, it means that"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"even concepts as basic as will or mind are creations of God. Indeed, the Zoharexplicitly states that God does not have will or mind in any anthropomorphicsense. Rather, in order to use will and mind to create the world, God ɹrst had tocreate these concepts. To say otherwise would be to imply that will and mindare coequal with God, which, again, is impossible.Even logic itself must be seen as something created by God. Were this not so,and if we were to insist that God be bound by logic, then we would have to saythat logic is higher than God, or more fundamental. Again, if we look at God asthe creator of all things, then God must also be the creator of logic. This hasimportant ramiɹcations: if one discovers paradoxes in relation to God, it is not aproblem. Paradoxes are merely ideas that transcend logic, and since God is thecreator of logic, He can use it as He desires, but He is not bound by it. Ofcourse, it is taught that God bound Himself by logic when He created the world,but this was a voluntary act, and not something intrinsic.The fact that God created every category means that anything for which aword exists in the human language must of necessity denote something createdby God. Even the word “God” itself denotes our conception of Him, and not Histrue essence. Since everything conceivable—including any category of thoughtthat the mind can imagine—was created by God, there is nothing conceivablethat can be associated with Him.Let us say that I want to think about God. There is, however, no category inmy mind in which I can place Him. Therefore, trying to depict God is like tryingto see without eyes. When I try to see where there are no eyes, all I see isnothing. Similarly, when I try to think about God, all that my mind can depict isnothing.The Zoharic literature expresses this by declaring to God, “No thought cangrasp You at all.” Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Lyady (1745–1813), one of thegreatest Jewish mystics, notes that the Zohar uses the expression for “grasp”that is usually associated with a physical object. He explains, “Just as a handcannot grasp thought, so the mind cannot grasp God.” Our physical sensescannot grasp or detect thought and therefore experience it as nothing. The sameis true of the way the mind experiences God.Hence, the closest one can come to thinking about God is to depictnothingness and to realize that behind it is God. It is for this reason thatnothingness meditation was seen as a means of drawing close to God.This is not to say that we cannot speak about God at all. As the major Jewishphilosophers point out, statements we make about God are either “attributes ofaction,” stating what God does, or “negative attributes,” saying what God is not."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"We may say that God is good, kind, loving, and omnipotent. However, these areall descriptions of what God does and how He acts, but not what He is.It is important to realize that although we cannot speak about God, it is veryeasy to speak to God. Indeed, this is the subject of the following chapters.When a person imagines nothingness, he should realize that this is the closestthat it is possible to come to imagining God. Most certainly, this does not meanthat God is nothingness. In every possible way, God is more real than anythingelse that exists. However, it means that since there is nothing in the humanmind that can relate to God as He actually is, nothingness is the closest thing toa perception of God that we can obtain. When a person depicts nothingness, hemust realize that behind the nothingness is God.There is a method to image this. The technique consists in imaging the fourletters of the Tetragrammaton as in chapter 8. However, when one “hews” awaythe surrounding imagery, instead of replacing it with “white ɹre,” one replacesit with nothingness. One begins by imaging a small area of nothingness at theedge of the yod. This area of nothingness is expanded until it totally surroundsthe four letters. The ɹrst few times that one attempts this, the letters may seemto be surrounded by transparent space. With practice, one can actually make theletters seem to be surrounded by nothingness.If the letters are suspended in nothingness, there will appear to be nothingaround them. In essence, the letters will ɹll the entire ɹeld of vision. Still, theletters are not warped or distorted in any way; rather, the space between themand around them is ɹlled with nothingness. Of course, it is impossible toimagine this unless one has actually experienced it. Like panoscopic vision orsynesthesia, it is something that cannot be described.Another, even more advanced technique is to see the letters of theTetragrammaton behind the nothingness. Then the letters are, as it were, hiddenby nothingness, just as God Himself is. In a sense, this is similar to panoscopicvision. One “sees” nothingness, but one is simultaneously looking behind it,where one “sees” the letters of the Divine Name.All of these techniques are described or alluded to in the Kabbalah literature.However, let me repeat that the techniques described in this chapter are allhighly advanced and should not be attempted without expert guidance andconsiderable experience in meditational techniques."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"10CONVERSING WITH GODIn the previous chapter, I discussed meditative techniques that are both highlyadvanced and potentially dangerous for a beginner. The technique that I shalldiscuss in this chapter, on the other hand, is very simple and is consideredamong the safest. Still, many people feel that it is one of the most powerful ofall the Jewish meditative techniques.Earlier, I spoke about how diɽcult it is to speak—or even to think—aboutGod. God is totally ineʃable, beyond the realms of thought and speech. Yet, asdiɽcult as it is to speak about God, it is relatively easy to speak to Him. Whatperson has not at some point in life prayed to God in his own words? If one is abeliever, it is a natural reflex in times of trouble or distress to direct one’s wordstoward God. When a loved one is ill or when one faces something unfaceable,one’s thoughts and prayers automatically ɻow toward the Supreme Being.Prayer is a cry from the depths of the heart, from the ground of one’s being, andcommunication is simple and direct.Children naturally tend to pray to God. A child who is lonely or hurt willautomatically call out to his Father in heaven. A child who has never beentaught to pray may begin to do so on his own. It is as if there were a built-ininstinct that leads us to call beyond the realm of the physical when we are indire need.It seems that, in general, Jews pray spontaneously less than non-Jews, at leastnowadays. There seems to be a feeling that Jewish prayer must be in Hebrew, ina prescribed manner, with a predetermined wording. Many Jews are surprisedto learn that there is an unbroken tradition of spontaneous prayer in the Jewishreligion. If we look at the spectrum of Jewish literature, we ɹnd numerousreferences to spontaneous personal prayer. Many great Jewish leadersconsidered their own prayers to be very important to their spiritualdevelopment. And in Europe, it was the most natural thing in the world for Jewsto cry out to God in their native Yiddish.Although many sources discuss spontaneous prayer, one Jewish leader gave it"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"a central role in his teachings: Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Rabbi Nachman wasa great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of the Chasidic movement. TheBaal Shem taught that every individual could attain a strong personalrelationship with God. Rabbi Nachman expanded this concept, teaching that themost powerful method to attain such a relationship with God is personal prayerin one’s own native language.This, of course, was not meant to downgrade the importance of the formalsystem of worship, which forms the Jew’s daily order of devotion. Theprescribed worship service is of paramount importance in Judaism. However,worship services can at times become dry and sterile. One’s own personalprayers, on the other hand, are always connected to the wellsprings of the heart.How does a person begin to speak to God? In times of crisis or trouble, it isalmost automatic. There is a need to call out to someone, and one knows thatGod is always there. When our lives are on an even keel, on the other hand, it isnot as easy. When everything is going our way, what is there to discuss withGod? How does one begin a conversation? Sometimes, it is almost embarrassing.It is very much like being away from a parent or a close friend for a longtime. In times of crisis, it is easy to renew contact since the crisis itself serves asa point of departure. Similarly, when there are special occasions, it is easy topick up the phone and say hello. This is why relatives often see one anotheronly at weddings and funerals. Such occasions serve as an excuse to get togetherafter prolonged absence.To pick up the phone and, without any excuse, call a friend you have notspoken to in years is not a very easy thing to do. How does one justify thesudden, unexpected call? And perhaps most important of all, how does onejustify not having made contact for the long period before the call?For very much the same reason, it is diɽcult for some people to begin aconversation with God. How does one start such a conversation? And what doesone say?If you need an excuse, you can use this book. Tell God, “I just read this bookabout having conversations with God. I felt it was time I did it.”Another problem that people encounter when attempting to speak to God isthat they feel inadequate. They are aware that God knows their shortcomingsand sins, and they feel ashamed in His presence. Others may feel that their livesas Jews are not what they should be and that they cannot approach God as aJew.Even if one felt comfortable morally and religiously (and who really does?),there is a basic awe and feeling of inadequacy that everyone feels when trying"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"to speak to God. It is told that the great Chasidic leader Rabbi Zusia of Hanipoli(c. 1720–1800) once came late to synagogue. When he was asked whathappened, he replied that when he woke up in the morning, he began the usualprayer, “I give thanks before You ...” (Modeh ani lefanekha). He said the ɹrstthree words and could go no further. He explained, “I became suddenly aware ofwho the ‘I’ was, and who the ‘You’ was. I was struck speechless and could notcontinue.”All this adds up to the fact that many people consider it extremely diɽcult toinitiate a conversation with God. Rabbi Nachman speaks about this atconsiderable length.It is signiɹcant that Rabbi Nachman refers to this practice of speaking to God,not as prayer, but as meditation. It appears that the line between prayer andmeditation here is a very ɹne one, but there is an important diʃerence. When aperson speaks to God spontaneously, whenever he feels impelled to do so, thenit is prayer. When a person makes it a ɹxed practice and spends a deɹnite timeeach day conversing with God, then it is meditation. As we have discussedearlier, meditation is thinking in a controlled manner. If this thinking consists ina conversation with God, it is no less a meditative experience.In this context, Rabbi Nachman prescribes making a commitment to spendinga ɹxed amount of time each day speaking to God. The amount of time heprescribes is approximately an hour every evening. In our fast-moving modernsociety, many ɹnd twenty to thirty minutes a more comfortable period for suchconversation. The main thing is that it be for a ɹxed period of time and that itbe practiced every day without fail.The most diɽcult thing is to begin. Rabbi Nachman advises sitting down inthe place where you meditate and saying to yourself, “For the next twentymintes, I will be alone with God.” This in itself is signiɹcant, since it is like thebeginning of a “visit.” Even if there is nothing to say, it is a valid experiencesince you are spending time alone with God, aware of His presence. If you sitlong enough, says Rabbi Nachman, you will eventually find something to say.If you have diɽculty in beginning the conversation, Rabbi Nachman advisesrepeating the phrase “Master of the Universe” over and over. This can comprisethe entire conversation. When you say these words, be aware that you arecalling out to God. Eventually, your thoughts will open up, and you will ɹndother ways of expressing yourself.Of course, “Master of the Universe” is nothing other than Ribbono shel Olam, aphrase that I discussed earlier as a Jewish mantra. Here we see that it can alsobe used to call out to God in a most basic way, to establish communication."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"If you still cannot begin speaking with God, Rabbi Nachman suggests makingthis diɽculty itself the point of conversation. Tell God how much you wouldlike to speak to Him. Explain to Him that it is hard for you to ɹnd something tosay. Ask God to help you ɹnd words with which to address Him. Discuss theproblem with Him as you would with a good friend. Once the conversation hasbegun, it is usually easy to continue.Another point of departure can be the feeling of alienation and distance fromGod. You can initiate a conversation by asking God to bring you closer to Him.Tell him how far you feel from Him and how much closer you would like to be.Ask Him to help you find such closeness.The conversation does not have to vary. One can speak to God about the samething day after day, week after week. Obviously, it is impossible to bore God.Since this is a meditation, the regular habit of holding a conversation is asimportant as its content. If you are asking God to help you speak to Him, or todraw you closer, this exercise will help you develop your ability to hold moreextensive conversations with God.You can repeat the same sentence or phrase as often as you wish. Anysigniɹcant sentence can be the point of the entire meditation. You can changethe phrase or sentence that you are using at any time. Eventually, you willdevelop enough flexibility to express your thoughts to God freely.In any case, just as with everything else, practice helps, and one can becomeproɹcient in holding conversations with the Inɹnite Being. Once you learn howto converse with God with ease, you can speak in a quiet, hushed voice, makingyourself more and more aware of the One to whom you are speaking. As youconverse, you will become increasingly aware of God’s presence. At this point,the conversation with God becomes an awesome experience.As the conversation becomes easier and more relaxed, the experience deepens.It becomes a powerful meditative technique, which can easily bring one tohigher states of consciousness. In these states of consciousness, God’s presencebecomes almost palpable.The question arises as to what advantage this method has over such othermethods as mantra meditation or contemplation. Since this is an inner-directedmeditation, it has some important advantages.One of the purposes of meditation is to help banish the ego. This is oftendiɽcult in the modern world. Furthermore, in the high-pressure world of oureveryday lives, a person must have a strong sense of self and purpose in ordernot to be trampled. For many people, a meditative regimen that weakens theego and sense of self may be counterproductive. One may ɹnd one’s goals in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"meditation diametrically opposed to one’s ambitions and aspirations in theworld.The method of conversing with God does not have this drawback. It is truethat, like other forms of meditation, this method can help a person overcomethe ego. Nevertheless, this is a method that replaces the ego with somethingstronger. In speaking to God, a person can gain a view of himself from adiʃerent perspective and begin to see himself as a branch of the Divine. Thistype of meditation makes one, as it were, partners with the Divine. Thus, forexample, if one has discussed future plans with God and still feels good aboutthem, one’s resolution and feeling of purpose are all the stronger.Of course, this can have dangers in the opposite direction. If a person does notnullify his ego suɽciently, he can become so bullheaded and obstinate thatpeople cannot deal with him. Nothing is so distasteful as a person who acts as ifhe has a direct line to God. Therefore, the goal is to attain and maintain abalance.Besides strengthening one’s resolve, conversing with God can also help one toɹnd direction in life. I have discussed this earlier, when I spoke about ameditation concerned with rearranging one’s life. Here again, by conversingwith God, a person can see himself from a God’s-eye view, as it were. He canthen determine if the type of life he is leading is one that is worthy from God’spoint of view. If it is not, meditation will help him find ways of improving it.It is signiɹcant that the Hebrew verb for praying is hitpalel. Hebrew linguistsnote that this is the reɻexive of the word palel, meaning “to judge.” Therefore,hitpalel means to judge oneself.This is not diɽcult to understand in the context of our discussion. When aperson speaks to God, he is able to see himself from a God’s-eye view and he isjudging himself in the deepest sense possible. He is looking at his most profoundaspirations in the mirror of his prayer and judging whether or not they areworthy. Little by little, the person can also purge himself of any encumbrancesto prayer.Actually, this is like a type of therapy. In many ways, speaking to God is likespeaking to a therapist. What, then, is the diʃerence between this method ofprayer-meditation and psychotherapy?First, it is true that both psychotherapy and meditation can help a persondirect his life more eʃectively. In psychotherapy, however, the answer comesfrom without, while in prayer-meditation, the answer comes from within. If theperson is basically healthy, his answers will reɻect his own values andaspirations much more truly than if they are ɹltered through the eyes of a"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"therapist who may have an entirely diʃerent value system. Prayer-meditationmay also spur a person to learn more about life and its meaning from externalsources, so that help can also come from without.Furthermore, psychotherapy deals only with the mundane dimensions of man,and not with his spiritual dimensions. Prayer-meditation, on the other hand,deals primarily with the spiritual dimension. Psychotherapy is primarily a wayof working out problems, while meditation is a method of enhancing thespiritual dimensions of life.There are many ways in which prayer-meditation can be very much like self-therapy, and therefore, it has all the dangers inherent therein. As in therapy, aperson can uncover deep, unresolved problems that can cause great pain andsuʃering if they are not worked out. In psychotherapy, one has the therapist tohelp if the situation becomes too diɽcult. If one is using meditation as self-therapy, on the other hand, one can get oneself into a psychological cul-de-sacand not be able to escape.Therefore, if you ɹnd yourself using prayer-meditation as a form of self-therapy, it is very important that you have a guide who understands exactlywhat is happening. Without such a guide, the results can be more negative thanpositive. The guide should be someone who is well adjusted and psychologicallystrong, with extensive successful experience in guiding neophyte meditators. Theguide’s advice should help the meditator find a proper balance in his or her life."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"11THE WAY OF PRAYEROne of my students, a psychiatrist-healer, once told me that when he began hisinvolvement in spiritual practices, he used to rush through the morning serviceso that he would have time to meditate. This went on for a few months. Then,in one of our classes, we discussed how the worship service itself was originallydesigned to be meditative exercise and how it could be used as such. After this,he told me, instead of rushing through the morning service, he used the serviceitself as his daily meditation.Many Jews are still uncomfortable with meditation. They feel that it issomething from another culture, tacked onto Judaism. Although manytraditional sources discuss Jewish meditation, after a century of neglect, manyJews ɹnd the notion diɽcult to accept. Even the word “meditation” has an alienring to it, as if it were something borrowed from another world.On the other hand, the most accepted manner for a Jew to relate to God isthrough the daily services. An observant Jew worships (or davens) three times aday. In most communities, the synagogues hold daily services. Of course, inOrthodox circles, daily prayer is considered an important part of the dailyregimen.The three daily services are the morning service, known as shacharith; theafternoon service, known as minchah; and the evening service, known as maarivor arevith. The service on the Sabbath and festivals is essentially the same,except that a fourth additional, or musaf, service is added in the morning afterthe Torah is read.The focus of each of these services is the Amidah, which literally means “thatwhich involves standing.” The Amidah is a silent prayer that must be said whileone is standing. On weekdays, it originally consisted of eighteen prayers andpetitions, and is therefore also referred to as the Shemoneh Esreh, whichliterally means “The Eighteen.” In the ɹrst century, a nineteenth prayer wasadded, making this appellation not strictly accurate.The Amidah can be found in any standard Jewish prayer book. Of the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"eighteen sections, the ɹrst three and last three are always essentially the same,both on weekdays and on the Sabbath and Holy Days. On the Sabbath and HolyDays, however, the middle twelve (or thirteen) prayers are replaced with asingle section relating to the Sabbath or festival.The most important part of the Amidah, especially from a meditative point ofview, is the opening paragraph. This paragraph consists of a short prayer thatestablishes the worshiper’s basic relationship to God. This paragraph alwaysforms the beginning of the Amidah, whether on weekdays or on Sabbaths orfestivals.In order to use this section of the Amidah as a meditation, one must memorizeit. It is best to do so in the original Hebrew, since the language itself hastremendous spiritual power. If one does not know Hebrew, it is permissible torecite the prayer in English or any other language. The words have power in anylanguage, but not as much as they have in the original. In order to use theAmidah as a meditation, on the other hand, one should be able to recite it in theoriginal and know its meaning.The Amidah was authored just before the close of the prophetic period twoand a half thousand years ago, during the early years of the Second Temple inJerusalem. Ezra had returned from Babylonia to the Holy Land and was rallyingthe people to reestablish Judaism as a viable way of life. Jerusalem and theHoly Land had been reduced to ashes by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar,and it was out of these ashes that Ezra and his followers built Judaism anew.Toward this end, Ezra gathered together one hundred and twenty of thegreatest sages of his time. This group, which also included the last of the biblicalprophets, was known as the Great Assembly (keneseth ha-gedolah). The GreatAssembly enacted a number of important rules in order to preserve Torahobservance among Jews scattered all over the world. One of the majoraccomplishments of the Great Assembly was to canonize the text of the Bible.It was the Great Assembly that ɹrst authored the Amidah. The prayer istherefore one of the most ancient in existence today. Among its authors wereHaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who also composed books of the Bible. Thesame spiritual energy that went into writing the Bible also went into writing theAmidah. It was designated as a universal prayer and meditation for all Jewsfrom that time on.The power of the Amidah comes from the words themselves. The prayer wascarefully composed by highly advanced spiritual individuals so as to enable amaximum relationship with God. As we shall see, in the ɹrst paragraph, aperson is drawn closer and closer to God, until he feels the presence of God all"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"around him, penetrating his very being.Since the Amidah was composed as a meditation prayer, it is necessary torepeat it as often as possible. It is for this reason that it was required that thesame prayer be said three times every day.As discussed earlier, one of the reasons a mantra works is that when thewords are said over and over, the mind develops a special resonance with them.The words can then be said automatically, without special eʃort orconcentration. Since the mind is not concerned with saying the words, it canallow itself to be filled with their meaning.The same is true of a prayer that is said every day. Eventually, one not onlymemorizes the words, but learns to say them automatically. After one hasrecited the Amidah three times daily for a few years, one can literally say theprayer without thinking. While this is a danger, it is also a great advantage. Thedanger is that the mind will drift away from the words and the prayer willbecome meaningless. Indeed, many people who worship every day ɹnd it verydiɽcult to keep their mind on what they are saying. If the Amidah is treatedsimply as prayer, this is a problem. However, if it is treated as a mantra, thenthe automatic nature of the recital is a great boon. The words themselvesbecome like a mantra, quieting the mind and removing from it all extraneousthought.Of course, this does not mean that one should not think about the words ofthe Amidah, but the way one thinks of the words becomes very diʃerent.Instead of thinking of them in an intellectual sense, one allows the words toresonate through the mind. It feels as if the words were conveying their messagein a nonverbal manner.Thus, when one says in the ɹrst blessing that God is “great,” one has anoverpowering experience of God’s greatness. Similarly, when one says that He is“mighty,” one experiences His inɹnite strength. Like many experiences in themeditative state, however, these feelings are difficult to describe.The Amidah is a single unit that should be said in its entirety withoutinterruption. As a practical matter, however, the ɹrst paragraph is the mostimportant part of the Amidah, and it is this section that sets the tone for the restof the prayer.For a person who has worshiped every day, making the transition to using theAmidah as a meditation may involve a change in orientation. Nevertheless, onewho knows the words well and has learned the methods of meditation in generalcan make the transition. One may have recited the Amidah for years, even fromearly childhood; the only thing necessary to learn is to say it effectively."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"However, a person who is not familiar with the Amidah will have to gothrough a preparatory period in order to memorize the words and becomefamiliar with them. This period should take a minimum of thirty days. It may bediɽcult for the neophyte to learn the entire Amidah that perfectly in this shorttime. Nevertheless, the ɹrst paragraph consists of only forty-two words andtherefore can be readily learned. This paragraph itself can be the meditation,while the rest of the Amidah is then read as a prayer.If at all possible, learn this ɹrst blessing in the original Hebrew. If you canread Hebrew but do not understand the words, learn at least the translation ofthese forty-two words. If you cannot read Hebrew, try to get someone totransliterate them and learn to recite them in Hebrew. The spiritual benefits thatcan be gained from this method are so great that it would be worthwhile tolearn Hebrew for no other reason than to be able to say the Amidah in itsoriginal language.During the preparatory period, memorize the ɹrst paragraph. This isimportant because this paragraph should be said with the eyes closed. Someauthorities say that the entire Amidah should be recited by heart. Theseauthorities state that this was the reason why no prayer books were used duringthe Talmudic period. Since some people could not recite the Amidah by heart, itwas ordained that a reader would repeat the prayer aloud for those who couldnot say it by themselves.Once you have memorized the ɹrst blessing, recite it by heart as part of thethree prescribed services for at least thirty days. After this preparatory period,you should be familiar enough with the paragraph to use it as a meditativedevice.To use the Amidah as a meditation, one must be familiar with its basic rules.Indeed, a number of these rules make sense only if one looks at the Amidah as ameditation.The ɹrst rule is that the Amidah must be said at the proper time. The morningshacharith Amidah can be said from dawn until the end of the ɹrst quarter of theday (approximately 10:00 A.M.) or, in an emergency, until noon. The afternoonminchah Amidah can be said from shortly after noon until sunset. The eveningmaariv Amidah can be said from nightfall until just before dawn.Before any worship service, one must wash the hands. This is reminiscent ofthe kohen priests, who would wash their hands before performing the DivineService in the Jerusalem Temple. Washing the hands is more than merecleansing; it is a ritual puriɹcation that must be done in a prescribed manner.The washing is accomplished by pouring water from a cup or glass, ɹrst over the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"right hand and then over the left hand, washing the hands in this manner threetimes alternately.One may not recite the Amidah unless one is properly dressed. In particular,men should cover their heads with a hat or a yarmulke. It also should not be saidin the presence of other people who are not decently dressed, or where anunpleasant odor is present. Preferably it should not be said in a situation wherethere is anything that will disturb one’s concentration.By deɹnition, the Amidah is said while standing. The feet should be together,which, as the Talmud states, is the stance of the angels. The head can be slightlybowed and the hands be placed over the heart.Whenever possible, one should face Jerusalem when reciting the Amidah. Ifone is in Jerusalem, one should face the site of the Temple. The physicallocation of the Temple is a source of spiritual energy, and facing in this directionhelps draw this energy from the site of the Holy of Holies. According to ancienttradition, this was the place that Jacob called “the gate of heaven” (Gen. 28:17),and as such, it is the primary source of spiritual energy.When one says the word “blessed” (barukh) at the beginning and end of theɹrst paragraph, one should bend the knees. When one says the next word, “areyou” (attah), one should bow down from the waist. This bowing is repeatedagain at the beginning and end of the Modim, which is the next-to-last section ofthe Amidah.Bowing is integral to getting oneself into the meditative state. According tothe Talmud, one bows down fairly quickly but then comes up very slowly, “likea snake.” The commentaries explain that this means raising ɹrst the head andthen the rest of the body. When one comes up in this manner, it slows thebody’s tempo and puts the mind in a quieter framework. It thus has the eʃect ofquieting the mind and making it more receptive for meditation.With the exception of bowing, it is preferable to remain absolutely motionlessduring the Amidah. Some people have the habit of shaking and swaying duringthis prayer, but the codes of Jewish law regard this more as a nervous habitthan as a means of improving one’s concentration. Both the Kabbalists and manymajor codifiers state explicitly that all motion should be avoided in the Amidah.If you ɹnd it impossible to remain absolutely still, you may sway very lightly,but excessive shaking or swaying tends to impair concentration in a meditativesense.It is also important to close the eyes in the Amidah, especially during the ɹrstblessing, in order to get yourself into a meditative state. If you do not know therest of the Amidah by heart, it can be said from a prayerbook."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The words of the Amidah should be said quietly, either in a very soft voice orin a quiet whisper. The voice should be directed inward rather than outward.These methods will make the Amidah a more eʃective instrument of worship.If the Amidah is also to be a meditation, there is one more important condition,and this has to do with the pace at which the words are said. The Talmud relatesthat the “original saints” (chasidim rishonim) used to take one hour to recite theAmidah. From the context, as well as from a number of Kabbalistic sources, it isobvious that these original saints used the Amidah as a meditation. This teachingprovides an important clue to the pace at which the Amidah is to be said if it isto be used as a meditative device. A simple count shows that the entire Amidahcontains approximately 500 words. The original saints took an hour to say it, orsome 3,600 seconds. Therefore, they said this prayer at a pace of approximatelyone word every seven seconds.To say the entire Amidah at this pace is a highly advanced form of meditation.However, this pace is not diɽcult to maintain for the ɹrst paragraph, which isthe most important. Since the ɹrst blessing contains forty-two words, to say it atthe rate of a word every seven seconds would take just under ɹve minutes. Thisis a reasonable time, yet long enough to put one into a deep meditative state.This pace has the eʃect of quieting the mind in a most profound manner. It isa meditative state that appears subjectively to be very diʃerent than thatobtained through ordinary mantra meditation or contemplation because thewords one is saying define the meditation at every point.There are two basic ways in which you can pace the recitation of the words.You can draw out each word as long as possible and then pause brieɻy to let themeaning sink in. Alternatively, you can recite the word and then wait for sevenseconds before saying the next word. Each method is eʃective in its own way,and either can be used, depending on your preference.While reciting a word, and for the period afterward, do not think of anythingother than the simple meaning of the word. (The significance of the words of theɹrst paragraph of the Amidah will be discussed in the next chapter.) Allow thewords to penetrate your inner being, opening yourself to feel and see themeaning of each word. During the pause between words, the mind is hushed inanticipation of the next word and then cleared of all other thought.Once you have said the ɹrst blessing in this manner, the rest of the Amidahɻows easily. It is then a simple matter to recite the entire Amidah with a feelingof closeness to God and without any extraneous thoughts.Some people ɹnd it beneɹcial to combine the Amidah with a visualizationtechnique. Some sources indicate that while reciting the ɹrst paragraph, one"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"should attempt to visualize pure white light. Other sources state that one shouldvisualize the letters of the Tetragrammaton. Still another source teaches that itis beneɹcial to visualize nothingness while saying this paragraph. The personwho is familiar with these techniques may ɹnd them beneɹcial in enhancing themeditative experience of the Amidah. Another alternative is to concentrate onthe spontaneous images that arise in the mind’s eye.Eventually, however, one learns that the most powerful technique of all is touse the words of the Amidah and nothing else. When the words will the mind,one becomes oblivious to all other thought. The words draw the person to God,and the mind becomes completely ɹlled with the Divine. In this manner, theAmidah can bring a person to some of the most profound spiritual experiencespossible. Since it was composed for this purpose, this is by no means surprising."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"12RELATING TO GODAs we discussed in the previous chapter, the ɹrst paragraph of the Amidah isthe most important element of the service for use as a meditation. Moreover,this blessing deɹnes the I–Thou relationship between the worshiper and God.Let us explore this paragraph word by word.The first blessing of the Amidah is:Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God and God of our fathers,God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob,Great, mighty, and awesome God, Highest God,Doer of good, kind deeds, Master of all,Who remembers the love of the Patriarchs and brings a redeemer to their children’s children for His name’s sake, with love.King, Helper, Rescuer, and Shield.Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.The ɹrst word of the Amidah is “blessed,” barukh in Hebrew. It is diɽcult tounderstand what the term “blessed” means when applied to God. A person canbe blessed to have life, health, prosperity, children, and other beneɹts. But whatdoes it mean when we say that God is blessed?If we look at blessings in the Bible, we always ɹnd that God is giving therecipient of the blessing some good or beneɹt. For example, Isaac says to Jacob,“May God give you from the dew of heaven and from the fat of the earth ...”(Gen. 27:28). The main point of this and other blessings in the Bible is that Godwill be granting the recipient a special providence and that He will have a"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"special relationship and closeness to the one receiving the blessing.A blessing is therefore an expression of God’s immanence. When we say thatGod is “blessed,” we are saying that His immanent presence is the source of allblessing. This implies that God is close—very close—to us. Many Jewish sourcesindicate that the word “blessed” speciɹcally denotes God’s immanence in theworld.When we recite the word “blessed” (barukh) in the Amidah, we should beaware that God is very close, permeating the very air around us. We should feelGod in our bones, in our ɻesh, in our minds, in the deepest recesses of our souls.We should also be aware that God makes Himself available in order to enhanceour closeness to Him.The next word is “You,” attah in Hebrew. This word refers to the I–Thourelationship that we have with God. Simply saying “You” to God makes usaware that we are speaking directly to Him. When we say this word, we shouldbe aware of the Divine directly in front of us and feel all the love, strength, andawe that exist when we confront the Divine.Then comes God’s name, which in Hebrew is pronounced Adonoy. This nameis actually written as the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, but since this most holy namemay not be pronounced, the name Adonoy, which means “my Lord,” issubstituted. This substitution teaches us some very important lessons about theDivine.The meaning of the Tetragrammaton on one level has been discussed inchapter 7. However, there is another way of understanding this name on aneven deeper level.The codes note that the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, appears to be related to thepast, present, and future of the Hebrew verb “to be”; in Hebrew, “was” is hayah,“is” is hoveh, and “will be” is yihyeh. Therefore, the codes state, when one seesthe Tetragrammaton, one should have in mind that God “was, is, and will be”—all at once. This indicates that God is utterly transcendental, higher even thanthe realm of time. God exists in a realm where time does not exist.This also implies that God is totally diʃerent from anything else in creation.We cannot even begin to imagine a being existing outside of space, for whomthe very concept of space does not apply. It is even more diɽcult to imagine abeing who exists outside of time, so much so that past, present, and future areall the same to Him. Our very thought processes are dependent on time and canfunction only within the framework of time. Yet none of this applies to God.Of course, even to use the word “being” with relation to God is a misnomerand anthropomorphism. The only reason that we think of God as a “being” is so"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"that we can speak to Him, and “being” is the only category into which we can ɹtthat to which we can speak. Of course, the fact that “being” is the closestcategory into which we can place God does not mean that He is a being. As wehave discussed earlier, there is no category into which we can place God.There are two major supercategories in our minds into which all things can beplaced: that of things and that of relationships or states. If we could place God inthe category of things, then we would speak of Him as a being. However, if weplaced Him in the category of relationships, we would speak of Him as aprinciple. Thus, when we say that “God is the creator of the universe,” we arespeaking of Him as a being. On the other hand, when we say, “God is thecreative force in the universe,” we are speaking of Him as a principle.The ɹrst time I used this concept in a class, one of my students asked a simplebut very tricky question: “If God exists outside of space, how can we say thatGod is everywhere?” After a few moments of thought, the idea struck me. Iasked the class, “Does the equation 1 + 1 = 2 exist in space?”The class’s response was that this equation obviously does not exist in space.The equation 1 + 1 = 2 is not a thing that can exist in space, but rather amathematical relationship. It is a mathematical principle, and as such, it exists inthe world of ideas, and not in space.Then I asked another question: “Is there any place where 1 + 1 = 2 does notexist?”The obvious answer was no. Wherever one would go in the entire universe—and beyond—one would ɹnd that 1 + 1 = 2. This simple equation is a goodexample of something that does not exist in space and yet, at the same time,exists everywhere. This is true of every universal principle. By nature, anabstract principle is not spatial and therefore exists outside of space. Yet, if weare speaking of a universal principle, such as any of the principles ofmathematics, there is no place where it does not exist.For many purposes, it would be useful to think of God as a principle ratherthan a being. For one thing, it would make it readily understandable how Heexists outside of space and time, and yet ɹlls all space and time. For another, anidea such as this breaks down the anthropomorphic ideas that people have aboutGod.One may be tempted to say, “God is a principle.” However, as I discussedearlier, the sentence “God is ...” is a statement that cannot be completed. God isthe creator of all categories and therefore cannot ɹt into any of them. Both“principle” and “being” are approximations that we use because the mind has nocategory into which it can place God. It may be that a third, intermediate"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"category might be a better approximation, but the mind has no example of it,and therefore, such a category cannot be imagined. Nevertheless, throughmeditation, one can gain a glimmer of the nature of this third category.The Tetragrammaton appears to relate to God as a principle rather than as abeing. It denotes God’s existence in the past, the present, and the futuresimultaneously, just like that of any other principle. Earlier, I discussed how theTetragrammaton denotes the four steps in the process through which God givesexistence to His creation (see chapter 8). In this respect, we are also seeing theTetragrammaton as describing God as the creative principle.Nevertheless, it is not easy to relate to a principle, which appears totallyimpersonal, and indeed is. In prayer and worship, it is much easier to relate toGod as a being. Therefore, we do not pronounce the Tetragrammaton, butinstead substitute Adonoy, “my Lord.” This indicates that God is Lord and Masterof all creation. In seeing God as Lord and Master, we are viewing Him as a beingrather than as a principle. Mastery and dominance are anthropomorphicconcepts that are most fitting to a sentient being.As we reach the name of God that is written as the Tetragrammaton andpronounced Adonoy, we become aware that we are addressing a Being-Principle.We see God as the Principle that gives existence to all things. Yet, at the sametime, we see God as a Being, and furthermore, as a Being to whom we canrelate. When we speak to God, it is as if we are communing with existenceitself, but at the same time speaking to it as if it were a person. At the sametime, we realize that God is more than existence, actually the principle thatallows existence to be.When we pronounce God’s name, Adonoy, we are aware that we areaddressing the Inɹnite Being who is the absolute Other. The very next word,however, is Elohenu, which is translated as “our God.” This shows the extent towhich God allows us to relate to Him and draw close. As far above us as He is,He allows us to address Him as “our God”—as if, in a sense, He belonged to us.This is perhaps the greatest gift and miracle of all—that God allows us to callHim “ours.”The full expression in which we address God as ours is “our God and God ofour fathers” (Elohenu ve-Elohey avotenu). The Baal Shem Tov explains thisexpression in the following manner:There are two ways in which we can know God. First, we know about Godbecause we have heard about Him from others. We have inherited a traditionabout God from our fathers, from our ancestors, and from all the great people ofthe past."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"This, however, is not enough. No matter how much a person may have heardabout God, he must also have his own personal experience of God. Unless aperson has experienced God for himself, he will never have any true idea ofwhat God is. In a way, it is like love. If you have ever been in love, then youknow what I mean when I speak about love. But if you have never been in love,the word is totally abstract. You may imagine that love is something very nice,but you have no experience of it. Even if you read what poets sing about love,you can understand it only on the most abstract level. However, if you haveever been in love, the word will have very powerful connotations for you.The same is true of God. If you have experienced closeness to God even oncein your life, then when I speak about God, you know exactly what I mean, andthe concept has a very strong spiritual connotation. But if you have never hadthis experience, then God is something very abstract and can be described onlyon an intellectual level. We can speak about God, argue about Him, and evendebate His existence. However, if you have ever experienced God, then there isnothing to talk about. As soon as I mention the word “God,” you know exactlywhat I am speaking about, since God is as much part of your experience as He isof mine. One who has never been in love might argue that love does not exist.The same is true of one who has never experienced God. But for one who hashad the experience, there is no question.When one experiences God, however, there is always the danger that it is afalse experience. That is, you may think that you are experiencing God, but youmay actually be experiencing something very different.It is for this reason that we say “and God of our fathers.” The experience ofGod is not something that we are inventing, something that has no relation toour past. Rather, it is part of a tradition that goes back to our earliest ancestors.We aɽrm that we are not going oʃ in our quest for God on our own, but doingso as part of an unbroken chain of tradition.We then say, “God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.” We mentionthe Patriarchs because we see them as having attained the ultimate experienceof God. For them the experience of God was so strong that they were willing tochallenge their environment and change their lives because of it, becoming thespiritual trailblazers for millions that followed them. At this opening point in theAmidah, we attempt to direct our consciousness to the level of closeness to Godthat the Patriarchs had experienced.It is taught that Abraham’s primary experience of God was that of Hisgreatness, whereas Isaac experienced God’s strength and Jacob experienced Hisawesomeness. Thus, the peak experiences of the Patriarchs correspond to the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"next three expressions in the Amidah, “the great, mighty, and awesome God.”When one says that God is “great” (ha-gadol) in the Amidah, one shouldconcentrate on greatness and immensity. Try to imagine how great God is. Thinkof the size of the largest thing you can imagine. Then go further and try toimagine the size of the planet Earth. Continue, and imagine the size of the sun,the solar system, the galaxy, and then the entire universe. Then realize how tinythis all is in comparison with the greatness of God. Compared with Him, theentire universe is less than a mote of dust.This, of course, is contemplation on an intellectual level, and during theAmidah is not the time for such intellectualizing. When we say the expression“the great,” we have to take the concept of greatness beyond the intellectuallevel. The mind expands with the concept of greatness and becomes aware ofgreatness and bigness in its purest and most abstract form. The concept ofgreatness reverberates through ones entire being, and one can then catch aglimpse of what it means in relation to God.In Kabbalah, God’s greatness is closely associated with His love (chesed).When we imagine an Inɹnite Being ready to listen to the voice of aninɹnitesimal creature, we realize that there can be no greater love. Thus, in thegreatness, there is also love. This is another reason that Abraham is associatedwith God’s attribute of greatness and love. It is taught that Abraham directed hislife to emulate God’s love. Abraham was an important personage in his time,with suɽcient status to rub shoulders with kings and monarchs. Nevertheless,he would literally run to greet and serve even the lowliest of wayfarers (seeGen. 18:3,4).The next word is “the mighty” (ha-gibbor). When one says this word, oneshould think of God’s strength. Earlier, I mentioned how one can look at onesown hand and see the strength in it. When one says the word “the mighty,” oneshould likewise concentrate on strength in its pure form. When one thinks aboutstrength in terms of God, it expands until it overwhelms the mind. One thenbegins to have an inkling of strength as it applies to God.Finally, we say, “and the awesome” (ve-ha-norah). This emulates theexperience of Jacob at Bethel after he saw the vision of God and the ladder,when he said, “How awesome is this place!” (Gen. 28:17). When one is aware ofGods greatness and strength, one is overcome with a feeling of awe. Rather thanbeing a frightening experience, it is a sweet and beautiful awe, the awe thatcomes from standing in the presence of the Infinite.The next phrase is “highest God” (El Elyon). This expression is designated tomake us realize that when we say that God is “great, mighty, and awesome,”"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"these adjectives are not meant to limit Him in any way, but merely name theemotions and experiences that we have when we try to draw close to God.When one attempts to approach God, as we do in the Amidah, one ɹrst has asensation of inɹnite greatness, then a feeling of inɹnite strength, and ɹnally afeeling of overwhelming awe.It is important to realize that God is above all these. The mind must thereforesoar above greatness, above strength, above awe, and realize that Godtranscends any thought that we can possibly have. God is beyond the sky,beyond the stars, beyond the heavens, and even beyond the spiritual realm.This last concept is important to reiterate. Often people speak of God as aSpirit or as being spiritual. However, God is above the spiritual just as He isabove the physical. Just as He is the creator of the concept of the physical, He isalso the creator of the concept of the spiritual. As creator of the spiritual, Hecannot be encompassed by it. Therefore, as high as our concept of God may be,it cannot even begin to come close to His true essence. The Amidah puts thisvery succinctly when it refers to Him as “highest God.”Immediately after saying that God is the ineʃable “highest God,” we say thatHe is the “Doer of good, kind deeds.” Although God is higher than any thoughtcan conceive, He still does things that we can perceive as being kind and good.Therefore, when we say these words, we are aware of Gods inɹnite goodnessand kindness.This is very closely related to a Talmudic teaching: “Wherever you ɹndmention of Gods greatness, you also ɹnd mention of His humility.” What theTalmud is saying is that an Inɹnite Being is not limited by any humanconception of greatness or smallness. God is so great that to Him a galaxy is nomore signiɹcant than a bacterium. At the same time, He is great enough that asingle human being can be as significant to Him as an entire universe.After this, we speak of God as koney ha-kol, which has been translated as“Master of all,” but which would be more literally translated as “Owner of all.”Just as an owner can do as he pleases with his property, so God can do as Hewills with all things. All creation is God’s property, and He can do with it as Hewills. Moreover, an owner takes possession of his property and associates itwith his person. In a certain sense, anything a person owns is an extension of theself. In a similar manner, God associates Himself with His creation, and Hisessence permeates all existence.The Amidah then links the past to the future, saying that God “remembers thelove of the Patriarchs and brings a redeemer to their children’s children....” Godthus shares our memory of the past, especially with regard to the Patriarchs,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"who were the ɹrst ones to bring God consciousness to the world. Just as welook to the Patriarchs for a paradigm of the God experience, God looks at theirlove for Him as a paradigm, and as a reason to remain close to their descendantsno matter what happens.We also see God as our hope in the future—no small thing in this age overwhich hangs a Damocles’ sword of nuclear destruction. We believe that God willbring a redeemer, who will make the world a safe and sane place to live. Wehave faith that there will come a time when all humanity will be brought backto the God consciousness that the Patriarchs enjoyed and that this will be a timeof universal peace and good for all humankind. This is our ultimate hope in thefuture.We conclude by saying that God remembers the Patriarchs and will bring aredeemer “for His names sake.” As we discussed earlier, God’s name is muchmore than an arbitrary collection of sounds. Rather, it is a word that speaks ofHis essence and His relationship with creation. The name is an important focusof our God consciousness, as I have discussed in previous chapters.God’s name also ɹgures both in the lives of the Patriarchs and in our hope inthe future. The experience of the Patriarchs was always closely linked to God’sname. The Torah tells that Abraham began his career by “calling in the name ofGod” (Gen. 12:8). The Patriarchs were thus the ones who initiated Godconsciousness to the world through His name. Not only did they link themselvesto the Infinite, but they also identified It with a name.The process begun by the Patriarchs will be completed by the promisedredeemer, who will bring God’s name to all humanity. One of the importantprophecies regarding the messianic future is that “On that day, God will be Oneand His Name One” (Zech. 14:9). Not only will the entire world worship God,but everyone will call Him by the same name. This will indicate that the wholeworld will have the same God consciousness as the heirs of the Patriarchs. TheAmidah expresses this by stating that the entire process will be “for His name’ssake.”The initial portion ends with the expression “with love” (be-ahavah). It is lovethat bridges the gap between the past and future—even as love bridges the gapbetween man and woman. In a sense, the past and future can be looked upon asa male and a female. Just as the male impregnates the female, the pastimpregnates the future. The redemption in the future will come from thememory of the Patriarchs in the past. It is God’s love spanning the chasm oftime.Moreover, God causes the processes of history to unfold, the goal being the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"perfection of humanity and society. This entire process is governed by love. Wemake ourselves aware of God’s love at this point in the Amidah, and are totallysaturated by it.The ɹrst paragraph in the Amidah concludes with four words that aredesignated to bring God closer to the worshiper. These four words are “King,Helper, Rescuer, and Shield.” Whereas in the ɹrst part of this paragraph werelate to God in a general manner, here we develop our personal relationshipwith Him.These four words are the key to the entire Amidah. If one says them correctly,one is left in a perfect spiritual space for the rest of the service. Even if one hassaid the ɹrst parts of this paragraph without proper concentration, if these fourwords are said properly, they will bring the worshiper to such a closeness toGod that the rest of the Amidah will be perfect. If one cannot say the entire ɹrstparagraph at the rate of seven seconds per word, as mentioned earlier, oneshould at least do so for these four words.Let us look at these four words in detail.The ɹrst word is “King” (Melekh). We begin by looking at God as our king andat our relationship to Him as that of a subject to a king. A king is far away, inhis capital city, in his palace. If you want something from the king, you mustsend him a formal request, and it goes through his staʃ, his ministers, hissecretary. Then, if you are lucky, after a few months you may get a reply.Therefore, when we address God as King, we see Him as majestic but distant.Help is available from him, but not closely available.In the next word, we address God as “Helper” (Ozer). Now we see him asmuch closer than a king. A “helper” is someone whom we can readily approach.He is a friend whom we know we can always call on and who always will makehimself available. Therefore, when we call God “Helper,” we realize that we cancall on Him at any time and He will be there for us. This is a relationship muchcloser than that to a king. In saying this word, we are beginning the processthrough which we draw closer to God.Third, we address God as “Rescuer” (Moshia). Again, a rescuer is much closerthan a helper. A rescuer is someone who is available to save you when you aredrowning in a river; he is right there to jump in and pull you out. A helper mayhave the best intentions in the world, but if he is not close to you at all times,he cannot save you when you are in danger. Therefore, when we speak to Godas our “Rescuer,” we see Him as being available whenever we need Him, readyto rescue us in an instant. We recognize that God is always close enough to helpus, even when we are in imminent danger. Thus, the relationship of Rescuer is"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"much closer than that of Helper. This word brings us yet a step closer to God.Finally, we speak to God as our “Shield” (Magen). A shield is even closer thana rescuer. A shield can help even when an arrow is ɻying at me and there isnothing else that can stop it. When the arrow is ɻying, there is no time for eventhe rescuer to intercept it. The shield must be there in place—right in front ofme. Thus, when I address God as my “Shield,” I can feel Him right in front ofme. God is all around me, surrounding me like a suit of divine armor. I amtotally aware of God’s protective power, surrounding me on all sides. I feel thatI am being protected by God, so that nothing in the world can harm me.Thus, in the four words “King, Helper, Rescuer, and Shield,” we become moreand more aware of Gods closeness. First we see Him as a benevolent but distantking, then as a willing helper, then as an nearby rescuer, and ɹnally, as animmanent shield. In these four words, we make the transition from viewing Godas a remote transcendental force to seeing Him as a protector who is closer thanthe air around us.The one person who reached the level where he could constantly see God ashis shield was Abraham. God had told him, “Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield toyou” (Gen. 15:1). From that time on, Abraham had a constant perception of Godas his shield. He was always aware of God being very close to him, surroundinghim and protecting him on a most immanent and direct level.It is for this reason that the ɹrst paragraph ends with the blessing “Blessed areYou, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.” It makes us aware that such a level of Godconsciousness exists and that it can even be woven into a way of life, as in thecase of Abraham. Of all the levels of relationship to God, the level of shield isthe closest. Here we see God close enough to us to stop even a flying bullet. Thiswas the level attained by Abraham, and at this point in the Amidah, we aspire toit.The word “blessed” (barukh) occurs twice in this ɹrst paragraph. Theparagraph begins with the word “blessed,” and then it is repeated in the ending,“Blessed are You, Adonoy, Shield of Abraham.” It is signiɹcant that it wasordained that we bow at each of these points.As discussed earlier, the word “blessed” indicates God’s immanence and Hispower of blessing, which permeates all creation. We bow when we say “blessed”to indicate that we are aware of this immanence. We feel that God is directly infront of us, and we are bowing to this Presence.By the time we reach the end of the paragraph, we have raised ourconsciousness of God’s immanence considerably. At the beginning of theblessing, we were aware of God’s immanence, but only in an abstract sense. At"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"the end, our consciousness of God’s immanence is such that it is as tangible andpalpable as a shield. To indicate our new awareness, we bow a second time.There are two other places at which we also bow in the Amidah. These are atthe beginning and end of the blessing of thanksgiving (Modim), which is thesecond-from-the-last section of the Amidah. To understand the reason for this,we must first understand the structure of the Amidah as a whole.It is taught that the essential structure of any prayer should contain threeelements—adoration, petition, and thanksgiving, in that order. This structure ismaintained in the Amidah. The ɹrst three paragraphs consist of adoration,wherein we establish a degree of God consciousness in the mind. The ɹrstparagraph is the key to this process, as we have seen.The second general part of the Amidah is that of petition, wherein we ask Godfor certain things. This part consists of the next fourteen blessings of theAmidah. It is signiɹcant to note that in Hebrew, the number fourteen is writtenout as yod daleth (), which also spells yad, the Hebrew word for “hand.” As itwere, we are asking that our petitions be answered through God’s hand.What we are doing essentially in the petition stage is using the spiritualenergy developed in the ɹrst three blessings to bring about the things we want,both as individuals and as a nation. First we ask for our own personal needs,petitioning God for wisdom, closeness, atonement, healing, and blessing. Thenwe ask for the things that will aʃect the Israelite people as a whole. The latterpart of the petition stage thus deals primarily with redemption.According to this pattern, the Amidah should end with thanksgiving. Inthanking God, we show awareness of the closeness and spiritual energy that Heallows us to experience, and thus integrate it into our being. We would thereforeexpect the Amidah to end with the blessing of thanksgiving, or Modim, as it iscalled. Actually, however, this blessing is the second from the last.There is an important reason for this, and that is so that the Amidah can endwith a petition and blessing for peace. Once one has drawn down spiritualenergy, one can ɹnd internal peace. This internal peace can be projected toenhance national and universal peace as well. When a person can fully thankGod, in a mystical as well as a mundane sense, he is at perfect peace. Inthanking God, we also draw in the energy that is developed in the service. Thebowing acknowledges the power of God that we have drawn into our essence.Since this is the purpose of the blessing of thanksgiving, we bow once at itsbeginning and again at its end.Bowing in the Amidah also has another important connotation. The Talmudstates that one of the reasons why the Amidah has eighteen blessings is that they"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"parallel the eighteen vertebrae of the spine and neck. The nineteenth blessing,which was added later, parallels the coccyx, the small bone at the base of thespine. This brings to mind the concept of kundalini energy that is discussed inEastern teachings. This is not to suggest that there is any relationship betweenthe Jewish teaching and that of the East, but merely to point out that the spineis universally recognized as an important conduit of energy. Moreover, whereasin kundalini meditation one strives to elevate energy from the base of the spineto the head, in the Amidah one brings energy from the mind to the rest of thebody.The Talmud also teaches that if one does not bow in the blessing ofthanksgiving, one’s spine turns into a snake. Obviously this is to be taken not ina physical sense, but in a spiritual meaning. One reason the Talmud gives for thenumber of blessings corresponding to the number of vertebrae is that one mustbow low enough for each vertebra to be separated from the one next to it. TheTalmud also teaches that when one bows, one should do so like a rod, but whenone rises, one should do so like a serpent, raising the head ɹrst and then thebody.The kundalini energy is also seen as taking the form of a serpent. In Jewishtradition, however, the serpent is seen as the enemy of mankind. The serpent isthe tempter, who tries to use sexual energy’ to draw humans away from God.The Talmud therefore teaches that if one does not bow during the Amidah, thenone’s spine turns into a snake. In contrast, the posture in kundalini meditationrequires that the spine be kept perfectly straight and erect. If a person worshipsin this manner, without bowing, then his spine will become infused with thekundalini energy, which is the serpent.Bowing may be a way of overcoming this energy of the serpent. The conceptof kundalini is to bring energy up from the sexual area to the rest of the body.Bowing has the opposite connotation, namely that of bringing energy down fromthe head to the body. Therefore, when we bow, we lower the head toward thebody. Only after we have bowed, and infused the body with spiritual energy,can we rise and lift energy from the spine to the head, “rising like a snake.”In this manner, the Amidah is designed to bring spiritual energy through thespine to the entire body. This is also a reason why this prayer is said with thefeet together. As I have said, this is the stance in which angels are visualized.During the Amidah, one strives to bring oneself into an angelic mode, whereinthe spiritual becomes dominant over the physical."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"13UNIFICATIONThe most ancient and most important Jewish prayer is the Shema. This prayerconsists of the words:Shema Yisrael, Adonoy Elohenu, Adonoy Echad.Listen, Israel, Adonoy, our God, Adonoy is One.The words themselves are taken from the Torah (Deut. 6:4). In many waysthis sentence can be looked upon as the most important verse in the Torah.First, the Torah designates that it be recited twice every day, in the morning andin the evening. It is also the key element in the parchment in the tefillin that areworn during daily worship, as well as in the mezuzah that is aɽxed to thedoorpost.The Shema is more than just a prayer. It is the basic declaration of faith forthe Jew, It is one of the ɹrst things a Jew learns as a child, and the last wordsone is to say before dying. All through life, one is to say this sentence twice aday, without fail.It would seem that the Shema would be perfect to use as a mantra. TheTalmud, however, discourages this as a practice and says that one who repeatsthe Shema should be silenced. The concept of the Shema is that of unity, andtherefore it is meant to be said only once at a time.The Talmud notes that the Shema has the unique ability to dispel the forces ofevil. The Shema is said in bed, just before one goes to sleep at night. Accordingto the Talmud, night is the time when the forces of evil are strongest, and theShema has the power to protect us against them.The reason for this should be obvious: evil has power only when it is seen asdisconnected from God. If one thinks that there can be a force of evil apart fromGod, then one can be harmed by it. However, if a person recognizes that evenevil is a creation of God, then it no longer has any power over him. God Himselfsaid through His prophet, “I form light and create darkness, I make peace and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"create evil; I am God, I do all these things” (Isa. 45:7).The Zohar explains the existence of evil with a parable. A king once wanted totest his son to see if he would be a worthy heir to the throne. He told his son tokeep away from loose women and to remain virtuous. Then he hired a womanto entice his son, instructing her to use all her wiles with him. The Zohar thenasks the rhetorical question: Is the woman not also a loyal servant of the king?The purpose of evil is to tempt us and allow us to have free choice. Withoutthe existence of evil, we would have no other choice but to do good and therewould be no virtue in the good we do. But since God gave us free will and wantsus to do good as a matter of our own free choice, evil plays a highly importantrole in His plan.In the parable, as soon as the prince realizes that the woman is in the hire ofhis father, she is no longer a threat. The same is true of evil. Indeed, the BaalShem Tov goes further in using this Zoharic teaching. He says, “Do not succumbto evil; emulate it.” He explains that if evil is a loyal servant of the King, thenyou should be equally loyal. If evil does God’s will, you should strive to do itequally well.It is told that the great saint Rabbi Israel Meir ha-Kohen (1838–1933), betterknown as the Chafetz Chaim, related that he once woke up on a cold wintermorning to say his prayers. The Evil Urge said to him, “How can you get up soearly? You are already an old man, and it’s so cold outside.” The Chafetz Chaimreplied to the Evil Urge, “You’re a lot older than me, and you’re up already.”This also illustrates the concept of emulating evil rather than succumbing to it.In any case, the Shema declares that God is One. If God is One, then Hispurpose must also be One. Since God’s purpose in creation was to do good, thenthe only reason that evil exists is to enhance the world’s ultimate good. If aperson has a deep realization of this, then the forces of evil have no power overhim.A paradigm of this attitude can be found in the great Rabbi Akiva (c. 50-135C.E.). Rabbi Akiva’s watchword always was, “All that the Merciful One does is forthe good.” Rabbi Akiva faced his greatest test during the Hadrianic persecutionsof the Jews around 135 C.E. The Romans had decreed that no one could teachTorah, under penalty of death, but Rabbi Akiva ignored them and carried on hisvocation as Torah teacher. He was captured and sentenced to be killed byhaving his ɻesh torn away by curry combs, a most excruciating torture. Still,while he was being tortured to death in this manner, he told his students that hewas happy, since he had been given the opportunity to suʃer and die as anexpression of his love for God. Death and torture held no terror for him, since"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"he had a love that was more powerful than death.Signiɹcantly, Rabbi Akiva’s last words were the Shema. Even in the midst ofhis most terrible suʃering, he was able to see God’s unity and oneness, andtherefore he could see God even in his suʃering. Rabbi Akiva had been a studentof Nachum Ish Gamzu for twenty-two years. Nachum was called Gamzu because,no matter what happened to him, he would say, “This too [gam zu] is for thegood.” Like his student, Nachum suʃered terribly during his lifetime, but nomatter what happened to him, he was able to see it as good.The Shema is an integral part of the morning shacharith and evening maarivservice. Together with a number of important prayers that surround it, it is saidimmediately before the Amidah. However, the Shema can also be said alone, asan important meditation in its own right.From the wording itself, it is obvious that the Shema was meant to be ameditation. If the only signiɹcance of the Shema were to declare that God isOne, then the opening words, “Listen, Israel,” would be redundant. But theShema itself is telling us to listen—to listen and hear the message with everyɹber of our being. It is telling us to open our perceptions completely, so as toexperience God’s unity.It is also signiɹcant that the name Israel is used in the beginning of thedeclaration. This name was given to Jacob after he wrestled with the angel onhis way home to Canaan. According to the Torah, the name Israel means “hewho contends with the Divine” (Gen. 32:29).In the Midrash and the Zohar, there is discussion about whether the angelwith which Jacob wrestled was a good angel or an evil one. But the main pointis that when a person contends with the spiritual, he is opening himself up toboth good and evil, which means wrestling with the forces of good as well asthose of evil.A number of commentaries see Jacob’s experience as having taken place in ameditative state. Jacob did not physically wrestle with an angel, but heperceived a spiritual being while meditating. The name Israel that Jacobreceived would then pertain to his entering into a spiritual state and contendingwith his experiences there.It is precisely when one is in a meditative state that one has contact with thespiritual on an intimate level. The Shema addresses itself to such a seeker andcalls him by the name Israel. The Shema is addressing the “Israel” in each one ofus. This “Israel” is the part of us that yearns to transcend the boundaries of thephysical and seeks out the spiritual. The Shema tells this “Israel” to listen—toquiet down the mind completely and open it up to a universal message of God’s"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"unity. However, the only time a person can listen perfectly, without anyinterference, is in the meditative state.The Shema then says, “Adonoy, our God” (Adonoy Elohenu). This is the sameexpression encountered earlier in the previous chapter, in our discussion of theAmidah. As mentioned there, we recognize that God is a totally diʃerent entityWho exists outside even the realms of space and time. When we say “Adonoy,”we are speaking of that for which the mind does not even have a category. Yet,in the very next word, we call Adonoy “our God.” We recognize that we canrelate to God and experience His closeness to such an extent that we can callHim ours.This is a very remarkable concept: we can think about the Inɹnite and stillcall It ours. The fact that God allows us to call Him “our God” is the greatestpossible gift.The Shema ends with “Adonoy is One” (Adonoy Echad). Here we are sayingthat no matter how many diʃerent ways we experience the Divine, they are allOne and all have one source. We recognize that there is a basic Oneness in theuniverse and beyond, and in our search for the transcendental, it is precisely thisOneness that we are seeking. We see in God the most absolute Unity imaginable,the Oneness that unifies all creation.The more we realize this, the more we begin to see that on an ultimate levelthere is no plurality. If there is no plurality, then we are also one with God.When saying the word “One” (Echad) in the Shema, one can realize this in adeep sense.An objection might be raised here. If a person is one with God, how can hecontinue to exist? If he is one with God, then there is no room left for him tohave an independent personality. How is it possible for a person to everexperience this oneness with God? The answer is that this situation is a paradox.To say that I exist and that God exists, and that I am one with God, is like saying1 + 1 = 1, which is, of course, logically impossible.Nevertheless, we cannot say that logic is higher than God. Quite the contrary.Just as God created everything else, He also created logic. Logic is a tool ofGod’s, but He is never bound by it. Therefore, if He wants one plus one to beone, it is no problem for Him. And if He wants a person to be one with Him,and still be able to experience it, it is also possible for Him.This principle allows us to understand all theological paradoxes. To a largedegree, in creating the world, God bound Himself by logic. Since He createdman in “His image,” man uses the same logic that went into creation and cantherefore understand God’s creation. However, when it suits God’s purpose in"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"creation to transcend logic, He can also do so, and this is what we perceive asparadox. Indeed, the concept of Divine will itself is a paradox. If God is theCreator of all things, then He must also be the Creator of the very concept ofwill. But how could God create will without this in itself being an act of will? Ina sense, the creation of will is by its very nature paradoxical, like trying to pullyourself up by your own bootstraps.The most powerful expression of will is love. This is also an integral part ofthe Shema. Every Hebrew letter has a numerical value corresponding to itsposition in the alphabet. The value of echad (), the Hebrew word for “one,”is thirteen (1 + 8 + 4). This, however, is the numerical value of ahavah (,1 + 5 + 2 + 5), the Hebrew word for “love.” Love is the power that breaksdown barriers and uniɹes opposites. Two people who are deeply in love becomeone. The Torah says, “A man shall leave his father and mother, and attachhimself to his wife, and they shall become one ɻesh” (Gen. 2:24). But the loveand unity between God and man is greater than any possible between man andwoman.There are a number of prayers or “blessings” that surround the Shema when itis said as part of the morning service. The last words before the Shema itself are“Blessed are You, Adonoy, who chose His people Israel in love.” Therefore, theword immediately before the Shema is the word “love,” in the context of ablessing that speaks of the love that God has for His people.Immediately after the Shema is the commandment “You shall love God yourLord with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deut.6:5). This commandment speaks of the love that we must have for God.Therefore, the Shema is placed between two loves—God’s love for us and ourlove for God. Both of these loves suggest the unity to be found in the Shema.The Shema can be said as a prayer or a declaration of faith, and it is said assuch by Jews all over the world. But if the words are said very slowly, and if aperson prepares himself mentally, the Shema can be an extremely powerfulmeditation. Indeed, the Torah itself prescribes that the Shema be said twicedaily, and it seems highly probable that this was originally prescribed as a shortdaily meditation for all Israel.The technique consists in saying the words very slowly, in a manner verysimilar to that of using the Amidah for a meditation. In the Amidah, as noted inchapter 11, the prescribed rate was approximately one word every sevenseconds. The Shema can be said even more slowly. You can dwell on each wordfor as long as ɹfteen or twenty seconds, or with experience, even longer. Duringthe silences between words, let the meaning of each word penetrate your"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"innermost being.It is easier to use the Shema as a meditation than the Amidah, since the mainportion of the Shema consists of only six words, which are easy to memorize.Before you can use these words as a meditation, you must know them well andby heart. You should be seated while saying the Shema and keep your eyesclosed. Strive to be perfectly still, with no body motion whatsoever.The Shema can be used as a meditation either as part of the regular servicesor alone. It is preferable to say it as part of the service, especially the morningservice, which provides a proper setting and introduction to the Shema. In thisservice, the Shema is preceded by two prayers, or “blessings,” as the Talmudcalls them. The ɹrst blessing begins with a description of the astronomicalworld. The mind soars to the sun, the moon, the stars, and beyond, andcontemplates the vast reaches of space, immense beyond comprehension. Yet,while one meditates on the vastness of the astronomical world, one sees it as allworking to do God’s will.The mind then transcends the astronomical world and reaches up to thespiritual realm, to the world of the angels. We join the angels in their dailypraise to God: “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts, the whole world is ɹlledwith His glory” (Isa. 6:3) and then, “Blessed be God’s glory from His place”(Ezek. 3:12). One’s mind reaches higher and higher, joining the highest angels intheir quest for the Divine.Then one enters the second blessing, which speaks of the “World of Love.”Here we meditate on the love that God has shown us and how He drew us closeto Him through the Torah and the commandments. We become aware of thislove and meditate on it, drawing it into our innermost being. Then, we recitethe Shema itself.When the Shema is said as part of the morning service, one automatically goesthrough all these levels. However, even if one says the Shema alone as ameditation, one can go through all these levels as part of ones personalpreparation. In either case, the Shema becomes not only a meditation, but apeak experience of love and closeness to God.The words immediately following the Shema are usually translated in theimperative—“You shall love God, your Lord ...”—implying that this is acommandment. However, the words can equally well be translated as “You willlove God, your Lord,” as a simple statement. The words imply that if we listen,and hear the message that God is ours and that He is One, then we willautomatically love God. Love for God follows as a natural consequence to theexperience of His essence and unity."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"There is also another important element in the Shema as a meditation, andthis concerns the actual spelling of the word. The ɹrst word, shema (), isspelled shin () mem () ayin (). In the Sefer Yetzirah, the shin and mem aredescribed as two of the three “mother letters.”It is easy to understand why the shin and mem are important. The shin has thesound of s or sh, and hence, of all the letters in the alphabet, it has the soundclosest to white noise. White noise is sound that contains every possiblewavelength, and is usually heard as a hissing sound. On an oscilloscope, the ssound would appear as a totally chaotic jumble with no structure whatsoever.The opposite of white noise is pure harmonic sound. This is a hum, like thesound of a tuning fork. On an oscilloscope, this would appear as a perfect wavyline, the epitome of order and regularity. This is the sound of the mem.The shin thus represents chaos, while the mem represents harmony. The SeferYetzirah says that the shin represents ɹre, while the mem represents water. Theshin denotes a hot, chaotic state of consciousness, while the mem denotes a cool,harmonic state. This is signiɹcant, since in many meditative traditions, the msound is seen as one that leads to tranquillity and inner peace. The sound itselfseems to be conducive to the harmony that one seeks in the meditative state.The s or sh sound, on the other hand, is more closely associated with ournormal, everyday level of consciousness. It is also interesting to note that the“still small voice” (1 Kings 19:12) in which Elijah heard God is translated by theSefer Yetzirah as a “ɹne humming sound.” It appears that the m sound wasclosely associated with prophecy.Many of the Hebrew words that tend to focus the mind on a single object aremade up of these two mother letters. Thus, the Hebrew word for “name” is shem(), which is spelled shin mem. Similarly, the word for “there” is sham ().Both of these words have the connotation of the transition from the chaos of thegeneral to the harmony of the particular. A name separates a single object fromthe chaos of all objects, while “there” separates a place from the chaos of allplaces. Both words therefore denote the transition from the concept of the shinto that of the mem.An exercise discussed by the commentaries on the Sefer Yetzirah has beenfound eʃective for getting into the meditative state quickly and simply. Itconsists of alternating the sounds of the shin and the mem. First pronounce onesound for the period of normal exhalation, then inhale and pronounce the otherfor the same period of time. The pattern is: “ssssss,” inhale, “mmmmmm,”inhale, “ssssss,” inhale, “mmmmmm,” inhale, and so on. The inhalation is silentand represents the third mother letter, the silent alef (). This meditative"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"method of alternating between the s and m sounds draws one deeper and deeperinto the m sound. If one practices this exercise for a period of time, one canattain the ability to get into the meditative state merely by humming the msound.The fact that the ɹrst two letters of the Shema are shin and mem is highlysigniɹcant. True listening involves a transition from normal “shin” consciousnessto meditative “mem” consciousness. This can be accomplished in the very ɹrstword of the Shema.Shema () is spelled shin () mem () ayin (). The Zohar states that thelast letter, the ayin, is signiɹcant because it has a numerical value of seventy. Ingeneral, seventy is seen as representing plurality as it exists in the mundaneworld. Therefore, the ayin represents the seventy diʃerent forces of creation.These seventy forces are manifest in the seventy nations and seventy languages,as well as the seventy descendants who accompanied Jacob to Egypt. Inlistening to the message of unity in the Shema, one brings these seventy forcesinto the ear and mind, and unifies them with the Divine.The Shema can be understood on many levels. However, as a meditation, themain thing is to allow the simple meaning of each word to penetrate the mind.One must understand the words, not with the intellect, but with the soul."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"14THE LADDEROne of the most vivid scenes in the Torah is that of Jacob’s dream, in which hesaw “a ladder standing on earth, with its top reaching heaven” (Gen. 28:12).There is a midrash that teaches that this ladder had four steps. According to thegreat Jewish mystics, they represent the fours steps one must climb to reach thehighest level of the spiritual domain.It is taught that these four steps represent the four levels of meditationalinvolvement: action, speech, thought, and the level above thought. As we havediscussed, the level above thought is experienced as nothingness.These four levels also parallel the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, YHVH ()(see chapter 7).The ɹrst level is that of action, where we are still involved with our body.This parallels the ɹnal heh () of the Tetragrammaton, which is the hand thatreceives. It is through the body that we receive all blessing from God. The“hand” that God gives us to receive His energy is the body, which He created inthe Divine image. So the ɹrst and lowest level is involvement with the body andaction.The second level is that of speech. On the level of speech, we can be awarethat we are communicating with the Divine. Speech is the angelic power in man,through which we can transcend our animal nature. Moreover, speech bridgesthe gap between the physical and the spiritual, and between man and God.Therefore, the level of speech parallels the vav () of the Tetragrammaton, whichis the arm with which God reaches out to us. Vav has the connotation ofconnection, and this parallels speech, which connects God and man.The third level is that of thought. It is through the power of thought that wegrasp what we can of the Divine. Thought therefore parallels the ɹrst heh () ofthe Divine Name, which is God’s “hand that holds.” Thought is the “hand thatholds” every experience of the Divine that we can experience.Finally, there is the level above thought, which is experienced as nothingness.This is the ineʃable experience of the Divine itself. This is the experience that"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"we have only when all thought is turned oʃ and we enter into the realm of pureexperience, which is beyond thought.The Kabbalists teach that the morning shacharith service is divided accordingto these four steps. The four divisions of the morning service are:1. The Introductory Readings2. The Verses of Praise3. The Shema and its blessings4. The AmidahWe have discussed the Shema and the Amidah in earlier chapters. Let us nowsee how they fit into the context of the rest of the service.The Introductory Readings begin with blessings in which we thank God forour physical nature. They include thanksgiving blessings for our body functions,for our ability to stand, walk, and function in the physical world.As discussed earlier, the word “blessed” when applied to God denotes Hisimmanence in the world. When we recite the blessings for bodily functions, weare sensitizing ourselves to the Divine that is immanent in our own bodies. Thus,although on this level we may not yet be in touch with our spiritual nature, webecome aware of our body as a receptacle for the spiritual. This is the level ofthe “hand that receives,” discussed earlier.The second half of the introductory section consists of readings dealing withthe sacriɹcial system. These sacriɹces consisted of both plants and animals. Tounderstand the significance of these readings in the service, one must understandthe place that sacriɹce had in ancient Israel. The Hebrew word for sacriɹce iskorban, which literally means “that which is brought close.” The animalsacrifices were thus seen as a means of drawing close to God.The Talmud teaches that man is half animal and half angel. The body is theseat of man’s animal nature, while the soul is the seat of his angelic nature.Since the body is the vessel of the soul, mans animal nature is the receptacle forhis angelic nature.There are times when man must elevate his animal nature and use it as ameans of serving God. The Torah thus says, “You shall love God your Lord withall your heart and with all your soul” (Deut. 6:5). The Talmud interprets “yourheart” to denote man’s animal nature and “your soul” to denote his angelicnature. The verse therefore teaches that both must be devoted to the love ofGod.When sacriɹce was oʃered in ancient times, it was burned on the Great Altar"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. The sacriɹce symbolized that the animal inman also has a place in serving God. Since it is the body that is the receptacle ofthe Divine, the body and animal nature must also be “brought close” to God.Therefore, the Sacriɹcial Readings in the Introductory Readings serve to makeus aware that our bodies are vessels for the Divine. At this point in the service,we are still concerned with action and the physical body, but we are beginningto connect it with the spiritual.The second part of the service is known as the Verses of Praise, and it consistsof Psalms and other biblical praises of God. This part of the service parallels thelevel of speech. In reciting these biblical verses, we are using speech to connectourselves to God. In this part of the service, we should also make ourselveskeenly aware of the process through which we speak and pronounce the words.We should concentrate on our tongue and lips, and feel how they articulate eachsound. This in itself can be a contemplation. We should also carefully listen toeach sound and each word as we speak these praises of God.This section is known in Hebrew as pesukey de-zimra, literally, “verses ofzimra.” The Hebrew word zimra has a double meaning: it can mean praise, but italso has the connotation of cutting. The Kabbalists therefore note that the versesof zimra serve to help us cut ourselves away from the physical. If man is halfanimal and half angel, then speech is uniquely associated with the angelic side ofman. Indeed, where the Torah says, “God formed man from the dust of theearth, and blew in his nostrils a breath of life so that man became a living soul”(Gen. 2:7), the Targum (the authorized Aramaic translation) translates “livingsoul” as “speaking soul.” Man’s ability to speak is closely associated with hisspiritual nature.Therefore, during this second part of the service, we become aware of ourown spirituality and the connection that we have with God. The praise we chantbrings us into the space of this connection, where we can transcend our physicalnature. All that exists for us is our speaking to God. The Jewish mysticstherefore say that one is in the “World of Speech,” since in this state, speech isones entire world.Thus, there is an important transition in the ɹrst two sections of the service.In the Introductory Readings, we are hovering over the physical world but stillattached to it. In the Verses of Praise, we begin to transcend it.The Verses of Praise conclude with the Song of the Red Sea (Exod. 15). Afterthe Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites were pursued by the Egyptians. Godrescued them by splitting the Red Sea and allowing them to cross. The Egyptianswho chased them into the sea were drowned when the sea returned to normal."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"It was only after the crossing of the Red Sea that the Israelites gained totalfreedom.The Kabbalists teach that the Egyptian Exile represents states of immature orconstricted consciousness (mochin de-katnuth). At the end of the Verses of Praisewe emerge from constricted consciousness to a state of expanded consciousness(mochin de-gadluth). This transition is made when we repeat the Song of the RedSea.After having completed the Verses of Praise, we are then ready to begin thethird part of the service, which consists of the Shema and its blessings. Thissection of the service is said to correspond to the “World of Thought.” Thespiritual ascent that we make here is in pure thought. In the Verses of Praise,thought was secondary to speech; in the Shema and its blessings, speech issecondary to thought. Here, we are in a state of expanded consciousness, wherethought is our entire world. The culmination of this section is the Shema itself,where all thought is filled with God’s unity.These ɹrst three sections of the service are also said to parallel the threelowest levels of the soul. In Hebrew, the lowest level of the soul is known asnefesh, the next is called ruach, and the highest is neshamah. The word nefeshcomes from a root denoting “rest,” and ruach means “wind,” while neshamah isassociated with breath.The Kabbalists explain the signiɹcance of these three levels using aglassblower as an analogy. In this case, the glassblower is the Divine, while thevessel is the person. The glassblowing process begins with the blower’s breath(neshimah) blowing into the tube that connects his mouth to the vessel he isblowing. This breath then travels through the glassblowing tube as a wind(ruach) until it reaches the vessel. Finally, the breath enters the vessel and formsit according to the blower’s plan, and there it comes to rest (nafash).In the case of the soul, the “blower” is the Divine. In describing the creationof man, the Torah thus says, “God formed man out of the dust of the earth, andHe blew in his nostrils a soul [neshamah] of life” (Gen. 2:7). The highest level ofthe soul is thus the neshamah, which is, as it were, the “breath of God.” This isthe “vessel” that holds the spiritual nature that God wishes to give us. Hence, itcan be said to parallel the “hand that gives,” the ɹrst heh of theTetragrammaton.The second level is ruach, which is the “wind” blowing down to us from God’sbreath. This “wind” is seen as the connection between God’s “mouth,” as itwere, and the person. Therefore, it parallels the vav of the Tetragrammaton andthe angelic world, which also denote transition. It is signiɹcant that ruach is"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"always associated with the spiritual experience, and the expression “Holy Spirit”(ruach ha-kodesh) is virtually synonymous with prophecy.Finally, there is the level of nefesh, the lowest level of the soul, where itinterfaces with the physical. This is the level where we are able to accept thespirituality that God desires to give us. Hence, it parallels the “hand thatreceives,” the ɹnal heh of the Tetragrammaton. Since this part of the soul isessentially passive rather than active, it is called nefesh, which literally meansthe “resting soul.” When the Torah speaks of punishment for certain serious sins,it says, “that soul [nefesh] shall be cut oʃ.” It speaks of the level of nefesh, thelevel of the soul through which one is able to receive spiritual sustenance fromGod. When this is cut oʃ from ruach, a person is cut oʃ from his spiritualsource.These three levels of the soul represent three levels of inner space. Onetravels through these three levels in the ɹrst three parts of the morning service.In the Introductory Readings, we gain an awareness of nefesh, the part of thesoul that interfaces with the body. This is the level of action where the persongains an awareness of the body as a receptacle for the spiritual. On this level,one cannot feel the spiritual, but knows that the body is intimately attached toit.In the Verses of Praise, a person becomes aware of the level of ruach, thedivine wind-spirit. This is the inner space where one is totally aware of one’sown spiritual nature and connection to God. This is also the level of speech. Justas speech traverses distance, so does wind. When you say the words of thissection, try to feel the divine “wind” blowing through your being.It is no accident that the word ruach means both “wind” and “spirit.” We livein a sea of air that is so familiar to us that we remain totally oblivious to it.Similarly, we are oblivious to the sea of spirituality that surrounds us at alltimes. Nevertheless, when the air displays energy and moves, we feel it as awind (ruach); when the spiritual displays energy and moves, we have anexperience of spirit (ruach). The second section of the service is meant to elicitthis experience.In the third part of the service, which consists of the Shema and its blessings,we reach up to the World of Love and the realm of unity. Here, one is aware ofneshamah, the Breath of God. There is a vast diʃerence between the inner spacefeeling of ruach and that of neshamah. It is the diʃerence between feeling a windand a breath. A wind has energy and force, but it is impersonal. A breath is bothpersonal and intimate. Feeling the breath of one’s beloved is a most sensualexperience."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Therefore, in the third section of the service, a person has a neshamahexperience, in which he feels an intimacy with God, as if God were breathing onhim, as it were. This is the level of divine love and unity.After the Shema, one again recounts the story of the Exodus and repeatscertain key phrases from the Song at the Sea. This is also a transition, but to anew, even more expanded level of consciousness that will lead to the Amidah.The third part of the service concludes with the blessing “Blessed are You,Adonoy, Redeemer of Israel.” The “Israel” in the worshiper is here “redeemed”and allowed to enter the inner reaches of the divine realm.This is attained in the fourth part of the service, the Amidah. Here, one entersinto a realm that transcends thought. In the Amidah, we do not think about thewords we are saying, but experience them. This does not mean that we are notaware of the words. Quite to the contrary: we are extremely aware, but on alevel that goes beyond thought and penetrates every ɹber of our being. It is as ifthe words are ɹlling our entire consciousness and their innermost meaning isbecoming one with the deepest reaches of our souls.This level parallels the yod of the Tetragrammaton. This is not the level of the“hand” or “mind” that holds the divine essence, but the essence itself. Therefore,on this level, one is intimately aware of the essence in each word.This level corresponds to a still higher level of the soul, even above neshamah.This fourth level of the soul is known as chayyah, which literally means “lifeforce.” If the level of neshamah involves an awareness of the breath of theDivine, then the level of chayyah is the awareness of the divine life force itself.The Zohar states that a kiss is the merging of one breath with another. Lovebegins with physical attraction. Then, as lovers begin communication, they beginto speak. As they get closer, they stop speaking and are merely aware of eachother’s breath. Finally, they come still closer, and their communication becomesa kiss, at which point they are actually in physical contact. At this moment, inthe kiss, they are aware of each other’s life force. Kissing is thus a naturalconsequence of increased intimacy in speech. The two mouths come closer andcloser and progress from speech, to breath, to the kiss. Thus, there are fourlevels in the intimacy of love: physical attraction, speech, breath, and the kiss.These same levels exist in the relationship of a person with the Divine.The service is designed to bring a person through these four levels. In theIntroductory Readings, one is attracted to God with one’s physical being. In theVerses of Praise, one communicates with the Divine in speech. In the Shema andits blessings, one experiences intimacy with the Divine on the level of breath.Finally, the Amidah is the kiss, and the level of communication is with the life"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"force itself. It is signiɹcant that the level of communication of the Amidah is lifeforce, since the Hebrew word for “life” is chai (), which has a numerical valueof eighteen (8 + 10). Eighteen is also the basic number of blessings in theAmidah.After the Amidah, there is a ɹfth section of the service, which is known as the“Descent of Inɻux” (yeridath ha-shefa). Here one strives to bring the spirituallevels that one has attained during the service into one’s life. It is not enough tohave the experience; one must also be able to hold on to it and keep it for theentire day.We thus see that the daily service is much more than a mere “order ofprayer.” It is, in fact, a spiritual pilgrimage in which one rises from one level ofspirituality to the next, gaining ever-increasing intimacy with the Divine. It is adaily meditation experience that can have the most profound spiritual eʃects ona person."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"15IN ALL YOUR WAYSOne of the key teachings of Judaism is that one can experience a closeness toGod in anything one does. The Talmud bases this teaching on the verse “In allyour ways know him” (Prov. 3:6) and says that this short verse “contains theentire essence of the Torah.” It teaches that no matter what a person does, hecan dedicate it to God and make it into an act of worship. Even the mostmundane act can serve as a link to the Divine.Take a routine task, something that has to be done, like washing the dishes. Itcan be pure drudgery; however, if one elevates it to an act of worship, it can bean exalting experience through which one draws close to God. It all depends onone’s intentions.When washing dishes, one can think about the fact that the dishes will beclean for the next meal. The meal will be eaten so that the family will have thestrength to go through another day, and perhaps gain a new and deeperawareness of God. People will recite blessings over food, making the act ofeating into a sacrament. Thus, the washing of dishes, at least indirectly, can beseen as a means through which one will draw close to God in other ways.The act itself can also be an elevating experience. Imagine that you are aboutto prepare a meal for the person you love more than anyone else in the world.Imagine that it is not just an ordinary meal, but one to celebrate an importantmilestone in your lives. All the love that you feel for this person is going intothe preparation of this meal. It is to be a special meal, with everything justperfect.Now imagine that you are washing the dishes that are going to be used for thismeal. You would want every dish to be perfectly clean and shiny, without theslightest speck or spot. The act of washing dishes would then also be an act oflove.Think for a moment of the greatest love you ever had in your life. If you haveever been deeply in love, you know that there is a stage where the mindbecomes almost obsessed with the one you love. No matter what you are doing"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"—eating, sleeping, working—the person you love hovers at the edge of yourconsciousness. Everything else is unimportant—it is as if you are just markingtime until you can see or speak to this person again. All other pleasures in theworld are secondary to the pleasure of being in this person’s presence.It is possible to love God in this manner, and with even greater intensity.There is a level of love at which one constantly yearns and longs for a closenessto God. No matter what pleasures one enjoys, they are nothing compared withthis feeling of closeness. True love for God can surpass even the greatest passionthat can exist between man and woman.When a person has such a love for God, then even an act as mundane aswashing dishes becomes an expression of this love. Then, the more oneconcentrates on the act of washing a dish, the greater and more intense this lovebecomes. The act itself becomes an expression of love.The more aware we become of God’s love for us, the more open we becometo loving God. If we concentrate on what we are doing, even an act as lowly aswashing a dish can connect us to God. We may say to ourselves: Now I amwashing a dish because I will be sharing a meal with God, and I love God morethan anything else in the world.Even a mundane act can thus become a vehicle to connect God’s love for us toour love for Him. It is as if God’s love is on one side, our love is on the other,and the act is in the middle.This is reminiscent of our discussion of the Shema (see chapter 13). As notedthere, the prayer right before the Shema ends with a statement of God’s love forIsrael; after the Shema, we say, “You shall love God, your Lord, with all yourheart....” We saw how the Shema, as the expression of God’s unity, bridgedthese two loves. Therefore, when a person wishes to make an action representthe connection between the two loves, the action itself must be an expression ofGod’s unity. This can be understood in the following manner:If God is One, then He and His will must also be One. Since God is absolutelyOne, then He must be identical with His will.On the other hand, things exist only because God wills them to exist. If Goddid not will an object to exist, it would simply stop existing. God gave eachthing existence through His will, and it is only through His will that it cancontinue to exist.This implies that God’s will is in everything. However, if God is identical withHis will, then God must also be in everything. Therefore, every action and everything must be permeated with God’s essence.Now imagine that you are washing the dishes. You are concentrating on the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"act of washing, clearing the mind of all other thoughts. Any other thought thatenters the mind is gently pushed aside, so that the task at hand totally ɹlls themind. You are totally aware of the act you are doing, and as far as you areconcerned, nothing else exists in the universe.Concentrate for a moment on a dish and realize that it is an expression ofGod’s will and essence. Although it may be hidden, there is a spark of the Divinein the dish. There is also a spark of the Divine in the water with which you arewashing the dish. When a person develops such an awareness, then even themost mundane act can become an intimate experience of the Divine.This concept is manifestly more explicit in Jewish teachings regarding eating.It is taught that when a person eats, he should concentrate totally on the foodand the experience of eating it, clearing the mind of all other thoughts. Heshould have in mind that the taste of the food is also an expression of the Divinein the food, and that by eating it, he is incorporating this spark of the Divineinto his body. A person can also have in mind that he will dedicate the energythat he will obtain from this food to God’s service. It is taught that when aperson does this, it is counted as if the food he is eating is a sacriɹce on theGreat Altar in Jerusalem.Therefore, eating itself can be a form of meditation as well as a meansthrough which one can draw closer to God. It is for this reason that it wasordained that a blessing be recited before one begins eating. The blessing varieswith each food, and a complete list can be found in most standard prayer books.Each general category of food has its own blessing. Thus, for example, theblessing over food that grows on a tree is:Barukh Attah Adonoy, Elohenu Melekh ha-Olam, Borey peri ha-etz.Blessed are You, O God, our Lord, King of the Universe, Who creates the fruit of the tree.The ɹrst thing that one notices is that the blessing is in the present tenserather than in the past. The wording is, “Who creates the fruit,” and not, “Whocreated.” The blessing therefore immediately indicates that God’s creative poweris in the fruit right now, at the instant one is eating it. As soon as one has thisawareness, the act of eating becomes an act of communing with the Divine.I have already discussed the signiɹcance of the word “blessed” as it applies toGod. Therefore, when we open the blessing with the words “Blessed areYou ...,”we are expressing our realization that God is immanent in all creation.When the blessing is said with deep concentration, as in the Amidah, the wordsthemselves make us aware of this immanence.Right after that, we refer to God as “our Lord” (Elohenu). As discussed before,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"this indicates that He makes Himself available to us and allows us to experienceHim. It is because of God’s immanence that He is accessible to us, and we canexperience His closeness whenever we make a sincere attempt to do so.Too much emphasis on God’s immanence, however, might lead a person tominimize His greatness. One might even get too familiar with the Divine.Therefore, the very next expression in the blessing is “King of the Universe.” Wemake ourselves aware that this Presence that we are addressing is the sameInɹnite Being that rules all creation, the same Presence that exists throughoutthe entire universe, in stars and galaxies beyond comprehension.When we say that God is “King of the Universe,” we avoid falling into theintellectual trap of pantheism. We are aware that God’s presence permeates allthings, but we realize that this does not mean that God is no more than the sumof all things. We therefore say that God is King of the Universe. A king’s powermay ɹll his entire kingdom, but this does not mean that the king and hiskingdom are one and the same. Although God’s essence permeates all creation,God Himself is infinitely higher than anything and everything He created.We then conclude the blessing in the appropriate manner. In our example, theconclusion is, “Who creates the fruit of the tree.” Other endings are, “Whocreates the fruit of the ground,” for most vegetables; “Who created the fruit ofthe vine,” for wine; “Who brings forth bread from the earth,” for bread; “Whocreates various nourishing foods,” for grain products; and “by Whose word allthings exist,” for any food not in one of the above categories. We designate thefood and make ourselves aware of God’s creative power and immanence in thefood we eat.The blessing should be said very slowly, with the mind cleared of allextraneous thought. When said in such a manner, the blessing before food can bea very powerful meditation.People sometimes ask why Judaism does not have an eating discipline likemany of the Eastern religions. Of course, Judaism does have one importanteating discipline, namely keeping kosher. An animal must be slaughtered in avery speciɹc manner before it can be eaten, and all the blood must be drainedout completely. Certain species are absolutely forbidden.The most important discipline of Judaism, however, involves the blessing.When a blessing is recited before eating, then the act itself becomes a spiritualundertaking. Through the blessing, the act of eating becomes a contemplativeexercise. Just as one can contemplate a ɻower or a melody, one cancontemplate the act of eating. One opens one’s mind completely to theexperience of masticating the food and ɹlls the awareness with the taste and"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"texture of the food. One then eats very slowly, aware of every nuance of taste.When one eats with the proper state of consciousness, one can make do with amuch smaller amount of food. The body’s own wisdom determines how muchfood is required, and no more is desired, since one does not eat out ofcompulsion or out of nervous habit. Therefore, one eats exactly as much as onerequires, no more and no less.In general, then, Judaism sees even the most mundane acts as means ofgaining God consciousness. Working, eating, dressing, all can be made into actsof worship. A person who does this can begin to see God in every facet of life."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"16THE COMMANDMENTSIn the previous chapter, I discussed how even mundane acts can be made intoan act of worship through which one can experience the Divine. There are otheractions, however, that are speciɹcally designed to bring a person closer to God.These include the many commandments and rituals of Judaism.It is taught that the Torah contains a total of 613 commandments. The idea ofkeeping 613 commandments may seem overwhelming. Indeed, one must be ascholar to even be able to ɹnd all 613 commandments in the Torah. However,there are a number of published lists of the commandments, and a study of theselists will show that most of the commandments pertain only to special cases,special people, or special places. Thus, for example, a large number of thecommandments deal with the service in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, whichno longer exists, and even when it did exist, many of the rituals were theresponsibility only of the kohen priests. Other commandments involveagriculture or criminal law and have little bearing on the day-to-day practice ofJudaism.Therefore, if one studies the commandments, it turns out that, for the mostpart, the practice of Judaism is deɹned by three or four dozen of them. Thesecommandments deɹne the structure of Judaism, and keeping them is whatmakes a person an observant Jew.Besides the commandments found in the Torah itself, there are numerousrituals and customs that have become an integral part of Judaism. A number ofthese were legislated by the ancient sages because they saw that an additionalspiritual aid or dimension was needed by the Jewish people. The additionalrituals provided this dimension and allowed the person to have a full spirituallife, even where it was impossible to keep all the commandments.Thus, for example, the Torah prescribes that all Jewish holidays be observedfor one day. Later, when there was trouble ɹxing the calendar, it was legislatedthat festivals be kept for two days outside the Holy Land. On the surface, thereason was that there was a question as to which day the festival fell on. The"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Zohar, however, states that outside the Holy Land, it was impossible toaccomplish spiritually in one day what must be accomplished on a festival.Therefore, a second day was added so that one would be able to complete thespiritual growth implied by the festival.The same, to a large degree, is true of customs. The Talmud states that whenthe Jewish people adopt a custom, they are doing so on the basis of what is veryclose to prophetic inspiration. Witnessing the establishment of a custom, Hillel(first century B.C.E.) remarked, “Let the Israelites follow their own course. If theyare not prophets, then they are apprentice prophets.” This suggests that peoplehave the power, collectively, to feel a spiritual need and ɹll it. Therefore, evencustoms can contain a powerful degree of spiritual energy.It was also decreed that before performing many commandments and rituals,a blessing must be said. As discussed earlier, every blessing is a statement ofGod’s immanence. However, since a commandment comes from God, it is alsoan expression of His will. As we have discussed earlier, God is identical with Hiswill (at least on one level of understanding), and therefore God is uniquelypresent in His commandments. When a person performs a ritual mandated by acommandment, he or she has the opportunity to create a unique bond with God.All the blessings said over commandments have a common beginning:Barukh Attah Adonoy, Elohenu Melekh ha-Olam asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav, ve-tzivanu ...Blessed are You, O God, our Lord, King of the Universe, Who sanctiɹed us with His precepts, and commandedus....In the blessing, we state that God “sanctiɹed us with His commandments.” Inthis statement, we recognize the commandments as a means through which Godsanctiɹes our lives and raises us above the mundane. We see that thecommandments are a special means that God gave us to experience the Divine.When keeping any ritual, we should see it as an expression of our desire to beclose to God. Here again, love provides a pertinent example.Imagine that you are in love. You are constantly trying to do things to pleaseyour beloved and draw closer to him or her. If the beloved makes a request, youmay see it as a unique opportunity to express your love. There is no greaterpleasure than doing something like that; the very fact that you are doingsomething that your beloved desires makes it a total act of love.The same is true of God’s commandments. These are not acts that one does onone’s own to express one’s love for God, but acts that God has asked us to do asan expression of this love. If one keeps God in mind when observing acommandment, the experience can be one of overwhelming love for and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"closeness to the Divine.Furthermore, since these are God’s commandments, they are closely anduniquely linked to God’s will. This expression of the divine will is every bit asreal as the will through which God created the universe. Therefore, acommandment is every bit as real as a physical object. If one meditates on this,one can see the observance as something real and palpable, ɹlled with theDivine.When you keep a commandment, try meditating on the fact that God’s will isin the commandment. In a deep meditative State, you will actually be able tofeel God’s will in the action and the fact that God and His will are One.Besides the blessing said before a commandment, there is another meditationthat is recommended by the great Jewish mystics. It says:I am doing this for the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be He and His Divine Presence,with awe and love, in the name of all Israel.The term “Holy One, Blessed be He” (Kuclesha berikh Hu) is a commonAramaic term used to denote God, found in both the Talmud and the Zohar. Tounderstand the meaning of this meditation, we must understand why thisparticular term is used.I have explained that the word “blessed” when applied to God refers to Hisimmanence. However, we must also understand what the word “holy” meanswhen applied to God. Usually, when we say that something is holy, we meanthat it is close to God or pertains to His worship. But what does the word meanwhen applied to God Himself?When we use the word “holy” to describe a person or object, we areindicating not only that it is dedicated to God, but also that it is both separatedand distinguished from the mundane. Therefore, when we say that God is“holy,” we are saying that He is separated from the mundane to the greatestextent imaginable. Therefore, when we say that God is “holy,” we are sayingthat He is utterly transcendent.In Judaism, there is always a tension between God’s immanence and Histranscendence. When we say that God is “blessed” we recognize that He is holy,while when we say that He is “holy” we are aware that He is transcendent. Godis, as it were, both very near and very far. The Kabbalists express it by sayingthat God both ɹlls all creation and surrounds all creation. On the other hand, Heis immanent and ɹlls all creation; “no place is devoid of Him.” On the otherhand, He surrounds all creation and is totally Other than it."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"When we speak of God as “the Holy One, blessed be He,” we are saying thatHe is “the transcendent One, Who is immanent.” We are declaring that God isutterly transcendent, but that we can also experience Him as being immanent.The term “Holy One, blessed be He” therefore bridges the gap between God’stranscendence and His immanence. It is as if God was very far away but wasstretching out His hand to enable us to grasp it. This is represented by the vav ()of the Tetragrammaton, as I have discussed earlier. Indeed, the Kabbalistsexplicitly state that the expression “Holy One, blessed be He” denotes the Divineon the level of this vav.Furthermore, the Zohar states that “the Holy One, blessed be He, and theTorah are One.” This is because the Torah is the means through which Godreaches out to us from His transcendence. Indeed, the Torah usesanthropomorphisms to describe God primarily to make Him moreunderstandable and “human” to us and allow us to experience His immanence.The commandments in the Torah also serve as a link between God and humanbeings.The Kabbalistic meditation uniɹes “the Holy One, blessed be He, with HisDivine Presence.” The Hebrew word for the Divine Presence is Shekhinah, whichliterally means “that which dwells.” The Shekhinah is a very important conceptin Judaism in general.The Shekhinah is said to be wherever God’s presence is manifest. Thus, it istaught that the Shekhinah was on Mount Sinai when God gave thecommandments and later in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Furthermore, whenan individual experienced prophecy, it was said that the Shekhinah rested onhim. Since the word Shekhinah comes from the root shakhan, meaning “todwell,” Shekhinah denotes that God appears to be “dwelling” in a certain place.But what does it mean when we say that God “dwells” in a place? It cannot betaken literally, since God’s essence ɹlls all creation. When we say that God“dwells” in a certain place, we really mean that people can have an additionalawareness of God there. Wherever the Shekhinah rests, there is an enhancedability to experience the Divine.When God allows His Shekhinah to rest in a certain place or situation, it is as ifHe were giving us a hand with which to receive the experience of the Divine.This is represented by the last heh () of the Tetragrammaton. Here again, theKabbalists teach that the Shekhinah represents the same level of the Divine asthis final heh.Therefore, when this meditation speaks of uniting “the Holy One, blessed beHe, and His Shekhinah,” it is speaking of uniting the levels of the vav and the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"heh: the arm reaching out to us, and the hand that God gives us so that we mayreceive. Indeed, some versions of this meditation state explicitly that the vavand the heh are being united. Observing a commandment allows us to unite themale and female aspects of God’s presence in the world.This is the essential purpose of keeping a commandment. God is alwaysstretching out His arm to us, willing to give of His essence and spirituality.Before we can take it from Him, we must have a vessel with which to hold it, a“hand” with which to receive. The way we do this is by making ourselvesreceptacles for the Divine. God gives us the hand with which to receive theDivine, but we must bring it together with the outstretched arm. The goal of thecommandments is to unite the vav and the heh.When we say the above meditation, we should bear in mind that we arereceptacles for the Divine. Try to feel the great hollow inside yourself that canbe ɹlled only by God’s essence, and more than anything in the world, yearn thatthis hollow be filled.At the same time, we should also be aware of God’s presence all around us.We should contemplate the fact that God always wants to make Himselfavailable, but needs an act on our part. The commandments serve as thismedium, and through them God’s essence is brought into our being. Therefore,when performing any commandment or ritual, we should be aware that we aredrawing into ourselves the light of the Divine.The meditation goes on to say that the commandment is being done with“love and awe.” As we have seen, keeping a commandment can be a powerfulexpression of love. Love is the feeling that one wishes to unite with the Divine.There must be a boundary on this love, or one can become swallowed up by itcompletely. Therefore, love for the Divine must be balanced by awe. Lovedraws us closer to God, but awe keeps us from getting too close.When we learn to look at the rituals and commandments in this light, all ofJudaism takes on new signiɹcance. We can see the commandments as the paththat God Himself gave for us to come close to Him and experience His presence."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"17BETWEEN MAN AND WOMANIn earlier chapters, I discussed how the last two letters of the Tetragrammaton,vav () and heh (), represent the male and female forces of providence. Themale force is that which acts upon the world, while the female force is thatwhich allows the world to be receptive to God’s power.This is one reason that we refer to God in the male gender when we pray. Ofcourse, although we usually refer to God as a male, in His true essence He iswithout gender. We refer to Him as a male, however, because we want Him toact upon the world through the male force of providence. We then leaveourselves open to God’s providence, as a female is open to her mate.The expression “the Holy One, blessed be He” is in the male gender and istherefore seen as denoting the male force of providence. It also relates to thevav of the Tetragrammaton.The Hebrew word for “Divine Presence,” on the other hand, is Shekhinah,which is a feminine noun. The Shekhinah denotes the ɹnal heh in the divinename as well as the female power of providence.It is signiɹcant that the Torah presents man and woman together ascomprising the image of the Divine. The Torah thus says, “God created man inHis image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He createdthem” (Gen. 1:27). This clearly implies that male and female together form the“image of God.”The reason for this is obvious. A male and female have the power to do themost Godlike thing possible, namely, to create life. The power to conceive achild is so Godlike that the Talmud states that when man and woman create achild, God Himself is their third partner.Therefore, a husband and wife should see each other as being a reɻection ofthe Divine. When a woman looks at her husband, she should see him as areɻection of “the Holy One, blessed be He,” the male aspect of the Divine.Similarly, when a husband looks at his wife, he should see her as the DivinePresence (Shekhinah), the feminine aspect of the Divine."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"When a person attains this goal, he will fully appreciate his wife’s beauty andsee it as a reɻection of the Divine. He will then also be aware of her innerbeauty, which is a reɻection of the beauty of the Shekhinah. When one cancontemplate this, one is ɹlled with a love toward one’s spouse that parallels thesupernal love between the masculine and feminine forces of the Divine.The Torah tells about the love between Jacob and Rachel, and describes it asone of the greatest loves the world has ever seen. It tells how Jacob was willingto work as an indentured servant for seven years to win Rachel’s hand, and howthe seven years “passed like days, so much did he love her” (Gen. 29:20). TheJewish mystics explain that Jacob saw himself as the male aspect of the Divineand Rachel as the female aspect; he therefore had a love that was a counterpartof the love on high.When one is looking for a spiritual master, the ɹrst thing to examine is themaster’s relationship with his wife. From the way a man treats his wife, one canknow how he relates to the Shekhinah. No matter how deep the master’smeditations seem to be, no matter how wise his words, if he does not have agood relationship with his wife, then there is something missing from hisspirituality. Conversely, when a man has a good relationship with his wife, evenin the face of temptation and adversity, it is a clear indication that he is on ahigh spiritual level.I once knew a member of the Musar school of meditation who was married toa woman with a severe mental illness. But whereas she was ɹlled with angerand abuse, he responded with love and devotion. No matter how mean she wasto him, he constantly saw her as his link with the Divine, and gave love andrespect accordingly. It would be nice to say that this love cured her, but inactuality it did not. However, when he was left a widower as an old man, thisman would constantly say how much he appreciated and missed his wife.It is also signiɹcant that there is no encouragement of celibacy in the Jewishtradition, mystical or otherwise. Moses, the greatest of all mystics and prophets,was married, as were all the prophets and sages. Sex is seen not as a weaknessof the ɻesh or as a necessary evil, but as a means to drawing close to God on amost intimate level.When man and wife see each other as personiɹcations of the divine image,then the sexual act becomes something holy. It is nothing less than the comingtogether of the male and female forces of creation. On a physical level, this hasthe power to create a child, but these forces parallel those on high whichbrought all creation into existence.The male and female forces of creation are represented by the yod () and the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"heh () of the Tetragrammaton. This is very closely related to a fascinatingTalmudic teaching: The Hebrew word for man is iysh (), while the word forwoman is ishah (). If one looks at the words, one sees that the word iyshcontains a yod (), while ishah contains a heh(). The Talmud says that these arethe yod and heh of the Tetragrammaton.If the yod and heh are removed from iysh and ishah, then the remaining lettersof both words spell out esh (), the Hebrew word for “ɹre.” The ɹres ofpassion that unite man and woman are seen as receptacles for the letters of theDivine Name, and hence, for the masculine and feminine elements of the DivineEssence. The passion that draws man and woman together stems from the factthat man and woman are counterparts of the male and female archetypes onhigh.Therefore, when husband and wife are intimate, a man can see himself asbeing ɹlled with the male aspect of the Divine, making an intimate connectionwith the female aspect. Similarly, a woman can see herself as the female aspect,receiving the male aspect. They can both realize that through their union, theyare creating an “image of God.”For this to be accomplished, it is very important to avoid any extraneousthoughts during the sexual act. Partners should not think of any member of theopposite sex other than the sexual partner of the moment. As in any meditationinvolving action, concentration should be totally on the act itself, with allextraneous thoughts gently pushed aside.There are several guidelines that are found in the Talmud and Kabbalah toenhance the meditative aspects of the act. First, the experience is meant to beprimarily tactile, involving the sense of touch. Therefore, it should be performedin a room as dark as possible. Each party should have nothing distracting him orher from the experience.It is also taught that there should be no clothing intervening between the twobodies. The Torah speaks of man and woman becoming “one ɻesh” (Gen. 2:24).This indicates that ɻesh should be in direct contact with ɻesh, so that the tactileexperience is maximized.The Kabbalah teaches that the sexual act should begin with words ofendearment and then progress to kissing, hugging, and caressing, and ɹnally tototal intimacy. It is as if the process begins with the head and mind in speechand kissing. It then is drawn down to the hands and body in hugging andcaressing. Finally, it is drawn to the reproductive organs, which are the seat ofthe greatest sexual pleasure. The sexual energy can be felt traveling down thespine and through the body, leading to the most sensitive areas."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"God created the sexual act as one of the greatest pleasures that a human beingcan experience. For one thing, the act had to be pleasurable so that humanbeings would be drawn to it and thus perpetuate the species. But on a muchdeeper level, it is so great a pleasure because it allows man and woman togetherto emulate the Divine.When a man and woman experience pleasure from each other, they cancontemplate this pleasure as a meditative experience. This will have theimmediate eʃect of enhancing the pleasure manyfold. If they see this pleasureas a gift of God, they will have great joy from it and, at the same time,experience a feeling of thanksgiving. On a deeper level, they can be aware ofthe spark of the Divine in the pleasure itself and elevate it to its source.If a couple has such intentions, then the sexual act can be something holy. TheTorah says that a married man may not “diminish his wife’s conjugal rights”(Exod. 21:10). The Talmud interprets this to mean that it is one of the divinecommandments that a husband and wife be intimate at regular intervals.Therefore, when being intimate, a husband and wife can also meditate on thefact that they are fulɹlling one of God’s commandments. Sex is not simply amundane act that is being elevated, but a sacred act in its own right.Very important in making sex a holy act is keeping the rules of family purity.This involves the woman’s counting seven days after the end of her period andthen immersing in a mikveh (ritual bath). The monthly menses are seen as acleansing process, and immersion in the mikveh as a process of rebirth. (Thephilosophy of the mikveh is discussed at length in my book The Waters of Eden.)In many ways, immersion in the mikveh is more important to making sex a holyact than even marriage itself.In general, using meditative techniques during intimacy can enhance thepleasure immeasurably. Such a practice focuses the minds of both partnersexclusively on their mates and thus serves to strengthen the marriage bond.Couples who regularly use meditative techniques during intimacy haveexperienced important gains in their feelings toward each other. Couples whowere experiencing marital diɽculties found that when their sex life wassanctiɹed, their love grew and other problems seemed to becomeinconsequential.The type of meditation that a couple can do when they wish to conceive achild is somewhat diʃerent. This is because if they are on a certain level ofconsciousness, the thoughts that they have during intimacy can have a strongeffect on the child conceived.The Torah teaches that when Jacob wanted his sheep to conceive spotted,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"banded, or striped oʃspring, he cut rods with the appropriate markings, and setthem out where the sheep mated (Gen. 30:37,38). It is taught that Jacobmeditated on these rods, and when he was in a very high level of consciousness,he was able to project his thoughts on the the sheep being conceived and thusinɻuence their markings. Deep meditation can have an eʃect on the geneticstructure of one’s offspring, as well as the child’s spiritual makeup.Therefore, when a couple wish to conceive, they should decide what traitsthey would consider most desirable in the child. They should agree on what theyconsider most important, and what they would most want their child to be.Then, using visualization techniques discussed in chapter 8, they should bothvisualize the child they want to conceive during intercourse. If this is done withtotal concentration, it can have a positive inɻuence on the conceived child.While it is not a foolproof technique, especially if the members of the couple arenot expert meditators, experience has shown it to have signiɹcant inɻuence.Experience has also shown that couples who have diɽculty in conceiving oftenhave success when using such an imaging technique.For many people, sex is associated with guilt and shame. But if we understandthat God gave us sexual pleasure as a gift, we will realize that we can enjoy it tothe fullest.Of course, sex is also an area of great temptation. A person may havecommitted sexual acts, such as adultery, which are regarded as sinful. Here, too,one must realize that sins can be repented; as the Talmud states, “Nothing canstand before repentance.” Even if one has fallen into temptation, one can ask,with all one’s heart, for God’s forgiveness. The fact that a person may havesinned or done wrong need not diminish or destroy his or her ability toexperience the Divine.Judaism views the sexual act as something very holy. It is a means throughwhich a person can experience great intimacy with God. Judaism surrounds thesexual act with many rules and prohibitions, not because it views sex assomething dirty or shameful, but because it views sex as something so holy thatit must not be misused. Used correctly, with the right intentions and thoughts,sex can be the purest and holiest experience in the world, and meditation canenhance this aspect of the experience."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"18REMOLDING THE SELFOne of the most important meditative movements in Judaism is associated withthe Musar school, founded by Rabbi Yisrael Salanter (1810–1883). Musar, self-perfection, was always an important element in Judaism; important texts on thesubject were published as early as the tenth century. The Musar movement,however, made self-perfection its primary focus. The movement taught that aperson should continually strive to grow spiritually, ethically, and morallythroughout the course of his lifetime.Interpersonal relationships were given a high priority in the Musar movement.It was not enough to be able to experience the Divine; one also had to be able toget along with others in the best possible manner. Anger, hatred, revenge,gossip, and jealousy were seen as bad habits that could stunt a person’s spiritualgrowth. The premise was that if we grow in our relationship to God, we shouldalso grow in our ability to relate in a positive way to our fellow human beings.The Musar school thus strove to make every individual into a saint in everysense of the word. People were taught to be sensitive to their own shortcomingsand were encouraged to create personal programs to rectify them one by one.To some extent, the Musar movement was a reaction to the Chasidicmovement. Chasidism began as a mystical movement. In order to climb highspiritual mountains, experienced guides, o r rebbes, were needed. In someChasidic circles, however, the guide became more important than the mountain.Many Chasidim regarded their rebbe as the paradigm of the saintly man andlived the righteous life vicariously through him.The Musar movement developed among the Mitnaggedim, opponents of theChasidic movement. Musar schools taught that it was not enough to live therighteous life through a master. Every individual had an obligation to strive tolive the righteous life in his own right. Beyond that, the Musar movementoffered a program through which every person could gradually perfect himself.There is an extensive Musar literature in Hebrew. Some of the most importantMusar works, such as Path of the Upright (Mesillath Yesharim), by Moses Hayim"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Luzzatto, and Ways of the Righteous (Orchoth Tzaddikim), anon., have beentranslated into English.The ɹrst part of the Musar program was to make a daily habit of reading alesson from a classical Musar work. After reading the lesson, one was to spend ashort period of time contemplating it and relating it to one’s own life.As the individual began to advance, this contemplation became a meditation.One would read a lesson from a classical Musar text on how to improve theethical, moral, and religious quality of one’s life, then meditate on this lessonfor twenty to thirty minutes. This is a simple type of meditation, similar to theone described in chapter 3, where I discussed meditating on how to rearrangeyour life. It is a meditation in which one considers a particular aspect of one’slife and thinks about ways to improve it.In meditations such as these, extraneous thoughts are gently pushed out of themind. Some authorities, such as the Baal Shem Tov, however, maintained that aperson should pay attention to extraneous thoughts, since they could provideclues as to what direction to take. One may wish to make mental notes of theseextraneous thoughts and then analyze them to see how to make use of them tohelp attain one’s goals.The program of self-improvement could include more than just moral issues.The Musar schools saw their method as a way of becoming a more eʃectivehuman being. Problems such as shyness, indecision, lack of motivation, and thelike could also be helped through Musar methods.The second part of the Musar program consists of a mantralike repetition ofthe concept one is working on. For example, a person may have a tendency togossip and want to break this habit. He may realize that gossip is harmful toothers and morally wrong, and that it is forbidden by the Torah commandment“Do not go as a talebearer among your people” (Lev. 19:16).The method of breaking the gossip habit would be to take the biblical verse“Do not go as a talebearer among your people” and repeat it every day for atwenty- to thirty-minute period, like a mantra. As one works on it, the messageis gradually absorbed, and the self-control necessary to avoid gossip is attained.Another eʃective technique is described by Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. Thistechnique consists in speaking to various parts of the body. If a person wishes tochange a certain trait, he can talk to the part of the body associated with thattrait, and in this way change his actions.Taking the above example of gossip, a person could use Rabbi Nachman’stechnique and speak to his tongue, telling it never to say anything againstanother person. If one does this for a ɹxed amount of time every day, this, too,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"can be an effective form of meditation.Let us say that you want to lose weight. You can use Musar and othermeditative techniques in various ways. You can simply use the phrase “I amgoing to lose weight” as a mantra. You can speak to your body and tell it thatyou want it to be slim. You can also use an imaging technique: imagine yourselfslim, what you would look like, and how it would feel to be carrying lessweight. Gradually your self-image will start to change. You can speak to yourmouth, telling it not to eat so much, and to your stomach, telling it to crave lessfood. A combination of techniques can be eʃective even in overcoming lifelonghabits.There are several hints that the Musar schools give to make any self-improvement program more eʃective. The ɹrst is not to try to make too manychanges at once. A Talmudic teaching—“If one tries to grasp too much, onegrasps nothing”—is taken as a watchword. Better to be successful in makingsmall changes than to fail at making big ones. If one succeeds in making a smallchange in one’s life, it is easy to build on this success.The important message is that success breeds success and failure breedsfailure. People often try to eʃect a change in their life-style and make theattempt many times, only to meet with failure. This is particularly true ofpeople who have tried to lose weight or give up smoking.Take as an example the person who resolves to quit smoking. He keeps hisresolution for a few weeks, but then feels that he cannot go for the rest of hislife without a cigarette and reverts back to his bad habit. He has experienced afailure, which makes stopping all the more diɽcult the next time around. Aftera number of such failures, people give up and feel that the habit in question isbeyond their control.The Musar approach would be to give up smoking for a speciɹed period oftime, say thirty days. At the end of the thirty-day period, one could beginsmoking again. This is the key to success. During this thirty-day period, a personwould not have to confront the fact that he will never taste a cigarette again orthat he will have to maintain this level of self-control for years to come. Thetime of abstinence is manageable because it has a limit.The point of this technique is that at the end of the thirty-day period, a personis free to choose whether or not to begin smoking again. If he resumes smoking,he does not have to feel like a failure. Quite to the contrary: he has beensuccessful in maintaining his thirty-day abstinence and therefore has a successupon which to build. Later, he can stop for another thirty-day period. Afterdoing this a number of times, he may find that the desire to smoke has waned."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Of course, at the end of any of these thirty-day periods, he may decide not toresume smoking. If one thirty-day period was a success, the second thirty-dayperiod will be even easier. By taking one thirty-day period after another, aperson can continually weaken the habit until it ceases to exist.This is particularly true if, during the period of abstinence, one uses the Musarmeditational techniques discussed earlier. One can use the expression “I want tostop smoking” as a mantra to help strengthen one’s will, so that by the end ofthe thirty-day period, the desire to smoke will be diminished. Othermeditational techniques can also be helpful.The idea of using thirty-day periods is a very powerful tool in spiritualgrowth. Many moral or ethical habits are easier to break than smoking or eatinghabits, since in the latter one must deal with the body as well as the mind. Manybad moral or ethical habits can be overcome in a thirty-day period.You can work on a relatively large number of character traits over the courseof years and thus continually grow, both spiritually and morally. You can in factremold yourself into the good and righteous person you wish to be. Where youare is not as important as where you are heading. If you are willing to devoteyour life to continued growth, there are virtually no limits to the levels you canreach."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"OTHER SCHOCKEN BOOKSOF RELATED INTERESTTHE MYSTIC QUESTAn Introduction to Jewish Mysticismby David S.
