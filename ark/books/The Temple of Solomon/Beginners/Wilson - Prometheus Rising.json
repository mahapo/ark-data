It actuallybegan as a Ph.D. dissertation called \"The Evolution of Neuro-Sociological Circuits: A Contribution to the Sociobiology ofConsciousness,\" which I wrote in 1978-79 for an alternativeuniversity called Paideia. At that time, Paideia ranked as StateApproved, the highest rating given to alternative universities inCalifornia, where we have alternatives to everything and thestate feels required to classify the alternatives on a scale of\"experimental\" to totally bonkers. Alas, Paideia, having achievedrelative respectability as an \"alternative,\" later joined with amuch more radical and Utopian outfit, Hawthorn University, andlost its top rank among counter-culture educational contraptionsin California, falling from Approved to Authorized, a muchlower rating. The whole megilla then joined into several flakeyoutfits loosely allied, none of which were recognized at all by thestate, which suited the new honchos perfectly, since they did notrecognize the state either.In Ireland in 1982, stuck with a dissertation which I liked a lotand a Ph.D. diploma which, due to the collapse of Paideia,looked less impressive, I decided to rewrite the manuscript inmore commercial form. The first change consisted of removingall the footnotes (about two of them per sentence) which gave theoriginal a truly academic stink but would annoy the average77"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12    Prometheus Risingreader. Then I expressed myself a little more bluntly (andperhaps snidely) in many places, adding much to the humor andnothing to the good taste. I also wrote a few more chapters,created all the exercizes, and sketched out diagrams for theillustrations.I then, with craft and cunning, removed most of the referencesto Dr. Timothy Leary from the early parts of the book and onlylet his name begin to appear frequently after about the middle. Ihad good reason, based on experience, to feel rather stronglythat, just as Dr. Tim was blacklisted by Establishment publishersat that time, any book openly and blatantly based largely on hisideas would also get thrown in the junk heap.I thought I now had a \"popular\" book, and maybe I almostdid. The first publisher to whom I submitted it, Jeremy Tarcher,held it for a full year of meditation before rejecting it; his onlyexplanation for the rejection concerned the mixture of technolo-gese and \"counter culture\" slang that has since become my mostfrequent style in nonfiction. (It's based on the way I actuallyspeak.) When I tried Falcon next, they accepted it within 48hours, and I received the advance check within the next 48 hours.\"Oh frabjous day!\"A month later, I heard from Tarcher again: he had changed hismind and decided he wanted the book after all. I was in one ofmy periods of acute poverty then (something that happens peri-odically to all freelance writers) and it was with great effort that Irefrained from telling Mr. Tarcher to go fuck himself. I just toldhim I had a contract with another publisher.With Falcon as publisher, I then inserted the acknowledg-ments page, giving Leary the credit he deserved right up front,and added a dedication to him. Falcon, as I expected, did notobject. Falcon has always served as an alternative to Establish-ment publishing, just as Paideia once served as a similar alterna-tive to the academic Establishment.Prometheus was one of Falcon's first books and, I think, thefirst done with computerized typesetting; as usual with suchpioneering efforts, it emerged with a phalanx of typos that haveembarrassed me considerably over the years. (When the SanFrancisco Chronicle first computerized they had similar prob-lems. I remember one story in which the Chief of Police,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    13denouncing drugs, rambled off into a sentence about the thrill ofmeeting Mickey Mouse and Goofy. I assume that line came fromanother story but it made the Chief sound as if he had gotten intosome weird chemicals himself.) In this edition, I have correctedthese errors, where I could find them; I know too much now tothink I found all of them. (Wilson's Tenth Law: no matter howmany times a writer proofs a book, hostile critics will alwaysfind at least one error that he missed.)I have also updated every place where I thought updatingseemed necessary. I even added a few new ideas (which, ofcourse, seem brilliant to me just because they are new) and somenew jokes and generally gave the text a badly-needed face-lift. Itis still one of my favorite books, and seems to rank high in theestimation of most of my fans.In Germany-Switzerland-Austria in the late 1980s, threeGerman versions existed simultaneously—a deluxe edition fromSphinx Verlag of Zurich, a mass-market paperback from RowaltVerlag of Hamburg, and an even cheaper pirate edition from thebusy troglodytes of the unterwelt. The last, of course, paid noroyalties but, by indicating that I had three audiences at threeeconomic levels, persuaded me feel like a very popular writer inMitteleuropa.As I contemplate this tenth printing of a \"far out\" or \"freakedout\" book that began its career back in 1978, I feel only mildlyembarrassed by the predictions that proved over-optimistic. (Ihave revised them, of course, in keeping with my current knowl-edge and best guesses). I feel much more astonished, andpleased, that many of the predictions now seem much less shock-ing than when I first published them. Indeed, the wildest andmost \"Utopian\" future-scans in here are precisely the ones thathave had the greatest scientific support in the 1990s. To see twodecades ahead, even in a few areas, counts as some sort of suc-cess in the Futurism game. And every bulletin from the embat-tled MIR space station reminds me that if my space forecastsprojected \"too much too soon,\" part of what I expected does infact already exist and the rest is obviously evolving.I feel more chagrined about my lyrical evocation of Intelli-gence Intensification. In the 1970s, I simply did not recognizethe extent to which the 1960s \"youth revolution\" had terrified"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14   Prometheus Risingour ruling Elite, or that they would try to prevent future upsurgesof radical Utopianism by deliberately \"dumbing down\" theeducational system. What they have produced, the so-calledGeneration X, must rank as not only the most ignorant but alsothe most paranoid and depressive kids ever to infest our Repub-lic. I agree with outlaw radio star Travis Hipp that the paranoiaand depression result inevitably from the ignorance. These kidsnot only don't know anything; they don't even want to know.1They only realize, vaguely, that somebody has screwed them outof something, but they don't have enough zest or bile to try tofind out who screwed them and what they were screwed out of.Fortunately, this Age of Stupidity cannot last very long.Already, most people know that if you want a good TV or VCR,you buy Japanese; for a good car, Japanese or German, etc.Eventually, in order to compete, the Elite will have to allow a bitmore education for American youth, before we sink fully to thelevel of a Third World nation.The other day I saw a film called The Edge, which I regardedas the best thing to come out of Hollywood since The Silence ofthe Lambs. Perhaps not coincidentally, this flic also starredAnthony Hopkins. In one scene, Hopkins and his co-star, AlecBaldwin, seem in an absolutely hopeless situation, lost in theArctic, stalked by a hungry bear, without weapons, seeminglydoomed. Baldwin collapses, and Hopkins has a magnificentmonologue, talking Baldwin out of his despair. The speech runs,roughly, like this: \"Did you know you can make fire out of ice?You can, you know. Fire out of ice. Think about it. Fire out ofice. Think. Think.\"This riddle has both a pragmatic and symbolic (alchemical)answer. The pragmatic answer you can find in the film, explic-itly; and it might prove useful if you ever get lost in the northwoods; and the alchemical, or Zen Buddhist, answer is also inthe film, implicitly, and only perceptible to those who understandOne of the spokespersons for Gen X, named Shann Nix, has a talkshow on KGO, one of the most powerful radio signals on the WestCoast.

Not many arethere who dare even to attempt such a task.Imagine anyone trying to make sense of an amalgam ofTimothy Leary's eight neurological circuits, Gurdjieff s self-observation exercises, Korzybski's general semantics, AleisterCrowley's magical theorems, the several disciplines of Yoga,Christian Science, relativity and modern quantum mechanics,and many other approaches to understanding the world aroundus! A man is required with an almost encyclopedic education, anincredibly flexible mind, insights as sharp as those whom he istrying synthesize and mirabile dictu, a wonderful sense ofhumor.For several years—ever since I first became familiar with thewritings of Robert Anton Wilson—I have been struck with hisever-present sense of bubbling humor and the wide scope of hisintellectual interests. Once I was even so presumptuous as towarn him in a letter that his humor was much too good to wasteon hoi polloi who generally speaking would not understand itand might even resent it. However this effervescent lightness ofheart became even more apparent in Cosmic Trigger and morelatterly in the trilogy of Schrodinger's Cat. I have sometimeswondered whether his extraordinarily wide range of intellectualroving is too extensive and therefore perplexing to the averagereader. Be that as it may, the humor and synthesis are even moremarked in this brilliant ambitious piece of writing, PrometheusRising."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"l8    Prometheus RisingEven if your reading has already made you familiar with someof the concepts employed by Wilson in this book, nonetheless hiselucidation even of the simplest, the most basic, is illuminating.At this moment, I am referring to the \"imprint\" theory which hemakes considerable use of. Much of the same is true of his refer-ences to and explanation of Leary's eight neurological circuits.We become familiar with them all over again, as if they had notbeen introduced to us before.Moreover I love the subtle and almost invisible use of mysti-cal dogma that permeates all his writings. For example, considerthe opening of Chapter Six. It quotes a particularly meaningfulsentence from William S. Burroughs. There is no mention—norneed there be—of any anterior teaching regarding this Law ofThree, as it may be called. But one doctrine that emanated from amedieval mystical school philosophizes that there are always twocontending forces—for the sake of convenience labeled Severityand Mildness—with a third that always reconciles them. It isparamount to this doctrine, which has been stated and statedagain in a dozen or more different ways throughout the centuries,culminating finally in the idea enunciated by Burroughs and ofcourse used by Wilson.There are dozens of similar seeds of wisdom sown throughoutPrometheus Rising that are bound to have a seminal effectwherever and whenever the book is read. This is one of the manyvirtues of Wilson's book; it will leave its mark on all those whoread it—and those seeds will surely take root and bloom in themost unlikely minds—as well as in the more prosaic. Tarotadvocates will find the most unusual and illuminatinginterpretations of some of their favorite cards when he falls backon the basic neural circuits. I found them all illuminating asproviding a new viewpoint which had to be integrated into mygeneral view of such matters.The only area where I was reluctantly inclined to be at oddswith Wilson was in what I considered to be his addiction to aUtopia—which he eloquently enough expresses as \"the birthpangs of a cosmic Prometheus rising out of the long nightmare ofdomesticated primate history.\" The history of mankind is alsothe history of one Utopia after another, being enunciated withenthusiasm and vigor, calling upon all the facts of faith and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    19science (as they existed at that moment in space-time) to corrob-orate the fantasy. A decade or maybe a century elapse—and thefantasy is no more. The Utopia has gone down the drain to joinall the other Utopias of earlier primates. However, I sincerelyhope that Wilson is right in this case.Now I am not unmindful of the fact that the Utopia of whichWilson speaks, echoing many of the best scientific and philo-sophic minds of our day, is a distinct possibility at some time, butthat it could occur within the next decade seems rather improba-ble to me. It seems improbable of course only in terms of thecurrent state of world enlightenment, or lack of it, and because itimplies a \"miracle\" occurring in vast numbers of living primatessimultaneously—whatever semantic theories are involved in themeaning of the word \"simultaneously.\"Anyway, this is a minor point considering the seminal bril-liance of the greater part of this enlightening book.In a previously written book, Wilson wrote that[in] 1964, Dr. John S. Bell published a demonstration that stillhas the physicists reeling. What Bell seemed to prove was thatquantum effects are 'non-local' in Bohm's sense; that is, theyare not just here or there, but both. What this apparently meansis that space and time are only real to our mammalian senseorgans; they are not really real.This writing reminds me so much of the Hindu concept ofIndra's Net. The latter is sometimes described as being a greatnet extending throughout the whole universe, vertically to repre-sent time, horizontally to represent space. At each point wherethe threads of this Indra's net cross one another is a diamond or acrystal bead, the symbol of a single existence. Each crystal beadreflects on its shining surface not only every other bead in thewhole net of Indra but every single reflection of every reflectionof every other bead upon each individual bead—countless,endless reflections of one another. We could also liken it to asingle candle being placed in the centre of a large hall. Aroundthis hall tens of mirrors are arranged in such a manner that, whenthe candle was lit, one saw not only its reflection in each indi-vidual mirror, but also the reflections of the reflections in everyother mirror repeated ad infinitum."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2O   Prometheus RisingOne of the several virtues of Prometheus Rising is that Wilsonusing Leary's neurological circuits believes that a new philo-sophical paradigm is about due. In reality, this is really Wilson'sanswer to my proposed criticism of his Utopian fantasy. It maynot be within a decade that we shall realize whether it is true orfalse. But that is not important. What is clear is that thanks to theinsights of many modern thinkers, major new intellectual find-ings do not come solely from the slow drip and grind of tiny newdiscoveries, or from new theories simply being added to our pre-sent armamentarium of time-honoured truisms. Rather, quantumleaps, in outlook ala Teilhard de Chardin, occur with a fantasticjump to a new horizon or level of perception. This insight usuallycomes from a revolutionary overview which realigns or trans-forms former thinking into a new and more enlightening frameof reference.This dovetails with his equally fascinating thesis that every-thing alive is really alive in the fullest and most dynamic senseof the word. It twitches, searches, throbs, organizes and seemsaware of an upward movement. Twitches seems almost the rightword, recalling to mind the myoclonisms of Wilhelm Reich'svegetotherapy which, at sometime, are infinitely disturbing to thepatient on the couch who, because of them, feels he is fallingapart, being shattered into a thousand pieces. He isn't really. It isas though the organism were gathering itself together for anupward or forward leap into the unknown, to a higher order oflooking at things.The transition to a higher order of functioning—or hookingon to a higher neural circuit—is often accompanied by consider-able anxiety or a turbulence in personal life which seems as if theorganism were falling apart or breaking up. This phenomenon ofinstability is really the way that every living organism—soci-eties, human primates, chemical solutions, etc.—shakes itself, asit were, by myoclonisms or similar convulsions into new combi-nations and permutations for higher and new levels of develop-ment. So perhaps the space-time Utopia of a new area of primateexploration has some validity after all, as indicating that themore vigorous the disturbance or myoclonism the greater thequantum jump into a higher neurological circuit. This is one"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   21reason why I firmly believe that the transition to the next spiralwill not be smooth nor without much suffering and chaos.All of which suggests, with Wilson and Leary, that the brainis considerably more sophisticated than any of us previously hadimagined. It is quite possible that it operates in dimensions sobeyond the lower neural circuitry that it occasionally \"throws usa bone\" every day so that we can continue to function in themake-believe world of everyday status quo. In the meantime, itis a multidimensional structure at ease in far more than thenarrow primate world we have been programmed to live in. Itmay interpret waves and frequencies from other dimensions,realms of \"light,\" of meaningful unrestricted patterned reality—that are here and now—and which transcend our present myopictunnel realities of our rigid perceptions and conceptualizations ofspace and time.If so, then the title of this book Prometheus Rising is repre-sentative of more than a catchy title to a profound fascinatingbook. It becomes a title, instead, to the very attempt which weare now making to reach beyond ourselves with a quantum leapinto a new world which has been envisaged only by a very few.Wilson is one of this group who are preparing themselves and ifwe allow them, the rest of us, to take our place in the New Aeon.I will close with a quote from Wilson,We are all giants, raised by pygmies, who have learned towalk with a perpetual mental crouch.

He is standing on the back ofanother turtle.\"\"Oh, I see,\" said Professor James, still being polite. \"Butwould you be so good as to tell me what holds up the secondturtle?\"\"It's no use, Professor,\" said the old lady, realizing he wastrying to lead her into a logical trap. \"It's turtles-turtles-turtles,all the way!\"Don't be too quick to laugh at this little old lady. All humanminds work on fundamentally similar principles. Her universewas a little bit weirder than most but it was built up on the samemental principles as every other universe people have believedin.As Dr. Leonard Orr has noted, the human mind behaves as ifit were divided into two parts, the Thinker and the Prover.The Thinker can think about virtually anything. Historyshows that it can think the earth is suspended on the backs ofinfinite turtles or that the Earth is hollow, or that the Earth isfloating in space4,1 comparative religion and philosophy showthat the Thinker can regard itself as mortal, as immortal, as bothmortal and immortal (the reincarnation model) or even as non-existent (Buddhism). It can think itself into living in a Christianuniverse, a Marxist universe, a scientific-relativistic universe, ora Nazi universe—among many possibilities.As psychiatrists and psychologists have often observed (muchto the chagrin of their medical colleagues), the Thinker can thinkitself sick, and can even think itself well again.The Prover is a much simpler mechanism. It operates on onelaw only: Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.To cite a notorious example which unleashed incrediblehorrors earlier in this century, if the Thinker thinks that all Jewsare rich, the Prover will prove it. It will find evidence that the1Millions of people believe that (including the present author).25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2(5   Prometheus Risingpoorest Jew in the most run-down ghetto has hidden moneysomewhere. Similarly, Feminists are able to believe that all men,including the starving wretches who live and sleep on the streets,are exploiting all women, including the Queen of England.If the Thinker thinks that the sun moves around the earth, theProver will obligingly organize all perceptions to fit that thought;if the Thinker changes its mind and decides the earth movesaround the sun, the Prover will reorganize the evidence.If the Thinker thinks \"holy water\" from Lourdes will cure itslumbago, the Prover will skillfully orchestrate all signals fromthe glands, muscles, organs etc. until they have organized them-selves into good health againOf course, it is fairly easy to see that other people's mindsoperate this way; it is comparatively much harder to becomeaware that one's own mind is working that way also.It is believed, for instance, that some men are more\"objective\" than others. (One seldom hears this about women...)Businessmen are allegedly hard-nosed, pragmatic and \"objec-tive\" in this sense. A brief examination of the dingbat politicsmost businessmen endorse will quickly correct that impression.Scientists, however, are still believed to be objective. Nostudy of the lives of the great scientists will confirm this. Theywere as passionate, and hence as prejudiced, as any assembly ofgreat painters or great musicians. It was not just the Church butalso the established astronomers of the time who condemnedGalileo. The majority of physicists rejected Einstein's SpecialRelativity Theory in 1905. Einstein himself would not acceptanything in quantum theory after 1920 no matter how manyexperiments supported it. Edison's commitment to direct current(DC) electrical generators led him to insist alternating current(AC) generators were unsafe for years after their safety had beenproven to everyone else.'Edison's pigheadedness on this matter was partly the result of hisjealousy against Nikola Tesla, inventor of AC generators. Tesla, onthe other hand, refused the Nobel Prize when it was offered to himand Edison jointly because he refused to appear on the same platformwith Edison. Both of these geniuses were only capable of \"objec-tivity\" and science in certain limited laboratory conditions. If you"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising27Science achieves, or approximates, objectivity not because theindividual scientist is immune from the psychological laws thatgovern the rest of us, but because scientific method—a groupcreation—eventually overrides individual prejudices, in the longrun.To take a notorious example from the 1960s, there was a pointwhen three research groups had \"proven\" that LSD causeschromosome damage, while three other groups had \"proven\" thatLSD has no effect on the chromosomes. In each case, the Proverhad proved what the Thinker thought. Right now, there are, inphysics, 7 experiments that confirm a very controversial conceptknown as Bell's Theorem, and two experiments that refute Bell'sTheorem. In the area of extra-sensory perception, the results areuniform after more than a century: everybody who sets out toprove that ESP exists succeeds, and everybody who sets out toprove that ESP does not exist also succeeds.\"Truth\" or relative truth emerges only after decades of exper-iments by thousands of groups all over the world.think you have a higher \"objectivity quotient\" than either of them,why haven't you been nominated for a Nobel prize?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28    Prometheus RisingIn the long run, we are hopefully approximating closer andcloser to \"objective Truth\" over the centuries.In the short run, Orr's law always holds:Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover will prove.'And if the Thinker thinks passionately enough, the Prover willprove the thought so conclusively that you will never talk aperson out of such a belief, even if it is something as remarkableas the notion that there is a gaseous vertebrate of astronomicalheft (\"GOD\") who will spend all eternity torturing people whodo not believe in his religion.EXERCIZESSad as it is to say, you never understand anything by merelyreading a book about it. That's why every science courseincludes laboratory experiments, and why every consciousness-liberation movement demands practice of yogas, meditations,confrontation techniques, etc. in which the ideas are tested in thelaboratory of your own nervous system.The reader will absolutely not understand this book unless heor she does the exercizes given at the end of each chapter.To explore the Thinker and the Prover, try the following:1. Visualize a quarter vividly, and imagine vividly that you aregoing to find the quarter on the street. Then, look for the quarterevery time you take a walk, meanwhile continuing to visualize it.See how long it takes you to find the quarter.2. Explain the above experiment by the hypothesis of \"selec-tive attention\"—that is, believe there are lots of lost quarterseverywhere and you were bound to find one by continually look-ing. Go looking for a second quarter.3. Explain the experiment by the alternative \"mystical\"hypothesis that \"mind controls everything.\" Believe that youmade the quarter manifest in this universe. Go looking for asecond quarter.If the reader is a scientist, be not alarmed. This refers not to you butonly to those benighted fools in the opposite camp who refuse to rec-ognize that your theory is the only reasonable one. Of course."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   294. Compare the time it takes to find the second quarter usingthe first hypothesis (attention) with the time it takes using thesecond hypothesis (mind-over-matter).5. With your own ingenuity, invent similar experiments andeach time compare the two theories—\"selective attention\"(coincidence) vs. \"mind controls everything\" (psychokinesis).6.

The Aristotelian ideathat to understand something you must know what it is has beenabandoned in one science after another, for the pragmatic reasonthat the simple word \"is\" introduces so many metaphysicalassumptions that we can argue forever about them. In the mostadvanced sciences, such as mathematical physics, nobody talksabout what anything is anymore. They talk about what model (ormap) can best be used to understand whatever we are investi-gating.In general, this scientific habit of avoiding \"is\" can be prof-itably extended to all areas of thought. Thus, when you readanywhere that A is B, it will clarify matters if you translate thisas \"A can be considered as, or modeled by, B.\"When we say A is B, we are saying that A is only what itappears within our field of study or our area of specialization.This is saying too much. When we say A can be considered as B,or modeled by B, we are saying exactly as much as we have aright to say, and no more.We therefore say that the brain can be considered as a com-puter; but we do not say it is a computer.The brain appears to be made up of matter in electro-colloidalsuspension (protoplasm).Colloids are pulled together, toward a condition of gel, bytheir surface tensions. This is because surface tensions pull allglue-like substances together.Colloids are also, conversely, pushed apart, toward a condi-tion of sol, by their electrical charges. This is because their elec-trical charges are similar, and similar electrical charges alwaysrepel each other.In the equilibrium between gel and sol, the colloidal suspen-sion maintains its continuity and life continues. Move the sus-pension too far toward gel, or too far toward sol, and life ends.Any chemical that gets into the brain, changes the gel-solbalance, and \"consciousness\" is accordingly influenced.

(Software here includes information).The hardware in a solid-state computer is concrete and local-ized, consisting of central processing unit, display, keyboard,external disk drive, CD-ROM, floppies, etc.—all the parts youcan drag into Radio Shack for repair if the computer is malfunc-tioning.The software consists of programs that can exist in manyforms, including the totally abstract. A program can be \"in\" thecomputer in the sense that it is recorded in the CPU or on a diskwhich is hitched up to the computer. A program can also exist ona piece of paper, if I invented it myself, or in a manual, if it is astandard program; in these cases, it is not \"in\" the computer butcan be put \"in\" at any time.

This may sound strange, but that's theway software (or information) functions.Of course, if consciousness consisted of nothing but thisundifferentiated tapioca of timeless, spaceless software, wewould have no individuality, no center, no Self.We want to know, then, how out of this universal softwareocean a specific person emerges.What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.Because the human brain, like other animal brains, acts as anelectro-colloidal computer, not a solid-state computer, it followsthe same laws as other animal brains. That is, the programs getinto the brain, as electro-chemical bonds, in discrete quantumstages.Each set of programs consists of four basic parts:1 . Genetic Imperatives. Totally hard-wired programs or\"instincts.\"2. Imprints. These are more-or-less hard wired programswhich the brain is genetically designed to accept only at certainpoints in its development. These points are known, in ethology,as times of imprint vulnerability.3. Conditioning. These are programs built onto the imprints.They are looser and fairly easy to change with counter-condi-tioning.4. Learning. This is even looser and \"softer\" than condition-ing.In general, the primordial imprint can always over-rule anysubsequent conditioning or learning. An imprint is a species ofsoftware that has become built-in hardware, being impressed onthe tender neurons when they are peculiarly open and vulnerable.Imprints (software frozen into hardware) are the non-nego-tiable aspects of our individuality.

As soon as thefirst imprint is made, structure emerges out of the creative void.The growing mind, alas, becomes trapped within this structure. Itidentifies with the structure; in a sense, it becomes the structure.This entire process is analyzed in G. Spencer Brown's Lawsof Form; and Brown was writing about the foundations of math-ematics and logic. But every sensitive reader knows that Brownis also talking about a process we have all passed through increating, out of an infinite ocean of signals, those particularconstructs we call \"myself and \"my world.\" Not surprisingly,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"4O   Prometheus Risingmany acid-heads have said that Brown's math is the best descrip-tion ever written of an LSD trip.Each successive imprint complicates the software whichprograms our experience and which we experience as \"reality.\"Conditioning and learning build further networks onto thisbedrock of imprinted software. The total structure of this brain-circuitry makes up our map of the world. It is what our Thinkerthinks, and our Prover mechanically fits all incoming signals tothe limitations of this map.Following Dr. Timothy Leary (with a few modifications) weshall divide this brain hardware into eight circuits for conven-ience. (\"For convenience\" means that this is the best map I knowat present. I assume it will be replaced by a better map within 10or 15 years; and in any case, the map is not the territory.)Four of the circuits are \"antique\" and conservative, they existin everybody (except feral children).1. The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit. This is imprinted by themother or the first mothering object and conditioned bysubsequent nourishment or threat. It is primarily concerned withsucking, feeding, cuddling, and body security. It retreatsmechanically from the noxious or predatory—or from anythingassociated (by imprinting or conditioning) with the noxious orpredatory.2. The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit. This is imprintedin the \"Toddling\" stage when the infant rises up, walks about andbegins to struggle for power within the family structure. Thismostly mammalian circuit processes territorial rules, emotionalgames, or cons, pecking order and rituals of domination orsubmission.3. The Time-Binding Semantic Circuit. This is imprinted andconditioned by human artifacts and symbol systems. It \"handles\"and \"packages\" the environment, classifying everything accord-ing to the local reality tunnel. Invention, calculation, predictionand transmitting signals across generations are its functions.4. The \"Moral\" Socio-Sexual Circuit. This is imprinted by thefirst orgasm-mating experiences at puberty and is conditioned bytribal taboos. It processes sexual pleasure, local definitions of\"right\" and \"wrong,\" reproduction, adult-parental personality(sex role) and nurture of the young."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   41The development of these circuits as the brain evolvedthrough evolution, and as each domesticated primate (human)brain recapitulates evolution in growing from infancy to adult-hood, makes possible gene-pool survival, mammalian sociobiol-ogy (pecking order, or politics) and transmission of culture.The second group of four brain circuits is much newer, andeach circuit exists at present only in minorities.

It consists, in modern terms, of cybernetic con-sciousness, reprogramming and reimprinting all other circuits,even reprogramming itself, making possible conscious choicebetween alternative universes or reality tunnels.8. The Non-Local Quantum Circuit. This is imprinted byShock, by \"near-death\" or \"clinical death\" experience, byOOBEs (out-of-body-experiences), by trans-time perceptions(\"precognition\"), by trans-space visions (ESP), etc. It tunes thebrain into the non-local quantum communication system sug-gested by physicists such as Bohm, Walker, Sarfatti, Bell, etc.These circuits will be explained in detail as we proceed."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42    Prometheus RisingEXERCIZES1.

And do try thecanapes, Mrs. Miller). Some chew their lips, gobble tranks anduppers, even munch their mustaches. What goes on in thebedroom is known to the Kinsey Institute and anyone who hasseen a porn film.How important is this oral imprinting? We read of a babygiraffe whose mother was accidentally killed by a jeep immedi-ately after birth. The neonate, following hard-wired geneticprograms, \"imprinted\" the first object that roughly fit the giraffearchetype—the jeep itself. He followed the machine around,vocalized to it, attempted to suckle from it, and, when adult, triedto mate with it.Similarly, Konrad Lorenz tells of a gosling who accidentallyimprinted a ping-pong ball and spent his adult life, indifferent tofemale geese, attempting to sexually mount ping-pong balls.As Charles Darwin noted:In our maturer years, when an object of vision is presented tous which bears any similitude to the form of the femalebosom...we feel a general glow of delight which seems toinfluence all of our senses...The ancients pictured the great mother goddess Diana ofEphesus with literally dozens of breasts and St. Paul reportshearing her worshippers chanting rapturously \"Great is Diana!\"There is virtually no great artist who has not left us a portrait, ormany portraits, of the nude female form, especially the breasts;47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48   Prometheus Risingand even in non-human scenes, curves are introduced whereverpossible.

As for music—where did we firsthear it, who sang or hummed to us, and against what part of herbody were we held?Mountain climbers are reduced, like Mallory, to saying\"Because it's there,\" when trying to explain their compulsion toascend those conic peaks.Our eating utensils (oral gratification tools) tend to berounded or curved. Square plates or saucers look \"campy\" orstrange.UFOs come in a variety of shapes, but the most popular arethe oval and conic.Freudians suggest that opiate addiction is an attempt to returnto the womb. In keeping with our theory, it is more likely thatopium and its derivatives return us to the \"safe space\" on the bio-survival circuit, the warm, snug place of bio-security; opiatesmay trigger neuro-transmitters' characteristic of breast-feeding.In summary: the bio-survival circuit is DNA-programmed toseek a comfort-safety zone around a mothering organism. If amother isn't present, the closet substitute in the environment willbe imprinted. For the orphan giraffe, a four-wheeled jeep waschosen to stand in for the four-legged mother.

Radicalpediatricians insist, with good evidence, that childbirth byconventional means in a conventional hospital is almost alwaystraumatic for the newborn—creates a bad imprint, in our lan-guage. Our child-rearing methods are far from ideal also, addingbad conditioning on top of bad imprinting. And the generalviolence of our societies to date—including wars, revolutions,civil wars and the \"undeclared civil war\" of the predatory crimi-nal class in every \"civilized\" nation—keeps the first circuit ofmost people in an emergency state far too much of the time.In 1968, a U.S. Public Health survey showed that 85% of thepopulation had one or more symptoms that we would call badfirst-circuit imprinting or conditioning. These symptomsincluded dizzy spells, heart palpitations, wet palms and frequentnightmares.This means that 85 out of the next 100 people you meetshould be regarded as, more or less, \"the Walking Wounded.\"This is the first level of meaning in our brutal, cynicalproposition that most people are almost as mechanical as sci-firobots. A man or woman entering a new situation with the anxi-ety chemicals1 of a frightened infant coursing through the brainstem is not going to be able to observe, judge or decide anythingvery accurately.And this is why Gurdjieff said, in his own jargon, that peopleare asleep and having nightmares.\"FAIRNESS?

One is not conscious of time at all on the bio-survivalcircuit. Observe the speed of your dog's reaction at the firstsound of an intruder: the threatening bark, and the movement ofthe whole body to alert status, is automatic. Then the dog startstaking in other cues, to determine how this particular intrudershould be treated.As Robert Ardrey reports the remarks of primatologist RayCarpenter, to understand this part of your brain...Imagine that you are a monkey and you're running along apath past a rock and unexpectedly meet face to face anotheranimal. Now, before you know whether to attack it, to flee it,or to ignore it, you must make a series of decisions. Is itmonkey or non-monkey? If non-monkey, is it pro-monkey oranti-monkey? If monkey, is it male or female? If female, is sheinterested? If male, is it adult or juvenile? If adult, is it of mygroup or some other?... You have about one fifth of a secondto make all these decisions, or you could be attacked.The bio-survival program first attaches to the safe spacearound the mother (oral imprint), and then with age movesfurther and further out, exploring what is safe and what is not.Without hard-wired genetic programs (i.e., automatic programs)this second stage would be impossible, and no mammal wouldever leave the teat.

This allows thesafe-space perimeter to be generalized outward from themother's body to the pack or tribe—the \"extended family.\"Every social animal has, in addition to the Darwinian\"instinct\" (genetic program) of self-preservation, a similar\"instinct\" to protect the gene-pool. This is the basis of altruism,and social animals could not survive without it.Wild dogs (and wolves) bark to warn the rest of the pack thatan intruder is coming. Your domesticated dog identifies you as apack-leader; he barks to warn you that an intruder is coming. (Healso barks, of course, to warn the intruder that he is ready to fightfor his territory.)As civilization has advanced, the pack-bond (the tribe, theextended family) has been broken. This is the root of the widelydiagnosed \"anomie\" or \"alienation\" or \"existential anguish\"about which so many social critics have written so eloquently.What has happened is that the conditioning of the bio-survivalbond to the gene-pool has been replaced by a conditioning ofbio-survival drives to hook onto the peculiar tickets which wecall \"money\".Concretely, a modern man or woman doesn't look for bio-survival security in the gene-pool, the pack, the extended family.Bio-survival depends on getting the tickets. \"You can't livewithout money,\" as the Living Theatre troop used to cry out inanguish. If the tickets are withdrawn, acute bio-survival anxietyappears at once.Imagine, as vividly as possible, what you would feel, andwhat you would do, if all your sources to bio-survival tickets(money) were cut off tomorrow. This is precisely what tribalmen and women feel if cut off from the tribe; it is why exile, oreven ostracism, were sufficient punishments to enforce tribalconformity throughout most of human history. As recently asShakespeare's day the threat of exile was an acute terror signal(\"Banished!\" cries Romeo, \"the damned use that word in Hell!\")In traditional society, belonging to the tribe was bio-security;exile was terror, and real threat of death. In modern society,having the tickets (money) is bio-security; having the ticketswithdrawn is terror."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Prometheus RisingWelfare-ism, socialism, totalitarianism, etc. represent at-tempts, in varying degrees of rationality and hysteria, to re-createthe tribal bond by making the State stand-in for the gene-pool.Conservatives who claim that no form of Welfare is tolerable tothem are asking that people live with total bio-survival anxietyand anomie combined with terror. The conservatives, of course,vaguely recognize this and ask for \"local charity\" to replaceState Welfare — i.e., they ask for the gene-pool to be restored bymagic, among people (denizens of a typical city) who are notgenetically related at all.On the other hand, the State is not a gene-pool or a tribe, andcannot really play the bio-survival unit convincingly. Everybodyon Welfare becomes paranoid, because they are continually wor-rying that they are going to get cut off (\"exiled\") for some minorinfraction of the increasingly incomprehensible bureaucraticrules. And in real totalitarianism, in which the bogus identifica-tion of the State with the tribe is carried to the point of a newmysticism, the paranoia becomes total.Real bonding can only occur in face-to-face groups of reason-able size. Hence, the perpetual attempt (however implausible inindustrial circumstances) to decentralize, to go back to the tribalethos, to replace the State with syndicates (as in anarchism) oraffinity-groups (Reich's \"Consciousness III\"). Recall the hippiecrash-pad of the sixties, which lives on in many rural communes.Back in the real world, the tickets called \"money\" are the bio-survival bond for most people. Anti-Semitism is a complexaberration, of many facets and causes, but in its classic form (the\"Jewish Bankers' Conspiracy\") it simply holds that a hostilegene-pool controls the tickets for bio-security. Such paranoia isinevitable in a money economy; junkies have similar mythsabout who controls the supply of heroin. Thus, as anti-Semitismhas declined in America, the \"Bankers' Conspiracy\" lives on in anew form.

Douglas, the engineer and economist, once made up achart, which he showed to the MacMillan Commission in 1932when they were discussing money and credit regulation.

Every time the inter-est rate went up, so did the suicide rate; when interest wentdown, so did suicide. This can hardly be \"coincidence.\" Wheninterest rises, a certain number of businessmen go bankrupt, acertain number of workers are thrown out of their jobs, andeverybody's bio-survival anxiety generally increases.Marxists and other radicals are urgently aware of such factorsin \"mental health\" and hence scornful of all types of academicpsychology which ignore these bio-survival issues. Unfortu-nately, the Marxist remedy—making everybody dependent forbio-survival on the whims of a State bureaucracy—is a cureworse than the disease.Bio-survival anxiety will only permanently disappear whenworld-wide wealth has reached a level, and a distribution, where,without totalitarianism, everyone has enough tickets.The Hunger Project, the idea of the Guaranteed AnnualIncome, Douglas' National Dividend plan, etc. represent gropingtoward that goal.

You will very quickly get anidea of what is bothering them. This is why all schools of yoga—Buddhist, Hindu or Sufi—place such emphasis on restoring natu-ral breathing before trying to move the student on to highercircuits and wider consciousness.This is of more than \"psychological\" import. Every study ofthe psychosomatic aspects of cancer and asthma, for instance,finds this pattern of chronic muscular contraction (subjectivelyfelt as anxiety) among the predisposing factors. What theThinker thinks, the Prover proves. People are strangling theirinner organs every day because they are afraid.Mary Baker Eddy may have been exaggerating slightly whenshe said, \"All illness is manifested fear;\" but holistic medicinemore and more recognizes that if that damned word \"all\" isreplaced by a more tentative \"most,\" Mrs. Eddy was close to thefacts.Even old-fangled M.D.s who won't consider holistic ideas fora minute, admit that some persons are mysteriously \"more sus-ceptible\" to disease than other persons. What is this metaphysical\"susceptibility\"? Anthropologist Ashley Montagu has collectednumerous statistics on children who were deprived of maternallove at the crucial point of imprint vulnerability in infancy. Theynot only died younger than the national average, but were sicklierall their lives and even grew up to be several inches shorter thanthe average adult height for their sex.What makes for \"susceptibility\" (aside from possible geneticfactors) can only be such an anxiety imprint (muscle tension) onthe first circuit.Christian Science—or any other religion that dogmaticallyinsists that \"God\" wants us to be happy and successful—can"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"55   Prometheus Risingcure such conditions \"miraculously.\" What the Thinker thinks theProver proves. Absolute faith that \"God\" is supporting you,beamed out from the brain all day long, day after day, signals themuscles to relax, and natural buoyancy and health returns.Throughout human life, when the bio-survival circuit sensesdanger, all other mental activity ceases. All other circuits shutdown until the bio-survival problem is \"solved,\" realistically orsymbolically. This is of crucial importance in mind-washing andbrain-programming.To create a new imprint, first reduce the subject to the state ofinfancy, i.e., bio-survival vulnerability. We will enlarge upon thislater.In pre-neurological terms, the bio-survival circuit is what weusually call \"consciousness,\" per se. It is the sense of being here-now, in this vulnerable body, subject to the raw energies andforces of the physical universe. When we are \"unconscious,\" thebio-survival circuit is turned off and doctors may cut us up with-out our attempting to flee or even crying out.EXERCIZES1.

This \"patriotic\"circuit is built into all vertebrates and is perhaps 500 million to1000 million years old. In the modern human it seems to becentralized in the thalamus—the \"back brain\" or \"old brain\" andis linked with the voluntary nervous system and the muscles.This circuit appears in each newborn when the DNA mastertape sends out RNA messenger molecules to trigger the mutationfrom neonate to \"toddler,\" which involves first of all standingerect. Walking, mastering gravity, overcoming physical obstaclesand learning to manipulate others politically are the vulnerablepoints at which imprinting and heavy conditioning occur. Themuscles that perform these power functions are quickly pro-grammed with what become chronic, life-long reflexes.Depending as always the accidents of the environment—whathappens at points of neurological vulnerability—this circuit willorganize itself into a strong, dominating role in the pack (orfamily) or a weak, submissive role. Without going into thejungles with the ethologists, one can observe this mammalianimprinting process in any litter of puppies. It is very quicklydetermined who is TOP DOG and who is BOTTOM DOG.Status in the pack or tribe is assigned on the basis of pre-verbal signaling system (kinesics) in which these muscle reflexesare crucial. All of the emotional games or cons listed in thepopular psychological game-manuals of Dr. Eric Berne and theTransactional Analysts are second-circuit imprints, or standardmammalian politics.To quote from my novel Schrodinger's Cat:Most of the domesticated primates of Terra did not know theywere primates. They thought they were something apart fromand \"superior\" to the rest of the planet.Even Benny Benedict's \"One Month to Go\" column wasbased on that illusion. Benny had actually read Darwin once,in college a long time ago, and had heard of sciences likeethology and ecology, but the facts of evolution had neverreally registered on him. He never thought of himself as aprimate. He never realized his friends and associates wereprimates. Above all, he never understood that the alpha malesof Unistat were typical leaders of primate bands. As a result ofthis inability to see the obvious, Benny was constantly alarmed"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64   Prometheus Risingand terrified by the behavior of himself, his friends and associ-ates and especially the alpha males of the pack. Since he didn'tknow it was ordinary primate behavior, it seemed just awful tohim.Since a great deal of primate behavior was considered justawful, most of the domesticated primates spent most of theirtime trying to conceal what they were doing.Some of the primates got caught by other primates. All ofthe primates lived in dread of getting caught.Those who got caught were called no-good shits.The term no-good shit was a deep expression of primatepsychology. For or instance, one wild primate (a chimpanzee)taught sign language by two domesticated primates (scientists)spontaneously put together the signs for \"shit\" and \"scientist\"to describe a scientist she didn't like. She was calling him shit-scientist. She also put together the signs for \"shit\" and\"chimpanzee\" for another chimpanzee she didn't like. She wascalling him shit-chimpanzee.\"You no-good shit,\" domesticate primates often said toeach other.This metaphor was deep in primate psychology becauseprimates mark their territories with excretions, and sometimesthey threw excretions at each other when disputing over terri-tories.One primate wrote a long book describing in vivid detailhow his political enemies should be punished. He imaginedthem in an enormous hole in the ground, with flames andsmoke and rivers of shit. This primate was named DanteAlighieri.Another primate wrote that every primate infant goesthrough a stage of being chiefly concerned with bio-survival,i.e., food, i.e., Mommie's Titty. He called this the Oral Stage.He said the infant next went on to a stage of learning mam-malian politics, i.e., recognizing the Father (alpha-male) andhis Authority and territorial demands. He called this, with aninsight that few primates shared, the Anal Stage.This primate was named Freud. He had taken his ownnervous system apart and examined its component circuits byperiodically altering its structure with neurochemicals.Among the anal insults exchanged by domesticated pri-mates when fighting for their space were: \"Up your ass,\" \"Goshit in your hat,\" \"You're full of shit,\" and many others."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    65One of the most admired alpha-males in the Kingdom ofthe Franks was General Canbronne. General Canbronne wonthis adulation for the answer he gave when asked to surrenderat Waterloo.\"Merde,\" was the answer General Canbronne gave.The word petard means a kind of bomb. It comes from thesame Olde English root as fart.General Canbronne's mentality was typical of the alpha-males of the military caste.When primates went to war or got violent in other ways,they always said they were about to knock the shit out of theenemy.They also spoke of dumping on each other.The standard \"authority\" reflex on the emotional-territorialcircuit is to swell the muscles and howl. You will find thisamong birds as well as mammals, and in the Board meeting ofyour local bank. The standard \"submission\" reflex is to shrinkthe muscles, lower the head, and \"crawl away.\" You will findthis among dogs, primates, fowl and employees who wish tokeep their jobs everywhere.If the first (bio-survival) circuit is chiefly imprinted by themother, the second (emotional-territorial) circuit is chieflyimprinted by the father—the nearest alpha male. It has beenproposed, by sociologist G. Rattray Taylor that societies swingback and forth between \"Matrist\" periods, in which motherly"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66Prometheus Risingoral values predominate, and \"Patrist\" periods, in which fatherlyanal values are in ascendance.THE STANDARD AUTHORITY REFLEX"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   6jTaylor's table of the characteristics of these \"Matrist\" and\"Patrist\" periods is as follows:Whether or not societies wobble between these extremes asTaylor claims, individuals certainly do. These are merely theconsequences of (a) having the heaviest imprint on the oral(Matrist) bio-survival circuit or (b) having the heaviest imprinton the anal (Patrist) territorial circuit.In pre-ethological terms, the emotional-territorial circuit iswhat we usually call \"ego.\" Ego is simply the mammalian recog-nition of one's status in the pack; it is a \"role\" as sociologistssay, a single brain circuit which mistakes itself for the wholeSelf, the entire brain-mind apparatus. The \"egotist\" behaves like\"a two year old,\" in the common saying, because Ego is theimprint of the toddling and toilet-training stage.The question of how human an animal is (especially a pet dogor cat) never ceases to divide scientists from laypersons—andone scientist from another. In terms of the present theory, thedifferences between domesticated primates (humans) and otherdomesticated animals are virtually nil, as long as we are talkingonly about the first two circuits. (Since most people spend mostof their time on these primitive circuits, the differences are often"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68Prometheus Risingmuch less obvious than the similarities.) Real differences beginto appear when the third, semantic circuit enters the picture.MOST MAMMALS MARK THEIR TERRITORIES WITHEXCRETIONS. DOMESTICATED PRIMATES MARK THEIRTERRITORIES WITH INK EXCRETIONS ON PAPER.For instance, novice dog-trainers always make the mistake ofusing too many words. Because the dog is so \"human\" in somany ways (canines, like primates, are great mimics), the noviceimputes too much \"humanity\" to them. The average dog has avocabulary of around 150 words, and within that semanticuniverse is quite bright. It is very easy to teach a dog the mean-ing of \"Sit,\" \"Stay,\" \"Attack,\" etc.; and the dog will learn themeaning of \"walk\" and \"food\" even without your trying to teachhim. The problem begins when the novice expects the dog tounderstand something like \"No, no, Fritz—anywhere else in thebedroom, but not on the bed.\" Even a non-English-speakinghuman would not grasp that, except vaguely.

For instance, my wife, a sociologist,trained our dog, Fang, not to beg at the table in the most directmammalian language possible. She simply growled at him thefirst few times he approached her while she was eating. (She hadbeen reading ethology, of course.) Fang understood fully; hesoon learned to avoid the table while the Pack-Leaders (my wifeand myself) were eating. His genetic programs told him we werethe Big Dogs, or as close to the Big Dogs as he could find in thatenvironment; dogs, like wolves, have a genetic program aboutnot annoying the Big Dogs while they're eating. The growl toldhim all he needed to know about the local parameters of thatrule. Fang, incidentally, was a Dachshund-Labrador mix, andstrange-looking to most humans. People would stop me on thestreet while I was walking him and ask, \"What...IS.. .that???\"Persons (extreme cases) who take the heaviest imprint on thisterritorial-emotional circuit tend to be musculotonic. That is,they hold most of their attention and energy, in the muscularattack-defense systems and grow up medium weight—heavyenough to be hard to knock down, light enough to be quick andsinewy. Often, they become body-builders, weight-lifters etc.and have an extraordinary absorption in demonstrating theirstrength. (Even shaking hands with them, you get the messagethat they are not exchanging amity but demonstrating power.)Most societies shunt these types into the military where theirpropensities are put to proper ethological use, defending thetribal turf.

For instance, in the terminology of the medievalpsychology of \"humours,\" these four imprint-types are known as:Clockwise, the Sanguinary type (friendly strength) was iden-tified with the Lion archetype and the element, fire. The Lion,because of the dignity of these big cats, represents \"good\"strength, and the fire represents power. The Phlegmatic type(friendly weakness) was identified with the Angel archetype andthe element water: these people are \"too sensitive to fight\" and\"go with the flow.\" The Choleric types were identified with theBull archetype (truculent suspicion, paranoia) and the element,earth, standing for sluggish pseudo \"stupidity.\" (This is the tradi-tional stance of defeated races dealing with their conquerors.)The Bilius types (hostile strength) were identified with the Eaglearchetype (symbol of Imperial Rome, the German royal family,etc.) and the element air, air probably means sky, because thesetypes seem \"high and mighty.\"These symbols go back a long way; Cabalists find them in theOld Testament (where, indeed, the lion-angel-bull-eagle appearin Ezekiel). They are found constantly in Catholic art, associatedwith the four evangelists (Matthew-angel, Mark-lion, Luke-bull,John-eagle)1 and run all through the design of Tarot card decks,medieval and modern.1 These are the Four Old Men in Finnegans Wake.

They are not-okay, but they havegreat faith that the therapist is okay.The Bilius (hostile strength) and Choleric (hostile weakness)arrive in therapy, if at all, only because their associates or fami-lies, or more commonly, a law court, has ordered them to try toreimprint their compulsive hostilities.The Sanguinary (friendly strength) type virtually never comesfor psychotherapy. He or she is satisfied with his or her life, andso is the rest of society. Alas, they nonetheless can get to theposition where they need therapy of some sort, simply becausethey may take on too much responsibility and carry too manyburdens. They will generally arrive at the therapists only if sentthere by an M.D. who has intuited where their ulcers came from.This system is not meant to be rigid or to imply that there areonly four types of humanoid robots. The later circuits, still to bediscussed, modify all this considerably: some imprints are wob-bly (cover two or more quadrants partly); and we are all capableof sudden brain change. It is also important to realize that thefour archetypes are for convenience only—and they are conve-nient, as witness their reappearance in Transactional Analysis,where their historical connection with Lion-Angel-Bull-Eagleisn't even recognized.

In the grid on which the Leary categories are drawn, themoderate imprints are in toward the center and the excessive orextreme cases are out toward the perimeter, but what is beingmeasured is still basically the way the first two circuits (oral-bio-survival and anal-territorial) are imprinted.To clarify this a bit further, imagine that four babies were allborn at the same instant in John J.

We will not attempt to decide that diffi-cult question here, since any attempt to decide what aspects ofbehavior are genetic and what are learned after birth alwaysdescends into ideological metaphysics in the prevailing absenceof real data. We say merely that, whether or not you or I wereborn with a predisposition for one quadrant, all organisms areborn with a predisposition for imprint vulnerability, and theimprint, once set in the neural circuitry, acts as robotically as anygenetic hard-wiring.How imprints can be changed will be discussed as weproceed. The exercizes in each chapter are intended to makeimprints a little less rigid, a little more flexible.The top two quadrants of the Leary grid—Friendly Strengthand Hostile Strength—correspond roughly to what Nietzschecalled Herrenmoral, the ethics of ruling classes. Indeed, HostileStrength is the embodiment of Nietzsche's \"Blond Beast,\" theprimitive conqueror-pirate type we find at the dawn of everycivilization. This is what Nietzsche also called the \"animal\" or\"unsublimated\" form of the Will to Power.(Friendly Strength on the other hand does not correspond,except very slightly, to Nietzsche's \"sublimated Will to Power.\"To find that we will have to wait until we come to the Fifth[Neurosomatic] Circuit—the stage of Conscious Evolution.)The bottom two quadrants—Friendly Weakness and HostileWeakness—correspond to Nietzsche's Sklavmoral, the ethics ofslaves, serfs and \"lower\"-caste or \"lower\"-class personseverywhere.

The evangel of Jesus, as Nietzsche saw it, was thesublimated Will to Power, the path of conscious evolution toSuperhumanity. The dysangel, the bad news, created by St. Paulwas traditional Sklavmoral—\"Slaves, obey your masters,\" butnourish your resentment with the firm belief that you are \"good,\"and they are \"evil,\" and you will eventually have the pleasure ofwatching them burn in hell forever. In Nietzsche's analysis, allMarx added to this was the idea of burning and punishing theMaster Class here and now instead of waiting for \"God\" toattend to the matter post mortem.The same analysis appears in e.e. cummings' unforgettablecouplet on the Communist intelligentsia of the 1930s:every kumrad is a little bitof concentrated hateIt is interesting, in this connection, that Nietzsche dropped\"psychological\" language from his books as he went along andreplaced it with \"physiological\" language. For instance, in hislater works, such as The Anti-Christ, the \"resentment\" withinslave-morality (conventional Christianity) is diagnosed as aphysiological reaction characteristic of certain physical types.Nietzsche was on the right track, but lacking neurology helooked for the physical basis of these processes in genetics alone.Imprinting theory suggests, on the contrary, that such physiolog-ical Bottom Dog reflexes are created by specific triggers at earlymoments of imprint vulnerability.But they are nonetheless all-over-the-body-at-once and hencephysiological. Any Method Actor knows this and his body willswell physically if he is playing a strong character and shrink ifhe is playing a weakling.

Thus, with Leary's 1957 schemata,we can further sub-divide our 4 types into 16 types with 4degrees of each, for a total of 64 sub-types.In the next section, to simplify what may be growing toocomplex, we will reduce everything again just to the inter-actions of the first two circuits.Any system for describing human behavior should be flexibleenough to be extended indefinitely, and should also still containmeaning when reduced back to its fundamentals.Since we all contain a territorial-emotional circuit we need toexercize it daily.Playing with children is one good exercize—especially if youplay with large groups, in which case you will have to refereemammalian territorial disputes. Swimming, jogging or whateverelse appeals to you is good, to keep the muscles from feeling youare trying to starve them. Trying to \"psych out\" somebody else'semotional state is one of the best exercizes for this circuit, and isvery educational in general. It activates the old mammal centersin the thalamus where body-language communicates emotionalsignals.A good General uses this circuit to \"psych out\" what theenemy General is planning. A good mother uses it, vice versa, tofigure out what baby's howl means in each particular case.Advanced work with this circuit, involving some hazards inpersonal relations, would involve such games as learning to bullysomebody if you've never been able to do that before, learning tosubmit docilely if you've never been able to do that before, andlearning to express anger appropriately and letting go of it whenit is no longer necessary.It will be observed by the thoughtful or visually-orientedreaders that each \"extreme\" type can be expressed on the LearyGrid as a very off-center pie-slice:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82Prometheus RisingObviously, an ideally \"balanced\" person—that is, one notrobotized and able to adjust to circumstances as they arise—would not be so off-centered.

David undergoes somemonumental lashings on the buttocks (for his own good, ofcourse, although Dickens emphasizes in a quite Freudian way theobvious enjoyment Murdstone obtains from these sessions).Quite naturally, David begins to internalize this anal system ofvalues and imagines he is quite a guilty little wretch and richlydeserves this torture. Then Dickens inserts the following scene,when David returns from a year at school:I went in with quiet, timid step. God knows how infantile thememory may have been that was awakened in me at the soundof my mother's voice in the old parlour when I set foot in thehall. I think I must have laid in her arms and heard her singingto me when I was but a baby. The strain was new to me but itwas so old that it filled my heart brimful like a friend comeback from a long absence.I believed from the solitary and thoughtful way in whichmy mother murmured her song that she was alone, and I wentsoftly into the room. She was sitting by the fire, suckling aninfant whose tiny hand she held against her neck. Her eyeswere looking down upon its face and she sat singing to it. Iwas so far right that she had no other companion. I spoke toher and she started and cried out. But seeing me she called meher dear Davy, her own boy: and coming half way across theroom to meet me, kneeled down upon the ground and kissedme, and laid my head down on her bosom near the littlecreature that was nestling there, and put its hand up to my lips."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88    Prometheus RisingI wish I had died.

Specifically, right-handedness is ahuman, or at least a primate, trait. Other mammals show noright-hand preference; they are ambidextrous.Recent neurology has shown that our right-handedness isintimately connected with our tendency to use the left hemi-sphere of the brain more than the right.

Indeed, we use the right hemisphere solittle in ordinary life that for a long time it was called \"the silenthemisphere.\"Thus, there is a genetic (hard-wired) preference, in mosthumans, for right-handed manipulations and left-brain menta-tions. Now these connections seem intimately involved with ourverbal, semantic circuitry, because the left brain is the \"talking\"brain. It is linear, analytical, computer-like and very verbal.Thus, there is a neurological basis for the linkage between map-ping and manipulating. The right hand manipulates the universe(and makes artifacts) and the left-brain maps the results into amodel, which allows for predictions about future behavior of thatpart of the universe. These are the distinctly human (post-primate) characteristics.The left-handed, on the contrary, specialize in right-brainfunctions, which are holistic, supra-verbal, \"intuitive,\" musicaland \"mystical.\" Leonardo, Beethoven and Nietzsche, forinstance, were all left-handed.

Positive feedback seeks a moving goal,like a guided missile.)The first two circuits maintain that which is (more or less)constant in human affairs.

Hethen reckoned that it took most of that time to arrive at Galileo,the scientific method, the beginnings of the Industrial Revolu-tion, and the great leap forward in energy utilization characteris-tic of the \"modern\" age, or the Open Society.Since 300 is the inverse square of 90,000, Adams assumedthat the next great leap was happening while he was writing,around 1900—300 years after Galileo. Looking about him, hedecided this next jump to higher energy was occurring in theresearches of the Curies, :who had discovered radioactivity. Asmany commentators have noted, it is impossible to read Adamson this subject without feeling that he is very accurately forecast-ing the Atomic Age.Adams went further, with the exhilaration of a great idea.Since 17 plus is the inverse square of 300, he predicted that thenext great evolutionary stage would begin in 1917 plus. And,since the inverse square of 17 is 4 plus, he predicted the next stepin around 1922. By then, he said, we should have infinite energyat our disposal. It didn't quite work out that way.Nevertheless, Henry Adams was on the right track. His mathwas just over-simplified.Also \"on the right track\" was Henry's brother, Brooks, whowas also looking for \"laws\" in history. Brooks observed a patternwhich may or may not be entirely true but is as approximatelytrue as the similar generalizations of Vico, Hegel, Marx andToynbee. Every civilization, Brooks Adams proposed, goesthrough four stages:"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    1091.The monopolization of knowledge by priests. E.g., theEgyptian priests kept written language a secret among them-selves, as did the May an priests.2. The monopolization of military power by conquerors whomade themselves States or governments. E.g., \"a French bastard\"(Tom Paine's description of William the Conqueror) lands on theshore of England with a superior technology—warriors on horseversus native warriors on foot—and he becomes King. His rela-tives and sycophants become Lords-of-the-land.3. The monopolization of the land by these land-Lords. Theextraction of tribute (\"rent\") from those who live on the land.4. The monopolization of the issue of currency by NationalBanks. The extraction of tribute (\"interest\") for each piece ofcurrency put into circulation.Most civilizations seem to have gone through at least three ofthese stages, not always consecutively. Some have passedthrough all four.Brooks Adams also noted that centralized capital (the accu-mulation of wealth in the hands of a few inter-related families)seems to have been moving steadily West throughout recordedhistory. The first major accumulations are to be found in Sumer;the center of money-power then shifted to Egypt, to Greece, tothe Italian peninsula, to various parts of Germany, and then toLondon. At the time Brooks Adams was writing (c. 1900) he sawthe balance teetering between London and New York, and hepredicted that the decline of the English Empire would shift thebalance to New York within the first half of the 20th Century. Heseems to have been right. Brooks Adams had no theory as to whythis Westward movement of wealth had been going on for 6000years. He merely observed the pattern.The shift is still continuing, in the opinion of many. Forinstance, Carl Oglesby in The Cowboy vs. Yankee War, seesAmerican politics since 1950 dominated by a struggle between\"old Yankee wealth\" (the New York-Boston axis, whichreplaced London after 1900) and \"new Cowboy wealth\" (Texas-California oil-and-aerospace billionaires).

He dropped this idea later—his mathwas as inadequate as Henry Adam's—but it is worth looking atfor a moment, to retrace the steps by which the actual Law ofAcceleration was discovered.What Korzybski assumed at first was that if all the inventions,discoveries, etc. of some hypothetical first generation of humanscould be represented by P, and the rate by which the secondgeneration could surpass this by R, then, mathematically, thesum total of inventions, discoveries etc. at the end of the secondgeneration would be PR. Quite true, algebraically. Then, after athird generation, the stockpile would be PRR. And after fourgenerations, PRRR.Generalized, this becomes PRt, where (t) is the number ofgenerations from whatever generation you have picked as yourbase-line.The curve of PRt, if you put it on graph paper, ascends morerapidly with each generation. Korzybski was looking straight atwhat Alvin Toffler later called \"Future Shock\" and was trying towrite a mathematical formula for it.Many variables in economic-technological history do, in fact,fit Korzybski's PRt function; but others do not. The math, again,was too simple; and everything does not change at the same rate.Nonetheless, Korzybski, like Henry Adams, was groping towardthe truth: acceleration is real, and it is intimately connected withtime-binding, the passing of signals between generations.What underlies the accelerations noted by Henry Adams andKorzybski is nowadays known as the selection of negentropy outof stochastic processes.

If you know something already, or can predict iteasily on the basis of what you do know, it is not information foryou. Conversely, if you don't know something, or can't predictit, it is information.The dynamism of evolution, we repeat, is the selection ofinformation, coherence, out of a random series of events.

If this is still obscure, try it in termsof Bateson's elegant simplification: \"Information is differencethat makes a difference.\"Information is also known mathematically as negative entropyor, in a widely used abbreviation, negentropy.Entropy is a measure of the deadness of a system. Negentropyor information is a measure of the liveliness of a system.Evolution is always a matter of at least two stochastic pro-cesses, each one acting as \"selector\" of the other(s). That is, innon-living systems, where no such \"selection\" is involved,entropy (lack of coherence) steadily increases, as stated in thefamous Second Law of Thermodynamics. In living systems, dueto stochastic co-selection, negentropy (information) steadilyincreases. In Schrodinger's phrase, \"Life feeds on negative entro-py.\" Life is an ordering, selecting, coherence-making process.Without getting embroiled in metaphysics, life (evolution)behaves as if it were always aiming at higher coherence, i.e.,higher intelligence.This process accelerates because it is, as Shannon demon-strated mathematically, logarithmic. Logarithmic processes aresuch that if you put them on graph paper, the curve rises moreand more all the time.Hence, the accelerations noted by Adams and Korzybski arehuman increments in a process that has been innate in evolutionall along.The human increment accelerates faster than pre-human evo-lution because through the third, semantic circuit and its symbols(words, maps, equations etc.) we are able to pass information(negative entropy: coherence) from generation to generation.World-wide wealth in terms of \"Real Capital\" (plants inoperation, actual known resources etc.) has been doubling everygeneration since economists started collecting statistics in the18th Century.Where does this wealth come from'?

Both are wrong. Land and labor alone, and land, laborand capital together, can't produce new wealth if they are allorganized by a fallacious idea, such as searching for oil where oilis not. The real source of wealth is correct ideas: workable ideas:that is, negative entropy—Information.The origin of these coherent (workable) ideas is the humannervous system. All wealth is created by human beings usingtheir neurons intelligently.A neurotic young man once went to a Zen Master and askedhow he could find peace of mind.\"How can you lack anything,\" the Roshi asked \"when youown the greatest treasure in the universe?\"\"How do I own the greatest treasure in the universe?\" askedthe young man, baffled.\"The place that question comes from is the greatest treasure inthe universe,\" said the Master, being more explicit than iscommon for a Zen teacher.Of course, as a Buddhist, the Master had taken a vow ofpoverty and did not mean exactly what we mean here. But heknew that the brain produces all that we experience—all our painand worry, all our bliss states and ecstasies, all our higher evolu-tionary vistas and trans-time Peak Experiences, etc. It is also \"thegreatest treasure in the universe\" in the most materialistic eco-nomic sense: it creates all the ideas which, socially employed,become wealth: roads, scientific laws, calendars, factories, com-puters, life-saving drugs, medicines, ox-carts, autos, jet planes,spaceships...If you are not alone in the wilderness, lift your eyes from thepage and look about.

As Bateson points out, if we accept any order-ing process as intelligent, then the biosphere is indeed intelligent;but if we save the word \"intelligence\" only for those orderingprocesses that move at the same speed as our brains, then Natureis merely mechanical, not intelligent. To an extra-terrestrial witha different time-sense than ours, this question would not arise atall.)Most of what we perceive in the human environment is madeup of concretized ideas, in the above sense. Look again at ahuman community; you are seeing the historical human mindmanifesting itself.All ideas are not equally good, of course.All manifested ideas (human creations in the biosphere) are,therefore, not equally good.This is why John Ruskin, a century ago, tried to introduce adistinction between wealth and illth. This distinction did notbecome accepted and incorporated into our language becausepeople, at that time, were not ready for it.Wealth, in Ruskin's sense, consists of all those artifacts(concretized ideas) which enhance human life, or life generally.Illth consists of those artifacts which destroy, demean or degradelife. A factory that pollutes the air or water is illth in this sense;so is a bomb, a sword, a pistol, a tank of nerve-gas.The Westward migration of Capital noted by Brooks Adamswas a migration of both wealth and illth.Obviously, under primitive planetary conditions—finite spaceand finite resources—the illth was perceived as necessary toprotect the wealth.

Thepubescent human, like any other rutting animal, lurches about ina state of mating frenzy, every call gasping for the sexual object.Imprint vulnerability is acute, and the first sexual signals toturn on the adolescent nervous system remain fixed for life andforever define the individual's sexual reality.We should not be surprised, therefore, at the various fetishesthat are so easily acquired at these sensitive moments.In fact, we can tell precisely at what period in time a personwas sexually imprinted by noting which fetishes continue to turnhim or her on. Black garters, booze, cool jazz, and crew cutsdefine the sexual signals of one imprint group (generation) justas rigidly as sleeping hags, marijuana, heavy rock and tightjeans define another.As Masters and Johnson have pointed out, most sexual dys-functions are hooked into the nervous system at these adolescentmoments of acute imprint vulnerability; their archetypal case isthat of a male who, about to mate for the first time, in the backseat of a car, was traumatized by a policeman flashing a light onhim and his paramour. The imprint of that ghastly moment washooked for decades: the male remained impotent until reim-printed by Masters and Johnson in their clinic.The choices of heterosexuality or homosexuality, brash prom-iscuity or timid celibacy, etc. are usually imprinted by exactlysimilar accidents at points of imprint vulnerability.

He did not notice the third, semantic circuit—perhaps because as an obsessive Rationalist he was so absorbedin verbal and conceptual programs that they were invisible tohim, as water may be to fishes. Similarly, Jung described the firstcircuit as the sensational faculty, the second as the feelingfaculty, the third as the rational faculty—and skipped the socio-sexual circuit entirely.

The parent is con-cerned not just with acquiring bio-survival tickets for personalnurture, but with acquiring tickets for the young, and for thefuture.Behaviorists tell us wonderful stories about the intricate pat-terns that can be conditioned into experimental animals. See theysay we have, by selective reinforcement, trained this rat so that atthe sound of a bell, he runs up a ladder, presses button A, racesacross a plank and down another ladder, presses button B, dashesacross the cage and waits at the food-slot for his meal to arrive.Lest anybody think this book is written from a perch of supe-riority, consider the similar, but more complex, behavior whichthe author followed for twenty years.

When the alarm woke him, hewould breakfast hurriedly, rush off to catch a bus, ride to asubway, change to the train, ride to an office building, rushthrough the lobby, board an elevator, ride to a certain floor, enteran office, and toil at repetitious (and generally pointless) tasksfor eight hours. This behavior sequence had been shaped, as B.F.Skinner would say, by reinforcement delivered every secondweek in the form of bio-survival tickets (money). These ticketswere necessary to the bio-survival of four dependent children.The reader of this book can probably remember, somewhatdimly, the imprinting and conditioning of each of these circuits.We all began as infants in a one-dimensional world, orallyhooked to Mommy. The further away from Mommy we crawled,the greater was our bio-survival anxiety, and we generallyreturned to Mommy as quickly as possible. The key imprintincidents of this period, together with associated conditioning,determine, concretely, how much we currently exhibit of:ANXIETY  OR SELF-CONFIDENCEROOTEDNESS OR EXPLORATIVENESSDEPENDENCY OR INDEPENDENCEThen, when the DNA sent the appropriate RNA messengermolecules to the glands, endocrine system, etc. a mutation oc-curred. Our gross morphology — our whole body — changed, andour \"minds\" changed in the process. That is, our reality-tunneldilated into two-dimensions, when we rose up and began to walkabout the house, and started learning who we could dominate,who could dominate us, who could be dominated (emotionallybullied) at some times and not at others, etc. We developed outof amorphous bio-survival consciousness into stubborn individ-ual ego. We were imprinted and conditioned with a particularstyle of emotional-territorial \"politics.\"At this stage we were imprinted and conditioned for:"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    139DOMINANCE OR SUBMISSIONSELF-CONFIDENCE OR SELF-DOUBTSTRONG EGO OR WEAK EGOHIGH PACK STATUS OR LOW PACK STATUSGIVING ORDERS OR TAKING ORDERS\"HERRENMORAL\" OR \"SKLAVMORAL\"We were subsequently conditioned to switch between thesereflexes depending on whether the person we were dealing withwas Higher in the pecking order or Lower in the pecking order.(Middle-class people, e.g., Reagan conservatives, John Birchers,etc. will always revere those Higher in the pecking order; and,equally, will always have some reason to persecute—peck at—the poor, who are Lower in the pecking order. Hence, they willsay and even believe, that they are being robbed by the poor onWelfare—who get about 4% of the tax dollar—and never\"notice\" that the military-industrial complex is getting 72% oftheir tax dollar. This is normal mammalian sociobiology.)After this second-circuit reality-tunnel is wired in, the organ-ism molts and mutates again into the verbal stage, and a thirdcircuit style of mentation imprinted. That is, on top of proto-plasmic consciousness and mammalian ego, we acquire humanmind, which is created by and creator of human artifacts andspeech.Feral children, who survived in isolation from human society(artifacts and speech), have .no \"mind\" in the human sense;which is why they are called feral.In the semantic stage of imprint vulnerability we acquireeither:FLUENCY  OR INARTICULATENESSDEXTERITY  OR CLUMSINESS\"GOOD MIND\" OR \"DUMB MIND\"1Why do we say \"dumb\" (mute) for stupid?

THIS HAS NEVER BEEN THE GOAL OF ANY SOCIETYIN THE REAL WORLD. The traditional childrearing methods arequite logical, pragmatic and sound in fulfilling the real purposeof society, which is not to create an ideal person, but to create[CRATE] a semi-robot who mimics the society as closely aspossible—both in its rational and its irrational aspects, both asthe repository of the wisdom of the past and as the sum total ofall the cruelties and stupidities of the past. Very simply, a totallyaware, alert, awakened (unbrainwashed) person would not fitvery well into any of the standard roles society offers; the dam-aged, robotized products of traditional child-rearing do fit intothose slots.1 James Joyce justified anarchism on the grounds that \"the state isconcentric and the individual is eccentric.\""},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    141That is, there is a neuro-sociological \"logic\" to the illogical.Are traditional schools very much like mini-prisons? Do theystifle imagination, cramp the child physically and mentally, andrun on various forms of overt or covert terrorism? Of course, theanswer is an unambiguous yes; but such schools are necessary totrain people for roles in the ordinary office or factory or profes-sion, which are also very much like mini-prisons, stifle imagina-tion, cramp the person physically and mentally and run on terror(threat of loss of bio-survival tickets, in the form of pay-checksor tenure).The permissive movement in child-rearing appeared onlywhen it did, and has succeeded only to a limited extent, becausesociety has always needed and still thinks it needs human robots.Utopian child-rearing will advance further, necessarily, only associety itself evolves out of authoritarianism. That is, as theaccelerated changes now occurring propel us into the most rapidperiod of social evolution in all human history, we will then needcitizens who are not robots, who are creative; who are notdocile, who are innovative; who are not narrow-minded bigots,who are explorers in every sense of the word.Traditional child-rearing began to falter only when societybegan to enter into the present period of accelerated change andtechnological omni-transformation of all traditional values.Failures in communication generally derive from sending amessage to the wrong address. That is, your husband has an egoproblem and you send a message to his mind. Adapting adiagram from Transactional Analysis what has happened is this:"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142   Prometheus RisingThe message is addressed from Circuit I to Circuit IV. Itmeans \"I feel weak; help bolster me up.\" If the answer comesback from Circuit III to Circuit III, \"Well, let's analyze theproblem...\" there has been a Wrong Address.Of course, this example is deliberately untypical, although notimpossible. It is untypical because women traditionally aretrained not to make this kind of mistake—to be \"emotionallysensitive,\" to be \"supportive,\" etc. It is much more likely, statis-tically;, that this kind of Wrong Address will go the other way—husband to wife. That is, the wife signals \"Help!\" and thehusband on Circuit III says, \"Let's analyze the problem...\"We have said that the imprinting of the circuits contains alarge element of accident (within genetic parameters). Society,everywhere, without understanding this theory, understandsenough pragmatically about imprinting processes to attempt toprogram each individual for his or her assigned role. Hence,traditional girl-rearing is different from traditional boy-rearing,so that women will have more Circuit II \"sensitivity.\" AgainWomen's Liberation, like modern child-rearing, arrived onlywhen we were evolutionarily ready or nearly-ready for it. Thetraditional system worked in traditional societies.Similarly, class structure, like the caste structure in an insecthive, works to produce the \"right\" imprints in each class. Thethird circuit of the servile class or proletariat is imprinted chieflyfor manual dexterity, while the same circuit in middle-class orruling-class children is imprinted for verbal, mathematical orother symbol-using skillsDemocracy has been less than a total success—and the intel-lectual's half-shamed cynicism about democracy is justified—tothe extent that traditional society did not need, could not use, andin many ways discouraged the development of high verbal(\"rational\") skills in the majority of the population. That is,concretely, most people are not encouraged to be very smart, andare rather heavily programmed to be comparatively stupid. Suchprogramming is what is needed to fit them into most traditionaljobs. Their bio-survival circuitry works as well as that of mostanimals, their emotional-territorial circuitry is typically primate,and they have little third-circuit \"mind\" to verbalize (rationalize)with. Naturally, they usually vote for the charlatan who can"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    143activate primitive bio-survival fears and territorial (\"patriotic\")pugnacity. The intellectual looks at the dismal results and contin-ues to believe in \"democracy\" only by an act of Blind Faithsimilar to the way beliefs in Catholicism or Communism orsnake-worship are maintained.Again, the traditional system works, for traditional society. Amass made of people who have intense curiosity about whyBeethoven went in for string quartets after the Ninth Symphony,or whether Kant really refuted Hume satisfactorily, or what thelatest quantum theories mean in relation to Determinism andFree Will, is not a mass that will easily be led into dull, dehu-manizing labor at traditional jobs.Why did Adlai Stevenson lose to Ike Eisenhower, GeorgeMcGovern to Tricky Dicky Nixon, etc.? It was the WrongAddress problem again. Stevenson, McGovern and other darlingsof the intelligentsia were speaking to the third circuit, which isnot very highly developed in most domesticated primates yet.Eisenhower in his Fatherly way, and Nixon in his bullying BigBrother way, knew just how to push the right Second-Circuitemotional-territorial buttons to get a mob of primates to followthem. They were genetically programmed alpha males, in etho-logical terms.Similarly, the Moralist (i.e., the Adult Personality who hasimprinted heavy Ethical imperatives on Circuit IV) is often total-ly unable to communicate with the scientist or technologist. TheMoralist may even decide—many already have—that the scien-tist per se is \"inhuman.\" In fact, morals are fairly irrelevant tothe Third Circuit analytical mind, which is the brain function theaverage scientist has imprinted most powerfully. To the thirdcircuit, the only morality is accuracy, the only immorality issloppy thinking.Again, the rise in \"social conscience\" among scientists is hap-pening only when it was evolutionarily necessary that it happen,i.e., after Hiroshima. If it doesn't seem to be happening widelyenough and quickly enough, well, the same can be said—also inerror, I think—about modernizing education and childrearing,about Women's Liberation, about racism, etc. The rebellionagainst all the follies of the past is succeeding, and will continueto succeed, only as we evolve into a society which needs each"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144   Prometheus Risinghuman to function well on all circuits. We are moving with ever-increasing speed, into such a society.What the impatient radical forgets is that many of the\"injustices\" of the traditional primate society were not evenperceived as such by the best minds of 1000 years ago or 100years ago, or in the case of institutionalized sexism, even 30years ago. If we can see injustice and absurdity in many age-oldinstitutions, it is only because we are evolving out of robothood,at precisely the point in evolution when it is necessary for us tobecome smarter and more sensitive on all circuits.Each of us has a \"favorite\" circuit—that is, a circuit that hasbeen more heavily imprinted than the others. Miscommunication,misunderstanding and general misjudgment of one another isvastly increased by the fact that few of us know about theselevels of circuitry, and we all tend to assume that the person weare interacting with is on the same circuit we are.Thus, there are narcissistic (oral) first-circuit types in everysocial group. Present them with a problem and they will imme-diately look for somebody else to handle it, since the oral stage isrobotically imprinted for dependency. (Or, if they have imprintedhostile weakness instead of dependent weakness, they willexplode into anger—infantile tantrum—raging that a problemexists and that it has been imposed on them.)A second-circuit type, in the same situation, will attempt tofrighten the problem away by barking and blustering at it,mammalian-fashion.A third-circuit type will try to reason out the problem. This isthe best approach only with problems that are themselves ratio-nal, i.e., \"How do you make this machine work?\" It can be blind,and futile, when the \"problem\" is another human being actingout one of the more destructive second-circuit rage programs.(\"The liberal is the one who leaves the room when the fightstarts,\" somebody once said. Third-circuit types are most con-fused and feel impotent when second-circuit mammalian politicstakes over the scene.)A fourth-circuit type will try to be rational (third circuit) andto sense the emotional dimensions of the problem (secondcircuit) but will basically try to impose a moral solution: \"Nowthis is the decent, fair thing to do...\" This may or may not make"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   745sense to the third-circuit Rationalist, looking for objectivejustice; and it will usually make no sense at all to the totallysecond-circuit type dominated by emotionalism and territoriality.What is true of the group is true of the individual. While weall have our favorite circuit, and tend to see that circuit as\"superior\" to all the others, we can be pushed out of it by shocksor stresses, in which case we jump to another circuit.The most robotic Rationalist will descend to the first circuit,eventually, if threat to bio-security is forcibly enough presentedon the screen of consciousness. And, if prevented from \"leavingthe room when the fight starts,\" the Rationalist will even descendto second-circuit mammalian howling and barking, under suffi-cient pressure. (Oliver Wendell Holmes referred to this as \"thehydrostatic principle in controversy,\" whereby the fools drageverybody down to their own level.)The most robotic Emotionalist may also move up to the thirdcircuit, temporarily, if a problem remains intractable to everyform of emotional bullying or con-artistry.All of us will move into fourth-circuit Parent role or SuperEgo—even little children will do it, imitatively—if it seems thatthe only way to get what one wants is to appeal to tribal morality:\"Why, it would be positively, indecent not to do it the wayGrandfather would...\"\"Give us the child until he is five, and we will have him forlife,\" bragged some 18th Century Jesuit. The Jesuit order of thattime, as Aldous Huxley later noted sardonically, educatedVoltaire, Diderot, and the Marquis de Sade; obviously their tech-niques of brain-programming were not perfect. Nonetheless,most people in most societies do grow up as fairly accurate repli-cas of the previous generation. Most children educated by theJesuits have remained Catholics. Most children of Democrats donot become Republicans. Etc.Considering the wide variety of philosophies available to anyof us—nudism and Buddhism, scientific materialism and snakeworship, Communism and vegetarianism, subjective Idealismand Existentialism, Methodism and Shinto, etc.—the fact thatmost people remain in the same reality-tunnel as their parents,does indicate that acculturalization is a mind control process.

In the course of the drama camea scene Shea and I had almost forgotten writing in the sevenyears since the books were finished in 1971.

The mindless automatonsobey and each drinks his cyanide cocktail.Shea and I had written that bizarre sequence to illustrate theextremes to which brainwashing can go. We both regarded it asan extravagant fantasy, for satirical purposes—an exaggerationof our serious theme.Yet while the actors on the stage were depicting this \"fantasy\"every TV and newspaper in the land was discussing the exactsame species of mass zombie behavior. Our fictional maniacguru was Adolph Hitler; in November 1978, while our play wasbeing performed, another maniac-guru, Jim Jones, had played thewhole sequence out in reality. In Guyana, he had ordered 900 ofhis robots to drink cyanide and they had all obeyed.It was particularly interesting to me that Jones had staged hisGotterdammerung while our play was having its American"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"/52   Prometheus Risingpremiere. It was even more interesting that the tool of masssuicide, in our fiction and in Jones' reality, had been cyanide.Carl Jung, the psychologist, and Wolfgang Pauli, the physi-cist, had a name for peculiar coincidences of that order of eeri-ness. They called them synchronicities and said they representedan acausal and/or holistic principle in nature that acts outside thelinear past-present-future of Newtonian time.Pauli, like most quantum physicists, was aware that subatomicevents cannot be understood in Newtonian terms and mustrequire some sort of acausality (indeterminism) or holism (super-determinism) to explain them. In either case, the distinctionbetween \"observer\" and \"observed\" breaks down. (About that,more later.)Jung, in turn, had observed that such synchronicities—weirdcoincidences—tend to occur when certain deep structures in thepsyche are activated. He assumed that these structures were atwhat he called \"the psychoid level,\" below the collective uncon-scious, where mind and matter are not yet distinct—the quantumfoam out of which matter and form and consciousness hierarchi-cally emerge.Wait. It gets weirder..; »HEIRESS TO BANK ROBBERWhen Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liber-ation Army on February 4, 1974, she was a \"normal\" youngheiress. She was attending a normal college, had a normal live-inboyfriend and smoked a normal amount of weed for a youngheiress of that time. 57 days later, she had become a new person,with a new name—Tania—and was living in a new reality-tunnel.Where Patty had been heterosexual, Tania was bisexual.Where Patty largely accepted the Hearst family tunnel-realitywith only a few \"liberal\" modifications typical of her age group,Tania was a violent and fanatic revolutionary. Where Patty hadbeen respectful to her parents, Tania denounced them as\"corporate liars\" and castigated them as being involved in acapitalist plot to \"murder\" the poor people of the U.S. \"down tothe last man, woman and child.\" Where Patty had been \"nice\""},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   753and polite and certainly non-violent, Tania had her photo takenholding a tommy-gun and assisted in at least one bank robberyand perhaps other felonies.What had happened? When Patty-Tania was captured andbrought to trial, the defense claimed that she had been\"brainwashed.\" The jury either did not understand or did notbelieve this; they sentenced Patty to prison for the crimes Taniahad committed. Debate about this case continues to the present,since some people think Ms. Hearst was \"responsible\" for theconsciousness change she underwent while held captive by theSLA and others are just as sure she was not \"responsible.\"Leaving metaphysical questions of \"responsibility\" aside for amoment, it seems obvious that a young lady of Hearst's class andbackground would almost certainly not have taken up bankrobbing if she had not first been kidnapped and incorporated bythe SLA.Since the SLA called itself an army, let us compare it to anarmy; this may prove illuminating.One does not get kidnapped into an army the way Hearst gotkidnapped into the SLA, but the process is not entirely dissimi-lar. U.S. Army recruiters do not break into a young man's housein the middle of night with guns, as the SLA did with Patty: theysimply send the young man a notice in the mail. Nonethelesscoercion is there; the young draftee knows that if he ignores theletter, government agents will be around to seize his body in ashort while, (unless he flees the country.) He will then either gointo the army or into jail. Thus, whether we are speaking aboutthe S.L. Army or the U.S. Army, the subject is reduced to infan-tile helplessness: other people are deciding what is to be done tohis or her body. One is pushed to the neonate position of beingone foot high in a six foot tall world, as it were. Like the smallchild, one is learning that the first rule of survival is to obey.Most people (except nudists) are shy about appearing nakedin public—and this is the most common of all nightmares,\"There I was with no clothes on!\" (Joyce made this the centralincident in the dream that is all dreams, Finnegans Wake.) Thefirst step in leaving the civilian reality-tunnel and being initiatedinto the Army reality-tunnel is, thus, the physical examination, inwhich the subject is stripped naked and made to march around a"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Prometheus Risinglarge building with other naked victims while the fully-clothedArmy personnel give the briefest possible orders: \"Stand up. Sitdown. Go there. Come back here,\" etc. The Masonic initiation,which only removes part of the clothing of the subject, is amilder version of the stripping away of previously secure socialparameters.What is really being \"stripped away\" is more subtle; it is thewhole social system in which one has lived before beingsnatched by a U.S. or an S.L. Army. When the doctor tells thenaked draftee, \"Bend over. Spread your cheeks,\" so-callednormal reality has ended as totally as if the victim had beenincorporated into a surrealist movie. If an employer becomes tooobnoxious, one can always find a new job. You cannot walk outon the U.S. or S.L.

Then, one day,after World War I had begun, Ouspensky saw a truck full ofartificial legs. These artificial legs were being sent to the front-line hospitals, for soldiers whose legs had not even been blownoff yet, but whose legs would be blown off. The prediction thatthese legs would be blown off was so certain that the artificiallegs were already on their way to replace the natural legs. Theprediction was based on the mathematical certainty that millionsof young men would march to the front, to be maimed and mur-dered, as mindlessly as cattle marching into a slaughterhouse.In a flash, Ouspensky understood the mechanical nature ofordinary human consciousness.( \"I can 't get out — my horns won 'tfit through the door. \")Initiation into the \"Manson family\" is not dissimilar. LynetteFromme was much like Patty Hearst — a \"normal\" Americanyoung woman, with less money than Hearst, but no specialproclivity for criminal behavior.

What did these four men have in common?As Aleister Crowley points out, \"No point of doctrine, nopoint of ethics, no theory of a 'hereafter' do they share, and yetin the history of their lives we find one identity amid manydiversities.\"Buddha was an ordinary Hindu nobleman, and then heexperienced a rapid brain-change, after which he became a greatTeacher.Mohammed was a humble camel-driver, with no sign ofexceptional intelligence or ambition, and then he experienced a"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156   Prometheus Risingrapid brain change, after which he became Teacher, Conqueror,Law-Maker and Prophet.We hear nothing of Jesus (save a few fables) until the age of30, when he experiences a rapid brain-change, and puts forth adoctrine that is to overturn the Roman Empire and influenceWestern Civilization until the present.St. Paul, who took the teaching of Jesus and turned it into amilitant movement, suffered an extreme form of brain-change, ofwhich he tells us that he was temporarily struck blind and liftedup into the heavens where he beheld things \"of which it is notlawful to speak.\"On all else but the experience of Illumination they disagree.Buddha insisted that his enlightenment was perfectly natural—\"Are you a God?\" he was once asked.\"No.\"\"Are you a saint?\"\"No.\"\"Then what are you?\"\"I am awake.\"Mohammed informs us that he \"spoke\" to the Angel Gabriel,Jesus that the \"Father which is in heaven\" spoke through him,and St. Paul that he saw the lights and wonders above mentioned.Making every possible reservation about fable and myth, weget this one coincidence: A nobody experiences rapid brain-change (consciousness dilation) and abruptly becomes verymuch a historical Somebody. Much of the human race is stillliving on the legacy of these four bio-electrical \"illuminations,\"for good and for ill.Most people (the present author included) would considerwhat happened to Patty Hearst \"bad\" and what happened toBuddha \"good.\" It needs to be emphasized that both the \"bad\"and the \"good\" brain change experiences are functionally thesame.

Paracelsus, for instance, leftbehind some of his sperm with directions to a student on how torevive or recreate him out of it. (He seems to have had a crudeand inaccurate idea of cloning.) In the 1780s, both BenjaminFranklin and Condorcet, in America and France, wrote thatmedical science would eventually conquer death along withevery other disease.The modern immortalist movement began with physicistR.C.W.

They are intendedto ensure that what happens mechanically (\"without thought\")really does serve bio-survival, since the reflexes imprinted acci-dentally on this circuit are not that dependable.The mechanical nature of the bio-survival circuit is of keyimportance in brainwashing. To create a new imprint, reduce thevictim to an infantile state, i.e., first-circuit vulnerability.As pointed out in the last chapter an army begins this processwith the draft notice, which informs the subject that his body nolonger belongs to him but to the government. The S.L. Army,seeking quicker brain change, began the conversion of Patty intoTania by taking her at gun point, but the message was the same:\"We can do what we want with your body from now on.\" First-circuit bio-survival instincts thus become hooked to obeyingthose who have this awesome power—just as the infant learns tohook its bio-survival circuitry to the parental figures.Patty's ride in the trunk of a car (after being taken at gun-point) is a classic rebirth ritual; the trunk is even womb-like in itscontours. When the trunk opened, she was reborn into a newreality-tunnel, that of her captors. Similarly, where the earliestforms of masonic initiation survive and have not been diluted(Note the Adeptus Major Ritual in the Complete Golden DawnSystem of Magic, by Israel Regardie, Falcon Press 1983.) thecandidate is thrown into a well, and then \"raised\" as a newbornFreemason. Total submersion, the form of baptism preferred byProtestant fundamentalists, imitates this, but without the realanxiety that made traditional masonry and the SLA so effectiveas brain change agents.All brainwashers empirically know (without in most casesever having read Leary's eight-circuit model of the brain) thatthe oral bio-survival circuit seeks bonding with a mothering fig-ure. To increase panic and imprint vulnerability, then, thesubject, after being seized by the brainwashers (U.S. or S.L.Army, \"secret police,\" or whoever they may be in a given case)163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"164   Prometheus Risingis isolated from all those to whom bonding had previously beenestablished. The draftee is sent to boot camp and sees no lovedones (wife, girlfriend, parents, etc.) for a number of weeks ormonths. The political prisoner is thrown into a dungeon. PattyHearst was locked in a closet as soon as she was \"rebirthed\" outof the trunk of the car.Experiments in isolation by the U.S. Marine Corps, Dr. JohnLilly and others—and the records of shipwrecked sailors, assummarized by Lilly in Simulations of God—show that only afew hours of pure isolation may be necessary before halluci-nations begin. These hallucinations, like those of psychedelicdrugs, indicate the breaking down of previous imprints and theonset of vulnerability to new imprints.The need to bond the bio-survival circuit to somebody (orsome thing) is indicated by the giraffe who imprinted on thehunter's jeep as a mother-substitute. Similarly, children withoutsiblings, especially those in remote rural areas, often inventimaginary playmates, which can become \"real\" enough tofrighten the parents into suspecting the onset of psychosis. Dr.Lilly's records of sailors and explorers in isolation show thatsuch \"guides,\" \"companions\" or \"holy guardian angels\" reappearquickly even in adulthood when normal social contact isremoved. They also come promptly to those undergoing themysterious state called \"near-death\" or \"out of body experience,\"(e.g., when the heart stops on the operating table.)The first human being who appears to the subject after thisisolation can easily become bonded as the mother-substitute, or,next best, as a father-substitute. This explains why people heldprisoner by terrorists (e.g., on hijacked airplanes) often develop a\"paradoxical\" sympathy for those who are threatening to killthem. It also explains why the draftee begins to look on his kid-nappers as protectors as well as captors, and why the brainwashvictim begins to please, gratify and eventually \"respect\" thebrainwasher.In all cases, since the bio-survival circuit is keyed to nourish-ment, those who bring food become possible subjects for bond-ing. The political prisoner, the draftee, the subject kidnapped byterrorists, all move somewhat closer to identification/bondingwith their captors as they are fed regularly. Again, this is"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    165imitated crudely by various religions (without the terror thatcreates true imprint vulnerability) by following baptism/rebirthrituals with a communal meal or Holy Eucharist.Adaptations of these principles can be applied even to thosewho walk into the brainwashing environment voluntarily at first,as in People's Temple, the Manson Family, and similar organi-zations. The first step, once the victim is inside the territory(commune), is to begin isolation by cutting off all communica-tion with the outer world and its conflicting reality-tunnels.Meanwhile, a parental-protective atmosphere is quickly created(sometimes called \"love-bombing\") and food is provided.Whether the subject has entered voluntarily as in these com-munes, or has been kidnapped or arrested (as in police states),the next stage is to break down the second-circuit emotional-territorial imprints. That means that the subject continues to befed (maintaining first-circuit oral dependence) while the second-circuit ego is attacked in every manner possible. A point-by-point comparison of the techniques of a Synanon \"gamer\" andU.S. Army drill sergeant, for instance, would show astonishingsimilarities, since the basic message is dozens and dozens ofvariations on \"You are all wrong. We are all right. It is extremelyunlikely that somebody as wrong as you will become right, ever,but we will try to teach you.\" The anal vocabulary of territorialstatus is, of course, employed extensively. The ideal subject mayalmost forget his or her name and become conditioned to answer-ing to \"You asshole, come here.\"The sense of bottom dog helplessness can be escalated byperiodic doses of real terror. One of Charlie Manson's famoussayings was \"Fear is the great teacher,\" and every brainwasherwould agree ardently. In communist countries (as dramatized inCosta-Gravas's fine and factual film, The Confession) a favoritetrick is to take the subject out of his cell, march him to a court-yard, place a noose about his neck, and convince him he is aboutto be hanged. The relief, when this turns out to be a bluff, createsideal imprint vulnerability. A variation in my novel Illuminatus!has the victim persuaded he has been poisoned, dumped in a cof-fin and the lid slammed upon him. Those who have been initiatedas Mark Master Freemasons will recognize at once that the sametechnique is the \"mark that you will carry to your grave.\""},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166   Prometheus RisingAmong the Zuni Indians, the male at adolescence is kid-napped by masked \"demons\" who carry him away from the tribe(away from mother and other imprinted security figures.) He isdragged out into the desert and threatened with whips. Then themasks come off, revealing his maternal uncles, and in thatmoment of imprint vulnerability the tribal \"secrets\" (the localreality-tunnel) are explained in a way that leave an indeliblemark on his consciousness. Similar rites of passage are found inall tribes, few as cleverly designed as this one. Symbolic anddiluted versions survive in Bar Mitzvahs and Confirmationceremonies in our local mega-tribes.The rebirthing of the second circuit is (relatively) completewhen the Bottom Dog subject begins to seek, sincerely (nothypocritically) to win the approval of the Top Dogs. This, ofcourse, only begins as play-acting; the skilled brainwasherknows that, and does not really object. With subtle reinforcementthe play-acting becomes more and more genuine. Edmund Burkenoted long ago, and every Method Actor knows, that you cannotmake three dramatic gestures of rage in a political speech, with-out beginning to feel some real rage. You cannot make threegestures of submission without beginning to feel really submis-sive. (This is the psychology of the \"company man,\" who trulyidentifies with his employer after years of obedience.)The draftee first tries to please the sergeant, to avoid furtherhumiliation and punishment. Gradually, he genuinely wants toplease the sergeant, i.e., to prove he is not all wrong and is \"goodenough\" to be a soldier. Patty Hearst undoubtedly pretended toaccept the SLA reality-tunnel at first, and gradually found thepresence becoming more and more real.This process is accelerated by a system of occasional rewards,as the subject more and more often emits (as the Behavioristswould say) the desired behaviors. Since people are more compli-cated than Behaviorists know, it is necessary to vary this withoccasional punishments for \"insincerity,\" or \"backsliding,\" sothat the subject learns that after the initial stage, it is not enoughto pretend to accept the new reality-tunnel; to escape furtherhumiliation, ego-loss, terrorism and permanent Bottom Dogstatus, one must begin to accept it sincere/y. After the imprint ofhelplessness had been made, this conditioning and learning will"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   167proceed fairly smoothly, especially if the Chief Brainwasher'sconfederates reinforce it with encouragement, support, andgeneral \"reward\" (for sincere submission) and contempt, disap-pointment and general rejection (for insincerity or backsliding.)Reimprinting the third semantic circuit can now follow easily.The human brain is capable of mastering any symbol-system ifsufficiently motivated. Some people can even play Beethoven'slate piano music, although to me this is as \"miraculous\" as anyfeat alleged by psychic researchers; people can learn French,Hindustani, differential calculus, Swahili, etc. ad. infinitum—ifmotivated. When the first circuit security needs have beenreimprinted and second-circuit ego-needs have been hooked tomastering a new semantic reality-tunnel, that tunnel will beimprinted.At this point a certain amount of arbitrary nonsense is of greatvalue. That is, the new reality-tunnel or symbol-system (like theold one) should contain pitfalls (gross violations of previous real-ity tunnels and common sense) so that the subject can be accusedof backsliding (being \"all wrong,\" after all) and thereby incitedto try harder to become part of the new reality-tunnel.Thus, Jehovah's Witnesses may not accept blood transfusions,even if their life depends on it: harder still (since all mammalshave an instinct to protect their young) they must reject bloodtransfusions for their children, even if the children die of thisneglect. A Roman Catholic woman may not be divorced even ifher husband comes home drunk every night, beats her up andgives her VD. In the U.S. Marines, a recruit who commits thehideous crime of calling a rifle a \"gun\" must walk around thebase with his rifle in one hand and his penis in the other recitingto everybody he meets, \"This is my rifle/This is my gun/This isfor fighting/This is for fun.\" Theosophists were once required tobelieve that there is a hole at the North Pole going down to thecenter of the earth; Manson required his followers to believe thehole was in the Mojave Desert. Nazi Party members were askedto believe that the lion is an Aryan animal and the rabbit non-Aryan. Etc.The neurological and sociological function of such\"nonsense\" (which makes the Rationalist gasp in shock) is tosharply segregate those within the new reality-tunnel from those"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168   Prometheus Risingoutside. This makes for group solidarity, group-reinforcement,and a strong sense of alienation and discomfort when on rareoccasions it is necessary to talk at all with those outside thebrainwasher's semantic system. The group must ensure, ofcourse, that this alienation is experienced as \"superiority.\" Thosewho are outside the reality-tunnel must be perceived as \"allwrong\"—just as the subject was, before being brainwashed.Drugs can be, and have been, used to fine-tune these process-es, but the general neurological principles are powerful enoughthat it is quite likely that many famous cases of brainwashingwere accomplished as above described, without any drugs atall—e.g., the American soldiers who confessed to war crimeswhich they evidently had not committed, the loyal Communistswho confessed to Trotskyite conspiracies which seemingly neverexisted, etc. It takes very few weeks for most armies, withoutdrugs, to convert a civilian into a soldier, even though the twospecies are as different as Roman Catholics and Shintoists.In one of my Immortal Novels I describe a religious cultcalled Loonies, founded by one Neon Bal Loon, in which mem-bers pray in pig-Latin while standing on one leg like storks. Thisis considered satire, but any would-be messiah who understandsthe above principles could create such a cult easily; and themembers would soon have a quite sincere sense of superiority tothose outside that reality-tunnel.Cults and outlaw terrorists generally follow the above proce-dures by further rewiring of the fourth, socio-sexual circuit.(Governments usually leave that circuit alone, since governmentagents are largely puritanical-authoritarian and afraid to getinvolved at all with raw Eros.) It is no secret that the mostpowerful secret society of the middle ages, the Knights Templar,forced recruits to participate in both blasphemy and sodomy. Justas the deliberate nonsense of all cultish third-circuit semanticsisolates the group from the rest of society, this initiation sepa-rated the Templars from the rest of Christendom; the alienationcould easily be conditioned into a sense of superiority. The Mau-Maus in Kenya also insisted on one act of homosexuality tobreak the new member's previous conditioning toward hetero-sexuality and monogamy. Other cults, some quite well known,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    169attempt to repress sexuality entirely—another way of breakingthe statistically normal imprinting of the fourth circuit.The Manson Family insisted on what might be called, oxymo-ronically, compulsory free love. The Army serves normal ama-tive bonds and casts the subject into a world where compulsorycelibacy alternates with whore-house adventures and, quite often,the rape of enemy women, with homosexuality as an ever-present hidden option. A current American guru, Da Free John,imprints his subjects for lifelong monogamy, almost like theoutside U.S. culture, but is indifferent as to whether these pair-ings are heterosexual or homosexual. Whatever variation thecult-leader may choose, what makes for successful \"separatereality\" is that it be in some respect outlandishly different fromthat of the major society.The easiest way to get brainwashed is to be born. All of theabove principles then immediately go into action, a processwhich social psychologists euphemistically call socialization.The bio-survival circuit automatically hooks onto or bonds to themost appropriate mother or mothering object; the emotional-territorial circuit looks for a \"role\" or ego-identification in thefamily or tribe; the semantic circuit learns to imitate and then usethe local reality-grids (symbol systems); the socio-sexual circuitis imprinted by whatever mating experiences are initially avail-able at puberty.The subjects may not come out of this process ready tomurder women and children, like the graduate of boot camp, oreven willing to believe that Charlie Manson was both Jesus andSatan simultaneously, or willing to spout New Left slogans whilerobbing banks. The subjects come out of normal \"socialization\"depending on where and when they were born as Eskimototemists, Moslem fundamentalists, Roman Catholics, MarxistLeninists, Nazis, Methodist Republicans, Oxford-educated-agnostics, snake worshippers, Ku Kluxers, Mafiosos, Unitarians,IRA-ists, PLO-ists, orthodox Jews, hardshell Baptists, etc. etc.The universe or existence, is obviously large enough andcomplex enough and the ego self-centered enough, that all ofthese reality-tunnels are capable of \"making sense,\" to somedegree, to those imprinted/conditioned to accept them. It is alsoobvious that most of these reality-tunnels contain elements so"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"I JOPrometheus Risingabsurd that everybody not imprinted/conditioned by them looksat them with astonishment and dismay, wondering \"How can arational person (or peoples) believe such rubbish?\"What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves... whether you areliving in a Christian reality-tunnel, a Mansonoid reality-tunnel,an Immortalist reality-tunnel, a vegetarian reality-tunnel, aRationalist reality-tunnel...Everybody has the only true true religion.Earlier, we quoted some words from Persinger and Lafreniere:We, as a species, exist in a world in which exist a myriad ofdata points.

The pattern of thestructure originates within our biological and sociologicalproperties."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    171It is to be hoped that this makes more sense to the reader nowthan it did at the beginning of our enquiry.The function of the domesticated primate brain, insofar as wehave described it up to this point and leaving out the higher,newer circuits, is to serve as an \"organ of adaptation\" in Freud'sphrase. Specifically, the oldest, most primitive, most mechanicalcenters serve simple bio-survival. The more recent (500,000,000year-old, roughly) emotional territorial centers serve to maintainpack identity, habitat-space and hierarchy. The distinctly homi-nid semantic circuit (100,000-year-old?) makes maps andmodels—reality-tunnels—which we tend to confuse with realityitself, and, worse yet, with \"all\" of reality. The (30,000? yearold) moral-social circuit creates the domesticated adult personal-ity, or parent-role, or super-ego.Now, obviously the third, semantic circuit works with and forthese other antique circuits. The maps and models it makes aretools of adaptation, and what they adapt us to is social roles indomesticated primate society. Thus, a Midwestern Methodist isnot \"misusing his brain\" as Arthur Koestler thinks in construct-ing a Midwestern Methodist tunnel-reality; that is precisely whathis brain is for, to adapt him to the Midwestern Methodist tribalsystem—to impose the structure of Midwestern Methodist ideol-ogy upon the myriad of data-points he encounters in his life-time. The Chinese Maoist, the Iranian Moslem, the New YorkFeminist, the Marin County Hedonist, etc. each has a similar,equally arbitrary, equally complex reality-tunnel. Each tunnel isalso equally absurd when seen from outside.The problems of the modern world arise from the fact thatthese reality-tunnels are no longer isolated from each other.Throughout most of human history and up to 100 years ago—upto 20 years ago, in some parts of the world—a man or womancould lead their entire life snugly within the cocoon of the localtunnel-reality. Today, we all constantly collide with personsliving in wildly different tunnel-realities.

Speed of travel and of communica-tion are still continuing to accelerate.Fortunately, higher circuits are forming in the human brainand offer broader vistas than the narrow tunnel-visions of theantique circuits. That is the topic of our concluding chapters.Since everybody \"prefers\" one circuit over the others, thereare people in each society who are easily recognizable as Narcis-sists (first-circuit robots), Emotionalists (second-circuit robots),Rationalists (third-circuit robots) and Moralists (fourth-circuitrobots).Rationalist robots, like the other robots, may be totally mech-anized or may have some slight flexibility, or \"freedom\" builtinto their circuitry. The totally robotized make up the vast hordeof the Fundamentalist wing of the Materialist church and theother True Believers in the scientific paradigms of 1968, 1958,1948 or whenever their nervous systems stopped taking newimprints.These are the people who are perpetually frightened and dis-mayed by the large portion of human behavior mediated throughCircuit II mammalian politics. They think that because this terri-torial-emotional (\"patriotic\") behavior is not Rational, it shouldnot exist. They accept Darwin as dogma, but are nervous about\"Darwinism\" (because it accepts mammalian politics as anEvolutionary Strategy that has worked thus far) and are repulsedby the data of ethology, genetics and sociobiology.

This iswhy it is so often connected with \"intuition,\" which is a way ofthinking between and around data-points on the perceptualscreen—sensing what total field the points must be part of.The great musician has developed a remarkable feedbackbetween fifth-circuit Gestalt-ing and the third-circuit function ofcoding such \"coherent structures\" into the inspired symbolism ofmusic. Music always leads to some right-brain activity in listen-ers, and the fifth circuit is almost certainly located in the rightbrain hemisphere.Beethoven, we remember, was left-handed. Since the lefthand is neurologically linked to the polymorphous right brain,one might say he was genetically inclined to right brain activi-ties, that is, to sensing coherent wholes, to plunging into neuro-somatic bliss almost \"at will,\" and to sensory-sensual raptnessand rapture. Everybody \"knows\" that the Sixth Symphony is\"pantheistic,\" but whether Beethoven was an ideological panthe-ist or not, that way of responding to nature is normal and naturalright-brain Circuit V functioning. That is, anybody on the FifthCircuit will \"talk like a pantheist\" whether or not he has devel-oped a \"philosophy\" about pantheism. The miracle of Beethovenis not that he felt the universe that way—a few thousand fifth-circuit types throughout history have also felt and sensed naturethat way—but that he mastered the third-circuit art of music withsuch skill that he could communicate such experiences, which isprecisely what the ordinary \"mystic\" cannot do.The neurosomatic circuit probably began to appear around30,000 years ago.

How often does a person go to adoctor? If a mind researcher is \"glowing\" rather than greyish,\"bouncy\" rather than craggy, if he or she has a \"sparkle\"—and ifhe or she virtually never goes to a doctor—the neurosomaticcircuit has been mastered.

Mithraism, the Eleusinian cult at Athens, theDionysian cults, etc. all had age-old shamanic techniques forinducing neurosomatic rapture; Christianity (at first) seems tohave been superior in creating neurosomatic control. In St.Paul's metaphor, the \"Old Adam\" (Circuits I-IV) got bleachedout, and the \"New Adam\" (Circuit V) took over as the center ofconsciousness and self-government. In another metaphor, thebody became the flexible clay and the awakened (illuminated)brain became the sculptor.In general, fourth-circuit problems take the form of guilt; \"Icannot do what I am supposed to do.\" Third-circuit problemstake the form of perplexity; \"I cannot understand how I got intothis mess, or how to get out of it, or what is expected of me,\" etc.Second-circuit problems take the form of bullying or cowardice:\"I will force them, or I will surrender and let them force me.\"First-circuit problems take the form of body symptoms: \"I feelrotten all over\" gradually centering in, under enough stress, onone acute disabling symptom.'Fifth-Circuit neurosomatic consciousness bleaches out allthese problems at once. The disappearance of first-circuit\"physical\" illnesses only seems more \"miraculous\" than the tran-scendence of second-circuit emotionalism, third-circuit perplex-ity and fourth-circuit guilt.

The neurosomatic skill of transmuting all experi-ence, so that one is high and happy in a situation where the four-circuited majority would be miserable, is worth learning for thevery simple, egotistic reason that it's more fun to be happy thanto be in agony. It is also socially beneficial, because, as TimLeary often said, \"You can't do good until you feel good.\" Justas misery loves company, the high and happy want everybodyelse to be high and happy. (This first lesson the fifth-circuit adepthas to learn is to control this upsurge of altruism and not make anuisance of oneself by trying to force everybody to be happy...)The Rationalist is even more alarmed by the results of pro-longed fifth-circuit bliss, which includes the ability to heal awide variety of diseases both in oneself and in others. Even thewell documented current research on endorphins—which givesus the beginning of a neuro-chemical explanation of how suchhealings operate—is regarded with discomfort or hostility by themore robotized Rationalists. It all sounds \"metaphysical\" andtherefore it cannot exist.1There is nothing supernatural about the fifth circuit. It merelyappears \"supernatural\" by comparison to the earlier circuits; butthe third circuit, of which the Rationalist is so proud, undoubt-edly appeared \"supernatural\" when it first appeared.

When asleep the candidates are taken to Hassan'sfamous \"Garden of Delights.\" The capsule had released a heavydoes of opium and they were quite thoroughly unconscious andunaware of their surroundings.The garden — of officially known as the \"the Garden ofDelights\" — covered several acres. Here candidates were preparedfor admission to the Order of the Assassins: they were to becomethe most feared and legendary professional killers in history. Buthere also, in this same garden, were prepared candidates foradmission to the Brotherhood of Light, the Illuminati. The candi-dates, in fact, were prepared the same way. They themselvesselected, unknown to themselves, which order they wouldenter — the political Assassins or the mystic Illuminati.Both young men were conveyed into the Garden of Delightsand placed several acres apart from each other. In a short time,the second stage of the time-release capsule began to work;cocaine was released into their bloodstreams, thereby over-whelming the traces of the soporific opium and causing them toawaken full of energy and zest. At the same time, as they woke,hashish also began to be released, so they saw everything withexceptional clarity and all colors were jewel-like, brilliant,divinely beautiful.A group of extremely comely and busty young ladies —imported from the most expensive brothel in Cairo — sat in acircle around each of the young candidates, playing flutes andother delicately sweet musical instruments. \"Welcome toheaven,\" they sang as the awakening men gazed about them inwonder. \"By the magic of the holy Lord Hassan, you haveentered Paradise while still alive.\" And they fed them \"paradiseapples\" (oranges), far sweeter and stranger than the earth-applesthey had known before, and they showed them the animals ofparadise (imported from as far away as Japan, in some cases),"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising    191creatures far more remarkable than those ordinarily seen inAfghanistan.\"This is heaven!\" the first young man exclaimed, in ecstasy.\"Great is Allah, and great is the wise Lord Hassan Sabbah!\"But, twenty acres away, surrounded by similar lovely ladiesand other wonders, the second young man merely gazed abouthim, smiled in contentment, and said nothing.And then, in both cases, the houris of Paradise, as promised inthe Koran, began to dance, and as they danced, they discardedone by one each of their seven veils. As the veils were thrownoff, more and more hashish was released from the capsules andthe young men saw with greater clarity, felt with deeper inten-sity, experienced beauty and sexual joy in a way completelyunknown in their previous earth lives.Then, as each young man sat entranced by the beauty andwonder of Heaven, the houris finished the dance, and nude andsplendid as they were, rushed forward in a bunch, like flowerscast before the wind. And some fell at the candidate's feet andkissed his ankles; some kissed knees or thighs, one sucked raptlyat his penis, others kissed the chest and arms and belly, a fewkissed eyes and mouth and ears. And as he was smothered in thishashish-intensified avalanche of love, the lady working on hispenis sucked and sucked and he climaxed in her mouth as softlyand slowly and blissfully as a single snowflake falling.In a little while, there was no more hashish being released andmore opium began to flow into the bloodstream, the youngcandidates slept again; and in their torpor, they were removedfrom the Garden of Delights and returned to the banquet hall ofthe Lord Hassan.There they awoke.\"Truly,\" the first exclaimed, \"I have seen the glories ofHeaven, as foretold in Al Koran.

I willtrust Hassan i Sabbah and love him and serve him.\"\"You are accepted for the Order of Assassin,\" said Hassansolemnly. \"Go at once to the Green Room to meet your superiorin the order.\"When this candidate had left, Hassan turned to the second,asking, \"And you?\""},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"792   Prometheus Rising\"I have discovered the First Matter, the Medicine of Metals,the Elixir of Life, the Stone of the Philosophers, True Wisdomand Perfect Happiness,\" said he, quoting the alchemical formula.\"And it is inside my own head!\"Hassan i Sabbah grinned broadly. \"Welcome to the Order ofthe Illuminati!\" he said, laughing.Hassan i Sabbah was not the first or last student of the waysin which sexuality can be transmuted into fifth-circuit rapture.Further to the East, there were Tantric schools within Hinduism,Buddhism and Taoism, which taught techniques by whichprolongation of the genital embrace could explode into dramaticbrain-change. In the West, underground cults of Gnostics,Illuminati, alchemists and witches kept similar techniques asclosely guarded secrets, for if the Holy Inquisition ever learnedof such practices the participants would be denounced as devil-worshippers and burned at the stake.In our own time, there has been a revolutionary upsurge ofthese ancient neurological secrets, with an admixture of moremodern techniques.

For instance, in a Finnegans Wake studygroup, we were all convulsed with laughter when noticing that\"Toot and Come Inn\" is not just a parody of American cutesy-piemotel names but another of Joyce's countless puns on Tutankh-amen.

No human architect has yetequaled Her efficiency or Her esthetics in such routine productsas roses, eggs, insect colonies, fish etc.She (or He) can be personified in modern terms as MotherDNA or Father Nucleic Acid. The Rationalist immediatelyobjects that such personification, however inescapable it is to allwho have encountered the Architect directly on this circuit, isillegitimate, because She or He is unconscious.

When we \"moleculize\" it as DNA we are also onlyseeing one cross-section—the most useful cross-section forscientific analysis. That is all that needs to be said, or should besaid, for the \"scientific materialist\" chemicalization of thebiosphere, and it is no contradiction of direct experience of theBeing itself via Circuit VI yogas, biological or chemical. Indeed,the direct experience undoubtedly can and has helped manyscientists get a wider, more holistic view of what is going on inevolution, which they have brought down to Circuit III in betterlinguistic models. Teilhard de Chardin is one, but not the only,example of a scientist whose evolutionary model has beenimproved by such direct Circuit VI experience.For those who have not yet had Circuit VI experience—andmost of humanity will possess the technology to turn on thiscircuit at will, within the next twenty years—this evolutionaryperspective might, possibly, be conveyed by a series of quantumjumps in perspective, thus:The individual can make mistakes, even fatal ones.Consciousness of Circuits I-V is far from infallible; we all getinto messes, and sometimes they kill us.The gene-pool can make mistakes, but less frequently.

(This humming and buzzing iscommon in later UFO stories...)On August 13, there were 18,000 witnesses, who saw, orhallucinated a symphony of weirdities, including flowers fallingout of the sky, another explosion, bright flashes of light on theclouds and on the ground (crimson, pink, yellow and blue) and aluminous globe spinning through the sky, just like a modernUFO.On September 13, there were 30,000 witnesses.

The system of ideas, rumors, myths, hopes etc. clusteredabout the UFO phenomenon may be the most powerful sociolog-ical force for change currently acting upon our society, as Dr.Jacques Vallee recently stressed in an address to a special UnitedNations committee on the UFO mystery.The UFO debate, or quarrel, hinges upon the two categorieswhich we find central to our thesis—the innocent-looking ideasof \"inside\" and \"outside.\" Broadly speaking, the UFO \"skeptics\"are those who claim the UFO is \"inside\" the UFO observer(\"hallucination,\" misidentification, etc.), while the UFO\"believers\" claim the UFO is \"outside\" (objectivity).As the semanticist Alfred Korzybski often warned, when wesplit verbally that which is never split existentially we introducefallacies into our thinking.

The process is repeated until he finally solves theproblem, carrying one donkey on his back and driving the othernine before him.The \"disappearing donkey\" trick is the epitome of ideas aboutideas about ideas, paintings of paintings of paintings, etc. Thedisappearing donkey is a synecdoche of the meta-programmingcircuit of the nervous system.The meta-programming circuit—known as the \"soul\" inGnosticism, the \"no-mind\" (wu-hsin) in China, the White Lightof the Void in Tibetan Buddhism, Shiva-darshana in Hinduism,the True Intellectual Center in Gurdjieff—simply represents thebrain becoming aware of itself. The artist seeing himself in hispainting, seeing himself seeing himself in his painting... In theZen metaphor, it is a mirror that reflects anything, but does nothold onto anything. It is a conscious mirror that knows it canalways reflect something else by changing its angle of reflection.This is analyzed mathematically in G. Spencer Brown's Lawsof Form; an analog, using not Brown's math but Godel's, andemploying illustrations from the music of Bach and the paintingsof Escher, is Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach.Most of the occult literature of the world—aside from the95% of it that is sheer rubbish—consists of tricks, gimmicks andgames (which the Hindus call upaya, \"clever ways\") to triggermeta-programming consciousness. This generally means leadingthe student \"all around Robin Hood's barn\" as many times as arenecessary, until the poor victim discovers that he has created thebarn himself.For instance, a popular game with California occultists—I donot know its inventor—involves a Magic Room, much like thePleasure Dome discussed earlier except that this Magic Roomcontains an Omniscient Computer.To play this game, you simply \"astrally project\" into theMagic Room.

It is so built that it responds imme-diately to human brain-waves, \"reading\" them and decoding theirmeaning. (Crude prototypes of such computers already exist.)So, when you are in this magic room, you can ask this Computeranything, just by thinking of what you want to know. It will readyour thought, and project into your brain, by a laser ray, thecorrect answer.There is one slight problem. The computer is very sensitive toall brain-waves. If you have any doubts, it registers them asnegative commands, meaning \"Do not answer my question.\" So,the way to use it is to start simply, with \"easy\" questions. Ask itto dig out of the archives the name of your second-grade teacher.(Almost everybody remembers the name of their first gradeteacher—imprint vulnerability again—but that of the secondgrade teacher tends to get lost.)When the computer has dug out the name of your secondgrade teacher, try it on a harder question, but not one that is toohard. It is very easy to sabotage this machine, but you don't wantto sabotage it during these experiments. You want to see howwell it can be made to perform.It is wise to ask only one question at a time, since it requiresconcentration to keep this magic computer real on the field ofyour perception. Do not exhaust your capacities for imaginationand visualization on your first trial runs.After a few trivial experiments of the second-grade-teachervariety, you can try more interesting programs. Take a persontoward whom you have negative feelings, such as anger, disap-pointment, feeling-of-betrayal, jealousy or whatever interfereswith the smooth, tranquil operation of your own bio-computer.Ask the Magic Computer to explain that other person to you; totranslate you into their reality-tunnel long enough for you to"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222   Prometheus Risingunderstand how events seem to them.

For instance, earlyexperiments with this computer can very profitably turn onasking it to explain some of the propositions in this book whichmay seem inexplicable or perversely wrong-headed to you, suchas \"We are all greater artists than we realize\" or \"What theThinker thinks, the Prover proves\" or \"mind and its contents arefunctionally identical.\"This computer is much more powerful and scientificallyadvanced than the rapture-machine in the neurosomatic circuit. Ithas total access to all the earlier, primitive circuits, and overrulesany of them. That is, if you put a meta-programming instructioninto this computer; it will relay it downward to the old circuitsand cancel contradictory programs left over from the past.

My mind abounds with beauty and power.5.1 like people, and people like me.Remember that this computer is only a few decades ahead ofpresent technology, so it cannot \"understand\" your commands ifyou harbor any doubts about them.

Korzybski even claimed that the use of mathematical scriptsis an aid to developing this circuit, for as soon as you think ofyour mind as mind1, and the mind which contemplates that mindas mind2 and the mind which contemplates mind2 contemplatingmind1 as mind3, you are well on your way to meta-programmingawareness. Alice in Wonderland is a masterful guide to the meta-programming circuit (written by one of the founders of mathe-matical logic) and Aleister Crowley soberly urged its study uponall students of yoga.R. Buckminster Fuller illustrates the meta-programming cir-cuit, in his lectures, by pointing out that we feel puny in compar-ison to the size of the universe, but only our bodies (hardware)are puny. Our minds, he says—by which he means our soft-ware—contain the universe, by the act of comprehending it.The seventh, meta-programming circuit is the most recent inevolutionary time and seems to be located in the frontal lobes.That is why the traditional Hindu exercize to activate it is to fixthe consciousness in the front of the forehead and hold it there,hour after hour, day after day, year after year, until the metapro-grammer awakes and you begin to perceive-create infinite reali-ties where before there was only one static jail-cell \"reality\" inwhich you were trapped.As said above, this circuit is the \"soul\" of the Gnostics, asdistinct from the self. The self seems to be fixed and firm, but isnot; that is, whatever circuit you are operating on at the momentis your \"self at that moment.

But if you are sexually attracted to somebody, you go toCircuit IV and that is your \"self until you are orgasmicallysatisfied (or hopelessly frustrated). Most of the preliminary exer-cizes in Sufi and Gurdjieff schools consist in making you awarethat the \"self is not constant but shifts back and forth betweenthe imprints on the various circuits.The \"soul\" or Circuit VII is constant, because it is, as theChinese say, void or no-form. It plays all the roles you play—oral dependent, emotional tyrant, cool rationalist, romanticseducer, neurosomatic healer, neurogenetic Evolutionary Vision-ary—but it is none of them. It is plastic. It is no-form, because itis all forms. It is the \"creative Void\" of the Taoists.If this begins to sound like nonsense, that is inevitable on thislevel. As Lewis Morgan notes, in books on linguistics therealways comes a point at which the prose itself becomes wildlyincomprehensible, disintegrating into nonsense.The same happens, Morgan notes, beyond a certain point inmodern mathematics:Godel's Theorem was once explained to me by a patient, agentle mathematician, and just as I was taking it all in,nodding appreciatively at'the beauty of the whole idea.. .it allturned into nonsense inside my head.It happens in both linguistics and mathematics, because ithappens in consciousness itself, language and math are justmodels of consciousness.\"Mind\" is a tool invented by the universe to see itself; but itcan never see all of itself, for much the same reason that youcan't see your own back (without mirrors). Or as Alan Wattsliked to say, because the tongue ultimately cannot taste thetongue.Ideas about ideas—mathematics about mathematics (Godel)—language about language—consciousness of consciousness—the whole seventh circuit brings us into what Hofstadter callsStrange Loops. Like the legendary ko-ko bird, we follow ourown tail around in ever-narrowing circles, but unlike that mythicbird we never complete the process by flying up our ownrectums and disappearing. It just seems like we're about to self-destruct in that colorful way, and we decide that what we havebeen reading, or thinking, or perceiving, must be \"nonsense.\""},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising225It is not nonsense. We are merely confronting infinity wherewe least expected to encounter it—in our own lonely selves.Physics joined linguistics, mathematics and psychology in thismete programming hall of mirrors when Schrodinger demon-strated that quantum events are not \"objective\" in the Newtoniansense. For fifty years since then, physicists have been strugglingto build a system that will get them out of this Strange Loop. Theresults have been as funny as a Zen koan.For instance, Niels Bohr proposed the Copenhagen Interpre-tation, which merely says, in the manner of Godel, that ourequations do not describe the universe really. They describe themental processes we have to put ourselves through to describethe universe. True enough—and this whole book is a Copen-hagen Interpretation of psychology and owes everything to Dr.Bohr, but we are still in a Strange Loop, and most physicistswant to get out.Dr. John von Neumann proved that there was no way out.This is technically known as Von Neumann's Catastrophe of theInfinite Regress, and it merely shows that any device that willget us out of the first Strange Loop (the Copenhagen collapse ofobjectivity) will just lead us into a second Strange Loop; and anyway out of that will lead to an inexorable third Strange Loop;and so on, forever.Everybody is still trying to refute von Neumann; but nobodyhas been successful.\"I can't get out—my horns won't fit through the door.The meta-programming circuit is not a trap. As Joyce wouldsay, it only looks as like it as damn it. Simply accept that theuniverse is so structured that it can see itself, and that this self-reflexive arc is built into our frontal lobes, so that consciousnesscontains an infinite regress, and all we can do is make models ofourselves making models...Well, at that point, the only thing to do is relax and enjoy theshow.This is what the Hindus call Shiva-darshana, or the divinedance.

Let me then try not to think that I am notgoing to think of you.\"Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead attempted toresolve all such conundrums with a mathematical propositionknown as the Theory of Types. Unfortunately, it was quicklypointed out that either (a) the Theory of Types refers to itself, inwhich case it limits itself by its own terms, and does not solve allour semantic problems, or (b) the Theory of Types does not referto itself, in which case there are propositions to which it does notrefer, and it is again limited, and we are left with our problems.These third-circuit perplexities are of more than technicallogical and philosophical import.

Com-munication between non-equals is warped and distorted bysecond-circuit Domination and Submission rituals perpetu-ating communication jam and a Game Without End.Political power, as a typical alpha male once said, grows outof the barrel of a gun. This is metaphorically as well as literallytrue. The \"gun\" may be symbolic and fairly abstract, consistingof ritualized social expectations (\"Don't talk back to yourfather\") or concrete in a non-violent but deadly way, e.g., thecapacity to remove bio-survival necessities by cutting off theticket supply in a Capitalist society (\"One more word and I'll fireyou, Bumstead!\").Under the primate second-circuit socio-biological rules,everybody tends to lie a little, to flatter or to evade displeasure,when exchanging signals with those above them in the pack-hierarchy.Every authoritarian structure can be visualized as a pyramidwith an eye on the top. This is the typical flow-chart of anygovernment, any corporation, any Army, any bureaucracy, anymammalian pack. On each rung, participants bear a burden ofnescience in relation to those above them. That is, they must bevery, very careful that the natural sensory activities of beingconscious organisms—the acts of seeing, hearing, smelling,drawing inferences from perception, etc.—are in accord with thereality-tunnel of those above them. This is absolutely vital; packstatus (and \"job security\") depends on it. It is much lessimportant—a luxury that can easily be discarded—that theseperceptions be in accord with objective fact.For instance, in the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, the agent hadto develop a capacity to see godless communists everywhere.Any agent whose perceptions indicated that there were actually241"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"242   Prometheus Risingvery few godless communists in this country at that time wouldexperience cognitive dissonance—his or her reality-tunnel was atvariance with the \"official\" reality-tunnel of the pyramid. To talkabout such perceptions at all would be to invite suspicions ofeccentricity, intellectual wiseacreing or of being oneself agodless communist.The same would apply to a Dominican inquisitor in the mid-dle ages who lacked the capacity to \"see\" witches everywhere. Insuch authoritarian situations, it is important to see what the TopDogs (alpha males) see; it is inconvenient, and possibly danger-ous to see what is objectively happening.But this leads to an equal and opposite burden of omniscienceupon those at the top, in the eye of the pyramid. All that isforbidden to those at the bottom—the conscious activities ofperception and evaluation—is demanded of the Power Elite, themaster class. They must attempt to do the seeing, hearing,smelling, etc. and all the thinking and evaluating for the wholepyramid.But a man with a gun (the power to punish) is told only whatthe target thinks will not cause him to pull the trigger (write thepink slip, order the court-martial). The elite, with their burden ofomniscience, face the underlings, with their burden of nescience,and receive only the feedback consistent with their own precon-ceived notions and reality-tunnels. The burden of omnisciencebecomes, over time, another and more complex burden ofnescience. Nobody really knows anything anymore, or if they do,they are careful to hide the fact. The burden of nesciencebecomes omnipresent. More and more of sensory experiencebecomes unspeakable.As Paul Watzlawick notes, that which is objectively repressed(unspeakable) soon becomes subjectively repressed (unthink-able). Nobody likes to feel like a coward and a liar constantly. Itis easier to cease to notice where the official tunnel-realitydiffers from existential fact. Thus SNAFU accelerates and rigidi-tus bureaucraticus sets in—the last stage before all brain activityceases and the pyramid is clinically dead as an intellectual entity.We also propose that \"national security\" is another semanticspook, an Empedoclean knot; that the search for national security"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising243is the chief cause of national insecurity and a potent anti-intelli-gence mechanism.As Leary writes:Secrecy is the original sin.

He would have defied a few people. He would havescared them to death. He had a file on everybody.

Persinger and Lafreniere alsosuggest that the geophysical forces at work create both realoddities (jumping furniture, etc.) and hallucinations, so that it is ajob of nice and exquisite discrimination to attempt to find outwhat was really going on.It has also been proposed, by the learned Dr. Jacques Vallee,astronomer, cyberneticist and physicist, that the UFO phenome-non is being created by a secret police agency as an elaborate\"cover\" for a complex disinformation system.A combined Wilson-Persinger-Lafreniere-Vallee theory,probably fitting more of the data than the separate theories,would suggest that the UFO phenomenon is the synergetic prod-uct of some geophysical oddity which created weird energy fluc-tuations and brain-change experiences in humans on the scene,and is being manipulated after the fact by one or more\"intelligence\" agencies, or by groups even more esoteric.Consider this scenario:Something weird happens.

How coer-cive do we have to be to intimidate witnesses? Most people, asour Snafu Principle explains, are easily led to reporting what anAuthority Figure wants to hear.But let us consider the UFO syndrome further, as illustratingthe whole spectrum of brain-change, and brain-programming.UFO contactees frequently show positive neurosomatic turnon, the bliss-out experience; some even become faith-healers orleaders of occultist groups. Others show negative neurosomaticeffects—light is unbearable, 'as in schizophrenia, anxiety attacksmay require hospitalization, etc.Meta-programming consciousness (the ability to choosebetween alternative reality-tunnels) is also reported, in crudemetaphors about \"parallel universes,\" \"other realities,\" occultishjargon.Neurogenetic (Jungian \"collective unconscious\") visions arecommon, ranging from demons, hairy dwarfs etc. to the SpaceGoddess or Lady of the Stars of ancient and Catholic iconog-raphy.Even meta-physiological (quantum-level) experience isreported in the UFO literature, ranging from trans-time trips and\"out-of-body experiences\" to seeming, or alleged, teleportations.It must be emphasized most strongly that both positive andnegative visions on all these circuits are common in UFOlogy.

The Hearst case would more appropriately be con-sidered a bar near the end of the second movement of the MindWar symphony. The first movement was the primitive neuro-science of ancient and medieval tyrants who acquired a greatdeal of pragmatic know-how about the effects of isolation, terrorand intimidation; and of shamans and occultists who learned howneuro-chemicals can alter perceived reality-tunnels. The secondmovement began with modern psychology, with Freud, Pavlov,Jung, Skinner etc., climaxing with the LSD revolution and thediscovery by millions that reality-tunnels could be radicallymutated—temporarily and sometimes permanently—by neuro-chemistry.The third movement is the growingly obvious warfarebetween those who would program all of us, and those of us whowish to become our own Metaprogrammers.EXERCIZES1.

It would be more accurate to referto these \"waves\" as quantum jumps in energy-coherence level.The First Wave, Toffler says, took millennia to occur, but itfinally transformed the larger part of humanity from the tribalstage (simple hunting-gathering primates) to the stage of large-scale agricultural-feudal civilizations.The Second Wave came much faster and, in a few centuries,transformed almost all of humanity from feudal-agriculturalcottage economy to industrial-urban-market economy.The Third Wave, Toffler says, continues the trend towardacceleration and will happen in only a few decades. We call it\"the information explosion,\" \"the post industrial economy,\" etc.Each wave is faster, by a factor of 10, than the previous wave.And each wave is more total in that it changes more people,changes them more completely, and in the process transformsour concept of human nature and human society.Each wave that Toffler describes can be considered a newquantum state, with energy levels and reality-dimensions lackingin the previous state and totally unpredictable from the previousstate.The First Wave mutated tribal men and women into serfs (orinto Lords and Ladies). It created a whole new social manifoldthat is so subtle and pervasive that anthropologists and sociolo-gists can spend years studying its invisible aspects. And yet thistransformation is so enormous that it is also visible to the mostuntrained eyes: you can't confuse a tribal human with a feudalhuman anymore than you can confuse a dog with a donkey.So, too, the Second Wave created what Toffler wittily calls\"indust-reality,\" manifesting as industrial men and women whoare visibly, tangibly, as different from feudal or tribal humans asdolphins are from rose bushes or armadillos.The Third Wave, which began when Shannon and Wienerdefined information and Von Neumann designed the first pro-grammable computer, is well under way already. Home comput-ers became as common as TV sets by the mid-1980s. Now theNet—computers \"talking to\" computers—is doubling every fourmonths.

In this sense, the factory was thesynecdoche of the Second Wave. It was not merely the agent bywhich \"indust-reality\" spread across the world and multipliedour collective wealth (and illth); it also became the model foreverything else. Our schools are mini-factories or models offactories because their main job was, when they were founded, toprepare people for factory work.

Similarly, offices were modeledon factories, and kept factory-hours, even when this had little ornothing to do with how ,.the offices could most efficiently bemanaged. And in general, \"indust-reality,\" the reality of theindustrial age, moved everybody into the robot lockstep of thefactory system.l\"Indust-reality\" is still so pervasive that it is, as McLuhannoted, mostly invisible. For instance, the feudal age neverprogressed beyond chamber music—trios, quartets etc. Themodern symphony, with its huge orchestra, its Prometheanthemes, its god-like conductor (\"capitalist\"), its concert-master(foreman), its string section moving in harmony with its brasssection, etc. is a beautiful artistic expression of modes of massA free-lance writer can obviously work any hours, but the verysuccessful (and very excellent) John D.

However much this may painsocialists, it was inevitable in a domesticated primate species. Afew alpha males can always see their own advantage moreclearly than the majority can see their collective interest.Nonetheless, as indust-reality has spread, socialism hasfollowed in its wake. Whether the reader likes this or not (andthe author, being up-front about his prejudices, admits that hedoes not like it), this also is inevitable.

The more complex the system, thegreater is its instability. Prigogine demonstrated this mathemati-cally, but in everyday terms, what he means is that, for instance,it is easier to lead two children through a department store thantwenty children. Or: A toothpick \"house\" of 101 pieces is lessstable than a smaller toothpick \"house\" of 10 pieces.Instability is not always bad: in fact, it is absolutely necessaryfor evolution to occur. Inse'ct societies are highly stable and havenot evolved at all in several million years. Human societies arehighly unstable and are in continuous evolution.Prigogine demonstrates the evolutionary value of instabilityby his concept of the \" dissipative structure. \"A dissipative structure is highly complex and therefore highlyunstable. The more complex it is, the more unstable it is, mathe-matically, certain/v; and the more unstable, the more likely it isto change — to evolve.All dissipative structures are teetering, perpetually, betweenself-destruction and re-organization on a higher level of infor-mation (coherence).If that sounds grim, it isn't really. Prigogine's math is highlyoptimistic, He shows that the more complex structures — such asour world-round human society today, midway between SecondWave indust-reality and the emerging Third Wave — are mathe-matically more likely, much more likely, to \"dissipate\" intohigher coherence than into self-destruction."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   259In other words, in the intellectual conflict between Utopiansand Dystopians, the mathematical odds actually are on the sideof Utopians.

He madethat information pool one unit in our fund of knowledge.It took until 1500 AD, Anderla discovered, for the accumula-tion of bits of information to add up to two units in our \"fund.\"It required only 250 years more (to 1750) for our bank ofknowledge to double again, to four units.The next doubling took 150 years and by 1900 humanity had8 units in its information capital account.The next doubling took only 50 years and by 1950 we had 16units."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"262   Prometheus RisingThe next doubling took only 10 years and by 1960 we had 32units.The next doubling took seven years and by 1967 we had 64units.

The model-maker or metaprogrammer is bigger than the model or program.In what are called \"out of body experiences\" (OOBEs) byparapsychologists, awareness seems to escape the confines of thenervous system entirely.Such experiences are routinely triggered by advanced yogapractice, and they also occur spontaneously during what is called\"near-death\" or \"clinical death\" in which the patient appears todie, by all medical standards, but is revived by modern resuscita-tion techniques.OOBEs also occur with heavy does of LSD and with keta-mine, an anesthetic with strange psychedelic side-effects. Theyare also reported in shamanic traditions all over the world and bymany \"occultists\" in our own society.Example: One day in 1973, during a neuro-programmingexperiment, I \"saw\" something happening to my son at exactlythat time in Arizona, over 500 miles away.We can process this datum in various ways. We can say thatmy \"astral body\" actually traveled to Arizona; this is the occultisttheory. We can more conservatively say that I developed extra-sensory perception and \"saw\" Arizona without \"going\" there;there are many parapsychologists who prefer this third-circuitmap of the Sth-Circuit experience. We can try to aver that I only\"happened\" to think of that scene while it was happening, bysynchronicity; this is the Jungian approach. Or we can sweep itunder the carpet by muttering \"mere coincidence\" or \"sheercoincidence;\" which is the traditional Rationalist approach.267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"268   Prometheus RisingWe prefer to say, in accord with earlier writings of TimothyLeary and the present author and the speculations of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group in San Francisco that such casesillustrate a special working of what is called in quantum mechan-ics Bell's Theorem.Bell's Theorem is highly technical, but in ordinary language itamounts to something like this: There are no isolated systems:every particle in the universe is in \"instantaneous\" (faster-than-light) communication with every other particle. The WholeSystem, even the parts that are separated by cosmic distances,functions as a Whole System.Now, such faster-than-light communication seems to beforbidden by Special Relativity, which makes a problem. Bell'sTheorem, however, is inescapable: a theorem in physics is not amere \"theory\"; it is a mathematical demonstration which must betrue, if the mathematics contains no flaw, and if the experimentson which it is based are replicable. Bell's Theorem contains nomathematical flaw, and the experiments are replicable and havebeen replicated several times.And yet we cannot dispense with Special Relativity either,because the mathematics there is equally flawless and the exper-iments are legion that confirm it.Two solutions have been proposed and both assume that the\"communication\" involved in Bellian transmissions does notinvolve energy, since it is energy that cannot move faster thanlight. Dr. Edward Harris Walker suggests that what does movefaster than light, and holds the Whole System together, is \"con-sciousness.\" We may eventually be forced to accept this, inwhich case physics will have justified pantheism or at least pan-psychism. The other alternative, proposed by Dr. Jack Sarfatti, isthat the medium of Bellian transmissions is information.Pure information, in the mathematical sense, does not requireenergy; it is that which orders energy. It is the negative ofentropy, that which brings disorder to energy systems.Dr. Sarfatti explains his theory as follows:Imagine that your brain is a computer, as modern neurologysuggests. Now imagine that the whole universe is a big com-puter, a mega-computer, as John Lilly has proposed.

Esfandiary, Upwingers271"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"According to Patanjali, there are seven \"limbs\" to yoga, or as wewould say seven steps or stages.First is asana, which consists of holding a single posture(usually sitting) for prolonged periods of time. This is anattempt, in our terminology, to stabilize the bio-survival circuitby drowning it in monotony. You sit, and sit, and sit, and sit.Eventually, an \"internal peace\" is reached, which signifies theatrophying of all background levels of \"unconscious\" or unno-ticed bio-survival anxiety.In other schools, since asana is so monotonous and slow-working and because war (second-circuit mammalian strugglesover territory) so common among domesticated primates, analternative method of stabilizing the bio-survival circuit is used:martial arts. Akido, judo, karate etc. all emerged from yoga-likemystic schools, as bio-survival reprogrammers.The second step in classical yoga, according to Patanjali, ispranayama. We have already commented on the efficiency ofthis breathing technique in quieting and mellowing-out second-circuit emotional programs.(It will already be seen that yoga, like brainwashing, beginsfrom the bottom up, working on the more primitive and oldercircuits first.)The third step in yoga is dharana or mantra. Dharana con-sists of concentrating on a single image, such as a vividly imag-ined red triangle, and ruthlessly pushing aside any other images,verbalizations or impressions that cross the mind's screen. Inpractice, this is beyond the powers of most students, so themajority of yoga teachers substitute mantra, which is concentra-tion (by repetition) on a single sentence, usually nonsensical,such as \"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna HareHare\" or \"Aum Tat Sat Aum\" or whatever.Either practice, dharana or mantra, stops the third-circuit\"internal monologue,\" if persisted in for long enough periodseach day.The Western mystical equivalent is Cabala, the most compli-cated \"Jewish joke\" ever invented. Briefly, Cabala exhausts thethird, semantic circuit by setting it to solve intractable numero-logical and verbal problems. The Far Eastern equivalent is theZen Koan, which serves the same function in a less maniacallysystematic way than Cabala, e.g., \"What is the sound of one hand273"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"2J4   Prometheus Risingclapping?\" Zen koans are always combined with zazen (sittingZen), which combines the first-circuit-clearing asana with sec-ond-circuit-mellowing breath-counting (a weaker pranayama).When the student has acquired sufficient detachment fromfirst-circuit anxieties, second-circuit emotions and third-circuitreality-maps, by way of asana, pranayama and dharana ormantra, Patanjali recommends the practice of yama. Thisincludes, but is not limited to, celibacy. The ultimate of yama isto lose all interest in both the social and sexual aspects of thefourth circuit; to cease to care at all about family, tribal or soci-etal matters. This is accomplished by self-denial, which is easierfor those skilled in asana, pranayama and dharana, but stillrequires intense determination.Some take a short-cut at this point, discovered after Patanjalior not known to him, by having themselves locked up in caves.Such isolation, as indicated earlier, helps vastly in bleaching outall four hominid circuits.An alternative, for those not attracted to either celibacy orbecoming hermits, is Tantra, invented in northern India aroundthe time of Patanjali. This simply transmutes the fourth circuit byceremonial, physiological arid \"magick\" (self-hypnotic) explo-sion of the (prolonged) sexual act into fifth-circuit neurosomaticrapture.For those following the orthodox path of Patanjali, the fifthcircuit is imprinted by niyama, which signifies \"super-control\" or\"no-control,\" being the paradoxical state of being spontaneousdeliberately. You cannot be taught niyama; you can only learn itby personal experience. We hypothesize that the bio-energieshave to discharge somewhere, and then when one has driventhem out of the first circuit by asana, out of the second circuit bypranayama, out of the third circuit by dharana or mantra, andout of the fourth circuit by yama, they are driven explosivelyupward into fifth-circuit neurosomatic illumination.The sixth step in yoga, according to Patanjali, is dhyana,which means \"meditation\" only in the roughest way. Dhyanameans actually union with the object on the mind's screen, i.e.,realization of the total meaning of the proposition that mind andits contents are functionally identical, i.e., opening the meta-programming circuit. One can make dhyana on anything; yogis"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising275talk of making dhyana on a tree or a dog, just as don Juan Matus,the Mexican shaman, talks of becoming one with a coyote or astar in the books of Castaneda.The seventh step in yoga is Samadhi, from sam, (union;cognate of Greek syn) and Adhis, the Lord (cognate, HebrewAdonai, Greek Adonis). Here Patanjali and his successors are inviolent dispute, some claiming there is only one Samadhi, othersclaiming two or three or many. Since this corresponds with theopening and imprinting of the neurogenetic circuit, we must optfor the opinion that there are many Samadhi, depending onwhich or how many of the Godly archetypes of the geneticarchives are imprinted. Catholic mystics make Samadhi on theVirgin, Sufis on Allah, Aleister Crowley on Pan, etc.; and, aboveall this, the eighth circuit cosmic information network can alsobe imprinted, making union not just with all sentient beings andsome emblematic archetype of the DNA master program, butwith the inorganic universe as well. It was from this second orderor meta-physiological Samadhi that Gandhi said, \"God is in therock, too—in the rock!\" and pantheists of all sorts, in all tradi-tions, emphatically agree with Canadian psychiatrist, R.M.Bucke who said after his own Eighth-Circuit Samadhi that theuniverse \"is not a dead machine but a living presence.\"This planet is, to put the matter baldly, populated and largelycontrolled by domesticated primates who are not in all respectsreasonable men and women. Voltaire may have been exaggerat-ing when he said that to understand the mathematical meaning ofinfinity, consider the extent of human stupidity; but the situationis almost that bad. Millions have been murdered by stupid lead-ers or stupid mobs, for stupid reasons, in every century; and thebizarre (accidentally imprinted) reality-tunnels which make thispossible continue to rule us and robotize us.Nor is stupidity the exclusive possession of one group oranother; you do not need a \"vocation\" for it as you do for thepriesthood. It seems to be a contagious socio-semantic distur-bance which afflicts all of us at one time or another. Notoriousexamples can be found in the lives of the great. As we have al-ready mentioned an exact measurement of the extent of stupidityamong the learned is provided by the fact that every scientificrevolution takes one generation. Elderly scientists hardly ever"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"2j6   Prometheus Risingaccept a new theory, however good it is, and the revolution isonly completed when a second generation, free of the old im-prints, with vulnerable neurons, imprints the new reality-map.But if science, the paradigm of rationality, is infested withenough stupidity to cause this general one-generation time-lag,what can we say of politics, economics and religion? Time-lagsof thousands of years seem to be \"normal\" in these areas. Indeed,it was through contemplation of religious history that Voltairewas led to his conclusion that human stupidity approximates tothe infinite. The study of politics is hardly more inspiring. Let usjust summarize the matter by saying that stupidity has murderedand imprisoned more geniuses (and more ordinary people),burned more books, slaughtered more populations, and blockedprogress more effectively than any other force in history.It may be no exaggeration to say that stupidity has killed morepeople than all the diseases known to medicine and psychiatry.Intelligence is the capacity to receive, decode and transmitinformation efficiently. Stupidity is blockage of this process atany point. Bigotry, ideologies etc. block the ability to receive;robotic reality-tunnels block the ability to decode or integratenew signals; censorship blocks transmission.If intelligence could be increased, obviously solutions couldbe found more quickly to the various Doomsday scenariosthreatening us.If each scientist working on the energy-resources problemcould double or triple his or her intelligence, work that wouldrequire 20 years might be done in six.If human stupidity in general decreased, there would be lessopposition to original thinking and new approaches to our oldproblems, less censorship and less bigotry.If stupidity decreased, less money would be wasted on vastorganized imbecilities such as the Arms Race, and more wouldbe available for life enhancing projects.There is nothing rationally desirable that cannot be achievedsooner if rationality itself increases.

This is what meta-program-ming (cybernetic) consciousness means.Why be depressed when you can be happy, dumb when youcan be smart, agitated when you can be tranquil? Obviously,most people are depressed, dumb and agitated most of the timebecause they lack the tools to repair and correct damaged, defec-tive circuits in their nervous system. We are acquiring the tools,and this Intelligence Intensification has the Pleasure Principle tofuel it. That is, the more internal freedom you achieve, the moreyou want. It is more fun to be happy than sad, more enjoyable tochoose your emotions than to have them inflicted upon you bymechanical glandular processes, more pleasurable to solve yourproblems than to be stuck with them forever.In brief, Intelligence Intensification means intelligence-study-ing-intelligence (I2), and the first thing discovered by intelli-gence-studying-intelligence (the brain studying the brain: meta-programming) is that the more types of intelligence you have, themore fun it is to try to develop even more subtle, sensitive,futique levels of awareness; higher intelligence still.In summary, Intelligence Intensification is desirable, becausethere is not a single problem confronting humanity that is not"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Prometheus Rising   279either caused or considerably worsened by the prevailing stupid-ity (insensitivity) of the species: badly wired robots bumping intoand maiming and killing each other.Intelligence Intensification is attainable, because modernadvances in neuroscience are showing us how to alter anyimprinted, conditioned or learned reflex that previously restrictedus.Intelligence Intensification is hedonic, because the more free-dom and consciousness you achieve, the more you want; the lesswilling you are to slip back to dumb, blind, mechanistic circuits.Intelligence Intensification can accelerate our progress towardabolition of war and poverty; find cures for cancer and schizo-phrenia; achieve space migration and life extension (giving usspace enough and time enough to achieve even more cosmiclevels of awareness); or accomplish any other worthwhile goals.Like death and poverty, stupidity has been around so long thatpeople cannot imagine human life without it, but it is rapidlybecoming obsolete. However many special interest groups (intel-ligence agencies so-called, advertisers, tyrants, clergy, etc.) mayprofit from stupidity, humanity as a whole will profit more for itsabolition.Approximately 50% of the human race has not evolved fullyinto the third circuit yet.

Lookingat human history in terms of this metaphor we clearly see that:In the Old Stone Age, the acceleration factor was just slowlybeginning to operate. We could estimate change then in, perhaps,revolutions per 10,000 years.With the neolithic revolution and urbanization soon after, thepace began to pick up.
