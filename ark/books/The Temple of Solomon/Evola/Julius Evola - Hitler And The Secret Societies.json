As we penetrate deeper into this new (and old) interpretation, we encountervarious problems, foremost among which is the question of the secret of degeneration.In its literal sense, this question is by no means a novel one. While contemplating themagnificent remains of cultures whose very name has not even come down to us, but whichseem to have conveyed, even in their physical material, a greatness and power that is more thanearthly, scarcely anyone has failed to ask themselves questions about the death of cultures, andsensed the inadequacy of the reasons that are usually given to explain it.We can thank the Comte de Gobineau for the best and best-known summary of this problem, andalso for a masterly criticism of the main hypotheses about it. His solution on the basis of racialthought and racial purity also has a lot of truth in it, but it needs to be expanded by a fewobservations concerning a higher order of things. For there have been many cases in which aculture has collapsed even when its race has remained pure, as is especially clear in certaingroups that have suffered slow, inexorable extinction despite remaining as racially isolated as ifthey were islands. An example quite close at hand is the case of the Swedes and the Dutch. Thesepeople are in the same racial condition today as they were two centuries ago, but there is little tobe found now of the heroic disposition and the racial awareness that they once possessed. Othergreat cultures seem merely to have remained standing in the condition of mummies: they havelong been inwardly dead, so that it takes only the slightest push to knock them down. This wasthe case, for example, with ancient Peru, that giant solar empire which was annihilated by a fewadventurers drawn from the worst rabble of Europe.If we look at the secret of degeneration from the exclusively traditional point of view, it becomeseven harder to solve it completely. It is then a matter of the division of all cultures into two maintypes. On the one hand there are the traditional cultures, whose principle is identical andunchangeable, despite all the differences evident on the surface. The axis of these cultures andthe summit of their hierarchical order consists of metaphysical, supra-individual powers andactions, which serve to inform and justify everything that is merely human, temporal, subject tobecoming and to \"history.\" On the other hand there is \"modern culture,\" which is actually theanti-tradition and which exhausts itself in a construction of purely human and earthly conditionsand in the total development of these, in pursuit of a life entirely detached from the \"higherworld.\"From the standpoint of the latter, the whole of history is degeneration, because it shows theuniversal decline of earlier cultures of the traditional type, and the decisive and violent rise of anew universal civilization of the \"modern\" type.A double question arises from this."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4First, how was it ever possible for this to come to pass? There is a logical error underlying thewhole doctrine of evolution: it is impossible that the higher can emerge from the lower, and thegreater from the less. But doesn't a similar difficulty face us in the solution of the doctrine ofinvolution? How is it ever possible for the higher to fall? If we could make do with simpleanalogies, it would be easy to deal with this question. A healthy man can become sick; a virtuousone can turn to vice. There is a natural law that everyone takes from granted: that every livingbeing starts with birth, growth, and strength, then come old age, weakening, and disintegration.And so forth. But this is just making statements, not explaining, even if we allow that suchanalogies actually relate to the question posed here.Secondly, it is not only a matter of explaining the possibility of the degeneration of a particularcultural world, but also the possibility that the degeneration of one cultural cycle may pass toother peoples and take them down with it. For example, we have not only to explain how theancient Western reality collapsed, but also have to show the reason why it was possible for\"modern\" culture to conquer practically the whole world, and why it possessed the power todivert so many peoples from any other type of culture, and to hold sway even where states of atraditional kind seemed to be alive (one need only recall the Aryan East).In this respect, it is not enough to say that we are dealing with a purely material and economicconquest. That view seems very superficial, for two reasons. In the first place, a land that isconquered on the material level also experiences, in the long run, influences of a higher kindcorresponding to the cultural type of its conqueror. We can state, in fact, that European conquestalmost everywhere sows the seeds of \"Europeanization,\" i.e., the \"modern\" rationalist, tradition-hostile, individualistic way of thinking. Secondly, the traditional conception of culture and thestate is hierarchical, not dualistic. Its bearers could never subscribe, without severe reservations,to the principles of \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's\" and \"My kingdom is not ofthis world.\" For us, \"Tradition\" is the victorious and creative presence in the world of that whichis \"not of this world,\" i.e., of the Spirit, understood as a power that is mightier than any merelyhuman or material one.This is a basic idea of the authentically traditional view of life, which does not permit us to speakwith contempt of merely material conquests. On the contrary, the material conquest is the sign, ifnot of a spiritual victory, at least of a spiritual weakness or a kind of spiritual \"retreat\" in thecultures that are conquered and lose their independence. Everywhere that the Spirit, regarded asthe stronger power, was truly present, it never lacked for means - visible or otherwise - to enableall the opponent's technical and material superiority to be resisted. But this has not happened. Itmust be concluded, then, that degeneracy was lurking behind the traditional facade of everypeople that the \"modern\" world has been able to conquer. The West must then have been theculture in which a crisis that was already universal assumed its acutest form. There thedegeneration amounted, so to speak, to a knockout blow, and as it took effect, it brought downwith more or less ease other peoples in whom the involution had certainly not \"progressed\" asfar, but whose tradition had already lost its original power, so that these peoples were no longerable to protect themselves from an outside assault.With these considerations, the second aspect of our problem is traced back to the first one. It ismainly a question of explicating the meaning and the possibility of degeneracy, withoutreference to other circumstances."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5For this we must be clear about one thing: it is an error to assume that the hierarchy of thetraditional world is based on a tyranny of the upper classes. That is merely a \"modern\"conception, completely alien to the traditional way of thinking. The traditional doctrine in factconceived of spiritual action as an \"action without acting\"; it spoke of the \"unmoved mover\";everywhere it used the symbolism of the \"pole,\" the unalterable axis around which every orderedmovement takes place (and elsewhere we have shown that this is the meaning of the swastika,the \"arctic cross\"); it always stressed the \"Olympian,\" spirituality, and genuine authority, as wellas its way of acting directly on its subordinates, not through violence but through \"presence\";finally, it used the simile of the magnet, wherein lies the key to our question, as we shall nowsee.Only today could anyone imagine that the authentic bearers of the Spirit, or of Tradition, pursuepeople so as to seize them and put them in their places - in short, that they \"manage\" people, orhave any personal interest in setting up and maintaining those hierarchical relationships by virtueof which they can appear visibly as the rulers. This would be ridiculous and senseless. It is muchmore the recognition on the part of the lower ones that is the true basis of any traditional ranking.It is not the higher that needs the lower, but the other way round. The essence of hierarchy is thatthere is something living as a reality in certain people, which in the rest is only present in thecondition of an ideal, a premonition, an unfocused effort. Thus the latter are fatefully attracted tothe former, and their lower condition is one of subordination less to something foreign, than totheir own true \"self.\" Herein lies the secret, in the traditional world, of all readiness for sacrifice,all heroism, all loyalty; and, on the other side, of a prestige, an authority, and a calm powerwhich the most heavily-armed tyrant can never count upon.With these considerations, we have come very close to solving not only the problem ofdegeneration, but also the possibility of a particular fall. Are we perhaps not tired of hearing thatthe success of every revolution indicates the weakness and degeneracy of the previous rulers? Anunderstanding of this kind is very one-sided. This would indeed be the case if wild dogs weretied up, and suddenly broke loose: that would be proof that the hands holding their leashes hadbecome impotent or weak. But things are arranged very differently in the framework of spiritualranking, whose real basis we have explained above. This hierarchy degenerates and is able to beoverthrown in one case only: when the individual degenerates, when he uses his fundamentalfreedom to deny the Spirit, to cut his life loose from any higher reference-point, and to exist\"only for himself.\" Then the contacts are fatefully broken, the metaphysical tension, to which thetraditional organism owes its unity, gives way, every force wavers in its path and finally breaksfree. The peaks, of course, remain pure and inviolable in their heights, but the rest, whichdepended on them, now becomes an avalanche, a mass that has lost its equilibrium and falls, atfirst imperceptibly but with ever accelerating movement down to the depths and lowest levels ofthe valley. This is the secret of every degeneration and revolution. The European had first slainthe hierarchy in himself by extirpating his own inner possibilities, to which corresponded thebasis of the order that he would then destroy externally.If Christian mythology attributes the Fall of Man and the Rebellion of the Angels to the freedomof the will, then it comes to much the same significance. It concerns the frightening potential thatdwells in man of using freedom to destroy spiritually and to banish everything that could ensurehim a supra-natural value. This is a metaphysical decision: the stream that traverses history in themost varied forms of the traditional-hating, revolutionary, individualistic, and humanistic spirit,or in short, the \"modern\" spirit. This decision is the only positive and decisive cause in the secretof degeneration, the destruction of Tradition."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6If we understand this, we can perhaps also grasp the sense of those legends that speak ofmysterious rulers who \"always\" exist and have never died (shades of the Emperor sleepingbeneath the Kyffhäuser mountain!). Such rulers can be rediscovered only when one achievesspiritual completeness and awakens a quality in oneself like that of a metal that suddenly feels\"the magnet\", finds the magnet and irresistibly orients itself and moves towards it. For now, wemust restrict ourselves to this hint. A comprehensive explanation of legends of that sort, whichcome to us from the most ancient Aryan source, would take us too far. At another opportunity wewill perhaps return to the secret of reconstruction, to the \"magic\" that is capable of restoring thefallen mass to the unalterable, lonely, and invisible peaks that are still there in the heights."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7REGRESSION OF THE CASTESAs my intent was to offer a bird's-eye view of history, in the previous pages I have presented allthe elements necessary to formulate an objective law at work in the various stages of the processof decadence, that is, the law of the regression of castes (1). A progressive shift of power andtype of civilization has ocurred from one caste to the next since prehistoric times (from sacredleaders, to a warrior aristocracy, to the merchants, and finally to the serfs); these castes intraditional civilizations corresponded to the qualitative differentiation of the main humanpossibilities. In the face of this general movement anything concerning the various conflictsamong peoples, the life of nations, or other historical accidents plays only a secondary andcontingent role.I have alredy discussed the dawn of the age of the first caste. In the West, the representatives ofthe divine royalty and the leaders who embody the two powers (spiritual and temporal), in what Ihave called \"spiritual virility\" and \"Olympian sovereignity,\" belong to a very distant and almostmythical past. We have seen how, through the gradual deterioration of the Light of the North, theprocess of decadence has unfolded; in the Ghibelline ideal of the Holy Roman Empire I haveidentified the last echo of the highest tradition.Once the appex dissapeared, authority descended to the level inmediately below, that is, to thecaste of the warriors. The stage was then set for monarchs who were mere military leaders, lordsof temporal justice and, in more recent times, politically absolute sovereigns. In other words,regality of blood replaced regality of the spirit. In a few instances it is still posible to find theidea of \"divine right,\" but only as a formula lacking a real content. We find such rulers inantiquity behind institutions that retained the traits of the ancient sacred regime only in a formalway. In any event in the West, with the dissolution of the medieval ecumene, the passage into thesecond phase became all-enbracing and definitive. During this stage, the fides cementing thestate no longer had a religious character, but only a warrior one; it meant loyalty, faithfulness,honor. This was essentially the age and the cycle of the Great European monarchies.Then a second collapse ocurred as the aristocracies began to fall into decay and the monarchiesto shake at the foundations; through revolutions and constitutions they became uselessinstitutions subject to the \"will of the nation,\" and sometimes they were even ousted by differentregimes. The principle characterizyng this state of affairs was: \"The king reigns but he does notrule.\" Together with parliamentary republics the formation of the capitalist oligarchies revealedthe shift of power from the second caste (the warrior) to the modern equivalent of the third caste(the mercantile class). The kings of the coal, oil, and iron industries replace the previous kings ofblood and of spirit. Antiquity, too, sometimes knew this phenomenon in sporadics forms; inRome and in Greece the \"aristocracy of welth\" repatedly forced the han of the hierarchicalstructure by pursuing aristocratic positions, undermining sacred laws and traditional institutions,and inflitrating the militia, priesthood, or consulship. In later times what ocurred was the rebelionof the communes and the rise of the various madieval formations of mercantile power. Thesolemn proclamation of the \"rights of the Third Estate\" in France represented the decisive stage,followed by the varieties of \"bourgeois revolution\" of the third caste, which employed liberal anddemocratic ideologies for its own purposes. Correspondingly, this era was characterized by thetheory of the social contract. At this time the social bond was no longer a fides of a warrior typebased on relationships of faithfulness and honor. Instead, it took on a utilitarian and economiccharacter; it consisted of an agreement based on personal convenience and on material interest"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8that only a merchant could have conceived. Gold became a means ad powerful tool; those whoknew how to acquire it and to multiply it (capitalism, high finance, industrial trusts), behind theappereances of democracy, virtually controlled political power and the instruments employed inthe art of opinionmaking. Aristocracy gave way to plutocracy, the warrior, to the banker andindustrialist. The economy triumphed on all fronts. Trafficking with money and charginginterest, activities previouly confined to the ghettos, invaded the new civilisation. According tothe expression of W. Sombart, in the promised land of Protestant puritanism, Americanism,capitalism, and the \"destilled Jewish spirit\" coexist. It is natural that given these congenialpremises, the modern representatives of secularized Judaism saw the ways to achieve worlddomination open up before them. In this regard, Karl Marx wrote:What are the mundane principles of Judaism? Practical necessity and the pursuit of one's ownadvantage. What is its earthly god? Money. The Jew has emancipated himself in a typicallyJewish fashion not only in that he has taken control of the power of money, but also in thatthrough him, money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit of the Christianpeople. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews. Thegod of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the earth. The exchange isthe true god of the Jews. (2)In reality, the codification of the traffic with gold as a loan charged with interest, to which theJews had been previously devoted since they had no other means through which they couldaffirm themselves, may be said to be the very foundation of the acceptance of the aberrantdevelopment of all that is banking, high finance, and pure economy, which are spreading like acancer in the modern world. This is the fundamental time in the \"age of the merchants\".Finally the crisis of bourgeois society, classs truggle, the proletarian revolt against capitalism, themanifest promulgated at the \"Third International\" in 1919, and the correlative organization of thegroups and the masses in the cadres proper to a \"socialist civilization of labor\" -all these bearwitness to the third collapse, in which power tends to pass into the hands of the lowest of thetraditional castes, the caste of the beasts of burden and the standardized individuals. The result ofthis transfer of power was a reduction of horizon and value to the plane of matter, the machine,and the reign of quantity. The prelude to this was the Russian Revolution. Thus, the new idealbecame the \"proletarian\" ideal of a universal and communist civilization. (3)We may compare the above mentioned phaenomenon of the awakening and gushing forth ofelemental subhuman forces within the structures of the modern world to a person who can nolonger endure the tension of the spirit (first caste), and eventually not even the tension of the willas afree force that animates the body (warrior caste), and who thus gives in to the subpersonalforces of the organic system and all of a sudden reacts almost magnetically under the impulse ofanother life taht replaces his own. The ideas and the passions of the demos soon escape men ́scontrol and they begin to act as if they had acquired an autonomous and dreadful life of theirown. These passions pit nations and collectivities against each other and result in unprecedentedconflicts and crises. At the end of the process, once the total collapse has ocurred, the awaits aninternational system under the brutal symbols of the hammer and the sickle."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9Such are the horizons facing the contemporary world. Just as it is only by adhering to freeactivity that man can truly be free and realize his own self, likewise, by focusing on practical andutilitarian goals, economic achievements, and whatever was once the exclusive domain of theinferior castes man abdicates, desintegrates, loses his center, and opens himself to infernal forcesof which he is destined to become the unwilling and unconscious instrument. Moreover,contemporary society looks like an organism that has shifted from a human to a subhuman type,in which every activity and reaction is determined by the needs of the dictate of purely physicallife. Man's dominating principles are those of the material part of traditional hierarchies: goldand work. This is how things are today; these two elements, almost without exception ,affectevery possibility of existence and give shape to the ideoloies and myths that clearly testify to thegravity of he modern perversion of all values.Not only has the quadripartite regression have a sociopolitical scope, but it also inverts everydomain of civilization. In architecture the regression is symbolized by the shift from the temple(first caste) as the dominant building, to the fortress and castle (caste of warriors), to the city-state surrounded by protecting walls (age of the merchants) , to the factory, and finally to therational and dull buildings that are the hives of the mass-man. The family, which in the originshas a sacred foundation, shifted to an authoritarian model (patria potestas in a mere juridicalsense), then to a bourgeois and conventional one, until it will finally disolve when the party, thepeople, and society will supersede in importance and dignity. The notion of war underwentanalogous phases: from the doctrine of the \"sacred war\" and of the mors triumpalis a shiftoccured to the war waged in the name of the right and of the honor of one's lord (warrior caste);in the third stage conflicts are brought about by national ambitions that are contingent upon theplans and the interests of a supremacist economy and industry (caste of merchants); finally therearose the communist theory according to which war among nations is just a bourgeois residue,since the only just war is the world revolution of the proletarian class waged against the capitalistand the so-called imperialist world (caste of serfs). In the aesthetic dimension a shift occurredfrom a symbolic, sacred art closely related to the possibilities of predicing future evets and magic(first caste), to the predominance of epic art and poems (caste of the warriors); this was followedby a shift to a romantic, conventional, sentimentalist, erotic, and psychological art that isproduced for the consumption of the bourgeois class, until finally, new \"social\" or \"sociallyinvolved\" views of art begin to emerge that advocate an art for the use and consumption of themasses. The traditional work knew the superindividual unity characterizing the orders: in theWest first came ascetics, monastic orders; these were followed by knightly orders (caste of thewarriors), which in turn were followed by the unity sworn to in Masonic lodges, which workedhard to prepare the revolution of the Third Estate and the advent of democracy. Finally therecame the network of revolutionary and activist cadres of the Communist International (lastcaste), bent on the destruction of the previous sociopolitical order.It is on the plane of ethics that the process of degradation is particularly visible. While the firstage was characterized by the ideal of \"sipirital virility\", initiation, and an ethics aimed atovercoming all human bonds; and while the age of the warriors was characterized by the ideal ofheroism, victory, and lorship, as well as by the aristocratic ethics of honor, faithfulness, andchevalry, during the age of the merchants the predominant ideals where of pure economics, profitprosperity, an of science as an instrument of a technical and industrial progress that propelsproduction and new profits in a \"consumer society\". Finally the advent of the serfs correspondsto the elevation of the slave's principle -work- to the status of a religion. It is the hatred harboredby the slave that sadistically proclaims: \"If anyone will not work, neither let him eat\" (2 Thess,3:10). The slave's self-congratulating stupidity created sacred incenses with the exaltation of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10human sweat, hence expressions such as \"Work ennobles man\"; \"The religion of work\"; and\"Work as a social and ethical duty\". We have previouly learned that the ancient world despisedwork only because it knew action; the opposition of action to work as an opposition between thespiritual, pure and free pole, and the material, impure pole impregnated only with humanpossibilities, was at the basis of that contempt. The loss of the sense of this opposition and theanimal-like subordination of the former to the latter, characterizes the last ages. And when inancient times every work, through an inner transfiguration owing to its purity and its meaning asan \"offering\" oriented upwards could redeem itself until it became a symbol of action, now,following an upheaval in the opposite direction (which can be observed during the age of theserfs), every residue of action tends to be degraded to the form of work. The degeneration of theancient aristocratic and sacred ethics into the modern plebiean and materialistic morality isexpressively characterized by such a shift from the plane of action to the plane of work. Superiormen who lived in a not so distant past, eother acted or directed actions. Modern man works (4).The only real difference today is that which exists between the various kinds of work; there are\"intellectual\" workers and those whose their limbs and machines. In any event, the notion of\"action\" is dying out in the modern world, together with that of absolute personality. Moreover,among all the commissioned arts, antiquity regarded as most disgraceful those devoted to thepursuit of pleasure -minimaeque artes esa probandae, quae ministrae sunt voluptatum (5), this,after all, is precisely the kind of work respected the most in this day and age. Begining with thescientist, technician, and politician, and with the rationalyzed system of productive organization,\"work\" supposedly leads to the realization of an ideal more fitting for a human animal: an easierlife that is more enjoyable and safer with the maximization of one's well-being and physicalcomfort. The contemporary breed of artists and of \"creative minds\" of the burgoise is theequivalent of that class of \"luxury servants\" that catered to the pleasure and distractions of theRoman patriciate and later on, of the medieval feudal lords.Then again, while the themes proper to this degradation find their most characteristicsexpressions on the social plane and in contemporary life, they do not fail to make an appearanceon the ideal and speculative plane. It was precisely during the age of humanism that theantitraditional and plebeian theme emerged in the views of Giordano Bruno who, by invertingtraditional values, extolled the age of human effort and work over and against the Golden Age(of which he knew absolutely nothing) in a masochistic fashion and with authentic stupidity.Bruno called \"divine\" the brutish drive of human need, since such a drive is responsible forproducing \"increasingly wonderful arts and inventions\", for removing mankind further from theGolden Age that he regarded as animalistic and lazy, and for drawing human beings closer toGod (6). In all this we find an anticipation of those ideologies that, by virtue of beingsignificantly connected to the age of the French Revolution, regarded work as the main elementof the social myth and revived the messianic theme in terms of work and machines, all the whilesinging the praises of progress. Moreover, modern man, whether consciously or unconsciously,began to apply to the universe and project on an ideal plane the experiences that he nurtured inthe workshops and factories and by which the soul became a product. Bergson, who exalted theélan vital, is the one who drew the analogy as only a modern could between technical productiveactivity inspired by a mere practical principle and the ways of intelligence itself. Having coveredwith ridicule the ancient \"inert\" idea of knowledge as contemplation,The entire effort of modern epistemology in its most radical trajectories consists in assimilatingknowledge to productive work, according to the postulates: \"To know is to do\" and \"One canonly really know what one does\" (7)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11Verum et factum convertuntur. And since according to the unrealism typical of these currents, (a)\"to be\" means \"to know\"; (b) the spirit is identified with the idea; and (c) the productive andimmanent knowing process is identified with the process of reality, the way of the fourth caste isreflected in the highest regions and posits itself as their foundational \"truth\". Likewise, there isan activism on the plane of philosophical theories that\u001f appears to be in agreement with theworld created by the advent of the last caste and its \"civilization of work\".Generally speaking, this advent is reflected in the abovementioned modern ideologies of\"progress\" and Evolution\", which have distorted a \"scientific\" irresponsibility any superior visionof history, promoted the definitive abandonment of traditional truths, and created the mostspecious alibis for the justification and glorification of modern man. The myth of evolutionism isnothing else but the profession of faith of the upstart. If in recent times the West no longerbelieves in the nobility of the origins but in the notion that civilization arises out of barbarism,religion from superstition, man from animal, (Darwin), thought from matter, and every spiritualform from the \"sublimation\" or transposition of the stuff that originates the instinct, libido, andcomplexes of the \"collective unconscious\" (Freud, Jung), and so on-we can see in all this not somuch the result of a deviated quest, but rather, and above all, and alibi or something that acivilization created by both lower beings and the revolutions of the serfs and pariahs against theancient aristocratic society necessarily had to believe in and wish to be true. There is not adimension in which, in one form or another, the evolutionary myth had not succeeded ininfiltrating with destructive consequences; the results have been the overthrow of every value,the suppression of all sense of truth, the elaboration and connecting together (as in anunbreakable magical circle) of the world inhabited by a deconsecrated and deluded mankind. Inagreement with historicism, so-called post-Hegelian Idealism came to identify the essence of the\"Absolute Spirit\" with its \"becoming\" and its \"self-creation\" -this Spirit was no longer conceivedas a Being that is, that dominates, and that possesses itself; the self-made man has almost becomethe new metaphysical model.It is not easy to separate the process of regression along the way of gold (age of merchants) fromthe regression along the way of work (age of serfs), since these ways are interdependent. For allpractical purposes, just as today work as a universal duty is no longer perceived as a repugnant,absurd, an unnatural value, likewise, to be paid does not seem repugnant but on the contrary itseems very natural. Money, which no longer \"burns\" the hands it touches, has established aninvisible bond of slavery that is worse and more depraved than that which the high spiritual\"stature\" of lords and conquerors used to retain and justify.Just as any form of action tends to become yet another form of work so is it always associatedwith payment. And while on the one hand action reduced to work is judged by its efficiency incontemporary societies, just as man is valued by his practical success and by his profit; andwhile, as someone has remarked, Calvin acted as a pimp by seeing that profit and wealth wereshrouded in the mysticism of a divine election-on the other hand, the specter of hunger andunemployment lurks upon these new slaves as a more fearful threat than the threat of the whip inancient times.In any event, it is possible to distinguish a general phase in which the yearning for profitdisplayed by single individuals who pursue wealth and power is the central motif (the phase thatcorresponds to the advent of the third caste) from a further phase that is still unfolding,characterized by a sovereign economy that has become almost independent or collectivized (theadvent of the last caste)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12In this regard, it is interesting to note that the regression of the principle of \"action\" to the formproper to the inferior caste (work, production) is often accompanied by an analogous regressionwith regard to the principle of \"asceticism\". What arises is almost a new asceticism of gold andwork, because as it is exemplified by representatives figures of this phase, to work and amass afortune become things that are yearned for and loved for their own sake, as if they were avocation. Thus we often see, specially in America, powerful capitalists who enjoy their wealthless that the last of their employees; rather than owing riches and being free from them and thusemploying them to fund forms of magnificence, quality, and sensibility for various precious andprivileged spectacles (as was the case in ancient aristocracies), these people appear to be merelymanagers of their fortunes. Rich though they may be, they pursue an increasing number ofactivities; it is almost as if they were impersonal and ascetical instruments whose activity isdevoted to gathering, multiplying, and casting into ever wider nets (that sometimes affect thelives of millions of people and the destinies of entire nations) the faceless forces of money and ofproduction (8). Fiat productio, pereat homo, Sombart correctly remarked when noticing that thespiritual destruction and emptiness that man has created around himself, after he became \"homoeconomicus\" and a great capitalist entrepreneur, force him to turn his activity (profit, business,prosperity) into an end in itself, to love it and will it for its own sake lest he fall victim to thevertigo of the abyss and the horror of a life is totally meaningless (9).Even the relationship of the modern economy to the machines is significant with regard to thearousal of forces that surpass the plans of those who initially evoked them and carry everythingalong them. Once all interest for anything superior and transcendent was either lost or laughed at,the only reference point remaining was man's need, in a purely material and animal sense.Moreover, the traditional principle of the limitation of one's need within the context of a normaleconomy (a balanced economy based on consumption) was replaced with the principle ofacceptance and multiplication of need, which paralleled the so-called Industrial Revolution andthe advent of the age of the machines. Technological innovations have automatically ledmankind from production to overproduction. After the \"activist\" frenzy as awoken and the franticcirculation of capital-which is multiplied through production in order to be put again incirculation through further productive investments-was set in motion, mankind has finallyarrived at a point where the relationship between need and machine (or work) have been totallyreversed; it is no longer need that requires mechanical work, but mechanical work (orproduction) that generates new needs. In a regime of superproduction, in order for all theproducts to be sold it is necessary that the needs of single individuals, far from being reduced, bemaintained an even multiplied so that consumption may increase and the mechanism be keptrunning in order to avoid the fatal congestion that would bring about one of the following twoconsequences: either war, understood as the means for a violent affirmation by a greatereconomic and productive power that claims not to have \"enough space\", or unemployment(industrial shutdowns as a response to the crisis on the job and market and in consumerism) withits ensuing crises and social tensions precipitating the insurrection of the Fourth Estate.As a fire starts another fire until an entire area goes up in flames, this is how the economy hasaffected the inner essence of modern man through the world that he himself created.. Thispresent \"civilization\", starting from Western hotbeds, has extended the contagion to every landthat was still healthy and has brought to all strata of society and all races the following \"gifts\":restlessness, dissatisfaction, resentment, the need to go further and faster, and the inability toposses one's life in simplicity, independence, and balance.

Thus, every new invention and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13technological discovery, rather than a conquest, really represents a defeat and a new whiplash inan ever faster race blindly taking place within a system of conditionings that are increasinglyserious and irreversible and that for the most part go unnoticed. This is how the various pathsconverge: technological civilization, the dominant role of the economy, and the civilization ofproduction and consumption all complement the exaltation of becoming and progress; in otherwords, they contribute to the manifestation of the \"demonic\" element in the modern world (10).Regarding the degenerated forms of asceticism, I would lie o point out the spirit of aphenomenon that is ore properly connected to the plane of \"work\" (that is, of the fourth caste).The modern world knows a sublimated version of work in which the latter becomes\"desinterested\", disjoined from the economic factor and from the idea of a practical or productivegoal an takes an almost ascetic form; I am talking about sport. Sport is a way of working inwhich the productive objective no longer matters; thus, sport is willed for its own sake as mereactivity. Someone has rightly pointed out that sport is the \"blue collar\" religion (11). Sport is atypical counterfeit of action in the traditional sense of the word. A pointless activity, it isnevertheless still characterized by the same triviality of work and belongs to the same physicaland lightless group of activities that are pursued at the various crossroads in which plebeiancontamination occurs. Although through the practice of sport it is possible to achieve atemporary evocation of deep forces, what this amounts to is the enjoyment of sensations and asense of vertigo and at most, the excitement derived from directing one's energies and winning acompetition-without any higher and transfiguring reference, any sense of \"sacrifice\" ordeindividualizing offering being present. Physical individuality is cherished and strengthened bysport; thus the chain is confirmed and every residue of subtler sensibility is suffocated. Thehuman being, instead of growing into an organic being, tends to be reduced to a bundle ofreflexes, an almost to a mechanism. It is also very significant that the lower strata of society arethe ones that show more enthusiasm for sports, displaying their enthusiasm in great collectiveforms. Sport may be identified as one of the forewarning signs of that type of society representedby Chigalev in Dostoyevsky's The Obsessed; after the required time has elapsed for a methodicaland reasoned education aimed at extirpating the evil represented by the \"I\" and by free will, andno longer realizing they are slaves, all the Chigalevs will return to experience the innocence andthe happiness of a new Eden. This \"Eden\" differs from the biblical one only because work willbe the dominating universal law. Work as sport and sport as work in a world that has lost thesense of historical cycles, as well as the sense of true personality, would probably be the bestway to implement such a messianic idea. Thus, it is not a coincidence that in several societies,whether spontaneously or thanks to the state, great sports organizations have arisen as theappendices of various classes of workers, and vice versa.NOTES:* This artícle is the chapter XIV, 2º Part, of Revolt against the modern world, Inner TraditionsInternational, Rochester, USA, 1995.

This is quite right. His theories are entirelyrepresentative of the vision of man and life which is the premise of Americanism and its'democracy'.The essence of such theories is this: that everyone can become what he wants to, within thelimits of the technological means at his disposal. Equally, a person is not what he is from his truenature and there is no real difference between people, only differences in qualifications.According to this theory anyone can be anyone he wants to be if he knows how to train himself.This is obviously the case with the 'self-made man'; in a society which has lost all sense oftradition the notion of personal aggrandisement will extend into every aspect of human existence,reinforcing the egalitarian doctrine of pure democracy. If the basis of such ideas is accepted, thenall natural diversity has to be abandoned. Each person can presume to possess the potential ofeveryone else and the terms 'superior' and 'inferior' lose their meaning; every notion of distanceand respect loses meaning; all life-styles are open to all. To all organic conceptions of lifeAmericans oppose a mechanistic conception. In a society which has 'started from scratch',everything has the characteristic of being fabricated. In American society appearances are masksnot faces. At the same time, proponents of the American way of life are hostile to personality.The Americans' 'open-mindedness', which is sometimes cited in their favour, is the other side oftheir interior formlessness. The same goes for their 'individualism'. Individualism and personalityare not the same: the one belongs to the formless world of quantity, the other to the world ofquality and hierarchy. The Americans are the living refutation of the Cartesian axiom, \"I think,therefore I am\": Americans do not think, yet they are. The American 'mind', puerile andprimitive, lacks characteristic form and is therefore open to every kind of standardisation.In a superior civilisation, as, for example, that of the Indo-Aryans, the being who is without acharacteristic form or caste (in the original meaning of the word), not even that of servant orshudra, would emerge as a pariah. In this respect America is a society of pariahs. There is a rolefor pariahs. It is to be subjected to beings whose form and internal laws are precisely defined.Instead the modern pariahs seek to become dominant themselves and to exercise their dominionover all the world.There is a popular notion about the United States that it is a 'young nation' with a 'great futurebefore it'. Apparent American defects are then described as the 'faults of youth' or 'growingpains'. It is not difficult to see that the myth of 'progress' plays a large part in this judgement.According to the idea that everything new is good, America has a privileged role to play amongcivilised nations. In the First World War the United States intervened in the role of 'the civilisedworld' par excellence. The 'most evolved' nation had not only a right but a duty to interfere in thedestinies of other peoples.The structure of history is, however, cyclical not evolutionary. It is far from being the case thatthe most recent civilisations are necessarily 'superior'. They may be, in fact, senile and decadent.There is a necessary correspondence between the most advanced stages of a historical cycle andthe most primitive. America is the final stage of modern Europe.

The American mentality can onlybe interpreted as an example of regression, which shows itself in the mental atrophy towards allhigher interests and incomprehension of higher sensibility. The American mind has limitedhorizons, one conscribed to e! veryth ing which is immediate and simplistic, with the inevitableconsequence that everything is made banal, basic and levelled down until it is deprived of allspiritual life. Life itself in American terms is entirely mechanistic. The sense of 'I' in Americabelongs entirely to the physical level of existence. The typical American neither has spiritualdilemmas nor complications: he is a 'natural' joiner and conformist.The primitive American mind can only superficially be compared to a young mind. TheAmerican mind is a feature of the regressive society to which I have already referred.American MoralityThe much-vaunted sex appeal of American women is drawn from films, reviews and pin-ups,and is in large print fictitious. A recent medical survey in the United States showed that 75 percent of young American women are without strong sexual feeling and instead of satisfying theirlibido they seek pleasure narcissistically in exhibitionism, vanity and the cult of fitness andhealth in a sterile sense. American girls have 'no hang-ups about sex'; they are 'easy going' for theman who sees the whole sexual process as something in isolation thereby making it uninterestingand matter-of-fact, which, at such a level, it is meant to be. Thus, after she has been taken to thecinema or a dance, it is something like American good manners for the girl to let herself bekissed - this doesn't mean anything. American women are characteristically frigid andmaterialistic. The man who 'has his way' with an American girl is under a material obligation toher. The woman has granted a materia! l favour. In cases of divorce American lawoverwhelmingly favours the woman. American women will divorce readily enough when theysee a better bargain. It is frequently the case in America that a woman will be married to one manbut already 'engaged' to a future husband, the man she plans to marry after a profitable divorce.\"Our\" American MediaAmericanisation in Europe is widespread and evident. In Italy it is a phenomenon which israpidly developing in these post-war years and is considered by most people, if notenthusiastically, at least as something natural. Some time ago I wrote that of the two greatdangers confronting Europe - Americanism and Communism - the first is the more insidious.Communism cannot be a danger other than in the brutal and catastrophic form of a direct seizureof power by communists. On the other hand Americanisation gains ground by a process ofgradual infiltration, effecting modifications of mentalities and customs which seem inoffensivein themselves but which end in a fundamental perversion and degradation against which it isimpossible to fight other than within oneself.It is precisely with respect to such internal opposition that most Italians seem weak. Forgettingtheir own cultural inheritance they readily turn to the United States as something akin to theparent guide of the world. Whoever wants to be modern has to measure himself according to theAmerican standard. It is pitiable to witness a European country so debase itself. Veneration forAmerica has nothing to do with a cultured interest in the way other people live. On the contrary,servility towards the United States leads one to think that there is no other way of life worthconsidering on the same level as the American one."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17Our radio service is Americanised.

Even the style of presentation on radio has becomeAmericanised. \"Who, after listening to an American radio programme, can suppress a shudderwhen he considers that the only way of escaping communism is by becoming Americanised?\"Those are not the words of an outsider but of an American sociologist, James Burnham,professor at the University of Princeton. Such a judgement from an American should makeItalian radio programmers blush for shame.The consequence of the 'do your own thing' democracy is the intoxication of the greater part ofthe population which is not capable of discriminating for itself, which, when not guided by apower and an ideal, all too easily loses sense of its own identity.The Industrial Order in AmericaIn his classic study of capitalism Werner Sombart summarised the late capitalist phase in theadage Fiat producto, pareat homo. In its extreme form capitalism is a system in which a man'svalue is estimated solely in terms of the production of merchandise and the invention of themeans of production. Socialist doctrines grew out of a reaction to the lack of humanconsideration in this system.A new phase has begun in the United States where there has been an upsurge of interest in so-called labor relations. In appearance it would seem to signify an improvement: in reality this is adeleterious phenomenon. The entrepreneurs and employers have come to realise the importanceof the 'human factor' in a productive economy, and that it is a mistake to ignore the individualinvolved in industry: his motives, his feelings, his working day life. Thus, a whole school ofstudy of human relations in industry has grown up, based on behaviourism. Studies like HumanRelations in Industry by B. Gardner and G. Moore have supplied a minute analysis of thebehaviour of employees and their motivations with the precise aim of defining the best means toobviate all factors that can hinder the maximisation of production. Some studies certainly don'tcome from the shop floor but from the management, abetted by specialists from various colleges.The sociological investigations go as far! as analysing the employee's social ambience. This kindof study has a practical purpose: the ma intenance of the psychological contentment of theemployee is as important as the physical. In cases in which a worker is tied to a monotonous jobwhich doesn't demand a great deal of concentration, the studies will draw attention to the 'danger'that his mind may tend to wander in a way that may eventually reflect badly on his attitudetowards the job.The private lives of employees are not forgotten - hence the increase in so-called personnelcounselling. Specialists are called in to dispel anxiety, psychological disturbances and non-adaptation 'complexes', even to the point of giving advice in relation to the most personalmatters. A frankly psycho-analytic technique and one much used is to make the subject 'talkfreely' and put the results obtainable by this 'catharsis' into relief.None of this is concerned with the spiritual betterment of human beings or any real humanproblems, such as a European would understand them in this \"age of economics\". On the otherside of the Iron Curtain man is treated as a beast of burden and his obedience is maintained by"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18terror and famine. In the United States man is also seen as just a factor of labour andconsumption, and no aspect of his interior life is neglected and every factor of his existence isdrawn to the same end. In the 'Land of the Free', through every medium, man is told he hasreached a degree of happiness hitherto undreamed of. He forgets who he is, where he came from,and basks in the present.American \"Democracy\" in IndustryThere is a significant and growing discrepancy in the United States between the shibboleths ofthe prevailing political ideology and the effective economic structures of the nation. A large partof studies of the subject is played by the 'morphology of business'. Studies corroborate theimpression that American business is a long way from the type of organisation whichcorresponds to the democratic ideal of U.S. propaganda. American businesses have a 'pyramid'structure. They constitute at the top an articulate hierarchy. The big businesses are run in thesame way as government ministries and are organised along similar lines. They have co-ordinating and controlling bodies which separate the business leaders from the mass ofemployees. Rather than becoming more flexible in a social sense the \"managerial elite\"(Burnham) is becoming more autocratic than ever - something not unrelated to American foreignpolicy.This is the end of yet another American illusion. America: the 'land of opportunity', where everypossibility is there for the person who can grasp it, a land where anyone can rise from rags toriches. At first there was the 'open frontier' for all to ride out across. That closed and the new'open frontier' was the sky, the limitless potential of industry and commerce. As Gardner, Mooreand many others have shown, this too is no longer limitless, and the opportunities are thinningout. Given the ever increasing specialisation of labour in the productive process and theincreasing emphasis on 'qualifications', what used to seem obvious to Americans - that theirchildren would 'go further' than they would - is for many people no longer obvious at all. Thus itis that in the so-called political democracy of the United States, the force and the power in theland, that is to say the industry and the economy, are becoming ever more self-evidentlyundemocratic. The problem then is! : should reality be made to fit ideology or vice-versa? Untilrecently the overwhelming demand has been for the former course of action; the cry goes out fora return to the 'real America' of unfettered enterprise and the individual free of centralgovernment control. Nevertheless, there are also those who would prefer to limit democracy inorder to adapt political theory to commercial reality. If the mask of American 'democracy' werethereby removed, it would become clear to what extent 'democracy' in America (and elsewhere)is only the instrument of an oligarchy which pursues a method of 'indirect action', assuring thepossibility of abuse and deception on a large scale of those many who accept a hierarchicalsystem because they think it is justly such. This dilemma of 'democracy' in the United States mayone day give place to some interesting developments."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19Against the Neo-Pagans Extract from \"Grundrisse\" (1942) by Julius EvolaThe Misunderstandings of the New \"Paganism\"It is perhaps appropriate to point out the misunderstandings that are current at the moment insome radical circles, who believe that a solution lies in the direction of a new paganism. Thismisunderstanding is already visible in the use of terms such as \"pagan\" and \"pagandom\". Imyself, having used these expressions as slogans in a book that was published in Italy in 1928,and in Germany in 1934, have cause for sincere regrets.Certainly the word for pagan or heathen, paganus, appears in some ancient Latin writers such asLivy without an especially negative tone. But this does not alter the fact that with the arrival ofthe new faith, the word paganus became a decidedly disparaging expression, as used in earlyChristian apologetics. It derives from pagus, meaning a small town or village, so that paganusrefers to the peasant way of thinking: an uncultured, primitive, and superstitious way. In order topromote and glorify the new faith, the apologists had the bad habit of elevating themselvesthrough the denigration of other faiths. There was often a conscious and often systematicdisparagement and misrepresentation of almost all the earlier traditions, doctrines, and religions,which were grouped under the contemptuous blanket-term of paganism or heathendom. To thisend, the apologists obviously made a premeditated effort to highlight those aspects of the pre-Christian religions and traditions that lacked any normal or primordial character, but were clearlyforms that had fallen into decay. Such a polemical procedure lead, in particular, to thecharacterization of whatever had preceded Christendom, and was hence non-Christian, asnecessarily anti-Christian. One should consider, then, that \"paganism\" is a fundamentallytendentious and artificial concept that scarcely corresponds to the historical reality of what thepre-Christian world always was in its normal manifestations, apart from a few decadent elementsand aspects that derived from the degenerate remains of older cultures.Once we are clear about this, we come today to a paradoxical realization: that this imaginarypaganism that never existed, but was invented by Christian apologists, is now serving as thestarting-point for certain so-called pagan circles, and is thus threatening for the first time inhistory to become a reality--no more and no less than that.What are the main traits of today's pagan outlook, as its own apologists believe and declare themto be? The primary one is the imprisonment in Nature. All transcendence is totally unknown tothe pagan view of life: it remains stuck in a mixture of Spirit and Nature, in an ambiguous unityof Body and Soul. There is nothing to its religion but a superstitious deification of naturalphenomena, or of tribal energies promoted to the status of minor gods. Out of this there arisesfirst of all a blood- and soil-bound particularism. Next comes a rejection of the values ofpersonality and freedom, and a condition of innocence that is merely that of the natural man, asyet unawakened to any truly supra-natural calling. Beyond this innocence there is only lack ofinhibition, \"sin,\" and the pleasure of sinning. In other domains there is nothing but superstition,or a purely profane culture of materialism and fatalism. It is as though only the arrival ofChristianity (ignoring certain precursors which are dismissed as insignificant) allowed the worldof supra-natural freedom to break through, letting in grace and personality, in contrast to thefatalistic and nature-bound beliefs ascribed to \"paganism,\" bringing with it a catholic ideal (in theetymological sense of universality) and a healthy dualism, which made it possible to subjugateNature to a higher law, and for the \"Spirit\" to triumph over the law of flesh, blood, and the falsegods."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20These are the main traits of the dominant understanding of paganism, i.e., of everything that doesnot entail a specifically Christian world-view. Anyone who possesses any direct acquaintancewith cultural and religious history, however elementary, can see how incorrect and one-sided thisattitude is. Besides, in the early Church Fathers there are often signs of a higher understanding ofthe symbols, doctrines, and religions of preceding cultures. Here we will give only a sampling.What most distinguished the pre-Christian world, in all its normal forms, was not thesuperstitious divinization of nature, but a symbolic understanding of it, by virtue of which (as Ihave often emphasized) every phenomenon and every event appeared as the sensible revelationof a supra-sensible world. The pagan understanding of the world and of man was essentiallymarked by sacred symbolism.Moreover, the pagan way of life was absolutely not that of a mindless innocence, nor a naturalabandonment to the passions, even if certain forms of it were obviously degenerate. It wasalready aware of a healthy dualism, which is reflected in its universal religious or metaphysicalconceptions. Here we can mention the dualistic warrior-religion of the ancient Iranian Aryans,already discussed and familiar to all; the Hellenistic antithesis between the \"two natures,\"between World and Underworld, or the Nordic one between the race of the Ases and theelementary beings; and lastly the Indo-Aryan contrast between sams'ra, the \"stream of forms,\"and m(o)kthi, \"liberation\" and \"perfection.\"On this basis, all the great pre-Christian cultures shared the striving for a supra-natural freedom,i.e., for the metaphysical perfection of the personality, and they all acknowledged Mysteries andinitiations. I have already pointed out that the Mysteries often signified the reconquest of theprimordial state, the spirituality of the solar, Hyperborean races, on the foundation of a traditionand a knowledge that were concealed through secrecy and exclusivity from the pollutions of anenvironment already in decay. We have also seen that in the Eastern lands, the Aryan quality wasalready associated with a \"second birth\" achieved through initiation. As for natural innocence asthe pagan cult of the body, that is a fairy-tale and not even in evidence among savages, fordespite the inner lack of differentiation already mentioned in connection with races \"close tonature,\" these people inhibit and constrict their lives though countless taboos in a way that isoften stricter than the morality of the so-called \"positive religions.\" And as for that which seemsto the superficial view to embody the prototype of such \"innocence,\" namely the classical ideal,that was no cult of the body: it did not belong on that side of the body-spirit duality, but on theother side.As alreay stated, the classic ideal is that of a Spirit that is so dominant that under certainfavorable spiritual conditions it molds Body and Soul to its own image, and thereby achieves aperfect harmony between the inner and the outer.Lastly, there is an aspiration away from particularism to be found everywhere in the \"pagan\"world, to which was due the imperial summons that marked the ascending phase of the Nordic-derived races. Such a summons was often metaphysically enhanced and refined, and appeared asthe natural consequence of the expansion of the ancient sacred state-concept; also as the form inwhich the victorious presence of the \"higher world\" and the paternal, Olympian principle soughtto manifest itself in the world of becoming. In this respect we might recall the old Iranianconcept of Empire and of the \"King of kings,\" with its associated doctrine of the hvarenÙ (the\"celestial glory\" with which the Aryan rulers were endowed), and the Indo-Aryan tradition of the\"World-king\" or cakravartÓ, etc., right up to the reappearance of these signifiers in the\"Olympian\" assumptions of the ancient Roman idea of State and Empire. The Roman Empire,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21too, had its sacred contents, which were systematically misunderstood or undervalued not onlyby Christendom, but also by the writers of \"positive\" history. Even the Emperor-cult had thesense of a hierarchical unity at the top of a pantheon, which was a series of separate territorialand ancestral cults belonging to the non-Roman peoples, which were freely respected so long asthey kept within their normal boundaries. Finally, concerning the \"pagan\" unity of the twopowers, spiritual and temporal, this was very far from meaning that they were fused As a \"solar\"race understood it, it expressed the superior rights that must accrue to the spiritual authority atthe center of any normal state; thus it was something quite different from the emancipation and\"supremacy\" of a merely secular state. If we were to make similar amendments in the spirit oftrue objectivity, the possibilities would be overwhelming.Further Misunderstandings Concerning the \"Pagan\" World-ViewThis having been said, there remains the real possibility of transcending certain aspects ofChristianity. But one must be quite clear: the Latin term \"transcendere\" means literally leavingsomething behind as one rises upwards, and not downwards! It is worth repeating that theprincipal thing is not the rejection of Christianity: it is not a matter of showing the sameincomprehension towards it as Christianity itself has shown, and largely continues to show,towards ancient paganism. It would rather be a matter of completing Christianity by means of ahigher and an older heritage, eliminating some of its aspects and emphasizing other, moreimportant ones, in which this faith does not necessarily contradict the universal concepts of pre-Christian spirituality.This, alas, is not the path taken by the radical circles we have mentioned. Many of these neo-pagans seem to have fallen into a trap deliberately set for them, often ending up by advocatingand defending ideas that more or less correspond to that invented, nature-bound, particularisticpagandom, lacking light and transcendence, which was the polemical creation of a Christianmisunderstanding of the pre-Christian world, and which is based, at most, on a few scatteredelements of that world in its decline and devolution. And as if this were not enough, people oftenresort to an anti-Catholic polemic which, whatever its political justification, often drags out andadapts the old clichÈs of a purely modern, rationalist and enlightenment type that have beenwell-used by Liberalism, Democracy, and Freemasonry. This was also the case, to a degree, withH. S. Chamberlain, and it appears again in a certain Italian movement that has been trying toconnect racial thinking with the \"idealistic\" doctrine of immanence.There is a general and unmistakable tendency in neo-paganism to create a new, superstitiousmysticism, based on the glorification of immanence, of Life and Nature, which is in the sharpestcontrast to that Olympian and heroic ideal of the great Aryan cultures of pre-Christian antiquity.It would indicate much more a turning towards the materialistic, maternal, and telluric side, if itdid not exhaust itself in foggy and dilettantish philosophizing. To give an example, we might askwhat exactly is meant by this \"Nature,\" on which these groups are so keen? It is little use to pointout that it is certainly not the Nature that was experienced and recognized by ancient, traditionalman, but a rational construct of the French Encyclopedist period. It was the Encyclopedists who,with definitely subversive and revolutionary motives, made up the myth of Nature as \"good,\"wise, and wholesome, in opposition to the rottenness of every human \"Culture.\" Thus we can seethat the optimistic nature-myth of Rousseau and the Encyclopedists marches in the same ranks as\"natural right,\" universalism, liberalism, humanitarianism, and the denial of any positive andstructured form of sovereignty. Moreover, the myth in question has absolutely no basis in naturalhistory. Every honest scientist knows that there is no room for \"Nature\" in the framework of histheories, which have as their object the determination of purely abstract equivalences andmathematical relationships. As far as biological research and genetics are concerned, we can"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22already see the disequilibrium that would occur the moment one held certain laws to be final,when they only apply to a partial aspect of reality. What people call \"Nature\" today has nothingto do with what nature meant to the traditional, solar man, or to the knowledge of it that wasaccessible to such a man thanks to his Olympian and regal position. There is no sign of thiswhatever in the advocates of this new mysticism.Misunderstandings of more or less the same kind. arise regarding political thought. Paganism ishere often used as the synonym for a merely worldly and yet exclusive concept of sovereignty,which turns the relationships upside-down. We have already seen that in the ancient states, theunity of the two powers meant something quite different. It provided the basis for thespiritualization of politics, whereas neo-paganism results in actually politicizing the spiritual, andthereby treading once again the false path of the Gallicans and Jacobins. In contrast, the ancientconcept of State and Empire always showed a connection to the Olympian idea.What shall we think of the attitude that regards Jewry, Rome, the Catholic Church, Freemasonry,and Communism as more or less one and the same thing, just because their presuppositions differfrom the plain thinking of the Folk? The Folk's thinking along these lines threatens to lose itselfin the dark, where no differentiation is possible any more. It shows that it has lost the genuinefeeling for the hierarchy of values, and that it cannot escape the crippling alternative ofdestructive internationalism and nationalistic particularism, whereas the traditionalunderstanding of the Empire is superior to both these concepts.To restrict ourselves to a single example: Catholic dogmatism actually fulfils a useful preventiverole by stopping worldly mysticism and suchlike eruptions from below from passing a certainfrontier; it makes a strong dam that protects the area where transcendent knowledge and thegenuinely supra-natural and non-human elements reign--or at least where they should reign. Onemay well criticize the way in which such transcendence and knowledge have been understood inChristianity, but one cannot cross over to a \"profane\" criticism that seizes on some polemicalweapon or other, fantasizes over the supposed Aryan nature of the immanence-doctrine, of\"natural religion,\" the cult of \"life,\" etc., without really losing one's level: in short, one does notthereby attain the world of primordial beginnings, but that of the Counter-Tradition or the telluricand primitive modes of being. This would in fact be the very best way of re-converting thosepeople with the best \"pagan\" talents to Catholicism!One must be wary of falling into the misunderstandings and errors that we have mentioned,which basically serve only to defend the common enemy. One must try to develop the capacityto place oneself at that level where didactic confusion cannot reach, and where all dilettantismand arbitrary intellectual activity are excluded; where one resists energetically every influencefrom confused, passionate desires and from the aggressive pleasure in polemics; where, finallyand fundamentally, nothing counts but the precise, strict, objective knowledge of the spirit of thePrimordial Tradition."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23THE MEANING AND CONTEXT OF ZENWe know the kind of interest Zen has evoked even outside specialized disciplines, since beingpopularized in the west by D.T. Suzuki through his books Introduction to Zen Buddhism andEssays in Zen Buddhism. This popular interest is due to the paradoxical encounter between Eastand West. The ailing West perceives that Zen has something \"existential\" and surrealistic tooffer. Zen's notion of a spiritual realization, free from any faith and any bond, not to mention themirage of an instantaneous and somehow gratuitous \"spiritual breakthrough\", has exercised afascinating attraction on many Westerners. However, this is true, for the most part, onlysuperficially. There is a considerable difference between the spiritual dimension of the\"philosophy of crisis\", which has become popular in the West as a consequence of itsmaterialistic and nihilist development, and the spiritual dimension of Zen, which has been rootedin the spirituality of the Buddhist tradition. Any true encounter between Zen and the West,presupposes, in a Westerner, either an exceptional predisposition, or the capability to operate ametanoia. By metanoia I mean an inner turnabout, affecting not so much one's intellectual\"attitudes\", but rather a dimension which in every time and in every place has been conceived asa deeper reality.Zen has a secret doctrine and not to be found in scriptures. It was passed on by the Buddha to hisdisciple Mahakassapa. This secret doctrine was introduced in China around the sixth centuryC.E. by Bodhidharma. The canon was transmitted in China and Japan through a succession onteachers and \"patriarchs\". In Japan it is a living tradition and has many advocates and numerousZendos (\"Halls of Meditation\").As far as the spirit informing the tradition is concerned, Zen may be considered as a continuationof early Buddhism. Buddhism arose as a vigorous reaction against the theological speculationand the shallow ritualism into which the ancient Hindu priestly caste had degraded afterpossessing a sacred, lively wisdom since ancient times. Buddha mad tabula rassa of all this: hefocused instead on the practical problem of how to overcome what in the popular mind isreferred to as \"life's suffering\". According to esoteric teachings, this suffering was considered asthe state of caducity, restlessness, \"thirst\" and the forgetfulness typical of ordinary people.Having followed the path leading to spiritual awakening and to immortality without external aid,Buddha pointed the way to those who felt an attraction to it. It is well known that Buddha is not aname, but an attribute or a title meaning \"the awakened One\", \"He who has achievedenlightenment\", or \"the awakening\". Buddha was silent about the content of his experience, sincehe wanted to discourage people from assigning to speculation and philosophizing a primacy overaction. Therefore, unlike his predecessors, he did not talk about Brahman (the absolute), or aboutAtman (the transcendental Self), but only employees the term nirvana, at the risk of beingmisunderstood. Some, in fact, thought, in their lack of understanding, that nirvana was to beidentified with the notion of \"nothingness\", an ineffable and evanescent transcendence, almostbordering on the limits of the unconscious and of a state of unaware non-being. So, in a furtherdevelopment of Buddhism, what occurred again, mutatis mutandi, was exactly the situationagainst which Buddha had reacted; Buddhism became a religion, complete with dogmas, rituals,scholasticism and mythology. It eventually became differentiated into two schools: Mahayanaand Hinayana. The former was more grandiose in metaphysics an Mahayana eventually grewcomplacent with its abstruse symbolism. The teachings of the latter school were more strict andto the point, and yet too concerned about the mere moral discipline which became increasingly"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24monastic. Thus the essential and original nucleus, namely the esoteric doctrine of theenlightenment, was almost lost.At this crucial time Zen appeared, declaring the uselessness of these so-called methods andproclaiming the doctrine of satori. Satori is a fundamental inner event, a sudden existentialbreakthrough, corresponding in essence to what I have called the \"awakening\". But thisformulation was new and original and it constituted a radical change in approach. Nirvana,which had been variously considered as the alleged Nothingness, as extinction, and as the finalend result of an effort aimed at obtaining liberation (which according to some may require morethan one lifetime), now came to be considered as the normal human condition. By these lights,every person has the nature of Buddha and every person is already liberated, and therefore,situated above and beyond birth and death. It is only necessary to become aware of it, to realizeit, to see within one's nature, according to Zen's main expression. Satori is like a timelessopening up. On the one hand, satori is something sudden and radically different from all theordinary human states of consciousness; it is like a catastrophic trauma within ordinaryconsciousness. On the other hand, satori is what leads one back to what, in a higher sense,should be considered as normal and natural; thus, it is the exact opposite of an ecstasis, or trance.It is the rediscovery and the appropriation of one's true nature: it is the enlightenment whichdraws out of ignorance or out of the subconscious the deep reality of what was and will alwaysbe, regardless of one's condition in life. The consequence of satori is a completely new way tolook at the world and at life. To those who have experienced it, everything is the same (things,other beings, one's self, \"heaven, the rivers and the vast earth\"), and yet everything isfundamentally different. It is as if a new dimension was added to reality, transforming themeaning and value. According to the Zen Masters, the essential characteristic of the newexperience is the overcoming of every dualism: of the inner and outer; the I and not I; of finitudeand infinity; being and not-being; appearance and reality; \"empty\" and \"full\"; substance andaccidents. Another characteristic is that any value posed by the finite and confused consciousnessof the individual, is no longer discernible. And thus, the liberated and the non-liberated, theenlightened and the non-enlightened, are yet one and same thing. Zen effectively perpetuates theparadoxical equation of Mahayana Buddhism, nirvana-samsara, and the Taoist saying \"thereturn is infinitely far\". It is as if Zen said: liberation should not be looked for in the next world;the very world is the next world; it is liberation and it does not need to be liberated. This is thepoint of view of satori, of perfect enlightenment, of \"transcendent wisdom\" (prajnaparamita).Basically, this consciousness is a shift of the self's center. In any situation and in any event ofordinary life, including the most trivial ones, the ordinary, dualistic and intellectual sense ofone's self is substituted with a being who no longer perceives an \"I\" opposed to a \"non-I\", andwho transcends and overcomes any antithesis. This being eventually comes to enjoy a perfectfreedom an incoercibility. He is like the wind, which blows where it wills, and like a naked beingwhich is everything after \"letting go\" -abandons everything, embracing poverty.Zen, or at least mainstream Zen, emphasizes the discontinuous, sudden and unpredictablecharacter of satori disclosure. In regard to this, Suzuki was at fault when he took issue with thetechniques used in Hindu schools such as Samkya and Yoga. These techniques were alsocontemplated in early Buddhist texts. Suzuki employed the simile of water, which in a momentturns into ice. He also used the simile of an alarm, which, as a consequence of some vibration,suddenly goes off. There are no disciplines, techniques or efforts, according to Suzuki, which bythemselves may lead one to satori. On the contrary, it is claimed that satori often occursspontaneously, when one has exhausted all the resources of his being, especially the intellect and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25logical faculty of understanding. In some cases satori it is said to be facilitated by violentsensations and even by physical pain. Its cause may be the mere perception of an object as wellas any event in ordinary life, provided a certain latent predisposition exists in the subject.Regarding this, some misunderstandings may occur. Suzuki acknowledged that \"generallyspeaking, there are no indications on the inner work preceding satori\". However, he talked aboutthe necessity of first going through \"a true baptism of fire\". After all, the very institution of theso-called \"Halls of Meditation\" (Zendo), where those who strive to obtain a satori submitthemselves to a regimen of life which is partially analogous to that of some Catholic religiousorders, bespeaks the necessity of a preliminary preparation. This preparation may last for severalyears. The essence of Zen seems to consist in a maturation process, identical to the one in whichone almost reaches a state of an acute existential instability. At that point, the slightest push issufficient to produce a change of state, a spiritual breakthrough, the opening which leads to the\"intuitive vision of one's nature\". The Masters know the moment in which the mind of thedisciple is mature and ready to open up; it is ten that they eventually give the final. Decisivepush. This push may sometimes consist of a simple gesture, an exclamation, in somethingapparently irrelevant, or even illogical and absurd. This suffices to induce the collapse of thefalse notion of individuality. Thus, satori replaces this notion with the \"normal state\", and oneassumes the \"original face, which one had before creation\". One no longer \"chases after echoes\"and \"shadows\". This under some aspects brings to mind the existential theme of \"failure\", or of\"being shipwrecked\" (das Scheitern, in Kierkegaard and in Jaspers). In fact, as I have mentioned,the opening often takes place when all the resources of one's being have been exhausted and onehas his back against the wall. This can be seen in relation to some practical teachings methodsused by Zen. The most frequently employed methods, on an intellectual plane, are the koan andthe mondo. The disciple is confronted with a saying or with questions which are paradoxical,absurd and sometimes even grotesque and \"surrealistic\". He must labor with his mind, ifnecessary for years, until he has reached the extreme limit of all his normal faculties ofcomprehension. Then, if he dares proceed further on that road he may find catastrophe, but if hecan turn the situation upside down, he may achieve metanoia. This is the point where satori isusually achieved.Zen's norm is that of absolute autonomy; no gods, no cults, no idols. To literally empty oneselfof everything, including God. \"If you meet Buddha on the road, kill him\", a saying goes. It isnecessary to abandon everything, without leaning on anything, and then to proceed forward, withone's essence, until the crisis point is reached. It is very difficult to say more about satori, or tocompare it with various forms of initiatory mystical experience whether Eastern or Western. Oneis supposed to spend only the training period in Zen monasteries. Once the disciple has achievedsatori, he return to the world, choosing a way of life that fits his need. One may think of satori asa form of transcendence which is brought to immanence, as a natural state, in every form of life.The behavior which proceeds from the newly acquired dimension, which is added to reality as aconsequence of satori, may well be summarized by Lao Tzu's expression: \"To be the whole inthe part\". In regard to this, it is important to realize the influence which Zen has exercised on theFar-Eastern way of life. Zen has been called \"the samurai's philosophy,\" and it had also been saidthat \"the way of Zen is identical to the way of archery,\" or to the \"way of the sword\". This meansthat any activity in one's life, may be permeated by Zen and thus be elevated to a highermeaning, to a \"wholesomeness\" and to an \"impersonal activity\". This kind of activity is based ona sense of the individual's irrelevance, which nevertheless does not paralyze one's actions, butwhich rather confers cam and detachment. This detachment, in turn, favors an absolute and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26\"pure\" undertaking of life, which in some cases reaches extreme and distinct forms of self-sacrifice and heroism, inconceivable to the majority of Westerners (e.g. the kamikaze in WWII).Thus, what C.G. Jung claims is simply ridiculous, namely that Psychoanalysis, more than anyother Western school of thought, is capable of understanding Zen. According to Jung, satoricoincides with the state of wholeness, devoid of complexes or inner splitting, whichpsychoanalytic treatment claims to achieve whenever the intellect's obstructions and its sense ofsuperiority are removed, and whenever the conscious dimension of the soul is reunited with theunconscious and with \"Life\". Jung did not realize that the methods and presuppositions of Zen,are exactly the opposite of his own. There is no \"subconscious\", as a distinct entity, to which theconscious has to be reconnected; Zen speaks of a superconscious vision (enlightenment, bodhi or\"awakening\"), which actualizes the \"original and luminous nature\" and which, in so doing,destroys the unconscious. It is possible though, to notice similarities between Jung's view's andZen', since they both talk about the feeling of one's \"totality\" and freedom which is manifested inevery aspect of life. However, it is important to explain the level at which these views appear tocoincide.Once Zen found its way to the West, there was a tendency to \"domesticate\" and to moralize it,playing down its potential radical and \"antinomian\" (namely, antithetical to current norms)implications, and by emphasizing the standard ingredients which are held so dear by \"spiritual\"people, namely love and service to one's neighbor, even though these ingredients have beenpurified in an impersonal and non-sentimental form. Generally speaking, there are many doubtson the \"practicability\" o f Zen, considering that the \"doctrine of the awakening\" has an initiatorycharacter.Thus, it will only be able to inspire a minority of people, in contrast to later Buddhist views,which took the form of a religion open to everyone, for the most part a code of mere morality. Asthe re-establishment of the spirit of early Buddhism, Zen should have strictly been an esotericdoctrine. It has been so as we can see by examining the legend concerning its origins. However,Suzuki himself was inclined to give a different account; he emphasized those aspects ofMahayana which \"democratize\" Buddhism (after all, the term Mahayana has been interpreted tomean \"Great Vehicle\", even in the sense that it extends to wider audiences, and not just to a fewelect). If one was to fully agree with Suzuki, some perplexities on the nature and on the scope ofsatori may arise. One should ask whether such an experience merely affects the psychological,moral or mental domain, or whether it affects the ontological domain, as is the case in everyauthentic initiation. In that event, it can only be the privilege a very restricted number of people.* Artículo aparecido originalmente en \"Lo Zen\", Roma, Fondazione Julius Evola, Quaderni ditesti evoliani, nº 15, 1981.

[...]Mythologization has naturally gone hand in hand with idealization, so that only the positiveaspects of the Fascist regime are highlighted, deliberately or unconsciously playing down thenegative ones. The same procedure is practiced the other way round by those who represent anti-nationalist forces, their mythologization leading to systematic denigration, the aspects with aview to discrediting it and making everyone hate it. [...]Over and above any polemical one-sidedness, those who, unlike the 'nostalgics' of the youngergeneration, have lived through Fascism and have thus had a direct experience of the system andits men, know and acknowledge that not everything about it was in order. As long as Fascismexisted and could be considered a movement of reconstruction in the making, one of yetunrealized and uncrystalized possibilities, it was still permissible not to criticize it beyond acertain limit. And those who, like ourselves, while defending a set of ideas which only partiallycoincided with Fascism (and with German National Socialism), did not condemn thesemovements, even though fully aware of their questionable or aberrant aspects, did so preciselybecause we counted on future possible developments--to be encouraged with every means andstrength we could muster--which might have corrected or eliminated these aspects.Today, when that Fascism lies behind us as a historical reality, or attitude cannot be the same.Instead of idealizing it in a way consistent with the 'myth' of Fascism, what is necessary now isto separate the positive from the negative, not just for theoretical reasons, but for practicalguidance with an eventual political struggle in mind. Thus we should not accept the adjective'fascist' or 'neo-fascist' tout court; we should call ourselves fascist (if we feel we must) in respectof what was positive about Fascism, not fascist in respect of what Fascism was not.[...]Even in the search for the positive, there is in practice an essential difference between on the onehand those whose only reference point is Fascism (or possible analogous movements of othernations--German National Socialism, Belgian Rexism, the early Falange in Spain, Salazar'sRegime, the Romanian Iron Guard: at one point it was possible to talk of a 'world revolution', ageneral movement of opposition to the proletarian revolution), seeing in it the be-all and end-allof their political, historical, and doctrinal horizons, and on the other those who consider whatemerged from such movements as particular manifestations, some more perfect than others, ofideas and principles based in that earlier Tradition of which we have spoken, but adapted toparticular circumstances. These principles are to be associated with 'normality' and permanence,relegating what is original and in the strict sense 'revolutionary' about those movements tosecondary, contingent traits. In other words, it is a question of making linkages as far as it ispossible between the great European political Tradition and discarding what at bottom can beseen as compromises, divergent or even deviant possibilities, or phenomena which were productsof the very evils which people set out to take a stand against and fight."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28Hitler and the Secret SocietiesBy Julius Evola (from Il Conciliatore, no. 10, 1971; translated from the German edition inDeutsche Stimme, no. 8, 1998)It is remarkable that some authors in France have researched the relationship of German NationalSocialism to secret societies and initiatic organizations. The motivation for this was the supposedoccult background of the Hitler movement. This thesis was first proposed in the well-known andvery far-fetched book by Pauwels and Bergier, \"Le Matin des Magiciens\" (English ed., \"TheDawn of Magic\"), in which National Socialism was defined as the union of \"magical thinking\"with technology. The expression used for this was \"Tank divisions plus René Guénon\": a phrasethat might well have caused that eminent representative of traditional thought and esotericdisciplines to turn indignantly in his grave.The first misunderstanding here is the confusion of the magical element with the mythical,whereas the two have nothing to do with one another. The role of myths in National Socialism isundeniable, for example in the idea of the Reich, the charismatic Führer, Race, Blood, etc. Butrather than calling these \"myths,\" one should apply to them Sorel's concept of \"motivatingenergy-ideas\" (which is what all the suggestive ideas used by demagogues commonly are), andnot attribute to them any magical ingredient. Similarly, no rational person thinks of magic inconnection with the myths of Fascism, such as the myth of Rome or that of the Duce, any morethan with those of the French Revolution or Communism. The investigation would proceeddifferently if one went on the assumption that certain movements, without knowing it, weresubject to influences that were not merely human. But this is not the case with the Frenchauthors. They are not thinking of influences of that kind, but of a concrete nature, exercised byorganizations that really existed, among which were some that to various degrees were \"secret.\"Likewise, some have spoken of \"unknown superiors\" who are supposed to have called forth theNational Socialist movement and to have used Hitler as a medium, though it is unclear whatgoals they could have had in mind in so doing. If one considers the results, the catastrophicconsequences to which National Socialism led, even indirectly, those goals must have beenobscure and destructive. One would have to identify the \"occult side\" of this movement withwhat Guénon called the \"Counter-Initiation.\" But the French authors have also proposed thethesis that Hitler the \"medium\" emancipated himself at a certain point from the \"unknownsuperiors,\" almost like a Golem, and that the movement then pursued its fatal direction. But inthat case one must admit that these \"unknown superiors\" can have had no prescience and verylimited power, to have been incapable of putting a stop to their supposed medium, Hitler.A lot of fantasy has been woven on the concrete level about the origin of National Socialism'sthemes and symbols. Reference has been made to certain organizations as forerunners, but onesto which it is very difficult to attribute any genuine and factual initiatic character. There is nodoubt that Hitler did not invent German racial doctrine, the symbol of the swastika, or Aryanantisemitism: all of these had long existed in Germany."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29A book entitled \"Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab\" [The man who gave Hitler his ideas]reports on Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels (the title of nobility was self-bestowed), who had formerlybeen a Cistercian monk and had founded an Order that already used the swastika; Lanz edited theperiodical \"Ostara\" from 1905 onwards, which Hitler certainly knew, in which the Aryan andantisemitic racial theories were already clearly worked out.But much more important for the \"occult background\" of National Socialism is the role of theThule Society. Things are more complex here. This society grew out of the Germanenorden,founded in 1912, and was led by Rudolf von Sebottendorf, who had been in the East and hadpublished a strange booklet on \"Die Praxis der alten türkischen Freimaurerei\" [The practice ofancient Turkish Freemasonry]. Practices were described therein that involved the repetition ofsyllables, gestures, and steps, whose goal was the initiatic transformation of man, such asalchemy had also aimed at. It is unclear what Turkish masonic organization Sebottendorf was incontact with, and also whether he himself practiced the things in question, or merely describedthem.Moreover, it cannot be established whether these practices were employed in the Thule Societythat Sebottendorf headed. It would be very important to know that, because many top-rankingNational Socialist personalities, from Hitler to Rudolf Hess, frequented this society. In a way,Hitler was already introduced to the world of ideas of the Thule Society by Hess during theirimprisonment together after the failed Munich Putsch.At all events, it must be emphasized that the Thule Society was less an initiatic organization thanit was a secret society, which already bore the swastika and was marked by a decidedantisemitism and by Germanic racial thinking. One should be cautious about the thesis that thename Thule is a serious and conscious reference to a Nordic, Polar connection, in the effort tomake a connection with the Hyperborean origins of the Indo-Germans--since Thule appears inancient tradition as the sacred center or sacred island in the uttermost North. Thule may just be aplay on the name \"Thale,\" a location in the Harz where the Germanenorden held a conference in1914, at which it was decided to create a secret \"völkisch\" band to combat the supposed JewishInternational. Above all, these ideas were emphasized by Sebottendorf in his book \"Bevor Hitlerkam\" [Before Hitler came], published in Munich in 1933, in which he indicated the myths andthe \"völkisch\" world-view that existed before Hitler.Thus a serious investigation into Hitler's initiatic connections with secret societies does not leadfar. A few explanations are necessary in regard to Hitler as a \"medium\" and his attractive power.It seems to us pure fantasy that he owed this power to initiatic practices. Otherwise one wouldhave to assume the same about the psychic power of other leaders, like Mussolini and Napoleon,which is absurd. It is much better to go on the assumption that there is a psychic vortex thatarises from mass movements, and that this concentrates on the man in the center and lends him acertain radiation that is felt especially by suggestible people.The quality of medium (which, to put it bluntly, is the antithesis of an initiatic qualification) canbe attributed to Hitler with a few reservations, because in a certain respect he did appear as onepossessed (which differentiates him from Mussolini, for example). When he whipped up themasses to fanaticism, one had the impression that another force was directing him as a medium,even though he was a man of a very extraordinary kind, and extremely gifted. Anyone who hasheard Hitler's addresses to the enraptured masses can have no other impression."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30Since we have already expressed our reservations about the assumption that \"unknownsuperiors\" were involved, it is not easy to define the nature of this supra-personal force. Inrespect to National Socialist theosophy [Gotteserkenntnis], i.e. to its supposed mystical andmetaphysical dimension, one must realize the unique juxtaposition in this movement and in theThird Reich of mythical, Enlightenment, and even scientific aspects. In Hitler, one can find manysymptoms of a typically \"modern\" world-view that was fundamentally profane, naturalistic, andmaterialistic; while on the other hand he believed in Providence, whose tool he believed himselfto be, especially in regard to the destiny of the German nation. (For example, he saw a sign ofProvidence in his survival of the assassination attempt in his East-Prussian headquarters.)Alfred Rosenberg, the ideologist of the movement, proclaimed the myth of Blood, in which hespoke of the \"mystery\" of Nordic blood and attributed to it a sacramental value; yet hesimultaneously attacked all the rites and sacraments of Catholicism as delusions, just like a manof the Enlightenment. He railed against the \"Dark men of our time,\" while attributing to Aryanman the merit of having created modern science. National Socialism's concern with runes, theancient Nordic-Germanic letter-signs, must be regarded as purely symbolic, rather like theFascist use of certain Roman symbols, and without any esoteric significance. The program ofNational Socialism to create a higher man has something of \"biological mysticism\" about it, butthis again was a scientific project. At best, it might have been a question of the \"superman\" inNietzsche's sense, but never of a higher man in the initiatic sense.The plan to \"create a new racial, religious, and military Order of initiates, assembled around adivinized Führer,\" cannot be regarded as the official policy of National Socialism, as RenéAlleau writes, when he presents such a relationship and even compares it, among others, to theIshmaelites of Islam. A few elements of a higher level were visible only in the ranks of the SS.In the first place, one can see clearly the intention of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler tocreate an Order in which elements of Prussian ethics were to be combined with those of the oldOrders of knighthood, especially the Teutonic Order. He was looking for legitimation of such anorganization, but could not obtain it, since these old Orders of Catholicism were openly opposedby the radical wing of National Socialism. Himmler was also seeking, without the possibility ofany traditional connection, a relationship to the Nordic-Hyperborean heritage and its symbolism(Thule), albeit without those \"secret societies\" discussed above having any influence over it. Hetook notice, as did Rosenberg, of the researches of the Netherlander Herman Wirth into theNordic-Atlantic tradition. Later Himmler founded, with Wirth, the research and teachingorganization called the \"Ahnenerbe.\" This is not without interest, but there was no \"occultbackground\" to it.So the net result is negative. The French authors' fantasy reaches its high point in the book\"Hitler et la tradition cathare\" by Jean-Michel Angebert (Paris, 1971). This deals with theCathars, also called Albigensians, who were a heretical sect that spread especially in SouthernFrance between the 11th and 12th centuries, and had their center in the fortress of Montségur.According to Otto Rahn, this was destroyed in a \"crusade against the Grail,\" which is the title ofone of his books. Whatever the Grail and its Grail-Knights had to do with this sect remainscompletely in the dark. The sect was marked by a kind of fanatical Manicheism: sometimes itsown believers would die of hunger or some other cause as a demonstration of their detachmentfrom the world and their hostility to earthly existence in flesh and matter. Now it is assumed thatRahn, with whom we corresponded during his lifetime and tried to persuade of the baselessnessof his thesis, was an SS man, and that an expedition was sent on its way to retrieve the legendaryGrail which was supposedly brought to safety at the moment when the Cathars' fortress in"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31Montségur was destroyed.

Two further examplesshow what such fantasies can lead to when they are given free rein.

For Evola and other proponents of Traditionalism, we are now living inan age of increasing strife and chaos: the Kali Yuga of the Hindus or the Germanic Ragnarok. Insuch a time, social decadence is so widespread that it appears as a natural component of allpolitical institutions. Evola argues that the crises that dominate the daily lives of our societies arepart of a secret occult war to remove the support of spiritual and traditional values in order toturn man into a passive instrument of the powerful.Evola is often regarded as the godfather of contemporary Italian fascism and right-wing radicalpolitics, but attentive examination of the historical record--as provided by H.

Though he heldextreme right-wing views, he was a fearless critic of the Fascist regime and preferred a castesystem based on spirituality and intellect to the biological racism championed by the Nazis.Ultimately, he viewed the forces of history as comprised by two factions: \"history's demolitionsquad\" enslaved by blind faith in the future and those individuals whose watchword is Tradition.These latter stand in this world of ruins at a higher level and are capable of letting go of whatneeds to be abandoned in order that what is truly essential not be compromised.Reviews“Disgusted by the cruelty and artificiality of communism, scorning the dogmatic, self-centeredfascism of his age, Evola looks beyond man-made systems to the eternal principles in creationand human society.

Men among the Ruins is not a work for complacent, self-satisfiedminds . . . it is a shocking and humbling text that will be either loved or hated. Evola’s enemiescannot refute him; they can only ignore him. They do so at their peril.” - Glenn A. Magee, authorof Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34Excerpt from chapter 13, \"The Occult War\"Various causes have been adduced to explain the crisis that has affected and still affects the lifeof modern peoples: historical, social, socioeconomic, political, moral, and cultural causes,according to different perspectives. The part played by each of these causes should not bedenied. However, we need to ask a higher and essential question: are these always the firstcauses and do they have an inevitable character like those causes found in the material world?Do they supply an ultimate explanation or, in some cases, is it necessary to identify influences ofa higher order, which may cause what has occurred in the West to appear very suspicious, andwhich, beyond the multiplicity of individual aspects, suggest that there is the same logic at work?The concept of occult war must be defined within the context of the dilemma. The occult war is abattle that is waged imperceptibly by the forces of global subversion, with means and incircumstances ignored by current historiography. The notion of occult war belongs to a three-dimensional view of history: this view does not regard as essential the two superficialdimensions of time and space (which include causes, facts, and visible leaders) but ratheremphasizes the dimension of depth, or the \"subterranean\" dimension in which forces andinfluences often act in a decisive manner, and which, more often not than not, cannot be reducedto what is merely human, whether at an individual or a collective level.Having said that, it is necessary to specify the meaning of the term \"subterranean.\" We shouldnot think, in this regard, of a dark and irrational background which stands in relation to theknown forces of history as the unconscious stands to consciousness, in the way the latterrelationship is discussed in the recently developed \"Depth Psychology.\" If anything, we can talkabout the unconscious only in regard to those who, according to the three-dimensional view,appear to be history's objects rather than its subjects, since in their thoughts and conduct they arescarcely aware of the influences which they obey and the goals that they contribute towardachieving. In these people, the center falls more in the unconscious and the pre-conscious than inthe clear reflected consciousness, no matter what they-who are often men of action andideologues-believe. Considering this relation, we can say that the most decisive actions of theoccult war take place in the human unconscious. However, if we consider the true agents ofhistory in the special aspects we are now discussing, things are otherwise: here we cannot talk ofthe subconscious or the unconscious, since we are dealing with intelligent forces that know verywell what they want and what are the means most suited to achieve their objectives.The third dimension of history should not be diluted in the fog of abstract philosophical orsociological concepts, but should rather be thought of as a \"backstage\" dimension where specific\"intelligences\" are at work.An investigation of the secret history that aspires to be positivist and scientific should not be toolofty or removed from reality. However, it is necessary to assume as the ultimate reference pointa dualistic scheme not dissimilar from the one found in an older tradition. Catholichistoriography used to regard history not only as a mechanism of natural, political, economic,and social causes, but also as the unfolding of divine Providence, to which hostile forces areopposed. These forces are sometimes referred to in a moralistic fashion as \"forces of evil,\" or in atheological fashion as the \"forces of the Anti-Christ.\" Such a view has a positive content,provided it is purified and emphasized by bringing it to a less religious and more metaphysicalplane, as was done in Classical and Indo-European antiquity: forces of the cosmos against forcesof chaos."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35To the former correspond everything that is form, order, law, spiritual hierarchy, and tradition inthe higher sense of the word; to the latter correspond every influence that disintegrates, subverts,degrades, and promotes the predominance of the inferior over the superior, matter over spirit,quantity over quality. This is what can be said in regard to the ultimate reference points of thevarious influences that act upon the realm of tangible causes, behind known history. These mustbe taken into account, though with some prudence. Let me repeat: aside from this necessarymetaphysical background, let us never lose sight of concrete history.Methodologically speaking, we need to be careful to prevent valid insights from degeneratinginto fantasies and superstition, and not develop the tendency to see an occult backgroundeverywhere and at all costs. In this regard, every assumption we make must have the character ofwhat are called \"working hypotheses\" in scientific research: as when something is admittedprovisionally, thus allowing the gathering and arranging of a group of apparently isolated facts,only to confer on them a character not of hypothesis but of truth when, at the end of a seriousinductive work, the data converge in validating the original assumption. Every time an effectoutlasts and transcends its tangible causes, a suspicion should arise, and a positive or negativeinfluence behind the stages should be perceived. A problem is posited, but in analyzing it andseeking its solution, prudence must be exercised. The fact that those who have ventured in thisdirection have not restrained their wild imaginations has discredited what could have been ascience, the results of which could hardly be overestimated. This too meets the expectations ofthe hidden enemy.After considering the state of society and modern civilization, one should ask if this is not aspecific case that requires the application of this method; in other words, one should ask whethersome situations of real crisis and radical subversion in the modern world can be satisfactorilyexplained through \"natural\" and spontaneous processes, or whether we need to refer tosomething that has been concerted, namely a still unfolding plan, devised by forces hiding in theshadows."}]
