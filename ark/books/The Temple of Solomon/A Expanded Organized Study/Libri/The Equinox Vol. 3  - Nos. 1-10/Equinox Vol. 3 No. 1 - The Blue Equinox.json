From the blasted stump of dogma, the poison oak of ìoriginal sin,î is hanged the hag with dyed and bloody hair, Christianity, the glyph thus commemorating ìsa vie horizontale et sa mort verticale.î The satyr, a portrait of Frater D.D.S., one of the Teachers of the Master Therion, represents the Soul of the New Aeon, whose Word is Do what thou wilt; for the satyr is the True Nature of every man and every woman; and every man and every woman is a star.

This truth is of two orders: one, concerning Nature external to Man; two, concerning Nature internal to Man. Existing religions, especially Christianity, are based on primitive ignorance of the facts, particularly of external Nature. Celebrations must conform to the custom and nature of the people. Christianity has destroyed the joyful celebrations, characterised by music, dancing, feasting and making love, and has kept only the melancholy. The Law of Thelema offers a religion which fulfills all necessary conditions. The philosophy and metaphysics of Thelema are sound, and offer a solution of the deepest problems of humanity. The science of Thelema is orthodox; is has no false theories of Nature, no false fables of the origin of things. The psychology and ethics of Thelema are perfect. It has destroyed the damnable delusion of Original Sin, making every one unique, independent, supreme and sufficient. The Law of Thelema is given in the Book of the Law [Equinox I, VII and X]. The Equinox has been founded to promulgate and demon-strate this Law."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 The A∴A∴, or Great White Brotherhood, through Whom this Law was obtained, is a Body of the highest Initiates, pledged to aid mankind. It offers instruction in the Way of Spiritual Progress and Illumination to individual seekers. The work of the A∴A∴ is called Scientific Illuminism. This may be briefly expressed by quoting Its motto: ìThe method of Science: the aim of Religion.î Each seeker is taught how to realise Truth for himself, by means accurate and well-tested. The O.T.O. is the first of the great religious Societies to accept the Law. It trains groups by way of progressive initiation. The Equinox publishes all instructions and pronouncements of the A∴A∴ and O.T.O. It also publishes such poetry, drama, fiction, and essays, as are sympathetic to this programme, so far as space permits. The Equinox is so called, firstly because it is the comment upon the Word of the New ∆on, qelhma, which was given at the Equinox of the Gods, when the Crowned and Conquering Child, Horus, took the place of the Dying God, Osiris. (The Equinox marks a period of a fresh influx of Force from our Father the SUN.) Secondly, in accordance with this, publication takes place at the Equinoxes of Spring and Autumn of each year. The rule of the A∴A∴ is to alternate 5 years of silence with 5 years of speech. Hence publication has been from 1909-1914, An V-IX; and now from 1919-1924, An XV-XIX. Love is the law, love under will. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 11 A∴A∴ PR∆MONSTRANCE A MANIFESTO OF THE GREAT WHITE BROTHERHOOD Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. The PrÊmonstrator of the A∴A∴ wishes it to be known that the period of silence, which (according to the Rule of the Order) lasts during every alternate five years, will end at the Equinox of Spring in the year 1919 of the vulgar era. He wishes to call attention to the general principles of the Great White Brotherhood, which is also known as the A∴A∴. Primarily, this Body exists for the purpose of conferring Initiation. Secondarily, it prepares people for Initiation by means of courses of instruction. These courses are divided into two main parts, theoretical and practical. Information with regard to both these courses. The Order issues printed books of instruction. They cover the classics of all previous systems, and explain the parti-cular system of A∴A∴. These instructions are issued in an extremely comprehensive and well-ordered form. Every instruction has been edited on strictly scientific lines. Stu-dents are thoroughly drilled in this work; examations take place regularly, and diplomas issued to those who pass them."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 12 The instruction of the A∴A∴ is therefore as precise and definite as a University course. During the five years of speech from the Equinox of Spring 1909 of the vulgar era, 65 different books were issued, nearly all of these being printed in the 10 numbers of Volume I of the Equinox. Volume I of the Equinox is now very rare and expensive. Only a few sets remain; and these are valued at $100 per set. When these have been sold, it is proposed to re-publish the Official Instructions referred to above in separate form, for the benefit of those students who have been disappointed in obtaining sets of Volume I of the Equinox. The A∴A∴ will publish a new volume of the Equinox in 10 numbers at intervals of six months, beginning with the Equinox of Spring (March 23) of the vulgar year of 1919. The principal items of the new promulgation are as follows: LIBER CCXX. THE BOOK OF THE LAW, which is the foundation of our whole work, and the commentary thereon by the Master through whom it was given to the world. LIBER LXI. A manuscript giving an account of the history of the A∴A∴ in recent times. This history contains no mythology: it is a statement of facts susceptible of rational proof. LIBER CL. DE LEGE LIBELLUM.

It is proposed to continue the same policy with regard to the new volume. Owing to the war, the cost of printing both for the paper required and the labour involved has gone up to an unprecedented degree, but the PrÊmonstrator of the A∴A∴ is determined that he will not allow these matters to interfere with his programme of putting out the Equinox in a style worthy of its contents. The new volume of ten numbers, averaging 400 pages, will not be inferior to the old in any way either with regard to paper or printing; that is to say, it will be produced in the best possible manner, and will be of permanent value for a library. The general appearance will be uniform with the last volume, but the binding will be of improved quality.

The grades themselves represent magical and mystical progress, corresponding to which will be grades of studentship representing intellectual progress, and an examination in each grade must be passed before the equivalent magical grade is officially conferred. It must be understood that the highest occult attainments are possible even to people who have no intellectual knowledge whatever. But this has been in the past a source of great iniquity, as it represents an overdevelopment of one organ of the Nature at the expense of others. It is the particular object of the A∴A∴ to see to it that progress is orderly and thorough. It must further be stated that although certain books have been chosen for particular study, the student is not thereby absolved from the general study of all of them. For it is important to him to make from the beginning a comprehensive effort to understand the entire system, first, because it is desirable that he should choose his practices from the whole armoury at his disposal, and, also, because as he advances he must to be some extent familiar with all these practices, so that he may be fitted to instruct those entrusted to his guidance."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CURRICULUM OF A∴A∴ 19 COURSE I GENERAL READING SECTION 1.

He should make a critical exam-ination of them; not so much with the idea of discovering where the truth lies, for he cannot do this except by virtue of his own spiritual experience, but rather to discover the essential harmony in those varied works. He should be on his guard against partisanship with a favourite author. He should familiarize himself thoroughly with the method of mental equilibrium, endeavouring to contradict any state-ment soever, although it may be apparently axiomatic. The general object of this course, besides that already stated, is to assure sound education in occult matters, so that when spiritual illumination comes it may find a well-built temple. When the mind is strongly biased towards any special theory, the result of an illumination is often to inflame that portion of the mind which is thus overdeveloped, with the result that the aspirant, instead of becoming an Adept, becomes a bigot and fanatic.

Every act that is not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must not be two, but one. Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained above, but also ìunassuaged of purposeî. This strange phrase must give us pause. It may mean that any purpose in the will would damp it; clearly, the ìlust of resultî is a thing from which it must be delivered. But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read ìwith purpose unassuagedîói.e. with tireless energy. The conception is, therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of staticóand this comes to the same thing in the end. The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover what his will really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this by the practices of Liber Thisharb (see Equinox I, VII, 105) or such others as may from one time to another be appointed. It should now be perfectly simple for everybody to understand the Message of the Master Therion. Thou must (1) Find out what is thy Will, (2) Do that Will with (a) one-pointedness, (b) detachment, (c) peace. Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Move-ment of Things, thy will part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since the will is but the dynamic aspect of the self, and since two different selves could not possess identical wills; then, if thy will be Godís will, Thou art That.

Lo, while in the Book of the Law is much Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost like Love! Fighting most certainly is Love! ìAs brothers fight ye!î All the manly races of the world understand this. The Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile, even orgiastic.

THE HISTORY LECTION 7. Some years ago a number of cipher MSS. were discovered and deciphered by certain students. They attracted much attention, as they purported to derive from the Rosicrucians. You will readily understand that the genuineness of the claim matters no whit, such literature being judged by itself, not by its reputed sources. 8. Among the MSS. was one which gave the address of a certain person in Germany, who is known to us as S.D.A. Those who discovered the ciphers wrote to S.D.A., and in accordance with instructions received, an Order was founded which worked in a semi-secret manner. 9. After some time S.D.A. died: further requests for help were met with a prompt refusal from the colleagues of S.D.A. It was written by one of them that S.D.A.ís scheme had always been regarded with disapproval. But since the absolute rule of the adepts is never to interfere with the judgements of any other person whomsoeveróhow much more, then, one of themselves, and that one most highly revered!óthey had refrained from active opposition. The adept who wrote this added that the Order had already quite"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"LIBER LXI 57 enough knowledge to enable it or its members to formulate a magical link with the adepts. 10. Shortly after this, one called S.R.M.D. announced that he had formulated such a link, and that himself and two others were to govern the Order. New and revised rituals were issued, and fresh knowledge poured out in streams. 11. We must pass over the unhappy juggleries which characterised the next period. It has throughout proved impossible to elucidate the complex facts. We content ourselves, then, with observing that the death of one of his two colleagues, and the weakness of the other, secured to S.R.M.D. the sole authority. The rituals were elaborated, though scholarly enough, into verbose and pretentious nonsense: the knowledge proved worthless even where it was correct: for it is in vain that pearls, be they never to clear and precious, are given to the swine. The ordeals were turned into contempt, it being impossible for anyone to fail therein. Unsuitable candidates were admitted for no better reason than that of their worldly prosperity. In short, the Order failed to initiate. 12. Scandal arose, and with it schism. 13. In 1900, one P., a brother, instituted a rigorous test of S.R.M.D. on the one side and the Order on the other. 14. He discovered that S.R.M.D., though a scholar of some ability and a magician of remarkable powers, had never attained complete initiation: and further had fallen from his original place, he having imprudently attracted to himself forces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 58 The claim of the Order that the true adepts were in charge of it was definitely disproved. 15. In the Order, with two certain exceptions and two doubtful ones, he found no persons prepared for initiation of any sort. 16. He thereupon by his subtle wisdom destroyed both the Order and its chief. 17. Being himself no perfect adept, he was driven of the Spirit into the Wilderness, where he abode for six years, studying by the light of reason the sacred books and secret systems of all countries and ages. 18. Finally, there was given unto him a certain exalted grade whereby a man becomes master of knowledge and intelligence, and no more their slave. He perceived the inadequacy of science, philosophy, and religion; and exposed the self-contradictory nature of the thinking faculty. 19. Returning to England, he laid his achievements humbly at the feet of a certain adept D.D.S., who welcomed him brotherly and admitted his title to the grade which he had so hardly won. 20. Thereupon these two adepts conferred together, saying: May it not be written that the tribulations shall be shortened? Wherefore they resolved to establish a new Order which should be free from the errors and deceits of the former one. 21. Without Authority they could not do this, exalted as their rank was among adepts. They resolved to prepare all things, great and small, against that day when such Authority should be received by them, since they knew not where to seek for higher adepts than themselves, but knew that the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"LIBER LXI 59 true way to attract the notice of such was to equilibrate the symbols. The temple must be builded before the God can indwell it. 22. Therefore by the order of D.D.S. did P. prepare all things by his arcane science and wisdom, choosing only those symbols which were common to all systems, and rigorously rejecting all names and words which might be supposed to imply any religious or metaphysical theory. To do this utterly was found impossible, since all language has a history, and the use (for example) of the word ìspiritî implies the Scholastic Philosophy and the Hindu and Taoist theories concerning the breath of man. So was it difficult to avoid implication of some undesirable bias by using the words ìorder,î ìcircle,î ìchapter,î ìsociety,î ìbrotherhood,î or any other to designate the body of imitates. 23. Deliberately, therefore, did he take refuge in vague-ness. Not to veil the truth to the Neophyte, but to warn him against valuing non-essentials. Should therefore the candidate hear the name of any God, let him not rashly assume that it refers to any known God, save only the God known to himself. Or should the ritual speak in terms (however vague) which seem to imply Egyptian, Taoist, Buddhist, Indian, Persian, Greek, Judaic, Christian or Moslem philosophy, let him reflect that this is a defect of language, the literary limitation and not the spiritual prejudice of the man P. 24. Especially let him guard against the finding of definite sectarian symbols in the teaching of his master, and the reasoning from the known to the unknown which assuredly will tempt him."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 60 We labour earnestly, dear brother, that you may never be led away to perish upon this point; for thereon have many holy and just men been wrecked. By this have all the visible systems lost the essence of wisdom. We have sought to reveal the Arcanum; we have only profaned it. 25. Now when P. had thus with bitter toil prepared all things under the guidance of D.D.S. (even as the hand writes, while the conscious brain, though ignorant of the detailed movements, applauds or disapproves the finished work) there was a certain period of repose, as the earth lieth fallow. 26. Meanwhile these adepts busied themselves intently with the Great Work. 27. In the fullness of time, even as a blossoming tree that beareth fruit in its season, all these pains were ended, and these adepts and their companions obtained the reward which they had soughtóthey were to be admitted to the Eternal and Invisible Order that hath no name among men. 28. They therefore who had with smiling faces abandoned their homes, their possessions, their wives, their children, in order to perform the Great Work, could with steady calm and firm correctness abandon the Great Work itself; for this is the last and greatest projection of the alchemist. 29. Also one V.V.V.V.V. arose, an exalted adept of the rank of Master of the Temple (or this much He disclosed to the Exempt Adepts) and His utterance is enshrined in the Sacred Writings. 30.

IN RIGHTEOUSNESS OF HEART come hither, and listen: for it is I, TO MEGA QHRION, who gave this Law unto everyone that holdeth himself holy. It is I, not another, that willeth your whole Freedom, and the arising within you of full Knowledge and Power. Behold! the Kingdom of God is within you, even as the Sun standeth eternal in the heavens, equal at midnight and at noon. He riseth not: he setteth not: it is but the shadow of the earth which concealeth him, or the clouds upon her face. Let me then declare unto you the Mystery of this Law, as it hath been made known unto me in divers places, upon the mountains and in the deserts, but also in great cities, which thing I speak unto you for your comfort and good courage. And so be it unto all of you. Know first, that from the Law spring four Rays or Emanations: so that if the Law be the centre of your own being, they must needs fill you with their secret goodness. And these four are Light, Life, Love, and Liberty."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 102 By Light shall ye look upon yourselves, and behold All Things that are in Truth One Thing only, whose name hath been called No Thing for a cause which later shall be declared unto you. But the substance of Light is Life, since without Existence and Energy it were naught. By Life therefore are you made yourselves, eternal and incorruptible, flaming forth as suns, self-created and self-supported, each the sole centre of the Universe. Now by the Light ye beheld, by Love ye feel. There is an ecstacy of pure Knowledge, and another of pure Love. And this Love is the force that uniteth things diverse, for the contemplation in Light of their Oneness. Know that the Universe is not at rest, but in extreme motion whose sum is Rest. And this understanding that Stability is Change, and Change Stability, that Being is Becoming, and Becoming Being, is the Key to the Golden Palace of this Law. Lastly, by Liberty is the power to direct your course according to your Will. For the extent of the Univese is without bounds, and ye are free to make your pleasure as ye will, seeing that the diversity of being is infinite also. For this also is the Joy of the Law, that no two stars are alike, and ye must understand also that this Multiplicity is itself Unity, and without it Unity could not be. And this is an hard saying against Reason: ye shall comprehend, when, rising above Reason, which is but a manipulation of the Mind, ye come to pure Knowledge by direct perception of the Truth. Know also that these four Emanations of the Law flame forth upon all paths: ye shall use them not only in these Highways of the Universe whereof I have written, but in every By-path of your daily life. Love is the law, love under Will."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 103 I OF LIBERTY IT IS OF LIBERTY that I would first write unto you, for except ye be free to act, ye cannot act. Yet all four gifts of the Law must in some degree be exercised, seeing that these four are one. But for the Aspirant that cometh unto the Master, the first need is freedom. The great bond of all bonds is ignorance. How shall a man be free to act if he know not his own purpose? You must therefore first of all discover which star of all the stars you are, your relation to the other stars about you, and your relation to, and identity with, the Whole. In our Holy Books are given sundry means of making this discovery, and each must make it for himself, attaining absolute conviction by direct experience, not merely reasoning and calculating what is probably. And to each will come the knowledge of his finite will, whereby one is a poet, one prophet, one worker in steel, another in jade. But also to each the knowledge of his infinite Will, his destiny to perform the Great Work, the realization of his True Self. Of this Will let me therefore speak clearly unto all, since it pertaineth unto all. Understand now that in yourselves is a certain discontent. Analyse well its nature: at the end is in every case one conclusion. The ill springs from the belief in two things, the Self and the Not-Self, and the conflict between them.

Ultimately, therefore, the problem is how to destroy this perception of duality, to attain to the apprehension of unity. Now then let us suppose that you have come to the Master, and that He has declared to you the Way of this attainment. What hindereth you? Alas! there is yet much Freedom afar off. Understand clearly this: that if you are sure of your Will, and sure of your means, then any thoughts or actions which are contrary to those means are contrary also to that Will. If therefore the Master should enjoin upon you a Vow of Holy Obedience, compliance is not a surrender of the Will, but a fulfilment thereof. For see, what hindereth you? It is either from without or from within, or both. It may be easy for the strong-minded seeker to put his heel upon public opinion, or to tear from his heart the objects which he loves, in a sense: but there will always remain in himself many discordant affections, as also the bond of habit, and these also must he conquer. In our holiest Book it is written: ìThou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.î Write it also in your heart and in your brain: for this is the key of the whole matter. Here Nature herself be your preacher: for in every phenomenon of force and motion doth she proclaim aloud this truth. Even in so small a matter as driving a nail into a plank, hear this same sermon. Your nail must be hard, smooth, fine-pointed, or it will not move swiftly in the direction willed. Imagine then a nail of tinder-wood with twenty pointsóit is verily no longer a nail.

Even thus, were a man sitting in a theatre where the play wearies him, he would welcome every distraction, and find amusement in any accident: but if he were intent upon the play, every such incident would annoy him. His attitude to these is then an indication of his attitude towards the play itself. At first the habit of attention is hard to acquire. Persevere, and you will have spasms of revulsion periodically. Reason itself will attack you, saying: how can so strict a bondage be the Path of Freedom? Persevere. You have never yet known Liberty. When the temptations are overcome, the voice of Reason silenced, then will your soul bound forward unhampered upon its chosen course, and for the first time will you experience the extreme delight of being Master of Yourself, and therefore of the Universe. When this is fully attained, when you sit securely in the saddle, then you may enjoy also all those distractions which first pleased you and then angered you. Now they will do neither any more: for they are your slaves and toys. Until you have reached this point, you are not wholly free. You must kill out desire, and kill out fear.

Now Love is the enkindling in ecstasy of Two that will to become One. It is thus an Universal formula of High Magick. For see now how all things, being in sorrow caused by dividuality, must of necessity will Oneness as their medicine. Here also is Nature monitor to them that seek Wisdom at her breast: for in the uniting of elements to opposite polarities is there a glory of heat, of light, and of electricity. Thus also in mankind do we behold the spritual fruit of poetry and all genius, arising from the seed of what is but an animal gesture, in the estimation of such as are schooled in Philosophy. And it is to be noted strongly that the most violent and divine passions are those between people of utterly unharmonious natures. But now I would have you know that in the mind are no such limitations in respect of species as prevent a man falling in love with an inanimate object, or an idea. For to him that is in any wise advanced upon the Way of Meditation it appears that all objects save the One Object are distasteful, even as appeared formerly in respect of his chance wishes to the Will. So therefore all objects must be grasped with the mind, and heated in the sevenfold furnace of Love, until with explosion of ecstasy they unite, and disappear, for they, being imperfect, are destroyed utterly in the creation of the Perfection of Union, even as the persons of the Lover and the Beloved are fused into the spiritual gold of Love, which knoweth no person, but comprehendeth all. Yet since each star is but one star, and the coming together of any two is but one partial rapture, so must the aspirant to"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 109 our holy Science and Art increase constantly by this method of assimilating ideas, that in the end, become capable of apprehending the Universe in one thought, he may leap forth upon It with the massed violence of his Self, and destroying both these, become that Unity whose name is No Thing. Seek ye all therefore constantly to unite yourselves in rapture with each and every thing that is, and that by utmost passion and lust of Union. To this end take chiefly all such things as are naturally repulsive. For what is pleasant is assimilated easily and without ecstasy: it is in the transfiguration of the loathsome and abhorred into The Beloved that the Self is shaken to the root in Love. Thus in human love also we see that mediocrities among men mate with null women: but History teacheth us that the supreme masters of the world seek ever the vilest and most horrible creatures for their concubines, overstepping even the limitig laws of sex and species in their necessity to transcend normality. It is not enough in such natures to excite lust or passion: the imagination itself must be inflamed by every means. For us, then, emancipated from all base law, what shall we do to satisfy our Will to Unity? No less a mistress than the Universe: no lupanar more cramped than Infinite Space: no night of rape that is not coeval with Eternity! Consider that as Love is mighty to bring forth all Ecstasy, so absence of Love is the greatest craving. Whoso is balked in Love sufereth indeed, but he that hath not actively that passion in his heart towards some object is weary with the ache of craving. And this state is called mystically ìDryness.î For this there is, as I believe, no cure but patient persistence in a Rule of Life."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 110 But this Dryness hath its virtue, in that thereby the soul is purged of those things that impreach the Will: for when the drouth is altogether perfect, then it is certain that by no means can the Soul be satisfied, save by the Accomplishment of the Great Work. And this is in strong souls a stimulus to the Will. It is the Furnace of Thirst that burneth up all dross within us. But to each act of Will is a particular Dryness corresponding: and as Love increaseth within you, so does the torment of His absence. Be this also unto you for a consolation in the ordeal! Moreover, the more fierce the plague of impotence, the more swiftly and suddenly is it wont to abate. Here is the method of Love in Meditation. Let the Aspirant first practice and then discipline himself in the Art of fixing the attention on any thing whatsoever at will, without permitting the least imaginable distraction. Let him also practice the art of the Analysis of Ideas, and that of refusing to allow the mind its natural reaction to them, pleasant or unpleasant, thus fixing himself in Simplicity and Indifference. These things being achieved in their ripe season, be it known to you that all ideas will have become equal to your apprehension, since each is simple and each indifferent: any one of them remaining in the mind at Will without stirring or striving, or tending to pass on to any other. But each idea will possess one special quality common to all: this, that no one of any of them is The Self, inasmuch as it is perceived by The Self as Something Opposite. When this is thorough and profound in the impact of its realization, then is the moment for the aspirant to direct his Will to Love upon it, so that his whole consciousness findeth"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 111 focus upon that One Idea. And at the first it may be fixed and dead, or lightly held. This may then pass into dryness, or into repulsion. Then at last by pure persistence in that Act of Will to Love, shall Love himself arise, as a bird, as a flame, as a song, and the whole Soul shall wing a fiery path of music unto the Ultimate Heaven of Possession. Now in this method there are many roads and ways, some simple and direct, some hidden and mysterious, even as it is with human love whereof no man hath made so much as the first sketches for a Map: for Love is infinite in diversity even as are the Stars. For this cause do I leave Love himself master in the heart of every one of you: for he shall teach you rightly if you but serve him with diligence and devotion even to abandonment. Nor shall you take umbrage at the strange pranks that he shall play: for He is a wayward boy and wanton, wise in the Wiles of Aphrodite Our Lady His sweet Mother: and all His jests and cruelties are spices in a confection cunning as no art may match. Rejoice therefore in all His play, not remitting in any wise your own ardour, but glowing with the sting of His whips, and making of Laughter itself a sacrament adjuvant to Love, even as in the Wine of Rheims is sparkle and bite, like as they were ministers to the High Priest of Intoxication. It is also fit that I write to you of the importance of Purity in Love. Now this matter concerneth not in any wise the object or the method of the practice: the one thing essential is that no alien element should intrude. And this is of most particular pertinence to the aspirant in that primary and mundane aspect of his work wherein he establisheth himself in the method through his natural affections."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 112 For know, that all things are masks or symbols of the One Truth, and nature serveth alway to point out the higher perfection under the veil of the lower perfection. So then all the Art and Craft of human love shall serve you as an hieroglyphic: for it is written that That which is above is like that which is below: and That which is below is like that which is above. Therefore also doth it behoove you to take well heed lest in any manner you fail in this business of purity. For though each act is to be complete on its own plane, and no influence of any other plane is to be brought in for interference or admixture, for that such is all impurity, yet each act should in itself be so complete and perfect that it is a mirror of the perfection of every plane, and thereby becometh partaker of the pure Light of the highest. Also, since all acts are to be acts of Will in Freedom on every plane, all planes are in reality but one: and thus the lowest expression of any function of that Will is to be at the same time an expression of the highest Will, or only true Will, which is that already implied in the acceptance of the Law. Be it also well understood that it is not necessary or right to shut off natural activity of any kind, as certain false folk, eunuchs of the spirit, most foully teach, to the destruction of many. For in every thing soever inhereth its own perfection proper to it, and to neglect the full operation and function of any one part bringeth distortion and degeneration to the whole. Act therefore in all ways, but transforming the effect of all these ways to the One Way of the Will. And this is possible, because all ways are in actual Truth One Way, the Universe being itself One and One Only, and its appearance as Multiplicity that cardinal illusion which it is the very object of Love to dissipate."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 113 In the achievement of Love are two principles, that of mastering, and that of yielding. But the nature of these is hard to explain, for they are subtle, and are best taught by Love Himself in the course of the Operations. But it is to be said generally that the choice of one formula or the other is automatic, being the work of that inmost Will which is alive within you. Seek not then to determine consciously this decision, for herein true instinct is not liable to err. But now I end, without further words: for in our Holy Books are written many details of the actual practices of Love. And those are the best and truest which are most subtly written in symbol and image, especially in Tragedy and Comedy, for the whole nature of these things is in this kind, Life itself being but the fruit of the flower of Love. It is then of Life that I must needs now write to you, seein that by every act of Will in Love you are creating it, a quintessence more mysterious and joyous than you deem, for this which men call life is but a shadow of that true Life, your birthright, and the gift of the Law of Thelema. III OF LIFE SYSTOLE AND DIASTOLE: these are the phases of all component things. Of such also is the life of man. Its curve arises from the latency of the fertilized ovum, say you, to a zenith whence it declines to the nullity of death? Rightly considered, this is not wholly truth. The life of man is but one segment of a serpentine curve which reaches out to infinity, and its zeros but mark the changes from the plus to minus, and minus to plus, coefficients of its equation. It is"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 114 for this cause, among many others, that wise men in old time chose the Serpent as the Hieroglpyh of Life. Life then is indestructible as all else is. All destruction and construction are changes in the nature of Love, as I have written to you in the former chapter proximate. Yet even as the blood in one pulse-throb of the wrist is not the same blood as that in the next, so individuality is in part destroyed as each life passeth; nay, even with every thought. What then maketh man, if he dieth and is reborn a changeling with each breath? This: the consciousness of continuity given by memory, the conception of his Self as something whose existence, far from being threatened by these changes, is in verity assured by them. Let then the aspirant to the sacred Wisdom consider his Self no more as one segment of the Serpent, but as the whole. Let him extend his consciousness to regard both birth and death as incidents trivial as systole and diastole of the heart itself, and necessary as they to its function. To fix the mind in this apprehension of Life, two modes are preferred, as preliminary to the greater realizations to be discussed in their proper order, experiences which transcend even those attainments of Liberty and Love of which I have hitherto written, and this of Life which I now inscribe in this my little book which I am making for you so that you may come unto the Great Fulfilment. The first mode is the acquisition of the Magical Memory so-called, and the means is described with accuracy and clearness in certain of our Holy Books. But for nearly all men this is found to be a practice of exceeding difficulty. Let then the aspirant follow the impulse of his own Will in the decision to choose this or no."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 115 The second mode is easy, agreeable, not tedious, and in the end as certain as the other. But as the way of error in the former lieth in Discouragement, so in the latter are you to be ware of False Paths. I may say indeed generally of all Works, that there are two dangers, the obstacle of Failure, and the snare of Success. Now this second mode is to dissociate the beings which make up your life. Firstly, because it is easiest, you should segragate that Form which is called the Body of Light (and also by many other names) and set yourself to travel in this Form, making systematic exploration of those worlds which are to other material things what your own Body of Light is to your own material form. Now it will occur to you in these travels that you come to many Gates which you are not able to pass. This is because your Body of Light is itself as yet not strong enough, or subtle enough, or pure enough: and you must then learn to dissociate the elements of that body by a process similar to the first, your consciousness remaining in the higher and leaving the lower. In this practice do you continue, bending your Will like a great Bow to drive the Arrow of your consciousness through heavens ever higher and holier. But the continuance in this Way is itself of vital value: for it shall be that presently habit herself shall persuade you that the body which is born and dieth within so little a space as one cycle of Neptune in the Zodiac is no essential of your Self, that the Life of which you are become partaker, while itself subject ot the Law of action and reaction, ebb and flow, systole and diastole, is yet insensible to the afflications of that life which you formerly held to be your sole bond with existence."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 116 And here must you resolve your Self to make the mightiest endeavours: for so flowered are the meadows of this Eden, and so sweet the fruit of its orchards, that you will love to linger among them, and to take delight in sloth and dalliance therein. Therefore I write to you with energy that these enjoyments are dependent upon duality, so that their true name is Sorrow of Illusion, like that of the normal life of man, which you have set out to transcend. Be it according to your Will, but learn this, that (as it is written) they only are happy who have desired the unattainable. It is then best, ultimately, if it be your Will to find alway your chiefest pleasure in Love, that is, in Conquest, and in Death, that is, in Surrender, as I have written to you already. Thus then you shall delight in these delights aforesaid, but only as toys, holding your manhood firm and keen to pierce to deeper and holier ecstasies without arrest of Will. Furthermore, I would have you to know that in this practice, pursued with ardour unquenchable, is this especial grace, that you will come as it were by fortune into states which transcend the practice itself, being of the nature of those works of Pure Light of which I will write to you in the chapter following after this. For there be certain Gates which no being who is still conscious of dividuality, that is, of the Self and not-Self as opposites, may pass through: and in the storming of those Gates by fiery assault of lust celestial, your flame will burn vehemently against your gross Self, though it be already divine beyond your present imagining, and devour it in a mystical death, so that in the Passing of the Gate all is dissolved in formless Light of Unity."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 117 Now then, returning from these states of being, and in the return also there is a Mystery of Joy, you will be weaned from the Milk of Darkness of the Moon, and made partaker of the Sacrament of Wine that is the blood of the Sun. Yet at the first there may be shock and conflict, for the old thought persists by force of its habit: it is for you to create by repeated act the true right habit of this consciousness of the Life which abideth in Light. And this is easy, if your will be strong: for the true Life is no much more vivid and quintessential than the false that (as I rudely estimate) one hour of the former makes an impression on the memory equal to one year of the latter. One single experience, in duration it may be but a few seconds of terrestrial time, is sufficient to destroy the belief in the reality of our vain life on earth: but this wears gradually away if the consciousness, through shock or fear, adhere not to it, and the Will strive not continually to repetition of that bliss, more beautiful and terrible than death, which it hath won by virtue of Love. There be moreover many other modes of attaining the apprehension of true Life, and these two following are of much value in breaking up the ice of your mortal error in the vision of your being. And of these the first is the constant contemplation of the Identity of Love and Death, and the understanding of the dissolution of the body as an Act of Love done upon the Body of the Universe, as also it is written at length in our Holy Books. And with this goeth, as it were sister with twin brother, the practice of mortal love as a sacrament symbolical of that great Death: as it is written ìKill thyselfî: and again ìDie daily.î And the second of these lesser modes is the practice of the mental apprehension and analysis of ideas, mainly as I have already taught you, but with especial empahsis in choice of"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 118 things naturally repulsive, in particular death itself, and its phenomena ancillary. Thus the Buddha bade his disciples to meditate upon Ten Impurities, that is, upon ten cases of death or decomposition, so that the Aspirant, identifying himself with his own corpse in all these imagined forms, might lose the natural horror, loathing, fear or disgust which he might have had for them. Know this, that every idea of every sort becomes unreal, phantastic, and most manifest illusion, if it be subjected to persistent investigation, with concentration. And this is particularly easy to attain in the case of all bodily impressions, because all material things, and especially those of which we are first conscious, namely, our own bodies, are the grossest and most unnatural of all falsities. For there is in us all, latent, that Light wherein no error may endure, and It already teaches our instinct to reject first of all those veils which are most closely wrapt about It. Thus also in meditation it is (for many men) most profitable to concentrate the Will to Love upon the sacred centres of nervous force: for they, like all things, are apt images or true reflexions of their semblances in finer spheres: so that, their gross images being dissipated by the dissolving acid of the Meditation, their finer souls appear (so to speak) naked, and display their force and glory in the consciousness of the aspirant. Yea, verily, let your Will to Love burn eagerly toward this creation in yourselves of the true Life that rolls its waves across the shoreless sea of Time! Live not your petty lives in fear of the hours!

To him who lives in Life naught matters: his is eternal motion, energy, delight of never-failing Change: unwearied, you pass on from Êon to Êon, from star to star, the Universe your playground, its infinite variety of sport ever old and ever new. All those ideas which bred sorrow and fear are known in their truth, and thus become the seed of joy: for you are certain beyond all proof that you can never die: that though you change, change is part of your own nature: the Great Enemy is become the Great Ally. And now, rooted in this perfection, your Self become the very Tree of Life, you have a fulcrum for your lever: you are ready to understand that this pulsation of Unity is itself Duality, and therefore, in the highest and most sacred sense, still Sorrow and Illusion; which, having comprehended, aspire yet again, even unto the Fourth of the Gifts of the Law, unto the End of the Path, even unto Light. IV OF LIGHT I PRAY YOU, be patient with me in that which I shall right concerning Light: for here is a difficulty, ever increasing, in the use of words.

So may I that am inflamed with love of this Light, and drunken on the wine Ethereal of this Light, communicate not so much with your reason and intelligence, but with that principle hidden in yourself which is ready to partake with me. Even so may man and woman become mad with love, no word being spoken between them, because of the induction (as it were) of their souls. And your under-standing will depend upon your ripeness for perception of my Truth. Moreover, if so be that Light in you ready to break forth, then Light will interpret to you these dark words in the language of Light, even as a string inanimate, duly adjusted, will vibrate to its particular tone, struck on another chord. Read, therefore, not only with the eye and brain, but with the rhythm of the Life which you have attained by your Will to Love quickened to dancing measure by these words, which are the movements of the wand of my Will to Love, and so to enkindle your Life to Light.

Yet in the attainment of this Life you will already have experienced that the Quintessence thereof is pure Light, an ecstasy formless, and without bound or mark. In this Light naught exists, for It is homogeneous: and therefore have men called it Silence, and Darkness, and Nothing. But in this, as in all other effort to name it, is the root of every falsity and misapprehension, since all words imply some duality. Therefore, though I call it Light, it is not Light, nor absence of Light. Many also have sought to describe it by contradiction, since through transcendent negation of all speech it may by some natures be attained. Also by images and symbols have men striven to express it: but always in vain. Yet those that were ready to apprehend the nature of this Light have understood by sympathy: and so shall it be with you who read this little book, loving it. However, be it known unto you that the best of all instruction on this matter, and the Word best suited to the ∆on of Horus, is written in the The Book of the Law. Yet also the Book Ararita is right worthy in the Work of Light, as Trigrammaton in that of Will, Cordis Cincti Serpente in the Way of Love, and Liberi in that of Life. All these Books also concern all these Four Gifts, for in the end you will see that every one is inseparable from every other. I wish to write to you with regard to the number 93, the number of Qelhma. For it is not only the number of its inter-pretation Agaph, but also that of a Word unknown to you unless you be Neophyte of our Holy Order of the A∴A∴ which word representeth in itself the arising of the Speech from the Silence, and the return thereunto in the End."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 122 Now the number 93 is thrice 31, which is in Hebrew LA, that is to say NOT, and so it denieth extension in the three dimensions of Space.

Ra-Hoor-Khuith! before the Dyad. By addition ariseth Eleven, the number of True Magick: and by multiplication Three Hundred, the Number of the Holy Spirit or Fire, the letter Shin, wherein all things are consumed utterly. With these considerations, and a full understanding of the mysteries of the Number 666 and 418, you will be armed mightily in this Way of far flight. But you should also consider all numbers in their scales. For there is no means of resolution better than this of pure mathematics, since already therein are gross ideas made fine, and all is ordered and ready for the Alchemy of the Great Work. I have already written to you of how, in the Will of Love, Light ariseth as the secret part of Life. And in the first, the little, Loves, the attained Life is still personal: later, it becometh impersonal and universal. Now then is Will arrived, may I say so, at its magnetic pole, whence the lines of force point alike every way and no way: and Love also is no more a work, but a state. These qualities are become part of the Universal Life, which proceedeth infinitely with the enjoyment of the Will, and of Love as inherent therein. These things therefore, in their perfection, have lost their names, and their natures.

This Light or Nothing is then the Resultant or Totality thereof in pure Perfection; and all other states, positive or negative, are imperfect, since they omit their opposites. Yet, I would have you consider that this equality or identity of equation between all things and No thing is most absolute, so that you will remain no more in one than you did in the other. And you will understand this greatest Mystery very easily in the light of those other experiences which you have enjoyed, wherein motion and rest, change and stability, and many other subtle opposites, have been redeemed to identity by the force of your holy meditation.

Therefore the escape from this apparent evil is to seek the Unity, which you shall do as I have already shewn you. But I will make mention of that which is written concerning this in The Book of the Law. The first step being Will, Evil appears as by this definition, ìall that hinders the execution of the Will.î Therefore is it written: ìThe word of Sin is Restriction.î It should also be noted that in The Book of the Thirty ∆thyrs Evil appears as Choronzon whose number is 333, which in Greek importeth Impotence and Idleness: and the nature of Choronzon is Dispersion and Incoherence. Then in the Way of Love Evil appears as ìall that which tends to prevent the Union of any two things. ì Thus The Book of the Law sayeth, under the figure of the Voice of Nuit: ìtake your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will! But always unto me.î For every act of Love must be ìunder will,î that is, in accordance with the True Will, which is not to rest content with things partial and transitory, but to proceed firmly to the End. So also, in The Book of the Thirty ∆thyrs, the Black Brothers are those who shut themselves up, unwilling to destroy themselves by Love. Thirdly, in the Way of Life Evil appears under a subtler form as ìall that which is not impersonal and universal.î Here The Book of the Law, by the Voice of Hadit, informeth us:"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"LIBER CL 125 ìIn the sphere I am everywhere the centreÖî And again: ìI am Life and the giver of Life Ö ëCome unto meí is a foolish word: for it is I that go. Ö For I am perfect, being Not.î For this Life is in every place and time at once, so that in It these limitations no longer exist. And you will have seen this for yourself, that in every act of Love time and space disappear with the creation of the Life by its virtue, as doth also personality itself. For the third time, then, in even subtler sense, ìThe word of Sin is Restrictionî Lastly, in the Way of Light this same versicle is the key to the conception of Evil. But here Restriction is in the failure to solve the Great Equation, and, later, to prefer one expression or phase of the Universe to another. Against this we are warned in The Book of the Law by the Word of Nuit, saying: ìNone Ö and two. For I am divided for loveís sake, for the chance of unionî, and therefore, ìIf this be not aright: if ye confound the space marks, saying, They are many Ö then expect the direful judgements Öî Now therefore by the favour of Thoth am I come to the end of this my book: and do you arm yourselves accordingly with the Four Weapons: the Wand for Liberty, the Cup for Love, the Sword for Life, the Disk for Light: and with these work all wonders by the Art of High Magick under the Law of the New ∆on, whose Word is Qelhma."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" A PSALM The Lord hath brought me into the House of Darkness; by stealth hath the Lord drawn me into Night.

V., having only escaped becoming an April Fool by delaying a day to summon up enough courage to turn out once more into this cold and uninviting World. Having been oiled, smacked and allowed to live, we shall trouble no further about the details of his career until 1906, when, having reached the age of 20 years, he began to turn his attention toward the Mysteries, and to investigate Spiritualism, chiefly with the idea of disproving it. From this year his interest in the Occult seems to date, and it was about this time that he first consciously aspired to find, and get into touch with, a True Occult Order. This aspiration was, as we shall see, fulfilled three years later, when he had an opportunity to become a Probationer of the A∴A∴, and immediately grasped it; but during those three years his researches led him into varied paths: Spiritualism, Faithism and other Isms on the one hand, and ìThe Europe,î ìThe Leicester,î and ìThe Cosy Cornerî on the other: last, but not least, into Marriage, a difficult thing to put on one side and perhaps best left on the other. Having then plunged wholeheartedly into this final experiment,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 130 becoming as it were ìOmnia in Unoî for a time, he emerged in a frame of mind well suited to the study of Scientific Illuminism, of which he was much in need, and, having signed the Probationerís Pledge Form on December 24th, 1909, E.V., he tookóafter careful thoughtóthe Motto ìUnus in Omnibusî and has been riding very comfortably ever since. From this time onward, according to the Rules of the Order, he began keeping a written record of his Work, and this makes our task easier; but since he himself became more serious from that moment, we must to a certain extent follow his example and treat what is recorded as the attempt of a struggling soul to obtain Light for himself and others. Whatever his mistakes, however poor his results, or laughable his failures, there is this much to be said for him, that he never turned back. Section II December 24, 1909, to May 14, 1910 Frater V.I.O. started off bravely enough. As soon as he had read the first number of The Equinox, and before he got into touch with any Member of the A∴A∴ he made an attempt at Asana. The earliest record I can find reads as follows: Thursday, Nov. 4th, 1909. 11:20 P.M. to 11:41 P.M. Asana. Position I. The God. Inclination for back to bend, just above hips, had to straighten up several times. Opened eyes once and moved head, after about five minutes.

He hoped to do 60 minutes next time. But he does not appear to have done so, for after signing his Probationerís Oath on December 24th I find no record till January 11th, 1910, E.V., the day he received his first written instructions from his Neophyte, Frater P.A. As those instructions represent the basis upon which he worked for a considerable period, I shall include them here, in spite of the fact that it may have been out of order for him to work on definite instructions at all, since the Probationer is supposed to choose for himself those practices which please him best, and to experiment therewith for himself. Since however he did not know this at the time, he cannot be blamed for doing his best along the lines laid down by his Neophyte.1 In any case he might have done far worse than to strive to carry out these few simple rules which are as follows: THE RULES 1. Ever be moderate and follow the middle path; rather be the tortoise than the hare; do not rush wildly into anything; but do not abandon what you have taken up, without much forethought. 2. Always keep your body and mind in a healthy and fit condition; and never carry out an exercise, whether mental or physical, when you are fatigued. 3. In an ideal country the hours in which to practice are: at sunrise, sunset, noon and midnight (and always before a meal never immediately after one).    1 It is presumptuous for a Neophyte to lay down rules; for (a) he cannot possibly know what his Probationer needs, having no record to guide him; (b) the Probationerís task is to explore his own nature, not to follow any prescribed course. A third objection is that by putting the Probationer in Corsets, an entirely flabby person may sneak through his year, and become a Neophyte, to the shame of the Order. But this objection is theoretical; for Initiation is overseen from the Third Order, where no Error may endure. ó O.M."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 132 As this cannot be done with comfort, in this country (England), let your chief practice take place an hour or half an hour before your breakfast hour. 4. If possible set apart a room wherein to carry out your exercises; keep it clean, and only keep in it objects which please you; burn a little incense in the room before beginning an exercise; keep the room holy to yourself, and do not allow yourself or another to do anything unbalanced in thought or action in it. In will and deed make this room a temple and a symbol of that greater Temple which is your HIGHER SELF. THE EXERCISES The First Exercise Rise to time, and without undue haste, wash and dress, robe yourself and enter the room you have set apart; burn a little incense and turning to the East repeat some simple orison such as: ìMay the light of Adonai arise within me, may it guide me through this day and be as a lamp to lighten my darkness.î Then make a general confession, as shortly as possible, of your last dayís work and enter it in your diary, after which sit down in a comfortable position and do the following. With your hands upon your knees and your head straight, take in a breath in measured time inwards and concentrate the whole of your thought on that breath as it flows into your lungs, cutting away all other thoughts that may arise at the time; then exhale the breath, still keeping your thought fixed on it. Do this for some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and mark down in your diary the number of ìbreaks,î or any result. The whole of this practice must be performed rhythmically and harmoniously. The Second Exercise As the rush of daily work tends to undo what the morning exercise has done, try your utmost to turn every item of your professional work into a magical exercise. Do all, even the smallest work, in honour and glory of Adonai: excel in your special duties in life, because He is of you, and you of Him; do not think of Him as Adonai, but think of Adonai as the work; and of your daily work create a symbol of the Symbol of ìThe Great Work which is TO BE.î The Third Exercise. As the rush of your daily work tends to unbalance you, so do the pleasures you indulge in. Cultivate joyfulness in all your amusements; and, when joyful, break out into silent and inward praise of the joy within you. Do not make a prudish exercise of it, work silently and joyously, and do not discuss your results with casual friends. And above all do everything for the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 133 honour and glory of Adonai, so that of your daily pleasures you may construct a symbol of that Unchanging Joy that IS. These instructions were accompanied by a letter from which I quote the following: ìThe enclosed exercises per-form regularly, say to yourself: ëI will do these for three months; even if I get no benefit from them, yet I am deter-mined to do them.í Write to me whenever you like, but donít consider any result that you may get as worth much; for these little exercises are only to produce an equilibrium which is essential before really setting out. If you add any exercise of your own then do it at a definite hour daily and do it continuously; to take up an exercise and then drop it is worse than useless, for it is unbalancing.î Now, as any Probationer knows, as soon as one sets out to do the simplest task regularly and with magical intent, that task becomes not only difficult, but well nigh impossible of performance. This is just what V.I.O. found, and no sooner had his task been set than all kinds of difficulties presented themselves, like the dog-faced demons mentioned by Zoroaster, to prevent its fulfilment. He tried, but at the end of January he writes: ìI cannot get on under these con-ditions. Had plenty of time to do exercises this morning, but was continually interrupted. Did not robe myself as I have no place fit to call a temple.î How little did he know at that time how well off he really was in the latter respect! He was living in comfort in a Kensington Flat with every con-venience of civilization; a few years later he was glad to do Asana and perform his meditations out in the rain, clad in pyjamas, because his tiny tent in British Columbia was too small to allow of work inside. But we digress. At this point his record breaks off abruptly. He remained in London until May of 1910, when circumstances arose which made it possible for him to visit British Columbia.

Section III July 25, 1910, to April 30, 1911 The next entry in his diary is dated July 25th, 1910. It is a general confession of the previous six months. Half of his year of Probation had passed away, and he has not reported to, or received any communication from, the Order. He laments his negligence in this respect, but writes: ìYet know I well that I alone have suffered and shall suffer from this negligence, and I must humbly take any results that may arise out of my failure. Still, even though I may have neglected the advice given me when I first became a Probationer, I feel that I have progressed, be it never so slightly, along the Path which from the first I set out to tread. May it not be, O Adonai, that even now the second six months may be made to balance the first six, and that what is passed may yet be for the best?î At that time he had not found out that things always turn out for the best; it took him a long while to realize this, but it is evident that soon afterwards his efforts produced some result; for we find an entry on Sunday, August 7th, 1910. ìI have found (for a few moments) the Peace which passeth all understanding. Amen.î This was evidently the foreshadow-ing of his first really notable result, the first Dawning of L.V.X. which he experienced on August 29th. There is an entry on September 2nd, full of joy and gladness and wonder at his first Illumination; and then, three days later, he had evidently recognised that this alone was not enough, and this was evidently the reason for the next somewhat curious entry"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 135 of September 5th, 7:53 P.M., which I shall quote practically in full: I am calm now, as I commence to write what may be the last entry in this diary. All that I can remember of my life on this planet has, as I look back upon it, been guided by an unseen hand. For so short a life (24 years and six months) it has been filled with an unusual number of incidents, some painful, some joyful and some of a purely spiritual nature. I regret nothing. Again three days have passed since I made entry in this book. I cannot talk of what has happened during those three days, it seems useless to try and do so, in fact it seems useless to make this entry at all except that I know not what is before me, and I feel that had I (or if I) lived longer upon this planet it would have been my life work, indeed it must have been, to help others to the Path. Therefore to those who follow after are these lines written in the hope that they may be saved one drop of the anguish I now suffer. Whatever may have happened in this last three days, the results of my thoughts amount to this. I who have found the heart of the shining triangle, who have indeed become one with the Great White Brotherhood, who have heard the Voice of God in all Its sweetness, who have made that message a part (nay all) of my being, who have held my Beloved in my arms, who have Become my Beloved and lost myself therein, who have for ever given up my lower self, who have conquered Death, who have felt the Pain of the whole World, who have found Wisdom, Love and Power, who have given up All to become Nothing, I who have seen the need of the World, have found that books (hitherto my dearest companions) have no longer any word to say to meóhave found that knowledge (relative) or what I thought was knowledge, is of no avail to supply the need of all that other part of my Being that my great God-love would give it. I who have conquered Fear and Death, am now confronted with the fact that without Absolute Knowledge all is vain. I am going to ask the One Last Question. WHY? I have written it. An awful stillness falls. I am alone in my lodgings, I have no money, and I cannot use my Will to demand it from others if I can give nothing in return to help them to find what they really seek. I have cried with Christ ìEli, Eli, Lama Sabacthani.î I have suffered the Bloody Sweat with Him on the Cross, and now I say with Him ìIt is finishedî Amen. One last note occurs to me before I wrap up this book and seal it and address it to F. . . in whose hands it will be safe. I looked into the eyes of a little child this evening. Does the answer lie there? Sep. 5th, 12:26 P.M. It is over. I have unsealed the package and once more opened the book. This time it will be but a short entry. Very quietly I knelt; I did not robe or burn incense. I just took with me the memory of the little child who had looked into my eyes as I kissed its forehead. Very"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 136 quietly I asked my question. I rose and lay upon the bed, and soon the answer came. It came quite silently, and at first I thought I must be mistaken, I had (it seemed) heard it so many times before. No other answer came, so I went out into the streets and along my way. Gradually the fuller meaning has dawned on me, and I have returned to make this entry. I need not add much more. I do not put the answer down. It was given in silence and must remain in Silence. Still there seemed to be just one little ripple of joy in the Great Silent Sea as another sould gently sank to its rest, and the silent voices whispered ìWelcome brother.î Then all was calm and Peace as before. The little ripple flowed on to let the whole world know, then, having delivered its message, all was still. Amen. Whatever the nature of this Illumination, probably a state of Dhyana, it left a very marked result on the consciousness of Frater V.I.O., and gave him the necessary energy to continue his Work through many a dark and dismal period. He himself could not gauge its value at all at the time. He was alone in Vancouver and out of touch with the Order, having received no further word from his Neophyte since he left England. In fact he heard nothing till January of the following year. He however sent a post-card to say that he had obtained some result. About this same time I find an entry called ìThe Philosophy of V.I.O.î which seems of interest on account of some similarities to the Law of Thelema, of which he had heard nothing at that time. It reads as follows: Man is bound by but One Law. If he breaks a part of it, he hurts no one but himself. While he lives in unity with It, he is God.. While he does not live in unity with It he is Man. While he lives in unity with it he becomes the Law. To realise the Law and live it is the Great Work. To break the Law after he has realized it is Sin. To endeavour to bring all to the knowledge of the Law, is to keep the Law. Seek ye the Law that ye may be Free. Wisdom, Love and Power, these three are One. That these should be One is the Law."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 137 By finding the Point from which these three become equal, and there remaining, by this means only, can the Law be Known.

By the end of September the immediate results of this first Illumination seem to have worn off, and we find Frater V.I.O. striving desperately to estimate the value of what had happened to him. He was certainly in a mental muddle, as the following entry shows, yet at the same time his one thought seems to have been to find a means of helping others to find that Light which had so transformed his whole being. Sept. 24th, 1910. Driad Hotel. Victoria, B. C. I sit here with the idea of attempting to classify the results lately obtained. (Since L.V.X. entry.) I may mention that during the interval I have carefully read and studied Crowleyís Tannh‰user, The Sword of Song, Excluded Middle, Time, Berashith, Science and Buddhism, Three Characteristics, etc. In the Light of Understanding, all these works have taken on a very different aspect to when I read them previously. Also the Purpose of Liber LXV is clear. The result of all this gives me a feeling that I have arrived at the End and also at the Beginning at the same time. This (by the way) seems the usual experience of the beginner; no sooner does he get a result, any result, than he immediately thinks he is at the end. But V.I.O. is evidently not to be deceived in that way, for he goes on: Now, had I really arrived at the End, it seems reasonable to suppose I should not be here writing this. My body and mind are at any rate still in existence as a body and mind. But, as these are admittedly impermanent, does it matter much that they continue to exist in this form or no? What has that to do with the Consciousness of the Existence of That which transcends both?

This realization having come about has at any rate remained as a glimpse of Being, different from the previous not-being. The result of his mental analysis appears to amount to this, that he had experienced within himself a state of consciousness full of Peace and Joy, yet which more nearly approximated to Zero than any other term. He can find nothing with which to compare this state, but he recognizes its immense superiority over normal consciousness, and feels an intense desire to make it possible for others to share his experience. Since however he finds it impossible to explain it in words, he recognises that he must obtain the knowledge of some definite System of producing the state scientifically, but since be is not even a Neophyte of the A∴A∴, he wonders if They will recognise him as qualified to demand the right to know and spread Their teachings. He determines in any case to reduce the wants of the Ego as a separate being as far as possible, by forgetting self in his efforts to do all he can for others according to the Light he had obtained. He found however that the destruction of the Ego was not thus easily accomplished at the first assault. Never-theless he learned, not from books but from experience, that the Goal was to be found within himself, and that the nearer he could approach to the Consciousness of Nothingness the nearer he got to the Realization of Pure Existence. This reduction of consciousness to Zero then became the fixed aim of his Meditations; and any other experiments he entered upon, were, from that time onward, looked upon as necessary in order that he might fit himself to help others, rather than for his personal development.

These practices may then be said to have a cumulative effect, which makes them all the more valuable in helping towards the general control of body and mind. But what is of still greater importance as far as Frater V.I.O. was concerned, they evidently had the effectó heightened perhaps by a letter from his Neophyteóof causing him to make a fresh and more determined effort to perform the Mystical Exercises for a definite period and with regularity, according to his original A∴A∴ instructions. From January 30th, 1911, to April 30th of that year, he kept a scientifically tabulated diary and during the prescribed three months he never missed a day in the performance of his appointed task. His results, during this period, were perhaps not of a very startling nature, but, as any true Student learns, it is the long and continued ìgrind,î the determined effort to carry out the work in hand or task set, in spite of every obstacle that may arise, that really counts when it comes to lasting results.

From this letter he learned that many changes had transpired since he left England, and among them that Frater P.A. had severed his connection with the Outer Order, but was willing to continue in charge of him. Feb. 5th. He wondered if Frater P.A. had only told him this as a test. It must be remembered that all this while he had worked on alone, and had had no news to speak of, and this he attributed to his own failure to carry out his task in detail. In this he was no doubt right to a great extent, for unless any Probationer does what he is instructed, he can expect no further help, which would only mean that the Master concurred in his laziness or weakness. March 6th, 1911. Up to this time, although he had done the exercises regularly no particular result had occurred, and we find this note: ìI do not really look for any results now, or expect any, since control of ëselfí is the object of these exercises.î Now it is to be noted that when one really gets to a state when having worked one is content to continue to do so, expecting no results, one often obtains them.

My Will runs over the strings, causing complete and harmonious vibrations in my being, which seems to give forth at times an unforrnulated and therefore most delightful melody. March 28th. How can I write it, how put into words the least idea of that which is unformed? Yet I will try while yet a vestige of the thought remains. I have conceived within my womb a child. Or is it that I have for the first time realized that I have a womb? Yet it is so, that ìblankî within, into which I have projected my thoughts, and from which they have come forth again ìlivingî is for a greater purpose.

And by complete union therwith . . . I cannot formulate any more now. This entry indicates a recognition of the ìformulation of the negative in the egoî which shall eventually destroy it.

During the last three days have gradually been nearing another ìclimaxî which reached, shall I say, its height on Saturday, when I arrived at a state of Illumination which was, as it were ìadded to my previous state.î I seized a scrap of paper and wrote ìAmid all the complications and perplexity there remains, back of all, the Will. The Will to Be. The Will to Be Nothing, which is the only state inconceivable to the mind. The old God willed to be something, and the Universe appeared; The New God wills to be Nothing and becomes?î After writing the foregoing, there was a state of bliss the reflection of which was caught by the body. So joyful it became that it whirled round in a mad dance, and was filled with music. It was stifled by the confines of the room; but ìIî was Free, so it couldnít matter much. (This is the second experience of rhythm filling the body, and causing it to whirl and dance in order to find expression somehow.) April 9th. Started to read about 8:30 this morning. Sometime during morning lost idea of ìegoî to realize All as Self. (Left notes for a couple of hours.) I find terrible difficulty in expressing the slightest idea of that which occurred during this state, yet it would seem of importance to do the best I can. That there is no soul struck me as a horrible blank. That I do not, and never have existed as ìIî comes as a wonderful realization while the consciousness of the unreality of the ìIî lasts. With the loss of ìthe egoî comes the consciousness that the whole universe of things and people is but a part of the State then arrived at. That if this little body dies, existence still remains in all the other part of the Universe and therefore the change called Death, occurring in different atoms, all the time, makes no difference. Is there any reason why one should not look upon every thing and everybody as parts of Oneself, since one is equally willing to allow any other body to consider you as a part of their imagination only? It would seem that one tiny partóselfóhas been fondly cherished, while in reality that tiny part is but a reflex of the Whole which is really You, but even this state must in the end give way before the Power of Nothing. April 16th, 8:30 A.M. Finished reading The Life of Buddha, and then, lying down, composed myself for Meditation. Breathed regularly and deeply for a time, afterwards stopping all entries two or three times. (Shanmukhi Mudra.) Presently I passed into a state which was practically desireless. I could feel the Goal, but the wish to help others made it impossible to Become the State I contemplated. After this, I was surprised, on letting all breath out of the body, to feel a sudden lightness, as if I were about to float. This being unexpected, caused me to turn my thoughts to the body, after which, although I tried, I could not get back to the previous"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 147 state. I estimate that I remained in the condition mentioned for over an hour, as it was 12 oíc. when I looked at the time. In fact, it may have been nearer two hours. The above meditation left Frater V.I.O. with a feeling of ìNearly but not Quite.î He had, to some extent, gazed at the Goal of Nothingness, but had failed to Become that Goal. The following day there is despondency and dissatisfaction. On April 22nd reason again holds sway, and he tries to use it to discover just where he is, of course without success, since Reason can never explain that which is Beyond Reason. I think at this point he also began to make another grave error; he tried to compare his experiences with those of John St. John, with the result that, later on, when he undertook a Retirement, that of J. St. J. subconsciously influenced him to a great extent, although he would not and could not have admitted it at the time. In these things one must be Oneself, not try to be another. His entry of April 22 is a long one, and I quote it in part. I wish I could express myself better. On reading J. St. J. again I find that I can comprehend it ever so much better than when I first read it some three months after its publication. Then, it seemed like a dream of the far distant future; now, many parts seem like records of my own experiences, only expressed infinitely better than I have been able to put them. Now, of what value are the experiences I have gained? Why is the state of Oneness with Adonai not lasting, or rather, is it possible to remain always conscious of that State? How is it when reading an account like J. St. Johnís that I know what he is talking about, and can feel with him the difficulty of putting these things into words? I could not have realized this a year ago, before I entered into certain states of which I cannot gauge the value at all, while in normal consciousness. There is no Doubt Then. But how may I be Sure always? I will fetch The Equinox, and put down the points as they come to me. Let me quote page 87. ìWell, one thing I got (again!) that is that when all is said and done I am that I am, all these thoughts of mine, angels and devils both, are only fleeting moods of me. The one true self of me is Adonai. Simple!

What results I have obtained have been in the nature of becoming the thing itself, not seeing it. However, to pass on: Is the idea of coming back to help others (see Sun. Apr. 16) only a form of the Dweller on the Threshold and caused through fear of annihilation or madness? Or is it a concession to my own weakness, a pandering to my ìselfî because I am really nowhere near ready to hurl myself into the Gulf, instead of which I come back to normal consciousness, and try and make myself believe I have ìgiven upî what I ìcould not getî for the sake of ìothersî which do not exist at the time (for me)? This is certainly a difficult one to tackle; I am entering it so as to try and formulate the proposition clearly. Now, the doubt enters my mind, that I have only put it down in order to appear honest to Fra. P.A., or anyone who may read this record. NO. . . . The foregoing thought seems to have a parallel in J. St. J. Again on page 96 ìI must attain or . . . an end to J. St. J.î seems similar to the state arrived at one Sept. 5, 1910, when I determined to ask the last WHY? and afterwards entered into Peace. On page 133 he says ìsubtly, simply, imperceptibly gliding I passed away into nothing. . . . I felt the interior trembling kindle itself into a kiss. . . . also I was given to enjoy the subtle Presence of my Lord interiorly during the whole of the twelfth day. But he withdrew Himself . . . yet leaving a comfort not to be told, a Peace . . . The Peace.î Yes, with me also the Peace has remained, but sometimes I cannot connect myself with It, or fail to do so, being led away by Maya. Then comes the entry of the Thirteenth Day: ìBeing entered into the Silence let me abide in the Silence. Amen.î And here I am puzzled. Either J. St. J. attained permanently to a State such that he was never again annoyed by the silly mistake of identifying Himself with the body, or he did not.3 But after all, what has that to do with V.I.O.? It has certainly nothing to do with J.S.J. But how do I stand? This seems to be the position. While in normal conscious-ness I know that I (or Not I) am ever in the state of which I sometimes catch the reflection when I realize that I am not I. There, that is the clearest original thought I have expressed this afternoon, and bad at that. Of course, I am really quite content, it is only when I begin to think and reason about things that I begin to become discontented. Itís about time I shut up.

On Sunday, May 7th he writes: I have not made an entry in this record for a whole week. I seem to be losing control, and my diary, lying untouched in my drawer, is becoming like a horrible fiend. It worries me when I do not enter it; and yet it requires a great effort even to touch it or take it out, while to enter it daily appears an almost superhuman task. Why is this? I have done exercises this week as usual, but a little earlier than previously, because I have to be at the office by 8:30 A.M. instead of nine oíc. as heretofore. I think Fra. P.A. might write to me. I feel that he is testing me, and have tried to hold to that idea. I know that really it does not matter, but I am weak yet, and should so like a little friendly push and a few words of advice. I feel like dropping it all for a time; but that is perhaps the very thing that is so difficult, in fact, the whole trick!

Then, when hope was about dead, I obtained a trace of it. It came as a drink of sweet nectar to a thirsty pilgrim, and it is wonderful how much better I feel. The note re Neophytes and Probationers has set me at rest about the silence of Fra P.A.; and confirms, what all the while I have suspected, that his delay in answering is a test. This confirmation is cheering, however hard the trial may have been, in so far as I had made up my mind to work on, whether he writes or not, and had got quite used to the idea of having to work out my own Path, without outside aid or encouragement. He was also pleased to find some of his own experiments more or less confirmed in ìLiber HHHî of which he writes: M.M.M. 2, ìmentions the breath playing upon the skin, etc.î I have experienced this, and asked Fra P.A. for instructions thereon. Sometimes, after hard breathing, I have been filled with the sensation. I think I understand the ìlightning flash,î but shall experiment. My present knowledge is more as a sheet of summer lightning.

When I came to thoughts on waking of Saturday morning and got to the ìblankî I experienced some mental visions and ìtelephone-cross voices,î but cannot say if they were connected with any dream; then suddenly I found myself lying in bed with the last thoughts of the previous night in mind. Yesterday, I read the article on the subject (Training of the Mind) carefully, also learnt the formula of the four great meditations on Love, Pity, Happiness and Indifference.

However, once started, I got back through Sunday and very nearly, if not quite as fully, over the two previous days; then, having got into the swing, I roughly attempted a short and incomplete review of my whole life, which although brief, was much fuller than I expected. I remembered things connected with early childhood quite accurately, but of course not with full connections. Then something occurred that I really did not expect, and only later trials will prove if it was an illusion or not. Having tried hard to pierce the blank, back of all, I had a sudden clear sensation of lying on a bed with people around, and in particular an elderly man in black velvet and knee breeches, whom I at once felt was my Tutor, leaning over me. The ideas that came with this were that I was quite young, and had some disease like consumption, that the family was wealthy, and the house a Country Residence. These impressions were very real and quite unexpected, but as I used to have a dread of consumption, and still young, and meditation took place lying down, it would seem that very little imagination would make up the rest. However, I mention it, as the experience was different from anything I can previously remember. July 8th, 1911. About a fortnight ago, I received a letter from Frater P.A.5 in answer to my previous two. I was pleased to hear from him, but he gave me a good talking to, also some new instructions. He wanted to    5 Frater P.A. was not a Neophyte, but had been appointed to receive other Probationers for administrative convenience. This was a plain breach of the regulations of the Order, and the result was this comic letter. Frater P.A. was apparently under the impression that as soon as any one happened along into Samadhi, he was to yawn his ìNunc dimittis.î This incident should be a warning to all those in charge of authority that they must in no wise vary the strict instructions of the Order, however obvious may appear the advantages of doing so. The result of Frater P.A.ís presumption in trying to train Frater V.I.O., instead of pressing on to the mark of his own high calling, was that he simply dropped out of the Order altogether, leaving himself as a memorial only this ridiculous episode, in which he appears as a small boy who should have hooked a tarpon when he was fishing for catfish. Had he adhered to the rules of the Order, attended solely to his own business, and forwarded V.I.O.ís record to his superiors, who were competent to interpret it, we should not have had this excellent example of the results of presumption and folly to guide us for the future, and to enliven our perusal of the record of our conscientious V.I.O. with a touch of timely merriment. ó O.M."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 152 know, what I meant by making a claim to having attained Samadhi, or something very like it, in August last, and then shortly afterwards started cutting my arm, etc. I have not answered it yet, but this much for reference: (1) I never mentioned Samadhi, nor can I remember claiming to have attained it. (2) I did attain a state of consciousness which has had a lasting effect upon my life and made my viewpoint entirely different from that time. (3) The language I used to describe the state, came perfectly naturally to me, as the most convenient to describe a state foreign to any previous experience.

I did so and am not sorry. This letter from Fra P.A. giving new practice, etc., combined with some considerable dissatisfaction on Frater V.I.O.ís part, regarding his present state, caused him to undertake another regular spell of work for 32 days, after which he seems to have recorded very little until March 25 in the following year, viz., 1912. He then experimented with SSS section of ìLiber HHHî, from The Equinox, vol. V and obtained automatic rigidity. He writes: ì(1) Brain became charged with electric fluid or Prana, in fact whole face and hands became as if connected with an electric battery, also brain seemed luminous but void. (2) Could not awaken spine from ëyonií; but, after persisting, the part just below small of back became enlivened, then under ribs, then breast and nape of neck.

He then reported this, and his general progress, to Fra P.A. In July, he received a letter from Fra P.A., saying that he had now arrived at a stage when he might undertake an Operation for the Invocation of Adonai,6 which would require six weeksí work, the last twelve days of which must be in complete Retirement. At first he could see no possible way to undertake this, owing to, (1) Family Affairs, (2) Office work, (3) Lack of money. He determined however to go ahead in spite of apparent obstacles, and duly made a start at Midnight, August 31. From that time until September 18th he was occupied by the Preparatory work, and from Midnight September 18th to Midnight September 30th by the Purity Section. October 1st to October 12th Proper Retirement, and on October 12th Invocation of Holy Guardian Angel. All this meant a great deal of work and trouble, and much new experience gained, but was on the whole a failure, though a Step on the Path. During this retirement he cut a Wand, as a Symbol not of his will but of the Will of Adonai in him. It would be hardly right to say that this Magical Retirement produced no results, though it may not have produced the One Desired Result. By the time a man has made 671 entries in his Magical Record (as Frater V.I.O. did during those six weeks) and each of those entries has a direct bearing on the matter in hand, he is bound to have produced a state of mind somewhat different from normal consciousness. (It is interesting to note that 671, by a curious coincidence, is the numeration of Adonai, spelt in full, the Central idea of the Invocation.)    6 No man has the right to make the slightest suggestion to another as to when he should or should not undertake this critical and central Operation.

October 9, 9:6 P.M. (This was the 9th day of Section C, and the 39th day of the complete Operation.) The ìstateî is getting more and more difficult to describe, in fact I donít know what to make of it. I might almost say I feel ìnormalî; and yet there is a subtle difference. There is (I think) an entire absence of fear, worry, disgust, joy, sorrow, pain, or any of the old states, and this seems to be a condition of calm observation without any desire to criticise anything. I suppose, as a matter of fact, it is a state of equilibrium. I think I have it. It is the empty shrine awaiting the in-dwelling of the God. 10 P.M. I experienced another peculiar state just now. Having closed my eyes for a few moments (concentrating), I thought I would try and think backwards over the last few things I had been doing, but found, try as I would, I could not think of things done even a moment before. All was the ìpresent peculiar experience,î and there was no getting away from it. The concentration acted just like a magnet, and became automatic. Again, on trying to look back over this retirement, it appears as a ìSingle state of consciousness,î not as a number of events. I should really have to read my diary if I wanted to know any details in succession just now. At the end of the 10th day of this Section C and the beginning of the 11th day I think the true climax of the Operation took place, for he writes: Oct. 11, 12:30. So did the day start and I knelt at the altar from 12 Midnight until 12:28. During this time did my Lord Adonai begin to manifest within me, so that my being was wrapped away in bliss ineffable. And my body was filled with rapture of His coming until the cry burst from my lips ìMy Lord and my God.î There are no words to describe Thee, my Beloved, though I yet tremble with the joy of Thy presence, yet do I feel that this is but the beginning of the reflection of Thee. O God, wrap me utterly away, beyond even this Bliss. Let me be utterly consumed in Thine Essence. Amen.

All being in order I knelt in prayer and at 7 P.M. I arose and performed the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, then, taking the ritual in my left hand and raising the wand in my right, I slowly and clearly read the Oath and the Invocation.

Then something seemed to tell me to get up and to kneel again at the altar, yet I waited, but presently I arose and stood at the altar, and I felt ìI am that I amî; but there seemed not much joy in the thought, and yet, I knew that I had done all, even the least thing, to the best of mine understanding and ability. . . .

Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died: and I did in the morning as I was commanded. And the people said unto me: Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? Then I answered them. The word of the Lord came unto me saying: Speak unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God . . .

Answered same on Jan. 26th, and was surprised and pleased on Feb. 26th, to receive a reply passing me to the Grade of Neophyte, followed by the necessary documents. Answered this on Feb. 28th. This letter from the Chancellor of A∴A∴ passing Frater V.I.O. to the grade of Neophyte, contained the following passage, which is important, in the light of later events: ìWe wish our Body to be a Body of Servants of Humanity. A time will come when you will obtain the experience of the 14th ∆thyr. You will become a Master of the Temple. That experience must be followed by that of the 13th ∆thyr, in which, the Master, wholly casting aside all ideas of personal attainment, busies himself exclusively with the care of others.î The year 1913 was an important one for Frater V.I.O. in many ways. For one thing, it was during this period that he was forced to stand alone, and to rely upon himself and his own judgment of what was the right course of action for the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXV 157 governance of his life and the solution of his family difficulties as well as his occult problems. Hitherto, as before remarked, he had been under the guidance of one upon whom he had looked as his Neophyte, and in whom he had placed the utmost confidence. He now found himself in one of the most trying situations that had up to that time been his lot to cope with, viz.: that he must choose between the continuance of that guidance, and the regular course of training mapped out in the Outer Order of the A∴A∴. He must either resign the grade of Neophyte just conferred upon him, severing his connection with the Outer Order, or cease to work under Frater P.A. altogether. The reasons for this cannot be dealt with fully in this place, nor would they be of the slightest interest to our readers. Suffice it to say that Frater V.I.O. had pledged himself to work on certain lines for six months and that these lines had been laid down by Frater P.A. His duty was then fairly clear, so he practically severed himself from obtaining guidance from either his old Neophyte or his newly appointed Zelator, until that period of work, to which he felt bound by his own oath to himself, was over, and at the end of that time, having worked hard and well. Those who were guiding and directing his life made the way clear for him, and he found himself in a position to accept the instruction of the A∴A∴, coming under the direct guidance of Frater O.M. This event must not be supposed to reflect in any way on Frater P.A. for whom he always felt and will feel great love and respect; the circumstances leading up to this change were outside the sphere of influence of Fra V.I.O. and the more difficult to judge owing to his isolation in Canada. With this brief allusion to the change in his occult affairs, we may pass on to a corresponding change in his material surroundings, for"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 158 although he continued with his usual office work, he lived during the best part of this year under canvas in a small tent by the sea shore, necessitating some miles of walking every day, and throwing him a good deal more in touch with Nature than formerly; also the addition of a ìlittle strangerî to his family had a marked effect on his home affairs, being as it were the key to the solution of certain problems that had been puzzling him in that direction. During the period from March 2nd to September 4th, when we might say he was working on alone, his record shows some 340 Meditation practices, mostly in the Asana known as the Dragon, the periods ranging from a few minutes to something over an hour, but most of them comparatively short, the average perhaps being twenty minutes. After this there is a gap, during which he worked morning and evening most days, but made no further record till November 9, from which date to December 31 over eighty practices are recorded. Of the details of all this early work it is not necessary to treat very fully, but since, on sending in his record at the end of the year, it was returned by Frater O.M. with various notes and comments of the greatest help and value to Fra V.I.O., I am selecting those passages so commented upon as likely to be of most interest and help to other students.

How one longs sometimes to express things and thoughts and generally ends by some commonplace entry. I think to-night I will try a little more than usual. All this time I have been plodding on, having made up my mind to a course of action in accordance with my aspiration. Day after day I have continued until this round of existence has become almost a fixed habit. My times of meditation and practice have dwindled till they are somewhat short, but for all that, the main idea has never become clouded. I feel far more determined in every way than I did, although less certain of any fixed goal. I know also that I have problems to face, now, or in the future, but have learnt to keep doing what comes to hand, without wavering or despairing. I do not seem to have made much definite progress, yet there are signs which give me to understand that all is as it should be; perhaps I am more in tune and so do not notice such vivid changes. I have found nature very fair and beautiful, this summer. I have got to love Her so much more than formerly. Then again, I have mastered Her a little more; I have learnt more of swimming, climbing, walking and other exercises through daily practice. I have made new friends, have learnt from them and taught them in return. All this, in spite of the limited existence of living in a tiny tent and often being very hard up. The power to retreat into that part of me which is Peace, free from all strife, remains with me.

S. and L. have become sufficiently interested to apply for Studentship, and W. has at last written and asked re Probationer-ship. Have heard finally from Fra P.A. and answered his letter. Nov. 26, 11:40 to 11:55 P.M. Meditation on Love. Commenced with sending Love to the six directions of space (See Training of the Mind, The Equinox, vol. 5). Became identified with Love to the exclusion of all other ideas. It is verily a dew which dissolves thought. [Dangerous, though, for a beginner.

Looking up, could not see this star from where I was standing on the step at front of Temple. Someone said: ìEnter the water.î Did so, finding it reached to the neck. Looked up, and could discern the star clearly. Someone said ìYou must travel up through the roof to the star.î Did so, and discovered I was without clothes. Some time elapsed before I could get near the star, but on doing so I was whirled round it three times and alighted. Then became conscious that the body had given place to a flame only. Ascended as a flame into the air. Became dimly conscious that the flame was in the heart of a larger body. Strove still to rise, but came to blackness. Returned and disrobed.

Rose to a great height. Suddenly, as it were, a rope flashed round me and fell, forming a spiral, ever widening, at the top of which I sat. Stood up on this, only to fall, down, down, down, not quite vertically into the water. Rising again, and striking out, I after a short while perceived a boat, something like a gondola, and swam towards it. It was rowed by a dark-skinned man, old and wrinkled, whom I at first thought to be an Indian. As I reached the boat and put my hand on the side, it seemed as if he would strike at me with his oar, but no, he grinned, and I drew myself into the boat and sat in the fore part, which was high and covered by a sort of hood. Presently, it struck me that the man was not living but dead. Death. We then drifted in a mist, and all became blank for a while; the memory of boat, man and self, were all but lost. When the mist cleared I realized that the man was no longer there, and I myself guided the boat. Coming back out of the mist the waters were blue and no longer black, and I realized that day was breaking. Gradually I watched the Sunrise, and set the boat in that direction, rowing so as to keep my face to the Sun. It seemed like a Portal; but, keeping on, it presently rose, and by the time it was getting high in the heavens I perceived a fair City ahead.

Entering this he led me to the altar, which was supported by brackets from the wall, and above which was a beautiful stained window. At the sides were thin columns and sort of boxes, similar to theatre boxes. We knelt at the altar; and he took my hand and said: ìRaise your consciousness.î I perceived a star and crescent above me, and a cross dimly formulated in the background. After this, the astral seemed to coincide with the body; but consciousness of the astral surroundings was still clear. Continued to raise consciousness, and to send out thoughts of Love. Perceived around me innumerable streams of thought, interlacing and like a net-work, and when the Love-thought was sent out, the whole net sparkled, as with little specks of gold.

I approached him, and said: ìWhy writest thou, Father ?ì and he replied ìThat those who read may live.î (I seem to have asked him another question, but cannot remember what.)

And you have the Root of the Matter in you. These are your-dangers. (1) You are emotional. This is very bad, and must be got rid of. Itís a form of Egoism, and leads to the Left-hand Path. You say: ìI object to my wife being run over by a motor-car,î and think you are stating an Eternal Truth. Now no elephant in Siam cares whether she is run over or not. Say then: ìIt is (relatively to V.I.O.) right that he should object, etc., etc.î Use this analysis with all emotions. Donít allow yourself to think that your own point of view is the only one. Read Liber LXV, Cap. I: 32ó40 and 57ó61. This is extremely important: for one thing, if you fail to understand, you will go mad when you come to a certain Gate. (2) You are inclined to vagueness. This is evidently partly caused by the fog of emotion. Before you can pass to Zelator, you must know and rule the Astral Plane throughout. Astral journeys, however interesting and even splendid and illuminating, donít count unless they are willed. If you want to go to your office, and find yourself at the Town Hall instead, itís no excuse that the Town Hall has fine columns! You should drop all ìMeditations on Love.î Whatís the matter with Hate, anyway? From beyond the Abyss, they look as like each other as two new pennies. You really mean ìReflection on Loveî: ìJonesí Night Thoughtsî: ìIdle thoughts of an idle fellow.î Itís a soul-destroying, mind-fuddling practice. If indulged in, it will absolutely ruin all power of concentration. Now here is your Examination for the Grade of Zelator.9 (a) Go through a door on which is engraved this figure and explain the figure in detail by means of your visions. (b) Invoke Mercury and Hod, and travel till you meet the Unicorn mentioned in Liber LXV, Cap. III, verse 2. Report its conversation fully.    8 [This sort of thing is all wrong. It isnít really meditation at all. You let your mind rove about, instead of pinning it down to a single, simple object.

You wouldnít allow your wife to come to the office and talk: you must make her respect your hour of work at home. Here I foresee trouble: with rarest exceptions a woman objects to a man doing anything of which she is not the centre. His business is only allowable because it provides for her. Herein no compromise is possible. You must be master or slave; and the truest kindness is to be master once and for all, whatever the cost.óO.M.

He is about to confront the denizens of the Astral World, menacing or seducing in turn; and, following the bold Rosicrucian rule, he remains in the current of life, without the safeguard of an absolute external retirement and renunciation, such as is advocated by Eastern teachers.

Let Us remind you that this is a magical formula of cosmic scope, and that it is given in exact detail in the legend of the Golden Fleece. Jason, who in this story represents the Beast, first fits out a ship guided by Wisdom or Athena, and this is his aspiration to the Great Work. Accompanied by many heroes, he comes to the place of the Fleece, but they can do nothing until Medea, the Scarlet Woman, puts into his hands a posset ìdrugged with somnolence, Sleepy with poppy and white helleboreî for the dragon. Then Jason is able to subdue the bulls, sacred to Osiris, and symbolical of his ∆on and the Magical Formula of Self-Sacrifice.

Nay! but to the glory of Ra-hoor-Khuit and the establishment of His perfect kingdom let all be done! Now, O my son, thou knowest that it is Our will to establish this Work, accomplishing fully that which We are commanded in The Book of the Law, ìHelp me, O warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men!îóand it is Thy will, manifesting as thou hast done in the Sphere of Malkuth the material world, to do this same thing in an even more immediate and practical way than would naturally appeal to one whose manifestation is in the Heaven of Jupiter.

Direct therefore now most closely thine attention to The Book of the Law itself. In It we find an absolute rule of life, and clear instruction in every emergency that may befall. What then are Its own directions for the fructification of That Ineffable Seed?

Therefore doubt not, but strike with all thy strength. Note also, pray thee, this word: ìthe Law is for all.î Do not therefore ëselect suitable personsí in thy worldly wisdom; preach openly the Law to all men. In Our experience We have found the most unlikely means have produced the best results; and indeed it is almost the definition of a true Magical Formula that the means should be unsuited, rationally speaking, to the end proposed. Note, pray thee, that We are bound to teach. ìHe must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.î This refers, however, as is evident from the context, to the technique of the new Magick, ìthe mantras and the spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword.î Note, pray thee, the instruction in CCXX I:41-44, 51, 61, 63, k.t.l. on which We have enlarged in Our tract The Law of Liberty, and in private letters to thee and others. The open preaching of this Law, and the practice of these precepts, will arouse discussion and animosity, and thus place thee upon a rostrum whence thou mayest speak unto the people. Note, pray thee, this mentor: ìRemember ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but shadows; they pass and are done; but there is that which remains.î For this doctrine shall comfort many. Also there is this word: ìThey shall rejoice, our chosen; who sorroweth is not of us.

Note, pray thee, that in the matter of direct instruction there is enough. Consider the passage ìChoose ye an island! Fortify it! Dung it about with enginery of war! I will give you a war-engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the Law of the Battle of Conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house.î The last phrase suggests that the island may be Great Britain, with its Mines and Tanks; and it is notable that a certain brother obligated to A∴A∴ is in the most secret of Englandís War Councils at this hour. But it is possible that this instruction refers to some later time when our Law, administered by some such Order as the O.T.O. which concerns itself with temporal affairs, is of weight in the councils of the world, and is challenged by the heathen, and by the followers of the fallen gods and demigods. Note, pray thee, the practical method of overcoming opposition given in CCXX III:23-26. But this is not to Our immediate purpose in this epistle. Note, pray thee, the instruction in the 38th and 39th verses of the Third Chapter of The Book of the Law. It must be quoted in full. ìSo that thy light is in me; and its red flame is as a sword in my hand to push thy order.î That is, the God himself is aflame with the Light of the Beast, and will himself push the order, through the fire (perhaps meaning the genius) of The Beast.

I am thy Theban, O Mentu, The prophet Ankh-f-na-khonsu! By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell. Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit! Bid me within thine House to dwell, O wingËd snake of light, Hadit! Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!î In the comment in Equinox I (7) this passage is virtually ignored. It is possible that this ìsecret doorî refers to the four men and four women spoken of later in The Paris Working, or it may mean the child elsewhere predicted, or some secret preparation of the hearts of men. It is difficult to decide on such a point, but we may be sure that the Event will show that the exact wording was so shaded as to prove to us absolute foreknowledge on the part of That Most Holy Angel who uttered the Book. Note, pray thee, further, in verse 39, how the matter proceeds: ìAll this Öîói.e. The Book of the Law itself. ìÖ and a book to say how thou didst come hither Öî i.e. some record such as that in The Temple of Solomon the King"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 178 ìÖ and a reproduction of this ink and paper for ever Öî i.e. by some mechanical process, with possibly a sample of paper similar to that employed. ìófor it is in the word secret and not only in the Englishóî Compare CCXX III:47, 73.

There is to be a modern centralized business organization at the Kaabaówhich, We think, does not mean Boleskine, but any convenient headquarters.

We may aid men to strike off their own fetters, but those who prefer slavery must be allowed to do so. ìThe slaves shall serve.î The excellence of the Law must be showed by its results upon those who accept it. When men see us as the hermits of Hadit described in CCXX II:24 they will determine to emulate our joy. Note, pray thee, the whole implication of the chapter that sooner or later we are to break the power of the slave-gods by actual fighting. Ultimately, Freedom must rely upon the sword. It is impossible to treat in this epistle of the vast problems involved in this question; and they must be decided in accordance with the Law by those in authority in the Order when the time comes. Thou wilt note that We have written unto thee more as a member of the O.T.O. than in thy capacity as of the A∴A∴, for the former organization is coˆrdinate and practical, and concerns itself with material things. But remember this clearly, that the Law cometh from the A∴A∴, not from the O.T.O. This Order is but the first of the great religious bodies to accept this Law officially, and its whole Ritual has been revised and reconstituted in accordance with this decision. Now then, leaving The Book of the Law, note, pray thee, the following additional suggestions for extending the Dominion of the Law of Thelema throughout the whole world. 1. All those who have accepted the Law should announce the same in daily intercourse. ìDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Lawî shall be the invariable form of greeting. These words, especially in the case of strangers, should be pronounced in a clear, firm, and articulate voice, with the eyes frankly fixed upon the hearer. If the other be of us, let him reply ìLove is the law, love under will.î The"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 180 latter sentence shall also be used as the greeting of farewell. In writing, wherever greeting is usual, it should be as above, opening ìDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.î, and closing ìLove is the law, love under will.î 2. Social gatherings should be held as often as is con-venient, and there the Law should be read and explained. 3. The special tracts written by Us, or authorized by Us, should be distributed to all persons with whom those who have accepted the Law may be in contact. 4. Pending the establishment of other Universities and Schools of Thelema, scholarships and readerships and such should be provided in existing Schools and Universities, so as to secure the general study of Our writings, and those authorized by Us as pertaining to the New ∆on. 5. All children and young people, although they may not be able to understand the more exalted heavens of our horoscope, may always be taught to rule their lives in accordance with the Law. No efforts should be spared to bring them to this emancipation. The misery caused to children by the operation of the law of the slave-gods was, one may say, the primum mobile of Our first aspiration to overthrow the Old Law. 6. By all manner of means shall all strive constantly to increase the power and freedom of the Headquarters of the O.T.O.; for thereby will come efficiency in the promulgation of the Law. Specific instructions for the extension of the O.T.O. are given in another epistle. Constant practice of these recommendations will develop skill in him or her that practiseth, so that new ideas and plans will be evolved continually. Furthermore, it is right that each and every one bind himself with an Oath Magical that he may thus make Freedom"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"LIBER CCC 181 perfect, even by a bond, as in ìLiber IIIî it is duly written. Amen. Now, son, note, pray thee, in what house We write these words. For it is a little cottage of red and green, by the western side of a great lake, and it is hidden in the woods. Man, therefore, is at odds with Wood and Water; and being a magician bethinketh Himself to take one of these enemies, Wood, which is both the effect and cause of that excess of Water, and compel it to fight for Him against the other. What then maketh He? Why, He taketh unto himself Iron of Mars, an Axe and a Saw and a Wedge and a Knife, and He divideth Wood therewith against himself, hewing him into many small pieces, so that he hath no longer any strength against His will. Good; then taketh He the Fire of our Father the Sun, and setteth it directly in battle array against that Water by His army of Wood that he hath conquered and drilled, building it up into a phalanx like unto a Cone, that is the noblest of all solid figures, being the Image of the Holy Phallus itself, and combined in himself the Right Line and the Circle. Thus, son, dealeth He; and the Fire kindleth the Wood, and the heat thereof driveth the Water afar off. Yet this Water is a cunning adversary, and He strengthened Wood against Fire by impregnating him with much of his own substance, as it were by spies in the citadel of an ally that is not wholly trusted. Now then therefore what must the Magician do? He must first expel utterly Water from Wood by an invocation of the Fire of the Sun our Father.

The inspiration is ours, and ours is the Law of Thelema that shall set the world ablaze. And We have many small dry sticks, that kindle quickly and burn through quickly, leaving the larger Wood unlit. And the great logs, the masses of humanity, are always with us. But our edged need is of those middle fagots that on the one hand are readily kindled by the small Wood, and on the other endure until the great logs blaze.

This is the central idea of the religion of the Old ∆on, but we have left it behind us because although it seemed to be based on Nature (and Natureís symbols are always true), yet we have outgrown this idea which is only apparently true in Nature. Since this great Ritual of Sacrifice and Death was conceived and perpetuated, we, through the observation of our men of science, have come to know that it is not the Sun which rises and sets, but the earth on which we live which revolves so that its shadow cuts us off from the sunlight during what we call night. The Sun does not die, as the ancients thought; it is always shining, always radiating Life and Life. Stop for a moment and get a clear conception of this Sun, how He is shining in the early morning, shining at mid-day, shining in the evening, and shining at night. Have you got this idea clearly in your minds? You have stepped out of the Old ∆on and into the New. Now let us consider what has happened. In order to get this mental picture of the ever shining Sun, what did you do? You identified yourself with the Sun. You stepped out of the consciousness of this planet; and for a moment you had to consider yourself as a Solar Being. Then why step back again? You may have done so involuntarily, because the Light was so great that it seemed as Darkness. But do it again, this time more fully, and let us consider what the changes in our concept of the Universe will be.

Then, from this height we look back upon the little planet Earth, of which we, a moment ago, were part, and think of ourselves as shedding our Light upon all those individuals we have called our brothers and sisters, the slaves that serve. But we do not stop there. Imagine the Sun concentrating His rays for a moment on one tiny spot, the Earth. What happens? It is burnt up, it is consumed, it disappears. But in our Solar Consciousness is Truth, and though we glance for a moment at the little sphere we have left behind us, and it is no more, yet there is ìthat which remains.î What remains? What has happened? We realize that ìevery man and every woman is a star.î We gaze around at our wider heritage, we gaze at the Body of Our Lady Nuit. We are not in darkness; we are much nearer to Her now.

There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. Yet it is well for Brethren to study daily in the Volume of the Sacred Law, Liber Legis, for therein is much counsel concerning this, how they may best carry out this will. SECOND HOUSE. 2. The private purse of every Brother should always be at the disposal of any Brother who may be in need. But is such a case it is a great mischief if the one ask, and the other consent; for if the former be really in need, his pride is wounded by his asking; and if not, the door is opened to beggars and impostors, and all manner of arrant knaves and rogues such as are no true Brethren. But the Brother who is possessed of this worldís goods should make it his business to watch the necessity of all those Brethren with whom he may be personally acquainted, anticipating their wants in so wise and kindly and delicate a manner that it shall appear as if it were the payment of a debt. And what help is given shall be given with discretion, so that the relief may be permanent instead of temporary. 3. All Brethren shall be exceedingly punctual in the payment of Lodge Dues. This is to take precedence over all other calls upon the purse. THIRD HOUSE. 4. The Brethren shall be diligent in preaching the Law of Thelema.

They shall respond heartily to every summons of the Lodge or Chapter to which they may belong, not lightly making excuse. 6. Brethren should use every opportunity of assisting each other in their tastes, businesses, or professions, whether by direct dealing with Brethren in preference to others, or by speaking well of them, or as may suggest itself. It seems desirable, when possible, what where two or more Brethren of the same Lodge are engaged in the same work, they should seek to amalgamate the same by entering into partnership. Thus in time great and powerful corporations may arise from small individual enterprises. 7. They shall be diligent in circulating all tracts, manifestos, and all other communications which the Order may from time to time give out for the instruction or emancipation of the profane. 8. They may offer suitable books and pictures to the Libraries of the Profess-Houses of the Order. FOURTH HOUSE 9. Every Brother who may possess mines, land, or houses more than he can himself constantly occupy, should donate part of such mines or land, or one or more of such houses to the order. 10. Property thus given will be administered if he desire it in his own interest, thus effecting a saving, since large estates are more economically handled than small. But the Order will use such property as may happen to lie idle for the moment in such ways as it may seem good, lending an unlet house (for example) to some Brother who is in need, or allowing an unused hall to be occupied by a Lodge."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"LIBER CI 213 11. (Yet in view of the great objects of the Order, endowment is welcome). 12. Every Brother shall show himself solicitous of the comfort and happiness of any Brother who may be old, attending not only to all material wants, but to his amusement, so that his declining years may be made joyful. FIFTH HOUSE 13. Every Brother shall seek constantly to give pleasure to all Brethren with whom he is acquainted, whether by entertainment or conversation, or in any other manner that may suggest itself. It will frequently and naturally arise that love itself springs up between members of the Order, for that they have so many and so sacred interests in common. Such love is peculiarly holy, and is to be encouraged. 14. All children of Brethren are to be considered as children of the whole Order, and to be protected and aided in every way be its members severally, as by its organization collectively. No distinction is to be made with regard to the conditions surrounding the birth of any child. 15. There is an especially sacred duty, which every Brother should fulfil, with regard to all children, those born within the Order included. This duty is to instruct them in the Law of Thelema, to teach them independence and freedom of thought and character, and to warn them that servility and cowardice are the most deadly diseases of the human soul.

They, on their part, will render willing and intelligence service. 18. While in Lodge, and on special occasions, they are to be treated as Brothers, with perfect equality; such behaviour is undesirable during the hours of service, and familiarity, subversive as it is of all discipline and order, is to be avoided by adopting a complete and marked change of manner and address. 19. This applies to all persons in subordinate positions, but not to the Brethren Servient in the Profess-Houses of the Order, who, giving service without recompense, are to be honoured as hosts. 20. In the case of the sickness of any Brother, it is the duty of all Brethren who know him personally to attend him, to see that he want for nothing, and to report if necessary his needs to the Lodge, or to Grand Lodge itself. 21. Those Brethren who happen to be doctors or nurses will naturally give their skill and care with even more than their customary joy in service. 22. All Brethren are bound by their fealty to offer their service in their particular trade, business, or profession, to the Grand Lodge. For example, a stationer will supply Grand Lodge with paper, vellum, and the like; a bookseller offer any books to the Library of Grand Lodge which the Librarian may desire to possess; a lawyer will execute any legal business for Grand Lodge, and a railway or steamship owner or director see to it that the Great Officers travel in comfort wherever they may wish to go.

Neglect to insist upon this leads frequently to serious trouble for both parties, especially the uninitiate. 25. Lawsuits between members of the Order are absolutely forbidden, on pain of immediate expulsion and loss of all privileges, even of those accumulated by past good conduct referred to in the second part of the instruction. 26. All disputes between Brethren should be referred firstly to the Master or Masters of their Lodge or Lodges in confidence; if a composition be not arrived at in this manner, the dispute is to be referred to the Grand Tribunal, which will arbitrate thereon, and its decision is to be accepted as final. 27. Refusal to apply for or accept such decision shall entail expulsion from the Order, and the other party is then at liberty to seek his redress in the Courts of Profane Justice. 28. Members of the Order are to regard those without its pale as possessing no rights of any kind, since they have not accepted the Law, and are therefore, as it were, troglodytes, survivals of a past civilisation, and to be treated accordingly. Kindness should be shown towards them, as towards any other animal, and every effort should be made to bring them into Freedom."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 216 29.

The accused Brother will, however, be defended by the Order to the utmost of its power on his affirming his innocence upon the Volume of the Sacred Law in the Ordeal appointed ad hoc by the Grand Tribunal itself. 32. Public enemies of the country of any Brother shall be treated as such while in the field, and slain or captured as the officer of the Brother may command. But within the precincts of the Lodge all such divisions are to be forgotten absolutely; and as children of One Father the enemies of the hour before and the hour after are to dwell in peace, amity, and fraternity. EIGHTH HOUSE 33. Every Brother is expected to bear witness in his last will and testament to the great benefit that he hath received from the Order by bestowing upon it part or the whole of his goods, as he may deem fit. 34.

Every Brother is expected to send a great part of his spare time in the study of the principles of the Law and of the Order, and in searching out the key to its great and manifold mysteries. 36. He should also do all in his power to spread the Law, especially taking long journeys, when possible, to remote places, there to sow the seed of the Law. TENTH HOUSE 37. All pregnant women are especially sacred to members of the Order, and no effort should be spared to bring them to acceptance of the Law of Freedom, so that the unborn may benefit by that impression.

Colleges of the Order will presently be established where the children of its members may be trained in all trades, businesses, and professions, and there they may study the liberal arts and humane letters, as well as our holy and arcane science.

Every Brother is expected to do all in his power to induce his personal friends to accept the Law and join the Order. He should therefore endeavour to make new friends outside the Order for the purpose of widening its scope. TWELFTH HOUSE 43. The Brethren are bound to secrecy only with regard to the nature of the rituals of our Order, and to our words, signs, etc. The general principles of the Order may be fully explained, so far as they are understood below the VI∞; as it is written, ìThe ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the Law is for all.î It is to be observed that the punctual performance of these duties, so that the report thereof is noted abroad and the fame of it cometh even unto the Throne of the Supreme and"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"LIBER CI 219 Holy King himself, will weigh heavily in the scale when it comes to be a question of the high advancement of a Brother in the Order.

The first and greatest of all privileges of a Brother is to be a Brother, to have accepted the Law, to have become free and independent, to have destroyed all fear; whether of custom, or of faith, or of other men, or of death itself. In other papers the joy and glory of those who have accepted the Book of the Law as the sole rule of life is largely, though never fully, explained; and we will not here recapitulate the same. SECOND HOUSE 45. All Brethren who may fall into indigence have a right to the direct assistance of the Order up to the full amount of fees and subscriptions paid by them up to the time of application. This will be regarded as a loan, but no interest will be charged upon it. That this privilege may not be abused, the Grand Tribunal will decide whether or no such application is made in good faith. THIRD HOUSE 46. Members of the Order will be permitted to use the Library of any of our Profess-Houses. 47. Circulating Libraries will presently be established. 48.

In sickness all Brethren have the right to medical or surgical care and attendance from any Brethren of the Lodge who may be physicians, surgeons, or nurses. 58.

My Dear Sir,ó Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I was glad to receive your letter of inquiry with regard to the Message of the Master Therion. It struck you naturally enough that on the surface there is little distinction between the New Law and the canon of Anarchy; and you ask, ìHow is the Law to be fulfilled in the case of two boys who want the same orange?î But since only one boy (at most) can eat the orange, it is evident that one of them is mistaken in supposing that it is essential to his Will to eat it. The question is to be decided in the good old way by fighting for it. All that we ask is that the fighting be done chivalrously, with respect to the courage of the vanquished. ìAs brothers fight ye!î In other words, there is only this difference from our present state of society, that manners are improved. There are many persons who are naturally slaves, who have no stomach to fight, who tamely"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 228 yield all to any one strong enough to take it. This also is understood and provided for in The Book of the Law: ìthe slaves shall serve.î But it is possible for any apparent slave to prove his mastery by fighting his oppressors, even as now; but he has this additional chance in our system, that his conduct will be watched with kindly eye by our authorities, and his prowess rewarded by admission to the ranks of the master-class. Also, he will be given fair play. You may now ask how such arrangements are possible. There is only one solution to this great problem. It has always been admitted that the ideal form of government is that of a ìbenevolent despot,î and despotisms have only fallen because it is impossible in practice to assure the goodwill of those in power. The rules of chivalry, and those of Bushido in the East, gave the best chance to develop rulers of the desired type. Chivalry failed principally because it was confronted with new problems; today we know perfectly what those problems were, and are able to solve them. It is generally understood by all men of education that the general welfare is necessary to the highest development of the particular; and the troubles of America are in great part due to the fact that the men in power are often utterly devoid of all general education. I would call your attention to the fact that many monastic orders, both in Asia and in Europe, have succeeded in surviving all changes of government, and in securing pleasant and useful lves for their members. But this has been possible only because restricted life was enjoined. However, there were orders of military monks, like the Templars, who grew and prospered exceedingly. You recall that the Order of the Temple was only overthrown by a"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXI 229 treacherous coup díÈtat on the part of a King and of a Pope who saw their reactionary, obscurantist, and tyrannical programme menaced by those knights who did not scruple to add the wisdom of the East to their own large interpretation of Christianity, and who represented in that time a movement towards the light of learning and of science, which has been brought to fruition in our own times by the labours of the Orientalist from Von Hammer-Purgstall and Sir William Jones to Professer Rhys Davids and Madame Blavastsky, to say nothing of such philosophers as Schopenhauer, on the one hand; and by the heroic efforts of Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, and Spencer, on the other. I have no sympathy with those who cry out against property, as if what all men desire were of necessity evil; the natural instinct of every man is to own, and while man remains in this mood, attempts to destroy property must not only be nugatory, but deleterious to the community. There is no outcry against property where wisdom and kindness administer it. The average man is not so unreasonable as the demagogue, for his own selfish ends, pretends to be. The great nobles of all time have usually been able to create a happy family of their dependents, and unflinching loyalty and devotion have been their reward. The secret has been principally this, that they considered themselves noble in nature as well as name, and thought it foul shame to themselves if any retainer met unnecessary misfortune. The upstart of today lacks this feeling; he must constantly try to prove his superiority by exhibiting his power, and harshness is his only weapon. In any society where each person has his allotted place, and that a place with its own special honour, mutual respect and self-respect are born. Every man is in his own way a king, or at least heir to some kingdom. We have"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 230 many examples of such society today, notably universities and all associations of sport. No. 5 in the Harvard crew does not turn round in the middle of the race and reproach No. 4 for being merely No. 4; nor do the pitcher and catcher of a crack baseball nine revile each other because their tasks are different. It is to be noted that wherever teamwork is necessary social cooperation is essential. The common soldier is invested with a uniform as well as his officer, and in any properly trained army he is taught his own canons of honour and self-respect. This feeling, more than mere discipline or the possession of weapons, makes the soldier more than a match morally for a man not so clothed in proper reverence for humself and his profession. University men who have passed through some crisis of hardship or temptation have often told me that the backbone of their endurance was the ìold shop.î Much of this is evidently felt by those who talk of re-establishing the old trade guilds. But I fear I digress. I have, however, now placed before you the main points of my thesis. We need to extend to the whole of society the peculiar feeling which obtains in our most successful institutions, such as the services, the universities, the clubs. Heaven and hell are states of mind; and if the devil be really proud, his hell can hurt him little. It is this, then, that I desire to emphasize: those who accept the New Law, the Law of the ∆on of Horus, the crowned and conquering child who replaces in our theogony the suffering and despairing victim of destiny, the Law of Thelema, which is Do What Thou Wilt, those who accept it (I say) feel themselves immediately to be kings and queens."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXI 231 ìEvery man and every woman is a starî is the first statement of the Book of the Law.

You will say swiftly that the heavenly state of mind thus induced will be hard put to it to endure hunger and cold. The though occurred also to our founder, and I will endeavour to put before you the skeleton of his plan to avert such misfortune (or at least such ordeal) from his adherents. In the first place, he availed himself of a certain organization of which he was offered control, namely the O.T.O. This great Order accepted the Law immediately, and was justified by the sudden and great revival of its activities. The Law was given to our founder twelve years ago; the O.T.O. came into his hands eight years later, in the vulgar year 1912. It must not be supposed that he was idle during the former period, but he was very young, and had no idea of taking practical measures to extend the dominion of the Law: he pursued his studies. However, with the sudden growth of the O.T.O. from 1912 e.v. onward, he began to perceive a method of putting the Law into general practice, of making it possible for men and women to live in accordance with the precepts laid down in the Book of the Law, and to accomplish their wills; I do not say to gratify their passing fancies, but to do that for which they were intended by their own high destiny.

I am well aware that from this point you could draw me subtly over the tiger-trap of the Freewill Controversy; you would make it difficult for me even to say that it is better to fulfil oneís destiny consciously and joyously than like a stone; but I am on my guard. I will return to plain politics and common sense. Our Founder, then, when he thought over this matter from a purely practical standpoint, remembered those institutions with which he was familiar, which flourished. He bethought him of monasteries like Monsalvat, of universities like Cambridge, of golf clubs like Hoylake, of social clubs like the Cocoa-Tree, of co-operative societies, and, having sojourned in America, of Trusts. In his mind he expanded each of these to its nth power, he blended them like the skilled chemist that he was, he considered their excellences and their limitations; in a word, he meditated profoundly upon the whole subject, and he concluded with the vision of a perfect society. He saw all men free, all men wealthy, all men respected; and he planted the seed of his Utopia by handing over his own house to the O.T.O., the organization which should operate his plan, under certain conditions. What he had foreseen occurred; he had possessed one house; by surrendering it he became owner of a thousand houses. He gave up the world, and found it at his feet.

It will be seen that our founder, born as he was to the purple, has fulfilled it. I have not the volume at my side, living as I am this hermit life in New Hampshire, but its gist is that Kings and Popes have not power to redeem the world because they surround themselves with splendour and dignity. They possess all that other men desire, and therefore their motives are suspect. If any person of position, says LÈvi, insists upon living a life of hardship and inconvenience when he could do otherwise, then men will trust him, and he will be able to execute his projects for the general good of the commenwealth. But he must naturally be careful not to relax his austerities as his power increases. Make power and splendour incompatible, and the social problem is solved. ìWho is that ragged man gnawing a dry crust by yonder cabin?î ìThat is the President of the Republic.î Where honour is the only possible good to be gained by the exercise of power, the man in power will strive only for honour. The above is an extreme case; no one need go so far nowadays; and it is important that the President should have been used to terrapin and bÈcasse flambÈ before he went into politics. You will ask how this is operated, and how the system inaugurated by him works. It is simple. Authority and prestige in the Order are absolute, but while the lower grades give increase of privilege, the higher give increase of service. Power in the Order depends, therefore, directly on the willingness to aid others. Tolerance also is taught in the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 234 higher grades; so that no man can be even an Inspector of the Order unless he be equally well disposed to all classes of opinion. You may have six wives or none; but if you have six, you are required not to let them talk all at once, and if you have none, you are required to refrain from boring people with dithyrambs upon your own virtue. This tolerance is taught by a peculiar course of instruction whose nature it would be imprudent as well as impertinent to disclose; I will ask you to accept my word that it is efficient. With this provision, it is easy to see that intolerance and snobbery are impossible; for the example set by members of the universally respected higher grades is against this. I may add that members are bound together by participation in certain mysteries, which lead to a synthetic climax in which a single secret is communicated whose nature is such as to set at rest for ever all division on those fertile causes of quarrel, sex and religion. The possession of this secret gives the members entitled to it such calm of authority that the perfect respect which is their due never fails them. Thus, then, you see brethren dwelling together in unity; and you wonder whether the lust of possession may not cause division. On the contrary, this matter has been the excellent cause of general prosperity. In the majority of cases property is wasted. One has six houses; three remain unlet. One has 20 per cent. of the stock of a certain company; and is frozen out by the person with 51 per cent. There are a thousand dangers and drawbacks to the possession of this worldís goods which thin the hairs of those who cling to them."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"LIBER CLXI 235 In the O.T.O. all this trouble is avoided. Such property as any member of the Order wills is handed over to the Great Officers either as a gift, or in trust. In the latter case it is administered in the interest of the donor. Property being thus pooled, immense economies are effected. One lawyer does the work of fifty; house agents let houses instead of merely writing misleading entries in books; the O.T.O. controls the company instead of half-a-dozen isolated and impotent stockholders. Whatever the O.T.O. findeth to do, it does with all its might; none dare oppose the power of a corporation thus centralised, thus ramified. To become a member of the O.T.O. is to hitch your wagon to a star. But if you are poor? If you have no property? The O.T.O. still helps you. There will always be unoccupied houses which you can tend rent-free; there is certainty of employment, if you desire it, from other members. If you keep a shop, you may be sure that O.T.O. members will be your customers; if you are a doctor or lawyer, they will be your clients. Are you sick? The other members hasten to your bed to ask of what you are in need. Do you need company? The Profess-Housse of the O.T.O. is open to you. Do you require a loan?

You reply that this can only be by generosity, by divine charity of the high toward the low, of the rich toward the poor, of the great toward the small. You are a thousand times right; you have understood the secret of the O.T.O. That such qualities can flourish in an extended community may surprise so eminent and profound a student of humanity as yourself; yet examples abound of practices the most unnatural and repugnant to mankind which have continued through centuries. I need not remind you of Jaganath and of the priests of Attis, for extreme cases. A fortiori, then, it must be possible to train men in independences, to tolerance, to nobility of character, and to good manners, and this is done in the O.T.O. by certain very efficacious methods which (for I will not risk further wearying you) I will not describe. Besides, they are secret. But beyond them is the supreme incentive; advancement in the Order depends almost entirely on the possession of such qualities, and is impossible without it. Power being the main desire of man, it is only necessary so to condition its possession that it be not abuse. Wealth is of no account in the O.T.O.

He may travel, for instance, as a railway magnate travels; but he cannot injure the commonwealth by setting his private car athwart the four main lines. Even intellectual eminence and executive ability are at a certain discount in the Order. Work is invariably found for persons possessing these qualifications, and they attain high status and renown for their reward; but not advancement in the Order; unless they exhibit a talent for government, and this will be exhibited far more by nobility of character, firmness and suavity, tact and dignity, high honour and good manners, those qualities (in short) which are, in the best minds, natural predicates of the word gentleman. The knowledge of this fact not only inspires confidence in the younger members, but induces them to emulate their seniors. In order to appreciate the actual working of the system, it is necessary to visit our Profess-Houses. (It is hoped that some will shortly be established in the United States of America.) Some are like the castles of medieval barons, some are simple cottages; the same spirit rules in all. It is that of perfect hospitality. Each one is free to do as he will; and the luxury of this enjoyment is such that he becomes careful to avoid disturbance of the equal right of others. Yet, the authority of the Abbot of the house being supreme, any failure to observe this rule is met with appropriate energy. The case cannot really arise, unless circumstasnces are quite beyond the ordinary, for the period of hospitality is strictly limited, and extensions depend on the goodwill of the Abbot.

This is the Constitution and Government of our Holy Order: by the study of its Balance you may yourself come to apprehension of how to rule your own life. For, in True Things, all are but images of one another; man is but a map of the universe, and Society is but the same on a large scale. Learn then that our Holy Order has but Three True Grades; as it is written in The Book of the Law: The Hermit, The Lover, and the Man of Earth. It is but for convenience that these grades have been separated into Three Triads. The Third Triad consists of the degrees from Minerval to Prince of Jerusalem. The Minerval degree is a Prologue to the First; the degrees subsequent to the Third but pendants to it. In this, the Man of Earth series, there are then but Three Degrees; and these Three are One. The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of the Order; for he is not yet called upon to give his life to it in service; and with us Government is Service, and nothing else. The Man of Earth is therefore in much the position of the Plebian in Rome in the time of Menenius Agrippia. But there is this marked difference; that every Man of Earth is encouraged and expected to push on to the next stage. In order that the feelings of the general body may be represented, the Men of Earth choose four persons, two men and two women, from among themselves, to stand continually before the face of the Supreme and Holy King, serving him day and night. These persons must not be of higher rank than the Second Degree; they must volunteer for this service at the conclusion of that ceremony; and therefore they give up their own prospect of advancement in"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 242 the Order for one year, that they may serve their fellows. This is then the first lesson in our great principle, the attainment of honour through renunciation. The degree of Knights of East and West is but a bridge between the first and second series; but it is important, for in that grade a new pledge-form must be signed, and the new Knight vowed to devote his life to the Establishment of the Law of Thelema. The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that concerns the Social Welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically that of beauty and harmony; it is the natural stopping-place of the majority of men and women; for to proceed farther, as will appear, involves renunication of the sternest kind. Here then is all joy, peace, well-being on all planes; the Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower, and forms a natural link between them. Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on high. In this degree the Most Wise Sovereign of each chapter will appoint a committee of four persons, two men and two women, to arrange for all social gatherings, banquets, dances, the performance of plays, and similar pleasures. They will also endeavour to promote harmony among the Brethren in all possible ways, and to compose any disputes by tact and friendliness without formal appeal being made to any more authoritative tribunal. The next grade, that which lies between the Fifth and Sixth Degrees, is called the Senate. This is the first of the governing bodies, properly speaking, and here we begin to insist upon Renunciation. For within this body is the Electoral College of the O.T.O. The principle of popular election is a fatal folly; its results are visible in every so-called democracy. The elected man is always the mediocrity; he is the safe man, the sound man, the man who displeases the majority less than any other; and therefore never the genius, the man of progress and illumination. This Electoral College consists of Eleven Persons in each country. It has full control of the affairs of the Men of Earth, appointing Lodge Masters at will. It has however no authority over Chapters of Rose Croix. Persons who wish to be appointed to this College by the Supreme and Holy King must volunteer for the office. The appointment is for Eleven Years. Volunteers must renounce for that period all further progress in the Order. They must give evidence of first-rate ability in (i) Some branch of athletics. (ii) Some branch of learning. They must also possess a profound general knowledge of history and of the art of government, with some attention to philosophy in general."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"LIBER CXCIV 243 They must each live in solitude, without more than the necessary speech even to casual neighbours, serving themselves in all respects, for three months continuously, once at least in every two years. The President will summon them at the four seasons of the year, and if necessary at other times, when they will deliberate upon the affairs placed in their charge. All applications to pass to the Fifth Degree must receive their sanction. Appeal from their decisions may however be made to the Supreme Council. The Sixth Degree is an executive or military body, and represents the temporal power of the Supreme and Holy King. Each member is amenable to military discipline. Singly or in concert with his comrades, each Knight is vowed to enforce the descisions of authority. The Grade of Grand Inquisitor Commander follows. Here every member has a right to a seat on the Grand Tribunal, which body decides all disputes and complaints which have not been composed by the Chapters of Rose Croix or the Lodge Masters. Its verdicts are without appeal, unless a member of the Electoral College give sanction to take the case to the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree. All members of the Order, even of higher grades, are subject to the Grand Tribunal. The next grade is that of Prince of the Royal Secret. Every member of this degree is devoted to the Propagation of the Law in a very special manner; for this grade is the first in which the Beginning of the Inmost Secret is de-clared openly. He will therefore, by his personal exertions, induce one hun-dred and eleven persons to join the Order, before he may proceed to the Seventh Degree, except by special order from the Supreme and Holy King. The Seventh Degree is, in military language, the Great General Staff of the Army of the Sixth Degree. From its members the Supreme and Holy King appoints a Supreme Grand Council. This Council is charged with the government of the whole of the Second Triad, or Lovers. All members of the Seventh Degree travel as Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Order, and report, on their own initiative, to the Supreme and Most Holy King, as to the condition of all Lodges, and Chapters; to the Supreme Council, on all affairs of the Second Triad; and to the Electoral College, on those of the Third. The Eighth Degree is a Philosophical Body. Its members, being fully instructed in the Principles of the Order, save in one point only, devote themselves to the understanding of what they have learned in their ini-tiation. They have power to reverse the decisions of the Grand Tribunal, and to compose all conflicts between any of the governing bodies. And this they do upon the great principles of philosophy. For it will often occur that there is a contention between two parties, both of whom are right from their own point of view. This is so important that an illustration is desirable. A man is"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 244 smitten with leprosy; is it right that men should circumscribe his liberty by isolating him from his fellows? Another holds back land or some other necessity from the common use; is he to be compelled to surrender it? Such cases of difficulty involve deep philosophical principles; and the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree is charged with the duty of resolving them in accordance with the great principles of the Order. Before the face of the Areopagus stands an independent Parliament of the Guilds. Within the Order, irrespective of grade, the members of each craft, trade, science, or profession form themselves into a Guild, make their own laws, and prosecute their own good, in all matters pertaining to their labour and means of livelihood. Each Guild chooses the man most eminent in it to represent it before the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree; and all disputes between the various Guilds are argued before that Body, which will decide according to the grand principles of the Order. Its decisions pass for ratification to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, and thence to the Throne. Epopts and Pontiffs of this exalted grade are bound to live in isolation for four consecutive months in every year, meditating the mysteries revealed to them. The Ninth Degreeóthe Sanctuary of the Gnosisóis synthetic. The prime duty of its members is to study and practice the theurgy and thaumaturgy of the grade; but in addition they must be prepared to act as direct representatives of the Supreme and Most Holy King, radiating his light upon the whole world. Yet, from the nature of their initiation, they must veil their glory in a cloud of darkness. They move unseen and unrecognized among the youngest of us, subtly and loftily leading us into the holy ineffable mysteries of the True Light. The Supreme and Most Holy King is appointed by the O.H.O. His is the ultimate responsibility for all within his holy kingdom. The succession to the high office of the O.H.O. is decided in a manner not here to be de-clared; but this you may learn, O Brother Magician, that he may be chosen even from the grade of a Minerval. And herein lieth a most sacred Mystery. The Electoral College possesses one most singular power. Every eleven years, or in the case of a vacancy occuring, they choose two persons from the Ninth Degree, who are charged with the duty of Revolution. It is the business of these persons constantly to criticse and oppose the acts of the Supreme and Most Holy King, whether or not they personally approve of them. Should he exhibit weakness, bodily, mental, or moral, they are empowered to appeal to the O.H.O. to depose him but they, alone of all the members of the Order, are not eligible to the Succession."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"LIBER CXCIV 245 The O.H.O., as the supreme authority in the Order, will act, in such an emergency, as he may see fit.

It has no relation to the general plan of the Order, is inscrutable, and dwells in its own Palaces. There are certain important financial obligations in various grades. The Electoral College of the Senate is vowed to poverty. All property, earnings, or salaries are vested in or paid over to the Grand Treasurer General. The members subsist on the charity of the Order, which is extended to them in accordance with their original rank in life. These remarks apply equally to the Supreme Grand Council and all higher degrees. In the Seventh Degree it is a qualification to vest some real property in the Order; and no one is admitted to this grade without this preliminary. Those members of the Order who have given all to it must obtain the money for their initiation fees and subscriptions from the Third Triad, whose honour is thus concerned in the unselfish support of those who have abandoned all for their sakes. The Grand Treasurer General is appointed by the Supreme and Most Holy King; he may be a member of any grade whatever; but he must, on accepting office, take the vow of poverty. His authority is absolute in all financial matters; but he is responsible to, and may be removed at will by, the Supreme and Most Holy King. He will appoint a committee to assist hium and advise him in his work; and he will usually select one person from each of the governing bodies of the Order. Such is a brief outline of the government of the O.T.O. It combines monarchy with democracy: it includes aristocracy, and conceals even the seeds of revolution, by which alone progress can be effected. Thus we balance the Triads, uniting the Three in One; thus we gather up all the threads of human passion and interest, and weave them into an harmonious tapestry, subtly and diligently with great art, that our Order may seem an ornament even to the Stars that are in the Heavens at Night. In our rainbow-coloured texture we set forth the glory of the whole Universe. See to it, brother Magician, that thine own thread be strong, and pure, and of a colour brilliant in itself, yet ready to mingle in all beauty with those of thy brethren!"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 246 THE GRADES OF THE O.

THIS book is one of the most glorious blasphemies ever printed. I have long recognized in Alexander Harvey one of those extremely rare types of genius, of which, curiously enough, America seems to have a monopoly. The United States have not produced any all-round men of the first class, but they have produced quite a number of what I may call, without any intent of disparagement, monsters. Morphyís games of chess are entirely sui generis. He was different not only in kind, but in degree, from all other masters, and this, owing to the peculiar nature of the game of chess, resulted in the complete over-turning of the theory of the game. In chess problems, Sam Loyd and W. A. Shinkman displayed a precisely similar quality. Their problems are not well rounded and balanced, like those of other masters of the art. They are comparable with nothing else. One feels the emotion of a naturalist familiar with all other fauna who should suddenly be introduced to Australian zoology. In art, America has George Grey Barnard, whose Lincoln is like no other type of statue ever moulded. In vaudeville, we have Eva Tanguay, of whom I have already written in terms of no little enthusiasm. While other variety artists are like different vintages of Burgundy, Claret, Port, Champagne, and other wines, she breaks the entire series by producing cocaine. In literature, there are Poe and Whitman. Neither of these great men had the broad base of education. They have shot up by the mutation of a spiritual De Vries. Alexander Harvey reminds me constantly of Poe, but he is a Poe without the element of tragedy or morbidity; while his comic spirit is more ineffably delightful than that of any other human being, past or present, with whom I am familiar. Poeís comedy was labored, clumsy, hard-working foolery. Alexander Harveyís is perfectly spontaneous, and of such exquisite delicacy and acuteness, that he reminds one of the bistoury of a crazy surgeon. In Shelley's Elopement, he has taken Bernard Shawís formula for creating absurdity. It is a very simple formula. One reflects that Caesar was not a hero to his valet, and that sometimes his toga set awry. The joke consists in making the heroic figure ridiculous by making him real. Shawís method is mere clowning. Alexander Harveyís is perfect artistic perception of the realities of life. In this book he shows you the characters concerned with the absolute fidelity of a Balzac."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 278 One understands instantly that one is actually present at these scenes of Shelley's life.

And this is the secret of life. This is the sublime and sacred jest of the Gods, to take the gross, the stupid, the banal, and suddenly to manifest a flower. For this reason I wish to put it upon record, that I think that Alexander Harvey is the greatest realist alive to-day.

By JAMES BRANCH CABELL. Robert M. McBride & Co. FOR four years I have been cast away upon a desert island, and I am seriously alarmed at beholding a footprint in the sand. As a matter of fact, the goats have acclimatized me to most things, and I take up the task of reviewing this book with all the more confidence, because the publisher begs me to abuse it. I dislike publishers intensely, and I am not going to abuse books merely because they ask me to, and even if I had wanted to abuse this book, I should have found myself in the position of Balaam. It is an extraordinarily good book. I quite understand why the Times says that Mr. Cabell is ìone of the most pretentiously attitudinizing of American authors.î The Times has had some. But what does the Times matter? It used to be the thunderer. It is now an imitation of thunder which only Martial could describe, or an ambitious Marine imitate. What in Godís name is an American author to do? He has got such a dreadful milieu that it is almost impossible to discover him. I never blamed the cock who failed to notice the pearl in the dung hill. Fortunately, I had Mr. Mencken to indicate Mr. Cabell. Thus, I was able to read the book as if I knew nothing of its surroundings, which is of course the only way to read a book. It is admirably written. It is a defence of romance. What does it matter that it is written among a people who think that romance means Robert W. Chambers? There are extraordinary things in this book. I do not think Mr. Cabell's irony so wonderful as his humour. He says, ìThe most prosaic of materialists proclaim that we are all descended from an insane fish, who somehow evolved the idea that it was his duty to live on land, and eventually succeeded in doing it.î Insane fish is right.

THE LADY WITH THE DOG and other Stories. THE DARLING and other Stories. THE WIFE and other Stories. THE DUEL and other Stories. THE WITCH and other Stories. Translated by CONSTANCE GARNETT. The Macmillan Co. I WAS sitting at dinner in the Brevoort with some fascinating friends when, thinking no harm, I mentioned Chekhov. A chic adolescent at the next table introduced himself. He could not really let such an occasion pass. It was so rare to hear any one speak of Chekhov. It was he who had introduced Chekhov to the notice of English readers. He almost reminded me of what Dorian Grey used to say about Wonderful Boyhood. I thought of Keats' worst sonnet, and ìChatterton, Marvellous Boy!î But the chic adolescent, who was Mr. Robert Nichols, had a bullet in his neck, which explained the whole matter immediately to my satisfaction. Mr. Nichols also told me of how he was a great poet, of how he had started the war, or won it, or both. He said that his mother was called Mary, but that Vulgar report erred in saying that his father was named Joseph. Chekhov cannot hope to compete with this sort of thing. I forgot all about him. But I do wish I had one of Mr. Nicholsí books to review. However, here is the Macmillan Chekhov, and I maun e'en go to it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Mr. Edward Garnett, with the banality which he has trained us to expect from him, remarks that ìChekhov has been termed the Russian Maupassant, and there are indeed several Vital resemblances between the outlook of the French and the Russian master.î Diving deeper into the commonplace, he continues to bore us with remarks upon ìthe art of both these unflinching realists.î Constance Garnett, one presumes, undertook the hard work of translating Russian as a relief from the intolerable boredom of her pinchbeck husband. Thus an all-wise Providence brings good from evil, for she is an excellent translator, apt to catch the spirit of a masterpiece. Of course, Chekhov is the Russian Maupassant, for every Russian is under the curse of being a Russian something-European. There is nothing genuinely Russian in art or literature, because the Russian is in the ape stage of evolution. No matter how great his genius may be, it has to be cast in the mould of that which has been already shaped.

The art of Russia has always been either without art, or with art derived. Napoleon was probably in an extremely bad temper when he spoke of Saint Basilís as ìthat mosque,î but it is a mosque. It is probably the greatest building in the world in its peculiar way, but that way is the way of the mosque, even more so than St. Markís or the cathedral at Granada. But the great Russians are not less because they have been compelled to wear civilized clothing. There is only one art purely Russian, and that is the ëRussian Ballet,í which was not invented by Russians at all. The real Russian ballet is a savage mimicry of the Italian ballet. Have you not seen those uncut emeralds, the size of a walnut, through which the Tsars bored holes to wear them on a string? In its grossest stupidities the Russian spirit is still childishly great. I suppose a Russian cook could make something tasty of Edward Garnett, as a Chinese cook makes masterpieces of puppy dogs. Chekhov is not to be judged at all by the standard of Guy de Maupassant. He is not to have his stories split up by our Garnetts or Barnetts or Darnetts into a. humorous b. indigenous c. historicalópastoralócomical etc. Each story is to be judged by itself. This is of course true of every work of art, and that is why critics are such a hang-dog race of marmots. But speaking as a marmot, which is, after all, the right of marmots, Article I in the Magna Charta of marmots, I may say that Chekhov was very much better when he was not thinking of Kopecks. He has turned out a dreadful lot of bad work under the lash of the publisher. But at his best, in stories like The Witch, he is unsurpassed. One feels a positive anguish that one has not met that witch 1 Even a Gladys Belasco or a Lea de Líame Morteóor Del Amor?ócan hardly console one for her loss.

This is an admirable edition of Chekhov, but how is it, while I am on another subject, that a firm of the standing of Macmillan can publish Chekhov (either without fear of prosecution, or because they have squared the judges) with apparent good hope of selling a great number of copies, while a native Chekhov like Alexander Harvey finds it difficult to get a publisher, and all the other American Chekhovs can never get a story printed? HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOMS. By THEODORE SCHROEDER and IDA Có. Reprinted from the Alienist and Neurologist. This book has been left entirely unedited by Mr. Theodore Schroeder, with the exception of a very brief explanatory note. I may say that it is one"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 281 of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous. She finds traces of similar beliefs in every country in the world, and (having a similar experience of her own) she can hardly be blamed for arguing that one thing confirms the other. Mr. Schroeder is quite logical in calling her paper An Unintentional Contribution to the Erotogenetic Interpretation of Religion, but commits the errors of petitio principii and non distributio medii with the most exquisite nonchalance. Only a lawyer could be so shameless. He begs the question with regard to this particular case, assuming that her relation with the angel was pure hallucination, of which he has no evidence whatever. He argues that, since one person both loves and is religious, religion is nothing but a morbid manifestation of the sexual instinct. One does not have even to disagree with him to see how worthless is his reasoning. As a matter of fact, I do half agree with him in my calmer moments in a general way, but the conclusion can be carried a step further. When you have proved that God is merely a name for the sex instinct, it appears to me not far to the perception that the sex instinct is God. This particular MS. is absolutely sane in every line. The fact that the woman committed suicide twelve or fifteen years afterwards is no more against the sanity of the MS. than the suicide of Socrates proves that the Republic is merely the lucubration of a lunatic. I am very far from agreeing with all that this most talented woman sets forth in her paper, but she certainly obtained initiated knowledge of extraordinary depth. She seems to have had access to certain most concealed sanctuaries. I should personally be inclined to attribute her suicide rather to the vengeance of the guardians of those palaces than to any more obvious cause. She has put down statements in plain English which are positively staggering. This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it. BAPHOMET. PAVANNES AND DIVISIONS. By EZRA POUND. ëMy Country, ítis o f thee.í IT is by the happiest chance that Mr. Ezra Pound's Pavannes and Divisions should have come just when Americanism is in such vogue. For Mr. Pound is, if one may be pardoned so bold a phrase in a mere review, a hundred per cent. American. He has all the American craving for rules, all the American belief in teaching and training, all the American itch for definition; he abounds in the curiously national characteristic that has made America the land of those Colleges and Correspondence Schools through which the earnest citizen may learn how to converse as though he had seen the world, make $125 a week,"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 282 never forget any name or telephone number once heard, write a short story or a Broadway Revue, draw comic cartoons, manage his wife, never look more than thirty-five, and live to be a hundred.

When all the readers and reviewers in the land should be hasting in their thousands to acclaim this ënew birth of our new soil, the first Americaníóas indeed Mr. Pound is the first Complete American high-brow, armed at all points, accoutred cap-‡-pieóinstead they persist in regarding him as an exotic, a fantastic, a new-art poseur. I suppose, because he lives in Europe, because he has written vers libre, because he has praised a man with a name like Gaudier-Brzeska. These trifling accidents do not in the least affect the essential Americanism of what he has done, and of the way in which he has done it. He began by following rules, and now he is making them. According to precept he ëcopied masterwork, and proceeded to his own Composition.í He has taken himself with the seriousness of Whittier and Tupper and Howells and Mr. Winston Churchill. His reverence for the technique and toil of art is Bostonian. When he is not either observing the law or laying it down, he is as ill at ease as a pedagogue in a bar-room. His American Puritanism nibbles his ear all the time. His hatred of what he calls rhetoric, his mania for the ëclearí and the ëhard,í his earnest belief that poetry must never be a ëpastime,í all derive from the American conscience; and so does his distaste for the Puritan poet Milton, whose extreme sensuality avenged its suppression magnificently unawares in the greater Miltonic lines. But Mr. Poundís Puritanism is too distantly inherited Like modern American Puritanism, it is a melancholy survival, drained of creative or destructive power. It is not a fierce and terrible thing, any more than the Puritanism of the modern New Englander is fierce and terrible. It nibbles at Mr. Pound, but it does not devour him; it has not strength left for that. It is not a Demogorgon, but a schoolmaster, not a victim or a priest. He has all the schoolmasterís love of the chalk and the blackboard, he has the true pedagogic flair for dogma, the true pedagogic knack of rapping it out ëclear and hardí on the board, with the ëexpertí touch under which the chalk never crumbles. No writer, you would think, could be more acceptable to the American mind, for no nation in the world believes in the schoolmaster and his methods as America believes in them, no nation venerates pedagogy so profoundly. ëBut what is the good of style,í I was asked yesterday, ëif it cannot be taught?í Mr. Pound of course would not say that a man can be taught to be a poet or a prose-writer, but he is so pathetically at the mercy of ëartistic principles,í he is so Puritanically conscious of artistic right and wrong, that he can never give us so much as a half-holiday from the Ethical Culture Hall of his Êsthetics. Whether he is making a creative appearance, as in Pavannes, or a critical appearance, as in Divisions, he has to impose upon us the propinquity of ferule and desk. Either by example or precept he must enforce the doctrine: `Look in"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 283 your note-book and write.' And like all doctrinaires, Mr. Pound is exposed to the besetting sin of the half-true or the maybe-true platitude. ëThe mastery of any art is the work of a lifetime,í for example. How about the art of lyric poetry, how about Sappho and Keats and Swinburne's early work? Again, we must have ëdirect treatment,í Mr. Pound affirms, and we must ëuse absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.í Such pronouncements are either platitudes or untrue, they either mean nothing that canít be taken for granted or a good deal that canít. The last of these ëprinciplesí is that one should ëcompose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in the sequence of a metronome.í If this means that ëMy brother John was nine in May; And I'll be twelve on New Year's dayí is not fine poetry, letís shake hands: but if it means that ëTill the maid, knowing her mother near, Sobs with love, aching with sweet fearí are not poetic lines, it means nonsense. In either case, the dictum is pointless, it leads nowhere at all. We do not need an official censure of crude and jingly rime, and we need something more than the mere comparison of the regular sequence of rime to the sequence of a metronome to disparage the genius of those great poets who happened not to write free verse. Mr. Pound himself in the Pavannes tries rime as a ëdiversion.í Líhomme Moyen Sensuel once again confirms the impression of him as a serious schoolmaster, and as an American. For he relaxes consciously, he is as conscious of his diversion as the schoolmaster is of the Norfolk suit donned for a game of golf or a fishing expedition or a trip to Paris; and in his treatment of humour as a thing by itself, a thing in a separate compartment of its own, he is intensely American, American a líoutrance. Stark Realism, another of the Pavannes pieces, proclaims this same deliberate and detached American humour, a humour that is no salt for sprinkling, but is stocked in chunks to be made a whole meal of at a time. Stark Realism might have got into The Smart Set if the manuscript had been sent there and had happened upon a hospitable editorial mood. Líhomme Moyen Sensuel is in its way a more striking affair, because the attempt to spring is so evident that one is positively startled by its not coming off. You wonder where the author has landed; and you find, quite surprisingly, that he has not landed at all. The verse is so Byronic in its demeanour that you feel there must be barbs in it somewhere; it is really a shock not to discover a single one. There is a profoundly American phrase that recurs to the reader of this book of Mr. Poundísóëgoing through the motions.í The author ëgoes through the motionsí not only in L'homme Moyen Sensuel: he is always making you"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 284 think he is about to do something, then he never does it.

Yet even about his sterility there is something engaging. He is much too American for any Englishman ever to dislike him. The Americans who rile us are the ones who are not American enough. As it is impossible to be angry with the authentic professor or the authentic American, so it is impossible to be angry with Mr. Pound. For one thing, what a simple wholesome American pleasure he culls from the use of French words and phrases! He, like all other real Americans and real professors, disarms by his naivetÈ, his earnestness, his industry, his patience. He is untiringly patient, both with other people and with himself. One sees clearly that he is a kind, and, I am sure, a good man. I do not speak ironically. This American goodness, this American patience are beautifully distinctive national qualities to which no sort of justice has yet been done by foreign observers. They should be more widely known: and Mr. Poundís Americanism should be more widely known. LOUIS WILKINSON. EVOLUTION CRITICISED. By T. B. BISHOP. Oliphants Ltd. BLOODY BILL is commonly supposed to have been somewhat severe with the Belgians. But only the `spurlos versenkt' suggestion of an admittedly insane agent of his approaches the maniacal savagery of I Samuel xv, 3, and by no means matches the undiscriminating imbecility of its ferocity: ìNow go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.î Who is the author of this order? It is the father of Jesus Christ. ìI and my father are one.î It is therefore the God of Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, the American people (if their newspapers lie not), and a very few particularly troglodytic Englishmen of whom Mr. T. B. Bishop is a striking ësurvival of the meanest.í Mr. Bishop really believes that this tribal demon designed butterflies, and put the rainbow in the sky as a guarantee that the world would never be destroyed by water. He even thinks that it once was destroyed by water! When any student of nature discovers beauty, or design, or evidence of intelligence, Mr. Bishop falls into a senile rage. He is not content with destroying his fellowman, with his wife, children, cattle, and so on; Mr. Bishop is not happy unless he is sure that they will all be roasted without cessation or hope."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 285 In the meanwhile, Mr. Bishop writes a book to prove the truth of all this prehistoric nonsense. Mr. Bishop's intelligence is very far beneath the human level. For example, he actually maintains that the claws and teeth of predatory animals have been given to them out of kindness towards their prey! You would think it was impossible for any one to miss the point of the argument that nature is cruel. The fact is that Mr. Bishop's ideas of kindness are a little crude, like his ideas of writing a book. This is not really a book at all. Itís mere scissors and paste. Its main argument is that as two men of science have differed on some minute detail of theory, there is no value in science. He does not in the least understand the subject on which he is writing. He does not understand the canon of reason. He has only one idea, which is, that the Bible (authorized translation) is literally true in every detail. His great explanation of everything that seems a little peculiar is that it is the result of sin. He claims, however, that sin was caused by the devil, who was created by God, and that God foreknew and permitted all this, in order to inflict torture upon nearly everybody except Mr. Bishop. He would however deny furiously that the God who willingly and knowingly created the devil, was in any way responsible for him. This Kaiserlich-Chautauquamericanisch-Bishopisch God is therefore an illogical impossibility and absurdity. But this doesn't detract from the unmetaphysical conception of him as a monster. Mr. Bishop is one of the best known philanthropists in England. Let us see how he acts within his family circle. Here is a quotation from a bill of costs sent in to his nephew by the family solicitor. It should be understood that the nephew in question was at the time of the transaction entitled to a considerable sum of money which was in the hands of this solicitor, and that Mr. Bishop was aware of this: ìAttending Mrs. Bishop when she informed us that Mr. Bishop had received a letter from you that you were ill and needed money and she asked whether Mr. Bishop would be safe in sending you out any and generally answering your inquiries. ìAttending Mr. T. B. Bishop on his calling when he showed us the letter from you and stated that he was cabling you out £12.î A generous impulse is sometimes regretted by the impulsive one. Mr. Bishopís motto seems to be, ìSafety First.î Many years ago, as stated in THE EQUINOX, Mr. Bishop worked his sister to death in order to spare himself the expense of a stenographer. Mr. Bishop is a man of considerable wealth, but he never allows it to injure his moral principles. The death of his sister left him with one other sister, and for her he professed the most unbounded devotion. As she lay dead in her house, he wrote long letters to her son about One pound, three and tuppence that she owed to the grocer, sixteen and nine pence that she owed to the butcher, and so on.

Two years later he is trying to swindle this nephew aforesaid out of some property, and one of the arguments which he uses is, that if he gets this money to which he has no right, he will be able to have a stone put on the grave of his sister. I hope the readers of THE EQUINOX have been ignorant hitherto that there are any people like this Mr. Bishop; that they imagine the peasants in Zola's La Terre to be mostly imaginary: not that Zola's peasants are as disgusting as Mr. Bishop. He is certainly a very strong argument against evolution, though his book is not. After wearing out his sister Ada, finding himself faced with this expense of this stenographer aforesaid, he decided that it would be cheaper to get married. So he went to Llandudno; and, rather like Abraham when he found the ram caught in the thicket by its horns, he found a cow caught in the Children's Special Service Mission by her feet, which were exceptionally large, and took her as wife in name, and secretary and general servant in function. This female, however, developed an unsuspected quality. She made him shave, and Mr. Bishop, who had been going about London for forty years looking like a most venerable old gentleman, was seen to be a monkey. He looked like a monkey so much that the local zoologists used to frequent the neighbourhood of his house on Sunday afternoon. We have also seen that he thinks like a monkey, the god whom he has made in his own image being more ferocious than a gorilla, and far less intelligent. What then are the differences between Mr. Bishop and a monkey? They are not obvious, and I do not think that any man of science will disagree that it is better to leave it to the monkeys to discover them. But if they insist that he is a Nuctanthropus, we must try again, and see if we cannot class him among the cockroaches.

As usual, also, several of them developed as the result of emotional shock, and disappeared under hypnosis and psychological treatment; one by one they were eliminated, until only ìReal Dorisî survived,ówith traces of ìSleeping Margaretî persisting, as a sort of undercurrent of reality. These names, of course, apply to the so-called varied personalities which appeared during their shufflings back and forth; that is, their alternate appearances. It must be admitted at once that Dr. Prince has made some interesting investigations in this curious case, and if we grant the reality of the facts, they have very considerable psychological interest. Of course, it is hard to prove that the whole thing is not a clever fraud. Girls of the kind have a habit of playing such parts, because of the attention they thereby attract; but let us grant their reality, for the sake of the argument. We have, then, an abnormal individual, who needs treatment and cure; and the sooner cured the better! Now, at this point, our friends begin messing-about with ìmediums,î and as the result, obtain an extraordinary amount of rubbish, wholly disconnected from the case, by which they try to prove that the alternating personalities were really ìspiritsî! Most of these messages were obtained through a ìMrs. Chenowethî a medium who has figured largely in the Reports of the American Society, though Heaven only knows why, as she gives us a constant flow of the most terrible drivel which it is possible to conceive. Looking through the so-called Reports on this medium, one is impressed with the idea that it is criminal to waste time, and the Society's money, obtaining such stuff, and criminal to keep pouring money down such a sink of Nothingness. What is the hold which this medium seems to have over the venerable Secretary of the Society? Is it more than a mere scientific interest? Are there subtler motives which cause the Head of the Psychical Movement in America to bow solemnly before the crude ìTeachingsî obtained through this evident fraud of a medium? Any common sense man-of the-world, reading this stuff, would form his own opinions,ófor it is plain to see that,óby merely playing upon his vanity, and flattering him to the skies, this ëmediumí has managed to ingratiate herself so thoroughly with the noted Professor, that he has become blind to evidence, to facts, and to common sense. Here are a few typical ìNuggets of Wisdomî from the sittings: ìThey are not so clear about the life here as they will be when they come but they mean all right.

If this isn't mediumistic cant, I should like to know what is! However, on another occasion, we read: ìGo to hell and there you will find the information you seek my sweet friend.î (p. 622.) Here is some sound advice! This is another little gem, which is dished-up as part of the ìproof of immortalityî: ìMamma gave some advice and now comes to help in the work of proving that the love and care and interest does not cease at death but all is intensified and desires become actions and have effect in friends and loved ones. No one has been able to prove the power of thought and we are not able to prove that we do some things but when we find that the things we think and wish for are taking place then we realize that our thought has had some power even though we did not speak or act. I have no interest whatever that the things said do not match with what I believed in the past. One must tell things as they find them and not as they wish they were.\" O tempora, o mores! Let us admit that ìimmortalityî has now been proved; that Hyslopís Marvellous Medium has furnished the demonstration! We are to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, and there assist the Angels in the compilation of English Grammars (let us hope) for the use of those who communicate through Mrs. Chenoweth! When one reads through stuff like this, one is driven to ask the question How can men of intelligence and learning, perhaps with skill in other lines of research, be driven to accept such nonsense as proof of anything beyond obvious fraud on the part of the ìmediumî? How can their sense of all that constitutes evidence be so lacking,ótheir judgment so at fault,as to accept this drivel as proof of ìspiritsî? One can form only the opinionóone seems driven to this conclusionóthat it is the ìwill to believeî which has influenced them in this mannerónot the evidence itself, but their own warped and faulty judgment. If one analyzes the facts, he finds that practically all those who have advertised their belief in ìImmortalityî are men well along in lifeópractically all past sixty, and some of them many years older. Evidently, they are entering their second childhood. They are so concerned with saving their own souls, with unifying ìScience and Religion,î with showing that they themselves are probably ìImmortal,î that they have lost all sense of humour, of proportion, of evidence, of all these qualities which together constitute the truly scientific scholar. As they are getting along in life, and can no longer enjoy it, they are haunted by the Spectre of Annihilation; and to escape this, they grasp at any straw, accept any evidence, swallow any ìfacts,î given through a twopenny medium, which seem to afford even the slightest ìevidenceî for ìsurvival.î The result is that they all accept such rubbish as that given above (which is"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 289 part of the official record), and seriously claim that it affords them proof of survival-of Immortality! Heigh, Ho! This is a sad world, my children, but never sadder than when we see otherwise good intellects going to the Dogs in this fashion. HODGSON Y. KNOTT. THE VILLAGE. By ERNEST POOLE. The Macmillan Co. THERE is a dreadful wrapper by Boardman Robinson, but he probably needed the money. It is quite the right wrapper too. Ernest Poole has driven the tank of ignorance and vulgarity across the steppes of Russia. Mr. Poole is not very deep, and he is exceptionally stagnant, with a thick green slime of New England prejudice on his surface. Even for a journalist he is appalling. Think of using words like ìdestructedî! It deserves what he calls ìle peine de mort.î His method is to accumulate details, none of which he understands. There is no hint of vision. There is no understanding of Russia. There is nothing but interviews with uninteresting people, whose consciousness does not in any way represent them, or, as we used to say in days of less complicated speech, who do not know what they are talking about. Has he no shame to blot the ëscutcheon of the Pooesóthe other scissors-knights of Savile Row?í The book is interesting enough to any one who knows Russia even slightly, if only because there is a laugh on every page. Some old poet, I forget his name, remarked: ìSome minds improve by travel, others rather Resemble copper wire or brass, Which gets the narrower by going farther.î The days of the innocent God-help-me tourist seem to be done. The tourist of to-day has been bullied by the Y. M. C. A., in intervals between grafts, into moral responsibility and Christian earnestness, and all that sort of thing. A man can hardly go from New York to Philadelphia without writing a serious biography of George Fox. The poop-stick has given place to the prig. I have no hope whatever for the future of humanity. S. O. S. THE CHILDRENíS HOMER. By PADRAIC COLUM. The Macmillan Co. ONE of the points of art is adaptation of the means to the end. If the children of America are nurtured on the worldís greatest story, it will be very nice for everybody in thirty years or so. It seems hopeless to get the present generation to understand that unless they read Greek, they are savages, who, if they are not cannibals, are simply so because they have no skill in cookery."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 290 So Padraic Colum has tried to civilize young America in the right way. No more important task has ever been undertaken, for civilization, education, are fundamental. Reformers usually make the mistake of the empiric, and try to re lieve the symptoms. It is quite useless to try to relieve the symptoms of America. Willy Pogany is not Flaxman, but he is Flaxman enough for children, and now and again, as in the picture facing page 106 (and several others), he is Flaxman enough for nearly everybody. (You cannot expect an illustrator as such to be altogether Flaxman in an age where artists have to earn their living.) But it is impossible to give too much praise to the prose of Padraic Colum. It is simple enough for a child who has just learned to read. It is good enough for a book-worm-eaten hag like myself, sodden on Sterne and Swift. A book like this revives the drooping flower of hope; so long as there are people willing to try, there is still hope for humanity. A. C. HOW TO SING A SONG. By YVETTE GUILBERT. The Macmillan Co. IT is commonplace that Yvette Guilbert is the greatest artist of her period. It is a tragedy that her art happens to be ephemeral. The poignancy of such a realization is like that which one feels in the eternal Greek which Synge re-awakened in the wild Western world. I am thinking of Riders to the Sea. Experience dulls us; words are prostituted in the brothel of life. In Riders to the Sea, Synge says merely, ìA man was drowned.î His genius sweeps away the cobwebs which time spins over the door of the cavern of our imagination. We realize the meaning of those words, ìA man was drowned.î This power to make us feel is the divine thing in art. It is the creative force which answers ìYeaî to the prophet's cynical, \"Lord, shall these dead bones live?\" Now this is exactly what Yvette Guilbert has done for song. She has not done it for one century only. She has made all time speak, give up its secret, to those who are capable to live in that divine air of the spirit which magazines, cocktails, and automobiles so easily pollute. I see in Yvette Guilbert not only an artist in the ordinary sense of the word, but an artist like Blake. Her preface on Time might have come from a Book of Ecclesiastes written by Solomon in the period before that in which he could not do it any more. Vanity of vanities? Contemptuously Yvette Guilbert replies, ìDoes life ever stop?î I am not a singer. The technique of music is to me a mournful mystery. Yet in reading this book I find a thousand splendid counsels valid for all art. This book is more than ìHow to sing a song.î It is a philosophical treatise on How to do anything. The arts are one. There is nothing but creation. As it is written, Love is the law, love under will. It is apprehension of this fact that"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 291 makes artistry of any sort possible. It explains why there are no artists in America, or at least the most we can say is, ìFinger of birth-strangled babe, Ditch-delivered by a drab,î the only decent ingredient in the cauldron of bourgeoisie gone mad. It is impossible to go into details with regard to this book. In every page Yvette Guilbert unconsciously reveals her unique greatness. Her brain is great enough to comprehend the minutiae of technique without in the smallest degree forgetting the fact that technique is absolutely worthless without genius. America is full of technicians, and I suspect that a number of geniuses are born. But the genius is strangled before he can acquire technique, and the technician unfortunately is not strangled at all. But any one who wants to do something worth doing and go to prison, should sleep with this book under his pillow, if he has a pillow. ALEISTER CROWLEY. THE BOY WHO KNEW WHAT THE BIRDS SAID. By PADRAIC COLUM. The Macmillan Co. I THINK the grotesques of Dugald Stewart Walker are extremely charming. They go well with the subtle and tender genius of Padraic Colum. This is only a book for children. But thank God! there are some of us who are children still. This is only a book of fairy tales. But thank God! there are still some fairies. There are still a few people in the world who love beauty, and who are willing to fight for freedom. To read the newspapers, one would suppose that freedom was dead for ever. But with whatever bonds they will bind liberty, there will always be a few like Padraic Colum to keep Her torch alight. We may not be allowed to speak or write what we think, but life will always live in fairyland, and an hour cometh when the doors of fairyland will open, and the iron hero nursed on fairy milk will strike the tyrants dead. ALEISTER CROWLEY. GITANJALI AND FRUIT-GATHERING. By RABINDRANATH TAGORE. The Macmillan Co. KNOWING that whatever is good in Rabindranath Tagore is due to the style of W. B. Yeats, I expected the introduction to be by that individual, who might have been romantic if he had been willing to wash his face and put on a clean collar every month or so. The introduction begins, ìA few days ago I said to a distinguished Bengali doctor of medicine, ëI know no German.íî Apart from the question as to whether Silly Willy counts his fortune in marks or not, I was much distracted by his reference. I found myself back again in Teng-Yueh. We were sitting at dinner in the Consulís house, when the messenger broke in to tell us that the Consulówho was away among some unruly tribesówas ill, perhaps dying. We jumped up, George Forrest, the botanist, and I, and made ready.

It was nine o'clock before we got off. It was a wild, windy night, the moon treacherously gleaming through blown wrack of clouds. I found it impossible to ride my pony, for his hoofs slipped on the wet flags in the darkness. Walking was almost as bad, for my ironshod mountain boots were as slippery as the shoes of the tatu. But we pushed on, gasping, up hill, down dale, all through the night. Dawn broke, chill and grey, on the crest of a great mountain. Far in the distance I saw specks. I left my pony, and ran headlong down the slopes. I had got almost to the bottom of the hill when I saw the Consul's litter. Forrest ran forward. I turned sadly back, for I saw that the Consul's legs were tied. I knew that he was dead. In that country where a thousand plagues hunt down mankind, it was most urgent that a medical man should certify the cause of death. How lucky that we had with us a distin-guished Bengali doctor of medicine! There was only one slight hitch in the programme. The moment that I told him that the Consul was dead, he turned his donkey and bolted for safety. Holy Kali, it might be an infectious disease! There was no point in chasing the creature at the moment. The matter could wait our return. We brought the Consul to his house and Forrest asked me to bring the doctor round. It was necessary to make an official report of the death, and the cause of the death. I went round to the house of the ìdistinguished Bengali doctor of medicine.î He was seated before a pyramid of rice. I attracted his attention by burying a whalebone cutting whip in the rolls of his fat. Between fifty and sixty applications of this instrument secured his presence in the room where we had the corpse. But not even the fear of the whip would induce him to touch it. Rabindranath Tagore is the biggest bluff ever put over the unsuspecting American public. His mysticism makes even Maeterlinck's wishy-washy twaddle seem virile. I have never read such slop. The illustrations match it. The whole production of Young India is babu in the Anglo-Indian sense of the word. The spirit of India is utterly absent. Drawings and writing alike resemble the senseless flourishes of some callow student. And all this while the babu, while accepting what he imagines to be honours, such as knighthood, from England, is plotting sneakishly in the Bengali manner against her. I would to God that the British would withdraw from India for six months, so that the men of India might exterminate these fatherless fish-eaters, this spawn of female dogs that, without caste even in its own slime of bastardy, asserts itself in America as a ëyoung nation.í KWAW LI YA.

Consider the first child, Narada, who is a bastard. Was the father the ëwormí after all? We have nothing for it but the unsupported statement of its mother, the ëwormísí second wife. This may be doubted. Even the colour tells us nothing, for there were plenty of pigmented people in London at the date of the story. When the ëwormísí first wife has divorced him, and he is married to the second wife, one might imagine that complications would be less. Not at all. The first time he leaves her alone, he sets up a harem in India, while she, travelling thither to join him under the charge of his best friend, Dr. Paira Mull, immediately begins an intrigue with this fascinating Panjabi. The ëwormí seems rather to have welcomed this domestic tangle, as Paira Mull is very well off. The second child, Rohini, is the offspring of this liaison. About this time, the ëworm' is getting out a book of Indian folk songs, and he actually tries to include a number of translations made by his wife's lover as his own. However, he is forced by her (after a stormy scene) to make a very inadequate acknowledgment, and we are given to understand that he only does this because the show can be so easily given away, the ëwormí not knowing ten words of the language from which he is supposed to be translating. Isnít this complex enough for anybody? Ah, no! Dr. Coomara-swamy is merely flapping his wings icily. He can stage much stronger dramas. So you see the ëwormí and his wife in New Yorkóof all places! The first thing that strikes him is the High Cost Of Living, and he hastens to offer his wife to the first comer. A friendly agreement is reached in conference by which a divorce shall be obtained, and a new marriage contracted with Alice's new lover. I forget the disposition of the children, whether it was odd man out, or the first Jack, who had to look after the business. But, three months later, the tragedy begins. The 'worm' is struck by the appalling thought that perhaps Alice's new lover may not fall in so simply with the scheme. He manifests reluctance to pay the expenses of the divorce, arguing with some show of good sense that he does not see why he should pay for relieving another man of his rubbish. The situation is complicated by the fact that Alice has again become pregnant. The ëwormí resolves upon a remarkably ingenious solution of his troubles. Past experience has shown him that his wife, when in a ëdelicate condition of health,í cannot stand a sea voyage. Previous to the birth of the second child, she had nearly miscarried and nearly died. ìHow then,î thinks he to himself, ìcan I clear myself once and for all? I will make up to my wife. I will pull out the pathetic stop. I will make mischief between her and her lover. I will forge telegrams, and do anything else that may be necessary. But I will get her to go over to England. That will put an end to the child, and very likely to her too, and then perhaps Paira Mull will take at least one of the childrenóhis ownóoff my hands. Narada, too, is not legally my child at all. He is just a nameless bastard.î So thinks the ëworm,í and so he does. The only detail in which"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 294 his scheme goes wrong is that his wife manages, against all odds, to survive her miscarriage. All this time, the ëwormí himself is living with a German prostitute; and, as he finds this expensive, he tries to keep the wolf from the door by getting this unfortunate woman to copy out various items from the works of his wife's lover, which are not very well known in America, and she proceeds to hawk them about New York. The man whose property they are will not be likely to hear of it, as the inexplicable conduct of Alice has more or less broken his heart, and he has become a sort of hermit. But the wife turns up again like a bad penny. The ëwormí has by this time got rather tired of the German girl, and he goes off to Chicago after another woman, leaving his wife and his mistress to share a room at the McAlpin. Instead of quarreling, they made Friends, and the wholly icily murderous plot is laid bare. Alice now makes strenuous efforts to get back her lover, but he is one of those people who learn by experience. He merely exposes the ëwormísí attempt to pirate his property. It seems to us that Dr. Coomaraswamy leaves the story at what might have been its most interesting complication. It stops right there. The ëwormí gets a job as curator of the Oriental Department of some Art Museum in Boston, and settles down with his wife to live happy ever after. I feel that this may be life, but it is not art. A MOURNER CLAD IN GREEN. FOUR DIMENSIONAL VISTAS. By CLAUDE BRAGDON. Alfred A. Knopf, 1916. IT is a great pleasure to read this book, for although in some points we may find ourselves obliged to disagree with the author, the general effect is that a perusal leaves one with the feeling of having been at home; that is to say, on the planes of pure and exalted thought. We cannot say that Mr. Bragdon is in any sense an original thinker, as Hinton was, but he has done something to extend and popularize Hinton's ideas. Some of the analogies in this book are very illuminating. Unfortunately, as it appears to us, Mr. Bragdon is tied up with theosophical dogmas. He talks about the ënew freedom,í and bases his whole argument on the idea that the material world is a shadow show. Yet he seems to think that the real (that is, the ideal) world is more easy of apprehension, if we bind ourselves hand and foot by the senseless and cruel taboos of the most primitive tribes. He also errs, as it seems to us, in placing the yogi whose attainment is wholly selfish above the man of genius. Blavatsky made no such error. She placed the poet above the adept. In spite of his prave íorts, Mr. Bragdon is not a clear thinker like Hinton. He is just a little bourgeois who has put on Hintonís hat, and it comes down very far indeed over his eyes. He cannot see that the interpretation of phenomena as spiritual does not destroy their reality and the truth of their"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 295 mutual relation, but rather confirms it. Shallow thinkers always seem to be obsessed by the stupidity that if anything is a shadow, dream, illusion, it ceases to exist. The rules of dreams are just as rigid as the rules of mathematics. You cannot do anything you like with a surd merely because it is an ëimpossibleí or ëimaginaryí quantity. It is such booby traps that catch such asses in lion's skins as Mr. Bragdon. O. M. OGILVIEíS ASTROLOGICAL BIRTHDAY BOOK. By LEO BERNART. J. S. Ogilvie Publishing Co. IN the preface Mr. Bernart correctly states that the exact date and hour of birth are necessary to delineate a horoscope. Yet he publishes a book which attempts such a delineation on the birthday alone. Now, the birthday tells the astrologer nothing but the position of the sun in the zodiac at the time of birth, and this position varies to a small but sufficient extent in different years. This is indeed divining Hercules not merely from his foot, but from a big toe which may not be his at all. The error is often amusingly illustrated in the book itself. For example, Wm. T. Stead and Admiral Farragut were both born on July 5th. On July 11th, John Quincy Adams and Wanamaker. This happy combination is told, \"You are a good mimic and have a Singing voice. You are not as fond of literary and Scientific pursuits as you should be. You prefer the lighter side of life, which is all very well in its way, but the serious Side must have its innings also.\" On July 23rd, Mr. Bernart tells Cardinal Gibbons that he is religious but not orthodox. It is also new to me that the Cardinal `likes candy to an unusual degree.' A great many of these delineations are evidently taken straight from the people who are mentioned as being born. For example, October 22nd, ìYou are emotional and dramatic and would make a success upon the stage in all probability,î which is Sarah Bernhardt. And on Nansen's birthday, ìYou have romantic ideas in youth which probably express themselves in seeking for lost or buried treasures or in exploring underground passages or little known caves.î On Edward VII.ís, ìYou have a brilliant career before you.î ìYou are fond of the world.î ìYou have a great deal of tact and diplomacy.î ìYou are fond of the good things of this life.î ìYou are fleeting in your affections, and will have a good many love affairs in your life.î However, ìyou are eminently domesticated.î Sometimes it is rather funny.

She asked me if I would help him by publishing poems of his, and I wrote to him. He replied by complaining that the young lady aforesaid had tried to seduce him. This appeared an uncomplimentary reference to Augustus John, Walter Duranty, myself, and several others.

They are messy, and rather conventional. But I like some of the parables very much indeed. It is not very sensible to compare Mr. Gibran with Blake, because Blake was a genius whose every act was wrought from the white heat of passion. This is a smaller fish swimming in shallower and calmer waters. The spirit is more French than Irish. However, he is short enough to speak for himself. Here is one of his parables THE SCARECROW Once I said to a scarecrow, ìYou must be tired of standing in this lonely field.î And he said, ìThe joy of scaring is a deep and lasting one, and I never tire of it.î Said I, after a minute of thought, ìIt is true; for I too have known that joy.î Said he, ìOnly those who are stuffed with straw can know it.î Then I left him, not knowing whether he had complimented or belittled it.

Alfred A. Knopf. MR. ARCHER has been through India, I should judge for as much as six weeks, with a typewriter and a provincial third-rate mind. Edmund Burke said ìThis multitude of men does not consist of an abject and barbarous population. . . . (They are) a people for ages civilized and cultivated; cultivated by all the arts of polished life while we were yet in the woods.î This obvious fact is not obvious to Mr. Archer. Like the clever journalist he is, he has documented himself with so many facts that he does not tell us that Indians are negroes, who throw their children to crocodiles, but on every page one can feel that he cherishes this view in his pate. His method of investigating India is the method of Count Smorltork; but Count Smorltork was a gentleman. His point of view is so ignorant and so bourgeois, that I am forced to quote passages, lest it should not be believed that any biped could print such rottenness. ìThis senseless reduplication to infinity of one mincing, prancing figure produces an indescribably nightmare-like effect; and what can be said for it, from the point of view either of art or of religion, I, for my part, cannot conceive. Who the figures represent I am not sure; . . .î ìYes, the horroróthat is the only word for it. I do not mean that nowadays any particular horrors are perpetrated in the grim recesses of these giant fanes. I do not know that at any time they were the scenes of great cruelty or other abominations, though certainly they present the completest mise-en-scene for such excesses. What I do know is that, from the corner-stone to the coping of the highest gopura, they are the product of gloomy, perverted, morbidly overwrought imaginations, revelling in the most extravagant features of the most monstrous of all mythologies.î This is all that Mr. Archer gets from the greatest temple, both from an artistic and religious standpoint, that is alive to-day. And in order that he may write himself down an ass for all to see, he is stupid enough to publish photographs of temples, whose beauty would, one thinks, be evident even to the bovine readers to whom he doubtless appeals."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 298 Mr. Archer's arrogance is equal to his ignorance. ìAnd on every hand, in its swarming courts and alcoves, you see the lowest fetichism intent in its grovelling rites.î How does this animal know what the people were doing?

He utterly ignores the fact that it is the caste system which has preserved Indian civilization. Constantly conquered, India absorbs her conquerors. When the fool gets on to the spirituality, he is funnier than ever. On page 59, he gives a curiously imperfect account of the names of Hindu sacred writings, and apologizes for himself in the following note: ìI trust there is no gross error in this paragraph; but very confusing explanations are given of the nomenclature of this literature.î He then proceeds to criticise the contents of those books! It is incredible that any one can be such an ass as to write the stuff that one finds in this book. Page after page of misstatement and misunderstanding. He is even unable to see a thing like the good manners of the natives. In all the time I was in India I do not recall a single instance of bad manners, except on the part of Babus who had learned them from low-class Europeans, like William Archer.

In a few seated female figures, viewed from behind, there is a certain natural grace, but most of the women who swarm all over the reliefs are the product of a morbid convention which gives them enormous breasts, wasp waists, and atrophied legs, and places them in attitudes suggestive of a violent dislocation of the hipjoint.

And yet: ìIn the Indian epics, the poets are always trying to outdo themselves and each other in their search for the marvellous, whether in virtue, prowess, gorgeousness, wickedness, demoniacal fury, or mere numerical extravagance.

What wonder that a people habituated from childhood to these orgies of unbridled fancy should suffer from a certain slackening of imaginative fibre, an insensitiveness to normal and wholesome stimulation? It is that insensitiveness which seems to me to account for all that is worst in Indian art. It is that insensitiveness which will have to be corrected before India can hope to make the best of her intellectual gifts in a world in which, though all may be illusory, the God-made illusion of Nature must in the end prevail over the man-made illusions of mythology and metaphysics.î I am perfectly in accord with the political conclusion of this book.

I always thought him crazy with his ideas on fasting and his weighing souls, but he always gave the impression of the greatest sincerity. He did extraordinarily good work in the case of Eusapia Palladino. He merely destroys one's confidence when he coils himself in the Flag, and issues a Bryce Report like the mysteries of Myra, lends his name to quacks like Michael Whitty (not Witty), who doesn't even deny that he is the American representative of the swindler and blackmailer Mathers, so often exposed in the columns of THE EQUINOX, and helps to edit the review of an obviously fraudulent sealed letter reader like Christiansen.

I HAVE so deep a debt of gratitude in my personal ledger to Mrs. Emily Grant Hutchings, that I can but be prejudiced most favorably with regard to anything with which she may be connected. I consequently take especial pains to discount the obligation, and I may be relied upon to say the worst of Patience Worth. It is, I think, beyond all question the most interesting of the records purporting to be the utterance of the stiff. There is an unquestionable personality in Patience Worth with perhaps no one beyond the scope of ìsubliminal Mrs. Curranî and the hypothesis is reasonable since Mrs. Curran is always at the board when Patience manifests. To me it seems a much simpler hypothesis to suppose that Patience is Mrs. Curranís sub-conscious memory of an Elizabethan incarnation than that Patience is wandering, unchanged for several centuries, about the astral plane, where things are so easily broken up. It is also quite feasible to imagine Patience as an elemental spirit. But undoubtedly her utterance is remarkably distinctive and coherent. It is almost entirely free from the worst of the disfigurements to which psychical researchers have acclimatized us, confound them. The mention of psychical researchers has ruined my temper again. I am going to be nasty even to my dear Mrs. Hutchings. It is very easy to spoil a case by claiming too much. Jesus preferred would stand higher in the market to-day if some would-be clever press agent had not added ridiculous Pagan stories of the Virgin Birth, and so on, to the earlier and more plausible legend. And the most serious criticism of Patience Worth is the existence of that ridiculous novel by ìMark Twain.î Patience Worth is not impossible, or even improbable. She makes mistakes. She commits anachronisms. But any difficulties are fairly easy to explain away. When it comes to Mark Twain, the"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 301 case is altogether different.

THE atmosphere of this book is so seductive that one reads it under the impression that it will start sooner or later; but it doesn't. SUMATRA RAPPER. PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA AND THE WAR. By HEREWARD CARRINGTON. Dodd, Mead & Co., Inc. THIS book is an extremely interesting and valuable contribution to the science of the future. The first part of it, which relates to normal psychology, is extremely well compiled, and offers a capital picture of the peculiar phenomena which accompany combat under modern conditions. It is a serious study of actuality, entirely free from the pathological point of view of people like Barbusse on one hand, or the average newspaper correspondent on the other. The second and larger part of the book deals with various supernormal events connected with war. I suppose Mr. Carringtonís trouble is the paucity of his material. He feels that he has to fill his book, and he certainly uses a great deal of appalling rubbish. He even reaches lice of the slime like Harold Begbie. It is very unfortunate that Mr. Carrington with his fine critical ability, his great experience in distinguishing between false and true, should have laid aside his weapons in his old age. It is to such persons as he is that we look for discrimination, yet in this book the most excellently authenticated narratives are cheek by jowl with ëthinking horsesí, and the humbug of sweet Phyllis Campbell. Mr. Carrington is very careless too. He tells the story of Col. óís appearance to his old regiment at great length twice over.

He has apparently gone over almost wholly to the Spiritists, and he has allowed himself at times to take a very crude flag-waving attitude about National psychologies. I should like to point out that every case of supernormal phenomenon is explained fully if we accept the Rosicrucian teaching with regard to elementals. There is no space for detailed exposition of these points, but those familiar with the theory will find no difficulty at all in applying it to any particular case. This book is decidedly superior to True Ghost Stories; it is intended for readers of a somewhat higher type of intelligence. But Mr. Carrington's way is not the way of those who become great. Herbert Spencer was contented to plug on year after year writing for readers barely mustering five score.

J. C. A CHASTE MAN. By LOUIS UMFRAVILLE WILKINSON. Alfred A. Knopf. IT has often been disputed as to how far a novelist is right in showing us the seamy side of life. But the answer admits of no dispute. Truth is the most precious jewel of all. The atmosphere of Mr. Wilkinson's new book, despite the brightness and insouciance of the manner and the lightness of the incident, is one of the most tragic gloom. The scene opens upon the hero reminding somebody that this is the third application, etc., and unless, etc., yours faithfully, and the novel ends with his reminding somebody, probably the same person, of the same thing. Such an appalling realization of the horror of life makes one shudder and sicken. Between the two applications comes an adventure. The hero, who is a married man, meets a charming girl of sixteen, falls in love with heróand she with him. Every conceivable circumstance conspires to bring about immoral relations, so-called, between them. The girlís father himself urges it. But the hero remains chaste. The tragedy thus brought about is absolutely nauseating. It is hard for the reviewer to think of the grim and grisly abomination which follows. The hero has to go away to Switzerland, for a month or two; and during his absence the girl marries a Canadian and goes to Canada with him. The gloom is not even lightened by any hint that she may have had some adventure previous to the marriage. No hope is held out that she may have any adventure after that. The Abomination of Desolation is set up in the holy place. But there is reserved for us a yet more terrible contemplation. If one had said, ìThe girl escapes from the intrigue with her married lover, and is"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 303 honorably married to a Canadian,î every one would say, ìWhat a wholesome story!î The poison of puritanism has rotted through the whole of human thought. Conventional morality is the syphilis of the soul, and it is for the God Mercury, no one less, to oppose its action. Our trouble is rendered a thousand times more grievous because most of us do not recognize how foul is our disease. The words ëmarriage with a Canadianí should be expunged from human language. People should be prosecuted for printing so foul and obscene a phrase. Yet these things happen every day. The sun turns sick in heaven to behold them. Yet we do not see his anguish. Life which involves such possibilities of infamy and horror as ëmarriage with a Canadianí must surely be some atrocious species of damnation; the reward of infinite iniquity. But humanity has become so callous, so anaesthetic to any proper feeling, that many people may even fail to see the high seriousness and noble purpose of such statements as the above. The degradation of humanity has gone so far that marriage with a Canadian seems almost normal and natural. There is no mistaking the great advance made by Mr. Wilkinson upon his previous novel, The Buffoon. In that work, there was, indeed, power and wit. But it was on the whole a pleasant book. There was plenty of comic reliefóe.g., Powys' duodenum. In A Chaste Man the author moves stately and terrible from peak to peak of tragedy. The book reminds us a little of James Thomson, The City of Dreadful Night, in this respect. With infinite art the climax is set off by an adventure of the hero's sister with a man dying of consumption at St. Moritz, and this single glimpse of Paradise makes the surrounding gloom more visible and shameful. It is unfortunately the case that stories of this kind are only too true to life. Few of us, indeed, but have some experience of the classes in which such abominations are not only possible but actual. It is true that the war has done a great deal to destroy the morality of the middle classes. From all hands comes the wail of the Puritan as he is forced into a recognition that life is a savage and beautiful thing, and that his attempt to make every one behave with the decorum of a putrefying corpse is bound in the long run to fail. We find, for example, the Bishop of Worcester offering a tasteless substitute for Worcester Sauce. He complains pitifully of how he saw three women in the street trying to seduce a soldier. Apparently in consequence of the appearance of the Bishop, the soldier \"saw his chance and ran away,\" but from what we know of Bishops it seems probable that he was trying to escape from the Episcopal rather than the feminine menace. We hope that in Mr. Wilkinson's next novel he will try to give us the brighter side of the picture. The eternal death which the bourgeoisie calls life is not the only feature of experience.

JOHN. ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE UNSEEN. An Examination of the Phenomena of Spiritualism and of the Evidence for Survival after Death. By SIR WILLIAM F. BARRETT. E. P. Dutton & Co. SIR WILLIAM BARRETTís book is decidedly well worth reading by those who imagine that there is nothing in spiritualism and kindred subjects. Sir William Barrett has marshalled his facts and fictions in a very creditable manner. It is quite surprising how much he knows, and how clever he is, considering the limitations imposed on him by the fact that, like most psychical researchers, he has no sort of initiation, and has therefore no organized but only haphazard material at his disposal. He exhibits quite remarkable intelligence in dealing with the problems which he discusses. It is a very marked advance upon the absolutely blithering balderdash which characterizes most writing on spiritualism, `new thought,' and the like. Sir William Barrett is critical, without being skeptical in the bad sense of the word, and his judgment is excellent for an amateur. Of course, all psychical research without initiation reminds one of art criticism by a blind man or an art critic. Apart from this, however, Sir William Barrett has written a very clever book, and I hope that these few well chosen words of approval may encourage him to further efforts, perhaps not so much in this line as in one for which he might have more original talent. A. C. FROM THE WATCH TOWER. By SIDNEY T. KLEIN. E. P. Dutton & Co. WHEN I had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Sidney T. Klein's Science and the Infinite in Number IX. of the First Volume of THE EQUINOX, I remember asking him for a second part to his book dealing with the means of attainment. Mr. Klein has not exactly done this in his new volume, but he has gone a long way on the road. He is still somewhat handicapped by infelicity of expression, but a more serious drawback still is the confusion of thought caused by his early training. He is a sublime initiate, but he is trying to put his quart of Champagne into the pint pot of the language of Christian Mysticism. He has not seen the necessity of discarding this deuce and trey. He stands pat on his three aces instead of trying to catch the fourth or maybe a pair of kings in the draw. The language of Christianity, particularly Pauline Christianity, is hopelessly mired in the slough of the idea of original sin."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"REVIEWS 305 Mr. Klein disavows this idea with noble boldness as freely as we ourselves of the A∴A∴ would do. He has accepted the Law of Thelema. He understands that there is no law beyond ìDo what thou wilt.î He states it almost in so many words. And yet his congenital fetter seems to gall. He has not quite got the idea that every man and every woman is a star, and that every one's will is the will of God; at least, he does not seem settled about it. In some parts of his book he makes statements which certainly imply that this is so, but in others he appears too conscious of dividuality. He does not always make it perfectly clear that evil so-called is part of the game, which he describes as the ëthought of God.í We have no doubt that as he progresses, he will attain this clearer conception of the magical doctrine. He has already gone very far. His interpretation, for example, of the statement ìGod is Loveî can hardly be distinguished from our own ìLove is the law.î Yet even here there is some taint of a lingering Manichaeanism. He seems to imagine ìthe All-Lovingî as always trying to bring us to a conception of sonship. Yet this ëAll-Lovingí is a metaphysical entity, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and so on. The result is that now and again Mr. Klein's expression slips back into the language of dualism. However, it is a shame to carp. Mr. Klein's philosophical and scientific knowledge is profound. It is unified. Better still, it is dynamic and exulting. It is impossible to read a page of his book without feeling the contagion of the joy of his attainment. Too many philosophers in the past have drooled on about the Absolute with such piety of dullness, that one has wished the Absolute at the devil. There is nothing of this in this book. We feel that Mr. Klein is enjoying the Light, Life, Love and Liberty which come from the acceptance of the Law of Thelema. But I must still ask him for another volume. The greater part of his difficulty in explanation seems to arise from the fact that he has no conception of a technique of attainment. He says quite rightly that it is all a matter of thinking right instead of wrong, and certainly a study of his pages should do a great deal to clear up intellectual difficulties. But this is only a very small part of the Path. It is all very well to say that reason is full of falsity, and Mr. Klein demonstrates it very much as I have myself done in many places. But how are people to use the eyes of the spirit, unless they are taught? The A∴A∴ offers a technique of attainment infinitely subtle and varied, so that the need of every man is met by processes of actual practice, scientifically tested and confirmed. It is not enough merely to accept Mr. Klein's explanation of the universe. That is the Giant's Robe. You must get your own clothes made to fit you. You cannot persuade yourself to think in any way contrary to your experience. Thought must be the expression of experience.

In 1901 I said of Ibsen, ìhe is the Sophocles of manners.î And elsewhere spoke of him as ìa purely Greek dramatist.î Mr. Mencken says, ìthe fabulous Ibsen of the symbols (no more the real Ibsen than Christ was a prohibitionist).î ìHis shining skill as a dramatic craftsman his one authentic claim upon fame.î Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.

SANINE is not a supreme novel in the full flower of a period, like La Cousine Bette. It is too lyric. It is like the timid song of a young thrush in the morning of life. For this novel is much more than a great novel. It is the first novel of an epoch. It is the first attempt to depict a man who is living by the Law of Thelema, whose outlook on the world is based upon the magical formulae of the ∆on of Horus: ìEvery man and every woman is a starî; ìThere is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.î Sanine absolutely refuses to be obfuscated by the fog of false morality. He judges actions by their real, not by their imaginary consequences. Bernard Shaw attempted this very feebly in his portrait of John Tanner; but Tanner, like Shaw himself, is a blustering and wordy weakling, who is entirely the slave of the morality which he condemns. Sanine actually lives up to the truth which he sees, and it makes him free, and it makes free those who follow him. This is a great book to shed light upon the greybeard slobbering of Shaw. Violetís baby is only tolerable because Violet is Mrs. Malone. Shaw has not the strength of character to avow (even in a fictitious work) that a woman can assert what is evidently her first right without undergoing phantastic penalties, although there are to-day thousands of women in every country who have told morality to go to its father, the devil, as Shaw so bombastically tells it to do. The phantoms which confront the free man are really just hollow turnips in churchyards. Take poor Ambrose, for example. He occupies one of the most important positions in New York City. He lives his own life for 15 years or so. Nobody is offended. Nobody is injured. Nothing whatever happens. A pleasant time is had by all. Then, suddenly some one discovers this appalling state of circumstances, and there is Ambrose in peril of Sing-Sing and Matteawan, and all those pretty places on the Hudson. He loses his job. He is an outcast from society. He vanishes like morning mist. And there is not a single shadow of reason for all this, except an ecclesiastical nefas, based principally upon a comic Turkish superstition. The stupidity of governments is unthinkable. People reclaim a little obvious freedom, and the authorities will not let them have it without all this cutting of throats, and robbing of churches! The Gods seem to send imbeciles like Louis XVI. and Nicholas Romanoff, and certain other persons whom I will not mention, at the moment when free men decide that it is time to strike for freedom.

IT IS NOT VERY DIFFICULT to write a book, if one chance to possess the necessary degree of Initiation, and the power of expression. It is infernally difficult to comment on such a Book. The principal reason for this is that every statement is true and untrue, alternately, as one advances upon the Path of the Wise. The question always arises: For what grade is this Book meant? To give one simple concrete example, it is stated in the third part of this treatise that Change is the great enemy. This is all very well as meaning that one ought to stick to oneís job. But in another sense Change is the Great Friend. As it is marvelous well shewed forth by The Beast Himself in Liber Aleph, Love is the law, and Love is Change, by definition. Short of writing a separate interpretation suited for every grade, therefore, the commentator is in a bog of quandary which makes Flanders Mud seem like polished granite. He can only do his poor best, leaving it very much to the intelligence of each reader to get just what he needs.

He is always getting rid of Illusions, but, like the entourage of the Cardinal Lord Archbishop of Rheims after he cursed the thief, nobody seems one penny the worseóor the better. Probably the best way to take the whole treatise is to assume that it is written for the absolute tyro, with a good deal between the lines for the more advanced mystic. This will excuse, to the mahatma-snob, a good deal of apparent triviality and crudity of standpoint. It is of course necessary for the commentator to point out just those things which the novice is not expected to see. He will have to shew mysteries in many grades, and each reader must glean his own wheat. At the same time, the commentator has done a good deal to uproot some of the tares in the mind of the tyro aforesaid, which Madame Blavatsky was apparently content to let grow until the day of judgment. But that day is come since she wrote this Book; the New ∆on is here, and its Word is Do what thou wilt.

It is important to reject any Iddhi of which you may become possessed. Firstly, because of the wasting of energy, which should rather be concentrated on further advance; and secondly, because Iddhi are in many cases so seductive that they lead the unwary to forget altogether the real purpose of their endeavours. The Student must be prepared for temptations of the most extraordinary subtlety; as the Scriptures of the Christians mystically put it, in their queer but often illuminating jargon, the Devil can disguise himself as an Angel of Light.

True, you are supposed to be ignorant of the dangers of the lower Iddhi; but there are really quite a lot of people, even in Boston, who do not know that there are any Iddhi at all, low or high. However, one who has been assiduous with Book 4, by Frater Perdurabo, should have no difficulty so far as a general comprehension of the subject-matter of the Book is concerned. Too ruddy a cheerfulness on the part of the assiduous one will however be premature, to say the least. For the fact is that this treatise does not contain an intelligible and coherent cosmogony. The unfortunate Lanoo is in the position of a sea-captain who is furnished with the most elaborate and detailed sailing-instructions, but is not allowed to have the slightest idea of what port he is to make, still less given a chart of the Ocean. One finds oneself accordingly in a sort of ìChilde Roland to the Dark Tower cameî atmosphere. That poem of Browning owes much of its haunting charm to this very circumstance, that the reader is never told who Childe Roland is, or why he wants to get to the Dark Tower, or what he expects to find when he does get there. There is a skilfully constructed atmosphere of Giants, and Ogres, and Hunchbacks, and the rest of the apparatus of fairy-tales; but there is no trace of the influence of BÊdeker in the style. Now this is really very irritating to anybody who happens to be seriously concerned to get to that tower. I remember, as a boy, what misery I suffered over this poem. Had Browning been alive, I think I would have sought him out, so seriously did I take the Quest. The student of Blavatsky is equally handicapped.

The voice of Nada is very soon heard by the beginner, especially during the practice of Pranayama (control of breath-force). At first it resembles distant surf, though in the adept it is more like the twittering of innumerable night-ingales; but this sound is premonitory, as it were, the veil of more distinct and articulate sounds which come later.

Foró This is a corollary of Verse 4. These texts may be interpreted in a quite elementary sense. It is of course the object of even the beginner to suppress mind and all its manifestations, but only as he advances will he discover what Mind means. 6. When to himself his form appears unreal, as do on waking all the forms he sees in dreams; This is a somewhat elementary result. Concentration on any subject leads soon enough to a sudden and overwhelming conviction that the object is unreal. The reason of this may perhaps beóspeaking philosophicallyóthat the object, whatever it is, has only a relative existence. (See The Equinox, vol. I, no. 4, p. 159)."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"THE VOICE OF THE SILENCE 9 7. When he has ceased to hear the many, he may discern the ONEóthe inner sound which kills the outer. By the ìmanyî are meant primarily noises which take place outside the Student, and secondly, those which take place inside him. For example, the pulsation of the blood in the ears, and later the mystic sounds which are described in Verse 40. 8. Then only, not till then, shall he forsake the region of ASAT, the false, to come unto the realm of SAT, the true. By ìSAT, the true,î is meant a thing previous to the ìREALî referred to above. SAT itself is an illusion. Some schools of philosophy have a higher ASAT, Not-Being, which is beyond SAT, and consequently is to Shivadarshana as SAT is to Atmadarshana. Nirvana is beyond both these. 9. Before the soul can see, the Harmony within must be attained, and fleshly eyes be rendered blind to all illusion. By the ìHarmony withinî is meant that state in which neither objects of sense, nor physiological sensations, nor emotions, can disturb the concentration of thought. 10. Before the Soul can hear, the image (man) has to become as deaf to roarings as to whispers, to cries of bellowing elephants as to the silvery buzzing of the golden fire-fly. In the text the image is explained as ìMan,î but it more properly refers to the consciousness of man, which consciousness is considered as being a reflection of the Non-Ego, or a creation of the Ego, according to the school of philosophy to which the Student may belong. 11. Before the soul can comprehend and may remember, she must unto the Silent Speaker be united just as the form to which the clay is modeled, is first united with the potterís mind."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 Any actual object of the senses is considered as a precipitation of an ideal. Just as no existing triangle is a pure triangle, since it must be either equilateral, isosceles, or scalene, so every object is a miscarriage of an ideal. In the course of practice one concentrates upon a given thing, rejecting this outer appearance and arriving at that ideal, which of course will not in any way resemble any of the objects which are its incarnations. It is with this in view that the verse tells us that the Soul must be united to the Silent Speaker. The words ìSilent Speakerî may be considered as a hieroglyph of the same character as Logos, ynda or the Ineffable Name. 12. For then the soul will hear and will remember. The word ìhearî alludes to the tradition that hearing is the organ of Spirit, just as seeing is that of Fire. The word ìrememberî might be explained as ìwill attain to memory.î Memory is the link between the atoms of consciousness, for each successive consciousness of Man is a single phenomenon, and has no connection with any other. A looking-glass knows nothing of the different people that look into it. It only reflects one at a time. The brain is however more like a sensitive plate, and memory is the faculty of bringing up into consciousness any picture required. As this occurs in the normal man with his own experiences, so it occurs in the Adept with all experiences. (This is one more reason for His identifying Himself with others.) 13.

If thy soul smiles while bathing in the Sunlight of thy Life; if thy soul sings within her chrysalis of flesh and matter; if thy soul weeps inside her castle of illusion; if thy soul struggles to break the silver thread that binds her to the MASTER; know, O Disciple, thy Soul is of the earth. In this verse the Student is exhorted to indifference to everything but his own progress. It does not mean the indifference of the Man to the things around him, as it has often been so unworthily and wickedly interpreted. The indifference spoken of is a kind of inner indifference. Everything should be enjoyed to the full, but always with the reservation that the absence of the thing enjoyed shall not cause regret. This is too hard for the beginner, and in many cases it is necessary for him to abandon pleasures in order to prove to himself that he is indifferent to them, and it may be occasionally advisable even for the Adept to do this now and again. Of course during periods of actual concentration there is no time whatever for anything but the work itself; but to make even the mildest asceticism a rule of life is the gravest of errors, except perhaps that of regarding Asceticism as a virtue. This latter always leads to spiritual pride, and spiritual pride is the principal quality of the brother of the Left-hand Path. ìAsceticî comes from the Greek 'A s k e w ìto work curiously, to adorn, to exercise, to train.î The Latin ars is derived from this same word. Artist, in its finest sense of creative craftsman, is therefore the best translation. The word has degenerated under Puritan foulness. 15.

This verse deals with an obstacle at a more advanced stage. It is again a warning not to shut oneís self up in oneís own universe. It is not by the exclusion of the Non-Ego that saintship is attained, but by its inclusion. Love is the law, love under will. 16. When waxing stronger, thy Soul glides forth from her secure retreat; and breaking bose from the protecting shrine, extends her silver thread and rushes onward; when beholding her image on the waves of Space she whispers, ìThis is I,î ódeclare, O Disciple, that thy Soul is caught in the webs of delusion. An even more advanced instruction, but still connected with the question of the Ego and the non-Ego. The phenomenon described is perhaps Atmadarshana, which is still a delusion, in one sense still a delusion of personality; for although the Ego is destroyed in the Universe, and the Universe in it, there is a distinct though exceedingly subtle tendency to sum up its experience as Ego. These three verses might be interpreted also as quite elementary; v. 14 as blindness to the First Noble Truth ìEverything is Sorrowî; v. 15 as the cowardís attempt to escape Sorrow by Retreat; and v. 16 as the acceptance of the Astral as SAT. 17.

Saith the Great Law:óìIn order to become the KNOWER of ALL-SELF, thou hast first of SELF to be the knower.î To reach the knowledge of that SELF, thou hast to give up Self to Non-Self, Being to Non-Being, and then thou canst repose between the wings of the GREAT BIRD. Aye, sweet is rest between the wings of that which is not born, nor dies, but is the AUM throughout eternal ages. The words ìgive upî may be explained as ìyieldî in its subtler or quasi-masochistic erotic sense, but on a higher plane. In the following quotation from the ìGreat Lawî it explains that the yielding is not the beginning but the end of the Path. Then let the End awake. Long hast thou slept, O great God Terminus! Long ages hast thou waited at the end of the city and the roads thereof. Awake Thou! wait no more! Nay, Lord! but I am come to Thee. It is I that wait at last.

And the swan was ever silent. Ah! but we floated in the infinite Abyss. Joy! Joy! White swan, bear thou ever me up between thy wings! 21. Give up thy life, if thou wouldíst live. This verse may be compared with similar statements in the Gospels, in The Vision and the Voice, and in the Books of It does not mean asceticism in the sense usually understood by the world. The 12th ∆thyr (see The Equinox, vol. I, no. 5, Supplement) gives the clearest explanation of this phrase. 22. Three Halls, O weary pilgrim, lead to the end of toils. Three Halls, O conqueror of Mara, will bring thee through three states into the fourth and thence into the seven worlds, the worlds of Rest Eternal. If this had been a genuine document I should have taken the three states to be Srotapatti, etc., and the fourth Arhat, for which the reader should consult Science and Buddhism and similar treatises. But as it is better than ìgenuine,î being, like The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz, the forgery of a great adept, one cannot too confidently refer it thus. For the ìSeven Worldsî are not Buddhism. 23. If thou wouldíst learn their names, then hearken, and remember. The name of the first Hall is IGNORANCE óAvidy‚. It is the Hall in which thou sawíst the light, in which thou livest and shalt die. These three Halls correspond to the Gunas: Ignorance, Tamas; Learning, Rajas; Wisdom, Sattvas."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 16 Again, ignorance corresponds to Malkuth and Nephesch (the animal soul), Learning to Tiphareth and Ruach (the mind), and Wisdom to Binah and Neschamah (the aspiration or Divine Mind). 24. The name of Hall the second is the Hall of LEARNING. in it thy Soul will find the blossoms of life, but under every flower a serpent coiled. This Hall is a very much larger region than that usually understood by the Astral World. It would certainly include alI states up to Dhyana. The Student will remember that his ìrewardsî immediately transmute themselves into temptations. 25. The name of the third Hall is Wisdom, beyond which stretch the shoreless waters of AKSHARA, the indestructible Fount of Omniscience. Akshara is the same as the Great Sea of the Qabalah. The reader must consult The Equinox for a full study of this Great Sea. 26. If thou wouldíst cross the first Hall safely, let not thy mind mistake the fires of lust that burn therein for the Sunlight of life. The metaphor is now somewhat changed. The Hall of ignorance represents the physical life. Note carefully the phraseology, ìlet not thy mind mistake the fires of lust.î It is legitimate to warm yourself by those fires so long as they do not deceive you. 27. If thou wouldíst cross the second safely, stop not the fragrance of its stupefying blossoms to inhale. if freed thou wouldíst be from the Karmic chains, seek not for thy Guru in those M‚y‚vic regions.

The wise ones tarry not. That is to say, they do not allow pleasure to interfere with business. 29. The WISE ONES heed not the sweet-tongued voices of illusion. The wise ones heed not. They listen to them, but do not necessarily attach importance to what they say. 30. Seek for him who is to give thee birth, in the Hall of Wisdom, the Hall which lies beyond, wherein all shadows are unknown, and where the light of truth shines with unfading glory. This apparently means that the only reliable guru is one who has attained the grade of Magister Templi. For the attainments of this grade consult The Equinox, vol. I, no. 5, Supplement, etc. 31. That which is uncreate abides in thee, Disciple, as it abides in that Hall. If thou wouldíst reach it and blend the two, thou must divest thyself of thy dark garments of illusion. Stifle the voice of flesh, albow no image of the senses to get between its light and thine that thus the twain may blend in one. And having learnt thine own Agny‚na, flee from the Hall of Learning.

This is a rÈsumÈ of the previous seven verses. It inculcates the necessity of unwavering aspiration, and in particular warns the advanced Student against accepting his rewards.

This light shines from the jewel of the Great Ensnarer, (M‚ra). The senses it bewitches, blinds the mind, and leaves the unwary an abandoned wreck. I am inclined to believe that most of Blavatskyís notes are intended as blinds. ìLightî such as is described has a technical meaning. It would be too petty to regard Mara as a Christian would regard a man who offered him a cigarette. The supreme and blinding light of this jewel is the great vision of Light. It is the light which streams from the threshold of Nirvana, and M‚ra is the ìdweller on the threshold.î It is absurd to call this light ìevilî in any commonplace sense. It is the two-edged sword, flaming every way, that keeps the gate of the Tree of Life. And there is a further Arcanum connected with this which it would be improper here to divulge. 33. The moth attracted to the dazzling flame of thy nightlamp is doomed to perish in the viscid oil. The unwary Soul that fails to grapple with the mocking demon of illusion, will return to earth the slave of M‚ra. The result of failing to reject rewards is the return to earth. The temptation is to regard oneself as having attained, and so do no more work. 34. Behold the Hosts of Souls. Watch how they hover oíer the stormy sea of human life, and how exhausted, bleeding, broken-winged, they drop one after other on the swelling waves.

Let not thy ìHeaven-born,î merged in the sea of m‰y„, break from the Universal Parent (SOUL), but let the fiery power retire into the inmost chamber, the chamber of the Heart, and the abode of the Worldís Mother.

Then from the heart that Power shall rise into the sixth, the middle region, the place between thin eyes, when it becomes the breath of the ONE-SOUL, the voice which filleth all, thy Masterís voice.

(This might happen as the result of his having conquered, and uprooted them, and ìfried their seedsî in a previous birth.) 40.

It changes next into a trumpet-blast. The last vibrates like the dull rumbling of a thundercloud. The seventh swallows all the other sounds. They die, and then are heard no more. The first four are comparatively easy to obtain, and many people can hear them at will. The last three are much rarer, not necessarily because they are more difficult to get, and indicate greater advance, but because the protective envelope of the Adept is become so strong that they cannot pierce it.

It is a mingling of terror and rapture impossible to describe, and as a general rule it completely discharges the energy of the Adept, leaving him weaker than an attack of Malaria would do; but if the practice has been right, this soon passes off, and the experience has this advantage, that one is far less troubled with minor phenomena than before. It is just possible that this is referred to in the Apocalypse XVI, XVII, XVIII. 41. When the six are slain and at the Masterís feet are laid, then is the pupil merged into the ONE, becomes that One and lives therein.

Before that path is entered, thou must destroy thy lunar body, cleanse thy mind-body and make clean thy heart. The Lunar body is Nephesch, and the Mind body Ruach. The heart is Tiphareth, the centre of Ruach. 43. Eternal lifeís pure waters, clear and crystal, with the monsoon tempestís muddy torrents cannot mingle. We are now again on the subject of suppressing thought. The pure water is the stilled mind, the torrent the mind invaded by thoughts. 44.

Beware, Disciple, suffer not, eíen though it be their shadow, to approach. For it will grow, increase in size and power, and then this thing of darkness will absorb thy being before thou hast well realized the black four monsterís presence. The text returns to the question of suppressing thoughts. Verse 44 has been inserted where it is in the hope of deluding the reader into the belief that it belongs to verses 43 and 45, for the Arcanum which it contains is so dangerous that it must be guarded in all possible ways. Perhaps even to call attention to it is a blind intended to prevent the reader from looking for something else. 46. Before the ìmystic Powerî can make of thee a god, Lanoo, thou must have gained the faculty to slay thy lunar form at will. It is now evident that by destroying or slaying is not meant a permanent destruction. If you can slay a thing at will it means that you can revive it at will, for the word ìfacultyî implies repeated action. 47. The Self of Matter and the Self of Spirit can never meet. One of the twain must disappear; there is no place for both. This is a very difficult verse, because it appears so easy. It is not merely a question of Advaitism, it refers to the spiritual marriage.

It will however be understood that aspiration constantly changes and develops with progress. The beginner can only see a certain distance. Just so with our first telescopes we discovered many new stars, and with each improvement in the instrument we have discovered more.

One single thought about the past that thou hast left behind, will drag thee down and thou wilt have to start the climb anew. Remember Lotís wife. 66. Kill in thyself all memory of past experiences.

Do not believe that lust can ever be killed out if gratified or satiated, for this is an abomination inspired by M‚ra. It is by feeding vÌce that it expands and waxes strong, like to the worm that fattens on the blossomís heart. This verse must not be taken in its literal sense. Hunger is not conquered by starvation. Oneís attitude to all the necessities which the traditions of earthly life involve should be to rule them, neither by mortification nor by indulgence. In order to do the work you must keep in proper physical and mental condition. Be sane. Asceticism always excites the mind, and the object of the Disciple is to calm it. However, ascetic originally meant athletic, and it has only acquired its modern meaning on account of the corruptions that crept into the practices used by those in ìtraining.î The prohibitions, relatively valuable, were exalted into general rules. To ìbreak trainingî is not a sin for anyone who is not in training. Incidentally, it takes all sorts to make a world. Imagine the stupidity of a universe full of Arhans! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. 68. The rose must re-become the bud born of its parent stem, before the parasite has eaten through its heart and drunk its life-sap.

Compare the remark of ìChrist,î ìExcept ye become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,î and also, ìYe must be born again.î It also refers to the overcoming of shame and of the sense of sin. If you think the Temple of the Holy Ghost to be a pig-stye, it is certainly improper to perform therein the Mass of the Graal. Therefore purify and consecrate yourselves; and then, Kings and Priests unto God, perform ye the Miracle of the One Substance. Here is written also the Mystery of Harpocrates.

It implies that the qualities of fire and Spirit commingle to reach the second stage. There is evidently a verse missing, or rather omitted, as may be understood by the row of dots; this presumably refers to the third stage. This third stage may be found by the discerning in Liber DCCCXXXI. 74.

And in the fifth, O slayer of thy thoughts, all these again have to be killed beyond reanimation. It is not sufficient to get rid temporarily of oneís obstacles. One must seek out their roots and destroy them, so that they can never rise again. This involves a very deep psychological investigation, as a preliminary. But the whole matter is one between the Self and its modifications, not at all between the Instrument and its gates. To kill out the sense of sight is nor achieved by removing the eyes.

When thou hast passed into the seventh, O happy one, thou shall perceive no more the sacred three, for thou shalt have become that three thyself. Thyself and mind, like twins upon a line, the star which is thy goal, burns overhead. The three that dwell in glory and in bliss ineffable, now in the world of M‚y‚ have host their names.

It would be a mistake to attach more than a poetic meaning to these remarks upon the sacred Three; but Ego, non-Ego, and That which is formed from their wedding, are here referred to. There are two Triangles of especial importance to mystics; one is the equilateral, the other that familiar to the Past Master in Craft Masonry.

Thou art their conqueror, the Master of the sixth, deliverer of the four modes of Truth. The Light that falls upon them shines from thyself, O thou who wast Disciple but art Teacher now. The five impediments are usually taken to be the five senses. In this case the term ìMaster of the sixthî becomes of profound significance. The ìsixth senseî is the race-instinct, whose common manifestation is in sex; this sense is then the birth of the Individual or Conscious Self with the ìDwarf-Self,î the Silent Babe, Harpocrates.

Behold, all those who knocking for admission, await [sic] in ignorance and darkness, to see the gate of the Sweet Law flung open! This begins with the word ìAnd,î rather as if it were a sequel to The Voice of the Silence. It should not be assumed that this is the case. However, assuming that the first Fragment explains the Path as far as Master of the Temple, it is legitimate to regard this second Fragment, so called, as the further instruction; for the Master of the Temple must leave his personal progress to attend to that of other people, a task from which, 1 am bound to add, even the most patient of Masters feels at times a tendency to revolt! 2. The voice of the Candidates: Shalt not thou, Master of thine own Mercy, reveal the doctrine of the Heart? Shalt thou refuse to lead thy Servants unto the Path of Liberation? One is compelled to remark a certain flavour of sentimentality in the exposition of the ìHeart doctrine,î perhaps due to the increasing age and weight of the Authoress. The real reason of the compassion (so-called) of the Master is a perfectly practical and sensible one. It has nothing to do with the beautiful verses, ìIt is only the sorrows of others Cast their shadows over me.î The Master has learnt the first noble truth: ìEverything is sorrow,î and"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE TWO PATHS 35 he has learnt that there is no such thing as separate existence. Existence is one. He knows these things as facts, just as he knows that two and two make four. Consequently, although he has found the way of escape for that fraction of consciousness which he once called ìI,î and although he knows that not only that consciousness, but all other consciousnesses, are but part of an illusion, yet he feels that his own task is not accomplished while there remains any fragment of consciousness thus unemancipated from illusion. Here we get into very deep metaphysical difficulties, but that cannot be helped, for the Master of the Temple knows that any statement, however simple, involves metaphysical difficulties which are not only difficult, but insoluble. On the plane of which Reason is Lord, all antinomies are irreconcilable. It is impossible for any one below the grade of Magister Templi even to begin to comprehend the resolution of them. This fragment of the imaginary Book of the Golden Precepts must be studied without ever losing sight of this fact. 3. Quoth the Teacher: The Paths are two; the great Perfections three; six are the Virtues that transform the body into the Tree of Knowledge. The ìTree of Knowledgeî is of course another euphe-mism, the ìDragon Treeî representing the uniting of the straight and the curved. A further description of the Tree under which Gautama sat and attained emancipation is unfit for this elementary comment. Aum Mani Padmen hum. 4. Who shall approach them? Who shall first enter them? Who shall first hear the doctrine of two Paths in one, the truth unveiled about the Secret Heart? The Law which, shunning learning, teaches Wisdom, reveals a tale of woe."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 36 This expression ìtwo Paths in oneî is intended to convey a hint that this fragment has a much deeper meaning than is apparent. The key should again be sought in Alchemy. 5. Alas, alas, that all men should possess Alaya, be one with the great Soul, and that possessing it, Alaya should so little avail them! 6. Behold how like the moon, reflected in the tranquil waves, Alaya is reflected by the small and by the great, is mirrored in the tiniest atoms, yet fails to reach the heart of all. Alas, that so few men should profit by the gift, the priceless boon of learning truth, the right perception of existing things, the Knowledge of the nonexistent! This is indeed a serious metaphysical complaint. The solution of it is not to be found in reason. 7. Saith the Pupil: O Teacher, what shall 1 do to reach to Wisdom? O Wise one, what, to gain perfection? 8. Search for the Paths. But, O Lanoo, be of clean heart before thou startest on thy journey. Before thou takest thy first step learn to discern the real from the false, the ever-ileeting from the everlasting. Learn aboye all to separate Head-learning from Soul-Wisdom, the ìEyeî from the ìHeartî doctrine. The Authoress of these treatises is a little exacting in the number of things that you have to do before you take your first step, most of them being things which more nearly resemble the difficulties of the last step. But by learning to distinguish the ìreal from the falseî is only meant a sort of elementary discernment between things that are worth having and those that are not worth having, and, of course, the perception will alter with advance in knowledge.

Chiah is sub-consciousness in its best sense, that subliminal which is sublime. The ìEyeî doctrine then means the exoteric, the ìHeartî doctrine the esoteric. Of course, in a more secret doctrine still, there is an Eye Doctrine which transcends the Heart Doctrine as that transcends this lesser Eye Doctrine. 9. Yea, ignorance is like unto a closed and airless vessel; the soul a bird shut up within. It warbles not, nor can it stir a feather; but the songster mute and torpid sits, and of exhaustion dies. The Soul, Atma, despite its possession of the attributes omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, etc., is entirely bound and blindfolded by ignorance. The metaphysical puzzle to which this gives rise cannot be discussed hereóit is insoluble by reason, though one may call attention to the inherent incommensurability of a postulated absolute with an observed relative. 10. But even ignorance is better than Head-learning with no Soul-wisdom to illuminate and guide it. The word ìbetterî is used rather sentimentally, for, as ìIt is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,î so it is better to be a madman than an idiot. There is always a chance of putting wrong right. As, however, the disease of the age is intellectualism, this lesson is well to teach. Numerous sermons on this point wilI be found in many of the writings of Frater Perdurabo. 11. The seeds of Wisdom cannot sprout and grow in airless space. To live and reap experience the mind needs breadth and depth and points to draw it towards the Diamond Soul. Seek not those points in m„y‰ís realm; but soar beyond illusions, search the eternal and the changeless SAT, mistrusting fancyís false suggestions."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 38 Compare what is said in Book 4, Part II, about the Sword. In the last part of the verse the adjuration is somewhat obvious, and it must be remembered that with progress the realm of Maya constantly expands as that of Sat diminishes. In orthodox Buddhism this process continues indefinitely. There is also the resolution SAT = ASAT. 12. For mind is like a mirror; it gathers dust while it reflects. It needs the gentle breezes of Soul-Wisdom to brush away the dust of our illusions. Seek, O Beginner, to blend thy Mind and Soul. The charge is to eliminate rubbish from the Mind, and teaches that Soul-wisdom is the selective agent. But these Fragments will be most shamefully misinterpreted if a trace of sentimentality is allowed to creep in. ìSoul-wisdomî does not mean ìpietyî and ìnobilityî and similar conceptions, which only flourish where truth is permanently lost, as in England. Soul-wisdom here means the Will. You should eliminate from your mind anything which does not subserve your real purpose. It was, however, said in verse 11 that the ìmind needs breadth,î and this also is true, but if all the facts known to the Thinker are properly coordinated and connected causally, and by necessity, the ideal mind will be attained, for although complex it will be unified. And if the summit of its pyramid be the Soul, the injunction in this verse 12 to the Beginner will be properly observed. 13. Shun ignorance, and likewise shun illusion. Avert thy face from world deceptions; mistrust thy senses, they are false.

Shun praise, O Devotee. Praise leads to self-delusion. Thy body is not Self, thy SELF is in itself without a body, and either praise or blame affects it not. Pride is an expansion of the Ego, and the Ego must be destroyed. Pride is its protective sheath, and hence excep-tionally dangerous, but this is a mystical truth concerning the inner life.

Thereon he sits in prideful solitude and unperceived by any but himself.

False learning is rejected by the Wise, and scattered to the Winds by the good Law. Its wheel revolves for all, the humble and the proud.

It grinds by night and day. The worthless husks it drives from out the golden grain, the refuse from the flour. The hand of karma guides the wheel; the revolutions mark the beatings of the karmic heart. The subject of elimination is here further developed. The favourite Eastern image of the Wheel of the Good Law is difficult to Western minds, and the whole metaphor appears to us somewhat confused. 19. True knowledge is the flour, false learning is the husk. If thou wouldíst eat the bread of Wisdom, thy flour thou hast to knead with Amritaís clear waters. But if thou kneadest husks with M‚y‚ís dew, thou canst create but food for the black doves of death, the birds of birth, decay and sorrow. ìAmritaî means not only Immortality, but is the technical name of the Divine force which descends upon man, but which is burnt up by his tendencies, by the forces which make him what he is. It is also a certain Elixir which is the Menstruum of Harpocrates. Amrita here is best interpreted thus, for it is in opposition to ìM‚y‚.î To interpret illusion is to make confusion more confused. 20. If thou art told that to become Arhat thou hast to cease to love all beingsótell them they lÌe. Here begins an instruction against Asceticism, which has always been the stumbling block most dreaded by the wise. ìChristî said that John the Baptist came neither eating nor"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"THE TWO PATHS 41 drinking, and the people called him mad. He himself came eating and drinking; and they called him a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. The Adept does what he likes, or rather what he wills, and allows nothing to interfere with it, but because he is ascetic in the sense that he has no appetite for the stale stupidities which fools call pleasure, people expect him to refuse things both natural and necessary. Some people are so hypocritical that they claim their dislikes as virtue, and so the poor, weedy, unhealthy degenerate who cannot smoke because his heart is out of order, and cannot drink because his brain is too weak to stand it, or perhaps because his doctor has forbidden him to do either for the next two years, the man who is afraid of life, afraid to do anything lest some result should follow, is acclaimed as the best and greatest of mankind. It is very amusing in England to watch the snobbishness, particularly of the middle classes, and their absurd aping of their betters, while the cream of the jest is that the morality to which the middle classes cling does not exist in good society. Those who have Master Souls refuse to be bound by anything but their own wills. They may refrain from certain actions because their main purpose would be interfered with, just as a man refrains from smoking if he is training for a boat-race; and those in whom cunning is stronger than self-respect sometimes dupe the populace by ostentatiously refraining from certain actions, while, however, they perform them in private. Especially of recent years, some Adepts have thought it wise either to refrain or to pretend to refrain from various things in order to increase their influence. This is a great folly. What is most necessary to demonstrate is that the Adept is not less but more than a man. It is better to hit your enemy and be falsely accused of"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 42 malice, than to refrain from hitting him and be falsely accused of cowardice. 21. If thou art told that to gain liberation thou hast to hate thy mother and disregard thy son; to disavow thy father and call him ìhouseholderî; for man and beast all pity to renounceótell them their tongue is false. This verse explains that the Adept has no business to break up his domestic circumstances. The Rosicrucian Doctrine that the Adept should be a man of the world, is much nobler than that of the hermit. If the Ascetic Doctrine is carried to its logical conclusion, a stone is holier than Buddha himself. Read, however, Liber CLVI. (See The Equinox.) 22. Thus teach the Tirthikas, the unbelievers. It is a little difficult to justify the epithet ìunbelieverîóit seems to me that on the contrary they are the believers. Scepticism is sword and shield to the wise man. But by scepticism one does not mean the sneering infidelity of a Bolingbroke, or the gutter-snipe agnosticism of a Harry Boulter, which are crude remedies against a very vulgar colic. 23. If thou art taught that sin is born of action and bliss of absolute inaction, then tell them that they err. Nonpermanence of human action, deliverance of mind from thralldom by the cessation of sin and faults, are not for ìDeva Egos.î Thus saith the ìDoctrine of the Heart.î This Doctrine is further developed. The term ìdeva Egosî is again obscure. The verse teaches that one should not be afraid to act. Action must be fought by reaction, and tyranny will never be overthrown by slavish submission to it. Cowardice is conquered by a course of exposing oneself"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"THE TWO PATHS 43 unnecessarily to danger. The desire of the flesh has ever grown stronger for ascetics, as they endeavored to combat it by abstinence, and when with old age their functions are atrophied, they proclaim vaingloriously ìI have conquered.î The way to conquer any desire is to understand it, and freedom consists in the ability to decide whether or no you will perform any given action. The Adept should always be ready to abide by the toss of a coin, and remain absolutely indifferent as to whether it falls head or tail. 24. The Dharma (law) of the ìEyeî is the embodiment of the external, and the non-existing. By ìnon-existingî is meant the lower Asat. The word is used on other occasions to mean an Asat which is higher than, and beyond, Sat. 25. The Dharma of the ìHeartî is the embodiment of Bodhi, the Permanent and Everlasting. ìBodhiî implies the root ìLightî in its highest sense of L.V.X. But, even in Hindu Theory, panta ∑ei. 26. The Lamp burns bright when wick and oil are clean. To make them clean a cleaner is required. The flame feels not the process of the cleaning. ìThe branches of the tree are shaken by the wind; the trunk remains unmoved.î This verse again refers to the process of selection and elimination already described. The aspiration must be considered as unaffected by this process except in so far as it becomes brighter and clearer in consequence of it. The last sentence seems again to refer to this question of asceticism. The Adept is not affected by his actions. 27. Both action and inaction may find room in thee; thy body agitated, thy mind tranquil, thy Soul as limpid as a mountain lake."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 44 This repeats the same lesson. The Adept may plunge into the work of the world, and undertake his daily duties and pleasures exactly as another man would do, but he is not moved by them as the other man is. 28. Wouldst thou become a yogin of ìTimeís Circleî? Then, O Lanoo: 29. Believe thou not that sitting in dark forests, in proud seclusion and apart from men; believe thou not that life on roots and plants, that thirst assuaged with snow from the great Rangeóbelieve thou not, O Devotee, that this will lead thee to the goal of final liberation. 30. Think not that breaking bone, that rending flesh and muscle, unites thee to thy ìsilent Self.î Think not, that when the sins of thy gross form are conquered, O Victim of thy Shadows, thy duty is accomplished by nature and by man. Once again the ascetic life is forbidden. It is moreover shown to be a delusion that the ascetic life assists liberation. The ascetic thinks that by reducing himself to the condition of a vegetable he is advanced upon the path of Evolution. It is not so. Minerals have no inherent power of motion save intramolecularly. Plants grow and move, though but little. Animals are free to move o every direction, and space itself is no hindrance to the higher principles of man. Advance is in the direction of more continuous and more untiring energy. 31. The blessed ones have scorned to do so. The Lion of the Law, the Lord of Mercy, perceiving the true cause of human woe, immediately forsook the sweet but selfish rest of quiet wilds. From Aranyani He became the Teacher of mankind. After Julai had entered the Nirvana, He preached on mount and plain, and held discourses in the cities, to devas, men and gods."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"THE TWO PATHS 45 Reference is here made to the attainment of the Buddha. It was only after he had abandoned the Ascetic Life that he attained, and so far from manifesting that attainment by non-action, he created a revolution in India by attacking the Caste system, and by preaching his law created a karma so violent that even today its primary force is still active. The present ìBuddha,î the Master Therion, is doing a similar, but even greater work, by His proclamation: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. 32. Sow kindly acts and thou shalt reap their fruition. Inaction in a deed of mercy becomes an action in a deadly sin. Thus saith the Sage. This continues the diatribe against non-action, and points out that the Ascetic is entirely deluded when he supposes that doing nothing has no effect. To refuse to save life is murder. 33. Shalt thou abstain from action? Not so shall gain thy soul her freedom. To reach Nirvana one must reach Self-Knowledge, and Self-Knowledge is of loving deeds the child. Continues the subject. The basis of knowledge is experience. 34. Have patience, Candidate, as one who fears no failure, courts no success. Fix thy Soulís gaze upon the star whose ray thou art, the flaming star that shines within the lightless depths of ever-being, the boundless fields of the Unknown. The Candidate is exhorted to patience and one-pointedness, and, further to an indifference to the result which comes of true confidence that that result will follow. Cf.

Now the discourse turns to the question of the origin of Evil. The alchemical theory is here set forth.

She further adds that the Dharmakaya body has to be renounced by anyone who wants to help humanity. Now, helping humanity is a very nice thing for those who like it, and no doubt those who do so deserve well of their fellows.

In fact, one who is helping humanity is constantly in need of a wash and brush-up from time to time. There is nothing quite so contaminating as humanity, especially Theosophists, as Mme.

Obviously it does not refer to the great choice referred to in Fragment II, verse 88. One is inclined further to suspect that Madame Blavatsky supposes Mah‚y‚na and Hinay‚na to refer in some way or other to the two Paths previously discussed. They do not. Madame Blavatskyís method of exegesis, in the absence of original information, was to take existing commentators and disagree with them, her standard being what the unknown originals ought, in her opinion, to have said. This method saves much of the labour of research, and with a little luck it ought to be possible to discover subsequently much justification in the originals as they become known. Madame Blavatsky was justified in employing this method because she really did know the subject better than either commentator or original. She merely used Oriental lore as an Ostrich hunter uses the skin of a dead bird. She was Ulysses, and the East her Wooden Horse.

Prepare thyself, for thou wilt have to travel on alone. The Teacher can but point the way. The Path is one for all, the means to reach the goal must vary with the Pilgrims. It is here admitted that there are many ways of reaching the same end. In order to assist a pupil, the Teacher should know all these ways by actual experience. He should know them in detail. There is a great deal of pious gassing about most Teachersóit is very easy to say ìBe good and you will be happy,î and I am afraid that even this book itself has been taken as little better by the majority of its admirers. What the pupil wants is not vague generalizations on virtue, not analyses of Nirv‚na and explorations in Hindu metaphysics, but a plain straightforward statement of a practical character. When a man is meditating and finds himself interfered with by some particular class of thought, he does not want to know about the glory of the Buddha and the advantages of the Dhamma and the fraternal piety of the Sangha. He wants to know how to stop those thoughts arising, and the only person who can help him to do that is a Teacher who has been troubled by those same thoughts, and learnt how to stop them in his own case. For one Teacher who knows his subject at all, there are at least ten thousand who belch pious platitudes.

The way to discover whether a Teacher knows anything about it or not is to do the work yourself, and see if your understanding of him improves, or whether he fobs you off in your hour of need with remarks on Virtue. 3. Which wilt thou choose, O thou of dauntless heart? The Samtan of ìEye Doctrine,î four-fold Dhy‚na, or thread thy way through P‚ramit‚s, six in number, noble gates of virtue leading to Bodhi and to Pragny‚, seventh step of Wisdom? It must not be supposed that the Paths here indicated are ah. Apparently the writer is still harping on the same old two Paths. It appears that ìfourfold Dhy‚naî is a mere extension of the word Samtan. There are, however, eight, not four, four of these being called Low and four High. They are defined in Rhys-Davidsí Buddhism, p. 174-6. The Buddha just before his death went through all these stages of meditation which are described in the paragraph here quoted: Then the Blessed One addressed the Brethren, and said: ìBehold now, brethren, I exhort you, saying, ëDecay is inherent in all component things! Work out your saivation with diligence! This was the last word of the Tathagata! Then the Blessed One entered into the first stage of deep meditation. And rising out of the first stage he passed into the second. And rising out of the second he passed into the third. And rising out of the third stage he passed into the fourth. And rising out of the fourth stage of deep meditation he entered into the state of mind to which the infinity of space is alone present. And passing out of the mere consciousness of the infinity of space he entered into the state of mind to which the infinity of thought is alone present.

And passing out of the consciousness of no special object he feil into a state between consciousness and unconsciousness. And passing out of the state between consciousness and unconsciousness he fell into a state in which the unconsciousness both of sensations and of ideas had wholly passed away. What rubbish! Here we have a man with no experience of the states which he is trying to describe; for Prof. Rhys-Davids, many though are his virtues, is not Buddha, and this man is attempting to translate highly technical terms into a language in which those technical terms not only have no equivalent, but have nothing in the remotest degree capable of being substituted for an equivalent. This is characteristic of practically all writing on Eastern thought. What was wanted was a Master of some Occidental language to obtain the experiences of the East by undertaking the practices of the East. His own experience put into words would then form a far better translation of Oriental works on the same subject, than any translation which a scholar might furnish. I am inclined to think that this was Blavatskyís method. So obvious a forgery as this volume only contains so much truth and wisdom because this is the case. The Masteró alike of Language and of Experienceóhas at hast arisen; it is the Master TherionóThe Beastó666óthe Logos of the ∆on ówhose Word is ìDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.î 4. The rugged Path of four-fold Dhy‚na winds on uphill. Thrice great is he who climbs the lofty top. 5. The P‚ramit‚ heights are crossed by a still steeper path.

But it may well be asked whether these Paths are mutually exclusive, whether a good man is always an idiot and a clever man always a brute, to put the antithesis on a somewhat lower plane. Does anyone really think that one can reach supreme mental control while there are ìseven cruel, crafty powers, passions incarnate,î worrying you? The fact is that this dichotomy of the Path is rather dramatic than based on experience. 6. Be of good cheer, Disciple; bear in mind the golden rule. Once thou hast passed the gate Srot‚patti, ìhe who the stream hath enteredî; once thy foot hath pressed the bed of the Nirv‚nic stream in this or any future life, thou hast but seven other births before thee, O thou of adamantine Will. The author does not state what is meant by the ìgolden rule.î A Srot‚patti is a person in such a stage that he will become Arhan after seven more incarnations.1 There is nothing in Buddhism about the voluntary undertaking of incarnations in order to help mankind. And of course the talk about ìNirv‚nic blissî is misleading when one reflects that this quality of bliss or Ananda arising with the first Jhana, has already disappeared, never to return, in the second. The whole question of Nibbana is hopelessly entangled with moonshine metaphysic and misinter-pretation and false tradition. It must be remembered that Nibbana is merely the Pali, the vulgar dialect, for the Sanskrit NIRVANA, and that Nirv‚na is a state characterizing Moksha, which is the liberation resulting from Nirvikalpa-Sam‚dhi. But then Mokhsa is defined by the Hindus as    1 See Crowleyís ìThe Three Characteristicsî in his The Sword of Song for an amusing but illuminated story on this state."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 73 unity with Parabrahman; and Parabrahman is without quantity or quality, not subject to change in any way, altogether beyond Manvantara and Pralaya; and so on. In one sense he is pure ¬tman. Now the Buddhist rejects ¬tman, saying there is no such thing. Thereforeóto himóthere is no Parabrahman. There is really Mah‚ Brahm‚, who is (ultimately) subject to change, and, when the Karma which has made him Mah‚ Brahm‚ is exhausted, may be reincarnated as a pig or a Pisacha. Consequently Moksha is not liberation at all, for Nirv‚na means cessation of that which, after however long a period, may change. This is all clear enough, but then the Buddhist goes on and takes the word Nibbana to mean exactly that which the Hindus meant by Nirvana, insisting strenuously that it is entirely different. And so indeed it is. But if one proceeds further to enquire, ìThen what is it?î one finds oneself involved in very considerable difficulty. It is a difficulty which I cannot pretend to solve, even by the logic which obtains above the abyss. I can, however, exhibit the difficulty by relating a conversation which I had with Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya in November, 1906, while I was staying with him in his Monastery outside Rangoon. I was arguing that result was the direct effect of the work of the student. If he went on long enough he was bound to succeed, and he might reasonably infer a causal connection between his work and its result. The Bhikkhu was not unwilling to admit that this might be so in such elementary stages as Jh‚na, but with regard to the attaining of Arhatship he argued that it depended rather on universal Karma than on that created by the aspirant. Avoiding metaphysical quibbles as to whether these two kinds of Karma are not identical, he figured the situation in this manner. There are two wheels, one of which is the wheel of Nibbana, and the"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 74 other that of the attainment of the Adept. These two wheels only touch at one point. Now the Arhat may reach the circumference of his wheel, that is, the summit of his attainment, as often as he likes, but unless he happens to do so at the moment when that point touches the wheel of Nibbana, he will not become an Arhat, and it is therefore necessary for him to remain at that summit as long as possible, in fact always, in order that bye and byeóit might be after many incarnations of perfectionóthese two might coincide. This perfection he regarded not as that of spiritual experience, but as the attainment of Sila, and by Sila he meant the strict observance of the rules laid down by the Buddha for the Bhikkhu. He continued that the Buddha had apparently attached far more importance to virtue than to any degree of spiritual attainment, placing the well-behaved Bhikkhu not only above the gods, but above the greatest Yogis. (It is obvious, to the Buddhist, that Hindu Yogis, however eminent, are not Arhats.) He said that the rules laid down for Bhikkhus created the conditions necess-ary. A good Bhikkhu, with no spiritual experience, had at least some chance, whereas the bad Bhikkhu or non--Bhikkhu, although every form of Sam‚dhi was at his fingersí ends, had none. The point is very important, because on this theory the latter, after all his attainments, might pass through all the Dhyana-Lokas and through the Arupa-Brahma-Lokas, exhaust that Karma, be reincarnated as a SpirochÊtes Pallida, and have to begin over again. And the most virtuous Bhikkhu might be so unfortunate as to fall from Virtue the millionth part of a second before his point on the circumference of the sphere was going to touch that of the wheel of Nibbana, regain it two millionths of a second later, and thus find Arhat-ship indefinitely postponed. I then said: O most excellent expounder of the good"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 75 Law, prithee explain to me the exact difference between this Doctrine and that which we heard from Shri Par‚nanda that the attainment of Sam‚dhi, though it depended to some extent upon the attainment of the Yogi, depended also upon the grace of the Lord Shiva, and that Yoga did us no good unless the Lord Shiva happened to be in a good temper. Then the Bhikkhu rephied in a dramatic whisper, ìThere is no difference, except that it is not Buddhism.î From this example the Student will understand that he had better not worry about Nibb‚na and its nature, but confine himself to controlling his thoughts. 7. Look on. What seeíst thou before thine eye, O aspirant to god-like Wisdom? 8. ìThe cloak of darkness is upon the deep of matter; within its folds I struggle.

It is the shadow of thyself outside the PATH, cast on the darkness of thy sins. This charming poetic image should not be taken literally. 10. ìYea, Lord; I see the PATH; its foot in mire, its summit lost in glorious hight Nirv‚nic.

These Portals head the aspirant across the waters on ìto the other shore.î Each Portal hath a golden key that openeth its gate; and these keys are:ó The expression ìthe other shoreî is particularly unfortunate, owing to its associations in English minds with the hymn usually known as ìThe sweet bye and bye.î It is a metaphor for which there is little justification. Nirv‚na is frequently spoken of as an island in Buddhist writings, but I am not familiar with any passage in which the metaphor is that of a place at the other end of a journey. The metaphor moreover is mixed. In the hast verse he was climbing a ladder; now he is going across the waters, and neither on ladders nor in journeys by water does one usually pass through Portals. 12. 1. DANA, the key of charity and hove immortal. 2. SHILA, the key of Harmony in word and act, the key that counterbalances the cause and the effect, and leaves no further room for Karmic action. 3.

VIRYA, the dauntless energy that fights its way to the supernal TRUTH, out of the mire of lies terrestrial. 6.

PRAJNA, the key to which makes of a man a God, creating him a Bodhisattva, son of the Dhy‚nis. Such to the Portals are the golden keys. (Subsection I.)

This love is not a sloppy feeling of maudlin sentimental kindness. The majority of people of the Christian Science, Theosophical, New Thought type, think that a lot of flabby thoughts, sending out streams of love in the Six Quarters, and so on, will help them. It wonít. Love is a pure flame, as swift and deadly as the lightning. This is the kind of love that the Student needs. (Subsection II.) The ìkeyî here spoken of has been thoroughly explained in Thien Tao in Konx Om Pax, but there is a peculiar method, apart from this plane, and easily understood by the equilibrium by which things can be done which bear no fruit. And this method it is quite impossible to explain. The nearest I can come to intelligibility, is to say that you get very nearly the same sort of feeling as you do when you are making yourself invisible. Shila is in no way connected with the charming Irish colleen of the same name. (Subsection III.) The ìpatienceî here spoken of seems to imply courage of a very active kind. It is the quality which persists in spite of all opposition. It must not be forgotten that the word ìpatienceî is derived from Patior, ìI suffer.î But, especially with the ancients, suffering was not conceived of as a purely passive function. It was keenly active and intensely enjoyable. There are certain words today still extant in which the original meaning of this word lingers, and consideration may suggest to the Student the true and secret meaning of this passage, ìAccendat in nobis Dorninus ignem sui amoris et flammam ÊternÊ caritatis,î a phrase with the subtle ambiguity which the classics found the finest form of wit. (Subsection IV.) This indifference is very much the same as what is usually spoken of as non-attachment. The"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 78 Doctrine has been rediscovered in the West, and is usually announced as ìArt for Artís sake.î This quality is most entirely necessary in Yoga. In times of dryness the ìDevilî comes to you and persuades you that if you go on meditating or doing Pran‚y‚ma, or whatever it is you may be at, you will go mad. He will also prove to you that it is most necessary for your spiritual progress to repose. He will explain that, by the great law of action and reaction, you should alternate the task which you have set out to do with something else, that you should, in fact, somehow or other change your plans. Any attempt to argue with him will assuredly result in defeat. You must be able to reply, ìBut I am not in the least interested in my spiritual progress; I am doing this because I put it down in my programme to do it. It may hurt my spiritual progress more than anything in the world. That does not matter. I will gladly be damned eternally, but I will not break my obligation in the smallest detail.î By doing this you come out at the other end, and discover that the whole controversy was illusion. One does become blind; one does have to fight oneís way through the ocean of asphalt. Hope and Faith are no more. All that can be done is to guard Love, the original source of your energy, by the mask of indifference. This image is a little misleading, perhaps. It must not be supposed that the indifference is a cloak; it must be a real indifference. Desire of any kind must really be conquered, for of course every desire is as it were a string on you to pull you in some direction, and it must be remembered that Nirv‚na lies (as it were) in no direction, like the fourth dimension in space. (Subsection V.) Virya is, etymologically, Manhood. It is that quality which has been symbolized habitually by the Phallus, and its importance is sufficient to have made the Phallus an universal symbol, apart altogether from reasons"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 79 connected with the course of nature. Yet these confirm the choice. It is freeóit has a will of its own quite independent of the conscious will of the man bearing it. It has no conscience. It leaps. It has no consideration for anything but its own purpose. Again and again this symbol in a new sense will recur as the type of the ideal. It is a symbol alike of the Beginning, the Way and the End. In this particular passage it is however principally synonymous with Will, and Will has been so fully dealt with in Book 4, Part II, that it will save trouble if we assume that the reader is familiar with that masterpiece. (Subjection VI.) This, too, has been carefully described in Book 4, Part I. There is a distinction between Buddhist ìJh‚naî and Sanskrit Dhy‚na, though etymologically the former is a corruption of the latter. The craze for classification which obsesses the dull minds of the learned has been peculiarly pernicious in the East. In order to divide states of thought into 84 classes, which isóto their fatuity!óan object in itself, because 84 is seven times twelve, they do not hesitate to invent names for quite imaginary states of mind, and to put down the same state of mind several times. This leads to extreme difficulty in the study of their works on psychology and the like. The original man, Buddha, or whoever he may have been, dug out of his mind a sufficient number of jewels, and the wretched intellectuals who edited his work have added bits of glass to make up the string. The result has been that many scholars have thought that the whole psychology of the East was pure bluff. A similar remark is true of the philosophy of the West, where the Schoolmen produced an equal obfuscation.

In point of fact, it is the critic who is stupid. The question about the angels involves the profoundest considerations of metaphysics, and it was about these that the battle raged. I fancy that their critics imagine the Schoolmen disputing whether the number was 25 or 26, which argues their own shallowness by the readiness with which they attribute the same quality to others. However, a great deal of mischief has been done by the pedant, and the distinctions between the various Jh‚nas will convey little to the Western mind, even of a man who has some experience of them. The question of mistranslation alone renders the majority of Buddhist documents, if not valueless, at least unreliable. We, however, taking this book as an original work by Blavatsky, need not be bothered by any doubts more deadly than that as to whether her command of English was perfect; and in this treatise, in spite of certain obvious sentimentalities and bombasticisms, we find at least the foundations of a fairly fine style. I think that what she says in this subsection refers to a statement which I got from my Guru in Madura to the effect that there was a certain point in the body suitable for meditation, which, if once discovered, drew the thought naturally towards itself, the difficulty of concentration consequently disappearing, and that the knowledge of this particular point could be communicated by the Guru to his approved disciples. (Subsection VII.) We now find a muddle between the keys and the gates. The first five are obviously keys. The last two seem to be gates, in spite of the statements in the text.

Before thou canst approach the last, O weaver of thy freedom, thou hast to master these P‚ramit‚s of perfectionóthe virtues transcendental six and ten in numberóalong the weary Path. We now get back to the P‚ramit‚s, and this treatise is apparently silent with regard to them. Does any one regret it? It isnít the Path that is weary: it is the Sermons on the way. 14. For, O Disciple! Before thou wert made fit to meet thy Teacher face to face, thy MASTER light to light, what wert thou told? The old trouble recurs. We cannot tell quite clearly in what stage the Disciple is supposed to be with regard to any given piece of instruction. 15. Before thou canst approach the foremost gate thou hast to learn to part thy body from thy mind, to dissipate the shadow, and to live in the eternal. For this, thou hast to live and breathe in all, as all that thou perceivest breathes in thee; to feel thyself abiding in all things, all things in SELF. In verse 13 we were told to master the P‚ramit‚s before approaching the last gate. Now the author harks back to what he had to do before he approached the first gate, but this may be regarded as a sort of a joke on the part of the Guru. The Guru has a weary time, and frequently amuses himself by telling the pupil that he must do something obviously impossible before he begins. This increases the"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 82 respect of the pupil for the Guru, and in this way helps him, while at the same time his air of hopelessness is intensely funnyóto the Guru. So we find in this verse that the final result, or something very like it, is given as a qualification antecedent to the starting point; as if one told a blind man that he must be able to see through a brick wall before regaining his eyesight. 16. Thou shalt not let thy senses make a playground of thy mind. Following on the tremendous task of verse 15 comes the obvious elementary piece of instruction which one gives to a beginner. The best way out of the dilemma is to take verse 15 in a very elementary sense. Let us paraphrase that verse. ìTry to get into the habit of thinking of your mind and body as distinct. Attach yourself to matters of eternal importance, and do not be deluded by the idea that the material universe is real. Try to realize the unity of being.î That is a sensible and suitable instruction, a kind of adumbration of the goal. It harmonizes emotional and intellectual conceptions toóthat which subsequently turns out not to be reality. 17. Thou shalt not separate thy being from BEING, and the rest, but merge the Ocean in the deep, the drop within the Ocean. This too can be considered in an elementary light as meaning: ìBegin even at once to destroy the sense of separateness.î 18. So shalt thou be in full accord with all that lives; bear love to men as though they were thy brother-pupils, disciples of one Teacher, the sons of one sweet mother. It now becomes clear that ah this is meant in an elementary sense, for verse 18 is really little more than a statement that an irritable frame of mind is bad for meditation.

Of teachers there are many; the MASTER-SOUL is one, Alaya, the Universal Soul. Live in that MASTER as ITS ray in thee. Live in thy fellows as they live in IT. Here the killing of the sense of separateness is further advised. It is a description of the nature of Atman, and Atman is, as elsewhere stated, not a Buddhist, but a Hindu idea. The teaching is here to refer everything to Atman, to regard everything as a corruption of Atman, if you please, but a corruption which is unreal, because Atman is the only real thing. There is a similar instruction in Liber Legis: ìLet there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thingî; and you are urged not to ìconfound the space-marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many.î 20. Before thou standest on the threshold of the Path; before thou crossest the foremost Gate, thou hast to merge the two into the One and sacrifice the personal to SELF impersonal, and thus destroy the ìpathî between the twoóAntas-Karana.

Thou hast to be prepared to answer Dharma, the stern law, whose voice will ask thee first at thy initial step: 22. ìHast thou complied with the rules, O thou of lofty hopes? ìHast thou attuned thy heart and mind to the great mind and heart of all mankind?

What is the sense of asking a man at his initial step if he has complied with all the rules? If the disciple were in the condition mentioned, he would be already very far advanced. But of course if we were to take the words ìThe threshold of the Pathî ìThe foremost gateî ìThe streamî as equivalent to Srot‚patti, the passage would gain in intelligibility. But, just as in the noble eight-fold Path, the steps are concurrent, not consecutive, so, like the Comte de Saint Germain, when he was expelled from Berlin, one can go through all the seven Gates at once. 23. Disciples may be likened to the strings of the soulechoing Vin‚; mankind, unto its sounding board; the hand that sweeps it to the tuneful breath of the GREAT WORLD-SOUL.

This is a somewhat high-flown descriptionóit is little more than an advocacy of docility, a quiet acceptance of the situation as it is, and an acquiescence in the ultimate sublime purpose. The question of the crossing of the abyss now arises, and we reach a consideration of the Brothers of the Left Hand Path. 24. Thus do the ìBrothers of the Shadowîóthe murder-ers of their Souls, the dread Dad-Dugpa clan. ìThe Brothers of the Shadowî or of the Left Hand Path are very carefully explained in Liber 418. The Exempt"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 85 Adept, when he has to proceed, has a choice either to fling himself into the Abyss by all that he has and is being torn away, or to shut himself up to do what he imagines to be continuing with his personal development on very much the original lines. This latter course does not take him through the Abyss; but fixes him in Da‰th, at the crown of a false Tree of Life in which the Supernal Triad is missing. Now this man is also called a Black Magician, and a great deal of confusion has arisen in connection with this phrase. Even the Author, to judge by the Note, seems to confuse the matter. Red Caps and Yellow Gaps alike are in general altogether beneath the stage of which we have been speaking. And from the point of view of the Master of the Temple, there is very little to choose between White and Black Magic as ordinarily understood by the man in the Street, who distinguishes between them according as they are helpful or hurtful to himself. If the Magician cures his headache, or gives him a good tip on the Stock Exchange, he is a White Magician. If he suspects him of causing illness and the like, he is Black. To the Master of the Temple either proceeding appears blind and stupid. In the lower stages there is only one way right, and all the rest wrong. You are to aspire to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and of course to do any other things which may subserve that one purpose; but nothing else. And of course it is a mistake, unless under very special circum-stances, to perform any miracles, on the ground that they diminish the supreme energy reserved for the performance of the Main Task. It will be remembered that the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is attributed to Tiphareth, while the Exempt Adept is in Chesed; how is it then that a Black Magician, a Brother of the Left Hand Path, can ever reach that grade? The answer"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 86 is given in the eleventh ∆thyr; when the Exempt Adept reaches the Frontier of the Abyss, his Holy Guardian Angel leaves him, and this is the one supreme terror of that passage. It seems extraordinary that one who has ever enjoyed His Knowledge and Conversation should afterwards fall away into that blind horror whose name is Choronzon. But such is the case. Some of the problems, or rather, mysteries, connected with this are too deep to enter upon in this place, but the main point to remember is this, that in the Outer Order, and in the College of Adepts itself, it is not certain to what end any one may come. The greatest and holiest of the Exempt Adepts may, in a single moment, become a Brother of the Left Hand Path. It is for this reason that the Great White Brotherhood admits no essential connection with the lower branches affiliated to The Order. At the same time, The Brothers of the A∴A∴ refuse none. They have no objection to any one claiming to be one of Themselves. If he does so, let him abide by it. 25. Hast thou attuned thy being to Humanityís great pain, O candidate for light?

It appears as if the condition of entering the Path was the Vision of Sorrow, and of course the present Commentator might be inclined to support this theory, since, in his own experience, it was this Vision of Sorrow which caused him to take the First Great Oath. He had suddenly presented to him the perception of the Three Characteristics. This is fully narrated in Book 4, Part IV. It is also evident that aspiration implies dissatisfaction of some sort. But at the"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 87 same time I do not think that in all cases it is necessary that this dissatisfaction should be so conscious and so universal as appears to be implied in the text. 26. Armed with the key of Charity, of love and tender mercy, thou art secure before the gate of D‚na, the gate that standeth at the entrance of the path. 27. Behold, O happy Pilgrim! The portal that faceth thee is high and wide, seems easy of access. The road that heads therethrough is straight and smooth and green. ëTis hike a sunny glade in the dark forest depths, a spot on earth mirrored from Amit‚bhaís paradise. There, nightingales of hope and birds of radiant plumage sing perched in green bowers, chanting success to fearless Pilgrims. They sing of Bodhisattvaís virtues five, the fivefold source of Bodhi power, and of the seven steps in Knowledge. 28. Pass on! For thou hast brought the key; thou art secure. The row of dots in the text (after verse 25) appears to imply complete change of subject, though on other occasions it did not do so. I have already explained one of the tech-nical meanings of D‚na, and undoubtedly the Path seems attractive at this stage. One thinks of the joyous reception into the Company of Adepts. One goes almost as a boy goes to meet his first sweetheart. But there is here another allusion to the beginnings of Meditation, when everything seems so simple and straightforward, and withal so easy and pleasant. There is something intensely human about this. Men set out upon the most dangerous expeditions in high spirits. 29. And to the second gate the way is verdant too.

Beware of fear that spreadeth, like the black and soundless wings of midnight bat, between the moonlight of thy Soul and thy great goal that loometh in the distance far away. This passage also appears to have reference to the early life of the Studentóhence he is specially warned against fear. Fear is, of course, the first of the pylons through which one passes in the Egyptian system. It is important then to arrange oneís life in such a way that one never allows one thing to interfere with another, and one never makes trouble for oneself. The method given in Thien Tao is the best to employ. 31. Fear, O disciple, kills the will and stays all action. If lacking in the Shila virtueóthe pilgrim trips, and Karmic pebbles bruise his feet along the rocky path. The objection to fear is not only the obvious one. Fear is only one of the things which interfere with concentration. The reaction against fear leads to over-boldness. Anything which interferes with the perfect unconscious simplicity of oneís going leads to bruises. Troubles of this kind may be called Karmic, because it is events in the past which give occasion for trouble. 32. Be of sure foot, O Candidate.

Close not thine eyes, nor lose thy sight of Dorje (the Svastika); M‚raís arrows ever smite the man who has not reached Vair‚ga. ìGlose not thine eyesî may refer to sleep or to ecstasy, perhaps to both. Dorje is the whirling power which throws off from itself every other influence. Vair‚ga is a very definite stage in moral strength. The point is that it is oneís intense longing for ecstasy which makes one yield to it. If one does so, one is overwhelmed with the illusion, for even the highest ecstasy is still illusion. The result, in many cases, of obtaining Dhy‚na is that the workers cease to work. Vair‚ga is an indifference approach-ing disgust for everything. It reminds one a good deal of the Oxford Manner. Cambridge men have this feeling, but do not think other people worth the trouble of flattering. 34. Beware of trembling. íNeath the breath of fear the key of ksh‚nti rusty grows: the rusty key refuseth to unlock. The word ìtremblingî seems to imply that it is giddy ecstasy which is referred to, and the ìfearî here spoken of may perhaps be the Panic Fear, possibly some feeling analogous to that which produces what is called psychical impotence. 35.

It is true that the further one advances the more subtle and deadly are the enemies, up to the crossing of the Abyss; and, as far as one can judge, the present discourse does not rise above Tiphareth. I am very sorry to have to remark at this point that Madame Blavatsky is now wholly obsessed by her own style. She indulges, much more than in the earlier part of this treatise, in poetic and romantic imagery, and in Miltonic inversion. (I do not here refer to Lycidas.) Consequently we get quite a long passage on a somewhat obvious point, and the Evil Persona or Dweller of the Threshold is introduced. However, it is a correct enough place. That Dweller is Fearóhis form is Dispersion. It is in this sense that Satan, or rather Samael, a totally different person, the accuser of the Brethren, is the Devil. 36. Beware, disciple, of that lethal shade. No light that shines from Spirit can dispel the darkness of the nether Soul unless all selfish thought has fled therefrom, and that the pilgrim saith: ìI have renounced this passing frame; I have destroyed the cause; the shadows cast can, as effects, no longer be.î For now the last great fight, the final war between the Higher and the Lower Self, hath taken place. Behold, the very battlefield is now engulphed in the great war, and is no more. The quotation is only proper in the mouth of a Buddha, from whom it is taken. At this point the Higher and Lower Selves are united. It is a mistake to represent their contest as a waróit is a wedding. 37.

It is the mental changes and the invading thoughts which distress us. These are to be understood in a rather advanced sense, for of course thought must have been conquered earlier than this, that is to say, the self must have been separated from its thoughts, so that they no longer disturb that self. Now, however, the fortress walls must be thrown down, and the mind slain in the open field. 39. If thou wouldíst not be slain by them, then must thou harmless make thy own creations, the children of thy thoughts unseen, impalpable, that swarm round humankind, the progeny and heirs to man and his terrestrial spoils.

The meaning is again very much confused by the would-be poetic diction, but it is quite clear that desire of any kind must not interfere with this intensely intellectual meditation; and of course the whole object of it is to refrain from preferring any one thing to any other thing. When it says that ìA thought as fleeting as the lightning flash will make thee thy three prizes forfeitóthe prizes thou hast won,î this does not mean that if you happen to make a mistake in meditation you have to begin all over again as an absolute beginner, and yet, of course, in any meditation the occurrence of a single break destroys, for the moment, the effect of what has gone immediately before. Whenever one is trying for cumulative effect, something of this sort is true. One gets a sort of Leyden Jar effect; but the sentence as it stands is misleading, as she explains further on in verse 70óìEach failure is success, and each sincere attempt wins its reward in time.î 41.

X = Y is furiously denied by both, although these two equations are our only source of information about either X or Y. Metaphysics has always been full of this airy building. We must postulate an Unseen behind the Seen; and when we have defined the Unseen as a round square, we quarrel with our fellow-professors who prefer to define it as a quadrilateral circle. The only way to avoid this is to leave argument altogether alone, and pay attention only to concentration, until the time comes to tackle mental phenomena once for all, by some such method as that of Liber CDLXXIV. (See The Equinox, vol. I, no. 7.) 42. ìThe eight dire miseries forsake for evermore. If not, to wisdom, sure, thou caníst not come, nor yet to liberation,î saith the great Lord, the Tath‚gata of perfection, ìhe who has followed in the footsteps of his predecessors.î ìThe eight dire miseriesî are the five senses plus the threefold fire of Lust, Hatred and Dullness.

If thou its Path wouldíst master, thou must keep thy mind and thy perceptions far freer than before from killing action. The English is getting ambiguous. The word ìkillingî is, I suppose, an adjective implying ìfatal to the purpose of the Student.î But even so, the comment appears to me out of place. On this high Path action should already have been made harmless; in fact, the second Path had this as its principal object.

This means, acquire sympathy with the universal Soul of Nature. This Soul of Nature here spoken of is of course imagined as something entirely contrary to anything we really know of Nature. In fact, it would be difficult to distinguish it from a pious fiction. The only reason that can be given for assuming the Soul of Nature to be pure, calm, kind, and all the other tea-party virtues, is Lucus a non lucendo. To put it in some kind of logical form, the Manifested is not the Unmanifested; therefore the Manifested is that which the Unmanifested is not. Nature, as we know it, is stupid, brutal, cruel, beautiful, extravagant, and above all the receptacle or vehicle of illimitable energy. However by meditation one comes to a quite different view of Nature. Many of the stupidities and brutalities are only apparent. The beauty, the energy, and the majesty, or, if you prefer it, the love, remain undeniable. It is the first reversed triangle of the Tree of Life. What is said of ìSamvrittiî is nonsense. The Vritis are impressions or the causes of impressions. Samvritti is simply the sum of these. 45. All is impermanent in man except the pure bright essence of Alaya. Man is its crystal ray; a beam of light immaculate within, a form of clay material upon the lower surface. That beam is thy life-guide and thy true Self, the Watcher and the silent Thinker, the victim of thy lower Self. Thy Soul cannot be hurt but through thy erring body; control and master both, and thou art safe when crossing to the nearing ìGate of Balance.î Here we have Alaya identified with Atma.

Be of good cheer, O daring pilgrim ìto the other shore.î Heed not the whisperings of M‚raís hosts; wave off the tempters, those ill-natured Sprites, the jealous Llamayin in endless space. This verse may be again dismissed as too easily indulgent in poetic diction. A properly controlled mind should not be subject to these illusions. And although it may be conceded that these things, although illusions, do correspond with a certain reality, anything objective should have been dismissed at an earlier stage. In the mental struggles there should be no place for demons. Unless my memory deceives me, that was just the one trouble that I did not have. The reason may possibly have been that I had mastered all external demons before I took up meditation. 47. Hold firm!

From here to verse 71 is the long description of this fifth gate, the key to which (it will be remembered) was Viryaóthat is, energy and will, Manhood in its most secret sense.

Have mastery oíer thy Soul, O seeker after truths undying, if thou wouldíst reach the goal. The pupil is also told to have mastery over his Soul, and again there is no indication as to what is meant by ìSoul.î Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya once remarked that Theo-sophists were rather absurd to call themselves Buddhists, as the Buddhist had no Soul, and the Theosophist, not even content with having one, insisted on possessing seven different kinds. If it means Nephesch, of course this ought to have been mastered long ago. It probably means Neschamah. If we take this to be so, the whole passage will become intelligible. In the beginning of progress we have the automatic Ego, the animal creator or generator of Nephesch in Yesod, the lowest point of the Ruach, and the marriage between these is the first regeneration. Nephesch is Syrinx, and Yesod is Pan. Nephesch is the elemental Soul which seeks redemption and immortality. In order to obtain it, it must acquire a Soul such as is possessed by men. Now the elemental is said to be afraid of the sword with its cross hilt, of the Cross, that is to say of the Phallus, and this is what is called Panic fear, which, originally an individual thing, is applied to a mob, because a mob has no Soul. A very great many elementals are to be found in human form today; they are nearly always women, or such men as are not men. Such beings are imitative, irresponsible, always being shocked, without any standard of truth, although often extremely logical; criminal without a sense of right and wrong, and as shameless as they are prudish.

This doctrine is magnificently expounded in Wagnerís Parsifal. The way to redeem such creatures is to withstand them, and their Path of Redemption is the Path of Service to the man who has withstood them. However, when at the right moment the crucified one, the extended one, the Secret Saviour, consents to redeem them, and can do so without losing his power, without in any way yielding to them, their next step is accomplished, and they are reborn as men. This brings us back to our subject, for the lower man, of whom we are still speaking, possesses, above Yesod, five forms of intellect and Da‰th their Crown. We then come to another marriage on a higher plane, the redemption of Malkuth by Tiphareth; the attaining of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The next critical step is the sacrificing of this whole organism to the Mother, Neschamah, a higher South which is as spiritually dark and lonely as Nephesch was materially. Neschamah is beyond the Abyss, has no concern with that bridal, but to absorb it; and by offering the blood of her Son to the All-Father, that was her husband, she awakes Him. He, in His turn, vitalizes the original Daughter, thus competing the cycle. Now on the human plane this All-Father is the true generative force, the real Ego, of which all types of conscious Ego in a man are but Eidola, and this true creative force is the virya of which we are now speaking. 50.Thy Soul-gaze centre on the One Pure Light, the Light that is free from affection, and use thy golden Key. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Thou hast removed pollution from thine heart and bled it from impure desire. But, O thou glorious combatant, thy task is not yet done.

The aspirant is now in fact beyond thought, and this talk of building high the wall or dam is too much like poetry to be good sense. What it means is, ìBeware lest the reawakened Ego, the Chiah, should become self-conscious, as it is hable to do owing to its wedding with Neschamah.î Or, shall we say, with Nephesch? For the organism has now been brought to perfect harmony in all its parts. The Adept has a strong, healthy, vigorous body, and a mind no less perfect; he is a very different person from the feeble emasculate cabbage-chewing victim of anÊmia, with its mind which has gained what it calls emancipation by forgetting how to think. Little as it ever knew! Not in such may one find the true Adept. Read Liber Legis, chap. II, verse 24, and learn where to look for hermits. 55. A sense of pride would mar the work.

More trouble, more poetic image, more apparent sentimentality. Its true interpretation is to be found in the old symbolism of this rearrange of Chiah and Neschamah. Chiah is the male, proof against seduction; Neschamah the female that overcomes by weakness. But in actual practice the meaning may be explained thus,óyou yourself have conquered, you have become perfectly indifferent, perfectly energetic, perfectly creative, but, having united yourself to the Universe, you become acutely conscious that your own fortunate condition is not shared by that which you now are. It is then that the adept turns his face downwards, changes his formula from solve to coagula. His progress on the upward path now corresponds exactly with his progress on the downward path; he can only save himself by saving others, for if it were not so he would be hardly better than he who shuts himself in his black tower of illusion, the Brother of the Left Hand, the Klingsor of ìParsifal.î"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN PORTALS 101 58.

Never again must the Adept be deceived by his impressions, though there is that part of him which suffers. 59.

In other words, ìSoulî means Neschamah, and it is important for Neschamah to fix its attention on Chiah, rather than on Ruach. 67. Beware of change! For change is thy great foe. This change will fight thee off, and throw thee back, out of the Path thou treadest, deep into viscous swamps of doubt. The only difficulty in this verse is the word ìchange.î People who are meditating often get thrown off by the circumstances of their lives, and these circumstances must be controlled absolutely. It should, however, also be taken to refer to any change in oneís methods of meditation. You should make up your mind thoroughly to a given scheme of action, and be bound by it.

Prepare, and be forewarned in time. If thou hast tried and failed, O dauntless fighter, yet lose not courage: fight on and to the charge return again, and yet again. Verse 68 confirms our interpretation of these verses. 69. The fearless warrior, his precious life-blood oozing from his wide and gaping wounds, will still attack the foe, drive him from out his stronghold, vanquish him, ere he himself expires. Act then, all ye who fail and suffer, act like him; and from the stronghold of your Soul, chase all your foes awayóambition, anger, hatred, eíen to the shadow of desireówhen even you have failed . . . 70.

One remark in this connection may be useful: ìA watched pot never boils.î The student must practice complete detachmentómust reach the stage when he does not care twopence whether he attains or not, while at the same time he pursues eagerly the Path of attainment.

Ultimately the sacred lance is brought back into the Hall where is the Grail, and there, at the right moment, not moved by desire, not seduced by cunning Kundry, but of his own nature, the sacrifice may be accomplished. So, as previously explained, it is important not to keep on worrying about oneís progress; otherwise all the concen-tration is lost, and a mood of irritability rises, work is given up, and the student becomes angry with his Teacher. His Mind-Soul becomes as a mad elephant that rages in the jungle. He may even obtain the Vision of the Demon Crowley.

It is my daily prayer that I may be spared to write a complete commentary on the extremely mystical works of the Rev. C. L. Dodgson.

There is no longer any struggle, there is but the golden fire within the alabaster vase, and thou art that vase. Mate and female are again interchanged. Above Chiah and Neschamah is Jechidah, and in the lower aspect of that, one has again become the receptacle of the Infinite, not that which penetrates the Infinite. There are two formulÊ of making two things one. The active formula is that of the arrow piercing the rainbow, the Cross erected upon the Hill of Golgotha, and so on.

It cannot be too clearly understood that these things are altogether different. Blavatskyís attempt to mix up Hinduism and Buddhism is productive of constant friction. The first Path in Dhy‚na has nothing whatever to do with being a Srot„patti. It is perfectly clear that you could be Master of the eight Jhanas with no more hope of becoming a Srotapatti than a Pwe-dancer. However, this is an extremely poetical description of what happens on the seventh Path. You must notice that there is a certain amount of confusion between the Paths and the Portals at the end of them. Apparently one does not reach the seventh Gate till the end of the treatise. ìA Master of the Dayî is said to refer to the Manvantara, but it is also an obvious phrase where day is equivalent to Sun. 75. He standeth now like a white pillar to the west, upon whose face the rising Sun of thought eternal poureth forth its first most glorious waves. His mind, like a becalmed and boundless ocean, spreadeth out in shore less space. He holdeth life and death in his strong hand. It is interesting to notice that he is still in the West. This is the penultimate stage. He is really now practically iden-tical with Mayan himself. He has met and conquered the maker of illusion, become one with him, and his difficulty will then be so to complete that work, that it shall be centred on itself, and leave no seed that may subsequently germinate and destroy all that has been accomplished."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 108 76. Yea, he is mighty. The living power made free in him, that power which is HIMSELF, can raise the tabernacle of illusion high above the gods, above great Brahm‚ and Indra. Now he shall surely reach his great reward! The temptation at this point is to create an Universe. He is able: the necessity of so doing is strong within Him, and He may perhaps even imagine that He can make one which shall be free from the Three Characteristics. Evelyn Hallóan early love of mineóused to say: ìGod Almightyóor words to that effectóhas no conscienceî; and in the tremendous state of mind in which He is, a state of Cosmic priapism, He may very likely see red, care nothing for what may result to Himself or His victim, and, violently projecting Himself on the Ak‚sa, may fertilize it, and the Universe begin once more. In Liber I it seems as if this must be done, as if it were part of the Work, and Liber Legis, if I understand it aught, would inculcate the same. For to US the Three Charac-teristics and the Four Noble Truths are liesóthe laws of Illusion. Ours is the Palace of the Grail, not Klingsorís Castle. 77.

This whole passage will be found in much clearer language in Liber I, The Equinox, Vol. I, no. 7. 78. Nay, O thou candidate for Natureís hidden lore!

He is the creative force, while the Master is merely the receptive. But in these verses 78, 79, 80, it might be very easily supposed that it was merely a recapitulation of the former remarks, and I am inclined to think that there is a certain amount of confusion in the mind of the Author between these two grades. She attained only the lower. But careful study of these verses will incline the reader to perceive that it is a new creation which is here spoken of, not a mere amelioration. The only really difficult verse on this interpretation is 86. There is a lot of sham sentiment in this verse. It gives an entirely false picture of the Adept, who does not whine, who does not play Pecksniff. ALL this business about protecting man from far greater misery and sorrow is absurd. For example, in one passage H. P. B. explains that the lowest hell is a man-bearing Planet. There is a certain amount of melancholia with delusions of persecution about this verse. Natural, perhaps, to one who was betrayed and robbed by Vittoria Cremers? 79. Wouldíst thou thus dam the waters born on Sumeru? Shalt thou divert the stream for thine own sake, or send it back to its prime source along the crests of cycles? It is here seen that the ideal proposed by the Author is by no means rest or immobility.

Perdurabo. You can see it in Liber 418, where, as soon as a certain stage is reached, the great curse turns into an ineffable blessing. In The Book of Lies, too, the same idea is stated again and again, with repetition only unwearying because of the beauty and variety of the form. ìEverything is sorrow,î says the Buddha. Quite so, to begin with. We analyze the things we deem least sorrow, and find that by taking a long enough period, or a short enough period, we can prove them to be the most exquisite agony. Such is the attempt of all Buddhist writers, and their even feebler Western imitators. But once the secret of the universe is found, then everything is joy. The proposition is quite as universal. 80. If thou wouldíst have that stream of hard-earníd knowledge, of Wisdom heaven-.born, remain sweet running waters, thou shouldíst not leave it to become a stagnant pond. Here we have the same thesis developed with unex-pected force. So far from the Path being repose, the slightest slackening turns it stagnant. 81. Know, if of Amit‚bha, the ìBoundless Age,î thou wouldíst become co-worker, then must thou shed the light acquired, like to the Bodhisattvas twain, upon the span of alt three worlds. The same doctrine is still further detailed, but I cannot give the authority by which Blavatsky speaks of Kwan-shiyin as a Bodhisattva. It will become abundantly evident in the comment to verse 97 that Blavatsky had not the remotest idea as to what a Bodhisattva was and is.

You have acquired the supreme creative force. You are the Word, and it must be spoken (verse 83). There is a good deal of anticlimax in verse 83, and a peculiarly unnecessary split infinitive. Blavatskyís difficulty seems to have been that although she is always talking of the advance of the good Narjol, he never seems to advance in point of view. Now, on the threshold of the last Path, he is still an ordinary person with vague visionary yearnings! It is true that He wishes the unity of all that lives, complete harmony in the parts, and perfect light in the whole. It is also true that He may spend a great deal of time in killing or otherwise instructing men, but He has not got at all the old conception. The ordinary Buddhist is quite unable to see anything but details. Bhikkhu ¿nanda Metteyya once refused to undertake the superintendence of a coconut plantation, because he found that he would have to give orders for the destruction of vermin. But (with the best feeling in the world) he had to eat rice, and the people who cultivated the rice had to destroy a lot of vermin too. One cannot escape respon-sibility in this vicarious way. It is peculiarly silly, because the whole point of Buddhaís position is that there is no escape.

Is stupid, unseeing selfishness so firmly fixed in the nature of man that even at this height he still laments? Do not believe it. It is interesting here to note the view taken by Him who has actually attained the Grade of Magus. He says: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. It may be those three perfections of my sambhogkaya robe, but the fact is that one has reached a stage when the Path becomes almost meaningless. The illusion of Sorrow has been exposed so ruthlessly that one can hardly realize that one, or anyone else, can ever have been in such a silly muddle. It seems so perfectly natural that everything should be just as it is, and so right, that one is quite startled if one contemplates the nature of oneís Star, which led one into these ìgrave paths.î The only ìwrongî is the thinking about anything at all; this is of course the old ìThought is evilî on a higher plane.

On Sowanís Path, O Srot‚patti, thou art secure. Aye, on that M‚rga, where nought but darkness meets the weary pilgrim, where torn by thorns the hands drip blood, the feet are cut by sharp unyielding flints, and M‚ra wields his strongest armsóthere lies a great reward immediately beyond. It is not at all clear to what stage of the Path this refers. In verse 91 it appears to refer to the Dhyana Path, but the Dhyana Path has been described in entirely different terms in verses 71 to 73, and it is certainly a quite bad description of the condition of Srot‚patti. I think the tragic note is struck for effect. Damn all these tortures and rewards! Has the Narjol no manhood at all? 90. Calm and unmoved the Pilgrim glideth up the stream that to Nirv‚na leads. He knoweth that the more his feet will bleed, the whiter will himself be washed. He knoweth well that after seven short and fleeting births Nirv‚na will be his. Here is again a totally un-Buddhistic description. It appears to me rather a paraphrase of the well-known Sweeping through the gates of the New Jerusalem, Washed in the Blood of the Lamb. 91.

There Klesha is destroyed for ever, Tanh‚ís roots torn out. But stay, Disciple . . . Yet, one word. Canst thou destroy divine COMPASSION? Compassion is no attribute. It is the Law of LAWSóeternal Harmony, Alayaís SELF; a shoreless universal essence, the light of everlasting Right, and fitness of all things, the law of love eternal. Here again is apparently a serious difficulty. The idea of Klesha, here identified with Love of worldly enjoyment, seems to put one back almost before the beginning. Is it now only that the almost-Arhat no longer wants to go to the theatre? It must not be interpreted in this low sense. At the same time, it is difficult to discover a sense high enough to fit the passage. With Tanh‚ it is easier to find a meaning, for Madame seems to identify Tanh‚ with the creative force of which we have spoken. But this is of course incompatible with the Buddhist teaching on the subject. Tanh‚ is properly defined as the hunger of the individual for continuous personal existence, either in a material or a spiritual sense. With regard to the rest of the verse, it certainly reads as if yet again Blavatsky had taken the sword to a Gordian knot. By saying that Compassion is no attribute she is merely asserting what is evidently not true, and she therefore defines it in a peculiar way, and I am afraid that she does so in a somewhat misleading manner.

This verse throws a little further light upon its pre-decessor. COMPASSION is really a certain Chinese figure whose names are numerous. One of them is BAPHOMET. 95. Such is the Arya Path, Path of the Buddhas of perfection. This closes the subject. 96. Withal, what mean the sacred scrolls which make thee say? ìOm!

But of course in practice the term is confined to these special incarnations of the only Buddha of whom we have any such record. It is, therefore, ridiculous to place Srot‚patti as a Soul of inferior grade to Bodhisattva. Buddha did not become a Srot‚patti until seven incarnations before he attained to Buddhahood. The last part of the verse and the long note (of which we quote the gist) are nonsense.
