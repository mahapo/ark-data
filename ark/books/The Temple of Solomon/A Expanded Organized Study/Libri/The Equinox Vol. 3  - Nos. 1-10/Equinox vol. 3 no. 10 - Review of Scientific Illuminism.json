Unlike most spiritual teachers, Crowley was worldly­wise as well asunworldly­wise, conversant with the work of the artists, writers, scientists and philosopherswho defined his times. He accordingly used The Equinox, which he subtitled \"The Journal ofScientific Illuminism,\" to publish reviews and study guides, as well as individual works thathave since become standard references. A poet in his own right, he maintained that initiationfinds tangible expression in creative genius, and so issued the finest literature and poetrypossible. This formed the editorial subtext of the original Equinox, and in that spirit we issuethis new number. Successive generations of artists, writers, poets, filmmakers, dramatists,scientists and philosophers have contributed much to the birth of what we call Thelemicculture. Magick and the arts share the willingness to explore new modes of perception andexpression, to experiment with consciousness itself, and communicate even if a newvocabulary is called for. This issue features both contemporary poetry and cinema (the poetryof light) that demonstrate this.The poets have always been with us, although we (for our part) have not always fullyreciprocated­­after being introduced to Allen Ginsberg in the 1950's, my predecessor FraterSaturnus X° reportedly asked that ``beatniks'' not be brought around.

But I am reminded of Robert Kelly's scribes & scholars of the College of the HolySpirit, resting from their carnival appearances or conning the sermons they will whisper, oholy poison, in the ears of sleeping dominies.

The O.T.O. is a manifold organization with a complex historyand philosophy, rich in written, oral and ritual tradition. It is also the Aleister Crowley Estate,responsible for preserving his writings and setting consistent standards for Thelemicscholarship. These are essentially conservative functions, yet the O.T.O.'s design preservesflexibility and adaptability, without which \"Thelemic Order\" would be a contradiction interms. While it has never been necessary to join the O.T.O. to be a Thelemite, it is central tothe Order's \"experimental design\" that being a Thelemite never becomes a bar tomembership. In this important sense, the O.T.O. is a crucible for the development of thesocial models necessary to a Thelemic culture, as opposed to Thelemic cult.My predecessor as head of the O.T.O., Caliph Hymenaeus Alpha 777 X°, rescued theO.T.O. from the brink of extinction. Only a decade ago the survival of the Order was inquestion, but as the leader of a handful of survivors from the Crowley era who had tended theflame for over forty years, Hymenaeus Alpha fanned it into life. Educated in political scienceand a management analyst by profession, he also successfully addressed the greatest long­term threat to the Order: the \"cult\" tendency in Thelema, manifesting as extremeconservativism on the one hand, and anarchic radicalism on the other.The \"conservative\" wing­­Marcelo Motta and his Society Ordo Templi Orientis (S.O.T.O.)­­evinced a fanatical elitism that laid claim to exclusive representation of Thelema in all itsforms. After tolerating repeated attacks from this group in their apocryphal Equinox \"VolumeFive,\" Hymenaeus Alpha filed suit in Federal Court and won a clear­cut victory­­not for theO.T.O. alone, but also indirectly for many others who were abused in, or simply confused by,the offending works.The \"anarchic\" wing's development was spurred by the writings of Mr. Kenneth Grant,whose excellent book The Magical Revival indeed contributed to a genuine revival in theearly 1970's. In subsequent works, Mr. Grant (who was expelled from the O.T.O. in the mid­1950's) claimed to be Outer Head of the O.T.O., and proceeded to organize an \"O.T.O.\"with complete disregard for the intent of Crowley and the original founders. Grant was, forexample, extremely critical of the business aspects of the O.T.O., which are clearly a part ofthe original charter. Hymenaeus Alpha met this trend by simple example­­he established areputation as a tolerant monarch, and thereby gave the lie to anarchy. We count some of Mr.Grant's most enthusiastic readers among our members.First published in England beginning in 1909 EV, The Equinox served as the Official Organof the A.∙.A.∙.. Crowley issued a new number on each equinox, and the ten numbers ofVolume I are now a standard reference­library set. After Crowley's induction into the OrdoTempli Orientis in 1913 EV The Equinox became an Official Organ of the O.T.O. as well,beginning with Volume I(10). Although they shared the same journal for several numbers,the A.∙.A.∙.. and the O.T.O. were and are distinct organizations. They are so often confusedthat Saturnus X° asked Crowley for an official statement on the subject:The difference between the A.∙.A.∙. and the O.T.O. is very clear and simple. The A.∙.A.∙. is asempiternal institution, and entirely secret. There is no communication between its members."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Theoretically, a member knows only the superior who introduced him, and any person whomhe himself has introduced. The Order is run on purely spiritual lines.The objective of membership is also entirely simple. The first objective is the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The next objective, omitting considerations for thepresent of the 6°=5 and 7°=4 degrees, is the crossing of the Abyss, and the attainment ofmastership of the Temple. This is described very fully especially in Liber 418. Much less iswritten about the 5°=6 degree, i.e. the Knowledge and Conversation, because it is too secretand individual. It is impossible to lay down conditions, or to describe the experiences indetail.The O.T.O. has nothing to do with this, except that The Book of the Law and the Word of theAeon are essential principles of membership. In all other respects, it stands by itself as a bodysimilar to Freemasonry, but involving acceptance of a social and economic system which isintended to put the world on its feet. There is also, of course, the secret of the IX° which is tosay, the weapon which they may use to further these purposes.To show you the difference, Theodor Reuss was Supreme Head of the O.T.O., but was noteven a probationer of the A.∙.A.∙..Crowley spent the last of his inheritance in releasing Volume I, after which its publishinghistory becomes erratic­­The Equinox had the first of many interruptions in 1913 EV.Crowley termed this first hiatus Volume II, \"a volume of silence,\" in accord with an A.∙.A.∙..rule of alternating 5­year periods of speech and silence.Volume III was issued by the O.T.O. under four administrations of the Order over 67 years.(The \"5­year\" rule was disregarded, presumably since it pertained to the A.∙.A.∙..) Volume IIIhas a complicated bibliography whose twists and turns are a bell­wether of the Order'sfortunes. The first number of Volume III to appear was the well­known \"blue\" Equinox,issued from Detroit in 1919 EV. Crowley outlined the proposed contents of the remainder ofVolume III in this number, but Volume III(2) never appeared (although it reached galley­proofs and was included in the series as if issued). In subsequent numbers of Volume III TheEquinox came to assume the character of a series of occasional monographs. Number 3reached galley­proofs in 1927 EV, but was delayed until 1936 EV when it appeared in partialform as The Equinox of the Gods (actually part one of four parts of Book Four Part Four, tohave included the Commentary to The Book of the Law). Number 4 appeared in 1938 EV asEight Lectures on Yoga. Number 5 was announced in 1938 EV as the Tao Teh King butactually appeared in 1944 EV as The Book of Thoth. Number 6, Liber Aleph, was close toproduction at Crowley's death in 1947 EV but appeared posthumously in 1962 EV. (Its\"publication fund\"­­contributions from the American O.T.O.­­was found untouched under hisdeathbed.) This was followed by the Shih Yi (Yi King) (Number 7) in 1971 EV, the Tao TehKing (Number 8) in 1975 EV and The Holy Books of Thelema (Number 9) in 1983 EV.

The sign Leo being in theascendant at his nativity, he is here called by that name.The family of Leo was both distinguished and prosperous; he received the best educationavailable in the land of his birth.In the beginning of the third year (1897 E.V.) of his studies at the University, he underwentwhat may be called the Trance of Sorrow. That is, he perceived the vanity of all earthlyambition.This conviction so took hold of him that he renounced, then and there, his career, despite thebrilliant promise which it would otherwise have afforded, and resolved firmly to devotehimself without reserve to the Great Work. By this he meant, to find a medium in which effortmight secure success immune to the assaults of Time and other conditions of human existence.For his mind was yet young and untaught.His first reading of the literature of Alchemy and kindred subjects, to which he now resorted,convinced him of the existence of a Secret Body of Initiates competent to aid him in hisresearch.He sent forth instinctively an intense current of Will, calling upon the Masters in such aSanctuary to come to his assistance.The call was immediately heard. Indeed, at the moment of its utterance (Easter 1898 E.V.) hewas in the closest possible association with one of them, albeit this man so concealed his truenature that Leo did not discover the truth until three years later, when his need evoked the aidof this Master.In the summer of 1898 E.V., Leo travelling in the mountains of Europe, fell in with a manwho proved to be an eager student of Alchemy. He pursued this acquaintance, and exactedfrom him a promise to introduce him to a more advanced adept. The latter him introduced himinto that organization, so that he obtained his first initiation on November 18, 1898 E.V."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In this Society Leo made rapid progress and attained early in 1899 E.V. the highest gradewhich its Chief was permitted to give. Within one or two months of that event that Chief, whowas but the visible representative of Secret Chiefs, committed so grave a blunder, as aculmination of a series of blunders, that he lost Their confidence. The Outer Order whichdepended on him dissolved at once in confusion.Unfamiliar with the Inner workings of the Order, and realizing his own inability to judge amatter beyond his knowledge, Leo remained openly loyal to the fallen Head; but as he feltinstinctively that he could not learn any more from this source, he undertook a journey of threeyears to the remotest parts of the earth, searching incessantly for further enlightenment.The Masters, who were watching him, sent out messengers from time to time, in order to teachhim in many secret paths of enlightenment. In all these he attained the greatest success; it canbe said that at his return to the country of his birth in 1903 E.V. he was the most advancedadept (as distinguished from a Master) in the world. And yet he was so far from accepting hisprogress with satisfaction, that he formally and finally gave up the Great Work asinsignificant.And this too was the Plan of the Masters.Having surrendered his True Will so far that he had married (August 1903 E.V.) and settleddown to the life of an ordinary man, having built up a fortress of resentment against allspiritual assault, Leo had become a fit instrument to carry out the inscrutable designs of theMasters.At the end of a sporting expedition in Asia he stayed in Cairo for the Season with his youngwife, a woman of neither instinct for, nor interest in, any but the most frivolous of worldlyamusements.Now the Masters, the Secret Chiefs of the Order to which he owed his first initiation, are thedirectors of the spiritual destinies of this planet. These men chose this woman (of all women)to carry Their Will to the Aspirant who had renounced his aspiration.Leo received their message with quiet mockery: he agreed to carry out the instructionsconveyed by his wife in a spirit of irony, resolved to demonstrate to her the absurdity of herclaim to be in communication with a praeter­human Intelligence.The principal of these instructions was to shut himself up in a certain room of his house forone hour daily for three days (April 8 ­ 10, 1904 E.V.) that he might write what should thenbe given to him.He was astonished beyond measure when, on the stroke of the appointed hour, he heard theaccents of a human voice, speaking in English (a language he understood sufficiently for thepurpose) and continuing until the sixty minutes had exactly passed.This occurred on the two succeeding days: the result is the Manuscript known as Liber AL velLegis; or The Book of the Law."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Other communications were made at about this period by the Secret Chiefs. They provedbeyond all possibility of doubt to Leo, a firm sceptic accustomed to mathematical andscientific methods of criticism, their own existence, and their possession of power andknowledge far exceeding anything hereto conceived as human.This proof, at least the major part of it, a portion ample to establish the above thesis, is extant;it is contained implicitly in the MS. of Liber AL itself, and is accessible at any time to anyAspirant to the Secret Wisdom.It is in this book, also, that the Secret Chiefs conferred upon Leo the title of TO MEGAVHRION, with its corresponding number DCLXVI; as the Master Therion, therefore, let himhenceforth be denoted. (It was not for many years that he became fit to assume this office in itsfull scope; he did so on October 1915 E.V.)They instructed him definitely to take over the rule and governance of the Order, assuming theplace vacant by the fall of the original Chief; and to publish openly the whole of the secretknowledge in his possession in such a form that it might survive the general catastrophe to thewhole of civilization, which They saw was imminent. (The war of 1914 ­18 is to be regardedas the preliminary skirmish of this vast world­conflict.)The effect of this upon Therion was to bring out two contradictory elements in his character.On the one hand: he was absolutely convinced of the truth of the claims of the Secret Chiefs,of their praeter­human attainments, and of Their right and power to direct the course of eventsupon this planet. Moreover he was bound to Them by his original oath at his first initiation.On the other hand: he was wholly at variance with great bulk of philosophy and ethics setforth in Liber AL. He was filled, in short, with two conflicting currents of enthusiasm andresentment.In the upshot, after a mostly contemptuous attempt to carry out formally Their firstinstructions, acting, in such a way as to defeat his own apparent efforts (as if to say, let thembring their own work to fruition, if they can and will), he revolted openly. The experience hadforced him to abandon his attitude of deliberate worldliness, but he did his utmost to follow hisown career upon a Path not Theirs.The next few years saw him engaged in this desperate struggle against Them. Little by littlethey broke his false will. Many were the tortures by which They compelled him to renew hisallegiance: many were the signs by which They manifested Their vigilance and Their virtue.He fought every yard of ground with desperate tenacity; it was no sudden surrender of his, butthe steady compulsion of Their might, that brought him back to the True Path.Now the Secret Chiefs had chosen him as Their representative on earth, as the vehicle of theUtterance. And because he was not yet fitted by full initiation to carry out Their designs, itwas imperative that They should prevent him, even when he consented to execute Theircommands, from making a premature appearance. This was not altogether easy to secure for,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"despite his own determination to abandon his worldly career, he had obtained eminence intwo widely distinct paths of human activity; so that whatever he might choose to set forthwould be certain to receive due attention from the world at large.As wary as he was courageous, as skilful and subtle as he was full of resource, he gave Themno shadow of cause to reproach him; yet They destroyed his love, his hope, and his peace ofmind. They alienated him from every single friend and supporter; he was betrayed again andagain even by those who sought to be most loyal to him, and would have died a thousanddeaths to serve him.They masked him so grotesquely, hideously, obscenely, that it became scarce possible for anyman to penetrate the secret of his true personality.Yet also during this whole time, They led him in divers ways through ordeals more and moreexalted, until They had fixed him at the summit of the Order, in that degree of enlightenmentwhich (or so it is said) is attained by any man in the body not oftener than once in TwoThousand years.The climax of their dealings with him came in the weeks immediately preceding andfollowing the Spring Equinox of 1924 E.V. At this time he lay sick unto death. He wasentirely alone; for They would even permit the presence of those few whom They hadthemselves appointed to aid him in this final initiation. In this last ordeal the earthly part of himwas dissolved in water; the water was vaporized into air; the air was rarified utterly, until hewas free to make the last effort, and to pass into the vast caverns of the Threshold whichguards the Realm of Fire. Now naught human may come through those immensities. So inthat Fire he was consumed wholly, and as pure Spirit alone did he return, little by little, duringthe months that followed, into the body and mind that had perished in that great ordeal ofwhich he can say no more than: I died.But these six months being accomplished, a certain Virgin came forth at the bidding of theSecret Chiefs, at whose touch he resumed contact with his human life.Her he conveyed swiftly to the Desert of the Sahara, that in silent communion with her Soulhe might become aware of the intimate nature of his Work for the Masters; for she was verilya symbol of the Virgin Bride, whose redemption is the mystery of the Perpetuation of theGodhead.Now when they had taken ship and sailed even to the midst of the Mediterranean Sea, therecame to him once again an impulse from the Secret Chiefs: to write down in the most succinctform possible a statement of his nature and purpose.And this he did do in the manifesto following:TO MANDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"My Term of Office upon the Earth being come in the year of the foundation of theTheosophical Society, I took upon myself, in my turn, the sin of the whole World, that theProphecies might be fulfilled, so that Mankind may take the Next Step from the MagicalFormula of Osiris to that of Horus.And mine Hour being now upon me, I proclaim my Law.The word of the Law is ThelemaGiven in the midst of theMediterranean SeaAn XX, Sol in 3° Libra die Jovisby me TO MEGA VHRION DCLXVILOGOS AIQNOS ThelemaWhoso understandeth may seek.Now of this which is here written; ``I took upon myself, in my turn, the sin of the wholeWorld that the Prophecies might be fulfilled,'' it is to be understood that not only the definitespiritual experiences which determine the fact, but also the whole of his life, his joys, hissufferings, his travels in so many lands, his achievements in so many paths, his mingling withso many types of men and women of so many climes and climates, is, in sum, an universalexperience which has enabled him to fulfil to the uttermost the great Oath taken by him on hisinitiation to the grade of Master of the Temple; as here follows:``I.I, O.M., etc., a member of the Body of God, hereby bind myself on behalf of theWhole Universe, even as we are now physically bound unto the cross of suffering:II.that I will lead a pure life, as a devoted servant of the Order:III.that I will understand all things:IV.that I will love all things:V.that I will perform all things and endure all things:VI.that I will continue in the Knowledge and Conversation of my Holy Guardian Angel:VII.that I will work without attachment:VIII.that I will work in truth:IX.that I will rely only upon myself:X.that I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my Soul.And if I fail herein, may my pyramid be profaned, and the Eye closed to me.''Now therefore this proclamation of this word is the fulfillment of his Oath on his initiation tothe grade of Magus (even as Gautama Buddha uttered the Word ANATTA, Laotze the WordTAO, Dionysus the Word IAO, Mohammed the Word ALLAH, and so for the rest, at the dueinterval each in his place).

Every act that is not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must not be two, but one. Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained above, but also ìunassuaged of purposeî. This strange phrase must give us pause. It may mean that any purpose in the will would damp it; clearly, the ìlust of resultî is a thing from which it must be delivered. But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read ìwith purpose unassuagedîói.e. with tireless energy. The conception is, therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of staticóand this comes to the same thing in the end. The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover what his will really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this by the practices of Liber Thisharb (see Equinox I, VII, 105) or such others as may from one time to another be appointed. It should now be perfectly simple for everybody to understand the Message of the Master Therion.

Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of Things, thy will part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God.

No matter whether I am writingto my lady or to my butcher, always I begin with these eleven words. Why, how else should Ibegin? What other greeting could be so glad? Look, brother, we are free! Rejoice with me,sister, there is no law beyond Do what thou wilt!III WRITE this for those who have not read our Sacred book, The Book of the Law, or forthose who, reading it, have somehow failed to understand its perfection. For there are manymatters in this Book, and the Glad Tidings are now here, now there, scattered throughout theBook as the Stars are scattered through the field of Night. Rejoice with me, all ye people! Atthe very head of the Book stands the great charter of our godhead: ``Every man and everywoman is a star.'' We are all free, all independent, all shining gloriously, each one a radiantworld. Is not that good tidings?Then comes the first call of the Great Goddess Nuit, Lady of the Starry Heaven, who is alsoMatter in its deepest metaphysical sense, who is the infinite in whom all we live and moveand have our being. Hear Her first summons to us men and women: ``Come forth, o children,under the stars, & take your fill of love! I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours.My joy is to see your joy.'' Later She explains the mystery of sorrow: ``For I am divided forlove's sake, for the chance of union.''``This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy ofdissolution all.''"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"It is shown later how this can be, how death itself is an ecstasy like love, but more intense, thereunion of the soul with its true self.And what are the conditions of this joy, and peace, and glory? Is ours the gloomy asceticismof the Christian, and the Buddhist, and the Hindu? Are we walking in eternal fear lest some``sin'' should cut us off from ``grace''? By no means.``Be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines andwines that foam! Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and withwhom ye will! But always unto me.''This is the only point to bear in mind, that every act must be a ritual, an act of worship, asacrament. Live as the kings and princes, crowned and uncrowned, of this world, havealways lived, as masters always live; but let it not be self­indulgence; make your self­indulgence your religion.When you drink and dance and take delight, you are not being ``immoral,'' you are not``risking your immortal soul''; you are fulfilling the precepts of our holy religion­­providedonly that you remember to regard your actions in this light. Do not lower yourself and destroyand cheapen your pleasure by leaving out the supreme joy, the consciousness of the Peacethat passeth understanding. Do not embrace mere Marian or Melusine; she is Nuit Herself,specially concentrated and incarnated in a human form to give you infinite love, to bid youtaste even on earth the Elixir of Immortality. ``But ecstasy be thine and joy of earth: ever Tome! To me!''Again She speaks: ``Love is the law, love under will.'' Keep pure your highest ideal; striveever toward it without allowing aught to stoÿ you or turn you aside, even as a star sweepsupon its incalculable and infinite course of glory, and all is Love. The Law of your beingbecomes Light, Life, Love and Liberty. All is peace, all is harmony and beauty, all is joy.For hear, how gracious is the Goddess; ``I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, notfaith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught insacrifice.''Is this not better than the death­in­life of the slaves of the Slave­ Gods, as they go oppressedby consciousness of ``sin,'' wearily seeking or simulating wearisome and tedious ``virtues''?With such, we who have accepted the Law of Thelema have nothing to do. We have heardthe Voice of the Star­Goddess: ``I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled orvoluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desireyou. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!'' And thusShe ends:``Sing the rapturous love­song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink tome, for I love you! I love you! I am the blue­ lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the nakedbrilliance of the voluptuous night­sky. To me! To me!'' And with these words ``The"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Manifestation of Nuit is at an end.''IIIIN THE NEXT CHAPTER of our book is given the word of Hadit, who is the complementof Nuit. He is eternal energy, the Infinite Motion of Things, the central core of all being. Themanifested Universe comes from the marriage of Nuit and Hadit; without this could no thingbe. This eternal, this perpetual marriage­feast is then the nature of things themselves; andtherefore everything that is, is a crystallization of divine ecstasy.Hadit tells us of Himiself: ``I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core ofevery star.'' He is then your own inmost divine self; it is you, and not another, who are lost inthe constant rapture of the embraces of Infinite Beauty. A little further on He speaks of us:``We are not for the poor and the sad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk.''``Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shall rejoice, our chosen: whosorroweth is not of us.''``Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.'' Later,concerning death, He says: ``Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verilythou shalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the King dissolve, heshall remain in pure ecstasy for ever.'' When you know that, what is left but delight? Andhow are we to live meanwhile?``It is a lie, this folly against self.'' {...} ``Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense andrapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.''Again and again, in words like these, He sees the expansion and the develoÿment of the soulthrough joy.Here is the Calendar of our Church: ``But ye, o my people, rise up & awake! Let the ritualsbe rightly performed with joy & beauty!'' Remember that all acts of love and pleasure arerituals, must be rituals. ``There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times. A feast forthe first night of the Prophet and his Bride! A feast for the three days of the writing of theBook of the Law. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet­­secret, o Prophet! A feastfor the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods. A feast for fire and a feastfor water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death! A feast every day in your hearts in thejoy of my rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight! Aye!feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is the dissolution, and eternal ecstasy in thekisses of Nu.'' It all depends on your own acceptance of this new law, and you are not askedto believe anything, to accept a string of foolish fables beneath the intellectual level of aBushman and the moral level of a drug­fiend. All you have to do is to be yourself, to do yourwill, and to rejoice.``Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?'' He says again: ``Where I am, theseare not.'' There is much more of the same kind; enough has been quoted already to make all"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"clear. But there is a further injunction. ``Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear morejoy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture!

Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine­­and doubt it not, an if thou artever joyous!­­death is the crown of all.''Lift yourselves up, my brothers and sisters of the earth! Put beneath your feet all fears, allqualms, all hesitancies! Lift yourselves up! Come forth, free and joyous, by night and day, todo your will; for ``There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.'' Lift yourselves up! Walk forthwith us in Light and Life and Love and Liberty, taking our pleasure as Kings and Queens inHeaven and on Earth.The sun is arisen; the spectre of the ages has been put to flight. ``The word of Sin isRestriction,'' or as it has been otherwise said on this text: That is Sin, to hold thine holy spiritin!Go on, go on in thy might; and let no man make thee afraid.Love is the law, love under will."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Liber CCC {Book 300} Khabs am Pekht This Epistle is important in that it helps place the work of the O.T.O. as a temporal organization in perspective. Addressed by The Master Therion to his magical Son Frater V.I.O. 8°=3 (Parzival X° O.T.O.), it has a special relevance to modern times. It first appeared in The Equinox I(3) (Detroit: Universal, 1919). Most of the quotations are from Liber Legis--The Book of the Law.--H.B. AN EPISTLE OF THERION 9°=2, A MAGUS OF A.·.A.·. TO HIS SON, BEING AN INSTRUCTION IN A MATTER OF ALL IMPORTANCE, TO WIT, THE MEANS TO BE TAKEN TO EXTEND THE DOMINION OF THE LAW OF THELEMA THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD. Son, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. FIRSTLY, let thine attention be directed to this planet, how the Aeon of Horus is made manifest by the Universal War. This is the first great and direct result of the Equinox of the Gods, and is the preparation of the hearts of men for the reception of the Law. Let Us remind you that this is a magical formula of cosmic scope, and that it is given in exact detail in the legend of the Golden Fleece. Jason, who in this story represents the Beast, first fits out a ship guided by Wisdom or Athena, and this is his aspiration to the Great Work. Accompanied by many heroes, he comes to the place of the Fleece, but they can do nothing until Medea, the Scarlet Woman, puts into his hands a posset ``drugged with somnolence, Sleepy with poppy and white hellebore'' for the dragon. Then Jason is able to subdue the bulls, sacred to Osiris, and symbolical of his Aeon and of the Magical Formula of Self-Sacrifice. With these he plows the field of the world, and sows therein ``the dreadful teeth of woe, Cadmean Stock of Thebes' old misery,'' which refers to a certain magical formula announced by The Beast that is familiar unto thee, but unsuited to the profane, and therefore not further in this place indicated. From this seed armed men sprung to life; but instead of attacking Him, ``mutual madness strikes The warriors witless, and fierce wrath invades Their hearts of fury, and with arms engaged, They fell upon each other silently, And slew, and slew.'' Now then, the Dragon being asleep, we may step quietly past him, and ``rending the branches of that wizard Oak, With a strong grasp tear down the Fleece of Gold.'' Let us only remember not to repeat the error of Jason, and defy Ares, who is Horus in his warrior mood, that guardeth it, lest He strike us also with madness. Nay! but to the glory of Ra-Hoor-Khuit and the establishment of His perfect kingdom let all be done! Now, O my son, thou knowest that it is Our will to establish this Work, accomplishing fully that which We are commanded in The Book of the Law, ``Help me, O warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the children of men!''--and it is Thy will, manifesting as thou hast done in the Sphere of Malkuth the material world, to do this same thing in an even more immediate and practical way than would naturally appeal to one whose manifestation is in the Heaven of Jupiter. So therefore We now answer Thy filial petition that asketh good counsel of Us as to the means to be taken to extend the Law of Thelema throughout the whole world."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Direct therefore now most closely thine attention to The Book of the Law itself. In It we find an absolute rule of life, and clear instruction in every emergency that may befall. What then are Its own directions for the fructification of That Ineffable Seed? Note, pray thee, the confidence with which we may proceed. ‘ ‘ They shall gather my children into their fold; they shall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men.’’ They ‘ shall’; there is no doubt. Therefore doubt not, but strike with all thy strength. Note also, pray thee, this word: ‘ ‘ The Law is for all.’’ Do not therefore ‘ select suitable persons’ in thy worldly wisdom; preach oÿenly the Law to all men. In Our experience We have found that the most unlikely means have produced the best results; and indeed it is almost the definition of a true Magical Formula that the means should be unsuited, rationally speaking, to the end proposed. Note, pray thee, that We are bound to teach. ``He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.'' This refers, however, as is evident from the context, to the technique of the new Magick, ``the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword.'' Note, pray thee, the instruction in CCXX I:41-n-44, 51, 61, 63 k.t.l. on which We have enlarged in Our tract The Law of Liberty, and in private letters to thee and to others. The open preaching of this Law, and the practice of these precepts, will arouse discussion and animosity, and thus place thee upon a rostrum whence thou mayst speak unto the people. Note, pray thee, this mentor: ``Remember ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but shadows; they pass and are done; but there is that which remains.'' For this doctrine shall comfort many. Also there is this word: ``They shall rejoice, our chosen; who sorroweth is not of us. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.'' Indeed in all ways thou mayest expound the joy of our Law; nay, for thou shalt overflow with the joy thereof, and have no need of words. It would moreover be impertinent and tedious to call again thine attention to all those passages that thou knowest so well. Note, pray thee, that in the matter of direct instruction there is enough. Consider the passage ``Choose ye an island! Fortify it! Dung it about with enginery of war! I will give you a war-engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! This is the Law of the Battle of Conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house.'' The last phrase suggests that the island may be Great Britain, with its Mines and Tanks; and it is notable that a certain brother obligated to A...A... is in the most secret of England's War Councils at this hour. But it is possible that all this instruction refers to some later time when our Law, administered by some such Order as the O.T.O. which concerns itself with temporal affairs, is of weight in the councils of the world, and is challenged by the heathen, and by the followers of the fallen gods and demigods. Note, pray thee, the practical method of overcoming opposition given in CCXX III:23-n-26. But this is not to Our immediate purpose in this epistle. Note, pray thee, the instruction in the 38th and 39th verses of the Third Chapter of The Book of the Law. It must be quoted in full. ``So that thy light is in me; and its red flame is as a sword in my hand to push thy order.'' That is, the God himself is aflame with the Light of The Beast, and will himself push the order, through the fire (perhaps meaning the genius) of The Beast. ``There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters (these are the adorations, as thou hast written) as it is said: The Light is mine; its rays consume Me: I have made a secret door Into the House of Ra and Tum, Of Khephra, and of Ahathoor. I am thy Theban, O Mentu, The prophet Ankh-f-na-khonsu!"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell. Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit! Bid me within thine House to dwell, O winged snake of light, Hadit! Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!’’ In the comment in Equinox I(7) this passage is virtually ignored. It is possible that this ‘ ‘ secret door’’ refers to the four men and four women spoken of later in The Paris Working, or it may mean the child elsewhere predicted, or some secret preparation of the hearts of men. It is difficult to decide on such a point, but we may be sure that the Event will show that the exact wording was so shaded as to prove to us absolute foreknowledge on the part of That Most Holy Angel who uttered the Book. Note, pray thee, further, in verse 39, how the matter proceeds: ‘ ‘ All this’’--L\u0011H. The Book of the Law itself. ‘ ‘ and a book to say how didst come hither’’ L\u0011H. some record such as that in The Temple of Solomon the King. ‘ ‘ And a reproduction of this ink and paper for ever’’ L\u0011H. by some mechanical process, with possibly a sample of paper similar to that employed. ‘ ‘ --for in it is the word secret and not only in the English--’’ Compare CCXX III:47, 73. The secret is still a secret to Us. ‘ ‘ And thy comment upon this the Book of the Law shall be printed beautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by hand;’’ i.e. explain the text ‘ ‘ lest there be folly’’ as it says above, CCXX I:36. ‘ ‘ And to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to drink at them, it is the Law to give. Then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is no odds. Do this quickly!’’ From this it is evident that a volume must be prepared as signified-- Part IV of Book 4 was intended to fulfil this purpose--and that this book must be distributed widely, in fact to every one with whom one comes into social relations. We are not to add to this gift by preaching and the like. They can take it or leave it. Note, pray thee, verse 41 of this chapter: ‘ ‘ Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house; all must be done well and with business way.’’ This is very clear instruction indeed. There is to be a modern centralized business organization at the Kaaba--which, We think, does not mean Boleskine, but any convenient headquarters. Note, pray thee, in verse 42 of this chapter the injunction: ‘ ‘ Success is thy proof: argue not; convert not; talk not overmuch.’’ This is not any bar to an explanation of the Law. We may aid men to strike off their own fetters; but those who prefer slavery must be allowed to do so. ‘ ‘ The slaves shall serve.’’ The excellence of the Law must be showed by its results upon those who accept it. When men see us as the hermits of Hadit described in CCXX II:24, they will determine to emulate our joy."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Note, pray thee, the whole implication of the chapter that sooner or later we are to break the power of the slaves of the slave-gods by actual fighting. Ultimately, Freedom must rely upon the sword. It is impossible to treat in this epistle of the vast problems involved in this question; and they must be decided in accordance with the Law by those in authority in the Order when the time comes. Thou wilt note that We have written unto thee more as a member of the O.T.O., than in thy capacity as of the A.·.A.·., for the former organization is co-ordinate and practical, and concerns itself with material things. But remember this clearly, that the Law cometh from the A.·.A.·., not from the O.T.O. This Order is but the first of the great religious bodies to accept this Law officially, and its whole Ritual has been revised and reconstituted in accordance with this decision. Now then, leaving The Book of the Law, note, pray thee, the following additional suggestions for extending the Dominion of the Law of Thelema throughout the whole world. 1. All those who have accepted the Law should announce the same in daily intercourse. ``Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law'' shall be the invariable form of greeting. These words, especially in the case of strangers, should be pronounced in a clear, firm, and articulate voice, with the eyes frankly fixed upon the bearer. If the other be of us, let him reply ``Love is the law, love under will.'' The latter sentence shall also be used as the greeting of farewell. In writing, wherever greeting is usual, it should be as above, opening ``Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.'', and closing ``Love is the law, love under will.'' 2. Social gatherings should be held as often as is convenient, and there the Law should be read and explained. 3. The special tracts written by Us, or authorized by Us, should be distributed to all persons with whom those who have accepted the Law may be in contact. 4. Pending the establishment of other Universities and Schools of Thelema, scholarships and readerships and such should be provided in existing Schools and Universities, so as to secure the general study of Our writings, and those authorized by Us as pertaining to the New Aeon. 5. All children and young people, although they may not be able to understand the more exalted heavens of our horoscope, may always be taught to rule their lives in accordance with the Law. No efforts should be spared to bring them to this emancipation. The misery caused to children by the operation of the law of the slave-gods was, one may say, the primum mobile of Our first aspiration to overthrow the Old Law. 6. By all manner of means shall all strive constantly to increase the power and freedom of the Headquarters of the O.T.O.; for thereby will come efficiency in the promulgation of the Law. Specific instructions for the extension of the O.T.O. are given in another epistle. Constant practice of these recommendations will develop skill in him or her that practiseth, so that new ideas and plans will be evolved continually. Furthermore, it is right that each and every one bind himself with an Oath Magical that he may thus make Freedom perfect, even by a bond, as in Liber III it is duly written. Amen. Now, son, note, pray thee, in what house We write these words. For it is a little cottage of red and green, by the western side of a great lake, and it is hidden in the woods. Man, therefore, is at odds with Wood and Water; and being a magician bethinketh Himself to take one of these enemies, Wood, which is both the effect and the cause of that excess of Water, and compel it to fight for Him against the other. What then maketh He? Why, He taketh unto himself Iron of Mars, an Axe and a Saw and a Wedge and a Knife, and He divideth Wood therewith against himself, hewing him into many small pieces, so that he hath no longer any strength against His will. Good; then taketh He the Fire of our Father the Sun, and setteth it directly in battle array against that Water by His army"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"of Wood that he hath conquered and drilled, building it up into a phalanx like unto a Cone, that is the noblest of all solid figures, being the Image of the Holy Phallus Itself, and combined in himself the Right Line and the Circle. Thus, son, dealeth He; and the Fire kindleth the Wood, and the heat thereof driveth the Water afar off. Yet this Water is a cunning adversary, and He strengthened Wood against Fire by impregnating him with much of his own substance, as it were by spies in the citadel of any ally that is not wholly trusted. Now then therefore what must the Magician do? He must first expel utterly Water from Wood by an invocation of the Fire of the Sun our Father. That is to say, without the inspiration of the Most High and Holy One even We ourselves could do nothing at all. Then, son, beginneth the Magician to set His Fire to the little dry Wood, and that enkindleth the Wood of middle size, and when that blazeth brightly, at the last the great logs, through they be utterly green, are nevertheless enkindled. Now, son, hearken unto this Our reproof, and lend the ear of thine understanding unto the parable of this Magick. We have for the whole Beginning of Our Work, praise be eternally unto His Holy Name, the Fire of our Father the Sun. The inspiration is ours, and ours is the Law of Thelema that shall set the world ablaze. And We have many small dry sticks, that kindle quickly and burn through quickly, leaving the larger Wood unlit. And the great logs, the masses of humanity, are always with us. But our edged need is of those middle fagots that on the one hand are readily kindled by the small Wood, and on the other endure until the great logs blaze. (Behold how sad a thing it is, quoth the Ape of Thoth, for one to be so holy that he cannot chop a tree and cook his food without preparing upon it a long and tedious Morality!) Let this epistle be copied and circulated among all those that have accepted the Law of Thelema. Receive now Our paternal benediction: the Benediction of the All-Begetter be upon thee.

It is I, not another, that willeth your whole Freedom, and the arising within you of full Knowledge and Power. Behold! the Kingdom of God is within you, even as the Sun standeth eternal in the heavens, equal at midnight and at noon. He riseth not: he setteth not: it is but the shadow of the earth which concealeth him, or the clouds upon her face. Let me then declare unto you this Mystery of the Law, as it hath been made known unto me in divers places, upon the mountains and in the deserts, but also in great cities, which thing I speak for your comfort and good courage. And so be it unto all of you. Know first, that from the Law spring four Rays or Emanations: so that if the Law be the centre of your own being, they must needs fill you with their secret goodness. And these four are Light, Life, Love, and Liberty. By Light shall ye look upon yourselves, and behold All Things that are in Truth One Thing only, whose name hath been called No Thing for a cause which later shall be declared unto you. But the substance of Light is Life, since without Existence and Energy it were naught. By Life therefore are you made yourselves, eternal and incorruptible, flaming forth as suns, self-created and self-supported, each the sole centre of the Universe."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Now by the Light ye beheld, by Love ye feel. There is an ecstacy of pure Knowledge, and another of pure Love. And this Love is the force that uniteth things diverse, for the contemplation in Light of their Oneness. Know that the Universe is not at rest, but in extreme motion whose sum is Rest. And this understanding that Stability is Change, and Change Stability, that Being is Becoming, and Becoming Being, is the Key to the Golden Palace of this Law. Lastly, by Liberty is the power to direct your course according to your Will. For the extent of the Universe is without bounds, and ye are free to make your pleasure as ye will, seeing that the diversity of being is infinite also. For this also is the Joy of the Law, that no two stars are alike, and ye must understand also that this Multiplicity is itself Unity, and without it Unity could not be. And this is an hard saying against Reason: ye shall comprehend, when, rising above Reason, which is but a manipulation of the Mind, ye come to pure Knowledge by direct perception of the Truth. Know also that these four Emanations of the Law flame forth upon all paths: ye shall use them not only in these Highways of the Universe whereof I have written, but in every By-path of your daily life. Love is the law, love under will. ,\u0003\u00032)\u0003/,%(57<\u0003\u0003IT IS OF LIBERTY that I would first write unto you, for except ye be free to act, ye cannot act. Yet all four gifts of the Law must in some degree be exercised, seeing that these four are one. But for the Aspirant that cometh unto the Master, the first need is freedom. The great bond of all bonds is ignorance. How shall a man be free to act if he know not his own purpose? You must therefore first of all discover which star of all the stars you are, your relation to the other stars about you, and your relation to, and identity with, the Whole. In our Holy Books are given sundry means of making this discovery, and each must make it for himself, attaining absolute conviction by direct experience, not merely reasoning and calculating what is probable. And to each will come the knowledge of his finite will, whereby one is a poet, one prophet, one worker in steel, another in jade. But also to each be the knowledge of his infinite Will, his destiny to perform the Great Work, the realization of his True Self. Of this Will let me therefore speak clearly unto all, since it pertaineth unto all. Understand now that in yourselves is a certain discontent. Analyse well its nature: at the end is in every case one conclusion. The ill springs from the belief in two things, the Self and the Not-Self, and the conflict between them. This also is a restriction of the Will. He who is sick is in conflict with his own body: he who is poor is at odds with society: and so for the rest. Ultimately, therefore, the problem is how to destroy this perception of duality, to attain to the apprehension of unity. Now then let us suppose that you have come to the Master, and that He has declared to you the Way of this attainment. What hindereth you? Alas! there is yet much Freedom afar off. Understand clearly this: that if you are sure of your Will, and sure of your means, then any thoughts or actions which are contrary to those means are contrary also to that Will. If therefore the Master should enjoin upon you a Vow of Holy Obedience, compliance is not a surrender of the Will, but a fulfilment thereof."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"For see, what hindereth you? It is either from without or from within, or both. It may be easy for the strong-minded seeker to put his heel upon public opinion, or to tear from his heart the objects which he loves, in a sense: but there will always remain in himself many discordant affections, as also the bond of habit, and these also must he conquer. In our holiest Book it is written: ‘ ‘ Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.’’ Write it also in your heart and in your brain: for this is the key of the whole matter. Here Nature herself be your preacher: for in every phenomenon of force and motion doth she proclaim aloud this truth. Even in so small a matter as driving a nail into a plank, hear this same sermon. Your nail must be hard, smooth, fine-pointed, or it will not move swiftly in the direction willed. Imagine then a nail of tinder-wood with twenty points--it is verily no longer a nail. Yet nigh all mankind are like unto this. They wish a dozen different careers; and the force which might have been sufficient to attain eminence in one is wasted on the others: they are null. Here then let me make oÿen confession, and say thus: though I pledged myself almost in boyhood to the Great Work, though to my aid came the most puissant forces in the whole Universe to hold me to it, though habit itself now constraineth me in the right direction, yet I have not fulfilled my Will: I turn aside daily from the appointed task. I waver. I falter. I lag. Let this then be of great comfort to you all, that if I be so imperfect--and for very shame I have not emphasized that imperfection--if I, the chosen one, still fail, then how easy for yourselves to surpass me! Or, should you only equal me, then even so how great attainment should be yours! Be of good cheer, therefore, since both my failure and my success are arguments of courage for yourselves. Search yourselves cunningly, I pray you, analysing your inmost thoughts. And first you shall discard all those gross obvious hindrances to your Will: idleness, foolish friendships, waste employments or enjoyments, I will not enumerate the conspirators against the welfare of your State. Next, find the minimum of daily time which is in good sooth necessary to your natural life. The rest you shall devote to the True Means of your Attainment. And even these necessary hours you shall consecrate to the Great Work, saying consciously always while at these Tasks that you perform them only in order to preserve your body and mind in health for the right application to that sublime and single Object. It shall not be very long before you come to understand that such a life is the true Liberty. You will feel distractions from your Will as being what they are. They will no longer appear pleasant and attractive, but as bonds, as shames. And when you have attained this point, know that you have passed the Middle Gate of this Path. For you will have unified your Will. Even thus, were a man sitting in a theatre where the play wearies him, he would welcome every distraction, and find amusement in any accident: but if he were intent upon the play, every such incident would annoy him. His attitude to these is then an indication of his attitude towards the play itself. At first the habit of attention is hard to acquire. Persevere, and you will have spasms of revulsion periodically. Reason itself will attack you, saying: how can so strict a bondage be the Path of Freedom? Persevere. You have never yet known Liberty. When the temptations are overcome, the voice of Reason silenced, then will your soul bound forward unhampered upon its chosen course, and for"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"the first time will you experience the extreme delight of being Master of Yourself, and therefore of the Universe. When this is fully attained, when you sit securely in the saddle, then you may enjoy also all those distractions which first pleased you and then angered you. Now then will do neither any more: for they are your slaves and toys. Until you have reached this point, you are not wholly free. You must kill out desire, and kill out fear. The end of all is the power to live according to your own nature, without danger that one part may develop to the detriment of the whole, or concern lest that danger should arise. The sot drinks, and is drunken: the coward drinks not, and shivers: the wise man, brave and free, drinks, and gives glory to the Most High God. This then is the Law of Liberty: you possess all Liberty in your own right, but you must buttress Right with Might: you must win Freedom for yourself in many a war. Woe unto the children who sleep in the Freedom that their forefathers won for them! ‘ ‘ There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt:’’ but it is only the greatest of the race who have the strength and courage to obey it. O man! behold thyself! With what pains wast thou fashioned! What ages have gone to thy shaping! The history of the planet is woven into the very substance of thy brain! Was all this for naught? Is there no purpose in thee? Wast thou made thus that thou shouldst eat, and breed, and die? Think it not so! Thou dost incorporate so many elements, thou art the fruit of so many aeons of labour, thou art fashioned thus as thou art, and not otherwise, for some colossal End. Nerve thyself, then, to seek it and to do it. Naught can satisfy thee but the fulfilment of thy transcendent Will, that is hidden within thee. For this, then, up to arms! Win thine own Freedom for thyself! Strike hard! ,,\u0003\u00032)\u0003/29(\u0003\u0003IT IS WRITTEN that ‘ ‘ Love is the law, love under will.’’ Herein is an Arcanum concealed, for in the Greek Language Agaph, Love, is of the same numerical value as Velhma, Will. By this we understand that the Universal Will is of the nature of Love. Now Love is the enkindling in ecstacy of Two that will to become One. It is thus an Universal formula of High Magick. For see now how all things, being in sorrow caused by dividuality, must of necessity will Oneness as their medicine. Here also is Nature monitor to them that seek Wisdom at her breast: for in the uniting of elements of opposite polarities is there a glory of heat, of light, and of electricity. Thus also in mankind do we behold the spiritual fruit of poetry and all genius, arising from the seed of what is but an animal gesture, in the estimation of such as are schooled in Philosophy. And it is to be noted strongly that the most violent and divine passions are those between pe ple of utterly unharmonious natures. But now I would have you to know that in the mind are no such limitations in respect of species as prevent a man falling in love with an inanimate object, or an idea. For to him that is in any wise advanced upon the Way of Meditation it appears that all objects save the One Object are distasteful, even as appeared formerly in respect of his chance wishes to the Will. So therefore all"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"objects must be grasped by the mind, and heated in the sevenfold furnace of Love, until with explosion of ecstacy they unite, and disappear, for they, being imperfect, are destroyed utterly in the creation of the Perfection of Union, even as the persons of the Lover and the Beloved are fused into the spiritual gold of Love, which knoweth no person, but comprehendeth all. Yet since each star is but one star, and the coming together of any two is but one partial rapture, so must the aspirant to our holy Science and Art increase constantly by this method of assimilating ideas, that in the end, become capable of apprehending the Universe in one thought, he may leap forth upon It with the massed violence of his Self, and destroying both these, become that Unity whose name is No Thing. Seek ye all therefore constantly to unite yourselves in rapture with each and every thing that is, and that by utmost passion and lust of Union. To this end take chiefly all such things as are naturally repulsive. For what is pleasant is assimilated easily and without ecstacy: it is in the transfiguration of the loathsome and abhorred into The Beloved that the Self is shaken to the root in Love. Thus in human love also we see that mediocrities among men mate with null women: but History teacheth us that the supreme masters of the world seek ever the vilest and most horrible creatures for their concubines, overstepping even the limiting laws of sex and species in their necessity to transcend normality. It is not enough in such natures to excite lust or passion: the imagination itself must be enflamed by every means. For us, then, emancipated from all base law, what shall we do to satisfy our Will to Unity? No less a mistress than the Universe: no lupanar more cramped than Infinite Space: no night of rape that is not co-eval with Eternity! Consider that as Love is mighty to bring forth all Ecstacy, so absence of Love is the greatest craving. Whoso is balked in Love suffereth indeed, but he that hath not actively that passion in his heart towards some object is weary with the ache of craving. And this state is called mystically ‘ ‘ Dryness.’’ For this there is, as I believe, no cure but patient persistence in a Rule of life. But this Dryness hath its virtue, in that thereby the soul is purged of those things that impeach the Will: for when the drouth is altogether perfect, then is it certain that by no means can the Soul be satisfied, save by the Accomplishment of the Great Work. And this is in strong souls a stimulus to the Will. It is the Furnace of Thirst that burneth up all dross within us. But to each act of Will is a particular Dryness corresponding: and as Love increaseth within you, so doth the torment of His absence. Be this also unto you for a consolation in the ordeal! Moreover, the more fierce the plague of impotence, the more swiftly and suddenly is it wont to abate. Here is the method of Love in Meditation. Let the Aspirant first practice and then discipline himself in the Art of fixing the attention upon any thing whatsoever at will, without permitting the least imaginable distraction. Let him also practice the art of the Analysis of Ideas, and that of refusing to allow the mind its natural reaction to them, pleasant or unpleasant, thus fixing himself in Simplicity and Indifference. These things being achieved in their ripe season, be it known to you that all ideas will have become equal to your apprehension, since each is simple and each indifferent: any one of them remaining in the mind at Will without stirring or striving, or tending to pass on to any other. But each idea will possess one special quality common to all: this, that no one of any of them is The Self, inasmuch as it is perceived by The Self as Something Opposite. When this is thorough and profound in the impact of its realization, then is the moment for the aspirant to direct his Will to Love upon it, so that his whole consciousness findeth focus upon that One Idea. And at the first it may be fixed and dead, or lightly held. This may then pass into dryness,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"or into repulsion. Then at last by pure persistence in that Act of Will to Love, shall Love himself arise, as a bird, as a flame, as a song, and the whole Soul shall wing a fiery path of music unto the Ultimate Heaven of Possession. Now in this method there are many roads and ways, some simple and direct, some hidden and mysterious, even as it is with human love whereof no man hath made so much as the first sketches for a Map: for Love is infinite in diversity even as are the Stars. For this cause do I leave Love himself master in the heart of every one of you: for he shall teach you rightly if you but serve him with diligence and devotion even to abandonment. Nor shall you take umbrage or surprise at the strange pranks that he shall play: for He is a wayward boy and wanton, wise in the Wiles of Aphrodite Our Lady His sweet Mother: and all His jests and cruelties are spices in a confection cunning as no art may match. Rejoice therefore in all His play, not remitting in any wise your own ardour, but glowing with the sting of His whips, and making of Laughter itself a sacrament adjuvant to Love, even as in the Wine of Rheims is sparkle and bite, like as they were ministers to the High Priest of its Intoxication. It is also fit that I write to you of the importance of Purity in Love. Now this matter concerneth not in any wise the object or the method of the practice: the one thing essential is that no alien element should intrude. And this is of most particular pertinence to the aspirant in that primary and mundane aspect of his work wherein he establisheth himself in the method through his natural affections. For know, that all things are masks or symbols of the One Truth, and nature serveth alway to point out the higher perfection under the veil of the lower perfection. So then all the Art and Craft of human love shall serve you as an hieroglyphic: for it is written that That which is above is like that which is below: and That which is below is like that which is above. Therefore also doth it behoove you to take well heed lest in any manner you fail in this business of purity. For though each act is to be complete on its own plane, and no influence of any other plane is to be brought in for interference or admixture, for that such is all impurity, yet each act should in itself be so complete and perfect that it is a mirror of the perfection of every other plane, and thereby becometh partaker of the pure Light of the highest. Also, since all acts are to be acts of Will in Freedom on every plane, all planes are in reality but one: and thus the lowest expression of any function of that Will is to be at the same time an expression of the highest Will, or only true Will, which is that already implied in the acceptance of the Law. Be it also well understood of you that it is not necessary or right to shut off natural activity of any kind, as certain false folk, eunuchs of the spirit, most foully teach, to the destruction of many. For in every thing soever inhereth its own perfection pr per to it, and to neglect the full operation and function of any one part bringeth distortion and degeneration to the whole. Act therefore in all ways, but transforming the effect of all these ways to the One Way of the Will. And this is possible, because all ways are in actual Truth One Way, the Universe being itself One and One Only, and its appearance as Multiplicity that cardinal illusion which it is the very object of Love to dissipate. In the achievement of Love are two principles, that of mastering and that of yielding. But the nature of these is hard to explain, for they are subtle, and are best taught by Love Himself in the course of the operations. But it is to be said generally that the choice of one formula or the other is automatic, being the work of that inmost Will which is alive within you. Seek not then to determine consciously this decision, for herein true instinct is not liable to err. But now I end, without further words: for in our Holy Books are written many details of the actual practices of Love. And those are the best and truest which are most subtly written in symbol and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"image, especially in Tragedy and Comedy, for the whole nature of these things is in this kind, Life itself being but the fruit of the flower of Love. It is then of Life that I must needs now write to you, seeing that by every act of Will in Love you are creating it, a quintessence more mysterious and joyous than you deem, for this which men call life is but a shadow of that true Life, your birthright, and the gift of the Law of Thelema. ,,,\u0003\u00032)\u0003/,)(\u0003\u0003SYSTOLE AND DIASTOLE: these are the phases of all component things. Of such also is the life of man. Its curve arises from the latency of the fertilized ovum, say you, to a zenith whence it declines to the nullity of death? Rightly considered, this is not wholly truth. The life of man is but one segment of a serpentine curve which reaches out to infinity, and its zeros but mark the changes from the plus to minus, and minus to plus, coefficients of its equation. It is for this cause, among many others, that wise men in old time chose the Serpent as the Hieroglyph of Life. Life then is indestructible as all else is. All destruction and construction are changes in the nature of Love, as I have written to you in the former chapter proximate. Yet even as the blood in one pulse-throb of the wrist is not the same blood as that in the next, so individuality is in part destroyed as each life passeth; nay, even with each thought. What then maketh man, if he dieth and is reborn a changeling with each breath? This: the consciousness of continuity given by memory, the conception of his Self as something whose existence, far from being threatened by these changes, is in verity assured by them. Let then the aspirant to the sacred Wisdom consider his Self no more as one segment of the Serpent, but as the whole. Let him extend his consciousness to regard both birth and death as incidents trivial as systole and diastole of the heart itself, and necessary as they to its function. To fix the mind in this apprehension of Life, two modes are preferred, as preliminary to the greater realizations to be discussed in their pr per order, experiences which transcend even those attainments of Liberty and Love of which I have hitherto written, and this of Life which I now inscribe in this my little book which I am making for you so that you may come unto the Great Fulfilment. The first mode is the acquisition of the Magical Memory so-called, and the means is described with accuracy and clearness in certain of our Holy Books. But for nearly all men this is found to be a practice of exceeding difficulty. Let then the aspirant follow the impulse of his own Will in the decision to choose this or no. The second mode is easy, agreeable, not tedious, and in the end as certain as the other. But as the way of error in the former lieth in Discouragement, so in the latter are you to be ware of False Paths. I may say indeed generally of all Works, that there are two dangers, the obstacle of Failure, and the snare of Success. Now this second mode is to dissociate the beings which make up your life. Firstly, because it is easiest, you should segregate that Form which is called the Body of Light (and also by many other names) and set yourself to travel in this Form, making systematic exploration of those worlds which are to other material things what your own Body of Light is to your own material form. Now it will occur to you in these travels that you come to many Gates which you are not able to pass. This is because your Body of Light is itself as yet not strong enough, or subtle enough, or pure enough: and you must then learn to dissociate the elements of that Body by a process similar"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"to the first, your consciousness remaining in the higher and leaving the lower. In this practice do you continue, bending your Will like a great Bow to drive the Arrow of your consciousness through heavens ever higher and holier. But the continuance in this Way is itself of vital value: for it shall be that presently habit herself shall persuade you that the body which is born and dieth within so little a space as one cycle of Neptune in the Zodiac is no essential of your Self, that the Life of which you are become partaker, while itself subject to the Law of action and reaction, ebb and flow, systole and diastole, is yet insensible to the afflictions of that life which you formerly held to be your sole bond with Existence. And here must you resolve your Self to make the mightiest endeavours: for so flowered are the meadows of this Eden, and so sweet the fruit of its orchards, that you will love to linger among them, and to take delight in sloth and dalliance therein. Therefore I write to you with energy that you should not do thus to the hindrance of your true progress, because all these enjoyments are dependent upon duality, so that their true name is Sorrow of Illusion, like that of the normal life of man, which you have set out to transcend. Be it according to your Will, but learn this, that (as it is written) they only are happy who have desired the unattainable. It is then best, ultimately, if it be your Will to find alway your chiefest pleasure in Love, that is, in Conquest, and in Death, that is, in Surrender, as I have written to you already. Thus then you shall delight in these delights aforesaid, but only as toys, holding your manhood firm and keen to pierce to deeper and holier ecstacies without arrest of Will. Furthermore, I would have you to know that in this practice, pursued with ardour unquenchable, is this especial grace, that you will come as it were by fortune into states which transcend the practice itself, being of the nature of those Works of Pure Light of which I will to write to you in the chapter following after this. For there be certain Gates which no being who is still conscious of dividuality, that is, of the Self and not-Self as opposites, may pass through: and in the storming of those Gates by fiery assault of lust celestial, your flame will burn vehemently against your gross Self, though it be already divine beyond your present imagining, and devour it in a mystical death, so that in the Passing of the Gate all is dissolved in formless Light of Unity. Now then, returning from these states of being, and in the return also there is a Mystery of Joy, you will be weaned from the Milk of Darkness of the Moon, and made partaker of the Sacrament of Wine that is the blood of the Sun. Yet at the first there may be shock and conflict, for the old thought persists by force of its habit: it is for you to create by repeated act the true right habit of this consciousness of the Life which abideth in Light. And this is easy, if your will be strong: for the true Life is so much more vivid and quintessential than the false that (as I rudely estimate) one hour of the former makes an impression on the memory equal to one year of the latter. One single experience, in duration it may be but a few seconds of terrestrial time, is sufficient to destroy the belief in the reality of our vain life on earth: but this wears gradually away if the consciousness, through shock or fear, adhere not to it, and the Will strive not continually to repetition of that bliss, more beautiful and terrible than death, which it hath won by virtue of Love. There be moreover many other modes of attaining the apprehension of true Life, and these two following are of much value in breaking up the ice of your mortal error in the vision of your being. And of these the first is the constant contemplation of the Identity of Love and Death, and the understanding of the dissolution of the body as an Act of Love done upon the Body of the Universe, as also it is written at length in our Holy Books. And with this goeth, as it were sister with twin brother, the practice of mortal love as a sacrament symbolical of that great Death: as it is written ‘ ‘ Kill thyself’’: and again ‘ ‘ Die daily.’’ And the second of these lesser modes is the practice of the mental apprehension and analysis of ideas, mainly as I have already taught you, but with especial emphasis in choice of things naturally repulsive, in particular, death itself, and its phenomena ancillary. Thus the Buddha bade his disciples to meditate upon Ten Impurities, that is, upon ten cases of death of decomposition, so that"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the Aspirant, identifying himself with his own corpse in all these imagined forms, might lose the natural horror, loathing, fear or disgust which he might have had for them. Know this, that every idea of every sort becomes unreal, phantastic, and most manifest illusion, if it be subjected to persistent investigation, with concentration. And this is particularly easy to attain in the case of all bodily impressions, because all material things, and especially those of which we are first conscious, namely, our own bodies, are the grossest and most unnatural of all falsities. For there is in us all, latent, that Light wherein no error may endure, and It already teaches our instinct to reject first of all those veils which are most closely wrapt about It. Thus also in meditation it is (for many men) most profitable to concentrate the Will to Love upon the sacred centres of nervous force: for they, like all things, are apt images or true reflexions of their semblables in finer spheres: so that, their gross natures being dissipated by the dissolving acid of the Meditation, their finer souls appear (so to speak) naked, and display their force and glory in the consciousness of the aspirant. Yea, verily, let your Will to Love burn eagerly toward this creation in yourselves of the true Life that rolls its waves across the shoreless sea of Time! Live not your petty lives in fear of the hours! The Moon and Sun and Stars by which ye measure Time are themselves but servants of that Life which pulses in you, joyous drum-beat as you march triumphant through the Avenue of the Ages. Then, when each birth and death of yours are recognized in this perception as mere milestones on your ever-living Road, what of the foolish incidents of your mean lives? Are they not grains of sand blown by the desert wind, or pebbles that you spurn with your winged feet, or grassy hollows were you press the yielding and elastic turf and moss with lyrical dances? To him who lives in Life naught matters: his is eternal motion, energy, delight of never-failing Change: unwearied, you pass on from aeon to aeon, from star to star, the Universe your playground, its infinite variety of sport ever old and ever new. All those ideas which bred sorrow and fear are known in their truth, and thus become the seed of joy: for you are certain beyond all proof that you can never die; that, though you change, change is part of your own nature: the Great Enemy is become the Great Ally. And now, rooted in this perfection, your Self become the very Tree of Life, you have a fulcrum for your lever: you are ready to understand that this pulsation of Unity is itself Duality, and therefore, in the highest and most sacred sense, still Sorrow and Illusion; which having comprehended, aspire yet again, even unto the Fourth of the Gifts of the Law, unto the End of the Path, even unto Light. ,9\u0003\u00032)\u0003/,*+7\u0003\u0003I PRAY YOU, be patient with me in that which I shall write concerning Light: for here is a difficulty, ever increasing, in the use of words. Moreover, I am myself carried away constantly and overwhelmed by the sublimity of this matter, so that plain speech may whirl into lyric, when I would plod peaceably with didactic, expression. My best hope is that you may understand by virtue of the sympathy of your intuition, even as two lovers may converse in language as unintelligible to others as it seemeth silly, wanton, and dull, or as in that other intoxication given by Ether the partakers commune with infinite wit, or wisdom, as the mood taketh them, by means of a word or a gesture, being initiated to apprehension by the subtlety of the drug. So may I that am inflamed with love of this Light, and drunken on the wine Ethereal of this Light, communicate not so much with your reason and intelligence, but with that principle hidden in yourself which is ready to partake with me. Even so may man and woman become mad with love, no word being spoken between them, because of the induction (as it were) of their souls. And your understanding will depend upon your ripeness for perception of my Truth. Moreover, if so be that Light in you be ready to break forth, then Light will interpret to you these dark words in the language of Light, even as a string inanimate, duly adjusted, will vibrate to its peculiar tone, struck on another cord. Read, therefore, not only with the eye and brain, but with the rhythm of the Life which you have attained by your Will to Love quickened to dancing measure by these words, which are the movements of the wand of my Will to Love, and so to enkindle your Life to Light."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"In this mood did I interrupt myself in the writing of this my little book, and for two days and nights sleeplessly have I made consideration, wrestling vehemently with my spirit, lest by haste or carelessness I might fail toward you. In exercise of Will and of Love are implied motion and change, but in Life is gained an Unity which moveth and changeth only in pulse or in phase, and is even as music. Yet in the attainment of this Life you will already have experienced that the Quintessence thereof is pure Light, an ecstacy formless, and without bound or mark. In this Light naught exists, for It is homogeneous: and therefore have men called it Silence, and Darkness, and Nothing. But in this, as in all other effort to name it, is the root of every falsity and misapprehension, since all words imply some duality. Therefore, though I call it Light, it is not Light, nor absence of Light. Many also have sought to describe it by contradictions, since through transcendent negation of all speech it may by some natures be attained. Also by images and symbols have men striven to express it: but always in vain. Yet those that were ready to apprehend the nature of this Light have understood by sympathy: and so shall it be with you who read this little book, loving it. However, be it known unto you that the best of all instruction on this matter, and the Word best suited to the Aeon of Horus, is written in The Book of the Law. Yet also the Book Ararita is right worthy in the Work of the Light, as Trigrammaton in that of Will, Cordis Cincti Serpente in the Way of Love, and Liberi in that of Life. All these Books also concern all these Four Gifts, for in the end you will see that every one is inseparable from every other. I wish to write to you with regard to the number 93, the number of Velhma. For it is not only the number of its interpretation Agaph, but also that of a Word unknown to you unless you be Neophyte of our Holy Order of the A...A... which word representeth in itself the arising of the Speech from the Silence, and the return thereunto in the End. Now this number 93 is thrice 31, which is in Hebrew LA, that is to say NOT, and so it denieth extension in the three dimensions of Space. Also I would have you to meditate most closely upon the name NU that is 56, which we are told to divide, add, multiply, and understand. By division cometh forth 0.12, as if it were written Nuith! Hadith! Ra- Hoor-Khuith! before the Dyad. By addition ariseth Eleven, the number of True Magick: and by multiplication Three Hundred, the Number of the Holy Spirit or Fire, the letter Shin, wherein all things are consumed utterly. With these considerations, and a full understanding of the mysteries of the Numbers 666 and 418, you will be armed mightily in this Way of far flight. But you should also consider all numbers in their scales. For there is no means of resolution better than this of pure mathematics, since already therein are gross ideas made fine, and all is ordered and ready for the Alchemy of the Great Work. I have already written to you of how, in the Will of Love, Light ariseth as the secret part of Life. And in the first, the little, Loves, the attained Life is still personal: later, it becometh impersonal and universal. Now then is Will arrived, may I say so, at its magnetic pole, whence the lines of force point alike every way and no way: and Love also is no more a work, but a state. These qualities are become part of the Universal Life, which proceedeth infinitely with the enjoyment of the Will, and of Love as inherent therein. These things therefore, in their perfection, have lost their names, and their natures. Yet these were the Substance of Life, its Father and Mother: and without their operation and impact Life itself will gradually cease its pulsations. But since the infinite energy of the whole Universe is therein, what then is possible but that it return to its own First Intention, dissolving itself little by little into that Light which is its most secret and most subtle Nature? For this Universe is in Truth Zero, being an equation whereof Zero is the sum. Whereof this is the proof, that if not, it would be unbalanced, and something would have come from Nothing, which is absurd. This Light or Nothing is then the Resultant or Totality thereof in pure Perfection; and all other states, positive or negative, are imperfect, since they omit their opposites. Yet, I would have you consider that this equality or identity of equation between all things and No thing is most absolute, so that you will remain no more in the one than you did in the other. And you will understand this greatest Mystery very easily in the light of those other experiences which you"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"will have enjoyed, wherein motion and rest, change and stability, and many other subtle opposites, have been redeemed to identity by the force of your holy meditation. The greatest gift of the Law, then, cometh forth by the most perfect practice of the Three Lesser Gifts. And so thoroughly must you travail in this Work that you are able to pass from one side of the equation to the other at will: nay, to comprehend the whole at once, and for ever. This then your time-and-space-bound soul shall travel according to its nature in its orbit, revealing the Law to them that walk in chains, for that this is your particular function. Now here is the Mystery of the Origin of Evil. Firstly, by Evil we mean that which is in opposition to our own wills: it is therefore a relative, and not an absolute, term. For everything which is the greatest evil of some one is the greatest good of some other, just as the hardness of the wood which wearieth the axeman is the safety of him that ventureth himself upon the sea in a ship built of that wood. And this is a truth easy to apprehend, being superficial, and intelligible to the common mind. All evil is thus relative, or apparent, or illusory: but, returning to philosophy, I will repeat that its root is always in duality. Therefore the escape from this apparent evil is to seek the Unity, which you shall do as I have already shewn you. But I will now make mention of that which is written concerning this in The Book of the Law. The first step being Will, Evil appears as by this definition, ‘ ‘ all that hinders the execution of the Will.’’ Therefore is it written: ‘ ‘ The word of Sin is Restriction.’’ It should also be noted that in The Book of the Thirty Aethyrs {Book 418} Evil appears as Choronzon whose number is 333, which in Greek importeth Impotence and Idleness: and the nature of Choronzon is Dispersion and Incoherence. Then in the Way of Love Evil appears as ‘ ‘ all that which tends to prevent the Union of any two things.’’ Thus The Book of the Law sayeth, under the figure of the Voice of Nuit: ‘ ‘ take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will! But always unto me.’’ For every act of Love must be ‘ ‘ under will,’’ that is, in accordance with the True Will, which is not to rest content with things partial and transitory, but to proceed firmly to the End. So also, in The Book of the Thirty Aethyrs, the Black Brothers are those who shut themselves up, unwilling to destroy themselves by Love. Thirdly, in the Way of Life Evil appears under a subtler form as ‘ ‘ all that which is not impersonal and universal.’’ Here The Book of the Law, by the Voice of Hadit, informeth us: ‘ ‘ In the sphere I am everywhere the centre’’. And again: ‘ ‘ I am Life and the giver of Life’’ {....} ‘ ‘ ‘ Come unto me’ is a foolish word: for it is I that go.’’ ‘ ‘ For I am perfect, being Not’’. For this Life is in every place and time at once, so that in It these limitations no longer exist. And you will have seen this for yourself, that in every act of Love time and space disappear with the creation of the Life by its virtue, as also doth personality itself. For the third time, then, in even subtler sense, ‘ ‘ The word of Sin is Restriction.’’ Lastly, in the Way of Light this same versicle is the key to the conception of Evil. But here Restriction is in the failure to solve the Great Equation, and, later, to prefer one expression or phase of the Universe to the other. Against this we are warned in The Book of the Law by the Word of Nuit, saying: ‘ ‘ None’’ {....} ‘ ‘ and two.

If thou thyself hast not a sure foundation, whereon wilt thou stand to direct the forces of Nature? 1. Know then, that as man is born into this world amidst the Darkness of Matter, and the strife of contending forces; so must his first endeavour be to seek the Light through their reconciliation. 2. Thou then, who hast trials and troubles, rejoice because of them, for in them is Strength, and by their means is a pathway opened unto that Light. 3. How should it be otherwise, O man, whose life is but a day in Eternity, a drop in the Ocean of time; how, were thy trials not many, couldst thou purge thy soul from the dross of earth? Is it but now that the Higher Life is beset with dangers and difficulties; hath it not ever been so with the Sages and Hierophants of the past? They have been persecuted and reviled, they have been tormented of men; yet through this also has their Glory increased. 4. Rejoice therefore, O Initiate, for the greater thy trial the greater thy Triumph. When men shall revile thee, and speak against thee falsely, hath not the Master said, \"Blessed art thou!\"? 5. Yet, oh aspirant, let thy victories bring thee not Vanity, for with increase of Knowledge should come increase of Wisdom. He who knoweth little, thinketh he"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"knoweth much; but he who knoweth much hath learned his own ignorance. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool, than of him. 6. Be not hasty to condemn others; how knowest thou that in their place, thou couldest have resisted the temptation? And even were it so, why shouldst thou despise one who is weaker than thyself? 7. Thou therefore who desirest Magical Gifts, be sure that thy soul is firm and steadfast; for it is by flattering thy weaknesses that the Weak Ones will gain power over thee. Humble thyself before thy Self, yet fear neither man not spirit. Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure: and courage is the beginning of virtue. 8. Therefore fear not the Spirits, but be firm and courteous with them; for thou hast no right to despise or revile them; and this too may lead thee astray. Command and banish them, curse them by the Great Names if need be; but neither mock nor revile them, for so assuredly wilt thou be lead into error. 9. A man is what he maketh himself within the limits fixed by his inherited destiny; he is a part of mankind; his actions affect not only what he calleth himself, but also the whole universe. 10. Worship and neglect not, the physical body which is thy temporary connection with the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mental Equilibrium be above disturbance by material events; strengthen and control the animal passions, discipline the emotions and the reason, nourish the Higher Aspirations. 11. Do good unto others for its own sake, not for reward, not for gratitude from them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long for thine ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. 12. Remember that unbalanced force is evil; that unbalanced severity is but cruelty and oppression; but that also unbalanced mercy is but weakness which would allow and abet Evil. Act passionately; think rationally; be Thyself. 13. True ritual is as much action as word; it is Will. 14. Remember that this earth is but an atom in the universe, and that thou thyself art but an atom thereon, and that even couldst thou become the God of this earth whereon thou crawlest and grovellest, that thou wouldest, even then, be but an atom, and one amongst many. 15. Nevertheless have the greatest self-respect, and to that end sin not against thyself. The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and wilfully to reject truth, to fear knowledge lest that knowledge pander not to thy prejudices."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"16. To obtain Magical Power, learn to control thought; admit only those ideas that are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and contradictory Idea that presents itself. 17. Fixed thought is a means to an end. Therefore pay attention to the power of silent thought and meditation. The material act is but the outward expression of thy thought, and therefore hath it been said that \"the thought of foolishness is sin.\" Thought is the commencement of action, and if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do? 18. Therefore, as hath already been said, Establish thyself firmly in the equilibrium of forces, in the centre of the Cross of the Elements, that Cross from whose centre the Creative Word issued in the birth of the Dawning Universe. 19. Be thou therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice; be energetic and strong like the Salamanders, but avoid irritability and ferocity; be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability; be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice. 20. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself to command the Spirits of the elements. For wert thou to summon the Gnomes to pander to thine avarice, thou wouldst no longer command them, but they would command thee. Wouldst thou abuse the pure beings of the woods and mountains to fill thy coffers and satisfy thy hunger of Gold? Wouldst thou debase the Spirits of Living Fire to serve thy wrath and hatred? Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Waters to pander to thy lust of debauchery? Wouldst thou force the Spirits of the Evening Breeze to minister to thy folly and caprice? Know that with such desires thou canst but attract the Weak, not the Strong, and in that case the Weak will have power over thee. 21.

The communicatingIntelligence identified Itself as Aiwass, a messenger of the ruling hierarchy of our species.The Book announces a New Law for mankind and the planetary transition into the Aeon ofHorus or New Aeon. The Book is conceived to be a perfect transmission of the divine, freedfrom any defects of human interference. As such, it is a luminous vehicle of Truth that canserve as an infallible guide to human conduct.Aleister Crowley will at least be remembered as the greatest occult genius of the twentiethcentury. In The Book of the Law, he is designated as the Prophet of the New Aeon. Anenormously prolific writer, his own work provides the best guide to his controversialcharacter. His biographers have failed to capture his essence, even when not being overtlyhostile. His influence on modern occultism is incalculable, penetrating every Western school.The present collection of papers, a minute sample of his literary production, should give eventhe first time reader a distinct impression of Crowley.The O.T.O. practices yoga, meditation, ceremonial magick, qabalah, divination and relateddisciplines of the Western Mystery Tradition. Our central headquarters, long centered inBerkeley, California, is now moving to New York, with numerous groups spread throughoutthe world. The Order is open to all free men and women of full age (currently defined aseighteen years old) and good report.The Order Degrees, as described in several Order documents included in this issue, areconveyed in a ceremonial manner. The Degree structure corresponds with the Hindu Chakrasystem as diagrammed elsewhere in this issue. Thus, the Man of Earth series of degrees fullyactivates the psychic body of the Initiate.In addition to the Degree rituals, numerous Order bodies regularly perform the O.T.O.Gnostic Mass, which also appears elsewhere in this issue. The importance of the Mass withinthe O.T.O. is best illustrated in Crowley's Confessions where he calls the ritual ''the centralceremony of its {the Order's} public and private celebration.''Various other group rituals are performed, unique to each unit of the Order and generallyindicative of the main interests of the members of the group concerned. These may includeCrowley's group workings such as his Rites of Eleusis, original adaptations of various myth"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"cycles, revisions of solo rituals for group participation, or other creative efforts.AN INTRODUCTION TO SECRET SOCIETIESWE POSIT A KNOWLEDGE, or Gnosis, capable of perception by each human being­­for,''Every man and every woman is a star.'' We further posit that Divine consciousness isexperiential and that certain techniques are of value to induce the experience.The religious instinct is an integral aspect of mankind. From time immemorial, people havegathered with one another to seek Truth and therein lie the roots of the Order. Secret societiesdedicated to seeking wisdom have existed in all ages and cultures. From the puberty rite ofthe aboriginal tribesman, to the ecstatic whirling of the Dervish, to the elaborate ceremoniesof the Mason, the aim is the same­­the programmed alteration of consciousness within agroup setting.Myths that seek to explain the emerging of consciousness within the human race have been acontinuous cultural phenomena. The Egyptian, Sumerian, Indian, Chinese, Greek, NearEastern, Celtic and other civilizations had Mystery Traditions of the most central societalimport. Each had its teaching legends of figures who mysteriously appeared to bring the giftsof civilization and spiritual wisdom.These transmitting Forces have been variously conceived of as Gods, angels, spirits and by ahost of other designations. It is to these same Beings (whatever aesthetic is used to describeThem) that we ascribe the religious awareness transmitted through the O.T.O. today.''ERA VULGARIS''THE MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES have characteristically functioned as a birthplaceof religions and religious movements. Three of the world's largest religions, Christianity,Judaism, and Islam began in this region. And prior to the inception of these, dating back toprehistory, the indigenes have worshipped such deities as Oannes, Osiris, Enki, Adonis,Attys and others. The area therefore has traditionally been one of unusual religious cross­fertilization and constant political upheaval.It is a recurrent historical theme for governments to attempt to control the religion of a peoplein order to achieve stability. In 325 E.V., the Roman Emperor Constantine convened a groupof religious leaders from the area to achieve this goal. He became the first ruler to adoptChristianity as the state religion. The Council of Nice, or Nicene Council, epitomized thefuture of the religion. The purpose of the meeting was to settle a theological dispute. Theloser was anathemized and exiled, his books ordered burned and their possession became acapital offense. A hypocratic yea­saying to the first creed of the new faith cemented the workof the Council. All this took place under the ''benign'' direction of the pagan Emperor, anotorious murderer who liberally rewarded the attending bishops after their work wasfinished.The standardization of the books of The Bible followed some years later. Elements of"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"mysticism incompatible with the ''reform'' were neatly removed from the Canon. The viciouspersecution of Gnostics, Pagans and Jews assured no philosophic rivalry with the growingChristian ideological consolidation. In 391 E.V., an angry Christian mob destroyed theAlexandrian Library and Temple (the great repository of pagan learning). This dealt a majorblow to the spirit of intellectual research and hindered the possibility of exposing the fraudbeing built on the then­living remains of earlier cults.Heresy became a catch­all phrase for religious speculation. Philosophy, so highly cultivatedin pagan society, was constricted. It would be several centuries before the power wasachieved to turn this policy into mass murder, but rehearsals for the Inquisition were wellunder way in the interim. An example was the murder of Hypatia in 415 E.V. Famed leaderof the Neo­Platonic School, she was torn limb from limb by a band of enraged Christianmonks. Great Pan was certainly not dead, but one can imagine His wailing for the humansuffering to come.THE CRUSADESPRIOR TO THE BEGINNING of the Crusades in 1095, Europe was experiencing a periodof cultural stagnation caused jointly by the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and theattempts of the Church to assume temporal sovereignty over its remains. The resultingconfusion led to a usurpation of direct control by a number of once­vassal princes, giving riseto the system of Feudalism. The chaos of the period is best illustrated by the eagerness withwhich vast numbers of Europeans joined the Crusades.The Holy Land contained the seeds of the later Renaissance. Arab culture was at its highestand most refined. The area now added European Christianity to its religious potpourri. TheMystics, Fakirs, Zoroastrians, Gnostics, Sufis and Buddhists of the region presented akaleidoscopic panorama to the newly arrived Crusaders. The superstitions and dogmas ofCatholicism must have seemed quite pale, when compared to the richness and sophisticationof the Oriental theologies to which they were now exposed. Increasing doubt concerning theexclusive possession of divine favor by Christianity would gradually undermine orthodoxy.THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARDUE TO THE NATURE of the European presence, the Military Orders were the moststable institutions during the 200 years of Western occupation. The soldiers were involvedwith the exotic culture of their new homeland on a daily basis.Foremost among the Military Orders was the Knights Templar. Founded by Hughes dePayens in 1118, the Order was originally composed of nine Knights, who protected pilgrimson their travels through the Holy Land. King Baldwin II, the second European King ofJerusalem, awarded them lodging near the site of the Temple of Solomon, from whencederives their name.The Military Orders were clearly an idea whose time had come. The concept of a religiousbody of warriors was new to Christianity. The promise of glory, danger, travel, religious"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"expiation, and the chance to fight to establish God's Kingdom on earth, fell upon waiting andready ears.In 1126 the Templars came under the patronage of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the mostinfluential and politically powerful Catholic theologian of his time. He aided their effortsenormously. At the Council of Troyes in 1128, St. Bernard presided over the writing of theirRule which dictated the behavior of the members of the Order. They were concurrentlysanctioned by Pope Honorious. Within a short period of time, they amassed vast stores ofwealth and land donated by aristocrats excited by their charisma.The Templar Rule gradually expanded to include secret initiation rituals and privateconfessors. They were under direct control of the Pope and not responsible to any King ornation. As the European position weakened over the two centuries of occupation, theTemplars were accused of collusion with the enemy on more than one occasion. It was noted,for example, that the colors of their mantles (a red cross on a white background, adopted in1146) were the same as those of the Assassins or Hashishim.The Assassins, founded in 1090 by Hasan­i­Sabah, grew as an independent Shiite­Ishmailiforce within the primarily Sunni Muslim world. They rose to prominence by maintainingextremely well defended mountain fortresses, and by pursuing a policy of selectiveassassination. Their isolation and essential fanaticism suggest ingrained doctrines of anunorthodox nature. That there was communication between the Templars and Assassins iswell known. Also, the hierarchical similarities between the two Orders are noteworthy. (TheAssassins were crushed by the Mongols in 1256, but their descendants now live in Indiaunder the leadership of the Aga Khan.)The Europeans were finally defeated in 1291 and the Templars left the Holy Land. On theirreturn to Europe they were warily welcomed. Their independent, armed presence causedtension because there was no longer a pressing rationale for their existence. However, beingthe Pope's personal army, they still enjoyed his protection. They participated, for example, inthe Albigensian massacres at his behest.Finally, through the malice and greed of Philip the Fair of France and the weakness of PopeClement V, the Templars were arrested in France on a single night in 1307. (Philip hadestablished a precedent for this by similarly arresting every French Jew eight years before.)The Pope, under Philip's direction, issued a European edict requiring all nations to arrest theTemplars within their borders. The edict was ignored or cursorily complied to by severalnations, notably Germany, Scotland, Spain and Portugal. However, the French, Italian andEnglish Temples were destroyed, thousands of Knights killed over the next seven years andthe vast wealth of the Order confiscated by civil and religious authorities.Many feel that the bankrupt Philip seized upon the idea of crushing the Order when he ran tothe Parisian Temple for protection from an angry mob incensed by his monetary policies andcurrency manipulations. During his three­day refuge, he would have realized the extent ofTemplar riches. For among other things, they had established the practice of internationalbanking among Christians. Their numerous fortresses along the trade routes leading Eastward"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"served as depositories for kings, nobles and merchants. The Templars had grown evenwealthier thereby. Another motivation for Philip's hostility to the Order was that hisapplication to join the Temple some years earlier had been refused by the these proudwarriors.THE TEMPLAR LEGACYTEMPLAR SURVIVORS generally changed the name of the Order, joined fellow Orderslike the Hospitaliers, or went quietly underground. It is our contention that they continued toteach the doctrines and techniques they had learned and developed in the East­­the ''secretteaching'' of the Order. We further posit that this closely guarded teaching gave rise to theflourishing of the occult arts in Europe.The centuries following the Templar dispersion in the fourteenth century played host to anesoteric revival which has continued to the present day.The first written literature of the Grail Tradition appeared almost simultaneously with thefounding of the Knights Templar. The Templar phenomena certainly inspired later authorslike Wolfram von Eschenbach, whose Parzival, written in the late twelfth and early thirteencenturies, precisely reveals the symbolism of the O.T.O. lamen. Parzival's first publication inprinted form in 1477 closely corresponded with the introduction of the Tarot into Europe.The Tarot includes among the rich threads of its symbolic tapestry a perfect pictorialrepresentation of the Grail symbols. Interestingly, St. Bernard and his Cisterician Order areacknowledged by Pauline Matarasso in The Quest of the Holy Grail as the source of themonastic guidance given to the Grail companions. The white habits of the monks, theirconsistent isolation as hermits and the virtues they espouse to the Knights being pureCistercian doctrine.Alchemy developed a considerable body of literature in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies, which witnessed the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, Trithemius and Bruno. Thepublication of the Rosicrucian Manifestos in 1614 and 1615 introduced the concept of aSecret Order of Adepts, silently guiding humanity's destiny. The idea fascinated the Europeanmind and became the model for Mozart's Magic Flute and other epic poems and plays of theperiod. The Enochian workings of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley were a particular nexuspoint of this Current. The plans for the utopian Palatinate of Frederick V were conceived inthis remarkable period, which also saw the rise of such occult luminaries as Robert Fludd,Michael Maier, Elias Ashmole and Johann De Bry.The great interest in Occultism continued unabated into the eighteenth century. Court deGebelin introduced the theory that the Tarot was derived from Egypt and had a qabalisticcorrespondence with the Hebrew alphabet. Freemasonry spread at a rapid rate. Its Lodgesplayed a pivotal role during the French Revolution. The legendary shadow figures of theComte de St. Germain and Cagliostro were reputed to be organizing rebellion everywhere.The Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, grew rapidly, giving rise to endlessspeculations of political conspiracy. It is still rumored today that the destruction of the Frenchmonarchy during the Revolution was intended to avenge Templar blood shed some four"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"hundred years earlier.In the nineteenth century, Kenneth MacKenzie, Frederick Hockley, Eliphas Levi, Sir EdwardBulwer Lytton, Papus, P. B. Randolph, W. Wynn Westcott, and others, wrote about,practiced and taught the sacred sciences. Madame Blavatsky founded the TheosophicalSociety in 1875, the year of Crowley's birth. The Golden Dawn was founded in 1888 andincluded among its members some of the leading lights of English literary and artistic circles.The erudite occult scholar, S. L. MacGregor Mathers was its most notable head. The geniusof his contribution to the development of the Western Qabalah must be appreciated beforeany comprehension of Crowley's work is possible. Crowley rose rapidly in the ranks of theGolden Dawn which served as his occult training ground.THE MODERN O.T.O.IN 1895, KARL KELLNER (|850­n­|905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paperchemist, as well as a high­grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis. Kellner hadtraveled widely in the East, where he met three Adepts who instructed him in specific magicalpractices. Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann,Heinrich Klein and Theodor Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss' Masonic publication, Oriflamme. OnKellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head. The ''Jubilee'' edition of the Oriflamme,published in 1912, announced that the Order taught the secret of sexual magic.Theodor Reuss was an interesting character. Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he enteredMasonry in 1876. He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian politicalpolice, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, whointroduced him to John Yarker. Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis andMizraim in Germany. After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reusssettled on the development of the O.T.O.The Order experienced a reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, hechartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA. In1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred. Crowley wrote that Reusscame to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets. When Crowley responded that hehad no idea what Reuss was talking about, Reuss opened to a chapter in The Book of Lies.When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itselfto him for the first time. Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all theEnglish speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing thematerial in The Equinox.Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and namedCrowley his successor. All was well until 1925 when The Book of the Law was translatedinto German. There was a break in the continuity of the Order. Many members split with thenew O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. Hehad earlier revised the Order rituals at Reuss' request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"New Aeon revelation.Crowley published many of his most important works under the imprimatur of the O.T.O..He reformulated its long­term goals and mission and came to view the O.T.O. as the ''ark'' forpreserving the distillation of the world's cultures into the future. These views are bestexpressed by Crowley himself, in his summary of the O.T.O. system excerpted from hisConfessions in this issue. Crowley succeeded in fostering a few strong leaders in NorthAmerica, and it is to these deep roots that the O.T.O. owes its continued survival. As hewrites in Liber Aleph, ''This Magick...dependeth greatly on the Art to set many other Wills insympathetic Motion; and the greatest Magus may not be the most successful­­in a meanConception of a Limit of Time.''The O.T.O. in North America was founded in 1912 when Charles Stansfeld Jones (well­known as Frater Achad) brought together twelve sincere and interested associates inVancouver, British Columbia, all of whom signed forms agreeing to take initiation throughthe III°. They were duly chartered as a Agapé Camp (later a Lodge), and Crowley spokeglowingly of their work in his Confessions where he recounts his inspection tour inVancouver.Frater Achad, as Parzival X°, continued to stimulate O.T.O. activity in both Canada and theUnited States for many years. However, it was left to one of the charter members of theVancouver Lodge, Wilfred T. Smith, to found the first Lodge in the United State in the1930's­­ Agapé Lodge in Pasadena, California. In Crowley's later years, Agapé Lodge wasthe single most active Order body in the world, prompting Baphomet's appointment of Smithas Ramaka X°. Smith and his Lodge members contributed greatly to Crowley's publishingefforts, and performed a weekly Gnostic Mass for many years. Bro. Smith's wife, Soror G.,continues his important work after his death, and remains an honored and active AgapéLodge member to this day. Soror Meral, Mistress of 418 Lodge, publisher of In TheContinuum and head of the College of Thelema in California took her first initiation at AgapéLodge, as did the late Caliph Hymenaeus Alpha X°. The membership of Agapé Lodge alsoincluded the illustrious scientist John W. Parsons, who helped found the Jet PropulsionLaboratory at Cal Tech's Arroyo Seco. A crater on the Moon is named after him, in honor ofhis developmental work on the rocket fuel that launched America into space.THE O.T.O. AFTER CROWLEY'S DEATHWHEN CROWLEY DIED in 1947, he willed all otherwise unassigned copyrights andliterary remains to the O.T.O., and the succession as Outer Head of the Order to KarlGermer, Frater Saturnus X°. Germer had long served as Grand Treasurer General andCrowley's Legate in the U.S., and Crowley directed that all the aforementioned property beshipped to Germer at the new O.T.O. Headquarters in New York. His strength of positionwithin the Order, and the respect and, some would say, fear that he commanded made himthe acknowledged leader. Crowley had in fact many times referred to him as his naturalsuccessor.Germer was born in Germany in 1885. He had a distinguished military career in the First"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"World War and was active in the influential German Pansophia movement of the 1920s.Years later, when the Nazis assumed control, he was imprisoned because of his connectionwith freemasonry and Aleister Crowley. While in Berlin's notorious Alexanderplatz Prison,and later in a Belgian concentration camp, he endured great privation by reciting the HolyBooks from memory, backward and forward, until he attained to the Knowledge andConversation of his Holy Guardian Angel. He supported Crowley diligently especially in thelater period of the latter's life.Germer was a quiet man, given to self­isolation. The Order ceased to initiate new membersunder his direction. His policy was to concentrate almost exclusively on the publishingprogram. Some fine results were accomplished, including Magick Without Tears, The GospelAccording to St. Bernard Shaw, 777 Revised, The Vision and the Voice (with Commentary)and The Book of Lies (with Commentary).Germer died in 1962 without naming a successor. His unprobated will directed only that theproperty of the Order be divided among the ''heads'' of the Order.The intervening years have not been lacking in claimants to leadership of the Order. Thepublished record stands for itself. With some diligent investigation, interested parties can learnthe details for themselves.We (and recently the United States Government has legalized our opinion) view thesuccession as having been passed to Major Grady Louis McMurtry, Caliph HymenaeusAlpha. His leadership of the Ordo Templi Orientis rests on several rather clear letters ofauthorization from Crowley himself. They met while McMurtry was a young First Lieutenantduring World War II. He had been admitted to the O.T.O. in 1941 at Agapé Lodge throughJack Parsons. He received the Ninth Degree from Crowley directly and was entrusted withdocuments of emergency authorization to take charge of the entire work of the Order inCalifornia (as stated earlier, the only functional O.T.O. body at this time.) Crowleyadditionally appointed McMurtry his personal representative in the USA, whose authoritywas to be considered as Crowley's own. These two charters, dated respectively March 22,1946 and April 11, 1946, were subject only to Karl Germer's approval, veto or revision.Germer was well informed of these charters as he attended the Agapé Lodge meeting atwhich McMurtry presented them. The two men subsequently exchanged correspondenceregarding plans to legally incorporate the Order in California. In a letter to McMurtry datedMay 24, 1946, Germer stated, ''I want you to be fully informed, as 666 holds you in charge ofthe Californian activities with any steps you decide to be taken with my approval.'' Whateverdifferences they may have had, there is nowhere the slightest suggestion that Germer evenconsidered vetoing or revising McMurtry's charters.Six months before his death, Crowley wrote to McMurtry on June 17, 1947. He stated thatwhile Germer was the natural Caliph to follow him, he had to look to Germer's successor,who, he wrote, could well be McMurtry.McMurtry disagreed with Germer's policy of not initiating new members. He moved to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Washington, D.C. in 1961 largely to avoid a direct confrontation with Germer over this issue.Here he taught Political Science at George Washington University while working as aManagement Analyst for the Government. He also directed the Washington ShakespeareSociety. In 1969, he learned of the 1967 theft of the Order Library from Mrs. Germer's home,during which she had been brutally beaten. He immediately resigned from GovernmentService and returned at once to California to conduct an investigation, reactivating hisauthorization from Crowley as Sovereign Grand Inspector General of the Order. The resultsof his extensive research were forwarded to the authorities concerned, as well as Mrs.Germer, and form the substance of the Solar Lodge chapter in Ed Sanders' book, The Family.THE O.T.O. UNDER THE CALIPHATEWHEN MCMURTRY BECAME AWARE of the critical condition into which the Orderhad fallen after Germer's death, he was impelled to invoke his documents of emergencyauthorization from Crowley. His first public act was to arrange for the publication of theCrowley/Harris Thoth Tarot Cards in 1970. This deck has the power of assisting theMagician to invoke the energies of the New Aeon­­a visual tool for the programming ofconsciousness. In 1983, he released The Holy Books of Thelema. This collection of the ClassA documents are the founding documents of the Thelemic religion. The two publicationstaken together constitute the Prophet's essential legacy, the words and images of the NewAeon.In the 15 years since McMurtry assumed leadership, the Order has grown to its largest sizeever. With Lodges, Chapters and Camps in the U.S., Canada, South America, Germany,Norway, the Balkans, New Zealand and Australia, the Order is like a lotus opening to therays of the New Aeon Sun.We face many problems at present, yet, ''There is success'', and we work unremittingly. TheOrder has met the criteria for promulgatation of the O.T.O. Constitution in the United States.While some suggestions from An Open Letter to Those Who May Wish to Join the Order(see infra) appear quaint in these days of over­regulation (free railroad transport indeed!), wepresent these writings at this time that we may reaffirm our fealty to the principles therein.The structure envisioned by these documents is then both our reality and our goal. May theirwords be guides to those so chosen.POSTSCRIPTDURING THE WRITING of this article, on July 12, 1985 E.V., our Beloved CaliphHymenaeus Alpha celebrated his greater feast. On the day of his death, the Order wasnotified of our legal victory in a United States Federal Court which certified our exclusiveownership of all names, trademarks, insignia and copyrights willed by Crowley to the OrdoTempli Orientis.On September 21, our new Caliph was proclaimed. His dedication to the principles describedin the following pages assures us that they will be implemented fully and speedily.

His respect for his predecessor and his lineagehave impelled him to choose the name Hymenaeus Beta.

The court has heard the testimony, read the exhibits, andweighed the evidence. The court makes the following findings of fact by a preponderance ofthe evidence, makes the following conclusions of law, and directs that judgment be entered infavor of plaintiffs and against defendants on plaintiffs' complaint, defendants' counterclaims,and plaintiffs' counterclaims to the counterclaims.For simplicity, plaintiffs, counter­defendants, and counter­counter plaintiffs will be called``plaintiffs;'' and defendants, counterclaimants, and counter­counter defendants will be called``defendants.''FINDINGS OF FACT1. The organization and system of beliefs which is called ``Ordo Templi Orientis'' or ``OTO''is a mystical and fraternal organization begun around 1900. The chief international executiveof OTO is known as the ``Outer Head'' or ``OHO.'' Aleister Crowley became OHO inapproximately 1921 and served until his death in 1947. Crowley wrote, or rewrote fromearlier versions, many of the rituals, doctrine, and interpretative and instructive literature ofOTO. Crowley set forth the rules of operation and procedures of OTO in numerous books,essays, and correspondence.2. OTO had and now has lodges where its members meet. One such lodge, which existedduring the 1930's and subsequently, was Agape Lodge in California."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"3. After Crowley's death, Karl Germer became the OHO.4. At his death, Crowley left all of his previously undisposed intellectual and tangible literaryproperty to OTO. As OHO, Karl Germer took possession of all of the tangible property ofOTO around 1950 and moved the property to California.5. Karl Germer died in California in 1962. No will of Germer was offered for probate and theproperty of OTO remained in the possession of Germer's widow, Sasha Germer.6. Sasha Germer died in 1975.7. In 1976, plaintiffs obtained an order from the Superior Court of the State of California,Calaveras County, ``In the Matter of the Estate of Sasha Germer.'' The order decreed thatplaintiff Grady McMurtry was authorized to take possession, on behalf of OTO, of certainproperty identified as belonging to OTO. Pursuant to that order plaintiff McMurtry and otherstook possession of properties which had formerly been in the possession of Crowley, KarlGermer, Sasha Germer and OTO.8. Plaintiff OTO is now a California Corporation. It has a legal structure; is a membershiporganization; maintains records; has a set of beliefs; has an established set of procedures;conducts regular meetings; conducts financial transactions; initiates and promotes members;and follows the beliefs and practices derived from Crowley and the prior unincorporatedOTO. It is a continuation of the organization, beliefs and practices originally established andconducted by Crowley and OTO.9. Defendant Society Ordo Templi Orientis (``SOTO'') was incorporated in the State ofTennessee. SOTO is not the continuation of the organization, beliefs and practices originallyestablished by Crowley and OTO.10. Defendant Motta is a citizen of Brazil. He has for years been interested in the work ofOTO and Crowley. Motta has caused some literary works of Crowley to be published,commented, and edited, in his own name and in the name of OTO and SOTO.11. Plaintiff OTO now owns, holds all right and title to, has used, does now use, and has theright to use: the name ``Ordo Templi Orientis''; the initials ``OTO''; the various insignia,registers and symbols of OTO; all writings and publications of Crowley which were notassigned to others at the time of his death; the publications of other matters pertaining to OTO;and the trademarks, service marks, and copyrights pertaining to the same. Defendants do notown, hold, or have any right to the use of such properties.12. The name ``Thelema'' in connection with publications is a part of the property owned byplaintiff OTO. Plaintiff Smith has used that name on behalf of plaintiff OTO since 1962.Plaintiff OTO has the rights to the trademarks, service marks and copyrights of the name``Thelema,'' and equivalents of that name, in connection with publications.13. Defendants have used the name ``Thelema'' in publications subsequent to its use byplaintiffs. Defendants do not have ownership of or the legal right to use the name ``Thelema''"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"or its equivalents. Defendants' use of the name of ``Thelema'' was without the consent ofplaintiffs and constitutes infringement of that name. Defendants' use of the name ``Thelema''in connection with publications has caused confusion in the publishing industry and amongpurchasers of books, and will if continued cause confusion in the future. However, plaintiffshave not shown sufficient evidence of monetary losses from that confusion to support anaward of compensatory damages for defendants' improper use of the name ``Thelema.''14. Defendants' use, and purported registration of trademarks and copyrights under the names``OTO,'' ``Crowley,'' and ``Thelema'' were done in contemplation of this litigation and weredone without the rights of ownership of the property purportedly registered and copyrighted.15. Plaintiff McMurtry is the acting OHO of OTO in the United States and is the highestoverall member. Plaintiff McMurtry was personally assigned by Crowley, and continues toown, a 25% interest in Crowley's Magick Without Tears.16. Defendant Motta is not the OHO of OTO.17. In 1981 defendants published and distributed certain books in California and elsewherewhich contained statements regarding the individual plaintiffs listed below. Certain of thestatements were matters of opinion, or were matters pertaining to religious beliefs, and henceare protected under the First Amendment. The following statements about individual plaintiffswere not protected and were libelous:(a)Plaintiff P. Seckler (nee P. Wade, P. McMurtry) was accused of sending agang to assault and rob Sasha Germer, and was alleged to have misappropriatedproperty.(b)Plaintiff Grady McMurtry was alleged to have committed slander,misappropriated property, pirated property, delivered property to the hand ofthieves, and contributed to the death of Sasha Germer.(c)Plaintiff H. P. Smith was alleged to be a thief.(d)Plaintiff James Wasserman was alleged to have delivered property to thievesand to have pirated property.18. The statements made about the plaintiffs enumerated in paragraphs 17­a, b, c and d wereuntrue and constituted libel per se.19. The plaintiffs enumerated in paragraphs 17­a, b, c, d did not establish by sufficientevidence any special damages, but are entitled to general damages from defendants in theamount of $10,000 each.20. The publications of the libels in paragraph 17­a, b, c, and d were done with actual maliceby defendants, with knowledge of their falsity, and with a reckless disregard for the truth, andthose plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages from defendants in the amount of $25,000each."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"21. Neither plaintiffs nor defendants are parties engaged in the media business, and are notentitled to rights or defenses attributable thereto.22. There is not sufficient evidence to establish that defendants obtained any substantial grossrevenue or profit from their publications, or that plaintiffs lost any gross revenue or profit, tosupport an award of damages to plaintiffs for defendants' use of plaintiffs' names, publicationsor symbols.23. Plaintiff Wasserman was an agent of defendant Motta for certain purposes in 1976.Plaintiff Wasserman terminated that agency in 1976, and the termination was acknowledgedby defendant Motta. Any cause of action by Motta for the breach of that agency relationshipby Wasserman accrued in 1976.24. No property of defendants was converted by plaintiffs. Even if some personal propertiesof defendants were included in the material obtained by plaintiffs from Karl and SashaGermer, they were obtained in 1976, and the obtaining was known to defendants in 1976.25. Plaintiffs circulated among OTO members a letter written by defendant Motta to KarlGermer dealing with certain matters personal to Motta. Motta has not shown by sufficientevidence that the circulation was a violation of his right of privacy, or that the circulationcaused him any special or general damages. The circulation was not done with malice, but inconnection with the dispute between plaintiffs and defendants as to who was the OHO andwho rightfully held the properties of OTO. The circulation occurred, and was known bydefendant Motta to have occurred, more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint inthis action.26. Unless enjoined, defendants will continue to claim and use the name ``Ordo TempliOrientis'' and the initials ``OTO,'' and will continue to claim that defendant Motta is the OHOof OTO, and will use plaintiff OTO's names, insignia, initials, symbols, trademarks and otherproperties of plaintiff OTO to the injury of plaintiff OTO.CONCLUSIONS OF LAW1.

The author, Bro. Franz Hartmann, was an active memberof the German branch of the O.T.O. and is well­known for his activities on behalf of the Theosophicalmovement. The \"Preamble\" appears to have been added by another author, possibly Crowley, on itspublication in The Equinox. Its authorship precedes the subsequent Crowley/Reuss reformation of theOrder that harmonized its historical principles with the 93 Current. Bro. Hartmann's text shows traces of theVictorian style characteristic of the early founding documents of other groups such as the Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn and the Theosophical Society.­­H.B.PREAMBLEDURING THE LAST twenty­five years, constantly increasing numbers of earnest people and seekers aftertruth have been turning their attention to the study of the hidden laws of Nature.The growth of interest in these matters has been simply marvellous. Numberless societies, associations,orders, groups, etc., etc., have been founded in all parts of the civilized world, all and each following someline of occult study.While all these newly organized associations do some good in preparing the minds of thoughtful people fortheir eventually becoming genuine disciples of the One Truth, yet there is but one ancient organization ofMystics which shows to the student a Royal Road to discover the One Truth. This organization haspermitted the formation of the body known as the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars. It is a modernSchool of Magi. Like the ancient Schools of Magi it derived its knowledge from Egypt and Chaldea. Thisknowledge is never revealed to the profane, for it gives immense power for either good or evil to itspossessors.It is recorded in symbol, parable and allegory, requiring a Key for its interpretation.The symbols of Freemasonry were originally derived from the more ancient mysteries, as all who havetravelled the burning sands know. The ritual and ceremonies, signs and passwords have been preservedwith great fidelity; but the Real Key has been long lost to the crowd who have been initiated, advanced andraised in Masonry.The Key to this knowledge can, however, be placed within the reach of all those who unselfishly desire,study and work for its possession."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Symbols of Ancient Masonry, the Sacred Art of the Ancient Chemi (Egyptians), and Homer's GoldenChain are but different aspects of the One Great Mystery. They represent but different degrees of initiation.By the Right Use of the \"Key\" alone the \"Master Word\" can be found.In order to afford genuine seekers after Hermetic Truth some information on the aims of the Ancient Orderof Oriental Templars, we now print the preliminary instruction issued by the Fratres of this Order.FIRST INSTRUCTIONTo all whom it may concern­­LET IT BE KNOWN that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient order of sages, whoseobject is the amelioration and spiritual elevation of mankind, by means of conquering error and aiding menand women in their efforts of attaining the power of recognizing the truth. This Order has existed already inthe most remote and prehistoric times and it has manifested its activity secretly and openly in the worldunder different names and in various forms; it has caused social and political revolutions and proved to bethe rock of salvation in times of danger and misfortune. It has always upheld the banner of freedom againsttyranny, in whatever shape this appeared, whether as clerical or political, or social despotism or oppressionof any kind. To this secret order every wise and spiritually enlightened person belongs by right of his or hernature; because they all, even if they are personally unknown to each other, are one in their purpose andobject, and they all work under the guidance of the one light of truth. Into this sacred Society no one can beadmitted by another, unless he has the power to enter it himself by virtue of his own interior illumination;neither can any one after he has once entered, be expelled, unless he should expel himself by becomingunfaithful to his principles and forget again the truths which he has learned by his own experience.All this is known to every enlightened person; but it is known only to few that there exists also an external,visible organization of such men and women who, having themselves found the path to real self­knowledge, are willing to give to others, desirous of entering that path, the benefit of their experience andto act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be guided. As a matter of course, those persons whoare already sufficiently spiritually developed to enter into conscious communion with the great spiritualbrotherhood will be taught directly by the spirit of wisdom; but those who still need external advice andsupport will find this in the external organization of that society. In regard to the spiritual aspect of thisSecret Order, one of the Brothers says­­:\"Our community has existed ever since the first day of creation when the gods spoke the divine command:`Let there be light!' and it will continue to exist till the end of time. It is the Society of the Children of Light,who live in the light and have attained immortality therein. In our school we are instructed directly byDivine Wisdom, the Celestial Bride, whose will is free and who selects as her disciples those who aredevoted to her. The mysteries which we are taught embrace everything that can possibly be known inregard to God, Nature and Man. Every sage that ever existed in the world has graduated at our school; forwithout wisdom no man can be wise. We all study only one book, the book of nature, in which the keys toall secrets are contained, and we follow the only possible method in studying it, that of experience. Ourplace of meeting is the Temple of the Holy Spirit pervading the universe; easily to be found by the elect,but for ever hidden from the eyes of the vulgar. Our secrets cannot be sold for money, but we give themfree to every one capable to receive them.\""},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"As to the external organization of that Society, it will be necessary to give a glance at its history, which hasbeen one and the same in all times. Whenever that spiritual Society manifested itself on the outward planeand appeared in the world, it consisted at its beginning of a few able and enlightened people, forming anucleus around which others were attracted. But invariably, the more such a Society grew in numbers, themore became attracted to its elements, such as were not able to understand or follow its principles; peoplewho joined it for the purpose of gratifying their own ambition or for making the Society serve their ownends obtained the majority over those that were pure. Thereupon the healthy portion of it retired from thefield and continued their benevolent work in secrecy, while the remaining portion became diseased anddisrupted, and sooner or later died disgraced and profaned. For the Spirit had departed from them.For this reason the external organization of which we speak has resolved not to reveal its name or place tothe vulgar. Furthermore, for the same reason, the names of the teachers and members of this society shallremain unknown, except to such as are intimately associated with them in their common work. If it is saidthat in this way the society will gain only few members, it may be answered that our society has a spiritualhead, and that those who are worthy of being admitted will be guided to it by means of their intuition; whilethose who have no intuition are not ripe for it and not needed. It is better to have only a comparatively smallnumber of capable members than a great many useless ones.From the above it will be clear that the first and most necessary requirement of the new disciple is that hewill keep silent in regard to all that concerns the Society to which he is admitted. Not that there is anythingin that Society which needs to be afraid of being known to the virtuous and good; but it is not necessarythat things which are elevated and sacred should be exposed to the gaze of the vulgar and be bespattered bythem with mud. This would only impede the Society in its work.Another necessary requirement is mutual confidence between the teacher and the disciple; because adisciple who has no faith in his master cannot be taught or guided by him. There may be things which willappear strange, and for which no reasons can be given to the beginner, but when the disciple has attained acertain state of development all will be clear to him or her. The confidence which is required will also be oflittle service if it is only of a short duration. The way of the development of the soul, which leads to theawakening of the inner senses, is slow, and without patience and fortitude nothing will be accomplished.From all this it follows as a matter of course that the next requisite is obedience. The purpose of the discipleis to obtain the mastery over his own lower self, and for this reason he must not submit himself to the willof his lower nature, but follow the will of that higher nature, which he does not yet know, but which hedesires to find. In obeying the will of the master, instead of following the one which he believes to be hisown, but which is in reality only that of his lower nature, he obeys the will of his own higher nature withwhich his master is associated for the purpose of aiding the disciple in attaining the conquest over himself.The conquest of the higher self over the lower self means the victory of the divine consciousness in manover that which in him is earthly and animal. Its object is a realization of true manhood and womanhood,and the attainment of conscious immortality in the realization of the highest state of existence in perfection.These few preliminary remarks may be sufficient for those who desire information concerning our order; tothose who feel themselves capable to apply for admission, further instructions will be given."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"FRATER HALAYL III°Hymenaeus Alpha: In Memoriam HYMENAEUS ALPHA 777 was born as Grady Louis McMurtry on October 18, 1918 EVin Big Cabin, Oklahoma to Grady and Bee Ivery Puckett McMurtry.

In Fall 1943 he was initiated byBaphomet XI° into the IX° O.T.O. It was also Crowley who suggested he take the name`Umenaios A (Hymenaeus Alpha), which in Greek gematria adds to 777. A.C. wrote manyletters discussing him as a Caliph, a future successor. Crowley was guarding against thepossibility that Karl Germer (Saturnus X°), his ''heir apparent,'' might fail of an heir himselfand endanger the continued existence of the O.T.O. After the war Grady returned to the U.S.and earned his B.A. in Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. He also acted asCrowley's Sovereign Grand Inspector General of the California O.T.O. In April 1946 hereceived an appointment as Crowley's O.T.O. representative in the U.S.A., with ''hisauthority...to be considered as Ours.'' In the Korean War Major McMurtry returned to activeduty in the U.S. Army. He then returned to Berkeley to complete a Masters in PoliticalTheory. In the late 1950's he worked as a management analyst for the State Department ofLabor in Sacramento, moving in 1961 to Washington, D.C. to work for the LaborDepartment and the Washington Shakespeare Society. Karl Germer died in 1962 and didindeed fail of an heir­­ McMurtry therefore returned to California and used his emergencypowers from 666 as Caliph and de facto head of the O.T.O., presiding over the rebirth of theO.T.O.

It is OurLady of the Stars that speaketh to thee, O thou that art a star, a member of the Body of Nuith!Listen, for thine ears become dulled to the mean noises of the earth; the infinite silence of theStars woos thee with subtile musick. Behold her bending down above thee, a flame of blue,all­touching, all­penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, and her lithe body archedfor love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers, and think that all thy grossness shallpresently fall from thee as thou leapest to her embrace, caught up into her love as a dewdropinto the kisses of the sunrise. Is not the ecstasy of Nuit the consciousness of the continuity ofexistence, the omnipresence of her body? All that hath hurt thee was that thou knewest it not,and as that fadeth from thee thou shalt know as never yet how all is one. Again She saith: Igive unimaginable joys upon earth, certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death. This thouhast known. Time that eateth his children hath not power on them that would not be childrenof Time. To them that think themselves immortal, that dwell alway in eternity, conscious ofNuit, throned upon the chariot of the sun, there is no death that men call death. In all theuniverse darkness is only to be found in the shadow of a gross and opaque planet, as it werefor a moment; the universe itself is a flood of light eternal. So also death is but throughaccident; thou hast hidden thyself in the shadow of thy gross body, and taking it for reality,thou hast trembled. But the orb revolveth anon; the shadow passeth away from thee. There isthe dissolution, and the eternal ecstasy in the kisses of Nu! For inasmuch as thou hast madethe Law of Freedom thine, as thou hast lived in Light and Liberty and Love, thou hastbecome a Free­man of the City of the Stars."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"IILISTEN AGAIN to thine own voice within thee.

It first appeared in TheInternational (New York, February 1918).­­H.B.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.IT IS NOT POSSIBLE for the Master, o my brethren, who has fought so long with thosethings within Himself which have hindered Him, to expect that if toys be given to childrenthey will not play with them. But watch may rightly be held lest they injure themselvestherewith; this paper therefore, as a guard.O, My Brethren, even as every dog is allowed one bite, so let every wonder­worker beallowed one miracle. For it is right that he should prove his new power, lest he be deceivedby the wile and malice of the apes of Choronzon.But with regard to the repetition of miracles the cause is not similar. Firstly cometh forth thegeneral magical objection. The business of the aspirant is to climb the Middle Pillar fromMalkuth to Kether; and though the other Pillars must be grasped firmly as aids to equilibrium,he should in no wise cling to them. He aspires to the Knowledge and Conversation of hisHoly Guardian Angel, and all other works are deviations. He may however perform miracleswhen necessary in order to carry out this main work; thus. he may perform a divination toassist him to discover a suitable house for the purpose, or even evoke a planetary spirit toguard him and aid him during the time of preparation, if it be necessary. But in all such workslet him be well assured in himself that his sole object is really that Knowledge andConversation. Otherwise, he has broken concentration, and the One work alone being WhiteMagick, all others are Black Magick.Secondly ariseth a similar objection derived from considerations of Energy. For all miraclesinvolve loss; as it is said ``she perceived that virtue had gone out of him.'' The exception istherefore as follows, that such miracles as tend to the conservation or renewal of Energy arelawful. Thus the preparation of the Elixir of Life is blameless; and the practices of the IX° ofO.T.O. in general, so far as they have for object the gain of Strength, Youth, and Vitality.It may further be considered just to perform miracles to aid others, within certain limits. Onemust consciously say: I deliberately sacrifice Energy and my own Great Work for this Object.Therefore the Magician must first of all calculate whether or no the object be worthy of thesacrifice. Thus, in the first year of the Path of the Master Therion, he, with V.H. Frater VoloNoscere, evoked the Spirit Buer to save the life of V.H. Frater Iehi Aour; saying in"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"themselves: The life of this holy man is of vast importance to this Aeon; let us give up thissmall portion of our strength for this great end. The answer might have been made: Nay,nothing is ever lost; let him rather work out this evil Karma of ill­health, and die and incarnateanew in youth and strength. It is hard even now to say if this had been better. The holy mandid indeed recover, did attain to yet greater things, did awake a great people to aspiration; nooperation could ever have been more successful: Yet still there remaineth doubt as to whetherthe natural order of things had not conceived a finer flowering.But this is a general objection of the sceptical sort to all miracles of whatever kind, andleadeth anon into the quagmire of arguments about Free Will. The adept will do better to relyupon The Book of the Law, which urgeth constantly to action. Even rash action is better thannone, by that Light: let the magician then argue that his folly is part of that natural orderwhich worketh all so well.And this may be taken as a general license to perform any and every miracle according toone's will.The argument has therefore been swung to each extreme; and like all arguments, ends inchaos.The above concerning true miracles; but with regard to false miracles the case is altogetherdifferent.Since it is part of the Magick of every one to cause both Nature and man to conform to theWill, man may lawfully be influenced by the performance of miracles. But true miraclesshould not be used for this purpose; for it is to profane the nature of the miracle, and to castpearls before swine; further, man is so built that he will credit false miracles, and regard truemiracles as false. It is also useful at times for the magician to prove to them that he is animposter; therefore, he can easily expose his false miracles, whereas this must not be donewhere they are true; for to deny true miracles is to injure the power to perform them.Similarly, none of the other objections cited above apply to false miracles; for they are not,properly speaking, magick at all, and come under the heading of common acts. Only insofaras common acts are magick do they come under consideration, and here the objection may beraised that they are, peculiarly, Error; that they simulate, and so blaspheme, the Truth.Certainly this is so, and they must only be performed for the purpose of blinding the eyes ofthe malicious, and that only in that peculiar spirit of mockery which delights the initiates inthe Comedy of Pan.The end of the matter then is that as in Comedy and Tragedy all things are lawful, live thou inComedy or Tragedy eternally, never blinding thyself to think Life aught but mummery, andperform accordingly the false miracles or the true, as may be Thy Will.Love is the law, love under will."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" Liber LXXVII\"the law ofthe strong:this is our lawand the joyof the world.\" AL.

As remarked elsewhere in this issue, certain programshave yet to be implemented, and some will require modification in order to conform with thelaws governing non­profit religious organizations in various countries.­­H.B.Issued by Order: BAPHOMET XI° O.T.O., HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUMBRITANNIARUM, REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUSAN EPISTLE WRITTEN TO PROFESSOR L­­ B­­ K­­ who also himself waited for the NewAeon, concerning the O.T.O. and its solution of divers problems of Human Society,particularly those concerning Property, and now reprinted for General Circulation. My Dear Sir,­­Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I was glad to receive your letter of inquiry with regard to the Message of the Master Therion.It struck you naturally enough that on the surface there is little distinction between the NewLaw and the canon of Anarchy; and you ask, \"How is the Law to be fulfilled in the case oftwo boys who want to eat the same orange?\" But since only one boy (at most) can eat theorange, it is evident that one of them is mistaken in supposing that it is essential to his Will toeat it. The question is to be decided in the good old way by fighting for it. All that we ask isthat the fighting should be done chivalrously, with respect to the courage of the vanquished.\"As brothers fight ye!\" In other words, there is only this difference from our present state ofsociety, that manners are improved. There are many persons who are naturally slaves, whohave no stomach to fight, who tamely yield all to any one strong enough to take it. Thesepersons cannot accept the Law. This also is understood and provided for in The Book of theLaw: \"The slaves shall serve.\" But it is possible for any apparent slave to prove his masteryby fighting his &127;ppressors, even as now; but he has this additional chance in our system,that his conduct will be watched with kindly eye by our authorities, and his prowessrewarded by admission to the ranks of the master­class. Also, he will be given fair play."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"You may now ask how such arrangements are possible. There is only one solution to thisgreat problem. It has always been admitted that the ideal form of government is that of a\"benevolent despot,\" and despotisms have only fallen because it is impossible in practice toassure the goodwill of those in power. The rules of chivalry, and those of Bushido in theEast, gave the best chance to develop rulers of the desired type. Chivalry failed principallybecause it was confronted with new problems; to­day we know perfectly what thoseproblems were, and are able to solve them. It is generally understood by all men of educationthat the general welfare is necessary to the highest development of the particular; and thetroubles of America are in great part due to the fact that the men in power are often utterlydevoid of all general education.I would call your attention to the fact that many monastic orders, both in Asia and in Europe,have succeeded in surviving all changes of government, and in securing pleasant and usefullives for their members. But this has been possible only because restricted life was enjoined.However, there were orders of military monks, like the Templars, who grew and prosperedexceedingly. You recall that the Order of the Temple was only overthrown by a treacherouscoup d'état on the part of a King and of a Pope who saw their reactionary, obscurantist, andtyrannical programme menaced by those knights who did not scruple to add the wisdom ofthe East to their own large interpretation of Christianity, and who represented in that time amovement towards the light of learning and of science, which has been brought to fruition inour own times by the labours of the Orientalists from Von Hammer­Purgstall and Sir WilliamJones to Professor Rhys Davids and Madame Blavatsky, to say nothing of such philosophersas Schopenhauer, on the one hand; and by the heroic efforts of Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, andSpencer, on the other.I have no sympathy with those who cry out against property, as if what all men desire were ofnecessity evil; the natural instinct of every man is to own, and while man remains in thismood, attempts to destroy property must not only be nugatory, but deleterious to thecommunity. There is no outcry against the rights of proÿerty where wisdom and kindnessadminister it. The average man is not so unreasonable as the demagogue, for his selfish ends,pretends to be. The great nobles of all time have usually been able to create a happy family oftheir dependents, and unflinching loyalty and devotion have been their reward. The secret hasbeen principally this, that they considered themselves noble as well in nature as in name, andthought it foul shame to themselves if any retainer met unneccessary misfortune. The upstartof to­day lacks this feeling; he must try constantly to prove his superiority by exhibiting hispower; and harshness is his only weapon. In any society where each person has his allottedplace, and that a place with its own special honour, mutual respect and self­ respect are born.Every man is in his own way a king, or at least heir to some kingdom. We have manyexamples of such society to­day, notably universities and all associations of sport. No. 5 inthe Harvard crew does not turn round in the middle of the race and reproach No. 4 for beingmerely No. 4; nor do the pitcher and catcher of a crack baseball nine revile each otherbecause their tasks are different. It is to be noted that wherever team­work is necessary socialtolerance is an essential. The common soldier is invested with a uniform as well as his officer,and in any pr&127;ÿerly trained army he is taught his own canons of honour and self­respect.This feeling, more than mere discipline or the possession of weapons, makes the soldier more"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"than a match morally for a man not so clothed in pr&127;ÿer reverence for himself and hisprofession.University men who have passed through some crisis of hardship or temptation have oftentold me that the backbone of their endurance was the \"old shoÿ.\" Much of this is evidentlyfelt by those who talk of re­establishing the old trade guilds. But I fear I digress.I have, however, now placed before you the main points of my thesis. We need to extend tothe whole of society the peculiar feeling which obtains in our most successful institutions,such as the services, the universities, the clubs. Heaven and hell are states of mind; and if thedevil be really proud, his hell can hurt him little.It is this, then, that I desire to emphasize: those who accept the New Law, the Law of theAeon of Horus, the crowned and conquering child who replaces in our theogony thesuffering and despairing victim of destiny, the Law of Thelema, which is Do What ThouWilt, those who accept it (I say) feel themselves immediately to be kings and queens. \"Everyman and every woman is a star\" is the first statement of The Book of the Law. In thepamphlet, The Law of Liberty, this theme is embroidered with considerable care, and I willnot trouble you with further quotation.You will say swiftly that the heavenly state of mind thus induced will be hard put to it toendure hunger and cold. The thought occurred also to our founder, and I will endeavour toput before you the skeleton of his plan to avert such misfortune (or at least such ordeal) fromhis adherents.In the first place he availed himself of a certain organization of which he was offered thecontrol, namely, the O.T.O. This great Order accepted the Law immediately, and wasjustified by the sudden and great revival of its activities. The Law was given to our foundertwelve years ago; the O.T.O. came into his hands eight years later, in the vulgar year 1912. Itmust not be supposed that he was idle during the former period; but he was very young, andhad no idea of taking practical measures to extend the Dominion of the Law: he pursued hisstudies.However, with the sudden growth of the O.T.O. from 1912 E.V. onward, he began toperceive a method of putting the Law into general practice, of making it possible for men andwomen to live in accordance with the precepts laid down in The Book of the Law, and toaccomplish their wills; I do not say to gratify their passing fancies, but to do that for whichthey were intended by their own high destiny. For in this universe, since it is in equilibriumand the sum total of its energies is therefore zero, every force therein is equal and oÿposite tothe resultant of all the other forces combined. The Ego is therefore always exactly equal to theNon­Ego, and the destruction of an atom of helium would be as catastrophic to theconservation of matter and energy as if a million spheres were blotted into annihilation by thewill of God. I am well aware that from this point you could draw me subtly over the tiger­trapof the Freewill Controversy; you would make it difficult for me even to say that it is better tofulfil one's destiny consciously and joyously than like a stone; but I am on my guard. I willreturn to plain politics and common sense."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Our Founder, then, when he thought over this matter from a purely practical standpoint,remembered those institutions with which he was familiar, which flourished. He bethoughthimself of monasteries like Monsalvat, of universities like Cambridge, of golf clubs likeHoylake, of social clubs like the Cocoa­Tree, of co­operative societies, and, having sojournedin America, of Trusts. In his mind he expanded each of these to its nth power, he blendedthem like the skilled chemist that he was, he considered their excellences and their limitations;in a word, he meditated profoundly upon the whole subject, and he concluded with the visionof a perfect society.He saw all men free, all men wealthy, all men respected; and he planted the seed of hisUtopia by handing over his own house to the O.T.O., the organization which should operatehis plan, under certain conditions. What he had foreseen occurred; he had possessed onehouse; by surrendering it he became owner of a thousand houses. He gave up the world, andfound it at his feet.Eliphaz Levi, the great magician of the middle of the last century, whose philosophy madepossible the extraordinary outburst of literature in France in the fifties and sixties by itsdoctrine of the self­sufficiency of Art (\"A fine style is an aureole of holiness\" is one phrase ofhis), prophesies of the Messiah in a remarkable passage. It will be seen that our founder, bornas he was to the purple, has fulfilled it.I have not the volume at my side, living as I am this hermit life in New Hampshire, but its gistis that Kings and Popes have not power to redeem the world because they surroundthemselves with splendour and dignity. They possess all that other men desire, and thereforetheir motives are suspect. If any person of position, says Levi, insists upon living a life ofhardship and inconvenience when he could do otherwise, then men will trust him, and he willbe able to execute his projects for the general good of the commonwealth. But he mustnaturally be careful not to relax his austerities as his power increases. Make power andsplendour incompatible, and the social problem is solved.\"Who is that ragged man gnawing a dry crust by yonder cabin?\" \"That is the President of theRepublic.\" Where honour is the only possible good to be gained by the exercise of power, theman in power will strive only for honour.The above is an extreme case; no one need go so far nowadays; and it is important that thePresident should have been used to terrapin and becasse flambe before he went into politics.You will ask how this operated, and how the system inaugurated by him works. It is simple.Authority and prestige in the Order are absolute, but while the lower grades give increase ofprivilege, the higher give increase of service. Power in the Order depends, therefore, directlyon the willingness to aid others. Tolerance also is taught in the higher grades; so that no mancan be even an Inspector of the Order unless he be equally well disposed to all classes ofopinion. You may have six wives or none; but if you have six, you are required not to letthem talk all at once, and if you have none, you are required to refrain from boring otherpeoÿle with dithyrambs upon your own virtue. This tolerance is taught by a peculiar course ofinstruction whose nature it would be imprudent as well as impertinent to disclose; I will ask"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"you to accept my word that it is efficient.With this provision, it is easy to see that intolerance and snobbery are impossible; for theexample set by members of the universally respected higher grades is against this. I may addthat members are bound together by participation in certain mysteries, which lead to asynthetic climax in which a single secret is communicated whose nature is such as to set atrest for ever all division on those fertile causes of quarrel, sex and religion. The possession ofthis secret gives the members entitled to it such calm of authority that the perfect respectwhich is their due never fails them.Thus, then, you see brethren dwelling together in unity; and you wonder whether the lust ofpossession may not cause division. On the contrary, this matter has been the excellent causeof general prosperity.In the majority of cases property is wasted. One has six houses; three remain unlet. One has20 percent of the stock of a certain company; and is frozen out by the person with 51 percent.There are a thousand dangers and drawbacks to the possession of this world's goods whichthin the hairs of those who cling to them.In the O.T.O. all this trouble is avoided. Such property as any member of the Order wills ishanded over to the Great Officers either as a gift, or in trust. In the latter case it isadministered in the interest of the donor. Property being thus pooled, immense economies areeffected. One lawyer does the work of fifty; house agents let houses instead of merely writingmisleading entries in books; the O.T.O. controls the company instead of half­a­dozen isolatedand impotent stockholders. Whatever the O.T.O. findeth to do, it does with all its might; nonedare oppose the power of a corporation thus centralised, thus ramified. To become a memberof the O.T.O. is to hitch your wagon to a star.But if you are poor? If you have no property? The O.T.O. still helps you. There will alwaysbe unoccupied houses which you can tend rent­free; there is certainty of employment, if youdesire it, from other members. If you keep a sh&127;p, you may be sure that O.T.O.members will be your customers; if you are a doctor or a lawyer, they will be your clients.Are you sick? The other members hasten to your bed to ask of what you are in need. Do youneed company? The Profess­House of the O.T.O. is open to you. Do you require a loan? TheTreasurer­General of the O.T.O. is empowered to advance to you, without interest, up to thetotal amount of your fees and subscriptions. Are you on a journey? You have the right to thehospitality of the Master of a Lodge of the O.T.O. for three days in any one place. Are youanxious to educate your children? The O.T.O. will fit them for the battle. Are you at oddswith a brother? The Grand Tribunal of the O.T.O. will arbitrate, free of charge, between you.Are you moribund? You have the power to leave the total amount that you have paid into theTreasury of the O.T.O. to whom you will. Will your children be orphan? No; for they will beadopted if you wish by the Master of your Lodge, or by the Grand Master of the O.T.O.In short, there is no circumstance of life in which the O.T.O. is not both sword and shield."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"You wonder? You reply that this can only be by generosity, by divine charity of the hightoward the low, of the rich toward the poor, of the great toward the small? You are athousand times right; you have understood the secret of the O.T.O.That such qualities can flourish in an extended community may surprise so eminent and soprofound a student of humanity as yourself; yet examples abound of practices the mostunnatural and repugnant to mankind which have continued through centuries. I need notremind you of Jaganath and of the priests of Attis, for extreme cases.A fortiori, then, it must be possible to train men to independence, to tolerance, to nobility ofcharacter, and to good manners, and this is done in the O.T.O. by certain very efficaciousmethods which (for I will not risk further wearying you) I will not describe. Besides, they aresecret. But beyond them is the supreme incentive; advancement in the Order depends almostentirely on the possession of such qualities, and is impossible without it. Power being themain desire of man, it is only necessary so to condition its possession that it be not abused.Wealth is of no account in the O.T.O. Above a certain grade all realisable property, withcertain obvious exceptions­­things in daily use, and the like­­must be vested in the O.T.O.Proÿerty may be enjoyed in accordance with the dignity of the adept of such grade, but hecannot leave it idle or sequestrate it from the common good. He may travel, for instance, as arailway magnate travels; but he cannot injure the commonwealth by setting his private carathwart the four main lines.Even intellectual eminence and executive ability are at a certain discount in the Order. Workis invariably found for persons possessing these qualifications, and they attain high status andrenown for their reward; but not advancement in the Order, unless they exhibit a talent forgovernment, and this will be exhibited far more by nobility of character, firmness and suavity,tact and dignity, high honour and good manners, those qualities (in short) which are, in thebest minds, natural predicates of the word gentleman. The knowledge of this fact not onlyinspires confidence in the younger members, but induces them to emulate their seniors.In order to appreciate the actual working of the system, it is necessary to visit our Profess­Houses. (It is hoped that some will shortly be established in the United States of America.)Some are like the castles of mediaeval barons, some are simple cottages; the same spirit rulesin all. It is that of perfect hospitality. Each one is free to do as he will; and the luxury of thisenjoyment is such that he becomes careful to avoid disturbance of the equal right of others.Yet, the authority of the Abbot of the House being supreme, any failure to observe this rule ismet with approÿriate energy. The case cannot really arise, unless circumstances are quitebeyond the ordinary; for the period of hospitality is strictly limited, and extensions dependupon the goodwill of the Abbot. Naturally, as it takes all sorts to make a world­­and werejoice in that diversity which makes our unity so exquisite a miracle­­some Profess­Houseswill suit one person, some another. And birds of a feather will learn to flock together.However, the well­being of the Order and the study of its mysteries being at the heart ofevery member of the Order, there is inevitably one common ground on which all may meet.I fear that I have exhausted your patience with this letter, and I beg you to excuse me.

Application for admission to the Order may be made personally at headquarters, betweenthe hours of Ten A.M. and Twelve Noon on week­days, or by letter to the Grand SecretaryGeneral. In the former case, applicants should be provided with the Twenty Dollars entitlingthem to the Third Degree; in the latter, it should be enclosed with the application.The First Annual Subscription is payable on taking the Third Degree; if this is taken afterJune 30 in any year, only half the amount is due.Subscriptions of old members are due on January 1, but the Brother is considered in goodstanding, and he does not lose his rights, if it is paid by March 1. Should he fail to dischargehis obligation by this date, he ceases ipso facto to be a member of the Order, but may bereinstated on paying arrears and Five Dollars extra.

Besides the free certificate of membership, special diplomas for framing are granted to allmembers at a uniform price of Ten Dollars. Special diplomas of the IX°, Twenty­five Dollars.13. The privileges of members of the O.T.O. are very numerous. These are the principal:1. They have not only access to, but instruction in, the whole body of hidden knowledgepreserved in the Sanctuary from the beginning of its manifestation.In the lower grades the final secrets are hinted and conveyed in symbol, beneath veil,and through sacrament.In this way the intelligence of the initiate is called into play, so that he who well usesthe knowledge of the lower grades may be selected for invitation to the higher, whereall things are declared openly.2. They become partakers of the current of Universal Life in Liberty, Beauty, Harmony,and Love which flames within the heart of the O.T.O., and the Light of that augustfraternity insensibly illuminates them ever more and more as they approach its centralSun.3. They meet those persons most complemental to their own natures, and find unexpectedhelp and brotherhood in the whole world wherever they may travel.4. They obtain the right to sojourn in the secret houses of the O.T.O., permanently or fora greater or lesser period of the year according to their rank in the Order; or, in the caseof those of the Fifth and lower degrees, are candidates for invitation to these houses.5. The Knowledge of the Preparation and Use of the Universal Medicine is restricted tomembers of the IX°; but it may be administered to members of the VIII° and VII° inspecial circumstances by favour of the National Grand Masters General, and even inparticular emergency to members of lower degrees.6. In the V° all members are pledged to bring immediate and perfect relief to all distress ofmind, body, or estate, in which they may find any of their fellows of that degree. In thehigher degrees the Bonds of Fraternity are still further strengthened. The Order thusaffords a perfect system of insurance against every misfortune or accident of life.7. Members of the IX° become part proprietors of the Estates and Goods of the Order, sothat the attainment of this degree implies a return with interest of the fees andsubscriptions paid.8. The Order gives practical assistance in life to worthy members of even its lowerdegrees, so that, even if originally poor, they become well able to afford thecomparatively high fees of the VII°, VIII°, and IX°. On exaltation to the IV° eachCompanion may file an account of his circumstances, and state in what direction herequires help.14.

Yet with our Order every duty is also a"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"privilege, so that it is impossible wholly to separate them.OF THE DUTIES OF THE BRETHRENFIRST HOUSE1. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. Yet it is well for Brethren to study daily in theVolume of the Sacred Law, Liber Legis, for therein is much counsel concerning this, howbest they may carry out this will.SECOND HOUSE2. The private purse of every Brother should always be at the disposal of any Brother whomay be in need. But in such a case it is a great mischief if the one ask, and the other consent;for if the former be really in need, his pride is wounded by his asking; and if not, the door isopened to beggars and imposters, and all manner of arrant knaves and rogues such as are notrue Brethren. But the Brother who is possessed of this world's goods should make it hisbusiness to watch the necessity of all those Brethren with whom he may be personallyacquainted, anticipating their wants in so wise and kindly and delicate a manner that it shallappear as if it were the payment of a debt. And what help is given shall be given withdiscretion, so that the relief may be permanent rather than temporary.3. All Brethren shall be exceedingly punctual in the payment of Lodge Dues. This is to takeprecedence of all other calls upon the purse.THIRD HOUSE4. The Brethren shall be diligent in preaching the Law of Thelema. In all writings they shallbe careful to use the prescribed greetings; likewise in speech, even with strangers.5. They shall respond heartily to every summons of the Lodge or Chapter to which they maybelong, not lightly making excuse.6. Brethren should use every opportunity of assisting each other in their tastes, businesses, orprofessions, whether by direct dealing with Brethren in preference to others, or by speakingwell of them, or as may suggest itself. It seems desirable, when possible, that where two ormore Brethren of the same Lodge are engaged in the same work, they should seek toamalgamate the same by entering into partnership. Thus in time great and powerfulcorporations may arise from small individual enterprises.7. They shall be diligent in circulating all tracts, manifestos, and all other communicationswhich the Order may from time to time give out for the instruction or emancipation of theprofane.8. They may offer suitable books and pictures to the Libraries of the Profess­Houses of theOrder."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"FOURTH HOUSE9. Every Brother who may possess mines, land, or houses more than he can himselfconstantly occupy, should donate part of such mines or land, or one or more of such housesto the Order.10. Property thus given will be administered if he desire it in his own interest, thus effecting asaving, since large estates are more economically handled than small. But the Order will usesuch property as may happen to lie idle for the moment in such ways as it may seem good,lending an unlet house (for example) to some Brother who is in need, or allowing an unusedhall to be occupied by a Lodge.11. (Yet in view of the great objects of the Order, endowment is welcome.)12. Every Brother shall show himself solicitous of the comfort and happiness of any Brotherwho may be old, attending not only to all material wants, but to his amusement, so that hisdeclining years may be made joyful.FIFTH HOUSE13. Every Brother shall seek constantly to give pleasure to all Brethren with whom he isacquainted, whether by entertainment or conversation, or in any other manner that maysuggest itself. It will frequently and naturally arise that love itself springs up betweenmembers of the Order, for that they have so many and sacred interests in common. Such loveis peculiarly holy, and is to be encouraged.14. All children of Brethren are to be considered as children of the whole Order, and to beprotected and aided in every way by its members severally, as by its organization collectively.No distinction is to be made with regard to the conditions surrounding the birth of any child.15. There is an especially sacred duty, which every Brother should fulfil, with regard to allchildren, those born without the Order included. This duty is to instruct them in the Law ofThelema, to teach them independence and freedom of thought and character, and to warnthem that servility and cowardice are the most deadly diseases of the human soul.SIXTH HOUSE16. Personal or domestic attendants should be chosen from among the members of the Orderwhen possible, and great tact and courtesy are to be employed in dealing with them.17. They, on their part, will render willing and intelligent service.18. While in Lodge, and on special occasions, they are to be treated as Brothers, with perfectequality; such behaviour is undesirable during the hours of service, and familiarity, subversiveas it is of all discipline and order, is to be avoided by adopting a complete and marked changeof manner and address."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"19. This applies to all persons in subordinate positions, but not to the Brethren Servient in theProfess­Houses of the Order, who, giving service without recompense, are to be honoured ashosts.20. In case of the sickness of any Brother, it is the duty of all Brethren who know himpersonally to attend him, to see that he want for nothing, and to report if necessary his needsto the Lodge, or to Grand Lodge itself.21. Those Brethren who happen to be doctors or nurses will naturally give their skill and carewith even more than their customary joy in service.22. All Brethren are bound by their fealty to offer their service in their particular trade,business, or profession, to the Grand Lodge. For example, a stationer will supply GrandLodge with paper, vellum, and the like; a bookseller offer any books to the Library of GrandLodge which the Librarian may desire to possess; a lawyer will execute any legal business forGrand Lodge, and a railway or steamship owner or director see to it that the Great Officerstravel in comfort wherever they may wish to go.23. Visitors from other Lodges are to be accorded the treatment of ambassadors; this willapply most especially to Sovereign Grand Inspector Generals of the Order on their tours ofinspection. All hospitality and courtesy shown to such is shown to Ourselves, not to themonly.SEVENTH HOUSE24. It is desirable that the marriage partner of any Brother should also be a member of theOrder. Neglect to insist upon this leads frequently to serious trouble for both parties,especially the uninitiate.25. Lawsuits between members of the Order are absolutely forbidden, on pain of immediateexpulsion and loss of all privileges, even of those accumulated by past good conduct referredto in the second part of this instruction.26. All disputes between Brethren should be referred firstly to the Master or Masters of theirLodge or Lodges in conference; if a composition be not arrived at in this manner, the disputeis to be referred to the Grand Tribunal, which will arbitrate thereon, and its decision is to beaccepted as final.27. Refusal to apply for or accept such decision shall entail expulsion from the Order, and theother party is then at liberty to seek his redress in the Courts of Profane Justice.28. Members of the Order are to regard those without its pale as possessing no rights of anykind, since they have not accepted the Law, and are therefore, as it were, troglodytes,survivals of a past civilisation, and to be treated accordingly. Kindness should be showntowards them, as towards any other animal, and every effort should be made to bring theminto Freedom."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"29. Any injury done by any person without the Order to any person within it may be broughtbefore the Grand Tribunal, which will, if it deem right and fit, use all its power to redress orto avenge it.30. In the case of any Brother being accused of an offence against the criminal law of thecountry in which he resides, so that any other Brother cognisant of the fact feels bound inself­defence to bring accusation, he shall report the matter to the Grand Tribunal as well as tothe Civil Authority, claiming exemption on this ground.31. The accused Brother will, however, be defended by the Order to the utmost of its poweron his affirming his innocence upon the Volume of the Sacred Law in the Ordeal appointedad hoc by the Grand Tribunal itself.32. Public enemies of the country of any Brother shall be treated as such while in the field,and slain or captured as the officer of the Brother may command. But within the precincts ofthe Lodge all such divisions are to be forgotten absolutely; and as children of One Father theenemies of the hour before and the hour after are to dwell in peace, amity, and fraternity.EIGHTH HOUSE33. Every Brother is expected to bear witness in his last will and testament to the great benefitthat he hath received from the Order by bestowing upon it part or the whole of his goods, ashe may deem fit.34. The death of a Brother is not to be an occasion of melancholy, but of rejoicing; theBrethren of his Lodge shall gather together and make a banquet with music and dancing andall manner of gladness. It is of the greatest importance that this shall be done, for thereby theinherited fear of death which is deep­seated as instinct in us will gradually be rooted out. It isa legacy from the dead aeon of Osiris, and it is our duty to kill it in ourselves that our childrenand our children's children may be born free from the curse.NINTH HOUSE35. Every Brother is expected to spend a great part of his spare time in the study of theprinciples of the Law and of the Order, and in searching out the key to its great and manifoldmysteries.36. He should also do all in his power to spread the Law, especially taking long journeys,when possible, to remote places, there to sow the seed of the Law.TENTH HOUSE37. All pregnant women are especially sacred to members of the Order, and no effort shouldbe spared to bring them to acceptance of the Law of Freedom, so that the unborn may benefitby that impression. They should be induced to become members of the Order, so that thechild may be born under its aegis."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"38. If the mother that is to be have asserted her will to be so in contempt and defiance of theTabus of the slave­gods, she is to be regarded as especially suitable to our Order, and theMaster of the Lodge in her district shall offer to become, as it were, godfather to the child,who shall be trained specially, if the mother so wishes, as a servant of the Order, in one of itsProfess­Houses.39. Special Profess­Houses for the care of women of the Order, or those whose husbands orlovers are members of the Order, will be instituted, so that the frontal duty of womankindmay be carried out in all comfort and honour.40. Every Brother is expected to use all his influence with persons in a superior station of life(so called) to induce them to joint the Order. Royal personages, ministers of State, highofficials in the Diplomatic, Naval, Military, and Civil Services are particularly to be soughtafter, for it is intended ultimately that the temporal power of the State be brought into theLaw, and led into freedom and prosperity by the application of its principles.41. Colleges of the Order will presently be established where the children of its members maybe trained in all trades, businesses, and professions, and there they may study the liberal artsand humane letters, as well as our holy and arcane science. Brethren are expected to do all intheir power to make possible the establishment of such Universities.ELEVENTH HOUSE42. Every Brother is expected to do all in his power to induce his personal friends to acceptthe Law and join the Order. He should therefore endeavor to make new friends outside theOrder, for the purpose of widening its sc&127;pe.TWELFTH HOUSE43. The Brethren are bound to secrecy only with regard to the nature of the rituals of ourOrder, and to our words, signs, etc. The general principles of the Order may be fullyexplained, so far as they are understood below the VIø; as it is written, ``The ordeals I writenot: the rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the Law is for all.'' It is to be observedthat punctual performance of these duties, so that the report thereof is noised abroad and thefame of it cometh even unto the Throne of the Supreme and Holy King himself, will weighheavily in the scale when it comes to be a question of the high advancement of a Brother inthe Order.OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE BRETHRENFIRST HOUSE44. The first and greatest of all privileges of a Brother is to be a Brother; to have accepted theLaw, to have become free and independent, to have destroyed all fear, whether of custom, orof faith, or of other men, or of death itself. In other papers the joy and glory of those whohave accepted The Book of the Law as the sole rule of life is largely, though never fully,explained; and we will not here recapitulate the same."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"SECOND HOUSE45. All Brethren who may fall into indigence have a right to the direct assistance of the Orderup to the full amount of fees and subscriptions paid by them up to the time of application.This will be regarded as a loan, but no interest will be charged upon it. That this privilegemay not be abused, the Grand Tribunal will decide whether or no such application is made ingood faith.THIRD HOUSE46. Members of the Order will be permitted to use the Library in any of our Profess­Houses.47. Circulating Libraries will presently be established.48. Brethren who may be travelling have a right to the hospitality of the Master of the Lodgeof the district for a period of three days.FOURTH HOUSE49. Brethren of all grades may be invited to sojourn in the Profess­Houses of the Order byGrand Lodge; and such invitation may confidently be expected as the reward of merit. Therethey will be able to make the personal acquaintance of members of the higher Grades, learnof the deeper workings of the Order, obtain the benefit of personal instruction, and in all waysfit themselves for advancement.50. Brethren of advanced years and known merit who desire to follow the religious life maybe asked to reside permanently in such houses.51. In the higher degrees Brethren have the right to reside in our Profess­Houses for a portionof every year, as shown:VI°. Two weeks.VII°. Two months.G.T. One month.S.G.C. Three months.P.R.S. Six weeks.VIII°. Six months.52. Members of the IX°, who share among themselves the whole property of the Orderaccording to the rules of that degree, may, of course, reside there permanently. Indeed, thehouse of every Brother of this grade is, ipso facto, a Profess­House of the Order.FIFTH HOUSE53. All Brethren may expect the warmest co­operation in their pleasures and amusementsfrom other members of the Order. The perfect freedom and security afforded by the Lawallows the characters of all Brethren to expand to the very limits of their nature, and the greatjoy and gladness with which they are constantly overflowing make them the best ofcompanions. ``They shall rejoice, our chosen; who sorroweth is not of us. Beauty and"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.''54. Children of all Brethren are entitled to the care of the Order, and arrangements will bemade to educate them in certain of the Profess­Houses of the Order.55. Children of Brethren who are left orphans will be officially adoÿted by the Master of hisLodge, or if the latter decline, by the Supreme Holy King himself, and treated in all ways as ifthey were his own.56. Brethren who have a right to some especial interest in any child whose mother is not amember of the Order may recommend it especially to the care of their lodges or of GrandLodge.SIXTH HOUSE57. In sickness all Brethren have the right to medical or surgical care and attendance from anyBrethren of the Lodge who may be physicians, surgeons, or nurses.58. In special necessity the Supreme Holy King will send his own attendants.59. Where circumstances warrant it, in cases of lives of great value to the Order and the like,he may even permit the administration of that secret Medicine which is known to members ofthe IX°.60. Members of the Order may expect Brethren to busy themselves in finding remunerativeoccupation for them, where they lack it, or, if possible, to employ them personally.SEVENTH HOUSE61. Members of the Order may expect to find suitable marriage partners in the extremelyselect body to which they belong. Community of interest and hope being already established,it is natural to suppose that where mutual attraction also exists, a marriage will result in perfecthappiness. (There are special considerations in this matter which apply to the VII° and cannotbe discussed in this place.)62. As explained above, Brethren are entirely free of most legal burdens, since lawsuits arenot permitted within the Order, and since they may call upon the legal advisers of the Orderto defend them against their enemies in case of need.EIGHTH HOUSE63. All Brethren are entitled after death to the proper disposal of their remains according tothe rites of the Order and their grade in it.64. If the Brother so desire, the entire amount of the fees and subscriptions which he has paidduring his life will be handed over by the Order to his heirs and legatees. The Order thusaffords an absolute system of insurance in addition to its other benefits."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"NINTH HOUSE65. The Order teaches the only perfect and satisfactory system of philosoÿhy, religion, andscience, leading its members step by step to knowledge and power hardly even dreamed ofby the profane.66. Brethren of the Order who take long journeys overseas are received in places where theysojourn at the Profess­Houses of the Order for the period of one month.TENTH HOUSE67. Women of the Order who are about to become mothers receive all care, attention, andhonour from all Brethren.68. Special Profess­Houses will be established for their convenience, should they wish to takeadvantage of them.69. The Order offers great social advantages to its members, bringing them as it does intoconstant association with men and women of high rank.70. The Order offers extraordinary opportunities to its members in their trades, businesses, orprofessions, aiding them by co­oÿeration, and securing them clients or customers.ELEVENTH HOUSE71. The Order offers friendship to its members, bringing together men and women of similarcharacter, taste, and aspiration.TWELFTH HOUSE72. The secrecy of the Order provides it members with an inviolable shroud of concealment.73. The crime of slander, which causes so great a proportion of human misery, is renderedextremely dangerous, if not impossible, within the Order by a clause in the Obligation of theThird Degree.74. The Order exercises its whole power to relieve its members of any constraint to whichthey may be subjected, attacking with vigour any person or persons who may endeavour tosubject them to compulsion, and in all other ways aiding in the complete emancipation of theBrethren from aught that may seek to restrain them from doing That Which They Will.It is to be observed that these privileges being so vast, it is incumbent upon the honour ofevery Brother not to abuse them, and the sponsors of any Brother who does so, as well as hehimself, will be held strictly to account by the Grand Tribunal. The utmost frankness andgood faith between Brethren is essential to the easy and harmonious working of our system,and the Executive Power will see to it that these are encouraged by all means possible, andthat breach of them is swiftly and silently suppressed."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Love is the law, love under will.Our fatherly benediction, and the Blessing of the All­Father in the Outer and the Inner beupon you.BAPHOMET X° O.T.O., IRELAND, IONA, AND ALL THE BRITAINS"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"BAPHOMET XI°Liber CXCIV{Book 194}O. T. O.An Intimationwith Reference to theConstitution of the OrderThis Intimation is presently being implemented in the United States­­ the most significantrecent development was the institution of the Electoral College. Unlike the Constitutionproper, which has a decidedly international emphasis, most of its clauses govern nationaloperations. This Intimation should be closely studied in conjunction with the Constitution,the Open Letter and other relevant papers published in this volume by those who areconcerned with the future direction of the O.T.O., in the United States and abroad. It firstappeared in The Equinox III(1) (Detroit: Universal, 1919). Paragraph numbers have beensupplied for reference purposes, and it is followed by a synthetic, diagrammatic representationof the Intimations prepared by the New York Constitutional Study Group.­­H.B.Issued by Order: BAPHOMET XI° O.T.O., HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUMBRITANNIARUM, REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUSANY PROVINCE OF THE O.T.O. is governed by the Grand Master and those to whom hedelegates his authority, until such time as the Order is established, which is the case when itpossesses eleven or more Profess­Houses in the province. Then the regular constitution isautomatically promulgated. The quotation is slightly adapted from an address in one of therituals.1. This is the Constitution and Government of our Holy Order; by the study of its Balanceyou may yourself come to apprehension of how to rule your own life. For, in True Things, all"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"are but images one of another; man is but a map of the universe, and Society is but the sameon a larger scale.2. Learn then that our Holy Order has but Three True Grades; as it is written in The Book ofthe Law: The Hermit, The Lover, and the Man of Earth.3. It is but for convenience that these grades have been separated into Three Triads.4. The Third Triad consists of the degrees from Minerval to Prince of Jerusalem. TheMinerval degree is a Prologue to the First; the degrees subsequent to the Third but pendantsto it. In this, the Man of Earth series, there are then but Three Degrees; and these Three areOne.5. The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of the Order; for he is not yet calledupon to give his life to it in service; and with us Government is Service, and nothing else. TheMan of Earth is therefore in much the position of the Plebian in Rome in the time ofMenenius Agrippa. But there is this marked difference; that every Man of Earth isencouraged and expected to push on to the next stage. In order that the feelings of the generalbody may be represented, the Men of Earth choose four persons, two men and two women,from among themselves, to stand continually before the face of the Father, the Supreme andHoly King, serving him day and night. These persons must not be of higher rank than theSecond Degree; they must volunteer for this service at the conclusion of that ceremony; andtherefore they give up their own prospect of advancement in the Order for one year, that theymay serve their fellows. This is then the first lesson in our great principle, the attainment ofhonour through renunciation.6. The degree of Knights of the East and West is but a bridge between the first and secondseries; but it is important, for in that grade a new pledge­form must be signed, and the newKnight vowed to devote his life to the Establishment of the Law of Thelema.7. The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that concerns the Social welfare ofthe Order. This grade is symbolically that of beauty and harmony; it is the naturalst&127;pping­place of the majority of men and women; for to proceed farther, as will appear,involves renunciation of the sternest kind. Here then is all joy, peace, well­being on allplanes; the Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower, andforms a natural link between them. Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on high!8. In this degree the Most Wise Sovereign of each chapter will appoint a committee of fourpersons, two men and two women, to arrange for all social gatherings, banquets, dances, theperformance of plays, and similar pleasures. They will also endeavour to promote harmonyamong the Brethren in all possible ways, and to compose any disputes by tact and friendlinesswithout formal appeal being made to any more authoritative tribunal.9. The next grade, that which lies between the Fifth and Sixth Degrees, is called the Senate.This is the first of the governing bodies, properly speaking, and here we begin to insist uponRenunciation. For within this body is the Electoral College of the O.T.O."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"10. The principle of popular election is a fatal folly; its results are visible in every so­calleddemocracy. The elected man is always the mediocrity; he is the safe man, the sound man, theman who displeases the majority less than any other; and therefore never the genius, the manof progress and illumination.11. This electoral college consists of Eleven Persons in each country. It has full control of theaffairs of the Men of Earth, appointing Lodge Masters at will. It has however no authorityover the Chapters of Rose Croix.12. Persons who wish to be appointed to this College by the Supreme and Holy King mustvolunteer for the office. The appointment is for Eleven Years. Volunteers must renounce forthat period all further progress in the Order. They must give evidence of first­rate ability ini(i) Some branch of athletics.(ii) Some branch of learning.13. They must also possess a profound general knowledge of history and of the art ofgovernment, with some attention to philosophy in general.14. They must each live in solitude, without more than the necessary speech even to casualneighbours, serving themselves in all respects, for three months continuously, once at least inevery two years. The President will summon them at the four seasons of the year, and ifnecessary at other times, when they will deliberate upon the affairs placed in their charge. Allapplications to pass to the Fifth Degree must receive their sanction. Appeal from theirdecisions may however be made to the Supreme Council.15. The Sixth Degree is an executive or military body, and represents the temporal power ofthe Supreme and Holy King. Each member is amenable to military discipline. Singly or inconcert with his comrades, each Knight is vowed to enforce the decisions of authority.16. The Grade of Grand Inquisitor Commander follows. Here every member has the right toa seat on the Grand Tribunal, which body decides all disputes and complaints which have notbeen composed by the Chapters of Rose Croix or the Lodge Masters. Its verdicts are withoutappeal, unless a member of the Electoral College give sanction to take the case to theAreopagus of the Eighth Degree. All members of the Order, even of higher grades, aresubject to the Grand Tribunal.17. The next grade is that of Prince of the Royal Secret. Every member of this degree isdevoted to the Propagation of the Law in a very special manner; for this grade is the first inwhich the Beginning of the Inmost Secret is declared openly. He will therefore, by hispersonal exertions, induce one hundred and eleven persons to join the Order, before he mayproceed to the Seventh Degree, except by special order from the Supreme and Holy King.18. The Seventh Degree is, in military language, the Great General Staff of the Army of theSixth Degree. From its members the Supreme and Holy King appoints a Supreme GrandCouncil."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"19. This Council is charged with the government of the whole of the Second Triad, orLovers. All members of the Seventh Degree travel as Sovereign Grand Inspectors General ofthe Order, and report, on their own initiative, to the Supreme and Most Holy King, as to thecondition of all Lodges, and Chapters; to the Supreme Council, on all affairs of the SecondTriad; and to the Electoral College, on those of the Third.20. The Eighth Degree is a Philosophical Body. Its members being fully instructed in thePrinciples of the Order, save in one point only, devote themselves to the understanding ofwhat they have learned in their initiation. They have power to reverse the decisions of theGrand Tribunal, and to compose all conflicts between any of the governing bodies. And thisthey do upon the great principles of philosophy. For it will often occur that there is contentionbetween two parties, both of whom are right from their own point of view. This is soimportant that an illustration is desirable. A man is smitten with leprosy; is it right that menshould circumscribe his liberty by isolating him from his fellows? Another holds back land orsome other necessity from the common use; is he to be compelled to surrender it? Such casesof difficulty involve deep philosophical principles; and the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree ischarged with the duty of resolving them in accordance with the great principles of the Order.21. Before the face of the Areoÿagus stands an independent Parliament of the Guilds. Withinthe Order, irrespective of grade, the members of each craft, trade, science, or profession formthemselves into a Guild, make their own laws, and prosecute their own good, in all matterspertaining to their labour and means of livelihood. Each Guild chooses the man most eminentin it to represent it before the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree; and all disputes between thevarious Guilds are argued before that Body, which will decide according to the grandprinciples of the Order. Its decisions pass for ratification to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, andthence to the Throne.22. Epopts and Pontiffs of this exalted grade are bound to live in isolation for fourconsecutive months in every year, meditating the mysteries revealed to them.23. The Ninth Degree­­the Sanctuary of the Gnosis­­is synthetic. The prime duty of itsmembers is to study and practise the theurgy and thaumaturgy of the grade; but in additionthey must be prepared to act as direct representatives of the Supreme and Most Holy King,radiating his light upon the whole world. Yet, from the nature of their initiation, they mustveil their glory in a cloud of darkness. They move unseen and unrecognized among theyoungest of us, subtly and loftily leading us into the holy ineffable mysteries of the TrueLight.24. The Supreme and Most Holy King is appointed by the O.H.O. His is the ultimateresponsibility for all within his holy kingdom. The succession to the high office of O.H.O. isdecided in a manner not here to be declared; but this you may learn, O Brother Magician, thathe may be chosen even from the grade of a Minerval. And herein lieth a most sacredMystery.25. The Electoral College possesses one most singular power. Every eleven years, or in thecase of a vacancy occurring, they choose two persons from the Ninth Degree, who are"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"charged with the duty of Revolution.26. It is the business of these persons constantly to criticise and oÿpose the acts of theSupreme and Most Holy King, whether or no they personally approve of them. Should heexhibit weakness, bodily, mental, or moral, they are empowered to appeal to the O.H.O. todepose him; but they, alone of all the members of the Order, are not eligible to theSuccession.27. The O.H.O., as the supreme authority in the Order, will act, in such an emergency, as hemay see fit. He may himself be removed from office, but only by the unanimous vote of allthe members of the Tenth Degree.28. Of the Eleventh Degree, its powers, privileges, and qualifications, nothing whatever issaid in any grade. It has no relation to the general plan of the Order, is inscrutable, and dwellsin its own Palaces.29. There are certain important financial obligations in various grades.30. The Electoral College of the Senate is vowed to poverty. All property, earnings, orsalaries are vested in or paid over to the Grand Treasurer General. The members subsist onthe charity of the Order, which is extended to them in accordance with their original rank inlife.31. These remarks apply equally to the Supreme Grand Council, and all higher degrees.32. In the Seventh Degree it is a qualification to vest some real property in the Order; and noone is admitted to this grade without this preliminary.33. Those members of the Order who have given all to it must obtain the money for theirinitiation fees and subscriptions from the Third Triad, whose honour is thus concerned in theunselfish support of those who have abandoned all for their sakes.34. The Grand Treasurer General is appointed by the Supreme and Most Holy King; he maybe a member of any grade whatever; but he must, on accepting office, take the vow ofpoverty. His authority is absolute in all financial matters; but he is responsible to, and may beremoved at will by, the Supreme and Most Holy King. He will appoint a committee to assisthim and advise him in his work; and he will usually select one person from each of thegoverning bodies of the Order.Such is a brief outline of the government of the O.T.O. It combines monarchy withdemocracy; it includes aristocracy, and conceals even the seeds of revolution, by which aloneprogress can be effected.

CONSTITUTION of the ANCIENT Order of Oriental Templars.IntroductionLET IT BE KNOWN that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient Orderof sages, whose object is the amelioration and spiritual evolution of mankind by meansof conquering error and aiding men and women in their efforts of attaining the power ofrecognising the truth. This Order has existed already in the most remote times and ithas manifested its activity secretly and openly in the world under different names and invarious forms: it has caused social and political revolutions and proved to be the rock ofsalvation in times of danger and misfortune. It has always upheld the banner offreedom against tyranny in whatever shape this appeared, whether as clerical orpolitical or social despotism or oppression of any kind.To this \"secret order\" every wise and spiritually enlightened person belongs by right ofhis or her nature: because they all, even if they are personally unknown to each other,are one in their purpose and object and they all work under the guidance of the one lightof truth. Into this Sacred Society no one can be admitted by another unless he has thepower to enter it himself by virtue of his own interior illumination, neither can anyoneafter he has once entered be expelled unless he should expel himself by becomingunfaithful to his principles and forget again the truths which he has learned by his ownexperience.All this is known to every enlightened person.But it is known only to few that there exists also an external, visible organisation ofsuch men and women, who having themselves found the path to real self-knowledge,and who having travelled the burning sands, are willing to give to others, desirous ofentering that path, the benefit of their experience, and to act as spiritual guides to thosewho are willing to be guided.While numberless societies, associations, orders, groups, etc., have been foundedduring the last thirty years in all parts of the civilised world, all following some line ofoccult study, yet there is but ONE ancient organization of genuine Mystics which showsto the seeker after truth a Royal Road to discover the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity and tothe Unveiling of the One Hermetic Truth.This organization is known at the present time as the:Ancient Order of Oriental TemplarsOrdo Templi OrientisOtherwise: The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light.It is a Modern School of Magic. And, like the ancient schools of magic, it derived itsknowledge from the East. This knowledge was never revealed to the profane, for it gaveimmense power for either good or evil to its possessors. It was recorded in symbol,parable and allegory, requiring a Key for its interpretation.The symbols and glyphs of Freemasonry were originally also derived from the moreancient mysteries.PublicationsPublications ProjectBook ReviewsReview GuidelinesEssential DocumentsC.P.M.

While the MoEinitiations are designed in such a manner that they can be performed without any magicalknowledge, ignorance of their magical function is the root cause of many unnecessaryproblems for the initiate.Simple MagickThe main magical function of the MoE initiations is not an Order secret--it is simply explainedin an essay by Frater Ad Veritatem IX ̊:“The Order Degrees, as described in several Order documents included in this issue, areconveyed in a ceremonial manner. The Degree structure corresponds with the HinduChakra system as diagrammed elsewhere in this issue. Thus, the Man of Earth series ofdegrees fully activates the psychic body of the Initiate.”These correspondences are as follows:Crown (Sahasrara): Perfect InitiateThird Eye (Ajna): Minerval & IV ̊Throat (Vishuddha): I ̊Heart (Anahata): II ̊Plexus (Manipura): IV ̊Navel (Svadisthana): III ̊Root (Muladhara): MinervalThere is a logical pattern in the progression of the degrees through the chakras. The Minervaldegree establishes the primary circuit, activating the Root and Third Eye chakras. The nextthree degrees (I-III ̊) descend down down the spine, activating the Throat, Heart, and Navelchakras. The Fourth degree activates the Plexus chakra, completing the circuit set up in theMinerval, and then re-activates the Third Eye to affirm and strengthen the circuit. The Crownchakra is opened only after all of the lower chakras are activated.The MoE degrees are open to all worthy candidates because the series activates all sevenchakras. To activate only part of the psychic body of the initiate would be a travesty and acrime.The MoE initiations are formulaic in nature, much like the Gnostic Mass (the other main ritual"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"function the OTO). Like the Priest and Priestess in the Gnostic Mass, who can perform the IX ̊operation without knowing the secret of the degree, the MoE initiator need not understand themechanics of the ritual in order to perform it successfully. No magical training is received withthe Charter to initiate and no great secrets are imparted. The recipe nature of the MoEinitiations is one of the main reasons why the OTO strives so hard keep their scripts out ofpublic hands—anyone can perform them and get results.Complex SystemIf the magick of the MoE initiations is so simple and formulaic, why do the results of theseceremonies differ so greatly from candidate to candidate? Why is one initiate deeply affectedby a particular initiation while another initiate escapes unscathed? The answer lies in how thechakra system works.Ideally, the seven chakras are equally balanced and work in synergy, allowing the individual tolive and experience life to the fullest of his or her potential. Realistically, by the time theindividual has reached the “full age” of 18 and is eligible for initiation into the OTO, he or shehas had several negative life experiences resulting in one or more blocked chakras. What is ablocked chakra? Anodea Judith gives us a comprehensive explanation in Eastern Body,Western Mind:“We have all experienced times when the free flow of our energy or intention seemsblocked. Habitual blocks may fall into categories that relate to chakra function. Forinstance, if communication is difficult for us, we have a block in the fifth chakra. If welive in fear and submission, we could say our power chakra is blocked. If our physicalhealth or personal finances are in constant crisis, then we have a block in the firstchakra.What blocks a chakra? Childhood trauma, cultural conditioning, limited belief systems,restrictive or exhausting habits, physical and emotional injuries, or even just a lack ofattention all contribute to chakra blockage. Difficulties abound in life, and for each one,we develop a coping strategy. When difficulties persist, these coping strategies becomechronic patterns, anchored in the body and psyche as defense structures.Eventually these defenses create holding patterns in our musculature that restrict thefree flow of energy, even when real threats cease to exist. This chronic tension is knownas body armor. It affects our posture, breathing, metabolism, and our emotional states,as well as our perceptions, interpretations, and belief systems. Obviously, since thebody-mind system is so affected, we see manifestations in our relationships, work,creativity, and belief systems--all of which tend to perpetuate the pattern.As the life experiences of each individual are unique, he or she will have a unique relationshipof healthy and blocked chakras. The general theme of the each chakra is the same, but therelationship and expression will always be different. For instance, the throat chakra governscommunication, but a blockage in one individual may manifest as aggressive and constantconversation, while another may simply stop talking anytime there is any form of conflict.Therefore each individual will be affected by the MoE intitations in a unique and personalmanner.Initiation is not a universal panacea. A three-hour ceremony by itself cannot undo years ofnegative programming. Activation of a blocked chakra may open it to the process of change"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"and healing, but the energy may not be strong enough to overcome the blockage.Allow me give you a personal example. I was diagnosed with Leukemia at age 7, and within afew weeks the aggresive chemotherapy and radiation treatments turned an energetic little boyinto an extremely weak and fragile child. I coped with this trauma by withdrawing from mybody, effectively distancing myself from the constant pain and suffering.When I went into a full remission eight years later, this defense structure was completelyintegrated into my psyche. Thus, when I took my Minerval initiation at age 25 I was relativelyunaffected by the experience, as my root chakra had been blocked for over half my life. It wasonly many years later that I recognized this blockage and started to work through it.The process of initiation is like planting a seed. If the seed is buried in fertile ground and giventhe proper amount of water and sunlight, it will grow into a beautiful flower and bear muchfruit. On the other hand, if the seed is cast amidst the rocks and parched by the harsh sun ofthe desert, it will quickly wither and die.There is a fundamental magical principle at work here: magick is much more effective whenyou work with it rather than against it. If you perform a magical ritual to get laid, you aremore likely to see results if you go out and socialize in public than if you stay at home. If youdo magick to help you pass a test in school, you will be much more likely to succeed if youstudy for the test instead of sitting on the couch watching TV. Likewise, if you work with thecurrent of initiation rather than just letting it happen, you are much more likely to receive thefull benefit of that initiation.In conclusion, knowledge of the magical function of the MoE initations and their foundation inthe chakra system is the key to understanding any problems that may occur as a result of thoseinitiations. By working with the current of initiation to overcome blockages in the chakrasystem, the initiate may truly take advantage of all that the MoE degrees have to offer.

Prospectus This ''prospectus'' is republished from the Agapé Lodge Oriflamme I(2) published in Pasadena,California in 1944 E.V.­­it is generally a paraphrase of other O.T.O. documents, and was verylikely written by Wilfred Talbot Smith, Frater 132, Ramaka X° and the founding Master ofAgapé Lodge in Southern California. It provides a concise summary of the aims and origins ofthe Order, with certain of the advantages of membership highlighted. As remarked elsewhere,certain of these ''advantages'' are under review. The policy permitting the borrowing of fulldues is not at present in effect, for example, nor are there formal guidelines for the care ofchildren of deceased or incapacitated members of the Order. However, these practices were ineffect as recently as the 1950s. For example, Frater Superior Saturnus extended financial aid(up to the amount of dues paid) to Frater Hymenaeus Alpha when the latter was completing hisgraduate studies at the University of California. Also, members of the O.T.O. arranged for thecare of Baphomet XI°'s natural son, Aleister Ataturk, in California.­­H.B.

Be itfurther resolved that Our own powers be, during the period of reconstruction, concentrated ina single dictator. Be it further resolved that the whole symbolism of Free Masonry, and itsname, be disused, that the true traditional knowledge be communicated in hieroglyphsunmistakably significant, although with the proper guards, in Rituals of first rate literary anddramatic merit, and so constructed that they shall require neither a gathering of many men norexpensive elaborations for their operation. The Rituals, herewith submitted, are offered,subject to modifications made by the author in such sense as the Council may deem necessary,as illustrations of the proposed work up to the Third Degree.

The Equinox will carry selections from his unpublished writings in future issues.­­H.B.LET US EXAMINE THE TREE OF LIFE again in order that we may further grasp itsmystery, and how it comes about that the New Aeon is possible in Human Consciousness.We must use the language of time and space, but we shall be informed of the Spirit if ourminds are open to the Truth.Horus, the Ever­Coming Son, is said to have appeared under many forms, as the Great Cycleof the Precession of the Equinoxes progressed. The Complete Cycle is said to be 25,868years; though in more ancient reckoning it was 26,000 years, when the year was taken torepresent 360 days. 2,155 years represents one Sign of the Grand Zodiac, and every 2,155years Horus appears in a new guise. About 11,030 B.C. he would have appeared in the Signof Leo, as the Lion God. If we examine the position of this Path on the Tree, we find it unitesTiphereth and Netzach. It is my opinion that the consciousness of Humanity during thatperiod would be particularly influenced by that Path, and that the flower of the race could nothave held conceptions above Tiphereth. They may have obtained a glimpse of the Sun asRuler of the Elements. About 8,875 B.C., Horus would manifest through Cancer, as theBeetle, and the summit of Humanconsciousness would be lowered. Thus, the age would seem one of retrogression, untilHorus, dipping down to Yesod, re­ascended under the Moon's Influence thus enteringGemini. This seems indicated in the Tarot Trump ''The Moon'' where we notice the Beetlecoming up from the Pool beneath the Moon. About 6,720 B.C. he entered Gemini andappeared as one of the Twins. Consciousness would balance that of the Leo period, and tendto ascend to Tiphereth.In 4,565 B.C. Horus entered Taurus, appearing as a Calf. Moses seemed to consider theworship of the Calf a retrogression, and we see that the Path of Taurus is again belowTiphereth. In 2,410 B.C. we find Him appearing in Aries, as the Lamb. This represented adistinct rise in the Race Consciousness, which however took on the Strong but Severe aspectof Geburah. This period was a Natural One, for the Consellation Aries, would coincide withthe Sign of Aries in the Earth's Aura or Elliptic. The conflicting Time Cycles would be"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"reconciled. Then in 255 B.C. we find him as the Fish, the Path balancing that of Aries, andhaving the Influence of Mercy predominating. Thus it was till 1900 A.D. when He appearedto enter Aquarius. But what a startling change. Suddenly we find Him on a Path uniting theSupernals of Wisdom and Understanding, and Their direct Influence made possible in theMinds of the Race. Not since the previous Golden Age 25,000 years ago had the Influence ofthis Path been felt. No wonder men looked to the Sun as the Father, and even in the Piscesperiod only understood the lower Aspect of Jupiter. Once again in this Aeon we are able torecognize the Great Mother of the Stars, and to discover the Secret of the Lost Father.There is also a Trinitarian Cycle of Father, Mother, Child, running parallel, so to speak, withthis Tradition of the Evercoming Horus. It is the Natural Formula of Isis, Osiris, Horus, and isof Solar Origin. From 2,419 B.C. to 255 B.C. Isis the Mother was said to be the PredominantAspect of the Trinity. Hers was the Office of Nature. She presided over the Natural openingof the Great and Little Years which both coincided. Then Osiris, Dead and Re­arisen, wasthe predominant object of Worship till 1900 A.D., and self­sacrifice and Renunciation werethe principal esoteric formulae. In this present Cycle Horus is doubly predominant, so we seeHim in his Dual Nature as Horus­Harpocrates.It is also interesting to note the character of Horus as Apophis the Avenger. The Isis, Osiris,Horus arrangement is quite the natural one for the course of events. Isis (The Moon) havingtaken the place of the Great Mother Nuit. But what of the Formula Iao, as Isis, Apophis,Osiris?If we make a list of several repetitions of the series thus:IsisOsirisHorusIsisOsirisHorusIsis. etc.and trace them back, we find the order Isis, Horus, Osiris, etc.; or Isis, Apophis, Osiris. Horusappears as the avenger Apophis to those who try to Go Back, or retrogress. He has to destroythem in order that they may be renewed. But as long as we go forward, we travel with theEver Coming Son, who is after all our Destiny, since He is within each of us as the TrueUrge of our Being. This, then, is the secret of the Way of the Tao; step boldly out on the Pathof Destiny, having aligned the personal with the Divine Will, and thus prepared ourselves forthe acceptance of that Destiny. Keep ahead of the urge from behind, and it will not fret us."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Then we become Free, Goers, Doing the Will of God upon Earth, Ever­Coming Sons ofGod.But if we attempt to lag behind to carry out some personal whims and wishes, Destinycatches up with us and forces us on. To those who willfully turn back and seek to avoidcooperating with the Divine Plan, Horus is the Great Avenger. Has he not said ''I am a Godof War and of Vengeance. I will deal hardly with them.'' Thus at his Coming in 1904 hefound the Race in a state of definite retrogression. ''Civilization'' met him as he advanced intriumph, and millions fell, without understanding what was happening. He still drives aheadin His Chariot, and millions more will feel his Force and Fire, until the Race recognizes that itmust right about face, and cheer the Conquering Hero on. Then we shall have Peace andRejoicing, and the Stern Warrior will seem as the Gentlest Child."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ALEISTER CROWLEYConcerning \"Blasphemy\" in GeneralThis essay by Crowley first appeared in The Bystander during his staging of the Rites of Eleusis at CaxtonHall, London in 1910 E.V. This republication is dedicated to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.­H.B.ÓOrdo Templi OrientisPIONEERS, O PIONEERS!WHENEVER it occurs to anyone to cut a new canal of any kind, he will be well advised tolook out for trouble. If it be the ishthmus of Suez, the simple­minded engineer is apt toimagine that it is only a question of shifting so much sand; but before he can as much asstrike the first pickaxe into the earth he finds that he is up against all kinds of interests,social, political, financial, and what­not. The same applies to the digging of canals in thehuman brain. When Simpson introduced chloroform, he thought it a matter for thephysician; and found himself attacked from the pulpit. All his arguments proved useless;and we should probably be without chloroform to­day if some genius had not befriendedhim by discovering that God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep before He removed therib of which Eve was made.THE ABUSE OF THE GUTTERNOWADAYS a movement has to be very well on the way to success before it is attackedby any responsible people. The first trouble comes from the gutter. Now the language ofthe gutter consists chiefly of meaningless abuse, and the principal catch­words, coming asthey do from the mouths of men who never open them without a profane oath or a foulallusion, are those of blasphemy and immorality. The charge of insanity is frequently addedwhen the new idea is just sufficiently easy to understand a little. There is another reason,too, for these three particular cries; these are the charges which, if proved, can get the personinto trouble, and at the same time which are in a sense true of everybody; for they all refer toa more or less arbitrary standard of normality. The old cry of \"heresy\" has naturally lostmuch of its force in a country nine­tenths of whose population are admittedly heretics; butimmorality and insanity are to­day almost equally meaningless terms. The Censor permitsmusical comedy and forbids Oedipus Rex; and Mr. Bernard Shaw brands the Censor asimmoral for doing so. Most people of the educated classes will probably agree with him. INSANITY AND BLASPHEMYAS FOR INSANITY, it is simply a question of finding a Greek or Latin name for anygiven act. If I open the window, it is on account of claustrophobia; when I shut it again, it isan attack of agoraphobia. All the professors tell me that every form of emotion has its rootin sex, and describe my fondness for pictures as if it were a peculiarly unnatural type ofvice. It is even impossible for an architect to build a church spire without being told that he"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"is reviving the worship of Priapus. Now, the only result of all this is that all this is that allthese terms of abuse have become entirely meaningless, save as defined by law. There isstill some meaning in the term \"Forger,\" as used in general speech; but only because it hasnot yet occurred to any wiseacre to prove that all his political and religious opponents areforgers. This seems to me a pity. There is, undoubtedly, a forged passage in Tacitus andanother in Petronius. Everyone who studies the classics is, therefore, a kind of accomplicein forgery. The charge of blasphemy is in all cases a particularly senseless one. It has beenhurled in turn at Socrates, Euripides, Christ, El­Mansur, the Baab, and the Rev. R. J.Campbell.THE MORALITY RED HERRINGLEGAL BLASPHEMY is, of course, an entirely different thing. In the recent notoriouscase where an agent of the Rationalist Press Association, Harry Boulter by name, wasprosecuted, the question proved to be not theological one at all. It was really this, \"were theneighbours being annoyed?\" \"was the man's language coarse?\" and the Judge and JosephMcCabe agreed that it was. But in modern times no one has ever been prosecuted in anycivilised country for stating philosophic propositions, whatever may be their theologicalimplications. We have no longer the Casuists of the Inquisition, who would take the troubleto argue from Bruno's propositions of the immanence of God that, if that were so, thedoctrine of the Incarnation was untenable (and therefore he shall be burned). It is only thevery narrowest religious sects that trouble to call Herbert Spencer and Atheist. What theman in the street means by Atheist is the militant Atheist, Bradlaugh or Foote; and it is asingular characteristic of the Odium Theologicum that, instead of arguing soberlyconcerning the proposition, which those worthies put forward, they always try to drag thered herring of morality across the track. Of all the stupid lies that men have ever invented,nothing is much sillier than the lie that one who does not believe in God must be equally adisbeliever in morality. As a matter of fact, in a country which pretends so hard to appeartheistic as England, it requires the most astounding moral courage, a positive galaxy ofvirtues, for a man to stand up and say that he does not believe in God; as Dr. Wacehistorically remarked, \"it ought to be unpleasant for a man to say that he does not believe inJesus\"; and my dislike to Atheism is principally founded on the fact that so many of itsexponent are always boring me about ethics. Some priceless idiot, who I hope, will finish inthe British Museum, remarked in a free­thinking paper the other day, that they need nottrouble to pull down the churches, \"because they will always be so useful for sane andserious discussion of important ethical problems.\" Personally, I would rather go back to thetimes when the preacher preached by the hour­glass.THE POT AND THE KETTLEI HAVE ALWAYS been very amused, too, in this connection of blasphemy by the perusalof Christian Missionary journals, on which I was largely brought up. They are full fromcover to cover of the most scandalous falsehoods about heathen gods, and the mostsenseless insults to them, insults penned by the grossly ignorant of our religious population. It is only in quite recent years that the English public have discovered that Buddha was not a"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"God, and it was not the missionaries that found this out, but scholars of secular attainment. In America, particularly, the most incredible falsehoods are constantly circulated by theMissionary Societies even about the customs of the Hindoos. To read them, one wouldsuppose that every crocodile in India was fed with babies as the first religious duty of everyIndian mother; but, of course, it is most terribly wicked for the Hindoo to make fun of thedeities of the American. For my part, who have lived half my life in \"Christian\" countriesand half my life in \"heathen\" countries, I cannot see much to choose between the differentreligions. Their arguments consist, in the end, of passionate assertion, which is no argumentat all.ORGIES!STILL, I SUPPOSE it is useless to contest the popular view that anyone whom any foolchooses to call an Atheist is liable to conduct \"orgies.\" Now, can anyone tell me whatorgies are? No? Then I must reach down the Lexicon. Orgia, only used in the plural andconnected with Ergon (work), means sacred rites, sacred worship practised by the initiatedat the sacred worship of Demeter at Eleusis, and also the rites of Bacchus. It also meansany rites, or worship, or sacrifice, of any mysteries without any reference to religion; andOrgazio means, therefore, to celebrate Orgies, or ceremonies, or to celebrate any sacredrites. It is really a poor comment upon the celebration of sacred rites that the word shouldhave come to mean something entirely different, as it does to­day. For the man in the streetOrgie means a wild revel usually accompanied by drunkenness. I think it is almost timethat someone took the word Orgie as a Battle Cry, and, having shown that the Eucharist isonly one kind of orgie to restore the true enthusiasm (which is not of an alcoholic or sexualnature) among the laity; for it is no secret that the falling away of all nations from religion,which only a few blind­worms are fatuous enough to deny, is due to the fact that the fire nolonger burns in the sacred lamp. Outside a few monasteries there is hardly any church ofany sect whose members really expect anything to happen to them from attending publicworship. It a new Saint Paul were to journey to Damascus, the doctor would be called inand his heavenly vision diagnosed as epilepsy. If a new Mahomed came from his cave andannounced himself a messenger of God, he would be thought a harmless lunatic. And thatis the first stage of a religious propaganda.THE STATIONS OF THE CROSSNOW THE REAL MESSENGER of God can always be distinguished in a very simpleway. He possesses a mysterious force which enables him to persist, heedless of the sneersand laughter of the populace. It then strikes the wiser people that he is dangerous; and theybegin on the blasphemy and immorality tack. In the life of our Lord, this will be noticed. Inthe first place, there was just the contemptuous \"he hath a devil,\" which was the equivalentof our \"he's just a crank,\" but when it was found that this crank had adherents, men of forceand eloquence like Peter, to say nothing of financial genius like Judas Iscariot, the cry wasquickly changed into wild accusations of blasphemy and allegations of immorality. \"He is afriend of publicans and sinners.\" A sane Government only laughs at these ebullitions; andit is then the task of the Pharisees to prove to the Government that it is to its interest to"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"suppress this dangerous upstart. They may succeed; and though the Government is neverfor a moment blind to the fact that it is doing an injustice, the new Saviour is crucified. It isthis final publicity of crucifixion (for advertisement is just as necessary in one age asanother) that secures the full triumph to him whom his enemies fondly suppose to be theirvictim. Such is human blindness, that the messenger himself, his enemies, and the civilpower, all of them do exactly the one thing which will defeat their ends. The messengerwould never succeed at all if it were not that he is The Messenger, and it really matters verylittle what steps he may take to get the message delivered. For all concerned are but pawnsin the great game played by infinite wisdom and infinite power. ORDERLY, DECOROUS CEREMONIESIT IS, therefore, a negligible matter, this abuse, from whatever source it comes. It shouldwaste my time if I were to prove that the rites of Eleuses, as now being performed at CaxtonHall, are orderly, decorous ceremonies. It is true that at times darkness prevails; so it does insome of Wagner's operas and in certain ceremonies of a mystical character which will occurto the minds of a large section of my male readers. There are, moreover, periods ofprofound silence, and I can quite understand that in such an age of talk as this, that seems avery suspicious circumstance!"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" HARVARD INDEPENDENT FILM GROUPJUNE 14thINTERCLUB SCREENINGKENNETH ANGERBy Robert A. Haller More that any other filmmaker of his generation, Kenneth Anger is recognized by the public as a maker of underground, experimental cinema. To main­line film critics he is the first­remembered such filmmaker, one who combines cinematic talent and an aura of scandal. This image has helped and hobbled Anger, thrusting him into The spotlight but also leading to an incomplete perception of his work as an artist. He is well known for some of his films (Fireworks, Scorpio Rising, and to a lesser degree, Kustom Kar Kommandos) and for his book Hollywood Babylon. But the total body of Anger's film­work goes beyond those three movies, and Hollywood Babylon earned its reputation in a pirated and very different edition from the one which Anger finally authored in the United States in 1975 (nine years after the pirate version appeared). He is much more complex than the image of violence and eroticism that these works suggest. A much larger portrait is what I want to attempt to compose in this monograph. A portrait rooted in his words and his films. Even so, it can only be abeginning, because as we shall see, Anger the artist is evolving,changing, growing, and the dimensions of his work have becomeclearer in time, both in relation to his own art and our ability tocomprehend it. Anger's initiation into the cinema came in two phases when he wasvery young. His grandmother was a wardrobe mistress in Hollywood,offering him opportunities to change his identity years before he began to attend school. During this same period he was selected to actin A Midsummer Night's Dream, playing the changeling prince. Yearslater he would recall that \"this rite of passage scampering in spanglesand plumes through Reinhardt's enchanted wood remains the shiningmoment of my childhood\" 1 Transfiguration and transformation are themes, working materials, that Anger has continued to explore in all of the years following his departurefrom Beverly Hills. In the interim he rejected Christianity, his family, he"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"from Beverly Hills. In the interim he rejected Christianity, his family, he began collecting stills and memorabilia from Hollywood and started making films himself (Ferdinand the Bull in 1937, just three years after his midsummer night's dreaming). While he was in high school, before he began making the films that start with Fireworks, Anger was introduced to the work of AleisterCrowley - an occult master from England, author of voluminouswritings which propound his philosophy of Magick. The relationshipof Crowley and Anger is obviously important: Anger refers to his workfrequently, has declared himself to be a disciple of Crowley and amagus, has included images of Crowley in central positions in many ofhis films (especially Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome and LuciferRising). But while Anger is a student of Crowley it would be misleadingto assume that his films are essentially illustrations of Crowley. Quitethe contrary: Anger's interests and studies are very diverse. He hasspent much of his life traveling, leading to his making such unlikelyprojects as Rabbit's Moon (dealing with the classic Commediadell'Arte characters Pierrot, Harlequin, and Columbine). The occasionfor Anger to make the film was a suicidal depression. That he wouldturn to such a \"traditional\" story at that moment of pain shows howbroad his horizons had become by his twentieth year. Crowley is oneof many important factors that should be considered in our responseto his work; others would have to include his love-hate of theHollywood film industry, his interest in ritual, his politics (the Marchon the Pentagon), etc. One of Crowley's central maxims was \"Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the law...\" For Anger, too, this is a primary premise. We can see evidence of this in his adoption of Puck in his film logo. Puck is described as \"the name of a fancied, mischievous or tricksy goblin orsprite, called also Robin Goodfellow and Hobgoblin.\" 2 Puck is also a figure in the Reinhardt-Dieterle A Midsummer Night's Dream, and arebellious trickster who can additionally be associated with Lucifer,another classic figure Anger has embraced (classic in the canon ofJohn Milton and Paradise Lost, not the Christian sense). All rebels, as was Crowley, they constitute a foundation upon which Anger has built a mythic superstructure, his cinema. Fireworks, Angers first extant film, was made when he was 17,shot in three days in his parents' home while they were attending the funeral of a relative. Unexpectedly powerful and disturbing, the film was described by Jean Cocteau as coming \"from that beautiful night from which emerge all the true works. It touches the quick of the soul and this is very rare.\" 3 When the film was shown in San Francisco for the first time, Maya Deren made a comparable |observation, suggesting that Anger had opened a window on our common dreams. 4 Anger's own remarks on the work range from \"A dissatisfied dreamer awakes, goes out in the night seeking 'a light' and is drawn through the needle's eye,\" 5 to this less crypticcomment: \"It's a personal statement about my own feelings about violence and(a) certain kind of masculinity. Also a treatment of a kind of myth inAmerica which relates to the American sailor. That's part ofhistory now, but the sailor then was a kind of sex symbol on oneanother level there was a great deal of ambivalence andhostility, latency, and fear in the image....\" 6 Fireworks is well known for its sudden violence and graphic images of"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Fireworks is well known for its sudden violence and graphic images ofmutilation, dreamlike In their intensity and fulfillment. Lessremembered are many of the small details that reinforce the narrativeof the film. The attention paid to the newspapers that blow along theground neutralizes any discomfort with the painted backdrop of thebar. Likewise, the humor of the film is often overlooked: when thebody of the dreamer is ripped open a quivering electric gauge is foundinside, an image that does not make us laugh, but relax -- we are nothere undergoing the kind of eye-opening attack Bunuel and Dalimounted in their Un Chien Andolou. In Anger's remark, cited above, he speaks of a \"dissatisfieddreamer\" who \"awakes.\" This dreamer, before he awakes, seesphotographs in his dream of himself cradled in the arms of a sailor.Then he rises from his bed, seeks his 'light,' and enacts the images hedreamed. We must assume either the dreamer sees the future, ormakes it his own, and in so doing, discovers a companion. This is, ofcourse, what Anger does in making films -- he realizes his dreams,makes his illusions real, to share with us. He finds a light as well--thebeam of a projector and the radiant energy that illuminates what isbefore his camera -- a kind of magic ray that allows him to perform hisown magic, to employ the powers of nature for his own purposes. In this monograph I am not going to attempt to discuss all ofAnger's works. Instead will skip forward to specific aspects of theworks that I believe have been missed and which contribute to a fullimage of Anger the artist. Three years after he made Fireworks, Anger was in Paris where thecinema as another instrument of magick was employed in Rabbit'sMoon (see frame enlargement). Here the magick lantern creates a\"picture\" of Pierrot's affection, but Columbine is stolen by Harlequin.and the hapless Pierrot is left alone under the pitiless gaze of themoon. Had Anger been able to complete the film, as planned. Pierrotwould have become lost in the woods, discovered a metro stationthere, and found within it an infinite series 31 images of the moon(\"Eclipse\" shoe polish posters) extending away into the darkness. (For more on Rabbit's Moon, see Appendix D.) Puns and wordplay are important to Anger. In the 1960's inInvocation of My Demon Brother, he would use the name of actor-composer Bobby Beausoleil in images as Beau-Soleil (\"beautiful sun\"). In Eaux d'artifice, the next film after Fireworks that he would complete as planned, Anger employed a similar use of words. As Alan Williams pointed out, \"Eaux d'artifice does not exist as a correct phrase in French; instead,!he title is constructed by one of language's oldest artifices, thepun. Eeux d'artifice means \"Fireworks\" (literally artificial fires), andso eaux d'artifice are logically waterworks or 'artificial' waters.\" 7 The point to this linguistic juggling is that Anger sees Fireworks andEaux d'artifice as a pair of films, a notion that emphasizes the dream-like and illusionistic qualities of the earlier film. Eaux d'artificedevelops around a costumed figure who moves through a garden offountains, a \"Hide and Seek in a night-time labyrinth.\" 8 Essentiallythe film is a musical development of this pursuit, culminating in theassumption of the seeker into the fountains, becoming one with thewater, suggesting that, like the protagonist of Fireworks, the seekerhas found the light, been transmuted by the experience."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"has found the light, been transmuted by the experience. To watch Eaux d'artifice is to become very aware of the artifice ofthe film (and, implicitly, of all films). Anger fashions a drama of flightand observation with his synchronization of the images to Vivaldi'smusic, and the visual manipulation of gargoyles seeming to leer at therunning figure (a dwarf, so as to increase the differential of scale).None of this diminishes our admiration for the work; one is struck bythe virtuosity of Anger as an editor. In the context of his other films it is also a departure for him. Anger has often pointed to the importance of Sergei Eisenstein's work, with its emphasis on montage as the collision of images. 9 In films like Scorpio Rising, Anger freely intercuts dissimilar images to work with what Eisenstein called intellectual montage. In Eau d'artifice Anger follows the opposite mode of film editing, the Pudovkin option of continuity instead of collisions. Rather than speak of Anger's subsequent films individually, I willdiscuss all of them in the context of the major work of his career.Lucifer Rising has occupied 11 of the last 27 years of the filmmaker's life (14 if we consider Invocation of My Demon Brother as a false start on Lucifer). With the completion of Eaux d'artifice Anger expanded his aim to larger, longer films, works that would be mythic rather thandreams, color rather than monochrome, involving casts whichnumbered ten or more, not five or less. Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome has its origins in a masqueorganized by Renata Druks, a friend of Anais Nin. Anger attended themasque, recognized that he could mould a similar gathering into \"aconvocation of magicians in the guise of figures from mythology,and assembled his performers at the home of Samson DeBrier. DeBrierand Nin have both written about the filming, 11 and P. Adams Sitney 12 has analyzed the film in extensive detail, so I will make onlytwo points. The central one is that the \"figures from mythology\" aredrawn from a pantheon that is distinctively Anger's: with the GreatBeast and the Scarlet Woman, Astarte and Pan, there was also Cesarethe Somnambulist, from the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari! A second point isthat with this film Anger's works begin to assume the form of religiousrituals. Pleasure Dome centers on a consumption of the Eucharist(even as its music is derived from Janacek's Mass). To screen this filmand subsequent works is presumably to join Anger in his role aspriest/magus/magician.Scorpio Rising, released in 1963, won Anger a public followingunprecedented for an independent filmmaker. Variety reported onMay 12, 1966: \"it opened recently in Greenwich Village House andstarted racking up more money than the proprietors had ever seen.Hence general release scheduled for July...Here it's mixed in withsurrealism-violence-motorcycles and 'seductive' male-torsos. Morepeople now find it funny when 'She Wore Blue Velvet' is played to ashot of a stud buttoning up his blue jeans.\" Again, Sitney discusses thefilm in depth, 13 and here I will postpone comment until later. Thoughpunctuated with references to The Wild Ones, Scorpio Rising becamea \"source\" itself, inspiring a whole series of Hollywood bike films, mostprominently Easy Rider and WR-Mysteries of the Organism byDusan Makavejev. Anger regards Scorpio Rising with a detachmentthat some would find surprising: 14 \"I have an ironic approach...That's the way I look at everything.That's my view of the world. I'm an artist. In that film Scorpio"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"That's my view of the world. I'm an artist.

I see lit) as a human statement. 15 In 1959 Anger had published, in France, the book HollywoodBabylon (J.J. Pauvert). Its publication in the United States in 1975,substantially revised, sheds much light on Anger's ambivalent attitudetowards Hollywood following .I quotation by Aleister CrowleyEvery Man and Every Woman is a Star\") and a dedication (\"to theScarlet Woman\"). Anger begins the discussion with a description of themammoth sets for D.W. Griffith Intolerance. By paragraph five thesets are deserted, \"stranded like some gargantuan dream besideSunset Boulevard. 16 Astonishing pictures follow, of rubble strewn sets,of the ruins of Belshazzar's court towering over bungalows, and thenof the human wreckage -- actors, directors, writers, producers, allunable to handle the pressure of sudden wealth and publicity, turningto drugs and drink and often death. For Anger the dissolution ofHollywood began with its birth in \"The Purple Dawn\" (the title of thefirst chapter). The title of Hollywood Babylon bears another Anger irony.Babylon, the capital of paganism, a center of worship for idols,presaged Hollywood's modern image. And architecturally.Hollywood was the sire for the reconstruction of Babylon, for D.W.Griffith's \"great leap into the unknown, his Sun Play of the Ages.\"17 This \"Sun Play of the Ages,\" Intolerance, was one of the mostdaring films ever made in Hollywood. Released in 1916, the movie wasa unique experiment in editing for mass audiences. Four narrativesdrawn from thousands of years of history were related simultaneously,intermingling at an increasing rate as the film approached its climax.Seymour Stern ranked it as one of t he two historic cornerstones of filmart, comparing it and Griffith's earlier Birth of a Nation to the Colossi ofMemnon in Thebes. 18 Intolerance and Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexicoare the two films which most closely resemble Anger's leap into theunknown, Lucifer Rising.Lucifer Rising from the beginning has been conceived by Anger asa kind of response to Scorpio Rising. His first efforts to film it began in1966; the following quotations make clear his feelings about thedialectic relationship between the two films (note that these areStatements of intention, comments on a work not yet filmed) The film Lucifer Rising is my answer to Scorpio Rising -- which wasa death mirror held up to American Culture. And for my own sakeI had to make an answer to it even though I still see plenty ofthanatic elements at work in America. it's a film about the Lovegeneration, but seen in depth -- like in the fourth dimension. And Icall it a love vision, and it s about love --the violence as well as thetenderness...l began shooting with the spring equinox. I'm typecasting in my film, and one thing I've found is that since my film isabout demons -- but love demons -- I have to work fairly fastbecause they tend to come and go...A demon is just a convenientway of labeling a force...\" 19 Like Scorpio Rising, Lucifer Rising is about several things. I'm anartist working in Light, and that's my whole interest, really. Lucifer isthe Light God, not the devil, that's a Christian Slander. the devil isalways other people's gods. Lucifer has appeared in other of my"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"films; I haven't labeled him as such but there s usually a figure or amoment in those films which is my \"Lucifer\" moment...l'm showingactual ceremonies in the film; what is performed in front of thecamera won't be a re-enactment and the purpose will be to makeLucifer rise. lt's the birthday party for the Aquarian Age...Everything I've been saying so far has been leading up to this happening in the world today. His message is that the Key of Joy is Disobedience 20Anger's statements about a film he was yet to make are ofparticular interest both in regard to the films he had made, and inregard to aspects of Lucifer Rising which have not been retained in theilm as we can now see it. Anger's emphasis on Light and Lucifer as the\"Light God\" cast light on the earlier works -- Fireworks, Eaux d'artifice,and Rabbit's Moon. In the first film, Anger's protagonist goes out intothe night \"Seeking a Light,\" which is argot for a homosexual pick-up.But for Anger it is a pursuit of Light as well: we soon see theprotagonist standing above a night-time highway, all black except forthe advancing headlights which approach as If in a swirling current.When the protagonist (Anger) does find Light, it means death/rebirth,and in the rebirth he is joined in bed by another whose face eruptswith scratched light. Eaux d'artifice is a film filled with fountains ofwater and light (it is the play of light on the water that is so beautiful),and at its climax Anger's protagonist becomes one with the shower ofwater -- and light. In the new, short version of Rabbit's Moon, Angerhas replaced the music track with a song that includes the words \"Givehim a light\" as Pierrot raptly watches the moon.Lucifer Rising incorporates a number of scenes in which theiconography of demons is visually transformed by editing whichunambiguously associates what we initially take to be ominous imageswith ceremonial headgear, the forces of nature, and other things thatwe do not associate with evil. Anger's Lucifer has followers who arepagan conjurers, but they are not Satanists in the malignant sense thatname usually confers.In 1973, Jonas Mekas interviewed Anger, who at that point hadmodified his conception of Lucifer Rising (much of which had at thispoint been shot, but not edited):\"Frankly, it's taken me into some very strange corners...You see, Ididn't think it was about demons or hell, really. l was trying to makea film about the Angel of Light. That was his first name. The Son ofMorning, you see. But now I almost believe what the Bible says.Though the Bible says very little about Lucifer. He's censored out,you see. Only a few lines. Satan, you know...So it's really about thefallen Angel, the fall from grace, and the hope of redemption, ofclimbing hack up the ladder. It's almost the story in a parable formof the Prodigal Son who goes away and falls from grace and then isaccepted back in the family again. Jonas: From the footage that I've seen...it looks like you're workingmuch through the forces of nature, with the images of elements ofnature. \"Yes, absolutely It's a metaphor. am trying to get awayfrom identifying with actor or actress as a person. I want to movethrough nature, and the people are elements of nature also.\" 21"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" Even now it is not clear why some aspects Anger refers to in thisinterview are not present in the film as of 1980. Perhaps, had Angerbeen able to complete the 93 minute version, instead of this 45 minuteersion, the Prodigal Son aspect would have been more visible.Nevertheless, it is present, though not emphatically. Likewise, theconception of Lucifer as Fallen Angel (the aspect present in JohnMilton's Paradise Lost and in Crowley's Hymn to Lucifer -- seeAppendix B -- the \"basis\" of the film according to Anger) is notemphasized; his Fall in the film is a consequence of the loss of theknowledge of his lore -- he is an invisible, all-but-forgotten force -the Lost God. 22One who did not forget, who celebrates the power of Light, ofMorning, of fires in the sky and in the Earth, is Kenneth Anger. HisLucifer Rising is a celebration, and an invocation of the power ofMagick to summon forth the forces of nature. Lucifer Rising beginswith images of the subterranean energy of the Earth, with Isis of Egyptattending to the process of birth under the morning sun, with chains ofimages that suggest the architecture of Egypt as metaphors for thatenergy. This opening sequence dissolves to the face of acontemporary magus, and the spectator must guess as to whether thesequence was dreamed or imagined, experienced or anticipated. Forthe form of Lucifer Rising is not linear but associative: Anger leapsacross centuries and millennia, condenses time and space in this film,composing not a story but a portrait of a force that has pervaded all ofhuman history. The magus in the second sequence of the film, the\"Adept\" or apprentice reappears throughout the film but his specificidentity is blurred, undercut, by the form of the film which placessuch great attention on transformation. At the close of the secondsequence he is impaled on a lance that he commands, sinks into a bath,and again Anger dissolves the image -- coming \"up\" with Lilith, who rises from a stone sarcophagus and eventually makes her way to a Celtic temple in Germany, where she ascends to watch anotherceremony. In all of this Anger wields specifically filmic devices withenormous skill. The darkened Adept dissolves to a light blue Lilith,who proceeds to a yellow Egypt, and thence to the German site whereAnger elevates her up the steps with a series of vertical wipes thatalternate day and night. To watch the film is to become intensely aware of the kinds and qualities of light, of its presence and absence, of its force (the sun here is somewhat parallel to the moon in Rabbit'sMoon).Lucifer Rising stands in stark contrast with Scorpio Rising in thatthe games and fooling around that punctuate the earlier film aretotally absent here. The aura of the film is much more celebratory, likethe sense of triumph one feels in watching inauguration of thePleasure Dome. In the final sequences of Lucifer, as Isis and Osiris jointogether to command forces still not understood, we join with them ina sense of dominion that is ecstatic. Anger's difficulties in making Lucifer Rising have been considerable. His first lead actor died, the second, Bobby Beausoleil, stole much of the footage Anger had shot in San Francisco in 1966 (this led to the making of Invocation of My Demon Brother). When filming finally resumed in the 1970's -- in Egypt, England, Germany, and theUnited Stares -- Anger encountered more difficulties, including theconfiscation of his film for several years. Economic problems haveforced him, even now, to issue the film in a version shorter than hedesired. In some respects, events have helped him as well;"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"desired. In some respects, events have helped him as well; Beausoleil, in prison for life, agreed to compose and play the film's soundtrack; this after three years work, he has executed with inspiration, making a striking film even more extraordinary. Anger was also able to obtain vivid performances from Marianne Faithfull, Myriad Gibril, Leslie Huggins and Sir Francis Rose (of whom Gertrude Stein wrote, \"a rose is a rose...\"). In the making for more than a decade, Lucifer Rising has inevitably been anticipated by many as an apocalyptic vision. After all, we are now approaching the end of the second millenium. What Anger has given us instead is a love vision, not The Final Battle. Anger has left us with a declaration that transformation and transcendence can be ours. The eddying smoke between the colossi at Memnon at the end of Lucifer Rising is such a declaration, his films thetransformation. © Film in the Cities, February, 1980 FOOTNOTES1.

Anger has the name of Lucifer tattooed ontohis chest.[96] Despite being a Thelemite, Anger has shown an interest in various other religious movements,particularly those that are in some way occult. For instance, he was a lifelong friend of Anton LaVey, bothbefore and after the founding of the Church of Satan in the 1960s, and lived with LaVey and his familyduring the 1980s. LaVey also made an appearance in one of Anger's films, Invocation of My Demon Brother(1969) as a devilish priest. Anger describes himself as a \"pagan\" and refuses to consider himself to be aSatanist.[89] He also claims Wicca to be a \"lunar\", feminine religion, contrasted with the \"solar\" masculinityof Thelema.[96]FilmographyDateTitleLengthNotes1937Ferdinand the BullLost film1941Who Has Been Rocking MyDreamboat7 mins.A silent black­and­white film in whichAnger filmed twelve other children inSanta Monica, California, interspersedwith images of war and destruction,which ends when a fog fills theirplayground and they all fall down,apparently dead.[97]1941–1942Tinsel Tree3 mins.A silent black­and­white film thatAnger personally hand tinted withgold­scarlet over the flames.
