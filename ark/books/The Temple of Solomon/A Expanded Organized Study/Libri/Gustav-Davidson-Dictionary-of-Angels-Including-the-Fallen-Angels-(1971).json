Such an idea did not occur to me-indeed, could not have occurred to me-until I had corralled a sufficient number of the heavenly denizens to make a dictionary of them feasible. At first I thought that angels, named angels, were to be found only in theBible. I soon learned that, on the contrary, the Bible was the last place to look for them. True, angels are mentioned frequently enough in both the Old and New Testaments, but they are not named, save in two or three instances. Virtually all the named angels in this compilation are culled from sources outside Scripture.' Of the books in the New Testament, while the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline Epistles have been longtime favorites of mine, the book of Revelation always held a particular fascination for me, mainly because, I believe, ofits apocalyptic imagery and involvenlent with angels. I read the book often. But one day, as I was leafing through its pages, my eye was arrested by verse 2, chapter 8 : And I saw the seven angels who stand before God; And to them were given seven trumpets. I laid the book aside and asked myself: who are these sevcn holy ollcs that stand before God? Has any biblical scholar identified them? Are they of the order of seraphim, cherubim, princi- palities, powers? And are they always the sallle seven who cnjoy the privilege and ellli~lence of closest proximity to the throne of Glory? And why seven? Were the seven planets the proto- type? Or did the notion derive froin the well-known chapter in Ezekiel 9: 2-1 1 which gives a terrifying picture of six \"men\" and a seventh \"clothed in linen\" whom God summoned to Jerusalem to \"slay without pity\"? Challenging, even intimidating, qhestions and ones that, I felt, ought not to be left unanswered. Meantime, the pursuit led me down many a heavenly brook. Over the years it served to unlock realms of gold I never suspected existed in Heaven or on earth. Of the seven Revelation angels I had no difficulty in establishing the identity of three: Michael and Gabriel (in Scripture) and Raphael (in The Book of Tobit). The last-named angel, by a happy chance, identifies himself: \"I am Raphael,\" he discloses to his young charge Toby, \"one of the seven angels who stand and enter before the glory of the Lord.\" No declaration could be more authoritative or conclusive. And so, with three of the seven angels identified, the problein was to bring to light the remaining four. 1. The Koran names seven angels: Gabriel, Michael, Iblis or Eblis, chiefji~l~l in Arabian mythology, counterpart of the Judaean-Christian Satan; Malcc or Malik, principal angel ofHcll; the two fallen angcls, Harut and Mariit; and Malaku '1-maut, angel of death, identified as Azrael. Contrary to popular belief and accreditation, thc Koran docs not name Israfel, lord of the resurrection trumpet."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"[x] INTRODUCTION I remembered reading somewhere of an angel called Uriel and that he was a \"regent of the sun.\" He seemed a likely candidate. I was confirmed in this feeling when I came upon Uriel in Paradise Lost (1 11,648 seq.) and found the archfiend himself providing warrant : \"him Satan thus accosts./Uriel, for thou of those seav'n spirits that stand/In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright,\" etc. Poe's Israfel, \"Whose heart-strings are a lute,\" was (or is) an Islamic angel,' and I wondered ifthat fact might rule him out. Then there was Longfellow's Sandalphon. In the poem by that name, Longfellow described Sandalphon as the \"Angel of Glory, Angel of Prayer.\" A great angel, certainly: but, again, was he of an eminence sufficiently exalted to entitle him to \"enter before the glory of the Lord\"? That was the question. Vondel's Lucifer, Heywood's The Hierarchy ofthe Blessid Angels, Milton's Paradise Lost, Dryden's State oflnnocence, Klopstock's The Messiah-all these works yielded a considerable quantity of the celestial spirits, some in the top echelons, like Abdiel, Ithuriel, Uzziel, Zephon; but I had no way of telling whether any of them qualified. Surely, I comforted myself, there must be some source where the answer could be found. Actually there were a number of such sources. I had only to reach out my hand for books in my own library. Instead, in my then state of pneumatic innocence, I looked far afield. Since I was unacquainted at the time with anyone versed in angel lore, I decided to enter into correspondence with scholars and theologians who might help me. I picked half a dozen names at random from the faculty lists of local universities, seminaries, and yeshivas. I put the question squarely to them. The responses were a long time coming and hardly satisfjling. 4 4 Not in my competence\" was the way one biblical exegete put it. Another referred me to the minister of a Swedenborgian church in West Germany. From others I heard nohg. But one rather noted maskil came through handsomely with two sets of seven, each leading off with the familiar mo (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael), thus: First List Second List Michael Gabriel Raphael Uriel Raguel Saraqael Remiel (or Camael) Michael Gabriel Raphael Anael (Haniel) Zadkiel Orifiel Uzziel (or Sidriel) I now had iiot oilly the seven ailgels I had beell looking for but a choice of seven; and, in 2. Not a Koranic angel, as Poe mistakenly makes him out to be. Israfel is not mentioned in the Koran, and Poe's quotation from it must derive, presumably, from a hadith (traditional sayin attributed to the Prophet) or from \"Preliminary Discourse,\" George Sale's long introductory essay to his trans k ation of the Koran. Scholars have pointed out that references to Israfel and tributes to him as the Angel of Music in Arabic lore were known to Poe as occurring in the works of the French poet, de Btranger (whom Poe quotes). and the Irish poet, Thomas Moore."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xi] addition, the ilailles of angels I had not heard of bef~re.~ In the course of further correspondence I was apprised of a branch of extracv~onical writings new to me: pseudepigrapha, particularly the three Elloch books, a veritable treasure-trove! Enoch I or the Book ofEnoch (also called the Ethiopic Elloch, froin the fact that the earliest version or recerisioil of the book was found in Abyssinia) was the most readily available. It literally rioted in angel names-many of them, as I quickly discovered, duplications or corruptions of other names. What were Enoch's sources? Did the patriarch (or whoever the author was to whom the Elloch books have been attributed) draw on his own lively imagination? (Certainly the 12-winged kalkydri and phoenixes were his invention.) Did he conjure his angels from the \"four hinges of the spirit world?\" Or did they come to him, as they have and still do to initiates, after a special, illystical concentration-a gift of grace, a charisma? I left that an open question, for the time being. The Enoch books led me on to related hierological sources and texts : apocalyptic, cabalistic, Talmudic, gnostic, patristic, Merkabah (Jewish mystic), and ultimately to the grimoires, those black magic manuals, repositories of curious, forbiddell, and by now well-nigh forgotten lore. In them, invocations, adjurations, and exorcisms were spelt out in full, often grossest detail, and addressed to spirits bearing the most outlandish names.The Church was not slow in pronouncing its curse on these rituals, although the authorship of one of the most diabolic of them was credited (without warrant, it is true) to a pope, Honorius the Third, who reigned during the years 1216-1227. The work is titled The Grimoire ofHonorius the Great, and made its first appear- ance in 1629, some 400 years after the death of its reputed author. Arthur Edward Waite, author of The Book ofCeremonia1 Magic, cites the grimoire as \"a malicious and somewhat clever imposture, which was undeniably calculated to deceive ignorant persons of its period who may have been magically inclined, more especially ignorant priests, since it pretends to convey the express sanction of the Apostolical Seat for the operations of infernal magic and necromancy.\" All these goetic tracts yielded a boundless profusion of angels (and demons), and I soon had more of the fluttering creatures than I knew what to do with. In order to keep my work within sizable limits, I started weeding out (Heaven forgive me!) what I considered to be the less important names, or the ones about which little or no data could be found. At this stage of the quest I was literally bedeviled by angels. They stalked and leaguered me, by night and day. I could not tell the evil from the good, demons from daevas, satans from sera- phim; nor (to quote from a poem composed at the time) \"if that world I could not hope to prove,/Flanhg with heavenly beasts, holy and grim,/Was any less real than that in which I moved.\" I moved, indeed, in a twilight zone of tall presences, through enchanted forests lit with the sinister splendor of fallen divinities; of aeons and archons, peris and paracletes, elohim and avatars. I felt somewhat like Dante, in the opening canto of The Divine Comedy, when, midway upon the journey of his life, he found himself astray in a dusky wood. Or like some knight of old, ready to try conclusions with any adversary, real or fancied. I reinember one occa- sion-it was winter and getting dark-returning hotne from a neighboring farm. I had cut 3. Subsequently, in other lists of the seven (Enoch I, Ecdra 11, etc.), I came upon the names of the following angels: Jophiel, Jererniel, Pravuil, Salathiel, Sarid, Zachariel, and Zaphiel."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"[xii] INTRODUCTION across an unfamiliar field. Suddenly a nightmarish shape loomed up in front of me, barring my progress. After a paralyzing nloment I managed to-Kght lily way past the phantom. The next morning I could not be sure (no more than Jacob was, when he wrestled with his dark antagonist at Peniel) whether I had encountered a ghost, an angel, a demon, or God. There were other such moments and other such encounters, when I passed from terror to trance, from intimations of realms unguessed at to the uneasy conviction that, beyond the reach of our senses, beyond the arch of all our experience sacred and profane, there was only-to use an expression of Paul's in I Timothy 4-\"fable and endless genealogy.\" Logic, I felt, was my only safe anchor 111 reality; but if, as Walter Nigg points out, \"angels are powers which transcend the logic of our existence,\" did it follow that one is constrained to abandon logic in order to entertain angel^?^ For the sake of angels I was ready to subscribe to Coleridge's \"willing suspension of disbelief.\" I was even ready to drlnk his \"milk of Paradise.\" But I was troubled. Never a respecter ofauthority, per se, particularly when it was backed by the \"salvific light of revelation,\" I nevertheless kept repeating to myself that I was pitting my per- sonal and necessarily circumscribed experience, logic, and belief (or nonbelief) against the experience, logic, and belief of some of the boldest and ~rofoundest minds of all times-minds that had reshaped the world's thinking and emancipated it (to a degree, at any rate) from the bondage ofsuperstition and error. Still, I was averse to associatiilg myselfwith opinions and creeds, no matter how hallowed by time or tradition, or by whomsoever held, that were plainly repugnant to colnnlon sense. A professed belief in angels would, inevitably, involve me in a belief in the supernatural, and that was the golden snare I did not wish to be caught in. Without committing inyself religiously I could conceive of the possibility of there being, in dimensions and worlds other than our own, powers and intelligeilces outside our present apprehension, and in this seilse angels are not to be ruled out as a part of reality-always remembering that we create what we believe. Indeed, I ail1 prepared to say that if enough of us believe in angels, then angels exist. In the course of much reading in patristic lore I came upon a saying by St. Augustine. It is taken froill his Eight Questions (\"de diversis questionibus octoginta tribus\"). I wrote down the saying on a piece of paper and carried it around with me for a long time, not as something I concurred in, but as a challenge. This is what Augustine said: \"Every visible thing in this world is put under the charge of an angel.\" Genesis Rabba, 10, puts it somewhat differently: \"There's not a stalk on earth that has not its [protecting or guardian] angel in heaven.\" Here and there, wherever it suited his thesis or purpose, St. Paul found angels wicked (as in Ephesians 6, etc.). In Colossians 2:17 he warns us not to be seduced by any religion of angels. Furthermore, God himself, it appears, \"put no trust in his servants . . . his angels he charged with folly\" (Job 4:18). There was the further injunctioii in Hebrews 13, \"Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.\" Sound advice ! And I was fain to say to Paul, as Agrippa the king said to him (in Acts 26: 38), \"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\" But whose 4. Walter Nigg's article \"Stay you Angels, Stay with Me.\" Harper's Bazaar. December 1%2. The phrase derives from Joha1111 Sebastian Bach's \"Cantata for Michaelmas Day.\""},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xiii] strange doctrines did Paul have in mind-Moses'? Isaiah's? Koheleth's? Peter's? St. James'? And if it is Paul who thus exhorts us in Hebrews (a book once reputedly his), one might ask: is Paul a trustworthy counselor and guide-a man who, as he himself admits, was \"all things to all men,\" and who honored and repudiated angels in almost the same breath? One thing I soon realized: in the realm of the unknowable and invisible, in matters where a questioiler is finally reduced to taking things on faith, one can be sure of nothing, prove nothing, and convince nobody. But more of this anoil. One of the problems I ran into, in the early days of my investigations, was how to hack my way through the maze of changes in nomenclature and orthography that angels passed through in the course of their being translated from one language into another, or copied out by scribes from one manuscript to another, or by virtue of the natural deterioration that occurs with any body of writing undergoing repeated transcriptions and metathesis. For example: Uriel, 6 6 presider over Tartarus\" and \"regent of the sun,\" shows up variously as Sariel, Nuriel, Uryan, Jehoel, Owreel, Oroiael, Phanuel, Eremiel, Ramiel, Jeremiel, Jacob-Isra'el. Derivations and/or variations of Haniel, chief of principalities and \"the tallest angel in Heaven,\" may be set down in mathematical equations, to wit: Haniel = Anael = Anfiel = Aniyel = Anafiel = Onoel = Ariel = Simiel. The celestial gabbai, keeper of the treasuries of Heaven, Vretil, turns out to be the same as, or can be equated with, or is an aphetic form of, Gabriel, Radueriel, Pravuil, Seferiel, Vrevoil. In Arabic lore, Gabriel is Jibril, Jabriel, Abrael, or Abru-el, etc. In ancient Persian lore he was Sorush and Revan-bakhsh and \"the crowned Bahman,\" mightiest of all angels. To the Ethio- pians he is Gadreel. Michael had a mystery name: Sabbathiel. He passed also for the Shekinah, the Prince of Light, the Logos, Metatron, the angel of the Lord, and as St. Peter (for Michael, also, like the prince of apostles, holds-or held-the keys of the kingdom of Heaven). In addition, as the earliest recorded slayer of the Dragon, Michael may be considered the prototype of the redoubt- able St. George. To the ancient Persians he was known as Beshter, sustaiher of mankind. Raphael, \"christened\" Labbiel when God first formed him, is interchangeable with Apha- rope, Raguel, Ramiel, Azrael, Raffarel, etc. And, to make matters more complicated, our healing angel operated under a pseudonym, Azariah (as in The Book of Tobit). The Zohar equates Raphael with a king of the underworld, Bael. The archangel Raziel, \"chief of the Supreme Mysteries,\" and \"author\" of the famous S+r Raziel (Book of the Angel Raziel), answers to Akraziel, Saraqael, Suriel, Galisur, N'Zuriel, and Uriel. The seraph Semyaza may be sunlnloned up by the pronouncelllent of any of a string of variations oil his name-Samiaza, Shenlhazai, Amezyarak, Azael, Azaziel, Uzza. Metatron, the \"lesser YHWH\" (i.e., the lesser God) and twin brother of Smdalphon, also had a mystery name, Bizbul. But Metatron had more than loo other names (see Appendix) and in magical rites he could be invoked by any of them. The leopard-bodied Camael (alias Shemuel, Simiel, Quemuel, Kemuel), while serving in Hell as a Count Palatine and ruler of the wicked planet Mars, served at the same time in Heaven as an archangel of the divine presence. It was Canlael (Kemuel) who accompanied God with a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"[xiv] INTRODUCTION troop of 12,000 spirits at the promulgation of the Holy Law. This is vouched for in legend.' According to another legend,6 Canlael was destroyed by Moses when he tried to hinder the Lawgiver from receiving the Torah at the hand of God. Satan paraded under, or hid behind, a bewildering array of forms and incarnations. The t t prince of the power of the air,\" as Paul picturesquely dubs him, is our best example of a quick- change artist in guises and appellatives. In ~oroa~trian theosophy he is Ahriman, enemy of man and God, a kind of ur-Satan (since Ahriman antedates by 1,000 years the Judaeo-Christian image of a prince regent of evil). In Leviticus, he is Azazel, the \"goat of the sin offering.\" In Isaiah he is Lucifer (or, rather, mistakenly identified as Lucifer). In Matthew, Mark, atid Luke he is Beelze- bub, \"lord of flies.\" In Revelation he is \"that dragon and old serpent, the Devil.\" He is Mastema andlor Beliar in The Book ofjubilees and The Book ofAdam and Eve.

But whatever hs guise, the once familiar peripatetic of Heaven is no longer to be found there, as guest or resident; nor is it likely that the black divinity of his feet will ever again be sighted on Fhe crystal battlements-unless he is forgiven and reinvested with his former rank and glory, an eventuality the Church forbids its followers to entertain as possible or desirable, since Satan and his angels have been cursed by the Savior Himself \"into everlasting fire\" (Matthew 25 :41). - Hell itself, one adduces from Enoch II, Testanrent oflevi, and other apocryphal and pseudepi- graphic works, is not located where one would ordinarily suppose it to be, i.e., in the under- world, but in the \"northern regions of the 3rd Heaven,\" while Evil in its various aspects is lodged in the hd as well as the 3rd and 5th Heavens.' The first 3 Heavens, according to the Baruch Apocalypse (Baruch III), are \"fd of evil-looking monsters.\" In the 2nd Heaven the fallen angels (the amorous ones, those that coupled with the daughters of men) are imprisoned and daily flogged.

Now, to fmd Hell in Heaven should not have surprised this writer, or anyone with a smattering of Greek mythology, for the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, \"residence of the shades of the Blessed,\" are in the immediate vicinity of Hades. A rabbinic commentary (Midrash Tannaim) vouches for the fact that Hell and Paradise are \"side by side.\" This is close to what one finds in a commentary on Psalm 90 (Midrash Tehillim) where it is stated that there were seven things which preceded the creation of the world, and that among the seven things were Paradise and Hell, and that \"Paradise was on the right side of God, Hcll on the left.\" In a commentary on Ecclesi- astes (Yalkut Koheleth) we learn that the two realnls are actually only \"a hand-breadth apart.\" This carefully calibrated survey is attributed to the Hebrew sage, Rab Chanina (Kahana), of the late 3rd century c.E.'

The noted scholar R. H. Charles, in his introductioil to Morfill's translation of Enoch II, observes in a footnote that \"the old idea of wickedness in Heaven was subsequently banished from Christian and Jewish thought.\" True, and none too soon. For what assurance otherwise would thc faithful have been given that, oil arrival in Heaven, they would not be lodged in one of the enclaves of Hell? Perhaps the best-or worst--example of the confusion to be found in noncanonical as well 10. The fact that in Paul's day there still were angels of evil in Heaven \"carrying sava e weapons\" would lead one to suppose that the fighting on high did not end with Satan's rout,and that Michael a his hosts won a Pyrrhic victory, or at best a truce. d 11. In this connection, the expression \"Abraham's bosom\" (Luke 16). interpreted as denoting \"the repose of the happy in death,\" may be cited here. The Apostles' Creed affi thatJesus descended to Hell after the Crucifixion. purportedly to liberate the \"saints in chins' (the unbaptized patriarchs, Abraham among them) in order to transport them to Paradise. The parable in Luke presupposes that Abraham is already there; and the fact that the rich ma0 in Hades (Dives) is able to converse with Abraham across the \"great chasm\" s ats that the chasm was not very wide, and that, hence, Heaven and Hell were very dose to each other, at least mxn speaking distance. Purgatory, it will be noted, is not mentioned. The explanation is simple: it did not exist-not, anyway, until 604 C.E. Gregory the Great invented it. Perhaps invention is too strong a term. Gregory very likely ap ropriated the notion of an \"upper Gehenna\" from the ancient Jews, or from the empyrosis of the Gmk stoics, or t!' om the twelve cycles of purgation of Zoroaster. Be that as it may, Purgatory was made official-it was \"legislated into existence\"-by decreer at the Council of Lyons in 1274, at Florence in 1439, and again in the 1540's at the Council of Trent, and is today pan of the religious belief of all or most Christians, except members of the Church of England which, in 1562, condemned Purgatory as \"a fond thing vainly invented and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.\" We know of no angels, fair or foul, inhabitin or frquentin the lace. According to Origen, d ?P it is reserved for souls waiting to be purged of the \"lighter materi s\" of their sins 'so that they may enter the kin C dom of Heaven undefiled.\" The duration of souls in Purgatory, an indefinable time, may be cut down by indu gences, prayers, and paid masses.

The Old Testament speaks of an adversary, ha-satan. It is a term that stood for an office; it did not denote the name of an angel. To the Jews of Biblical times the adversary was neither evil nor fallen (the Old Testament knows nothing of fallen angels), but a servant of God in good standing, a great angel, perhaps the greatest. However, he is no- where named. In Job he presents himself before the Lord in the company of other unnamed \"sons of God.\" There is no question of his being evil or apostate.'' The one instance where ha-satan is given as satan without the definite article (I Chronicles 21), is now generally conceded to be a scribal oversight. In a word, the Old Testament did not name its angels, except in Daniel, a late, postexilic book. There oilly two angels are named: Michael and Gabriel (names, by the way, that owe their origin to Babylonian-Chaldean sources). In the New Testament, on the contrary, Satan is unequivocably a person, so named. Here he is no longer the obedient ser- vant of God, the \"prime in splendour,\" but the castout opponent and enemy of God, the Prince of Evil, the Devil incarnate. The transformation of ha-satan in the Old Testament into Satan in the New, and the con- flicting notions that arose as a consequence, are pointed up by Bernard J. Bamberger in his Fallen Angels: \"The classic expositions of the Jewish faith have in~plicitly or explicitly rejected the belief in rebel angels and in a Devil who is God's enemy. . . . The Hebrew Bible itself, correctly interpreted, leaves no room for a belief hi a world of evil powers arrayed against the goodness of God. . . . Historical Christianity, on the other hand, has consistently affirmed the continuing conflict between God and Satan.\" This continuing conflict between God and Satan, one might add, is little more than a recrudescence, with modifications, of the dualistic system that Christi- anity (along with Jewish sectarians of the post-Biblical era) inherited from Zoroastrianism. Equally difficult to deal with was the question whether (and how many) other spirits in the celestial hierarchy were good or evil, fallen or still upright, dwellers of Heaven or Hell. This was a specially baffling problem and left me wandering about in a perpetual cloud of unknowing. A case in point: In Enoch I, 6, Remiel is styled \"one of the leaders of the rebel angels.\" Farther along in the same book, Chapter 18, Rerniel is metamorphosed into \"one of the seven holy ones whom God set over those who rise.\" In Revelation 9, Abaddon/Apollyon is the \"angel of the bottoniless pit,\" suggesting an evil spirit in the sense of a destroyer; but in Revelation 20, Abaddon/Apollyon is manifestly good and holy, for here he is said to have \"laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound hini a thousand years\" (in The Greater Key of Solomon Abaddon is \"a name for God that Moses invoked to bring down the blighting rain over ~~~pt\" !). Vondel, the Dutch Shakespeare (1587-1678), tells us in his Lucifer that Apollyon was known in Heaven, before he joined Satan, as the hierarch \"of the snowy wings.\" To Bunyan in Pilgrim's Progress Apollyon is an out-and-out devil, the devil, just as he is 12. The hasidic rabbi Yaakov Yitzhak of Pzysha, known as the holy Yehudi (d. 1814), makes this clear when he declared that \"the virtue of angels is that they cannot deteriorate.\" See Martin Buber, Tales ofthe Hasidirr~, Lclter Masters, p. 231. The fact that the adversary challenges God or questions Him does not, ipso kto, make the adversary 1, evil or an opponent of God-just as, when Abraham and Job \"put God to the uestion, they were not, on that account, regarded as evil men, or even as presumptuous men. See Harry M. Orlin 9 y's Ancient Imel, p. 30."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xvii] I in secular writings generally.13 Other examples, to cite a handful: Ariel, \"earth's great Lord\" and an aide to Raphael in the curing of disease, is at the same time a rebel angel hl charge of pun- ishments in the lower world. Kakabel, a high holy prince who exercises doillinion over the con- I stellations, is in Enoch one of the apostates. The angel Usiel, Gabriel's lieuteilaiit in the fighting on high, is designated a coillpanion of the lustful luminaries who coupled with mortal women; in Zoharic cabala he is the cortex (averse demon) of Gog Sheklah, \"disturber of all things.\" Anloilg the rabbis the opiilion is divided with regard to the 90,000 angels of destruction. Are they in the service of God or the Devil? Pirke Rabbi Eliezer inclines to the latter view. In the Pirke they are called \"angels of Satan.\" It is well to bear in mind that all angels, whatever thcir state of grace-indeed, no matter how christologically corrupt and defiant-are under God, even when, to all intents and purposes, they are performing under the direct orders of the Devil. Evil itself is an instrun~entality of the Creator, who uses evil for His own divine, if unsearchable, ends. At least, such may be gathered from Isaiah 45 :7; it is also Church doctrine, as is the doctrine that angels, like human beings, were created with free will, but that they surrendered their free will the-moment they were formed. At that moment, we are told, they were given (and had to make) the choice between turning toward or away from God, and that it was an irrevocable choice. Those ailgels that turned toward God gained the beatific vision, and so becaine fixed eternally in good; those that turned away from God became fixed eternally in evil. These latter are the demons, they are rlot the fallen angels (an entirely different breed of recusants which hatched out subsequently, on Satan's defection). Man, however, continues to enjoy free will. He can still choose between good and evil. This may or may not work out to his advantage; more often than not it has proved his undoing. The best that man can hope for, apparently, is that when he is weighed in the balance (by the \"angels of final reckoning\"), he is not found wanting.14 Angels perform a multiplicity of duties and tasks. Preeminently they serve God. They do this by the ceaseless chanting of glorias as they circle round the high holy Throne. They also carry out missions from God to man. But inany serve man directly as guardians, counselors, guides, judges, interpreters, cooks, comforters, dragomen, matchmakers, and gravediggers. They are responsive to invocations when such invocations are properly formulated and the conditions are propitious. In occult lore angels are conjured up not only to help an invocant strengthen his faith, heal his afflictions, find lost articles, increase his worldly goods, and procure offspring, but also to circuinvelit and destroy an enemy. There are instances where an angel or 13. In Jewish lore, abaddon is a place-sheol, the pit, or the grave; nowherc is it thc naille of an angel or demon. The term is personified for the first tiine in Revelation and a pears as Abaddon (cap A). St. John makes Abaddon s nonymous with Apollyon and declares it to be the Greek orm of the sallle angel. The Confraternity edition of K P t e New Testament adds here (Apocalypse 9: 11): \"in Latin he has the name Exterininans.\" On the other hand, The Magus, which offers a number of portraits of the archfiends in color, splits Abaddon and Apollyon into two separate and distinct \"vessels of iniquity,\" showing Abaddon with tawny hair and RoilIan nose, Apollyon with russet beard and hooked beak. 14. According to Abbot Anxar Vonier in The Teaching 4the Catholic Church (1964). angels still enjoy free will. This seems to be another or new interpretation of Catholic doctrine on the subject."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"[xviii] INTRODUCTION troop of angels turned the tide of battle, abated storms, conveyed saints to Heaven, brought down plagues, fed hermits, helped plowmen, converted heathens. An angel multiplied the seed of Hagar, protected Lot, caused the destruction of Sodom, hardened Pharaoh's heart, rescued Daniel from the lions' den, and Peter from prison. To come closer to our own times: it will be recalled that when Spinoza was \"execrated, cursed, and cast out\" from his community in Amsterdam for holding anlong other \"heretical views\" that \"angels were an hallucination,\" the edict of excommunication against him was drawn up by the rabbis \"with the judgment of the angels.\" The might of angels, as made known to us in Targunl and Talmud, is easily a match for the might of the pagan gods and heroes. Michael overthrew nloungins. Gabriel bore Abraham on his back to Babylon, whither an unnamed angel later conveyed the prophet Habbakuk (by the hair) from Judea, to feed Daniel pottage.\" Jewish legend tills us that, during the siege of the Holy City by Nebuchadnezzar, \"the prince of the world\" (Metatron? Michael? or perchance Satan?) lifted Jerusalem \"high in the air\" but that God thrust it down again.16 We know from Revelation that seven angels of the wrath of God smote a \"third part of the stars.\" The mighty Rabdos is able to stop the planets in their courses. The Talmudic angel Ben Nez prevents the earth froin being consumed by holding back the South Wind with his pinions. Morael has the power of inaking everythmg in the visible world invisible. The Atlantean Splenditenes sup- ports the globe on his back. Ataphiel (Barattiel), hierarch of Merkabah lore, keeps Heaven from tuillbliilg down by balancing it on three fingers. The Pillared Angel (mentioned in Revelation) supports the sky on the palin of his right hand. Chayyiel, the divine angel-beast, can-if he is so minded-swallow the whole world in a single gulp. When Hadraniel proclaims the will of God, CL his voice penetrates through zoo,ooo firn~amei~ts.\" It was Hadraniel who struck Moses \"dumb with awe\" when the Lawgiver caught sight of the dread luminary in the 2nd Heaven. As late as the 17th century, the German astronomer Kepler figured out (and somehow managed to fit into his celebrated law of celestial mechanics) that the planets are \"pushed around by angels.\" A briefword about the number of angels abroad in the world. Since the quantity, according to Church doctrine, was fixed at Creation, the aggregate must be fairly constant. An exact figure -301,655,722-was arrived at by 14th-century cabalists, who employed the device of \"calcula- ting words into numbers and numbers into words.\" This is a very modest figure if we regard stars as angels (just as the Apocalyptics did: John in Revelation, Clement of Alexandria in Stromata VI, etc.) and include them in the total.\" Thomas Heywood in his Hierarchy cautions us metrically: \"Of the Angels, th'exact number who/Shall undertake .to tell, he shall growl 15. See apocryphal additions to Daniel 5:86. 16. In 1291-1294 c.E., angels moved the house of the Virgin Mary from Nazareth to Dalmatia. thence to various parts of Italy, finally depositing it in the village of Loretto. The miraculous haulage is the subject of a canvas (now in the Morgan Library. New York), by the 15th-16thcentury artist Satume di Gatti. 17. Rabbi Jochanan (Talmud Hagiga 14a) reminds us that, far fro111 having ceased being formed at Creation, angels are born \"with every utterance that goes forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blcssed be He.\" The Jewish notion of a continuing act of Creation (as opposed to the rota sirrrul doctrine of the early Church) is traditional in Talmud, and embraces not only angels but all things formed in the first six days. This is clear from a hymn found in Greater Hechaloth 4: 2, where God is praised for not ceasing to create \"new stars and constellations and zodiacal signs that flow and issue from the light of His holy garment.\""},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xix] From Ignorance to Error; yet we may/Conjecture.\" Albertus Magnus conjectured, and put \"each choir at 6,666 legions, and each legion at 6,666 angels.\" But demons are winged horses of another color. Unlike the angels, these apes of God are capable of reproducing their kind. What is more, as Origen alerts us, \"they multiply like flies.\" So today there must be a truly staggering horde of them. The problem of populatioil explosion here is clearly something to worry about.\"' As for the vernacular employed by angels, the odds favor Hebrew. In The Book ofjubilees and in Targum Yerushalmi, we learn that the language God used at Creation and in the Garden of Eden was Hebrew. Even the serpent spoke Hebrew, according to Midrash Lekah Genesis 31 : 1. So, inferentially, angels also spoke it, or speak it. The Apocalypse of Paul puts it precisely: \"Hebrew, the speech of God and the angels.\" Indeed, in rabbinic lore, and in sundry secular writings, Hebrew is said to have been the language of all mankind up to the \"confusion of tongues,\" an event that occurred at the building of the Tower of Babel in 2247 B.C.E. (as conl- puted by Archbishop Ussher, noted 17th-century Irish the~logian).'~ That the Torah was originally conceived and set down in Hebrew is a widely postulated view among Jews, though disputed by Philo (who thought the language was Chaldean Aramaic) and by Muslims generally (who claim it was Arabic). St. Basil thought it was Syria~.~' On the whole it is safe to say that the linguafranca of angels--of all spirits, in fact-is Hebrew. Some exegetes hold that angels, being monolingual, speak the holy tongue exclusively, not even understanding the closely related Aramaic (as specifically stated in The Zohar I, 92); other authorities contend differently. They point out that Gabriel, Metatron, and Zagzagel each had a knowledge of seventy lang~ages.~' hl recent times, Sandalphon was overheard conversiilg in Yiddish, the eavesdropper being the storyteller Isaac Bashevis Singer. Furthermore, we have it on the word of the Swedish mystic Swedenborg that angels not only speak Hebrew, they also write it. In his Heaven and Its Wonders and Hell, he avers that \"a little paper was sent to me from Heaven on which a few words were written in Hebrew.\" Thls remarkable document, so far as is known, was never produced for public scrutiny, nor has it ever turned up among Sweden- borg's effects. Are angels inlmortal? In the opinion of most scholars, yes. But are angels eternal? No. God alone is eternal.22 Still, the life span of angels is a fairly long one, starting from the moment they were \"willed into being\" to the last crack of doom. But a number of angels have, mean- 18. Luther's followers, in a work entitled Theatrunc Diabolorum, not satisfied with the then-current estimates of devils, raised the figure to 2.5. billion, later to 10.000 billion. A reassuring thought, provided by Hagiga 16a, is that while \"demons beget and increase like men, like men they die.\" 19. At the Exodus and in the Wilderness, God also spoke Hamitic. He did this, it is said, in order to make Hiin- self understood by the Egyptian Moses and by Hamitic-qxaking Jews who made up the greater bulk of Moses' followers. 20. See The Book ofAdam andEve. p. 245. 21. Talmud Sotah, fol. 36, narrates that Gabriel taught Joseph seventy languages overnight. The ailgel Kirtabus (in Tyana's Nuctemeron) is described as a \"genius of languages.\" 22. John of Damascus qualifies this by saying in his Ewposition ofthe Orthodox Faith: \"God alone is eternal, or rather. He is above the Eternal; for He, the Creator oftimes, is not under the dominion ofTime, but above Time.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"[xx] INTRODUCTION while, been snuffed out.23 Thus God put an end to Rahab for refusing, as commanded, to divide the upper and lower watemZ4 God burned the angels of peace and truth, along with the hosts under them, as well as an entire legion of administering angels (Yalkut Shimoni), for objecting to the creation of man-a project the Creator had His heart particularly set on and was determined to carry through, although later He repented of the venture, as we learn from Genesis 6:6. God also annihilated a whole \"globe of angels,\" the Song-Uttering Choristers, for failing to chant the Trisagion at the appointed hour. And there is the case of a mortal doing away with an immortal: Moses, who in fact did away with two of them-Kemuel (already mentioned) and Hemah. This Hemah was the angel of fury \"forged at the beginning of the world out of chains of black and red fire.\" Legend has it that, after swallowing the Lawgiver up to the ankles, Hemah had to disgorge him at the timely intervention of the Lord. Moses then turned around and slew the vile fiend. While there are numerous instances of angels turning into demons, as exemplified in the fall ofone-thrd of the Heavenly hosts (Revelation 12), instances of mortals transformed into angels (named angels) are rare.25 Four instances have come to light, three deriving from passages in Genesis and I1 Kings. The first relates to the patriarch Enoch, who was apotheosized into the god-angel Metatron. The second relates to the patriarch Jacob, who became Uriel, then Isra'el, \"archangel of the power of the Lord\" and chief tribune among the sons of God.26 The third relates to the prophet Elijah, who drove to Heaven in a fiery chariot and, on arrival, was trans- formed into the angel Sandalphon.27 The fourth instance, vouched for in The Douce Apocalypse, is that of St. Francis, who evolved into the angel Rhan~iel.~~ Another instance is the transforming 23. The noted 12th-century Jewish poet and theologian, Judah ha-Levi (1085-1140) in his work called The Book of Kuzari (IV), taught that there were two classes or species of angels. He wrote: \"As for the angels, some are created for the time being, out of the subtle elements of matter (as air or fire). Some are eternal (i.e., existing from everlasting to everlasting), and perhaps they are the spiritual intelligences of which the philosophers speak.\" He goes on to say: \"It is doubtful whether the angels seen by Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were of the class of those created for the time be in^. or of the class of sviritual essences which are eternal.\" What were thev then? one might ask. \". Saadia B. Joseph was of the opinion that they were visions seen during prophetic ecstasy rather than outwaFd reali- ties.

This, however, has been disputed: \"the belief that the souls of the ri hteous after death become angels has never been part of Jewish thought\" (Universal Jewish Encyclopedia I, 314). Tiat it was at one time part af patristic thinking can be deduced from Theodotus (Excerpts) to the effect that \"those who are changed from men to angels are instructed for a thousand years by the angels, after they are brought to perfection\" and that then \"those who have been taught are translated to archangelic authority.\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xxi] of Anne, the virgin's mother, into the angel Anas (q.v.). Mention might also be made here of three Biblical psalmists-Asaph, Hcnlan, and Jeduthun-who showed up in Heaven, with their earthly names and occupations unchanged, as celestial choirmasters. Regarding the sex or gender of angels, I was often hard put to arrive at any conclusion in the matter, even with the help of scholars. True, angels are pure spirits and so should be presumed to be bodiless and, hence, sexless.29 But the authors of our sacred texts were not logicians or men of science; in the main, they were prophets, lawgivers, chroniclers, poets. They did not know how to represent invisible spirits other than by giving them visible, or tangible, embodi- ment: accordingly, they pictured angels in their own image (i.e., in the guise of men), acting and talking and going about their business-the Lord's business-the way men do.30 Angels in Scripture, as a consequence, were conceived of as male.31 However, it was not long before the female of the species began putting in an appearance. In early rabbinic as well as in occult lore, there are quite a number of them: the Shekinah, for one. She was the \"bride ofGod,\" the divine intvohnurg in man, who dwelt with lawfully wedded couples and blessed their conjugal union. There was Pistis Sophia (\"Faith/Wisdom\"), a high-ranking gnostic aeon, said to be the \"pro- - - creator of the superior angels.\" There was ~arbelo, consort of Cosn~ocrator, a great archon, \"perfect in glory and next in rank to the Father-of-All.\" There was Bat Qol, the \"heavenly voice\" or \"daughter of the voice\" ofJewish tradition, a prophetess symbolized as a dove, who gave warnings and counsel when the days of prophecy were over. Another female power that comes to mind is the gnostic Drop or Derdekea. According to the Berlin Codex, Drop used to descend to earth on critical occasions \"for the salvation of mankind.\" And there were the six left-side enlanations of God, created to counterbalance the ten male emanations that issued from God's right side.32 And finally there was the vixen Eisheth Zenunim, angel of prostitution and mate of Sammael. In Hebrew, eisheth zenunim meails \"woman of whoredom\" and the epithet applied with equal force to three other wives of Sammael: Lilith, Naamah, Agrat bat Mahlah. 29. In theology there are three classifications of spirit: (I) God, Who is divine spirit; (2) angels and demons, who are pure spirits; and (3) man, who is impure spirit. 30. In The Zohar (Vayera 101a) we read: \"When Abraham was still suffering from the effects of the circum- cision, the Holy One sent him 3 angels, in visible shape, to enquire of his well-being.\" And the text goes on to say: \"You may perhaps wonder how angels can ever be visible, since it is written, 'Who makes his angels spirits' (Psalms 104:4). Abraham, however, assuredly did see them, as they descended to earth in the form of men. And, indeed, whenever the celestial spirits descend to earth, they clothe themselves in corporeal elements and appear to men in human shape.\" But it is difficult to reconcile the foregoing with the statement in The Book oflubilees (15:27) that \"all the angels of the presence and all the angels of sanctification\" were already circumcised when they were created. On the issue of the materiality of angels, authorities have been divided. Those who believe that angels are composed of matter and form include Alexander of Hales, Bernard of Clairvaux, St. Bonaventura, Origen. Those who hold, to the contrary, that angels are incorporeal include Dionysius the Areopagite, John of Rochelle, Moses Maimonides. Maximus the Confessor, and William of Auvergne. 31. The Koran 53:27: \"Those who disbelieve in the Hereafter [are those who] name the angels with thenames of females.\" 32. In the texts of the early commentators, Moses of Burgos and Isaac Ben R. Jacob ha-Cohen, as in the supple- ment to The Zohar, there are also ten evil emanations (male), of which \"only seven were permitted to endure.\" See Appendix."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"[xxii] INTRODUCTION This free-loving quartet constituted a kind of composite Jewish equivalent of the Sidonivl Astarte. Zoroastrianism, which was not averse to including females in its pantheon, had its Anahita, a lovely luminary characterized as \"the immortal one, genius of fertilizing waters.\" Offsetting her was Mairya, evil harbinger of death, represented indiscriminately as male and female. She (or he) tempted Zoroaster with the kingdoms of the earth, just as, in Matthew 4, Satan tempted Jesus. Another angel of indeterminate scx was Apsu. In Babylonian-Chaldean mythology, Apsu was the \"female angel of the abyss\"; but, though female, she fathered the Babylonian gods and was at the same time the husband or wife of Tamat. She (or he) was slain finally by her (his) son Ea. A true tumtum !33 It seems, aho, according to Genesis Rabba and confirmed by Milton in Paradise Lost I, 423-424, that angels; at least some of them, were able to change their sex at will. The Zohar (Vayehi z3zb) phrases it this way: \"Angels, who are God's messengers, turn themselves into different shapes, being sometimes female and sometimes male.\" To revert to the question as to whether angels have an existence outside Holy Writ, or apart from the beliefs and testimony of visionaries, fabulists, hermeneuts, ecstatics, etct Such a question has been a debatable one from almost the start, even before the down-to-earth Sad- ducees repudiated them and the apocalyptic Pharisees acknowledged and espoused them. Aristotle and Plato believed in angels (Aristotle called them intelligences). Socrates, who believed in nothing that could not be verified by (or was repugnant to) logic and experience, nevertheless had his dainion, an attendant spirit, whose voice warned the marketplace philosopher whenever he was about to make a wrong decision.34 Now, to invent an angel, a hierarchy, or an order in a hierarchy, required some illlagination but not too much ingenuity. It was sufficient merely to (1) scramble together letters of the Hebrew alphabet; (2) juxtapose such letters in anagrammatic, acronymic, or cryptogrammatic form; (3) tack on to any place, property, fulction, attribute, or quality the theophorous \"el\" or \"irion.\" Thus Hod (meaning splendor, hke zohar) was transformed into the angel Hodiel. Gevurah (meaning strength) burgeoned into the angel Gevurael or Gevirion. Tiphereth (meaning beauty) provided the basis for the sefira Tipherethiel. The lords of the various hierarchic orders came into being in similar fashion, Cherubiel becoming the eponymous chief of the order of cherubim ; Seraphiel, the epollymous chief of the ordcr of seraphim; Hashmal, of the hashmallim, etc. Countless \"paper angels\" or \"suffix angels,\" many of them unpronounceable and irieducible to intelligent listing, were thus fabricated; they passed, virtually unchallenged, into the religious and secular literature of the day, to be accredited after a while as valid. In some cases they were given canonical or deutero- canonical status. The practice preempted no one from begetting ex nihilo and ad injnitunz his 33. Tumtum is a Talmudic term for any spirit whose sex could not be easily determined. See M. Jastrow, Dictionary ofthe Targumin. TalmudBabli and Yerusalmi, and the Midrashim Literature. 34. In the Middle Ages, the most eminent scholars and divines ranged themselves on opposite sides of the uestion. And that is perhaps still true today; a belief in angels is part of the doctrine of three of the four major Ziths-Chrktian (mainly Catholics), Jewish (mainly orthodox), Mohammedan."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTROD UCTZON [xxiii] own breed of angels, and putting them into orbit.35 The unremittq industry of early cabalists in creating angels spilled over into the raiding of pagan pantheons, and transforming Persian, Babylonian, Greek, and Roman divinities into Jewish hierarchs. Thus the kerubim of the ancient Assyrians-those huge, forbidding stone images placed before temples and palaces--emerge in Genesis 3 as animate cherubim, guardian angels armed with flaming swords east of Eden and, later, in upper Paradise, as charioteers of God (after Ezekiel encountered them at the River Chebar). The Akkadian lord of Hell, the li6n-headed Nergal, was cooverted into the great, holy Nasargiel, and in this acceptable guise served Moses as cicerone when the Lawgiver visited the underworld. Hermes, the good daimon, inventor of the lyre and master of song in Greek n~ythology, became in ~ewiih lore the angel Herrnesiel and identified with David, \"sweet singer of Israel.\" The rabbinic Ashrnedai derived from the zend Aeshmadeva. Etc., etc. The Church, let it be said to its credit, tried to call a halt to the traffic, although the Church - itself at one time recognized a considerable number of angels not in the calendar, and even per- mitted them to be venerated.16 Scripture, as we have seen, gives the names of no more than two or three angels. That there may well be seven named angels in Scripture is the subject of a paper by this compiler; it is a thesis on which, admittedly, no two theologians are likely to agree. In the \"orthodox\" count, fixed by the 6th-century pseudo-Dionysius (otherwise known as Dionysius the Areopagite)?' there are nine orders in the celestial hierarchy. But there are other \"authoritative\" lisaprovided by sundry Protestant writers that give seven, nine, twelve orders, including such rarely encountered ones as flames, warriors, entities, seats, hosts, lordships, etc. The Dionysian sequence of the orders, from seraphim to angels (a sequelice for which there is no Biblical warrant, and which Calvin summarily dismissed as \"the vain babblings of idle men\") has likewise been shuffled about, some sources ranking seraphm last (rather than 6rst), archangels second (rather than eighth), virtues seventh (rather than fourth or sixth), and so 011.'' Miracles, feats of magic, heavenly visitations, and overshadowings are often ascribed to 35. Isaac de Acco (13th-14th century), a disciple of Nahmanides, \"laid claim to the performance of miracles by a transposition of Hebrew letters according to a system he pretended to have learned from the angels.\" See A. E. Waite, The Holy Kabbalah, p. 53. 36. Certain early theologians like Eusebius (c. 263-c. 339) and ~heodoret (c. 393-c. 458) opposed the veneration of angels, and a Church council at Laodicea (343-381?) condemned Christians \"who gave themselves up to a masked idolatry in honor of the angels.\" This, despite the fact that St. Ambrose (339?-397) exhorted the faithful, in his De Viduis, 9, to \"pray to the angels, who are given to us as guardians.\" In the 8th century, at the 2nd Council of Nicaea (787), there was another change of heart, for the worship of angelic bein s was then formally approved. The practice, nevertheless, seems to have fallen into disuse. Today there is a tren d in some ecclesiastical circles to revive it. The Dominican priest Pie-Raymond RCgamey, author of What Is an Angel? (1960), thinks that veneration of angels is not a bad thing. but warns against the \"danger of such devotion becoming superficial.\" 37. The time that Dionysius lived and wrote has never been satisfactorily determined. Originally his writings were attributed to one of the 'udges of the Greek meopagus court), whom Paul converted (Acts 17:34). But scholars, r' finding such dating untenab e, moved the time ahead to tL e 6th century. However, according to a French legend cited by A. B. Jameson (Legends ofthe Madonna), \"Dionysius the Areopagite was present at the death of the Virgin Mary,\" which would place him back in the 1st century. The legend relates that \"Dionysius stood around the bier beside the twelve apostles, the two great angels ofdcath (Michael an&abriel), and a host oflamenting lesser angels.\" 38.

In ~attheh, the news of Mary being found with child of the Holy Ghost is conveyed to her spouse Joseph by the \"angel of the Lord\"; in Luke it is Gabriel who does the announcing- not to Joseph but direct to Mary who, however, seems to know nothing of the matter. The over- - night destruction of the army of Sennacherib, numbering 185,000 men, ascribed in I1 Kings to the \"angel of the Lord,\" has been laid to the prowess of Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, or Remiel. No one has yet, to the knowledge of this investigator, identified the specific \"angel of the Lord\" whom David saw \"standing between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched over Jerusalem\" (I Chronicles 2:16). A good guess would be Michael, for that battle-ax of God, when he is not in Heaven assisting Zehanpuryu or Dokiel in the weighing in of souls, is busy on earth lopping off the heads of the unfaithful.*O In their hurried exodus from Egypt, and in their encounter with Pharaoh's horsemen at the Red (Reed) Sea, the Hebrews were helped by \"the angel of God, which went before . . . and behind thein . . . in a pillar of fire and cloud\" (Exodus 14). Here the identity of the angel of God poses no problem: he was Michael or Metatron, each the tutelary prince-guardian of Israel. However, Michael or Metatron did not fight alone: he had the aid of a swarm of \"ministering angels who began hurling [at the pursuing or retreating Egyptians] arrows, great hailstones, fire, and brim~tone.\"~' Present also, it is reported, were hosts of \"angels and seraphim, singing songs of praise to the Lord,\" which must have helped considerably in turning the tide of battle. On the enemy side, harrying the Hebrews, was the guardian angel of Egypt, once holy but now corrupt. It appears though that Egypt had more than one guardian angel-four in fact, and that they all showed up, armed to the teeth. Various sources identify them as Uzza, Rahab, Mastema. and Duma. The fate of Rahab we know: he was drowned, along with the Egyptian horsemen. Mastema and Duma went back to Hell, where they had unfinished business to attend to. As for Uzza, some authorities say he was actually Semyaza, grandfather of Og, a leader of the fallen angels; and that since the Red Sea episode, and after his uilfortunatc affair with the maiden ~shtahar (immortalized in song by Byron), he hangs head down betwccn Heavcn and earth in the neighborhood of the constellation Orion. Indeed, Graves and Patai in their Hebrew Myths - say that Selnyaza is merely the Hebrew forill for the Greek Orion. 39. Miracles and magic were not always frowned upon by the Church, despite Jesus' exhortation against signs and wonders as a basis for belief(John 4:48). When Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) declared that \"no science yields greater proof of angels, purgatory, hellfire, and the divinity of Christ than magic and the Kabbalah,\" Pope Sixtus IV \"was delighted and had the Kabbalah translated into Latin for the use of students of divinity\" (Albert C. Sundberg. r.. in The Old Testanlent dthcEarly Church, Harvard Theological Studies, 1%4). However. a commis- sion appointe d by a succeeding pope, Innocent VIII, condemned at least ten of Pico's theses as \"rash, false, and hereti- cal.\" This seems to have been the attitude of the Church thereafter, the cabala being proscribed as a Jewish system of black magic, the \"laboratory of Satan.\" 40.

While God, naturally, rejoiced over the victory ofHis Chosen People, He did not like to see His angels crowing over it. Thus, the Talmudists describe God as silencing an angelic chorus that chanted hallelujahs when the Egyptian hosts met with disaster, by crying out: \"How dare you sing in rejoicing when my handiwork [i.e., the Egyptians] is perishing in the sea !\" [Rf: Ben Zion Bokser, The Wisdom ofthe Talmud, p. 117.1"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xxv] Jacob's antagonist at Peniel was God, as Jacob himself finally figured out whcn day broke (Genesis 32: 30). But our learned rabbis, after pondering the text, havcconcluded that the antago- nist was not God but an angel of God, and that he was either Uriel, Gabriel, Michael, Meta- tron, or even Sanlmael, prince of death.42 When Enoch was translated to Heaven, his angelic guide, according to Enoch's own testi- mony, was Uriel. But later on in the same book (Enoch I) Uriel turns out to be Raphael, then Raguel, then Michael, then Uriel all over again. Apparently they were the same angel, for Enoch throughout speaks of \"the angel that was with me.\" But perhaps it is too much to expect Elloch to be consistent. He is, as we have seen, notoriously unreliable. True, we do not have his original scripts, or even early copies; the writings accredited to him have come down to us in a hopelessly corrupt form, much of it clearly \"doctored\" to conform to the views of interested parties. Still it is hard to believe he was a clear thinker or accurate reporter, although he purports to have been an eyewitness in many of the incidents he describes. The habitat of angels proved equally perplexing. In the opinion of Aquinas, angels cannot occupy two places at the same time (theoretically it would not be impossible for them, being pure spirits, to do so). On the other hand, they call journey from one place to another, however far removed, in the twinkling of an eye. In angelology, one comes upon instance after instance where an angel is a resident of, or presider over, two or three Heavens simultaneously. Thus, in Hagiga 12b, Michael is the archistratege of the 4th Heaven. Here he \"offers up daily sacrifice.\" But Michael is also governor of the 7th and 10th Heavens. As for Metatron,.he is reputed to occupy \"the throne next to the throne of Glory,\" which would fix his seat in the 7th Heaven, the abode of God. But we find Metatron, like Michael, a tenant of the 10th Heaven, the primum mobile, which is likewise the abode of God-when, that is, God is not in residence in the 7th. Gabriel, lord of the 1st Heaven, has been glimpsed sitting enthroned \"on the left-hand side of God (Metatron's throne, then, must be on God's right).43 This would indicate that Gabriel's proper province is not the 1st but the 7th or 10th Heaven (it was in the 10th Heaven that Enoch beheld \"the vision of the face of the Lord\"). However, according to Milton in Paradise Lost IV, 549, Gabriel is chief of the angelic guard placed over Paradise, and Paradise being in the 3rd Heaven, we should, accordingly, fuld the enthroned Ailnunciator camping out there. Logically, one should look for Shamshiel, prince of in zebu1 or sagun (the 3rd Heaven) where Azrael, suffragan angel of death, lodges, next to the Tree of Life. But some 42. There are any number of princes or angels of death. Prominent among them, besides Sarnrnael, are Kafziel, Kezef, Satan, Suriel, Yehudiam, Michael, Gabriel, Metatron, Azrael. AbaddonlApollyon. They are all under orders from God. When they fail to accomplish their mission, as in the case of Moses who refused to ive up the ghost, then God Himself am as His own angel of death. According to legend (Ginzberg, The Legends &heJews III, 473). after God used His best arguments to persuade the aged Lawgiver that he would be better off dead than alive, and the Lawgiver still proving stubborn, God descended from Heaven (in the company of Michael, Gabriel, and Zagzagel) and \"took Moses' soul with a kiss\" (Jude 9). The legend goes on to say that God then buried Moses, but \"in a spot that remained unknown, even to Moses himself.\" 43. It is here also lion the right hand of God the Father Almighty\" that Jesus sits, according to the Apostles' Creed. 44. Other princes of Paradise include Johiel, ikphon, Zotiel, Michael, Gabriel."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"[xxvi] INTRODUCTION sources place Shamshiel in charge of the 4th Heaven (also called ~ebul).~' On the other hand, if we go by The Book oflubilees, Shamshiel is chief of the Watchers, and so properly he would be overseeing the 2nd or 5th Heaven, where the Watchers dwell, \"crouched in everlasting despair.\" Furthermore, in the guise of Shemuiel (the archonic warden who stands at the windows of Heaven \"listening for the songs of praise ascending from synagogues and houses ofstudy below\"), Shamshiel would be posted at the portal of the 1st Heaven. Which leaves Shamshiel where? Obviously, in an emergency, it would be difficult to locate him. A final instance : Zagzagel or Zagzagael, prince of the Torah, \"angel with the horns of glory,'' is the celestial guard of the 4th Heaven-let us bear in mind that Shamshiel is already in charge at this level-and Zagzagel, being at the same time seneschal of the 7th Heaven, his stewardship of the 4th Heaven poses a knotty problem. Confusion without end ! One is constrained to cry out, with the dying Goethe: \"More light !\" A contemporary of the great Hillel, Ben Hai Hai (identified with another noted rabbi of his day, Ben Bag Bag) used to say: \"According to the labor is the reward.\"46 Goethe in Faust, part 6, comforts his readers with a similar maxim: \"Kiihi das Miihen, herrlich der Lohn\"- \"Daring the labor, lordly the reward.\" If there is any reward for the labor of compiling this Dictionary, it is in the knowledge that every effort has been made to keep the sins of con~mission and omission down to a minimum (and no one knows better than the author how many sins may be committed in the course of such a work). There are still many problems left unresolved here. This is due either to the inaccessibility of much of the extant material in the field or to its indecipherability, or because the wit and wisdom to provide the solutions were wanting. Future investigators, better equipped, for whom some of the underbrush has been cleared away, may be able to provide the solutions, along with the names of additional angels that no doubt will turn up in new finds. I might interpose here (to paraphrase Rabbi Nathan's famous dictum, \"He who preserves a life preserves a world\") that the preserving of a single angel-not one of the \"suffix\" creatures-is like pre- serving a whole hierarchy. The task certainly is not an easy one, but it may prove easier than the one confronting this voyager when he started out on his quest, primed with only the scantiest notion of the labor that lay ahead. A good way to conclude this Apologia pro libro suo is to quote from a recently published paper on the guise of angels. It was there intimated that \"in view of the continuing hold of the supernatural over the minds of men, and the fact that a belief in the existence of angels (and demons) is an article of faith with two of our major world religions, and part of the tradition of at least four of them (Persian, Jewish, Christian, Muslim), it is highly probable that we shall have the winghd creatures with us for a long, long time to come.\" True, we may not always know whether we are in the presence of \"a spirit of health or goblin damned,\" whether we are being fanned by \"airs from Heaven or blasts from Hell,\" but it is best to be on guard. Even Satan, as Paul cautioned us, can show himself transformed into an angel of light. 45. In Peter de Abano, Heptumeron, zebu1 is also a designation for the 6th Heaven. 46.

Some read early versions of the text; others were generous with the loan of books; still others brought to my attention sources of information I might otherwise not have known. To all such, my gatitude and thanks. Appreciating the fact that a list of persons to whom one is indebted is hardly ever complete, I ask indulgence of those whose names are here omitted, not through any conscious act of mine, but by virtue of a faulty memory-a malady from which, I gather, many human beings suffer. From almost the beginning, two scholars encouraged and sustained me; also, on occasion, rescued me from exegetical pitfalls: Dr. Harry M. Orlinsky, professor of Bible at Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion, New York, and Dr. Abraham Berger, chief of the Jewish Division, New York Public Library. In acknowledging my indebtedness to these distinguished colleagues and friends, I absolve them at the same time of responsibility for any errors, oversights, theological sins, indefensible assumptions or conclusions of which I may be guilty, and which are apt to occur in a work of this kind and extent, despite every effort at rooting them out. The responsibility is solely mine. I cheerfully shoulder it. And I leave it to Hamlet's \"angels and ministers of grace\" to defend me. In the Oriental Division of the New York Public Library where I was (and still am) a frequent visitor, I benefited greatly from the friendly interest and wide-ranging knowledge of Francis Paar and Zia U. Missaghi (Ray Lord). They were unsparing of their time and help. In the Rare Book Room and in the quarters of the Berg Collection at the same institution I found the directors and the staff members equally knowledgeable, obliging, and helpful. Gershom Scholem of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, in response to my inquiries as to the identity of the right and left emanations of God (the sefiras), generously provided me with their names, along with the sources where I might come upon them (the 16th-century texts ofJacob and Isaac ha-Cohen of Soria). I am extremely grateful to Dr. Scholem. I am grateful to Dr. Solomon Zeitlin of Dropsie College, Philadelphia, for trying to \"authenticate\" the seven archangels \"that stand and enter before the glory of the Lord\" (The Book of Tobit). I am indebted to Prof. Theodor H. Gaster of Columbia University for his interesting observations on the angel Suriel; and to Prof. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton for making clear his views on Jeremiel and Uriel as being the same angel under different names. I am equally under obligation to Dr. Meir Havazelet of Yeshiva University, New York, who culled angels for me from the minor midrashim and who did not hesitate to ring me up in the middle of the night to spell out the names of winged creatures he had suddenly come across (in hechaloth or Merkabah lore) and which, he feared, I might have overlooked."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"[xxviii] ACKNO WLEDCMENTS I would be remiss if I did not speak here of the help accorded me by the late H.

From Zurich, where she made her home for many years until her recent death, she sent me rare books in practical cabala \"for our mutual benefit.\" Our friendship, though brief and late in coming, I count among my most cherished memories. perhaps this would be a good place to make general acknowledgment to editors, authors, pub- lishers, heads of libraries and museums, custodians or owners of works of art, for permitting the use of illustrations over which they hold the right of reproduction.

In Paradise Lost V, 805, 896, Abdiel is the \"flaming seraph\" who routs Ariel, Arioc, and Rarniel (rebel angels among Satan's hosts) on the first day of fighting in Heaven. Satan himself reels from Abdiel's \"mighty sword stroke.\" Milton hails the seraph as \"faithful only hee; among innumerable false, unmov'd,/Unshak'n, unseduc'd\" (896-897). West in Milton and the Angels, p. 124, states that Abdiel as an angel was invented by Milton; however, on p. 154, Professor West correctly points out that Abdiel is to be found in The Book ofthe Angel Raziel (op. lit.). In the Bible (I Chron- icles), Abdiel is not the name of an angel but of a mortal, a Gedite, a resident of Gilead. This is doubtlessly the original source for the name.

According to the older mythographers, Abraxas is, or was, a demon, and placed with the Egyptian gods. The word \"abracadabra\" is reputedly derived from Abraxas. Originally it was a word expressing, in the gnostic system, the aeons or cycles of creation; in a deeper sense, it served as a term for God.

They had a vogue in Jewish gnostic, mystic, and cabalistic tracts. Angelology came into full flower in the 11th- 13th centuries when the names of literally thous- ands upon thousands of angels appeared, many of them created through the juggling of letters of the Hebrew alphabet, or by the simple device of adding the suffix \"el\" to any word which lent itself to such manipulation. An angel, though immaterial, that is, bodiless, is usually depicted as having a body or inhabiting a body, pro tem, and as winged and clothed. If an angel is in the service ofthe devil, he is a fallen angel or a demon. To Philo, in his \"On Dreams,\" angels were in- corporeal intelligences. He held that the rabbis, on the contrary, thought of angels as material beings. In Roman Catholic theology, angels were created in the earliest days of Creation, or even before Creation, tota simul, that is, at one and the same time. In Jewish tradition, angels are \"new every morning\" (Lamentations 3 : 23) and continue to be formed with every breath God takes (Hagiga 14a). In the pseudo-Dionysian scheme with its 9 heavenly choirs, angels as an order rank low- est in the scale of hierarchy, the seraphim rank- ing highest. The archangels show up 8th in the sequence, despite the fact that the greatest angels are often referred to as archangels. Strictly speak- ing, when one refers to the named angels in the Bible, it is correct to say there are only 2 or 3. But the following may be considered: Abaddonl Apollyon, mentioned in Revelation as the \"angel of the bottomless pit.\" Wormwood, referred to as a star (Revelation 8: ll), but to be understood as an angel. And there is Satan, who in the Old Testa- ment is a great angel, one of the most glorious, certainly not evil and with no hint of his having fallen. He goes by his title of adversary (ha-satan). It is only in Christian and post-Biblical Jewish writings that ha-satan of the Old Testament is turned into an evil spirit. A case for including Rahab among the named angels of the Bible might also be made: Talmud refers to Rahab as \"the angel of the sea.\" \"Angel in the Forest9'-the title of Marguer- ite Young's chronicle of the Rappites, a German religious sect that established a short-lived com- munity on the Wabash River during the years 1815-1824.

The angel of truth was also burned, and for the same reason. Later, it seems, they were both revived.

Wherever the expression occurs in the Old Testament, it is a periphrasis. The earliest versions of the Old Testament had, in the opinion of later scribes, too many direct interventions of God in human affairs; the use of \"angel of Yah- weh\" or \"angel of the Lord\" was by way of reducing His earthly appearances and the carrying out of His commands through the agency of angelic intermediaries.

The term also applied to the abode of evil spirits (Hell). In Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress Apollion is the devil. Bunyan thus de- scribes him: \"clothed with scales like a fish and wings like a dragon, feet like a bear, and out of his belly came fire and smoke.\" He is so pictured by a 17th-century artist, the sketch reproduced in an early edition of Pilgrim's Progress.

Mathers, The Greater Key of Solomon.] Archangel of the Covenant-a term applied to Michael in the Coptic Apocalypse ofPaul. Archangel Ruin'd-Satan is so called by Milton in Paradise Lost I, 593. Archangels-the term archangel applies gen- etically to all angels above the grade of (the order of) angels; it also serves to designate a specific rank of angels in the celestial hierarchy. In the pseudo-Dionysian scheme of 9 orders or choirs, the order of archangel is placed 8th-that is, next to the last in rank, immediately above the order of angels. This is a bit confusing, since the greatest angels are referred to as archangels, as in the Old Testament, where Daniel calls Michael \"one of the chief princes,\" which is taken to mean one of the archangels. In the New Testament the term archangels occurs only twice: in I Thessalonians and in Jude. In the latter only, however, is Michael specifically designated an archangel. In Revelation 8:2, John refers to the \"seven angels who stand before God,\" and this is commonly interpreted to mean the 7 archangels. The Book ofEnoch (Enoch I) names the 7: Uriel, Raguel, Michael, Seraqael, Gabriel, Haniel, Raphael. Later Judaism gives Phanuel as an alternate for Uriel. Other lists in apocrypha and pseudepigrapha give, as variants, such angels as Barachiel, Jehudiel, Sealtiel, Ori- phiel, Zadkiel, and Anael (Haniel). The archangels, according to the Testament of Levi, \"minister and make propitiation to the Lord for the sins of ignorance and of the righteous.\" The ruling prince of the order is usually given as Raphael or Michael. The Koran recognizes 4 archangels but names only 2: Gabriel (Jibril), who is the angel of revelation, and Michael, the warrior angel who fights the battle of the faithful. The 2 unnamed angels are Azrael, angel of death; and Israfel, angel of music, who will sound the trumpet (one of 3 or 4 trumpets) on the Day of Judgment. The earliest source for the names of the archangels is traced to Al-Barceloni, a writer of mystic works in the post-Talmudic period, who related them to the planets. In other writings \"we meet with the conception of 12 archangels connected with the signs of the zodiac.\" [Rf: The Book ofthe Angel Raxiel 52a, 61a; Ginzberg, The Legerrds of theJews V, 24.1 For the names of the 12 and their zodiacal signs, see Appendix.

In the Ophitic (gnostic) system, 7 archons are designated: Jaldabaoth, Jao, Sabaoth, Adonaios, Astanphaios, Ailoaios, Oraios.

Cornelius Agrippa 44 says: Ariel is the name of an angel, sometimes also of a demon, and of a city, whence called Ariopolis, where the idol is worshipped.\" In Heywood, The Hierarchy of the Blesstd Angels, Ariel ranks as one of 7 princes who rule the waters and is \"Earth's great Lord.\" Jewish mystics used Ariel as a poetic name for Jerusalem. In the Bible the name denotes, variously, a man, a city (Isaiah 29), and an altar. In occult writings Ariel is the \"3rd archon of the winds.\" Mention is also made of Ariel as an angel who assists Raphael in the cure of disease. [Rf: M. Gaster, Wisdom of the Chaldeans.] In the Coptic Pistis Sophia, Ariel is in charge of punishment in the lower world, corres- ponding with Ur of the Mandaeans (9.v.). In The Testament of Solomort, he controls demons. In gnostic lore generally he is a ruler of winds and equated with Ialdabaoth as an older name for this god. In practical cabala he is regarded as originally of the order of virtues. According to John Dee, astrologer royal in Queen Elizabeth's day, Ariel is a conglomerate of Anael and Uriel. In The Temp- est, Shakespeare casts Ariel as a sprite. To Milton he is a rebel angel, overcoine by the seraph Abdiel in the first day of fighting in Heaven.

Azazel \"taught men to fashion swords and shields\" while women learned from him ''finery and the art of beautifyrng the eyelids.\" He is the scapegoat in rabbinic literature, Targum, and in Leviticus 16:8, although in the latter he is not actually named. In The Zohar (Vayeze 153a) the rider on the serpent is symbolized by \"the evil Azazel.\" Here he is said to be chief of the order of bene elim (otherwise ischirn, lower angels, \"men-spirits\").

Jewish legend speaks of Azazel as the angel who refused to bow down before Adam (in the Koran thk angel is Eblis or Iblis) whei the 1st human was presented to God to the assembled hierarchs in Heaven.

In their tradition, he has \"70,000 feet and 4,000 wings, while his body is provided with as many eyes and tongues as there are men in the world.\" [Rf: Hastings, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics IV, 617.1 In Arabic tradition, Azrael is \"forever writing in a large book and forever erasing what he writes; what he writes is the birth of a man, what he erases is the name of the man at death.\" When Michael, Gabriel, and Israfel failed to provide 7 handfuls of earth for the creation of Adam, the 4th angel on this mission, Azrael, succeeded; and because of this feat he was appointed to separate body fiom soul.

Azza (Shemyaza, meaning \"the name Azza\") is said to be constantly falling, with one eye shut, the other open, so that he can see his plight and suffer the more. There is another explanation for Azza's expulsion from Heaven: it is that he objected to the high rank given Enoch when the latter was transformed from a mortal into the angel Metatron (see Iblis or Eblis). In Solomonic lore the story is that Azza was the angel who revealed to the Jewish king the heavenly arcana, thus making Solomon the wisest man on earth. In Talmud, the sedim (Assyrian guardian spirits) are said to have been \"begotten by Azza and Azael on the body of the evil Naamah, daughter of Lamech, before the Flood.\" [Rf. Thompson, Semitic Magic, pp. 44-45.] In his introduction to 3 Enoch, Odeberg remarks that, of the 2 groups of angels headed by Metatron, one group (the angels of justice) was under the ruler- ship of Azza. At that time, evidently, Azza was not yet fdlen. Azzael (see Azza)-while Azza and Azzael, in some sources, are referred to as 2 distinct, separate angels, they seem to be one and the same in other sources. Variant spellings are Assiel, Azazel, Azzazel, etc. In the early part of 3 Enoch, Azzael is represented as one of 3 ministering angels (Uzza and Azza being the other 2), inhabitants of the 7th Heaven; later, however, he is represented as a fallen angel and ranked with Azza as one of the maskim (9.v.). For cohabiting with the daughters of men, he was punished (with Uzza) by having his nose pierced. He taught witchcraft, by the art of which man can cause (or did cause at one time) the sun, moon and stars to descend from the sky, so as to make them closer objects of worship. [Rf.

In the cabala, he is chief of the 9 evil hierarchies of the underworld.

In Paradise Lost I, 490-492, \"Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd/Fell not from Heav'n, or more gross to love/Vice it self.\" Later, in Paradise Lost 11, 110-112, Milton speaks of Belial thus: \"A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemed/For dignity compos'd and high ex- ploit;\" but hastens to add: \"all was false and hol- low.\" \"Possibly an old name for Sheol,\" says Barton in \"Origin of the Names of Angels and Demons.\" In The Toilers ofthe Sea, Victor Hugo, drawing on occult sources, speaks of Belial as Hell's ambassador to Turkey.

Beliar is mentioned in Deu- teronomy, Judges, and I Samuel, always as evil, its symbol or personification. In apocryphal writings Beliar is the prince of darkness, supreme adversary of God. In The Martyrdom ofIsaiah he is the angel of lawlessness. In The Gospel of Bartholomew, Bartholomew asks Beliar to tell who he is, and Beliar answers: \"At first I was called Satanel, which is interpreted a messenger of God, but when I rejected the image of God my name was calld Satanas, that is, an angel that keepeth Hell (Tartarus). . . .

These are the angels of vengeance that were first formed.\" [RJ James, The Apocryphal New Testament, p. 175.1 In Waite, The Lemegeton, Beliar is said to have been created \"next after Lucifer.\" As a fallen angel Beliar boasts that he \"fell first among the worthier sort.\" Milton calls him a \"false-titled son of God.\" According to the Schoolmen, Beliar was once partly of the order of angels and partly of the order of virtues. However, Glasson, Greek Influence in Jewish Eschatology, argues that Beliar was never an angel and compares him with Ahriman, chief devil in Persian mythology, who was \"independent of God and God's opposite equal.\" [See Ahriman.] The tradition that Beliar is Hell's primate is carried on in the work of two modern writers, Thomas Mann and Aldous Huxley, both of whom regard Beliar as the exem- plar and epitome of evil. Belphegor or Behgor or Baal-Peor (\"lord of openingw or \"lord Baal of Mt. PhegorW)-a Moabite god of licentiousness who was once, according to cabalists, an angel of the order of principalities. In Hell, Belphegor is the demon of discoveries and ingenious inventions. When invoked, he appears in the form of a young woman. Rufinus and Jerome identify Belphegor with Priapus (see Numbers 25: 1-3). De Plancy Dictioirtraire Infernal indicates that certain digni- taries of the infernal empire served as special envoys or ambassadors to the nations of the earth, and that Belphegor was accredited to France. Victor Hugo in The Toilers of the Sea confirms De Plancy's accreditation of Belphegor to Paris. [RJ Jonson, The Devil Is air Ass; Wilson, Belphegor or the Marriage of the Devil (1691).] According to Milton, Belphegor is a variant for Nisroc (Paradise Lost VI, 447), whom he lists as \"of Principalities the prime.\" Masters, Eros and Evil, suggests that Belphegor is the counterpart of the Hindu Rutrem, who is usually represented with an erect phallus.

[Rf: Waite, The Lemegeton.] Celestial Hierarchy-based on interpretations of Scriptural passages and as enumerated by St. Ambrose, pseudo-Dionysius, Pope Gregory, and others, the orders or choirs of the celestial hier- archy range from 7 to 10 or 11 in number; they were fdly fixed at 9 in triple triads thus: seraphim, cherubim, thrones; dominations (or dominions), powers, virtues; principalities (or princedoms), archangels, angels. The 2nd triad is sometimes given as dominions, virtues, powers. Variants include orders called hosts, aeons, inno- cents, confessors, lordships, authorities, warriors, etc. In Mathers, The Greater Key of Solomon, con- jurations are prescribed for \"ten choirs of the Holy Angels,\" to wit : (1) chaioth ha-Qadesh; (2) auphanim; (3) aralim; (4) chashmalim; (5) sera- phim; (6) malachim; (7) elohim; (8) beni elohim; , (9) kerubim; (10) ishim; these are the 10 mentioned by Maimonides in his Mishna Thora. The Berith Menucha offers a slightly different list of 10: arellim, ishim, bene elohim, mal'achim, chash- mallim, tarshishim, shina'nim, kerubim, ophan- nim, seraphim. [Rf: Charles, The Book of the Secrets of Enoch (Enoch II), Chap. 20, h.] After Aquinas \"blessed\" the Dionysian scheme of 9 choirs in their triple triads, the Church adhered to it. Early Protestants, however, not only dis- puted it but also rejected it. Some occult works such as Barrett, The Magus, added a 4th triad, making 12 orders. It will be recalled that Dante in his Paradise, canto 28, calls Pope Gregory to account for \"dissenting\" from the Dionysian setup. [q.

The word, in AkkacLan, is karibu and means \"one who prays\" or \"one who intercedes,\" although Dionysius declared the word to mean knowledge. In ancient Assyrian art, the cherubim were pictured as huge, winged creatures with leonine or human faces, bodies of bulls or sphinxes, eagles, etc. They were usually placed at entrances to palaces or temples as guardian spirits. In early Canaanitish lore, the cherubim were not conceived of as angels. [Cf: view of Theodorus, Bishop of Heracleba, who declared \"these cherubims not to be any Angelicall powers, but rather some horrible visions of Beasts, which might terrifie Adam from Cherubs.

To Philo (\"On the Cherubim\") they symbolized God's highest and chiefest potencies, sovereignty, and goodness. They are the 1st angels to be mentioned (and to be construed as angels) in the Old Testament (Genesis 3: 22). They guarded with flaming sword the Tree of Life and Eden, hence their designation as the \"flame of whirling swords.\" In Exodus 25:18 we find 2 cherubim \"of gold,\" one on either side of the Ark (see picturization in SchafT, A Dictionary of the Bible). [C.' \"cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat\" in Hebrews 9:5.] In Ezekiel (10: 14) 4 cheru- bim, each with 4 faces and 4 wings, appear at the river Chebar where the Hebrew prophet glimpses them. In I Kings 6:23, the 2 cherubim in Solo- mon's temple are carved out of olive wood. In rabbinic and occult lore, the cherubim are pre- vailingly thought of as charioteers of God, bearers of His throne, and personifications of the winds. In Revelation (4:8) they are living creatures who render unceasing praise to their Maker. Here St. John refers to them as beasts (holy, divine beasts), &winged and \"full of eyes within.\" John of Dam- ascus in his Exposition of the Orthodox Faith also speaks of the cherubim as \"many-eyed.\" In Talmud the cherubim are equated with the order ophanim (wheels or chariots) or the order hay- yoth (holy beasts) and are said to reside in the 6th or 7th Heaven. In the Dionysian scheme, the cheru- bim rank 2nd in the Pchoir hierarchy and are guardians of the fixed stars. Chief rulers, as listed in most occult works, include Ophaniel, Rikbiel, Cherubiel, Raphael, Gabriel, Zophiel, and-before his fall-Satan, who was, as Parente says in The 11 Angels, the supreme angel in the choir of cheru- bim.\" In the early traditions of Muslim lore it is claimed that the cherubim were formed from the tears Michael shed over the sins of the faithful. [RJ Hastings, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics IV, 616, \"Demons and Spirits (~uslim).\"] In secular lore the cherubim have been called \"black cherubim\" (Dante), \"young-eyed cherubim*' (Shakespeare), \"helmed cherubim\" (Milton).

An ivory from the collection of a king of Megiddo, circa 1200 B.c.E., reproduced on p. 45 of the Westminster Historical Atlas to the Bibk, shows a Canaanite ruler seated on a throne, \"supported by winged lions with human heads.\" These, say the editors of the Atlas, \"are the imaginary, composite beings which the Israelites called cherubim.\" As winged beasts with human heads, 2 cherubim are shown supporting the throne of Hiram, king of A-D of Irrterpreter's Dictiorrary ofthe Bible).

Enoch was transformed into the angel Metatron; Elijah into Sandalphon (although there is a legend that Elijah was an angel from the very beginning : \"one of the greatest and mightiest of the fiery angel host\"). Another legend relates that Elijah fought the angel of death, subdued him, and would have annihilated him but for the interven- tion of God (Who had, it seems, further use for the angel of death-at least, for this particular one). In Talmud there is a similar tale relating to Moses' encounter with an angel of death-in fact, with several of them. Malachi 4: 5 prophesies that Elijah would be the forerunner of the Messiah. In Luke, Elijah appears with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration, in conversation with Jesus. In Heaven, according to Pirke Rabbi Eliezer, Elijah is the \"psychopomp whose duty is to stand at the crossways of Paradise and guide the pious to their appointed places.\" The hasidic Rabbi Elimelekh of Lizhensk (d. 1786) referred to Elijah after his transfiguration as the \"Angel of the Covenant\" (q.v.).

The possible exceptions are I Chronicles 21 and I1 Samuel 24, where Satan seems to emerge as a distinct personality and is identified by name; but scholars are inclined to believe that in these 2 instances the definite article was inadvertently omitted in translation and that the original read 1 L the satan,\" i.e., \"the adversary.\" In the New Testament, specifically in Revelation 12, the notion of a fallen angel and of fallen angels is spelt out: \"And his [the dragon's or Satan's] tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven [angels] and did cast them to earth . . . and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him.\" Enoch 1 claims that 200 fell, naming about 19 (allowing for variant spellings and repetitions) and listing 66 chiefs of ten,\" the most prominent among them being Semyaza, Azazel, Sariel, Rumiel, Danjal, Turel, Kokabel.

As opposed to the contention that angels fell from each of the 9 orders, an opinion backed by papal authority holds that only the angels of the 10th (sic) order fell. The question is, which of the 9 orders is the 10th. [See Moore's The Loves of the Angels, p. 155.1 In this book, Moore quotes Tertullian (De Habitu Mulieb) to the effect that all the chief luxuries of female adornment and enticement-\"the neck- laces, armlets, rouge, and the black powder for the eye-lashes\" are to be traced to the researches and discoveries of the fallen angels. After the apostate angels fell, \"the rest were confirmed in the perseverance of eternal beatitude,\" as Isidor of Seville assures us in his Sententiae-although Bible references to God's finding his angels (long after the Fall) untrustworthy point to a contrary conclusion. The cause of Satan's downfall has commonly been attributed to the sin of pride or of ambition (\"by that sin fell the angels\"). Another explanation sometimes offered with regard to the origin of fallen angels goes back to Genesis 6, where the sons of God (angels) \"saw the daughters of men . . . and took them wives\" from among them. Enoch saw 7 great stars like burning mountains which (so Enoch's guide told him) were being punished because they failed to rise at the appointed time. In other early writings, fallen angels were said to be shooting stars. Aquinas identified the fallen angels with demons. The Christian writers of the later Middle Ages looked upon all heathen divinities as demons. In most sources, the leader of the apostates is Satan, but in apocryphal writings the leader has also been called Mastema, Beliar (Beliel), Azazel, Belzebub, Sammael, etc. In Mohammedan lore he is Iblis. In Levi 3 (Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs) the fallen angels are \"imprisoned in the 2nd Heaven.\" Enoch 11, 7: 1 also speaks of the fallen angels in the 2nd Heaven as \"prisoners suspended [there], reserved for [and] awaiting the eternal judgment.\" '6 In most Jewish literature,\" says Caird in Principal- ities and Powers, \"it was on account of mankind that the angels fell,\" and cites the Apocalypse of Baruch which goes so far as to say that it was \"the physical nature of man which not only became a danger to his own soul, but resulted in the fall of the angels.\" According to legend (Budge, Amulets and Talismans) the rebel angels fell for 9 days.

In the Universal Starldard E~icyclopaedia the 4 are given as Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Suriel (the last name being equated with Raphael). According to Arabic traditional lore, the 4 are: Gabriel, angel of revelation; Michael, who fights the battle of faith; Azrael, angel of death; and Israfel, who will sound the trumpet at the Resurrection. Fourcas [Forcas] Four Spirits of the Heaven-angels in the guise of black, white, grizzled, and bay horses \"which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth\" (Zechariah 6). The horses, har- nessed to chariots, were shown to the Old Testa- ment prophet by an angel (unnamed). In rabbinic lore, Zechariah, 300 years before Daniel, had already graded angels according to rank, but did not name them. It is said, further, that Zechariah drew his inspiration for the \"seven eyes of the Lord\" (Zechariah 4) from the Parsee archangels, the amesha spentas. Fourth Angel, The-John, in Revelation 8, speaks of the 4th angel as one of the 7 angels of wrath who sound trumpets. When the trumpet of the 4th angel is sounded, a 3rd part of the sun is smitten, and a 3rd part of the moon, and a 3rd part of the stars. Fourth Heaven-the abode of Shamshiel, Sapiel, Zagzagel, and Michael. According to Talmud Hagiga 12, it contained the heavenly Jerusalem, the temple, and the altar.

He is the angel of annunciation, resurrection, mercy, vengeance, death, revelation. Apart fiom Michael, he is the only angel mentioned by name in the Old Testa- ment-unless we include among the Old Testa- ment books the Book of Tobit, usually considered apocryphal, in which case Raphael, who appears there, becomes the 3rd-named angel in Scripture (but see Gustav Davidson's article \"The Named Angels in Scripture,\" wherein no less than 7 angels are named). Gabriel presides over Paradise, and although he is the ruling prince of the 1st Heaven, he is said to sit on the left-hand side of God (whose dwelling is popularly believed to be the 7th Heaven, or the 10th Heaven). Mohammed claimed it was Gabriel (Jibril in Islamic) of the \"140 pairs of wings\" who dictated to him the Koran, Jura by sura. To the Mohammedans, Gabriel is the spirit of truth. In Jewish legend it was Gabriel who dealt death and destruction to the sinful cities of the plain (Sodom and Gommorah among them). And it was Gabriel who, according to Talmud San- hedrin 95b, smote Sennacherib's hosts \"with a sharpened scythe which had been ready since Creation.\" Elsewhere in Talmud it is Gabriel who, it is said, prevented Queen Vashti from appearing naked before King Ahasuerus and his guests in order to bring about the election of Esther in her place.

The incident is pictured in a woodcut in the famous Cologne Bible. Cabalists identify Gabriel as \"the man clothed in linen\" (Exekiel 9, 10 ff.). In Daniel 10- 11 this man clothed in linen is helped by Michael. In rabbinic literature, Gabriel is the prince of justice [Rf: Cordovero, Palm Tree of Deborah, p. 56.1 Origen in De Principiis I, 81, calls Gabriel the angel of war. Jerome equates Gabriel with Hamon (q.v.). According to Milton (Paradise Lost IV, 549) Gabriel is chief of the angelic guards placed over Paradise. As for the incident of the 3 holy men (Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah) who were rescued from the furnace, it was Gabriel, according to Jewish legend, who performed this miracle. Other sources credit Michael. Gabriel is likewise identified as the man-God-angel who wrestled with Jacob at Peniel, although Michael, Uriel, Metatron, Samael, and Chamuel have also been put forward as \"the dark antagonist.\" Rembrandt did a canvas of the celebrated encounter. A Mo- hammedan legend, growing out of the Koran, sura 20, 88, relates that when the dust from the hoofprints of Gabriel's horse was thrown into the mouth of the Golden Calf, the Calf at once became animated. According to the Etlcyclopaedia of Islan~ I, 502, Mohammed confused Gabriel with the Holy Ghost-a confusion understand- able or explainable by virtue of the conflicting accounts in Matthew 1 : 20 and Luke 1 : 26 where, in the 1st instance, it is the Holy Ghost that begets Mary with Child and, in the 2nd instance, it is Gabriel who \"came in unto her,\" and also then informs her that she \"had found favor with the Lord\" and \"would conceive in her womb.\" In Bamberger's Fallen Angels, p. 109, quoting a Babylonian legend, Gabriel once fell into disgrace \"for not obeying a command exactly as given, and remained for a while outside the heavenly Curtain.\" During this period the guardian angel of Persia, Dobiel, acted as Gabriel's proxy. The name Gabriel is of Chaldean origin and was unknown to the Jews prior to the Captivity. In the original listing of 119 angels of the Parsees, Gabriel's name is missing. Gabriel is the preceptor angel of Joseph. In Midrash Eleh Exkerah, Gabriel figures in the tale of the legendary 10 Martyrs (Jewish sages). One of these 10, Rabbi Ishmael ascends to Heaven and asks Gabriel why they merit death. Gabriel replies that they are atoning for the sin of the 10 sons of Jacob who sold Joseph into slavery. According to the court testimony of Joan of Arc, it was Gabriel who inspired her to go to the succor of the King of France. In more recent times, Gabriel figures as the angel who visited Father George Rapp, leader of the 2nd Advent community in New Harmony, Indiana, and left his footprint on a limestone slab preserved in the yard of the Maclure-Owen residence in that city. Longfellow's The Golden Legend makes Gabriel the angel of the moon who brings man the gift of hope.

As reported in 3 Enoch, they each have \"4 faces, 4 wings, 2,000 thrones, and are placed next to the wheels of the Merkabah.\" Ezekiel saw the hayyoth (cherubim) by the river Chebar (Ezekiel 20). According to The Zohar (Vayigash 21 la) there are 36 hayyoth- although, in 3 Enoch, they number only 4.

The Zohar (Exodus 128a), translates the word to mean beautiful virgins. The term \"hechaloth\" also denotes the heavenly halls or palaces guarded over by the great warden angels. It should be pointed out that these emanations are from the right side of the Creator. There are also unholy emanations (the unholy sefiroth, the averse ones) and these issue from His left side (the dark or evil side). For a listing of both choirs, see Appendix. The Book of Hechaloth, originally published by Jellinek, was reissued by Odeberg as 3 Elloch or The Hebrew Book ofEnoch. See Hechaloth for an angel so named.

Generally speaking, angels can have no off- spring, since they are pure spirits; but when angels sin, when they \"put on the corruptibility of the flesh\" and cohabit with mortal women, they are capable of producing progeny.

According to The Zohar I, Hemah, with the help of a brother angel named Af, well- nigh swallowed Moses, and would have succeeded in doing so, but for the timely intervention of God. When the Lawgiver was disgorged, he turned around and slew Hemah-one of the rare instances where a mortal was able to do away with an immortal, an angel. Like Af, Hemah was 500 parasangs tall, and was \"forged out of chains of black and red fire,\" as described in Ginzberg, The Legends ofthe Jews 11, 308. Heman (\"trustH)-according to Rabbi Judah in The Zohar (Kedoshim) and according to 3 Enoch, Heman is a leader of one of the heavenly choirs. Heman and the angels under him sing hosannas in the morning hours, just as those under Jeduthun sing hosannas in the evening hours, and those under Asaph sing at night. Psalm 88 is headed: \"To the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.\" In the course of time, it seems that the 3 psalmists (Heman, Asaph, and Jeduthun) were transformed into maestro- angels in order to perform, in Heaven, services for which they showed special skill on earth.

Earlier sources may yet come to light. The name appears also in the grimoires, as in the 1st pentacle of the planet Mars, figured in Mathers, The Greater Key of Solomon, p. 63.

She pre- dated Eve, had marital relations with Adam, and must thus be regarded as our first parent's 1st wife. According to Rabbi Eliezer (The Book ofAdam and Eve), Lilith bore Adam every day 100 children. The Zohar (Leviticus 19a) describes Lilith as \"a hot fiery female who at first cohabited with man\" but, when Eve was created, \"flew to the cities of the sea coast,\" where she is \"still trying to ensnare mankind.\" She has been identified (incorrectly) with the screech owl in Isaiah 34: 14. In the cabala she is the demon of Friday and is represented as a naked woman whose body terminates in a serpent's tail. While commonly regarded as the creation of the rabbis of the early Middle Ages (the first traceable mention of Lilith occurs in a IOth-century folktale called the Alphabet of Ben Sira), Lilith is in fact drawn from the lili, female demonic spirits in Mesopotamian demonology, and known as ardat lili.

It should be pointed out that the authors of the books of the Old Testament knew nothing of fallen or evil angels, and do not mention them, although, at times, as in Job 4:18, the Lord \"put no trust'' in his angels and \"charged them with folly,\" which would indicate that angels were not all that they should be. The name Lucifer was applied to Satan by St. Jerome and other Church Fathers. Milton in Paradise Lost applied the name to the demon of sinful pride. Lucifer is the title and principal character of the epic poem by the Dutch Shakes- peare, Vondel (who uses Lucifer in lieu of Satan), and a principal character in the mystery play by Imre Madach, The Tragedy ofMun.

In The Zohar I, Metatron is spoken of as Moses' rod, \"from one side of which comes life and from the other, death.\" In Eisenmenger, Traditions of the Jews 11, 408, Metatron is indeed the supreme angel of death, to whom God daily gives orders as to the souls to be \"taken\" that day. These orders Meta- tron transmits to his subordinates Gabriel and Sammael. That Metatron was considered, at least in some sources, mightier than either Michael or Gabriel is the view expressed in the Chronicles of Jerahmeel. Here the story goes that whereas neither of the two great Biblical angels was able to eject Jannes and Jambres, the Egyptian wizards, from Heaven (whither they managed, it seems, to ascend by witchcraft), Metatron was able to accom- plish their expulsion. In Yalkut Hadash, also; Metatron is said to be \"appointed over Michael and Gabriel.\" As for the size or height of Meta- tron, The Zohar computes it to be \"equal to the breadth of the whole world.\" In rabbinic lore, this was the size of Adam before he sinned. One of Metatron's secret names is Bizbul (according to the Visions ofEzekiel where, however, the meaning of this name is not given). King, The Gnostics attd Their Remains, p. 15, says of Metatron: \"This is the Persian Mithra.\" Many other sources, sup porting this identification, are cited by Odeberg, 3 Enoch. In Jewish angelology, Metatron is \"the angel who caused another angel to announce, before the Flood, that God would destroy the world.\" [Rf. Jewish Encyclopedia, \"Metatron,\" vol. 8.1 Among numerous other missions or deeds credited to Metatron is the staying of Abraham's hand on the point of sacrificing Isaac. But this 11th-hour intercession has also been imputed to Michael, Zadkiel, Tadhiel, and of course to the \"angel of the Lord,\" who is the one designated in Genesis 22. Finally, according to Talmud Abodah ~arajl3b. Metatron is the \"teacher of prematurely dead children in Paradise.\" Metrator-\"a most holy angelw invoked in magical operations. The specific conjuration is the one \"concerning the Needle and other Iron Instruments,\" during which the invocant is advised to recite versicles from Psalms 31, 42.

The Sixth and Sevettth Books ofMoses.1 Michael(\"who is as God\")-in Biblical and post- Biblical lore, Michael ranks as the greatest of all angels, whether in Jewish, Christian, or Islamic writings, secular or religious. He derives originally from the Chaldeans by whom he was worshipped as something of a god. He is chief of the order of virtues, chief of archangels, prince of the presence, angel of repentance, righteousness, mercy, and sanctification; also ruler of the 4th Heaven, tutelary sar (angelic prince) of Israel, guardian of Jacob, conqueror of Satan (bearing in mind, how- ever, that Satan is still very much around and un- vanquished), etc. His mystery name is Sabbathiel. In Islamic writings he is called Mika'il. As the deliverer of the faithful he accords, in the Avesta, with Saosyhant the Redeemer. Midrash Rabba (Exodus 18) credits Michael with being the author of the whole of Psalm 85. In addition, he has been identified with the angel who destroyed the hosts of Sennacherib (a feat also ascribed to the prowess of Uriel, Gabriel, Ramiel) and as the angel who stayed the hand of Abraham when the latter was on the point of sacrificing his son Isaac (a feat also ascribed to Tadhiel, Metatron, and other angels).

According to Talmud Berakot 35, where the comment is on Genesis 18:l-10, Michael is recognized by Sarah as one of 3 \"men\" whom Abraham entertainedun- awares. Legend speaks of Michael having assisted 4 other great angels-Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Metatron-in the burial of Moses, Michael dis- puting with Satan for possession of the body [RJ Jude 9.1 In mystic and occult writings, Michael has often been equated with the Holy Ghost, the Logos, God, Metatron, etc. In Baruch 111, Michael \"holds the keys of the kingdom of Heavenw- which, traditionally, and in the popular image, applies more aptly to St. Peter. In Hastings, Eitcyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics IV, 616, the article \"Demons and Spirits\" speaks of the earliest traditions in Muslim lore as locating Michael in the 7th Heaven \"on the borders of the Full Sea, crowded with an innumerable array of angels\"; and after describing Michael's wings as \"of the color of green emerald,\" goes on to say that he \"is covered with saffron hairs, each of them containing a million faces and mouths and as many tongues which, in a million dialects, in~plore the pardon of Allah.\" In ancient Persian lore, Michael was called Beshter, \"one who provides sustenance for mankind,\" which would equate him with Meta- tron. [Rf. Sale, The Korati, \"Preliminary Dis- course.\"] Here it is revealed that the cherubim were formed from the tears Michael shed over the sins ofthe faithful. Christians invoke Michael as St. Michael, the benevolent angel of death, in the sense of deliverance and immortality, and for leading the souls of the faithful \"into the eternal light.\" To the Jews, according to Rigamey, What Is an Angel?, Michael is the \"viceroy of Heaven\" (a title applied to the great adversary ha-Satan, before the latter fell). With Gabriel, Michael is the most commonly pictured angel in the work of the classic masters. He is depicted most often as winged, with unsheathed sword, the warrior of God and slayer of the Dragon (a role later apportioned to St. George). As the angel of the final reckoning and the weigher of souls (an ofice he shares with Dokiel, Zehanpuryu, and others) he holds in his hand the scales of justice. Fra Filippo Lippi, in a sketch reproduced on p. 436 in Jameson, Legends ofthe Madonna, shows Michael kneeling and offering a taper, as the angel who announces to Mary her approaching death (it was Gabriel who announced the birth of the Virgin's God-child). On p. 433 of the same book an orien- tal legend is recalled which tells of Michael having cut off the hands of \"a wicked Jewish high priest\" who had attempted to overturn the bier of the just-deceased Virgin; however, the hands of the \"audacious Jew\" were reunited to his body at the intercession of St. Peter. Among the recently discovered Dead Sea scrolls there is one titled the War ofthe Sons ofLight Against the Sons ofDarkness. Here Michael is called the \"Prince of Light.\" He leads the angels of light in battle against the legions of the angels of darkness, the latter under the command of the demon Belial. In Ginzberg, The Legends ofthe Jews, ~ichael is regarded as the forerunner of the Shekinah (9.v.) ; as the angel who brought Asenath from Palestine as a wife to Joseph; as the one who saved Daniel's companions from the fire; as the intermediary between Mor- decai and Ekther; as the destroyer of Babylon, etc.,"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"[I961 MIGHTS / MIVON Mights-another term for the order of virtues (q.~.), as used by Benjamin Camfield in his Theological Discourse qf Angels.

In Excerpts of Theodotus, the powers are said to be \"the first of created angels.\" Milton in Paradise Lost XI, 221, uses the term as the equivalent of the order ofguards (XII, 590). Powers of Glory-a term for angels in The Testamerit of the Twelve Patriarchs (Judah 25), where it is equated with the angel of the pres- ence, the sun, moon, and stars, as one of the heavenly luminaries. Prajapati-to be compared with the Rishis who are, it is said, the 7 or 10 Vedic spirits from whom all mankind is descended. They are also to be compared with the 7 angels of the presence and the 7 (or 6) amesha spentas in Zoroastrian lore.

Raguel is an angel of earth, a guard of the 2nd (or 4th) Heaven. He \"takes vengeance on the world of luminaries,\" which is interpreted to mean that, for cause, he brings other angels to account. Great as Raguel is, he was reprobated at a church council in Rome in 745 c.E., along with other high-ranking angels, Uriel among them. In Hugo, The Toilers of the Sea, Raguhel (so spelt) is a demon who \"passed himself off as a saint\" whom Pope Zachary in 745 C.E. \"unearthed and turned out of the saintly calendar, along with two other demons called Oribel and Tobiel.\" [See Tubuas.] In The Revela- tion ofJohn, Tischendorf, who edits this New Testa- ment apocryphon, gives an extract from the termination of MS. E: \"Then shall He 'send the angel Raguel, saying: Go and sound the trumpet for the angels of cold and snow and ice, and bring together every kind of wrath upon them that stand on the left.\" This would occur after the separation of the sheep from the goats. In gnostic- ism, Rapel is equated with Thelesis, another great angel (q.v.). According to Enoch II, Raguel (as Raguil or Rasuil or Samuil) is the angel who trans- ported Enoch to Heaven while the antediluvian patriarch was still in the flesh-an incident alluded to in Genesis 5: 24. The feat of transporting Enoch is also credited to Anafiel (q.v.).

In The Legends of thelews I, 385, Raphael is the angel sent by God to cure Jacob of the injury to his thigh when Jacob wrestled with his dark adversary at Peniel (the adversary having been identified variously as Michael, Metatron, Uriel, Sammael or God Himself.) Another legend (Sefer Noah) claims it was Raphael who handed Noah, after the flood, a \"medical book,\" which may have been the famous Sefer Raziel (The Book ofthe Atgel Raziel). Among other high offices, Raphael is the regent of the sun (Longfellow refers to him as the angel of the sun), chief of the order of virtues, governor of the south, guardian of the west, ruling prince of the 2nd Heaven, overseer of the evening winds, guardian of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, one of the 6 angels of repentance, angel of prayer, love, joy, and light. Above all, he is, as his name denotes, the angel of healing (~f. Aslepios, ancient Greek god of healing). He is also the angel of science and knowledge, and the preceptor angel of Isaac. [RJ Barrett, The Magus 11.1 Raphael belongs to at least 4 of the celestial orders: seraphim, cherubim, dominions (or domi- nations), powers. According to Trithemius of Spanheim, the 15th-century occultist, Raphael is one of the 7 angels of the Apocalypse. He is also numbered among the 10 holy sefiroth. And while he is not specifically named as the angel who trou- bled the waters at the ~ool in ancient ~ethesda (John 5), he is generally so credited. [Rf: Summers, The Vampire in Europe.] Curiously enough (be- cause, perhaps, Raphael has been called a guide in Hell) an ophite diagram represents ~a~hael as a terrestrial daemon with a beastlike form (!) and is associated with 3 other angels: Michael, Suriel, and Gabriel in the same guise. [RJ Legge, Forerunners and Rivals of Christianity 11, p. 70.1 In the canvases of such masters as Botticini, Lorrain, Pollajuolo, Ghirlandaio, Titian, and Rembrandt, ~a~hael is variously pictured holding a pilgrim's staff and a fish (Tobit) ; as a winged saint supping with Adam and Eve; as the \"sociable archangelv (Paradise"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Raphael descending to earth.

Reference to these 7 angels of the presence is made by Blake in his \"Milton.\" In the off-Broadway play Tobias atad the Angel, Raphael is represented as a scoffing and jesting angel \"knocking sense into the head of Tobias.\" The file on Raphael is inexhaustible, but one additional legend may be worth repeating here: it is taken from Conybeare, The Testarrient of Solonron. When Solomon prayed to God for help in the building of the Temple, God answered with the gift of a magic ring brought to the Hebrew king personally by Raphael. The ring, engraved with the pentalpha (5-pointed star), had the power to subdue all demons. And it was with the \"slave labor\" of demons that Solomon was able to complete the building of the Temple.

Gaster, The Sword of Moses.] In the cabala, Raziel is the personification of Cochma (divine wisdom), 2nd of the 10 holy sefiroth. In rabbinic lore, Raziel is the legendary author of The Book of the Ailgel Raziel (Sefer Raziel), \"wherein all celestial and earthly know- ledge is set down.\" The true author is unknown but he has been conimonly identified as Eleazer of Worms or Isaac the Blind, medieval writers. Legend has it that the angel Raziel handed his book to Adam, and that the other angels, out of envy, ~urloined the precious grimoire and cast it into the sea, whereat God ordered Rahab, pri- mordial angel/demon of the deep, to fish it out and restore it to Adam-which Rahab obediently did, although it should be pointed out that before this, Rahab had been destroyed. The Book of the Aiigel Raziel finally came into possession of, first, Enoch (who, it is said, gave it out as his own work i.e., The Book of Eiloch); then of Noah; then of Solomon, the latter deriving from it, according to dem~no~raphers, his great knowledge and power in magic.

In this Briatic world each sefira is allotted an archangel to govern it, the chief being Metatron, the others being, apart from Raziel, Tzaphkiel, Tzadquiel, Kamael, Michael, Haniel, Raphael, Gabriel, and Sandalphon-as we find in a listing by Macgregor Mathers, [Rf. Westcott, The Study ofthe Kabalah, pp. 54-55.] According to Maimonides in his Mishna Thora, Raziel is chief of the order of erelim (q.v.) ; also, the herald of deity and preceptor angel of Adam. In further connection with The Book ofthe Angel Raziel, The Zohar I, 55a, reports that in the middle of the book there occurs a secret writing \"explaining the 1,500 keys [to the mystery of the world] which were not revealed even to the holy angels.\" The noted 13th-century cabalist Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia wrote under the name of Raziel (also under the name of Zechariah).

The bishops Clement and Adalbert, who taught the veneration of these angels, were convicted of heresy. It was the rash of newly coined angels that prompted the Church at that time to forbid invoking or venerating angels other than those named in the Bible (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael).

In rabbinic literature, Samael is chief of the Satans and the angel of death. In the Secrets of Enoch (Enoch II) he is the prince of demons and a magician. Samael has been regarded both as evil and good; as one of the greatest and as one of the foulest spirits opera- ting in Heaven, on earth, and in Hell. On the one hand he is said to be chief ruler of the 5th Heaven (in Jewish legendary lore his residence is usually placed in the 7th Heaven), one of the 7 regents of the world served by 2 million angels; on the other hand, he is \"that great serpent with 12 wings that draws after him, in his fall, the solar system.\" [Cf: Revelation 12.1 Samael is also the angel of death (one of a number of such angels) whom God sent to fetch the soul of Moses when the Lawgiver's days on earth had come to an end. Talmud Yalkut I, 110, speaks of Samael as ~sau's guardian angel. Sotah lob speaks of Samael as Edom's sar (angelic prince guardian). In the Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer, Samael is charged with being the one (in the guise of a serpent) who tempted Eve, seduced her, and became by her the father of Cain. In The Zohar (Vayishlah 170b), Samael is the dark angel who wrestled with Jacob at Peniel, although Michael, Uriel, Metatron, and others have been identified as this antagonist. Samael is also equated with the satan (i.e., the adversary) who tempted David to number Israel [Rf. I Chronicles 211. TargumJonathan to the Prophets renders Genesis 3: 6 6' as: And the woman saw Samael the angel of death.\" This verse is translated in the Paraphrase oflob, 28: 7, as: \"the path of the Tree of Life which Samael, who flies like a bird, did not know, and which the eye of Eve did not perceive.\" In Waite, The Holy Kabbalah, p. 255, Samael is characterized as the \"severity of God\" and is listed as 5th of the archangels of the world of Briah. Here he corres- ponds to the sefira Geburah. Cornelius Agrippa, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, equates Samael with the Greek god Typhon. Baruch III,4, men- tions \"the angel Sammael.\" In Charles, The Ascension of Isaiah IV, 7, occurs this passage: \"And we ascended to the firmament, I and he [i.e., Isaiah and his escorting angel, a very glorious one, not named-but compare with the angel that Abraham encounters in the Apocalypse ofAbraham], and there I saw Sammael and his hosts, and there was great fighting therein and the angels of Satan were envying one another.\" It is clear here that Sammael and Satan are interchangeable. In Longfellow's extensive poem, The Golden Legend, when the rabbi asks Judas Iscariot why the dogs howl at night, the answer is: In the Rabbinical book it sayeth/The dogs howl when, with icy breath,/Great Sammael, the Angel $ Death,/Takes through the town his Jight. In fiction, \"Red Samael the Seducer,\" father of the hero, is a character in Cabell, The Devil's Own Dear Son. Cabell calls Samael the \"youngest and most virile of the 72 princes of Hell, a red-headed rogue who had made his reputation some centuries ago with both Eve and Lilith.\" To Cabell, Samael belongs to the order of seraphim and is ''first of the art critics.\""},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"[256] SAMAHA'IL / SANTRIEL Samaha'il-in Muslim tradition, an angel in Sam Hii (Shom Hii)-in Mandaean lore, one the 6th Heaven in charge of a group of angels (in of the 4 malki (uthri or angels) of the North Star. the guise of boys) engaged in worshipping Allah.

Exceeding Hadraniel in height by a 500-year foot journey, he is regarded as one of the tallest hierarchs in the celestial realms-Moses, sighting him in the 3rd Heaven, called him \"the tall angel.\" Talmud Hagiga 13b says his head reaches Heaven (which was said also of Israfel and of the Greek giant Typhon). In Mathers, The Greater Key of Solomon, Sandalphon is designated \"the left-hand feminine cherub of the ark.\" In the liturgy for the Feast of Tabernacles, he is credited with gathering the prayers of the faithful, making a garland of such prayers, and then \"adjuring them to ascend as an orb to the supreme King of Kings.\" In 3 Enoch, Sandalphon is described as ruler of the 6th Heaven (makon) but, in The Zohar (Exodus 202b), he is \"chief of the 7th Heaven.\" According to Islamic lore, he dwells in the 4th Heaven. As is reported of Michael, he carries on ceaseless combat with the apparently indestructible Samael (Satan), prince of evil. In popular etymology, Sandalphon is a fancier of sandals (soft shoes) when he stands in the presence of his Maker, but leather shoegear when he appears before the Shekinah (see The Zohar).

In other Old Testament books (Job, I Chronicles, Psalms, Zechariah) the term likewise designates an ofice; and the angel investing that ofice is not apostate or fallen. He becomes such starting in early New Testament times and writings, when he emerges as Satan (capital S), the prince of evil and enemy of God, and is character- ized by such titles as \"prince of this world\" (John 16:ll) and \"prince of the power of the air\" (Ephesians 2:2). When Peter was rebuked by Jesus, he was called Satan (Luke 4:8). Reading back into Genesis, medieval writers like Peter Lombard (c. 1100-1160) saw Satan in the guise of the serpent tempting Eve, although other writers, like the 9th-century Bishop Agobard, held that Satan tempted Eve through the serpent. As Langton says in Satan, A Portrait: \"In the later Jewish literature, Satan and the serpent are either identified, or one is made the vehicle of the other.\" Originally, Satan (as ha-satan) was a great angel, chief of the seraphim, head of the order of virtues. While seraphim were usually pictured as 6-winged, Satan was shown as 12-winged. Gregory the Great in his Moralia, after listing the 9 hierarchic orders, pays this tribute to Satan: \"he wore all of them [all the angels] as a garment, transcending all in glory and knowledge.\" Talmud claims that Satan was created on the 6th day of Creation (Bereshith Rabba, 17). Through a misreading of Isaiah 14:12, he has been identified with Lucifer. To Aquinas, Satan, as \"the first angel who sinned\" is not a seraph but a cherub, the argument being that \"cherubim is [sic] derived from knowledge, which is compatible with mortal sin; but seraphim is [sic] derived from the heat of charity, which is incomp,tible with mortal sin\" (Summa I, 7th art., reply obj. 1). In time, according to Jerome, Gregory of Nyssa, Origen, Ambrosiaster, and others, Satan will be reinstated in his \"pristine splendor and original rank.\" This is also cabalistic doctrine. In secular lore, Satan figures in many works, notably in Milton's Paradise Lost, where he is chief of rebels and the \"Arch Angel ruin'd\" (I, 593) and in Paradise Regained, where he is the \"Thief of Paradise\" (IV, 604). Also in Vondel's Lucijr; in Dryden's The State ofbrlrocence; and in Goethe's Faust (where he is represented by Mephistopheles). Other names for Satan include Mastema, Beliar or Beliel, Duma, Gadreel, Azazel, Sammael, angel of Edom. In rabbinic lore he has a nickname \"the ugly one\" (Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews V, 123). In Midrash Tehillim Satan appears to David (when the latter was out hunting) in the form of a gazelle. Compare with figure of Mutabilitie (as conceived by Spenser in \"Two Cantos of Mutabilitie\" in The Fairie Satan bound for a thousand years by the angel of the abyss (Appollyon/Abaddon), a 17th- century illustration of I Revelation 20.

[Sathariel] Shekinah (Hebrew, shachan, meaning \"to residew-Schechinah, Matrona, etc.)-the female manifestation of God in man, the divine itiwoht~un~ (indwelling). Also, the \"bride of the Lord,\" compatible with the shakti of Shiva. The expres- sion \"the Shekinah rests\" is used as a paraphrase for \"God dwells.\" In Genesis 48:16 \"the Angel which redeemed me from all evil,\" uttered by Israel (Jacob), applies to the Shekinah, according to The Zohar (Balak 187a). In the New Testament sense, the Shekinah is the glory emanating from God, His effulgence. The passage in Matthew 18:20 is translated by C. W. Emmet (in Hastings, Dictionary of the Bible) to read: \"when two sit together and are occupied with the word of the Law, the Shekinah is with him.\" As interpreted by Rabbi Johanan (Midrash Rabba; Exodus), Michael is the glory of the Shekinah. The Shekinah is the liberating Angel, manifesting in her male aspect as Metatron. In the cabala, she is the 10th sefira Malkuth, otherwise the Queen. The creation of the world was, according to The Zohar (suppl.), the work of the Shekinah. Here, too, the Shekinah is spoken of as \"abiding in the 12 holy chariots and the 12 supernal hayyoth.\" Elsewhere in The Zohar (Balak-Numbers 187a) she is mentioned as a messenger from on high who, when she first appeared to Moses, was called an angel, just as she was called by Jacob. In The Zohar (Exodus 51a) she is \"the way of the Tree of Life\" and the \"angel of the Lord.\" Maimonides in Moreh Nebuchim regarded the Shekinah as an intermediary between God and the world, or as a periphrasis for God. [RJ: Universal Jewish Encyclopaedia, vol. 9, p. 501..] The Shekinah has been identified with the Holy Ghost and the Epinoia of the gnostic Valentinus. Of her it has been said (Waite, The Holy Kabbalah) \"Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way\" (Exodus 23:20), which has also been applied to Metatron and John the Baptist, \"the forerunner angel.\" According to legend (Ginz- berg, The LPgends of the Jews II, 148 and 200), Aaron died by a kiss from the Shekinah. In the same source (11, 260) it is related that Abraham caused the Shekinah to come down from the 2nd Heaven. And Talmud tells us that when God drove Adam out of the earthly paradise, the Shekinah remained behind \"enthroned above a cherub under the Tree of Life, her splendor being 65,000 times brighter than the sun,\" and that this radiance \"made all upon whom it fell exempt from disease\"; and, further, that then \"neither insects nor demons could come nigh unto such to do them harm.\" An account somewhat at variance with the foregoing is given in Scholem's two works: Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism and Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Tal- mudic Tradition, where it is reported that the Shekinah was sent into exile on Adam's fall and that \"to lead the Shekinah back to God and to unite her with Him is the true purpose of the Tor- ah.\" A reference to the dwelling place of the Shekinah occurs in Canticles Rabba 6: \"The ori- ginal abode of the Shekinah was among the tahtonim [that is, among the lower ones: human beings, earth]. When Adam sinned, it [the abode] ascended to the 1st Heaven. With Cain's sin, it ascended to the 2nd Heaven. With Enoch's, to the 3rd. With the generation of the Flood, to the 4th. With the generation of the Tower of Babel, to the 5th. With the Sodomites, to the 6th. With the sin of the Egyptians in the days of Abraham, to the 7th.\" Corresponding to these, there arose 7 righteous men who brought the Shekinah back to earth again. They were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehath (Levi's son and ~oses' grandfather), Amram, and Moses. A haggadah about the Shek- inah is that she hovers over all conjugal unions between Jewish husbands and wives and blesses such unions with her presence.

In Elloch I, he is the angel who \"watches over thunder and terror.\" In The Book ofAdam and Eve he presides over repentance. Uriel \"is supposed to be,\" says Abbot Anscar Vonier in The Teaching ofthe Catholic Church, \"the spirit who stood at the gate of the lost Eden with the fiery sword.\" The Book of Adam and Eve designates him as this spirit, i.e., one of the \"cherubims\" of Genesis 3. He is invoked in some of the ancient litanies. He has been identified as one of the angels who helped bury Adam and Abel in Paradise (Hastings, Dictionary of the Bible); as the dark angel who wrestled with Jacob at Peniel; as the destroyer of the hosts of Sennacherib (I1 Kings 19 : 35 ; I1 Maccabees 15 : 22) ; as the messenger sent by God to Noah to warn him of the impend- ing deluge (Enoch I, 10: 1-3). all of which feats or missions have been credited to other angels, as elsewhere noted. In the view of Louis Ginzberg, the \"prince of lightsw in The Manual of Discipline refers to Uriel. In addition, Uriel is said to have disclosed the mysteries of the heavenly arcana to Ezra; interpreted prophecies, and led Abraham out of Ur. In later Judaism, says R. H. Charles (The Book of Enoch), \"we frnd Uriel instead of Phanuel\" as one of the 4 angels of the presence. Uriel is also the angel of the month of September and may be invoked ritually by those born in that month. The Magus claims that alchemy \"which is of divine origin\" was brought down to earth by Uriel, and that it was Uriel who gave the cabala to man, although this \"key to the mystical interpretation of Scripture\" is also said to have been the gift of Metatron. Milton describes Uriel as \"Regent of the Sun\" and the \"sharpest sighted spirit of all in Heaven\" (Paradise Lost 111). Dryden, The State oflnnocence, pictures Uriel as descending from heaven in a chariot drawn by white horses. Despite his eminence, Uriel was reprobated at a Church Council in Rome, 745 C.E. Now, however, he is Saint Uriel, and his symbol is an open hand holding a &me. Burne-Jones' painting of Uriel is reproduced as a frontispiece in Duff, First and Second Books offidras. The name Uriel derives, it is claimed, from Uriah the prophet. In apocryphal and occult works Uriel has been equated or identified with Nuriel, Uryan, Jeremiel, Vretil, Suriel, Puruel, Phanuel, Jehoel, Israfel, and the angel Jacob-Lsrael. See the p~eudepi~raphic PIayer ojjoseph, quoted in part in Ginzberg, The Legends ofthejews V, 310. In this work Jacob says: \"When I was coming from Mesopotamia of Syria [sic], Uriel, the angel of God, came forth and spoke: 'I have come down to the earth to make my dwell- ing among men, and I am called Jacob by name.' \" The meaning of the foregoing is puzzling, unless Uriel turned into Jacob after wrestling with the patriarch at Peniel; but the incident as related in Genesis 32 suggests a different interpretation. A commentary on Exodus 4:25 speaks of a \"benign angelw attacking Moses for neglecting to observe the covenantal rite of circumcision with regard to the latter's son Gershom, the benign angel being identified as Uriel in Midrash Aggada Exodus, and as Gabriel in The Zohar I, 93b. The latter source reports that Gabriel \"came down in a flame of fire, having the appearance of a burning serpent,\" with the express purpose of destroying Moses \"because of his sin.\" In The Legends ofthejews 11, 328, the angel here is neither Uriel nor Gabriel but 2 angels, the wicked Hemah and Af.

Uriel, \"gliding through the Ev'n/On a Sun beam\" (Paradise Lost IV, 555) is reproduced on p. 296 from Hayley, The Poetical Works of John Milton. The Uriel in Percy MacKaye's Uriel and Other Poems is not our angel but William Vaughn Moody, American poet and playwright (1869-1910), to whom the title poem is addressed in memory. The most recent appraisal of Uriel is the one offered by Walter Clyde Curry in Milton's Ontology Cos- mology and Physics, where, on p. 93, Professor Curry says of Uriel that he \"seems to be largely a pious but not too perceptive physicist with inclinations towards atomistic philosophy.\" To illustrate in what high esteem Uriel was held, we find him described in the 2nd book of the Sibylline Oracles as one of the \"immortal angels of the undying God\" who, on the day ofjudgment, will \"break the monstrous bars framed of unyielding and unbroken adamant of the brazen gates of Hades, and cast them down straightway, and bring forth to judgment all the sorrowful forms, yea, of the ghosts of the ancient Titans and of the giants, and all whom the flood overtook . . . and all these shall he bring to the judgment seat . . . and set before God's seat.\" Urim (\"illumination\")-a cherub in Klop- stock's poetic drama Der Messias (The Messiah). The Bible meaning of the term is a \"household idol\" and it is almost always used in association with tummin (or thummim), meanirg \"perfec- tion\" and signifying oracles for ascertaining the will of God. The urim and tummin derive from the Babylonian-Chaldean tablets of destiny (\"owned\" by Tiamat, female monster and reputed source of all evil), which were credited with possessing the virtue of casting the fate of men. Aaron, it will be recalled, bore the urim and tummin engraved on his breastplate as the insignia of his office of high priest (see Asser Criel). In Talmud Yoma, the urim and tummin are listed among the 5 holy things found in the First Temple and absent from the Second Temple. The Zohar (Exodus 234b) thus defines and distinguishes the 2 '6 terms: Urim signifies the luminous speculum, which consisted of the engravure of the Divine Name composed of 42 letters by which the world was created; whereas the Thummim consisted of the nonluminous speculum made of the Divine Name as manifested in the 22 letters. The combin- ation of the 2 is thus called Urim and Thummim.\" Milton, Paradise Regained 111, 14, refers to the urim and thummim as \"those oraculous gems/ On Aaron's breast.\" The seal of Yale University incorporates the 2 names in Hebrew characters.

The principal duty of the virtues is to work miracles on earth. They are said to be the chief bestowers of grace and valor. Among the ruling princes of the order are Michael, Raphael, Barbiel, Uzziel, Peliel, and (originally) Satan. In the planet- ary scheme of the Egyptians, and in hermetics, the chief of virtues was Pi-RhC (Pi-RC, q.v.).

They never sleep-which is said like- wise of the irin (q.v.). Originally, according to The Book of Jubilees, the watchers were sent by God to instruct the children of men, but they fell after they descended to earth and started cohabit- ing with mortal women [CJ the \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6.1 In Enoch I there is mention of 7 watch- ers, and here the story is that they fell because they failed to appear on time for certain tasks appor- tioned to them. Some versions in rabbinic and cabalistic lore speak of good and evil watchers, with the good watchers still dwelling in the 5th Heaven, the evil ones in the 3rd Heaven (a kind of Hell-in-Heaven realm). Chief among the good watchers are Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Zerachiel, Gabriel, Remiel; the evil ones include Azazel, Semyaza, Shamshiel, Kokabel, Sariel, Satanil. In the recently discovered A Genesis Apocryphoti, Lamech suspects his wife, Bat-Enosh, of having had relations with one of the watchers (called \"holy ones or fallen angels\") and that Noah is the seed of such a union. Bat-Enosh swears \"by the King of the worlds\" that the fruit is his (Lamech's). The cause of Lamech's suspicion is the fact that when Noah was born, he immediately started conversing with \"the Lord of righteous- ness\" and that his likeness was \"in the likeness of the angels of Heaven.\" Lamech hastens to his father Methuselah for enlightenment. Methuselah in turn appeals to Enoch for the truth. Since the Apocryphon breaks off here, we shall probably never know what Enoch told Methuselah.

The wheels are grouped with the cherubim and the seraphim by Talmudists as a high order of angels (thrones being the closest approximation). The angel Rikbiel is chief of the order. Cornelius Agrippa (as does Milton) identifies or associates the ofanim (wheels) with the cherubim. The Zohar (Exodus 233b) in a footnote ranks wheels as an angelic order \"above that of seraphim.\" Winds-Hebrews 1 :7, in a passage often cited and here given, would indicate that \"winds\" (at least in this usage) denote angels: \"He maketh the winds his angels, and flaming fires his ministers.\" Wisdom (Pistis Sophia)-in Enoch 11, 33, wisdom is hypostatized. God orders wisdom, on the 6th day of Creation, \"to make man of 7 substances.\" In Reider, The Book of Wisdom, wisdom is the \"assessor on God's throne,\" the instrument or divine agent (i.e., angel) \"by which all things were created.\" [CJ the Logos of Philo.] According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \"Angel,\" the term \"angel of the Lord\" frnds a \"counterpart in the personification of wisdom in the Sapiential books, and in at least one passage (Zachariah 3: I) it seems to stand for that son of Man whom Daniel (Daniel 7: 13) saw brought before the Ancient of Days.\" Woman Clothed with the Sun-\"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of 12 stars. And she beLg with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered\" (Revelation 12: 1-2). This is perhaps the only instance in angelology where a heavenly creature is pregnant. From the text, she is the celestial prototype or counterpart of the Virgin Mary, mother of the son of God. According to Heckethorn, The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries (I, 108), the Woman Clothed with the Sun stems from the Egyptian Isis.
