The text was inspired by a series of magickal interactions between the adept andhis wife [1] and then taken as dictation from a discarnate entity.[2] His name was AleisterCrowley and the text has been come to be called Liber AL vel Legis, i.e., the Book of the Law,or Liber AL for short. Its three chapters express a world-view, a life style and a spiritual mode ofattainment. The text, its author or scribe, and the magickal order out of which he emerged haveall been both lauded or repudiated and reviled at one time or another and yet each of them hashad a deep and formative impact on the contemporary (Neo-) Pagan resurgence.Due to a comment made by the scribe forbidding discussion there exist very few commentarieson this work. The scribe wrote several as did two of his students. However, none of thempossessed theological training, nor did any of them possess the benefit of the many years henceof observing the benefits and debilities of working with this text. Furthermore theircommentaries were written for the closed community of the occultists and in their distinctivejargon, rendering the commentaries opaque. This opacity would not be so great a problem if thetext were more accessible to the common interested reader. However, the text itself is written inthe jargon of a particular school of occultists, that of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Itis also speaking in a diction unique to itself and it is only through careful examination of the textthat its true meaning begins to emerge.Having studied and lived with Liber AL and certain other allied texts for the last ten years andhaving engaged in discussion of the text with many who receive from it a radically differentcharacter than I do, at this point in time it is necessary for me to analyze and comment upon thistext. My goal is to place it in the genre of sacred writings, to understand what it has to say and itsimplications for our world, and how it may be applied in religious praxis. While I do not hope tobe exhaustive in my efforts I seek to map out the major elements presented by the text therein.Besides sheer enthusiasm, I am particularly qualified for the project. I too am an adept of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn as well as a practitioner of the forms presented in our text. Ihave studied and practiced Yoga, Sorcery, Tantra, Alchemy, Buddhism and Witchcraft, as wellas a variety of other spiritual practices and disciplines which all come into play in the study of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"this text. Further, this analysis is taking place [1993] in the context of my theological educationwhich public framework I am applying to the text to render it accessible to those who may beinterested in understanding this little explored segment of the Pagan community.Several approaches will be employed to make sense out of the text. The first is to let the textspeak for itself. It defines terms and employs them in ways that create apparent contradictions. Ifwe use structuralist mode of criticism and take the text at its word then certain problematicelements become more explicable. Also some of the jargon simply needs to be unpacked andexplained. This includes explaining the Egyptian symbolism the text employs extensively. Someof this requires an understanding of the historical context in which the text emerged becausemuch, thought not all, of the Egyptology used in the text is peculiar to the Golden Dawn. Ourtext also presents certain philosophic and theological propositions upon which I, and thecommunity of people who value this text, have pondered for the almost ninety years of itsexistence and these interpretations will also be examined and their implications explored in thelight of practical theology.However, to break through the ring of occult thinking that has surrounded and isolated this textfrom proper criticism and hence valuation by the educated public, I plan to analyze Liber AL byinterpreting it as a symbolic embodiment of the principles of Alfred North Whitehead’sPhilosophy of Organism. This philosophy and its implicit theology resonate deeply with LiberAL and may provide a way for the public to penetrate AL’s esoteric silence. I will root thisanalysis on the proposition that Whitehead and Crowley both were intuiting a similar characterin experience, and each expressed it in the language they were most familiar, thus there shouldbe a correlation possible between them.This correlation also has the potential to be bilateral. Liber AL may provide an affect-filledexpression of the notions of process thought rendering them more accessible to those who do notwish to labor through Whitehead’s prose. Thus one text may illuminate the other. The potentialfor formulating religious praxis, especially ritual, meditation and contemplative techniques usingthe affect-laden symbols of one source grounded with the meaning-rich metaphysics of the otherengenders much hope in me for the success of each respective tradition.My further researches has indicated that yet another strand needs to be woven into thisexploration to interpret Liber AL: Tibetan Buddhism. As Liber AL comes out of a magickaltradition, so does the Tibetan Buddhist and some of its values and choices of symbols aredictated by the empirical ways of magick. My studies of Tibetan Buddhism seem to indicate tome that Liber AL may be best interpreted as being of the genre called ‘tantra’. Due to thecircumstances surrounding its generation Liber AL exhibits certain similarities to the Tibetanphenomenon called a ‘terma’ or ‘treasure’. These are usually texts or sometimes objects thatpreserve and transmit practices and insights that are hidden until the time in which they areneeded and when they are discovered. Sometimes these texts are ‘discovered’ when a discarnateentity, such as a Buddha or Dakini, dictates them to some human who then shares the text withothers. This may be what we are seeing in Liber AL. To treat our text in this manner may presenta normative context within which it may be interpreted along side similar texts, complete withappropriate cautions and safe-guards absent in the western tradition where this kind of text is anovelty."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Canonical QuestionOne important frame necessary to approach Liber AL vel Legis is the set of normative beliefsabout the text and its message. With this text there is a problem with interpreting it simply andwithout critical analysis. As Hadit says in chapter II, v. 27, \"There is great danger in me; for whodoth not understand these runes shall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit calledBecause, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.\"The most immediate problematic element is the misinterpretation of the principle of Thelema,‘Do what thou Wilt’. All too often this is simply seen as ‘Do your whim’. Fortunately, on thebasis of the other discussions incorporated in this analysis this interpretation is demonstrated tobe either a false or trivial finding, devaluing the text. However, there are many other elementsthat also need further clarification. In some cases these are not assailable in terms of simplelogic, but rather my interpretations depend on certain assumptions.First, given that this is the \"Book of the Law\", and that \"the Law is for all\" [AL I, 34], any or atleast most of the references apparently focused on a particular historical person, e.g. Crowley,have to have also a more general interpretation. If this were not the case then the text would haveno claim to universality and thus be of little value to the rest of us.Another problematic element is that the text seems to contradict itself by saying both that \"Loveis the law\" in AL I, 57, and \"Beware lest any force another, King against King!\" in AL II, 24,and then saying to \"stamp down the wretched & the weak:\" [AL II, 21] and \"Trample down theHeathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat!\" [AL III, 11]. Either weare seeing a simple contradiction, in which case the text is massively confused, perhaps beyondthe possibility of interpretation, or these several statements are spoken on different levels, andthus are to be each interpreted differently. As many such statements occur in the third chapter,although not exclusively, one favored interpretation is that these are references to theiconography of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. If so, then these statements are no different in quality thansimilar ones in the Tibetan \"Bordo Thodrol\" or ‘Book of the Dead’ and should be interpretedaccordingly. This will be discussed in more detail in the section on the Cult of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.This may provide a way of interpreting some of the more ruthless statements that run through outthe text.All of these interpretations assume that there is an intelligible message in this text, that wishesitself to be disclosed. If not, it is simply a closed cypher and not worth our attention. Further, if ithas anything worthwhile to say to us it needs to be proadaptive, and not leading us intomaintaining the violence and abuse that dominates our culture and would lead to our downfall.Some have interpreted Liber AL as misanthropic and conducive to a dominator society. AdolfHitler and L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, are two examples of these knownhistorically. If this is the best Thelema can do there would be little point in this discussion.However, if these are digressions from the simple core message of the text that we must workwith each other, respecting our mutual sovereignty, there may be in Liber AL a new approach tolife that may indeed, as Nuit says, \"regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart &my tongue, unto whom I send this kiss.\"[AL I, 53]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Nu & Had, The Cosmology of Liber AL vel LegisUpon first examination of Liber AL vel Legis, the reader will note that it has three chapters, eachspoken in a different ‘voice’. Each chapter is, for the most part, ‘spoken’ by a persona referringto itself in the first person singular. The first chapter is principally the voice of Nuit, the second,Hadit, and the third, Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Each chapter serves to express the nature of the persona andits relationships with the other personas. The names are derived from Egyptian deities and mostof the symbolism of the text refers to concepts from the Egyptian cosmos, among several others.Together they embody the expressed and implied cosmology of Liber AL, what the structuralistswould call the surface and deep theological structures, respectively.Nuit and Hadit are complementary co-existents and as Ra-Hoor-Khuit is somewhat outside thissymmetry, we will return to ‘him’ later. In terms of the philosophy of organism, Hadit is apersonification of (an) Actual Entity while Nuit is the World of that Entity including ‘God’ inWhitehead’s sense. One verse that explicitly states their relationship says \"I, Hadit, am thecomplement of Nu [Nuit ], my bride... In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, thecircumference, is nowhere found.\"[AL II, 2-3] Their relationship is as Lovers and thus all theirinteractions are the creative act, which \"is the universe incarnating itself as one\". [PR 245] Thisis first seen in the opening line of the work, \"Had! The manifestation of Nuit.\"[AL I, 1] The‘center & circumference’ quote, according to Frances Yates, originates in the Gnostic HermeticCorpus, appropriately, as this is the tradition in which Liber AL emerges.Nuit functions in two ways like Whitehead’s God and the world. First she declares herself as theworld by stating that She is \"Infinite Space and the Infinite Stars thereof\"[AL I, 22], thus she isthe system taken as a whole. Everything in the system is represented symbolically in this dictionas a star in the body of Nuit; \"Every man and every woman is a star.\"[AL I, 3] Nuit is a variationon the Egyptian Nut, the Heaven goddess, who’s image is the night sky (‘nuit’ = ‘night’ inFrench). Here we are seeing the whole of existence expressed in terms of the experiencedvastness of deep space. Later, when we see the phrase, \"and the kisses of the stars rain hard uponthy body,\"[AL II, 62] we are seeing the ingression of the datum of other entities into theconcrescent process of a particular human entity as modeled in the text’s scribe.Nuit is also the locus, in this expression, of the potentiality of the universe. Her gift is the\"consciousness of the continuity of existence\" [AL I, 26] and her presencing is through the \"non-atomic fact of [her] universality\" [AL I, 26 (manuscript)]. She is thus the extensive continuum inwhich all entities arise as a complex \"united by the various allied relationships of whole topart,... of overlapping,... and contact,... [&c.]\"[PR 66] This continuum has no boundary due toits non-entitative nature, her ‘non-atomic’ness, and is thus the \"circumference... nowherefound\"[AL II, 3].Nuit is also the ‘Not’, the nonexistent, in her continuity, \"the omnipresence of [her] body\". \"ONuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but asNone; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!\" In this sense Nuit is boththe Receptacle, the formless form in which all arises, and thus ‘inappropriate’ to speak aboutsince no qualification about it can be made, as well as the abode of objective immortality. \"Igive... upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy\" [AL I, 58] As Whitehead puts it, the \"not-being of occasions is their objective immortality\"[AI 237] In perishing the immediate occasion"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"enters into immortality in the body of Nuit becoming one with the company of the stars. Thestars here are the determinant influences upon all future becoming. Interestingly, this is areframing of the classical (Stoic) notions of astrology in which the stars rule the fates of allliving things.In the sense that \"I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see yourjoy\"[AL I,13], Nuit is also Whitehead’s ‘God the co-sufferer’. Similarly all acts of love are ‘toher’ since it is her lure that guides the concrescent process along. [cf. AL I, 53, 62, 63, 65 & III,62]Hadit on the other hand, as the center that is everywhere, reflects Whitehead’s scheme in whichthe \"real potentialities relative to all standpoints are coordinated as diverse determinations of oneextensive continuum\"[PR 66]. The relationship between Had and Nu is that of the contrarypotentialities in mere continuum: \"in the actual world there are definite atomic actualitiesdetermining one coherent system of real divisions throughout the region of actuality. Everyactuality in its relationship to other actual entities is in this sense somewhere in the continuum,and arise out of the data provided by this standpoint. But in an other sense it is everywherethroughout the continuum; for its constitution includes the objectifications of the actual worldand thereby includes the continuum; also the potential objectification of itself contribute to thereal potentialities whose solidarity the continuum expresses. Thus the continuum is present ineach actual entity, and each actual entity pervades the continuum.\"[PR 67] \"In the sphere [i.e. theextensive contiuum] I [Hadit] am everywhere the centre as she [Nuit], the circumference, isnowhere found.\" [AL II, 3]Hadit is the individual concrescence produces and the process. This is clearly present in AL II, 7:\"I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle.‘Come unto me’ is a foolish word: for it is I that go.\" The Magickian calls into immediatepresence and the Exorcist banishes into irrelevancy all influences upon the entity. This is clearlya description of the supplementary phases of concrescence. [PR p. 213-4] The images of thewheel and circle support this poetically and have some technical magickal application. They arespeaking to the ‘core’ quality that Hadit presents in every entity reprising AL II, 6: \"I am theflame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.\" We are also told that toinvoke Hadit is of little effect, \"a foolish word\" since Hadit is the going process. In AL II 8 thisexpanded to indicate that even worship is thus impossible since Hadit is the worshiper: \"Whoworshipped Heru-pa-kraath[3] have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper.\"To know Hadit is a impossibility according to this text. Hadit says, \"Yet she shall be known & Inever.\" [AL II,4] This is pointing to the sense in which the actual entity does not know itselfsince that would require it to be objectified in itself which would mean that it would havealready have had to perished, closed up and become an object capable of being objectified. Wewill see this again later in that the satisfaction of an entity can not be conscious to the entityduring its process.[PR 85] But an actual entity is the living process of its becoming and itsresultant. We can only know it by the genetic analysis of its becoming and its effect upon us,which is how we objectify it in our own constitution. Since Hadit presents the process and itsresultant it justifiably claims to be \"I am Life, and the giver of Life...\" but since to know Haditrequires that the entity in question has perished the knowledge of that being is the knowledge ofa dead thing, \"...therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.\"[AL II, 6] There is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"also another way in which Hadit can not be known. Since during the process of concrescencethat becoming entity is out of touch with all contemporary entities \"during\" its concrescence it isalso at that time unknown. This is one explanation of Hadit’s self-identification as being Not ornone in Chapter II, verses 15 and 66.Yet in verses II, 12-13 we see an interesting differentiation between Hadit and \"the knower\".This has shades of a doctrine of a true nature of the self and a supposed self, here ‘the knower’,verses Hadit. If we recall that Hadit is present throughout the extensive continuum that is thesphere (read Nuit), and then compare that with our usual awareness of not being everywhere atonce we can then make an practical distinction between these two natures of the self. In sum, weignore so much of our world that we hardly realize how much there is to attend to. The aspectthat does so in all of us is here presented as Hadit and the aspect that ignores such data is herepresented as the scribe, ‘the knower’ {cf. \"Thou knowest!\" AL I, 26 as a reference to thescribe}.[4]In summary what we have in the Nuit and Hadit chapters are expressions about the nature of thewhole of things from the point of view of a world in which there are embedded individuals andfrom the point of view of the individual embedded in a world. Since these ‘two’ dwell in deeprelationality we must also explain how they relate. Nuit gives us the principle mode both throughher law and through direct command: Love is her law [AL I 57]. It is to the fulfillment of thatlaw that she invites us all to \"Come forth, o children under the stars, & take your fill of love!\"[AL I 12]. She again uses the phrase ‘fill of love’ in verse 51 saying, \"...take your fill and will oflove as ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will! But always unto me.\" Leaving aside theawesome issue of the sexual more expressed here, we see by the concluding sentence that theseactivities have a particular focus, upon Nuit. What benefit would having dedicated acts of love toNuit give the individual? Chapter I, verse 32 charges us to \"Obey my prophet! follow out theordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain.This is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give,by all I desire of ye all.\" Should we seek Nuit only we will be redeemed from all pain, shepromises, by the circumference, the vault of her body, and by the center, her heart and tongueand by her relationship with us which is one of desire, and later we will see, love. HereWhitehead’s notion of God the co-sufferer comes out clearly except here it is taken even moreemphatically and positively. Nuit not only suffers with us, and in so doing redeems us from pain,but also co-enjoys with us.[cf. AL I, 13] It is in this relationship that the soteriology of Thelemacomes forth. For its is in division and difference that pain and hurt emerge: \"Let there be nodifference made among you between any one thing & any other thing; for thereby there comethhurt.\" [AL I, 22] And again, \"This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is asnothing, and the joy of dissolution all.\"[AL I, 30]In response Nuit claims that, \"There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is acurse.\"[AL I, 41] This makes her claim that the Law is love more clear. It is through love that thepain and hurt are remedied and the Law made whole. But beyond this more general claim shealso adds that \"But to love me is better than all things:\"[AL I, 61] From this verse to the end ofthe chapter we see a focus on what can be best termed the Cult of Nuit. We are asked again, aswe were in verse 51, to make all actions \"Unto Her\". To understand this first off we need to seethat we are being told that the process ‘to love her’ is better than any substance; ‘all things’. This"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"accords with the nature of cultic activities since they need to be doings to engage us. We knowfurther from her promise that to enjoy the love of her redeems us from all pain. Who then is Nuitthat this generic dedication of love would apply and could work in this way? She, beingeverything but the individual percipient entity, is the Other, that which we are not yet, but incoming into contact with it we are about to become, that is, we are about to include in ourconstitution. She is thus the region of all potential. She is also referred to in the first verse of thesecond chapter as Nu, the hiding of Hadit. Nu is the phonetic representation of the Egyptian‘nu’-pot, a small round vessel which, inverted, is likened to the bowl of the sky, Nut or Nuit.This invokes our previous discussion of Nuit as the Platonic Receptacle. However, Nu also punssimply to ‘new’, all that we are not, yet. ‘Nuit’, the region of all potential, the ‘Nu’, thereceptacle out of which all forms emerge, and the ‘New’ together function as what Whiteheaddescribes as the ‘lure to novelty’. By calling us to her, Nuit is inviting us to expand our naturesinto the openness of possibility escaping beyond the limitations of division through entering intoa love-relationship with all we are not. We are invited to make our world and everything in it ourlover, dissolving all pain into the joy of union [cf. AL I, 30] To this end Nuit’s original epiphanyin AL I, 26 is with \"her lithe body arched for love.\" She wishes to be our lover in all that we do.Word, Law and Will in Liber AL vel LegisAs Thelema, or ‘Will’, is a central motif of our work it remains a principle in need of deepelucidation. We find it for the first time in our text in the phrase, \"The word of the Law isQelhma\" [AL I, 39]. This phrase brings together several key notions from the ancient andclassical worlds; ‘word’, ‘law’ and ‘will’. We have a very useful and powerful resource providedby Christian scholars for understanding these words in the Theological Dictionary of the NewTestament. By drawing upon this resource we can recreate the context in which these words areembedded and thus be able to better understand their meaning in our text. One key element hereis the question of whether Crowley is a participant in the tradition in which these terms emerge.Besides the fact that he was raised in a family belong to the proto-fundamentalist sect called thePlymouth Brethren and educated in the classical manner at Trinity College, Cambridge, a briefscan of the bibliography he provides for training in his system of thought and the texts referredto in his writings show that he is seated firmly in this tradition. Our subsequent exploration willbring this out even further.As we saw before in our word analysis of ‘Law’,[5] logos can mean simply a way of letting athing lie before one. For the Greeks this notion of logos was ‘almost symbolic of the Greekunderstanding of the world and existence.’ [TD v. ?[6] p. 77] Their understanding of this notiontransformed from simple accounting to mathematical proportion to reason and eventually to thegreater notion of mind. It was through the agency of logos that the Stoics saw human’s ability torecognize the intelligible law imbedded in all things and thus the cosmic order.[TD v. ? p.81]They saw that in the individual dwelt a particular logos that was part of the great general logosthat when lived out combined into a great cosmos.[TD v. ? p.85] To attain to awareness of thislogos and to live by it was the ethical task of the Greek. The Mysteries and Classical Hermetictraditions carried this further with emphasis on the revelation of the logos to be followed.Whereas in the Greek tradition ‘logos’ is the connected rational element in speech, its data, in theOld Testament the logos is principally the uttered command of Yahweh, both in the sense of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"creation and cultic demand. Its similarity to the Greek is to be noted in that this uttered word stillprovides the determinant order that creates the world but it does not possess the rationalconstraint of the Greek notion by its being a revelation. In Johanine Christianity, where thenotion of logos takes on its most forceful appearance, it emerges in the life, words, acts andsimple facticity of the Christ. Christ is the Word and his actions are embodiments of the Word.But it is in Christ’s uniqueness as the only Word that contrast emerges with the general Greekconception. Here Christ remains as a model and manifestation to which all may aspire but nonemay attain. Let us stop here and go back to explore ‘Law’ because we will find that they bothend in the same place, with the uniqueness of Christ.Nomos, Law, goes through several distinct stages in Greek usage. It begins as the norms ofsociety which are seen as manifestations of cosmic order. When the Greek world contacts othercultures it begins to have its laws and mores challenged by the plurality of law that they contact.Nonetheless for Socrates law was the commonly available objective knowledge of right andwrong and, not being able to separate his conscience from the degenerate political morality, hefelt compelled to drink the hemlock. Plato responded to this misuse of law by demanding moreintelligence for it. Since law could not change to meet new circumstances fast enough, he wanteda king who’s word was law and who was able through the possession of ‘true knowledge’ able toguide the state. In this sense this individual would then be outside of the law and a law untothemselves, yet through being so thoroughly righteous was the ideal ruler. This lawful lifewithout laws became the aspiration of Greek culture and an source for individual piety. Throughcontemplating the law of the cosmos the philosopher becomes a manifestation of the law in his[sic] actions. This law becomes a strong interiorized drive in the lives of its individual adherentsand was further developed in Neo-Platonism and Orphic Platonism. The law here becomes thatprinciple \"wherein a being, or something of intrinsic validity, is discovered and apprehended... Itis the ancient, valid and effective order which does not merely issue orders but creates order,which does not merely command, require or prohibit but rules, which evokes as it were its ownfulfillment, and which upholds itself, or is upheld, in the face of non-fulfillment.\"[TD v. ? p.1035]The Judeo-Christian pattern is very similar. For the Jew the Law of the Covenant was theconstitutional proclamation of the order of the People of Yahweh. It determined membership andbehavior. As such it was the cultural norm and, as the word of Yahweh is seen as creative, itconstitutes in some manner Cosmic order itself. Yet this followed a pattern of interiorizationsimilar to the Greek’s in the person of Jesus. Jesus, in his instance that the attitude with which anaction is performed matters more than the form turns the law inside out. But there is an evenmore fundamental change in Jesus’s innovation, the law is removed from its place as mediatorbetween Yahweh and his people and Jesus takes its place. This is essentially the same as thereplacing of the nomos of the Greeks with the divine King. This gives the law a more interactivequality only possible when it is intelligent. However, the principle difference is that here, againthis embodiment of law is only available in the person of Christ Jesus. We have again arrived inthe same place and so let us stop here and examine ‘Thelema’ or Will in terms of this tradition.In Hellenistic times ‘thelema’ referred to the purpose of persons and some times simply to theimpulse of desire. In the Synagogues it became a term referring to the Divine Will. For theHermetics it was equated with God especially in the sense of perfect, unlimited creative andregenerative power. However, by the New Testament, thelema is \"the ultimate basis, the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"supreme norm, the only source of the whole work of salvation. It is its final, pre-temporalfoundation.\"[TD v. ? p.57] The task of the adherent is to be ready for a renewal of their nuos for\"[o]nly the renewed nuos knows the will of god in order thereby to set up its goal and to fashionits service. The request to be filled with the knowledge of His will... is also concerned with agnosis relating to the practical goal of life... The doing of the will [is] the basic condition of anessential goal.\"[TD v. ? p. 58] Yet this notion of will, exemplified by Jesus is characterized bythe submission of the will of the individual to the divine will implying that these are inherentlyalienated. This contrast is further emphasized in that the Cosmos is said to not do the will of Godand so a Christian must.[TD v. ? p. 58] Here is where our three words come together at this sameend point.The Thelemic paradigm can be seen as an answer to the dead end presented by Jesus Christ’srole as sole Word and Law, and who’s example in the way of will is through submission. Theproblem is that if Jesus is the only Word and Law, neither of these are accessible to the rest of usand we are dependent on a preserved text and revelation. Worse still, this revelation is 2000years old and massively out of date. For example, I live with nuclear bombs, not sheep. Further,in an age of wide spread oppression, submission to any power is suspect. Who can know theneeds of an individual better than that individual? These are the challenges Thelema addresses.But before we can truly interpret Liber AL’s message we need to examine the phrase we beganwith: \"The word of the Law is Qelhma.\"On the basis of the Greek tradition out of which this term emerges we can now transform thisphrase into the response it is to the Christian tradition. ‘Word’ is the process where by order isintelligible and recognizable. ‘Law’ is the normative principle inherent in the world as its order,superior to and more fundamental than any given expression of that order, thus it is not able tobe reduced to formula. From this reasoning we derive: \"The Intelligence of Ordering is Will.\"Having situated ‘Thelema’ in the tradition out of which it emerges we need to probe into itsontological function. To do this we may turn to our normative metaphysics, the philosophy oforganism. What I hope to show is, in accord with my basic thesis, that the thelemic notion of‘will’ is able to be interpreted by Whitehead’s philosophy and in Whitehead’s terms wouldcalled the ‘subjective aim’.One of the key characteristics of an individual will is that it is coordinated with all otherindividual wills. This has to do with the reflexivity of the system as a whole expressed in LiberAL as the complementarity of Nu and Had. [AL II, 2]. Very little is said about this although it isessential in most interpretations of Thelema (cf. Crowley’s commentaries, the prologues to thevarious editions of Liber AL, &c.). This is often seen as manifestation of the divine will, i.e.Hadit’s will,[7] in each individual person or ‘star’. The philosophy of organism provides anexcellent way of accounting for this. This individual subjective aim is derived from the divinesubjective aim. This is in part due to the continual effect the primordial nature of God has uponall subsequent concrescences by providing the ground of order upon which all functioningdepends [PR 108, 283]. But also, in a more particular manner, the divine aim is relevant to theparticular world in which that entity becomes [PR 224-225], and presents the best aim for thatparticular impasse [PR 244]. Thus the incursion of divine aim is not simply a generic providencebut a specific one related to the needs and reality of the particular concrescent entity. By beingthe lure or guide towards the best that could be achieved in each moment there is implied in the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"divine aim impressed upon the initial phases of an entity’s concrescence a coordination with allother wills in that they are similarly derived from the one universal will. This might well becalled the whole-ing of the law which nature is love and which is actualized through doing one’swill (cf. word analysis of ‘law’).Another factor in the nature of will as presented in the philosophy of organism is the importanceof subjective aim in the genetic constitution of an entity. This raises the subjective aim to thesame high level of ontological importance as will is presented in Thelema. The subjective aimdetermines the ordering, integration and relationships between all of the ingressing eternalobjects, the subjective forms and the prehensions. As these constitute an actual entity theimportance of subjective aim or will is thus obvious. In Liber AL we see this raised to the statusof ultimate law. When we read that \"There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt\" [AL III, 60], weare being told that the subjective aim of the individual entity, which is derived of God, is theultimate arbiter of purpose and being. Obviously, Whitehead would agree.Having looked at the system’s relationship to the individual and the individual’s geneticrelationship with the system we can see there is a clear correspondence between ‘subjective aim’as presented in the philosophy of organism and ‘will’ in Liber AL. What Liber AL also purportsto do is give advice about how ‘will’ works and on the right relationship between the individualand their will. We will find that this advice corresponds nicely with Whitehead’s assessment ofthe nature of the subjective aim and concrescence.The strongest advice given in Liber AL is given in the first chapter in verses 42-45. : \"So withthy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will. / Do that, and no other shall say nay. / For pure will,unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect. / The Perfect andthe Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!\" This is one of the very few verses thatuse the word ‘will’ (other than in the sense of ‘shall’) that we have not discussed already. Itconstitutes the single most useful piece of advice about how to function in the world that our textpresents. Thus, its analysis in terms of the philosophy of organism is important.\"So with thy all;\" Since all that we ‘have’ are the ingressing eternal objects, the subjective formsand the prehensions included in our concrescences, it is with them that we are being directed bythis phrase to concern ourselves. \"... thou hast no right but to do thy will,\" tells us that there isno other way of dealing with these concerns except through the organizing principle of oursubjective aim or will. \"Do that, and no other shall say nay,\" speaks to the conditioned autonomyof that subjective aim in the process of its integrations. Once an entity has begun itsconcrescence it is out of touch with all other entities until it completes its process and during thatprocess it freely determines the nature of its process and thus itself in accord with its subjectiveaim.The wherefore of this process comes in the next sentence: \"For pure will, unassuaged of purpose,delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.\" To be ‘unassuaged of purpose’ is to bewithout any distractions from the goal. Whitehead handles this with his notion of ‘balance’which means that \"no realized eternal object shall eliminate potential contrasts between otherrealized eternal objects.\" This would \"attenuate the intensities of feeling derivable from theingressions of the various elements\" in the constitution of the concrescent entity. [PR 278] Thisis sub-optimal since the generic aim is towards the intensity of experience."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"To be ‘delivered from the lust of result’ is to be acting without attachment to the result of one’sactions (cf. the Bhagavad Gita). The down fall in this is that, as Whitehead puts it \"[n]o actualentity can be conscious of its own satisfaction; for such knowledge would be a component in theprocess, and would thereby alter the satisfaction.\" [PR 85] In other words, if one knew whereone was going one would never get there. What Thelema adds to this understanding is how tohandle the fact that there is always some vision of the goal, a lure towards an aim. This, whethera simple contrast or complex proposition must not be lusted after, just simply worked for withoutdistraction, even the distraction of the goal. The deliverance from distraction is the adviceThelema presents so as to attain to the ‘perfect’ satisfaction in every concrescence, in ‘everyway’.As for \"The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!\" see PR p. 85 forsatisfaction as the means through which an entity becomes an \"immortal part-creator of thetranscendent world\". The transcendent world is the determinant influence of all entities that havebecome and perished, passing into objective immortality, their not-being.[AI 237] Being real butnot longer actual, in terms of the symbol set found in Liber AL this transcendent world is termedthe ‘not’ or here ‘none’. It is also ‘one world’ or ‘one Perfect’ in that it is through a wholeness orunity that the past comes to bear on the concrescent present, and no part or duality. Theperfectness of this entire description comes with the complete accommodation that the divinemakes for the actual entity as it passes into objective immortality, completing the creative cycle,fulfilling the divine aim.PostscriptHaving come to the end of the immediate time and energy to be put in to the project of analyzingand exegeting Liber AL vel Legis, it is clear that there are vast regions of research opened bythis initial exploration waiting and available for study. These will have to addressed in the future.What this study has shown is that the classical exegetical method does apply to our text, bringingout deeper insights as to its meaning and its relevance to and place in mainstream theologicaldiscourse. It also shows that the philosophy of organism can be a workable world view throughwhich Liber AL may be interpreted. This preliminary study speaks strongly to the need to breakthe silence surrounding discussion and interpretation of Liber AL vel Legis so that its value maybecome more available to all.This said, it is worth while to briefly list some of the further problems facing the exegete andsome of the at present visible avenues of research to be done.Word-study: The following words need to be studied in light of their place in our text and in thewestern tradition: ‘not at all’, king (and allied notions of sovereignty), slave, service, star,warrior, children, heart and tongue, because, fool(s), light and night, ordeal and initiation, dog,&c.Issues: the place of women (partly dealt with by the writing conventions of the era and \"Everyman and every woman is a star\" [AL I, 3] which proclaims their fundamental equality with men,but must be contrasted with AL I, 61, and other places where they appear as property). Are themore wrathful expressions of Ra-Hoor-Khuit (and others) simply iconography able to beinterpreted in a similar manner to the Tibetan Wrathful Buddhas? Ra-Hoor-Khuit needs to be"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"explicated in general. Who are the Beast, and his Bride, the Scarlet Woman. What of the titlesScribe,Prophet, Priest, and Prince? How exactly does Thelema and Liber AL present theEgyptian tradition. What relationships are there between Liber AL vel Legis and the otherThelemic Holy Books that Crowley wrote, and beyond that to the continually emerging otherHoly Books scribed by people other than Crowley? What relationship is there between Thelemaand Buddhism, specifically Mahayana and Vajrayana, and further to Dzogchen? Is Liber AL awestern tantra or a ‘terma’, a mind treasure? What of the topography of the Cult of Thelema canbe mapped out? How much of Liber AL can and should be interpreted in the light of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (\"Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs.Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in that East at the Equinox of the Gods;\" [AL I, 49] is aparaphrase of the Golden Dawn Equinox ceremony. Is this relevant and if so, how?). What is theplace of Qabalah in Thelema? How trustable are Crowley’s commentaries? What is the place ofYoga in Thelema? How is reason to be used (cf. \"Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite& unknown; & all of their words are skew-wise.\" [AL II, 32])? What relationship does Liber ALhave with the Chaldean Oracles? What is Thelema’s political program? How much moreconnection is there between Thelema and Whitehead’s philosophy of organism. What ofThelema can be used to explicate the philosophy of organism. &c.This list is just a preliminary set of questions with which to spark much further research. It is byno means exhaustive. What we have here is the beginning of the task.Bibliography[BE] Beyer, Stephan. The Buddhist Experience: Sources and Interpretations, Encino, CA:Dickenson Publishing Co.
