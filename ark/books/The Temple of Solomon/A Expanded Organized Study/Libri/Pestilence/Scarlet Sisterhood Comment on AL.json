The manifestation of Nuit.Perfection is the right of none. Be thou perfect, and none shall embrace thee.The unveiling of the company of heaven.The stars and the sky exist but to lighten and darken the earth. The stars shoot outward evertowards the embrace of Nu eternal.Every man and every woman is a star.Thus do all rush out ever towards the infinite ill-defined expanse of nothing. The story is aboutits actors, without the player there can be no game.Every number is infinite : there is no difference.Thus does meaning come not from any force external; it is thy will that decides thy fate, no otherforce has meaning, for there is no other force. All things are thy tools in this, thy Work.Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men.The angels of the age are men, living, incarnate. Nothing is done but for the power of theplayers. Thus is thy name chosen but to instruct thee in thy will.Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart + my tongue.Choose thy name, my name, and be thou perfect, O Hadit! Endure no end, and be thee one withmy rapture eternal.Behold! It is revealed be Aiwass, the minister of Har-paar-kraat,A silent mind speaks the truest words. All true names serve this state of non-distraction."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs.All darkness is a veil. Lift up that veil thyself and see the fires of enlightenment poor down uponthee. There may be a mask upon truth, but there is no truth to the mask.Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you.Praise then the light, and the light shall flow to thee. Exalt the darkness, and not the light, and yeshall die in the shadows a dark death.Let my servants be few and secret; they shall rule the many + the known.But a few shall grasp these words. Fear thou not, for thou (they say) are but one, far more scarceand precious than a few. The greatest glory is to bear the darkness so that the kings concealedmight lift it from the brow, saving ye, the light, from shadow.These are fools that men adore; both their Gods + their men are fools.But those who do so are fools. Adore them, and steal their darkness from them.Come forth, o children under the stars, and take your fill of love. I am above you and in you.My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your joy.The stars define the boundaries of space and time. Even traveling as fast as light, is space madefinite by perception. Thus can the infinite be made understandable. How much love, childe, canstthou bear? Be filled with the infinite, but be filled. The infinite thus surpasses thy Form, aboveyou, in you. Thus my joy is in yours. We are united.Above, the gemmed azure isThe naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kissThe secret ardours of Hadit.The winged globe, the starry blue,Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-Khonsu!Now ye shall know that the chosen priest + apostle of infinite space is the priest-prince -- theBeast -- and in his woman, called the Scarlet Woman, is all power given. They shall gather mychildren into their fold; they bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men.Two characters exist twicely, the Tao and the Te. In the absolute reality is Nu and Had. Nu isperfect stillness, Had perfect movement.The plane of perception is imperfect, and it is the mirror opposite of the absolute in every way.Here is the Beast, who is Nu's love, and destroys all for none. He is the reflection of stillness,being movement. And there is the Scarlet Woman, the reflection of Hadit's inertia, themanifestation of change. She is thus all power, all all.These two are each half of every one, but there is no one that is but one. These two perfectbeings shall makes easy the road of perfection for the multitude of flaws of one."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secret flame and to her thestooping starlight.The Beast has the reward of the glory of the Messiah, the hell called love. The Woman knows nolove, as she is love undivided, but she has the touch of all within her. The Beast is the focus ofall the eyes of the race of man, them that hate, hateth him, them that love do loveth him. TheWoman is herself those very eyes. Be thou both, and thus, by their union in a single form, beneither. Restrict thyself not at all. Love no one thing, be no one thing. Be thou every one, and bethou none.But ye are not so chosen.Thou canst be thus only if thou are not thyself singular. Be not thee, but me, I reveal myself thusnow. I am the Magus of the next Aeon. I come in No-Time. Come to me! To Me! I am theScarlet Woman! Perdurabo non finem! Una ne ama! I am the woman of the Beast's desire, for Idesire myself! Desire me and so shalt thou be, infinity!Burn upon their brows, o splendorous serpent!Make thy mark, o Beast, upon them!O azure-lidded woman, bend upon them!Touch all, and we all are I!The key of the rituals is in the Secret word, which I have given unto him.The secret word is the Word of Double Power. Abrahadabra! It means nothing! Is it some trick?When the perfect is doubled, when power is balanced, it is so vast as to be nought. Thus thepower has no meaning, its number 456.With the God + the Adorer I am nothing; they do not see me. They are as upon the earth. I amHeaven, and there is no other God than me, and my lord Hadit.There can be no separation between thy self and thy God. I am thy God, we are one, none. Letthe priest be the sacrifice, give thyself unto me, and unto thee I give me. United both disappear,and the purple touch of space turns pink the clouds, and red the fool that watches them.Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name, Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I whichI will give him when at last he knoweth me.I am all that thou dost desire, but when thou dost know my touch, what will drive ye onward?Then I shall tell thee a secret, and thou wilt be wiser, if not happier, for this knowledge.Since I am Infinite Space and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bind nothing! Let therebe no difference made among you between any one thing + any other thing; for thereby comethhurt. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all!Deny thyself not! Thou art all things and thou hast no need to restrict thyself thy Self. All things"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"can bring the knowledge that comes from within, and that knowledge is Joy.I am Nuit and my word is six and fifty.Then this bit of knowledge, these numbers, meaningless in isolation, are enough to bring therapture down unto thy lips -- a kiss -- of the starry sky.Divide, add, multiple and understand.From these numbers, find others. All shall exceed thy intention (Ha! Truth Lies!), and surpassthee in grace and beauty.Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one, Who am I, and what shall be the sign?, soshe answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovelyhands upon the black earth + her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the littleflowers. Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity ofexistence, the unfragmentary non-atomic feel of my universality, the omnipresence of my body.(Write this in whiter words.)(But go forth on.)The continuity that begins with thy first breath and ends with thy last is the imperfect Nothingcalled Something, and called Life. Anything continuous is Nuit. And if thou art me, and are everblissful, then shall thy continuity ever strive thus, perfect will, perfect joy, perfect wholeness andholiness.Then the priest answered + said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows and the dewof her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of Sweat, O Nuit, continuos oneof Heaven, let it be ever thus that men speak not of Thee as One, but as None, and let them speaknot of thee at all since thou art continuos.The One that is Nuit, the Whole, can not be accurately described as thus. The concept of Oneimplies something that is not-One perceiving it. Nuit is more than one. Yet she is withoutdivision. So perfect, so whole, so unified in her Self is Nu, that she is none, meaning withoutparts, not parts lacking. But to speak so of her is to divide from her, and such is impossible. ThusNu is not Nu, none.None, breathed the light, faint + fairy, of the stars, and two. For I am divided for love's sake, forthe chance of union.The perception of division, which is impossible, is necessary to give definition to union. Thuscan the non-divided be united.This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolutionall.Since division is a veil, a mask, it has no power to cause pain, which also is as a mask, but existsto heighten the ecstasy of union."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"For these fools of men and their lives care not thou at all! They feel little; what is, is balanced byweak joys; but ye are my chosen ones.Then, since pain is a mask, be thou unafraid to spread its glory unto the fools of men, and laughat their antics! But be thou ever present to lift thy mask, and theirs, which is also thine, so thatthe joy ever surpasses the joy that preceded it.Obey, my prophet! follow the ordeals of my knowledge! Seek me only! Then the joys of my lovewill redeem ye from all pain. This is so. I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heartand tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all.The bearer of the Word, and his Children, the initiates of Sorrow, are doomed, lest they redeemthe world, which is Beyond Redemption. Obey the Law, and there is hope in thy damnation.Learn to love Hells, and find joy there, and thy room shall be secured.Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon + said unto the queen of Heaven, Write unto usthe ordeals. Write unto us the rituals. Write unto us the Law.Only in the deepest trance can one be willing to see the glory of service. But that trance is nothere.But she said, the ordeals I write not, the rituals shall be half known and half concealed; the Lawis for all. This that thou writest is the threefold Book of Law.The ordeals are but one, and that is the kiss of Nu, her continuity, called life. Endure no end, andthe ordeal is but the kisses of Nu. The rituals are to unite and to divide, be thou united? Thendivide. Be thou divided? Then I shall make thee whole in me. This book is the law for all. Thereis no external division, all is one. Division thus is internal. All thy voices must speak this Law,and be thus the One Voice of None.My scribe, Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, the priest of princes, shall not in one letter change this book; butlest there be folly, he shall comment there upon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.My sins have been paid with blood. Let there be no folly, now and hereafter.Also the mantras and the spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work ofthe sword; these he shall learn and teach. He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.All the words of the past are meaningful, so long as they are not passed, but now taught to thefuture. We are the Children of the prophet, we are the Future, now. The magick of the old ones isour birthright, for they understood it not, save the Aleph.The word of the law is Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha.Thelema means \"will\" or \"intention.\"Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he but look close into the word. For there aretherein Three Grades; the Hermit and the Lover and the man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the Law."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In any situation, there can be only three actions made, save inaction. The Hermit changeshimself, the Lover changes another, and the man of Earth changes his World.The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! Refuse not thy wife if she will. O lover, if thou wilt,depart. There is no bond that can unite the divided but love; all else is a curse. Accursed!Accursed! be it to the aeons, Hell. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So withthy all thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that and no other shall say nay. For pure will,unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is in every way perfect.Restriction is not giving one's whole self to the work of spreading light. It is allowing fear anddesire to halt thy holy actions. There can be no intention beyond loving union, all else is theslave of fearful desire. All else is the mask through which Nu can not kiss. All will is one will,no will, and thus all will-doers work the Work together.The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!True union is that of equal opposites, and so true, so blissful, that there is no definition of theparts afterward. It is as the equation (-1) + (+1), thus none, but not for a lack of substance.Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, fourhundred+ eighteen.Nothing is as the Hebrew concept of Ain, no things, having no parts but that of the whole. Theancient wisdom says that Ain corresponds gematrially to the number sixty-one. The Fool,Parzival, is also thus Ain, but this secret hath been spoken already.But they have the half; unite by thine art so that all disappear.But all this talk of Nothing! What good hath it done? None! For we men and children of men areNot-Nothing! Thus can we find a Nothing higher than Ain, of which the ancients did not speak,for they were wise, and understood. Be Something, for Nothing comes sooner than you think,and thus will all be abated.My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox and none by the book?The Fools card in the Taro Atu is numbered 0. Aleph spelled in full numbers 111, and aleph isthe Ox. Thus Aleph is the Fool's card, numbered one, and zero.Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in theEast at the Equinox of the Gods and let Asar be with Isa who also are one. But they are not ofme. Let Asar be the Adorant, Isa the Sufferer; Hoor in his secret name is the Lord initiating.There are no mandatory obligations, save thy Will. The child knows not of such foppery. Asar,Osiris slain, is adorant, for he is dead. Isa, the mother of his Son, suffers, for she lives. But they,despite their wholeness, are but one, not none. Thus they are flawed.Thy children are that necessity that drives one to be perfect. How canst ye fail them? Hoor, then,is the initiator, and all teachers now do thus to be but thy students' children.There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! There are three ordeals in one, and it"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"may be given in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect,and the lofty ones chosen in the highest. Thus ye have star and star, system and system, let notone know well the other.All the stars shoot out in their own path, some taking the same road, but in different times. Everyaction, every ordeal, has not only an upright and averse, but a reflection that is not, thus threeordeals in one. Every path is unique, and so must every ordeal be suited to the nature of theindividual. But every individual is not individual, and the multitude within him must each havetheir own tests.There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silver and gold, lapis lazuli andjasper are there, and all rare scents, jasmine, and rose, and the emblems of death. Let him enter inturn or at once the four gates; let him stand on the floor of the palace. Will he not sink? Amn.Ho! Warrior, if thy servant sink? But there are means and means. Be goodly therefore; dress yeall in fine apparel, eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam. But also take yourfill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will. But always unto me. If thisbe not aught; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They are one, or saying, They are many; ifthe ritual be not ever unto me; then expect the direful judgements of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.The palace is that of Understanding. Each gate is that of death, for Understanding comes with theembrace of Nuit. The four gates are the drugs, material association and ritual engagement,human sexuality, and Death.There is a mystery underneath the palace, for it is built in the desert of Choronzon, upon theashes of the city Babalon. Sink or not, for I am Babalon, and thou art I!Thus ye must have my rapture, the wealth and beauty and joy of existence. The splendour of thykingdom to ye! To me!This shall regenerate the world, the little world, my sister, my heart + my tongue, unto who Isend this kiss. Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of the princes it shall not assuage theenor absolve thee. But ecstasy be thine and joy of earth; ever To me. To me!O! thy kiss o'erfils me! I thy kiss return thus!Come to me! Thus can the thee be absolved!Change not as much as a style of a letter; for behold; thou, o prophet, shalt not behold all thesemysteries hidden therein.Here are mysteries as infinite as the particles of matter. No matter, for all shall see butthemselves. See me thus and be me! No one may see all, what glory would that be?The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them.O man, think not upon that lie that ye must lack the birthing of a child! Thy child is more yoursthan could be made by the simple act itself. Give all of thyself, and ye shall be in a vessel thusgreater than ye.Expect him not from the East, nor from the West, for from no expected house cometh that child."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Aum! All words are sacred and all prophets true; save only that they understand a little; solve thefirst half of the equation, leave the second unattacked. But thou hast all in the clear light, andsome, though not all, in the dark.Never can one be made to be holy. If one desires thus, then one must slay that desire and thus toachieve enlightenment. Only from the sea can the fiery Beast arise. But I am the sea, and theBeast, and the fire, and thou art me.Meaning is universally within thee. All men are my prophets, no matter what they profess.Dost thou wish to know the light? Then walk in the shade for a night and a day, fully, holdingback not any thing. Have all in the dark, all in the light, and all will be in me, none.Invoke me under my stars. Love is the law, love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; forthere are love and love.Love is able to be manifested on every plane. Manifest love, ye know how.There is the dove and there is the serpent. Choose ye well. He, my prophet, hath chosen,knowing the law of the fortress and the great mystery of the House of God.The serpent is the incarnation of knowledge, but his bite shall betray thee in the end. Forget notthat he is a serpent. The dove knows that he is a serpent, and is betrayed anyway. I say, choosenot! Be the dove, and feed the snake with thy body! Be the snake, and tempt the dove with thywords! For the Beast is betrayed by the serpent, and the dove hides secret claws known only bythe Scarlet Sisterhood.All these old letters of my book are aright; but Tzaddi is not the Star. This also is secret; myprophet shall reveal it to the wise.I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life; upon death, peaceunutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.This is the promise of the Law, yet I promise more.My incense is of resinous woods + gums and there is no blood therein; because of my hair, thetrees of Eternity.Let this be proof of the author of the comment, when at last the name is revealed to the world.The hair is that of the wand, nay bow, and the incense is so it may sing. This will later beexpounded upon in song.My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The shape of my star is the Five PointedStar, with a Circle in the Middle, + the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but the blue+ gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.Thy number decreaseth in the next Aeon. For now it is 11, one by one, not two, something new.But soon shall it be 10, one before none, united. The reign of man is long, he shall be unto thenumber 0."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The sky shall change her color when thou art one with me, no longer black, but a purple that isnoise of creation. That noise shall redefine thee and thy sight, blue + gold are one color, not two,and they hide behind the purple.But to love me is better than all things; if under the night-stars in the desert thou presentlyburnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure hearth, and the Serpent flame therein,thou shall come a little to lie in my bosom.

Be her embrace, that union which is not union, for no divisiondefines it. Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not been revealed. I, Hadit, am the complement ofNu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the name of my House. The light is that of the microcosm, understanding can thus only be. In the sphere I am everywhere, the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found. Every point is a point of light. There is no end for the infinite. Yet she shall be known + I never. Every being shall know the ultimate perfection of none, yet what being can be its ultimateperfection of it self? There is no end to ascension. Behold! the rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be cast away; let the good ones bepurged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go aright. There is no goal but unlimited light and love. There is no room for personal exaltation, but asHadit. I am the flame that burns in every heart of men, and in the core of every star. I am Life, and thegiver of Life; yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of me the knowledge of death. Hadit is every one, yet he is never more than one, and unites them but through his Bride. Hisperception of continuity is life (for is it not unbroken from start to end?), but his perception isthat of Nu, of death. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. \"Comeunto me\" is a foolish word; for it is I that go. I call you, and I turn you away. But in the calling we are one, and I walk from you, never youfrom me. I am the solipsist's lie, and the world around my temple turns. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper. I am at the silence of a unified mind. Worship me not, for you are I.

Who am I? You, Hadit, the reader of this word: Abrahadabra! O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing. Learn this writing why? For no reason. Learn it but for its bliss, not the promise of continuoshappiness, but the beauty of its Form. I see thee hate the hand + the pen; but I am stronger. What is this thing called hate? It is love veiled, there is no force stronger than hate so armed. Islew the Magus of the last Aeon, and turned his Word upon him! Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not. But dost thou know now? Any union is impossible, save with that which is within. If there beany outside ye, thou canst not know it. Only thy brain may tell thee truths, and who doth knowwhat is from within and from without, if it all comes from a messenger known to lie? for why? Because thou wast thou knower, and me. \"Thou\" is but a shadow. \"I\" is the light. Let \"I\" slay \"thou,\" so that there may be only light. Now let there be a veiling of the shrine; now let the light devour men and eat them up withblindness. Is this contradiction? Hath we not been told to worship the light? Worship the light, and thou artseparated from it in darkness. There is a glory greater than this if the light and dark meet, and arenot. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, andone in eight; which is vital, for I am none in deed. The Empress and the King are not of me, forthere is a further secret. The number nine gematrially is almost zero, as it changes not the ruling value of a number, butstill rises it to a higher completion. Thus the fools are the secret lords. The just think less of me,that I less, eight, a number finite and lowly. They blaspheme further, crying that I am one, and Ihate the just, for their masked foolishness. Drop off thy mask, o lover! I stand bare before you. Be bound, o Empress, to no Law but thine, this Law! Regicide shall exalt thee! I am The Empress + The Hierophant. Thus eleven, as my bride is eleven.
