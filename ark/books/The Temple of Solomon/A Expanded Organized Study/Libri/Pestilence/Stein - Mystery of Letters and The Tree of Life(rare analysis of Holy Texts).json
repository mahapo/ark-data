One begins with nothing, and ends with Nothing. In between, is illusion-a glimmer of what is truth. After chasing around the world for several years looking for answers to the four questions of initiation, I found answers within a few miles of where I was born, and even within myself. The four questions are: Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going? What am I looking for? The answer to each of these questions is clear: \"I don't know.\" If I knew the answers, I probably would not have chased around the world. I was born in the 27th year of the lEon of the Child, in the year of the Emperor. I graduated from high school the month after Crowley died. As a scientist, I found Thelema many years later. I publish this in the year of the Sun (IVxix A. L.). The lEon and the Universe lie ahead. At Khephra Camp of the O.T.O. in Brooklyn NY in the early 1980's, I formally recognized Thelema. After doing my first ritual in Camp, I came out thinking to myself \"What is all this rubbish?\" (I had interpreted the ritual quite literally, rather than symbolically.) Somehow, though, I stuck with the system, and found some answers for myself. Many answers came from exploration and a growing appreciation of the symbolic way to trans­mit truth-call it initiation. Some certainly came from exploring logic that adds meaning to the symbolism, and some from my initiators-call it aspi­ration. Now, some 30 years later, I find myself regularly doing an adaptation of Crowley's Ritual Beth-2. This is an invocation to knowledge, to Ra-Hoor­Khuit, and to Tahuti (=Mercury, Minerva, Athena, the \"wise owl\"). They symbolize ways of attaining knowledge, understanding and wisdom. The ix"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"X THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Beth-2 ritual ends with an invocation to Khephra who symbolizes the original light in darkness in the North. This relates to Hoor-Paar-Kraat. In the east, Ra-Hoor-Khuit (in his secret name and splendour) is the Lord initiating, the bringer of light into the current reon. United, Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-Paar-Kraat are Heru-Ra-Ha, Horus the Child-hence the name for the £on. Khephra symbolizes the darkness, the chaos that precedes God saying in Genesis I: 3, \"Let there be light.\" (The beetle rolls a ball of dung from which hatch larvae, symbolizing light.) That light first appears in the east, at dawn. The Greek word Helios (17A.zor;;) symbolizes it. So does Ra-Hoor-Khuit. So, I return to the origin in Khephra. It must be that what I search for is always in and around myself, though I may not perceive it.

They have provided guidance, knowl­edge and support. I have added historical data with information from the Golden Dawn, the O.T.o. and A.'. A.'. curricula. Above them all, I put par­ticular emphasis on the Class A material ofThelema. I have tried to follow, without change, the directives concerning the original texts. I include the rationale behind my views. I am solely responsible for the conclusions. To those named below I express my particular thanks and appreciation. They may not agree with my interpretations, or vice versa, but I acknowl­edge their contributions. I anticipate further discussion. In alphabetical order, they include: To my initiators: William Breeze, James Eschelman, Kent Finne, Richard Gernon, Dan Gunther, Michael Kramer, David and Lynn Scriven, Phyllis Seckler and James Wasserman. In recent times, I have had contributions and discussions with a wide range of colleagues who have challenged my ideas and presentation: Particularly I acknowledge my long-term friend, Norman Fleck, who more than 25 years has been a loyal critic and one striving for clarity in my presentation. To Pyramid Lodge, o.T.O., for many discussions and patience in analyz­ing Thelemic literature and symbolism, including particularly: Keith Bergeron, Rob and Sabrina Caine, Michael Kolson, August La Scola. To those outside that Lodge: Krzysztof Azarewicz, Justin Bunn, Richard Kaczynski, Bj0rn L0ken, Cassie Tsiris, and many others.

She demonstrates how the principles of Thelema operate beyond any \"official\" organization."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PREFACE THELEMA is a system of magick and mysticism identified with the £on of the Child, Heru-Ra-Ha. Its initial message was revealed and received in 1904 in the manuscript Liber L� The Book of the Law. Like most books of the sort, the message is encrypted in symbols-symbols with historical mean­ing, but subject to interpretation. With the New £on, these symbols often take on new meaning. Liber L is the ultimate unchangeable authority for Thelema. Additional books (\"Libers\"), especially those considered \"Class A,\" carry high, but sub­ordinate authority, and are not subject to change. Material of lesser import does not have that characteristic. However, they do have a consistent set of symbols. The present study attempts to show the inter-relationship among sym­bols in Class A libers, and how these symbols may be interpreted. The Tree of Life is a basis for correlating and comparing symbols from different sys­tems. As should be expected, in the new £on of the Child a change in per­spective changes some old ideas. As it says in Liber XXXI II: 5: Behold! The rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be cast away; let the good ones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this knowledge go aright. Liber XXVII, Trigrammaton presents a different viewpoint about the Cube of Space model and the three-dimensional Quantum Tree of Life model. It particularly describes the sephiroth in each. Liber XXXI, The Book of the Law, includes the Mystery of the Letters. The letters relate to the paths on the Tree of Life, including the Quantum Tree. They index clues to many of the correspondences among magickal and mystical systems. The unraveling of the Mystery is key to understanding the message of the £on. The transmission of the Word is stressed in Liber XXXI. It is easy to distort. The directions for spreading that Word are explicit. The underlying warning here is: Study the manuscript. It is the charter of individual and universal freedom. xiii"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiv THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Liber CCXXXI, The Atus of Ta huti� further explains the message of the paths. It is limited to the 22 Tarot trumps, and considers several aspects as a path of initiation. The correlation of these may provide a better understanding of words, symbols, and rituals. The goal is to encourage Thelema, a new and distinc­tive view of the relationship between a man and his universe. A man comes into this world knowing nothing about everything. He leaves it knowing everything about nothing. In between, all he can hope for is a glimmer of the reality behind the illusion and the symbols.

Crowley first called it Liber L. Later versions and interpretations have been given different names, such as LiberAL and The Book of the Law. In the present study, the title Liber L refers specifically to the manuscript in its original condition. The scribe was Aleister Crowley. He believed the warrior lord of Thebes was Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, identified previously from the Stele of Revealing, and one of his earlier incarnations. An entity named Aiwass delivered the message orally. Crowley described how he heard the text from over his left shoulder. Aiwass was the spokes­man, the Voice from the Silence, the ambassador or minister of Hoor-paar­kraat. HPK was his authority. By analogy, it follows the Bible tradition, \"And God said:\" during the days of Creation.

The manuscript, Liber L, had been misplaced in the UK some time in 1904 or 1905. It was relocated in September 1909 at Boleskine. The original typescript contained many obvious misinterpretations of the manuscript and needed revision. In the present study, Liber L refers to both the manuscript and the pub­lication of the text in 8CA1'/Jl.a which predated the rediscovery of the manu­script in 1909. The first publication of a facsimile of the manuscript itself occurred in 1912 in Equinox I (7) as a fo ldout after page 386. The Old Commentary fo llowed. This is the first edition published fo llowing the internal directions. Regarding the writing of Liber L, Crowley later wrote that it was not \"automatic writing.\" He heard dearly and distinctly the human articulate accents of a man: To this writing we now tum. It must have been on the 7th of April that W. commanded P. (now somewhat cowed) to enter the \"temple\" exadly u 12 o'clock noon on three successive days, and to write down wbat he should hear, rising exactly ;ot 1 o'clock. This he did. Immediately on his taking his seat the Voice began its Utterance, and ended exactly at the expiration nf the hour. These are the three chapters of Liber Legis, and we have nothing to add to the comment prepared by Fra. P. himself while the Sun was in the sign of the Virgin, Anno V from this first revelation.

He heard the message. From Noon to lPM each day, he received a chapter of Liber Legis. The Book of the Law is complete in three chapters. The statement about the verses is questionable. The manuscript does not indicate verses in Chapter One. The three chapters occur on 65 pages of manuscript. Class A publications are not to be altered so much as the style of a letter. The definition of the Classes of publications is discussed below. If extant, this suggests that any original manuscript supersedes its typescript interpre­tation. In the case of Liber L, fo r example, there are several variations of S, T, and 4 not expressed in any typeset version. Non-alphabetic or non­numeral characters present particular difficulties.

(Its importance was recognized later when it allowed the re-discovered manuscript to be identified with certainty.) The miniature size discourages anyone but a very determined reader.

Liber XXXI specifically says one \"cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the key of it all (III: 4 7) .\"Therefore, study cannot be forbidden, or the statement cannot be fulfilled. The Comment directly violates the text of Liber XXXI to which it is a comment. The sentences, instead, suggest four powers of the Sphinx in a particular way. 1) The study of this book is fo rbidden denies knowledge. 2) Whoever disregards this does so at his own risk denies the expres­sion of will. 3) Discuss ... shunned by all as centres of pestilence limits action (dar­ing). But yeast in a loaf of bread dough is a \"center of pestilence\" -pos­itive in effect. 4) Questions of Law decided only by appeal to my writings is silence. \"Orthodox\" or \"official\" interpretations are not to be pronounced. Let the words speak for themselves. Note the invitation in Liber XXXI II: 2. How does this help spread the principles ofThelema? The last sentence is the key. It stresses the right and responsibility of each individual to deter­mine its validity for himself by referring back to original writings (? Class A). It is summarized in the final statements \"There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt\" and \"Love is the law, love under will,\" which are printed in red. The Comment is signed by Ankh-f-n-khonsu, the scribe writing the manuscript (Ch. 1: page 9, verse 36). The initial A is characteristic of Aleister Crowley's signature. Since he \"shall not in one letter change this book,\" The Comment can apply only to the original manuscript of Liber XXXI. Whether The Comment is Class A is debatable. The statements printed in red are. If Crowley had classified it, there would be little debate about the classification. The earliest recorded reference to it as a Class A Comment occurs in Marcelo Motta's Commentaries of AL (1975). The authority of any subsequent person to classify libers, however, is moot. This document might better be called \"The Comment to Liber XXXI (the original manuscript).\" Even so, it also must be evaluated individually."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE The Book of the Law (1938) The edition of 1938, entitled The Book of the Law, Liber CCXX, was pub­lished in London.

Some editions have only the typeset version. Some include the manuscript facsimile. The distinction between the manuscript and typescript is important for study, as will be demonstrated in the analyses in the present book. Classification of Libers In A Syllabus of the Official Instructions of A.\". A.\". Hitherto Published (Equinox I (10): p. 43 (1913), Crowley lists the definitions for Classes A through D. Class \"A\" consists of books of which may change not so much as the style of a letter: that is, they represent the utterance of an Adept entirely beyond the criticism of even the Visible Head of the Organization. Class \"B\" consists of books or essays which are the result of ordinary scholarship, enlightened and earnest. Class \"C\" consists of matter which is to be regarded rather as suggestive than anything else. Class \"D\" consists of the Official Rituals and Instructions. Some publications are composite, and pertain to more than one class. Class A Publications The above definition derives from the series of statements within Liber L. (Note: the manuscript does not designate verse numbers for the first chapter.) I: page 9 (verse 36): My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; I: page 16 (verse 54): Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! Thou, o prophet shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 THE MYSTERY OF TilE LETrERS ANDTHETREB OF LIFB II: 54: ... The stops as thou wilt; the letters change them not in style or value! III: 47: This book shall be translated into all tongues; but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; fo r in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. The statement in III: 4 7 is particularly specific about the translation of Liber XXXI because it cites the reason for the caveat. Collectively, these statements guarantee that the original message of Hoor-paar-kraat can be known. By fo llowing them, later scholars can sepa­rate the original message from later human interpretations-each individu­al fo r himself. He may discern the mysteries not revealed to the scribe. Fortunately, Crowley took the dictation conscientiously, and made only minimal (but observable) changes. Unfortunately, neither he nor his succes­sors have always fo llowed the requirement of verse III: 47 that the \"original in the writing of the Beast\" accompany each published typeset version. Class A publications include inspired publications. Since few original manuscripts survive, basic research requires use of accepted authoritative texts. Most of these texts are fo und in Equi'nox I� especially in volume 7. The Holy Books ofThelema, Equi'nox III (9), is a critical, single-volume compen­dium. It omits Li'ber 418, The Vision and the J.Vice, and the note to Liber 963, The Treasure-House of Images. \"The chance shape of the letters and their position to one another are mysteries that no Beast shall divine\" is honored in the present study as strictly as possible. The principle is applied to all Class A material. The Class A publications are the primary exposition of principles of the lEon. In essence, they expand on the content of Liber XXXI in poetic or systematic fo rm. They expand knowledge, describe initiation, and provide material for understanding the mysteries of the lEon. The symbolism among the Class A libers is consistent. The present book demonstrates the inter­relationship among the symbols used among a few of the Class A publications."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I -INTRODUCTION 13 Even the organization of the libers gives clues to the symbolism in their contents, as fo llows: 3 -Creation fo rmula 0 = 1 = 2 Liber XXXI or L vel Legis (3 chapters, 65 pages) Liber CDXVIII vel Vision and the U>ice (30 lEthyrs), Voice of Angel 5 -Alchemical elements Liber LXV vel Cordis Cincti Serpente (5 chapters of 65 verses) 7 -Planets Liber VII vel Lapidis Lazuli (7 chapters) 10 -Sephiroth on the Tree of Life Liber XXVII vel Tr igrammaton.

The index page of the volume lists Liber Trigrammaton, but the relevant pages have been excised. No copy of this liber in Crowley's hand is reported to survive. Printed editions, beginning with Bt:A.rJpa Volume 3 (1909) have a consistent pattern and sequence for the trigrams and text.

The text version in The Holy Books of Bt:ArJJla (1983) is used here. Trigrammaton is a book of the mutation of the Tao ( •) with the Yang (-) and the Yin ( --). It includes, and expands on, the trigrams of the classic I Ching, one of Crowley's most frequent forms of divination. The trigrams describe creation as the interplay ofThree Principles. The book corresponds to the Stanzas of Dzyan (Blavatsky, 1888) in another system (though it is not followed here, for reasons explained later). Crowley relates the three principles or forces to Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. They relate to a passive (female, --) principle, an active (male,-) principle, and the union of the two (origin or equilibrium, •). They"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I -INTRODUCTION 15 correlate to the pillars on the Tree of Life (1L).

It is a mixture of Greek and Latin, with few familiar words. As with Trigrammaton� its complexity tends to deter magicians from detailed study. One Thelemite told me that it was just Crowley's joke. To which my response was only, \"Class A?\" The full title is: Liber Arcanorum twn Atu tou Ta huti Quad Vidit Asar in Amennti Sub Figura CCXXXI Liber Carcerorum twn Qliphoth cum sui Geniis.

He related it to the Hebrew alphabet and a well-developed system of symbolism that goes back to at least to the Sepher Yetzirah and Zohar. The only surviving part of the original manuscript of this tiber is one sheet at the University of London Senate House Library. It has pencil sketches by Crowley. The overlaid ink tracings could be either by Crowley as directions for J. F. C. Fuller, or by Fuller himself. Only Domus Mercurii sigils are included. The penciled Hebrew letter attributions are from Crowley. The sheet is significant because it shows the sigils as a composite arrangement. The sigils now attributed to Heh and Vau are not in the Hebrew letter order of the rest. The pencil marks at these sigils suggest that Crowley later recognized this. He noted the error in the penciled Hebrew letters where a light Heh is under the darker Vau. Crowley apparently gives notes to Fuller in three sections of pencil notes in the left-hand margin, as follows: General Design. May be a wheel with 22 components on the rim. The wheel has 8 spokes. At the corners are the Cherubim. But the Pillar Scheme is equally good. Note the change of i1 and 1.

Liber LXXVIII -A Description of the Cards of the Ta rot The Tarot trumps, their significance and sequence are among the most dis­cussed mysteries of occultism. Originally, they were used just in a card game. The cards then were used for divination. Eliphas Levi (1856) recog­nized their occult significance. In the late 19th Century, the Golden Dawn incorporated the Tarot into its comprehensive symbol system. Regardie (1940) finally published the material in his treatise The Golden Dawn. Crowley ( 1912) had already published the material from the Golden Dawn as Liber LXXVIII, \"A Description of the Cards of the Tarot,\" in Equinox I (8) . It records Crowley's understanding ofTarot symbolism at the time of the reception of Class A material."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I-INTRODUCTION 21 The Book ofThoth Near the end of his life� Crowley published The Book of Thoth (1944). This work is probably his most comprehensive synthesis of the symbol system for the lEon of the Child. It expands on the Thoth Tarot deck that he developed with Frieda Harris. The text gives insight into the meaning of the symbols. The book is cited as Class B, but without a number, in the appendix of Equinox III (9). It fits that definition, though the original publication gives no such citation. During his lifetime, Crowley wrestled with the interpretation of the Glyph in the first chapter of Liber XXXI and it place among the Tarot trumps. He first interpreted it as a Tzaddi in the unpublished proof of the Collected Wbrks, VOlume Ill (1907). He def ended his interpretation of the Glyph as a Tzaddi in the Extenuation of the Book of the Law (1926, unpub­lished manuscript). His explanation in The Book of Thoth involved both the switch ofTeth/Lamed (that he was aware of from his Golden Dawn train­ing) and the Heh/Tzaddi switch (his interpretation derived from the state­ment in Liber XXXI). Crowley's interpretation has presented difficulty to many Thelemites and other occultists. Sometimes, the controversy seems to outweigh the signifi­cance and meaning of the cards. For the present study, data relating to the sequence of the Tarot trump, tied to the Hebrew alphabet and the occult significance, are salient. The Mysteries The focus of the present study is based on the three-dimensional Tree of Life (Quantum Tree: QT) model through which the Mystery of the Letters is decoded. The analysis evolves from the original Tree of Life in 777 as understood by Crowley. The interpretation of the Class A and Class B mate­rial, described above, strives for a consistency of symbolic meaning. Class A material takes precedence over Class B. Liber XXVII vel Tr igrammaton revealed a three-dimensional QT arrange­ment of the sephiroth. Generally, it is congruent with the traditional Tree of Life (TL)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Liber XXXI clarifies information about the paths on the QT. This model reveals additional paths. These are not recorded in Class A libers or L£ber 777. The 32 Paths of Wisdom of the Sepher Yetzirah are interpreted differ­ently. The analysis also reveals interrelationships among the Hebrew, Greek and English alphabets . The Riddle in Chapter II: 76 is a listing of the paths on the QT. Liber CCXXXI further expands information about the paths, with emphasis on the Tarot and duality. Liber LXXVIII and The Book of Thoth add additional information about the occult Tarot. The fo rmer expresses Crowley's early concept. The latter one expresses his final one. Liber 777 treats the old Hebrew letters and their associated TL paths. Additional paths recognized on the QT are not included. Nor are the final letterforms included. Their understanding will need further research and revelation. The symbol system of the £on of the Child is a way of transmitting the message of Hoor-Paaar-Kraat. The inter-relationships among the approach­es strengthen communication, knowledge and understanding. To accom­plish this goal, the system must be consistent, rational, and intuitive. Anything else would create even more misunderstanding and illusion."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II -MESSAGES AND MODELS Messages FoR every message, there must be an origin, a messenger, a vehicle, and a recipient. For printed material, these are the idea, the words, the printed page and the reader. For art and symbols, there are the artist, the design, the medium, and the observer. For a computer, there are the data input (bytes), the application/platform, the electronic transmission, and the output. For radio and television, there are the scripts, the performance, the recording the broadcast, and the audience. Communication is not complete until a recipient has perceived it. The transmission of data may lead to knowledge, understanding and wisdom, as perceived by man. Interrelating messages from different dimensions is a daunting problem. Data distortion occurs when moved from one system, set of dimensions or medium to another. Some data become more apparent, others become more obscure or irrelevant. Prior conceptions are often hard to discard, especially when change is sudden. When data is processed systematically, results can be compared. They may be congruent, though they appear to be different. The £on of the Child is a system that opened just after the beginning of the 20th Century. It views the Universe in a distinct, and revolutionary way. The message sequence is: The Message The Messengers The System The Audience The Book of the Law Aiwass Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, Crowley The £on of the Child Mankind 23 Hoor-Paar-Kraat, Authority Revealer, Minister of HPK The Scribe/ Prophet Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Initiator Everyone, Thelemites"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Models One-dimensional (1-d) Models Alphabets and Numbers Every alphabet is an ordered series of letters. Every electronic message is a linear sequence of bytes. They are one-dimensional (1-d). With systematic transformation using an appropriate system, they can describe additional dimensions. Alphabets, numbers and bytes are the most basic symbol sys­tems. They combine to fo rm words and sentences, fo rmulas, and lines of code. In so doing, they create virtual multidimensional results. The Sepher Yetzirah, The Book of the Law, and Liber Trigrammaton are occult texts expressed in 1-d. Liber 231,TheAtus of Tahuti, has a 1-d text with 2-d diagrams. They each contribute to a composite Tree of Life model. Sepher Yetzirah The Sepher Yetzirah is a fo undation for a 2-d Tree of Life (TL) and Hebrew qabalah. It deals with the principles of the creation of the world and the way it exists, i.e., cosmogony and cosmology (Townley, 1993). Its significance still contributes to western occultism. The Sepher Yetzirah describes the fundamental principles of creation in thirty-two paths, traditionally defined as 10 sephiroth plus 22letters. It con­tains secrets believed revealed to Abraham. Kaplan (1990) provides several text variations and an extensive interpretation. He includes descriptions of the Tree of Life and the Cube of Space.

This is the original Mystery of the Letters."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II -MESSAGES AND MODELS 25 Liber Trigrammaton The trigrams of Liber Trigrammaton are in a linear sequence, therefore 1-d. Each trigram has three lines that have a Tao (•), Yang (-) or Yin (--) symbol. The combination of three lines taken three at a time and filled by one of three of these symbols makes 27 possible combinations. These can be arranged into a 3-d Cube of Space. Each of the 27 trigrams has a text that implies a sephira on the Tree of Life. As such, it also indicates a multi­dimensional aspect. Their interpretation forms the basis of the next chapter. Stanzas of Dzyan Crowley discusses Trigrammaton and the Stanzas of Dzyan as related sys­tems. Like Trigrammaton, the Stanzas are linear. Three points become immediately obvious: 1) It is a proposed description of evolution. 2) Cosmogenesis has seven verses. 3) Anthropogenesis has twelve. The description matches Trigrammaton in the broad sense, although it utilizes Greek mythology. In Cosmogenesis, the numbers match the first two series of Tr igrammaton. Anthropogenesis has 12 stanzas that agree in number with the 12 trigrams of the Third Series of Trigrammaton. An examination of the Stanzas indicates some further correspondence. The Stanzas of Dzyan were published by the Theosophical Society (Blavatsky, 1888) in The Secret Doctrine-a very extensive and complex commentary of the original stanzas about esoteric evolution. Maroney (2000) provides the original stanzas and selected commentary from the original as well as background and other material. In a specific ref erence to Crowley, Maroney mentions his commentary to The llbice of the Silence, and Crowley's own cosmological work, Liber Trigrammaton. He continued: So far, there is little scholarship that traces Blavatsky's influence on Crowley, which is much greater than generally"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE realized. Much of it takes the fo rm of references to symbolism prominent in Blavatsky, such as the point in the circle, the identification of the nature of people as stars, and the \"Day of Be-With-Us.\" Maroney continues: As regards the evolution of mankind, the Secret Doctrine postulates three new propositions, which stand in direct antagonism to modern science as well as to current religious dogmas: it teaches (a) the simultaneous evolution of seven human groups on seven different portions of our globe; (b) the birth of the astral before the physical body, the fo rmer being a model fo r the latter, and (c) that man, in this Round, preceded every mammalian -the anthropoids included -in the animal kingdom. The fo otnote to this paragraph cites evidence in Genesis I: 7 and II : 19. It includes a more detailed explanation relating to the different creations. Cosmogenesis describes how the universe is fo rmed by differentiations from a primordial unity. While a time scale is relative, the geological sequence is not. Crowley accepted ideas from Blavatsky. He included Liber LXXI: The U>ice in the Silence I The Tw o Paths I The Seven Po rtals in Class B. He refers it specifically to Trigrammaton. There is definite conflict between it and the current understanding of science. Its premises have been discredited by modern science, so it is not included further in the present study. Two-dimensional (2-d) Models Tree ofLife The Tree of Life model is a basic and historic arrangement of the Universe. The earliest examples occur in the Middle Ages. When the text of the Sepher �tzirah was translated into TL models, several interpretations of the arrangement arose. The TL model had no standard. Several interpretations and additions to the sequence of the sephiroth exist. Even the identity of the sephiroth was equivocal, as was the arrangement of the paths."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II -MESSAGES AND MODELS 27 The Hebrew Tree of Life (TL) is two-dimensional. It derives from the SepherYetzirah. Kaplan (1990) shows the arrangements ofsephiroth accord­ing to Ari (Isaac Luria (1534-1572) and Gra (Elijah ben Schlomo Zalman, 1721-1797). Hebrew qabalah attributes three mother letters to horizontal paths, the seven double letters to vertical paths, and the 12 single letters to diagonal paths. J, Gikatilla 1516. Po rtae Lucis. Augsburg An early illustration of the TL appears in Portae Lucis ( 1516) by Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla ( 1248-ca.1305). The Gra tree in Kaplan is similar in the arrangement of sephiroth, but the paths are labeled differently. The sephiroth in the later Ari version are closer to the modern TL arrangement, but the path arrangement is different. These two classic Hebrew qabalists show different interpretations of the TL.

In measuring an item, it is length, width and height (the X, Y and Z axes of mathematics). On earth, it is longitude, latitude and altitude. In space, it is longitude, latitude and light years. The last is a measure of separation from man, with the illusion that man is always at th e center of the Universe. The least distorted models appear to be 3-d -but any model is only an illusion of reality. The map is not the territory. I Ching The I Ching, a classic system, uses two trigrams (a hexagram) to depict the Universe. The Chinese used it fo r divination, as Crowley did regularly. The trigrams contained only Yang (-) and Yin ( --) lines. For interpreta­tion, any (or all) of the lines were mutable to the opposite type, so a related second hexagram added to the complexity. These trigrams are identical to the Fourth Series of trigrams in Liber Tr igrammaton. The sequence of the hexagrams is linear ( 1-d). The component trigrams can be separated separately and put on the X and Y axes of a chart. This produces the 2-d model used as an index. Using each of the lines of a trigram as a dimension, (X, Y and Z), a 3-d Cube ofTwo can be constructed. Each Cube can be arranged similarly as a unit within a larger Cube ofTwo with the same dimensions. The result is a Cube of Four. The Cube of Four arrangement distributes the 64 possible hexagrams in four dimensions. One Cube ofTwo (a set oftrigrams) represents 3-d Space. Its position in the larger Cube ofTwo represents Time. It does not matter whether the upper or lower trigram is considered first. This fits well with Einstein's Theory of Relativity, contemporary with The Book of the Law. Cube of Space The Cube of Space concept goes back at least to the Sepher Yetzirah. Its dimensions extend from an origin at the center of the cube. Each dimension has direction, positive or negative, away from the center."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II -MESSAGES A.'ID MODELS 31 The Hebrew qabalistic view attributes the three axes to the mother let­ters. The six faces of the cube, plus the origin, are the seven double letters. The 12 edges of the cube attribute to the single letters. Their occult attribu­tions relate to the elements, the planets and the zodiac, respectively. Townley (1993) elaborates five pairs of opposites (:::: dimensions). The sephiroth of beh\"mah implies the ten have no end: beginning and end, good and evil, height and depth of the abyss, depth of east and west, depth of north and south. God rules over all from His holy abode. He adds, from these dimensions the three dimensions of space (length, width, height = North/South, East/West, Above/Below), plus Time (beginning/ end). They define physical reality. The fifth dimension (which has not yet been discov­ered by physics), is the ethical one-good/ evil, according to the Sepher �tzirah. Each dimension has two contrasting ends or directions, which may later be related to the front and back of the TL, or positive and negative existence. The present study changes the perspective, based on the patterns in Tr igrammaton. Instead of describing the Cube from the center, it describes it from an apex. The defense is presented in the next chapter. A series of nested cubes becomes the Cube of One at an apex of the Cube ofTwo, and the Cube ofTwo at the same apex of a Cube ofThree. The Cube of One is Malkuth. The Cube ofTwo reaches from Malkuth to Da'ath. The Cube of Three reaches from Malkuth to Kether. A central linear core contains the three homogeneous trigrams-Kether (i), Da'ath ( ) and Malkuth (55). The original design had the sephiroth arranged in pillars, as in the 2-d TL. This arrangement makes it easier to compare the QT in a static situation to the TL. However, it does not show how certain paths vary in their occurrence. The helical interpretation resulted from the building a solid model. The erect form was unstable. The principle of dense packing caused the sephi­roth spheres to move into a stable helical form. Its form parallels the Double Helix model of the DNA molecule (Watson and Crick, 1953). Photographs of the model constructed using information in Tr igrammaton, are shown separately as color illustrations. The trigrams form four series, each defined by the number of Ta o ( •) elements-3, 2, 1, and 0. The odd numbered ones represent the lights (Kether and Sephiroth). The even ones represent the vessels of Briah (2 Ta os) and Da'ath, Ye tzirah and Assiah (no Taos)."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETI'ERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Liber Tr igrammaton has a built-in statement that suggests an extension into a Cube of Four. The first trigram (!) says: Here is Nothing under its three fo rms. It is not, yet informeth all things. If this trigram is Nothing under three fo rms, there must be Nothing without those three fo rms. Kether 111 (!), Da'ath 222 ( ) and Malkuth 333 (!55) have homogeneous trigrams. The extension of that diagonal of the cube would be trigram 000 (S), Ain. Three axes of three radiate from Ain. They represent the Ain Soph, the influence of which defines a Cube ofThree. The remaining 27 are the nega­tive analogs of Trigrammaton. They are the Ain Soph Aur, which equals the Qliphoth. As with the trigrams in the hexagrams of the I Ching, the two existences are relative to one another, so Positive and Negative Existence are interchangeable. One cannot be recognized without the other. As with the Cube of Space and the Biological Code, the Cube of Four culminates the series. The Quantum Tree has a mirror image or comple­ment. The Ain Soph defines both. The total number of units in each of the models is 64, the cube of 4 x 4 x 4. However, the present study is limited to the Cube ofThree, from Atziluth to Assiah. A further expansion awaits-call it Tetragrammaton. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley describes the Universe as the expansion of the number Four. A glimpse of this was seen in the I Ching, above. On some 2-d TL (a la Golden Dawn) above Kether are the Veils of Negative Existence. They appear in Liber 777 in line 0. These veils are included in the Cube of Four. Most trigrams have capitalized words in their associated text. These are taken as clues to the character of the trigram and clues to attributed sephi­roth. When there are no capitalized words, the sentence subject is consid­ered the most likely key word of the text.

Thy are the permuta­tions of three things, taken three at a time. It is the Cube of Three, or the Cube of Space. Two conjoined trigrams form a hexagram in the I Ching. In their intro­duction to The Original I Ching Oracle, Ritsema and Sabbadini (2005) wrote: The hexagrams of the Yi Jing are based on a binary code whose elementary units are the opened line ( --) and the whole line (-). The opened line is supple and is associated with Yin, the whole line is solid and is associated with Yang. Yin and Yang are the fundamental categories of Chinese cos­mology, the primary duality arising from the original One. Dao begets One. One begets two. Two begets three. And three begets the myriad beings. (Quoted from Lao Zi, chapter 42) The quotation implies that the zero may represent the Dao, and is before One. Trigrammaton presents two congruent models simultaneously. Crowley recognized the trigrams in the Cube of 3 x 3 x 3. He did not explore the 3-d relationship between the verses and the sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Both models are three-dimensional. His concept of the Tree of Life was 2-d. The tri-radiate nature shows in the three edges radiating from an apex. It requires little explanation. A distinct diagonal of the cube also connects to the opposite apex through the center of the cube. It is congruent with the Central Axis on the QT, below. 34"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III -l.JBER TRIGRA.\\iMATON 35 Several authors have proposed 3-d models of the Tree of Life (Achad, 1974; Regardie, 1971; Wang, 1983), but none is convincing. A new 3-d Quantum Tree (QT) model is proposed here. The construction of a hard model has satisfied the parameters-pillars, triads, sephiroth. They are comparable to those on the 2-d Tree of Life (TL) model. Crowley relates the three principles or forces to Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. They relate to a passive (female, --) principle, an active (male, -) principle, and the union of the two (origin or equilibrium, •). Two principles are the same as in the I Ching. Qabalistically, each trigram can be converted to a number. ln the I Ching� the Yang(--) uses the number two (2), and Yin (-) uses the number three (3). In Trigrammaton� number one (I) becomes the Tao (•). Each trigram then fo llows in a numerical sequence, reading from top to bottom. Numbers make the order of the trigrams easier to remember. A sephira is the combination of a vessel filled (in-formed) with light. In their position to one another, the trigrams form an index to the sequence of verses. The text follows the sequence of sephiroth on the TL or QT. The trigrams of Tr igrammaton are a linear arrangement of lights and ves­sels defining the sephiroth on the QT. There must be ten sephiroth, not nine, not eleven, as established in the Sepher Yetzirah I: 4 (Kaplan, 1990). Hebrew qabalah has two emanations of existence. In the First Emanation, Godhead created (and became separate) from the Universe. Light flowed toward the Universe. This ultimately caused a breakdown, called the Breaking of Vessels, Shevirah (i11\"::l�). The broken shards reformed as ves­sels of the sephiroth. Light from the Godhead filled them. Therefore, a sephira is a vessel fUied with light. The name of the first, Kether, comes from Exodus 31: 3. Chokmah, Binah and Da'ath are found associated in Exodus 35:31. From Chesed to Malkuth, the names come from 1\" Chronicles 29: 11. See also Proverbs 3: 13 to 20. According to The Wisdom of the Zohar (Lachower &Tishby, 1989), the identification ofindividual sephiroth varies. The hypothesis here posits Liber Trigrammaton as a systematic description of a Cube of Space model using trigrams. The diagonal of a cube is its lon­gest dimension. It goes from one apex through the center of the cub e to the opposite apex. This is congruent with the Central Axis of the QT. The three edges from one apex of the cube are analogues to the pillars on TL, or heli­ces on the QT. The trigrams for the lights and the vessels follow the sephi­roth in sequence. There are 27 trigrams, but only 10 sephiroth. This is resolved in the model."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36 THE MYSTERY OF THE LEITERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE THE CUBE OF SPACE Townley (1993) presents an analysis of the Cube of Space based on the Sepher Yetzirah. His cube orients from the center, with three perpendicular axes extending from it, and twelve edges. They are the origin, six directions (from three mother letters extending outward from the origin, and the 12 signs of the zodiac. These readily match the first three series with Ta o ele­ments (1, 6 and 12) of LiberTrigrammaton. Later he used a solid presentation, but still oriented from the center. The difficulty with any three-dimensional model presented on a plane surface (2-d) is that something must be omitted or distorted. Any isometric view of a cube will leave one corner and its adjacent surfaces hidden. By separating the units into layers, the arrangement converts the component cubes into three separate planes. In either case, when the distortion or sam­pling is systematic, the whole can be reconstructed from its parts. Cube of Space modified from Kaplan (1991) and Townley ( 1993).

Cube of One The interpretation of the Cube of Space using Tr igrammaton takes a differ­ent perspective from the central point of view of Kaplan (1990) and Townley (1993) . Instead, the trigrams are viewed in nested cubes, beginning at the low corner (Malkuth, 55, 333). Standing on that apex, a diagonal axis of the cube extends upward through the center to the opposite apex (Kether, i, 111). In the lower right corner is the Cube of One. It contains a single homo­geneous trigram with only Yin lines, 55, 333. It represents the Material World, the World of Assiah.

The trigrams are organized into four levels, indi­cated by the number ofYang lines. The trigram, with no Yang lines, is the vessel of Malkuth in Assiah, the Cube of One. The Veil of Paroketh separates it from the World ofYetzirah. Six trigrams have both Yang and Yin lines. They represent the vessels of the six sephiroth in Ye tzirah. Some call this the Astral World.

The number ofTao ( •) lines distinguishes them. Three Ta o lines indicate Kether, the World of Atziluth. It is pure light. Two Tao define the vessels of Briah. One Ta o line indicates lights in all other worlds except Atziluth. No Tao line indicates vessels in the Cubes ofTwo and One. The text for most trigrams has capitalized words.

The individual trigram accounts give specific details. The Sephiroth In Tr igrammaton, the text associated with each trigram provides information about the sephira. The sephiroth are treated in three-dimensional order. The vessels of the sephiroth each have an even number (none or two) Ta o lines. Their lights have an odd number (one or three). Within each sequence the order of the sephiroth on the Tree of Life (QT and TL) is maintained. Five worlds are distinct on the QT.

It is not, yet informeth all things. The World of Atziluth has only one trigram. The key words are Nothing under its three fo rms. This implies Nothing must also exist, but without form- a dilemma. It suggests the existence of the Cube of Four-Tetragrammaton. It is also not, but fills everything, 0 = 1 = 2 = oo. Liber XXXI 1: page 1 (verse 4) says: Every number is infinite: there is no difference. The first trigram symbolizes the unrestricted light of Kether in Atziluth. There is no corresponding vessel for Kether. Since a light and vessel com­bined define a sephira, Kether is not a sephira. Rather, it is distinct from them-super-sephira. Its light penetrates all sephiroth. It illuminates the vessel and shows their characteristics. All these lights occur in the Third Series. A vessel characterizes a sephira. The light reveals it. Lachower &Tishby (1979: 243ft) discuss the pre-existence ofKeter (sic) as eternal will.

It is possible that, in confor­mity with this approach, a new meaning is propounded here for the term azilut (emanation). It does not signify the way in which the sefiroth came into being. Their existence is \"by way of azilut,\" by the essence of God extending itself to, and dwelling within them, although an immanence both inseparable and continuous. Divine immanence is not limited to the upper realms ... There is no place where he is not, above without end, and below without limit ... This view of an all-embracing immanence seems to destroy the divi­sion between the divine \"sefiroth of emanation\" and the lower regions. The latter are arranged in the form of three worlds (creation, forma­tion and making-beriyah, yezirah, asiyah) each of which contains ten sefiroth or forces. 41 The identity of the ten sefiroth is not addressed specifically, but Atziluth is not included. The nature of Kether represents the light from the Ain Soph (not the Ain Soph Aur). The discussion indicates that it has not always been recognized as a sephira. When it is not, Da'ath is the substitute. There is a parallel discussion in Glotzer's (1992) presentation. \"Not\" may have been included as \"Nothing without form,\" or may present a different situation. It is worthy of further meditation. What is \"Nothing\" without three forms? It could be the non-form, qlipho­thic or backside of the TL or QT, the Ain, the Ain Soph Aur, or some­thing else.

The TL and QT attribute the Demiurge to Chesed. The Demiurge evolved from being a benign architect of matter to the personification of evil. In Timaeus, Plato (1989) refers to the Demiurge as the fashioner and shaper of the material world and good. The imperfection comes from the work of the Demiurge on pre-existing chaotic matter. In western mysticism and Gnosticism, the term Demiurge is the deity responsible for creating the physical universe and aspects of humanity. Gnostics distinguish between the original Creator and the Demiurge. The force of the Demiurge is one side of non-manifest vs. manifest, spiritual vs. material, good vs. evil.

The Book of Enoch Chapter VII: 1-15 (Laurence, 1983) gives a long account of the mating between fallen angels and the daughters of men, forming giants. See also the Biblical quotation found in Genesis 6: 4: The Nephilim were on the earth in those days-and also afterward-when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and bore to them the heroes of old, the men of the name. Enoch, Chapter LXIII: 1 states: I heard the voice of an angel saying: These are the angels who have descended from heaven to earth, and have revealed secrets to the sons of men and have seduced the sons of men to the commission of sin. This trigram represents the light of the giants, the Nephilim who mated with the daughters of men in the secret rite, and defiled them. In doing so, the secret of royalty and priesthood (Levi, 1913) was brought down to men-also the possibility of sin. The resulting giants (Titans) typified brute force and unbridled appetite.

Tantra is a system of beliefs and practices intended to stretch the mind and guide adherents to higher knowledge (Feuerstein, 1998) . It celebrates divin­ity in every being and thing. Adepts introduce practices and methods that are unusual and even sinful and degraded within traditional contexts. Some schools use ritualistic sex (maithuna). Flowers (1997) defined two approaches from this in practical terms. The Right-hand Path is the way of union with universal reality (God or Nature). The individual self is annihilated, and becomes one with the divine or natural order. In contrast, the Left-hand Path involves non-union with the objective universe. It isolates consciousness with­in the subjective universe, in a state of self-imposed psychic solitude, leading to perfection. The objective universe then harmonizes itself with the will of the individual psyche. It normally rejects conven­tional \"good,\" and embraces \"evil\" to gain permanent enlightened existence. By going against the accepted ways (antinomianism), the individual seeks to gain spiritual power. The western Left-hand Path is often associated with Satanism. Christians perceived many traits of the Left-hand path philosophy and religion as evil. Such seems to be true in some Gnostic texts. In Magick, Chapter 21, Of Black Magick, it states: The contrast between the Master of the Temple and the Brothers of the Left-hand Path is described. They practice Black Magic, and have not given every drop of blood into the cup of Babalon. They have trampled Love in the Race for self-aggrandizement.

The answer is given in the eleventh £thyr; when the Exempt Adept reaches the Frontier of the Abyss, his Holy Guardian Angel leaves him, and this is the one supreme terror of that passage. His Knowledge and Conversation should afterwards fall away into that blind horror whose name is Choronzon ... It is for this reason that the Great White Brotherhood admits no essential connection with the lower branches affiliated to The Order. At the same time, the Brothers of the A.\". A.\". refuse none. They have no objection to any one claiming to be one ofThemselves. If he does so, let him abide by it. The horror in Trigrammaron may refer to Choronzon who inhabits the Abyss. In The Vision and the J.bice� 12th £thyr, it states: And this is the meaning of the Supper of the Passover, the spilling of the blood of the Lamb being a ritual of the Dark Brothers, for they have sealed up the Pylon with blood, lest the Angel of Death should enter therein. Thus do thy shut themselves off from the company of the saints. Thus do they keep themselves from compassion and from understanding. Accursed are they, for they shut up their blood in their heart. The related footnote associates the BLP and BB, it says, Here is he first account of the Black Brothers of the Left Hand Path.

The Guard ofWater is easy to visualize below the Great Sea of Binah. The initiate faces the horror, Choronzon, when crossing the Abyss. The 1Oth lBthyr of The Vision and the llbice records Crowley's ex perience at the Abyss. His ritual for invoking Choronzon included a triangle into which Choronzon was invoked, a circle for the scribe, and a secret place for the seer. In that rethyr, Choronzon continually tries to seduce, distract, or taunt the scribe. The scribe was protected while within the circle.

The Yins imply females, holy nuns, associ­ated with emotion, love, and Venus. The mythic reference may be to Sappho and her students on the island of Lesbos, whose capital was Mytilene, a city referred to Netzach in Thelemic ritual. Sappho came from an aristocratic family. The daughters (? = nuns, virgins) of the elite were trained in singing, lyre playing and dancing in salons operated by older women. She operated one of the more distin­guished salons of her time. Sappho was perhaps the most famous poetess of ancient Greece. She lived on Lesbos from about 630 B.C.E. Poetry was part of the musical art. She wrote poems for accompaniment to the lyre. She showed a shift from the view of the gods and muses to a more personal approach. Her poetry was erotic, lascivious, active and passionate. She is sometimes referred to as the Tenth Muse, the Muse of Lyric and Erotic Poetry. Her poetic legacy is devotion to Aphrodite and lust for females. Then the world was patriarchal. Extra-marital sex was more accepted, but marital decorum was strictly defined. Affairs were pursued with abandon. Her Hy mn to Aphrodite may have been composed for a public rite cele­brating the status of the women•s mysteries.

The songs upon the lyre also suggest the fundamental forces that sustain existence. Music symbolizes the order and harmony of creation and a way to invoke the gods. The enlightened soul was symbolized by the sounds. Cirlot (1971) quotes the following: The lyre produces its sounds through the horns forming the sides of its structure, and representing the relationship between earth and heaven. It may also be a euphemism for the yoni, implied by similar­ity of shape. In this and the previous three trigrams, the word conceal is repeated. It is possible to interpret these four trigrams as protecting, or in a sexual context relating to transmission of the force, word or seed.

Who or what is the loathsome, unnameable thing? Hod characterizes intelligence, reason, because, possibly hiding the Tao.

The sensualists may be those using personal gratification in seeking the Tao. The firmament is the arch of the sky, through which the moon courses around the earth. The moon symbolizes illusion.

Crowley (1996) assigns the letter N to this trigram and says: The vibration which includes Life and Death as complementary curves. N is the traditional letter of Death. In a sense, Malkuth is the most manifest, farthest from the light of Kether, so the assignment here is understandable. The Shekinah in Malkuth suggests 0 may be the letter for Malkuth, the most receptive sephira on the TL and QT. This would complete the lAO formula as lights on the Central Axis. The Fourth Series -No Tao Lines Vessels ofDa'ath, Yetzirah and Assiah The eight remaining trigrams have only Yang and Yin lines. The I Ching is extremely old and well documented. The I Ching forms hexagrams by com­bining two trigrams. The eight trigrams (the Cube ofTw o) comprise the whole basis of this Chinese system. The sequence of the trigrams has varied since ancient times, but the interpretation is consistent. The traditional chart is 2-d. The text in Trigrammaton indicates an extension to a 3-d Cube of Four (4 x 4 x 4). Wilhelm/Baynes (1967, p. 262) includes the beginning of the Eighth wing as follows: In ancient times the holy sages made the Book of Changes thus: They invented the yarrow-stalk oracle in order to lend aid in a mys­ter ious way to the light of the gods. To heaven they assigned the num­ber three, and to earth the number two; from these they computed other numbers. They contemplated the changes in the dark and he light and estab­lished the hexagrams .... They put themselves in accord with the tao and its power ... and laid down the order of what is right ... they arrived at an understanding of fate."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"66 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETrERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE It comments further: The fundamental principles of the world are heaven and earth, spirit and matter. Earth is the derived principle ... Heaven is the ultimate unity ... The three axes of the Cube ofThree correlate to the pillars on the TL and QT. This leaves the Heaven/Earth (Chinese tradition), or Phallus/ Kteis (Crowley), or Creative/ Receptive dimension. The Fu Shi arrangement (Wilhelm/Haynes, 1967) is a distribution ofthe fo ur crossing at a common point. The TL combines this axis with the Tiphareth/Yesod axis to form a Middle Pillar. The QT separates the Tiphareth/Yesod axis from the Phallus/Kteis axis. The four remaining trigrams relate to the alchemical elements. World ofDa'ath Da'ath usually is not on the standard TL diagram. As a \"false sephira,\" its existence is declared moot. Calling it a separate World on the QT is a con­cept diff erent from the TL model. In Trigrammaton, the World of Da'ath is a single homogeneous sephira, a vessel ftl led with light. On the TL it is directly behind (eclipsed by) Middle Triad sephiroth. The God name in Assiah for Tiphareth is n.v11 m?� i11il' (YHVH Eloah v Da'ath) shows a qabalistic awareness of Da'ath behind Tiphareth. Gikatilla (1994), a 13th Century qabalist, in his Gates of Light discusses the sephiroth, which he calls spheres. The title of the book says that these spheres are gates and have light. On pages 226 to 232, he discusses DAT (= Da'ath). The significance of his discussion is: 1. The essence of DAT is the Middle Line, a reconciler of the lateral ones. 2. The Middle Line reaches to Kether. 3. Middle Line ascends to Ain Soph, to the Infinite. 4. DAT is considered third to Chokmah and Binah, and normally found between Gedulah and Geburah [Chesed and Geburah] 5. DAT ascends to Netzach and Hod, passes through Gedulah and Geburah to Chokmah and Binah until it reaches Kether. 6.

It passes through all, like the trunk of a tree, until it reaches Ain Soph. 8. The essence of DAT is the Sphere that includes all the spheres. 9. It is a mystery. These thoughts divide Gikatilla's Middle Line. They seem to separate Da'ath from Tiphareth, as on the QT. Da'ath rises from Malkuth up the Central Axis, past the three triads, and ends at the Ain Soph. See the further discus­sion under the vessel of Da'ath trigram 5, 222, below. Lachower &Tishby (1989, I: 247-248) says (attributing it to the Zohar II: 247b): The deeds of the Creator a re revealed and accomplished by means of the ten sefiroth, which were formed in order to be used as instru­ments for the divine activity: \"You are He who produced the ten tik­kunum (regulators), which we call ten sefiroth, so that through them you might guide the secret worlds that are not revealed, and the worlds that are revealed.\" They are given the names of divine forces and attributes, not as substances that belong to the divine realm, but simply as vessels that receive the divine influence. Kaplan (1990: 23-25) describes the equivocal nature of Da'ath as a sephi­ra as follows: With Wisdom, God established the earth, and with Understanding. He established the heavens, and with his Knowledge, the depths were broken up: (Proverbs 3:19, 20. It is likewise written, \"With Wisdom a house is built, with Understanding it is established, and with Knowledge its rooms are filled: ... Knowledge, however, is not a Sefirah, but merely the point of con­fluence between Wisdom and Understanding. In many ways how­ever, it behaves as a Sefirah, and it is thus often included among them. Da'ath is the connection above to the Heaven, and below to the Earth. The assignment ofDa'ath as a sephira and to an independent world is not a new concept. Its definition matches the other traditional sephiroth, except for Kether."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"68 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE 5, 222, Da'ath, Heaven, 0 Then only was Heaven established to bear sway; for only in the lowest corruption is form manifest. Four trigrams in the Fourth Series have reference to heaven. The light of pentagram=·=, 133, fills the vessel 5, 222, ofDa'ath, forming a sephira. This vessel trigram is the first to have no Tao line. The I Ching calls this trigram Ch'ien, Heaven and relates it to the sum­mer season. In the Fo Hsu or primal arrangement, it is south, at the top of the diagram. With K'un, winter, it forms the north/ south axis (Wilhelmi Baynes, 1967). It represents the great law of existence. Crowley's (1974) commentary on Tr igrammaton relates this trigram to Phallus, and the letter E. He describes the letter as softened, but otherwise unmodulated breath. World ofYetzirah The World ofYetzirah has six sephiroth. Its heterogeneous vessel trigrams have no Ta o element. They complement the six sephiroth of Briah. They share four- Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth and Ye sod, which occur in the Middle Triad in at least one phase of the QT. 55, 223, Chesed, Violent light, Air or lEthyr, A Also did Heaven manifest in violent light, Heaven is the abode of gods.

The word Bazak, which is found only in this one place in the Bible, is usually translated as \"lightning\" or \"a spark.'' According to other interpretations, Bazak denoted a flashing meteor or a bursting bubble. According to all these opinions, the Sefer Ye tzirah is stating that the Sefirot can only be visualized for an instant, and then they vanish. Wilhelm/Baynes (1967) calls this trigram Sun (Chinese term, not the Sun as a star), the gentle, penetrating wind, wood. In his Shih Y£, Crowley (1971) puts the trigram in Hod on the TL.

The comparison is to being struck by lightning rather than being sunburned. Wilhelm/Baynes (1967) lists this as clinging, light giving fire. This cer­tainly describes the Sun as the center of the Solar System. The related hexa­gram, Li, has the same name. Crowley ( 197 I) assigns this trigram to the Sun in the position of Tiphareth.

He relates the letter V to this trigram and says: Conscious male will. Manhood, strength, truth, righteousness immortality, integrity. (Water.). Crowley's description much better fits Geburah, Mars and fire. The Hebrew equivalent ofV is Vau (1), rod-shaped and phallic. The long list of characteristics implies maleness, appropriate to Geburah. Apparently, Crowley was not aware of the 3-d sequence of the trigrams switched Geburah and Netzach. When arranged in a 2-d numerical sequence, Geburah and Netzach switch positions reciprocally. His confusion is understandable. Three trigrams include two Yin lines, characteristic of the Lower Triad. The sequence is Earth, Moon, Water, as the single Yang line progresses from bottom to top.

Crowley (1996) does not assign a letter to this trigram, but he says: (Vulva). The process becomes circular. Here, Kether is in Malkuth. Malkuth is not a dead end. It is a process of continuous change and emanation. Malkuth contains light from the Third Series. The Direct Light from Kether becomes the Returning Light from Malkuth. The QT expresses activity. It is dynamic. The 27 trigrams are one more than 26 English letters. One trigram must have no letter (or possibly an obsolete one), or another letter is implied. Crowley gives no answer.

Liber XXXII: 57 starts with the invocation ofNuit, personification of the sky. Chapter II: 1 -4 describes her as non-manifest, the complement of Hadit. She is circumference of the sphere (the Universe) with Had at the center. From the viewpoint of Had, the only dimension is separation-but seeking union. The invoking individual perceives himself at the center of his Universe. Metaphorically he personifies Had. The outer limit of his Universe is the sphere of Nuit that is everywhere and nowhere. She is his background of stars. His invocation brings about alignment and union with Her, and his dissolution. Go outside the box, into the Universe. Expand consciousness. Love is the law, love under will. Love is a universal force toward union. It begins at the Creation of the World, with the formulas: 0 (Nothing) = 1, 0 = 1 = 2, and 0 = 1= 2 = oo (All). Liber XXXI I: 29-30 says: For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. To know anything requires contrast, such as: God and Universe, Macrocosm and Microcosm, dark and light, and male and female. It is a way of saying lA (M'?) = AL ('?M), or Nothing equals God.

They symbolize the difference in approach-water and fire. The dove was the signal that the Deluge was receding. It is a symbol of baptism and the descent of the spirit. The Serpent is associated with fire, the Messiah, Hebrew Messiach, n·tv� = 358. It has many connotations, especially in the previous reon. The Serpent is Nechesh, iDnJ = 358, the one that initiated Eve. The connotation is not evil, but one of enlightenment and initiation. He, my prophet, hath chosen We know Crowley's choice as prophet.

He chose the enlightening Serpent. The Law of the Fortress The Fortress is the Tower before it is lightning struck. Metaphorically, it is tradition, history or nature. The Law says even that which stands strong will ultimately fall. It is Yin/Yang, i:l, expressed in words. Within every situation is the seed of its own destruction. The Mystery of the Letters explores this formula. The message of The Tower is annihilation, the necessary precursor to creation. It is equivalent to the separation for the chance of union. Among the symbols on the Thoth card are: the Eye of Shiva (or Horus), the Dove and the Serpent, and Lightning (another early name for this atu). As a phal­lic symbol, it spews seed, pictured as yods on some earlier tarot decks. An illusion can be considered reality for thousands of years.

The path of the Star, immediately following, shows the early light emerging from the darkness. All these old letters of my Book are aright: The old letters refer to the Hebrew alphabet. At least, this was Crowley's interpretation, since he interpreted a Tzaddi in the second part of the sen­tence. The original Hebrew alphabet had 22 letters-Aleph (N) to Tau (n). After the Babylonian Captivity, the alphabet included the 22 old Hebrew letters plus five final letterforms. The alphabetical sequence traces back to tradition in the Zohar. Beginning with the letter Tau, each came before the Creator to propose that it be first in the Torah. Beth succeeded. Aleph with­drew. The letters are also numbers (alphanumeric) with traditional correla­tions. The statement in Liber XXXI I: page 18 recognizes this: all these old letters of my book are aright. In the Sepher Yetzirah, Hebrew letters have additional attributions. Th ese included elements, planets and zodiacal constellations. The elements and zodiac attributions are consistent.

After he died, Symonds and Grant (1974) first published text of The Extenuation of the Book of the Law (1926) in their Magical and Philosophical Commentaries. Shortly after, Regardie (1975) edited and published the Extenuation as The Law is fo r All. The first printing of Regardie's book included a facsimile of the manuscript as pub­lished in Equinox I (7). Subsequent printings are different. They quote from the New Comment to verse 1: 57 as follows: The 'old comment' covers the rest of this verse sufficiently for the present purpose. I see no harm in revealing the mystery ofTzaddi to \"the wise,\" others will hardly understand my explanations. Tzaddi is the letter of the Star, the Trump XVII. Aquarius and Aries are therefore counter­changed, revolving on the pivot of Pisces, just as the Trumps VIII and XI, Leo and Libra, do about Virgo. This last revelation makes our Tarot attributions sublimely, perfectly symmetrical. An enlarged scan of the Glyph, shown below, is from the first edition of The Equinox of the Gods (1936), Liber XXXI, page 18. This original in the writing of the Beast deserves careful observation.

No study using only the typeset version, Liber CCXX, reveals the problem. In The Equinox of the Gods, Crowley dis­cusses changes made to the manuscript, but omits comments about the Glyph. The thin circle and the lower right quarter arc are original. They look like the sun in the arms of the moon. The Glyph is a product of two different pens. The thin pen stokes underlie the thick ones. The thin strokes match the handwriting in most of the manuscript. The elements in thicker pen are later additions. (The pen appears to be the same as the one used by Rose Kelly to make other changes on the manuscript.) The additions make the Glyph more like Tzaddi. They must have been added before 1912."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE A second aspect of the interpretation of the Glyph relates to the part of the sentence following the colon, with the apparent contradiction. but -.S?: is not the Star By interpreting the Star, as he does, Crowley incorporates the tarot trump into the verse and with the Hebrew alphabet. Levi (1856) established an occult significance for the Tarot trump by connecting them to the Hebrew alphabet. Crowley, interpreting the Glyph as a Tzaddi, resolved his paradox by switching Heh and Tzaddi. However, his action is logically unsupportable for a closed set. The Hebrew alphabet is an \"aright,\" closed set of 22 letters in definite order. By making the reciprocal switch of Heh and Tzaddi, Crowley \"corrected\" the Star (though Tzaddi had been stated as aright). The Emperor (implied and traditionally Heh) changed from its aright attri­bution, now became not aright. Crowley had produced reciprocal errors. Consider changes in the closed set of 22 \"old\" Hebrew letters. Presumably, this does not include the new finalletterforms, added later. 1.

If the Glyph is outside the original set of Hebrew letters or its attributes, what is it? This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise. From the Old Comment in Equinox I (7), Crowley clearly interpreted this line as applying to himself. As prophet of the lEon, this is understandable. There is much in Liber XXXI he was told he would not know. One must know a secret to reveal its explanation, not just be aware of its existence. A clue to interpretation is the word wise. Wisdom requires the application of knowledge and understanding.

From a Thelemic perspective, what does this new revelation about A'in mean? Atu XIII, the Path of the Devil, becomes the Path of Horus I Set. The exoteric Devil is the Goat of Mendes, Levi's Sabbatic Goat, or Baphomet, in Capricorn ('fJ). Crowley maintains the Goat in the design in the Thoth card. The goat has a cap of grapes, signifying reproductive force or fe rtility. Its horns are long serpentine helices. Both Levi and Crowley associate Baphomet with Pan and reproductive fo rce. The helical horns suggest the spiral(= helical) fo rce of the Universe (and the QT model). Saturn, the ruler, is Set, the ass-headed god of the Egyptian deserts. He is the god of the south. The name refers to all gods containing these conso­nants, such as Shaitan or Satan. Essential to the symbolism are the sur­roundings-barren places, especially high places. Crowley ( 1944, p. 105ft) attributes the eye in the fo rehead of the Goat representing upon the highest and most secret mountains of the earth, the Himalayas, to the god Pan. The averse pentagram with the head of the ass, or the head of Baphomet inscribed, is another symbol. With the New lEon comes a new interpretation. Crowley alludes to a different, esoteric symbolism with the eye on the fo rehead of the goat, and the testes below. In Liber DCLXXVI vel Pyramidos, the candidate says, \"I am blind and emasculate.\"The qliphothic sigil for A'in in Liber CCXXXI shows a blind fa ce and dissociated male genitals. What underlies this? The symbol of the Eye and the Testes is that of Horus-Set and their reconciliation in Egyptian myth. A detailed analysis of the myth in Seth, God of Confusion, Te Velde (1977) devotes a whole chapter to Seth, the enemy and fr iend of Horus. The strength drained is sexual, as opposed to physical strength. The point of the scorpion is the seed of Seth. He has discharged his seed into the body of Horus. Seth is a member of the Ennead, the nine primeval Egyptian gods. Horus is his nephew, the son of Osiris. Seth is the cause of disorder. Horus, his nephew via Isis, unlike earlier generations, is not hermaphroditic, and sym­bolizes good and order. Te Velde interprets the battle where Horus and Seth wound one another. The battle is the homosexual relationship initiated by Seth. Seth was not castrated but made impotent through losing his seed. Horus loses an \"eye.\" The eye is reduced, and drips the seed. Seth abused Horus."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"114 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE HORUS AND SET UNITED, CHURCHWARD (1910) The value of A'in is 70.

The Egyptian ritual of completing the eye considers Horus and Set in polar antagonism, different from an antinomian belief in God/ Satan. Harmony is reached when Horus and Seth are united. The testicles of Seth represent savagery, unbridled nature and unruly urges. It complements the eye of Horus and makes a balanced whole. Lurker (1974) suggests evidence for the last possibility.

He was a manifestation of Horus (the Child). His symbol was the royal symbol of the winged disc. A quote follows: Because of the Egyptians' dualistic world, Horus gained a rival in his uncle Seth. Horus lost an eye in the battle between them, but in the end, the two deities were reconciled in rulership over the 'land of the Nile.' Seth usually appeared as a god over Upper Egypt and Horus as a god over Lower Egypt. In later Egypt Horus was regarded as the ruler of all Egypt, whilst Seth remained god of the infertile desert ... The analogous joining of two parts of Egypt is symbolic of joining of Macrocosm and Microcosm. Seth is an earlier, original, dark, and under­world god.

The words, o prophet, seem to address Crowley as scribe during the dictation of Liber XXXI. He was told that he would not know the answer to the Riddle. He wrote down the original text faithfully. He did not understand it, and never tried to solve it. In his Djeridensis Comment, Crowley expressed his role as the prophet of the lEon.

First: It declares a way to protect the integrity of the message of Hoor-Paar­Kraat, through Aiwass, to Ankh-af-na-Khonsu (or Crowley) as scribe. The message needs wide distribution. The details of the message in the manu­script are protected by facsimile reproduction of the manuscript. Therefore the admonition is, but always with the original in the writing of the Beast. The facsimile takes precedence over all typeset versions. Second: Details include the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another. For deciphering the mystery of the letters, the facsimile is critical. It provides the rationale. Third: Crowley was told he would not understand the mysteries of the letters. Yet, he did investigate it (evidence-the grid on page 16), even though he was told twice that he would fail. Fourth: Crowley alludes to the one who cometh after in his Old Comment. He alludes that the New Comment has a qabalistic solution. Fifth: This line drawn is a Key. This is the largest single stroke in the entire manuscript. It is absent from all typescript editions of Liber CCXX. The line begins between the words chance shape, and emphasizes them. The slope reflects the direction between Geburah and Yesod.

Like Liber Tr igrammaton, its components require individual interpretation as well. They provide depth to understanding of the path characteristics, and remind us of the advantages of exploring interrelationships. It is a Class A liber. First, the liber correlates the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet to the Tarot Trump. The alphabet is a index to the occult nature of the paths. Eliphas Levi recognized that principle in the mid-19th Century. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley (1944) greatly expanded on this symbolism. Second, it has two tables of sigils, Mercuric and Qliphothic, with one sigil for each letter. Each sigil has underlying messages for individual explo­ration. These two series form Liber XXII, the number of old letters in the Hebrew Alphabet. They show different aspects of the alphabetic paths. These sigils, especially those on the qliphothic side, have been previously explored more than other parts of the liber. All can be invoked, scryed for meaning through astral travel, and for sigil analysis, comparing their details to other known symbols. An invoking ritual for knowledge, to Thoth or Mercury, such as Beth-2 in Appendix V, opens the mind of the student. Third, between the charts of sigils is a list of alphabetic pairs. The left hand column has the Hebrew letters in order. The right hand column has duplicates, and some letters missing. Whether the comparison directs the magician to compare only within each of the series, or between series is not clear. The magician should use his own imagination. This can be difficult before he has some understanding of the individual sigils and their descrip­tion of initiation. Fourth, it gives a text description for each path. This is the heart of the Liber CCXXXI, sensu stricto. The Book of Thoth text and the Tarot Trump card often reflect it. Fifth, it lists the Mercuric and Qliphothic genii in parallel columns, relat­ing them to the Hebrew alphabet. It only includes the paths on the Tree of Life (TL). It does not include the additional paths revealed on the Quantum Tree (QT). 124"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CHAPTER v-LIBER CCXXXI 125 The analysis of the names presumes that Hebrew or Greek linguistic roots, indicated by syllables, have underlying meaning.

Mercury is action, the law of rea­son, of duality, of chance. Wisdom and writing are also attributes of his Egyptian counterpart, Thoth or Tahuti . The Magus was known historically as the Magician, the Trickster. With the Fool the combination becomes wisdom and fo lly, truth and uncertainty, and to the dynamics of Creation.

Creation avoids the uncer­tainty of a random universe. Beth is the messenger energy-intelligence that expresses the unity of an all-embracing Force of the Lord. He continues, the intelligence of Beth is the interaction between his intelligence and higher cosmic intelligence. Beth is the metaphysical gateway between the two. Beth is the secret of Chokmah. It is the ultimate balance or blessing. The lightnings, or the Lightning Flash is the message fr om the Ain Soph through Kether. It penetrates space created by the withdrawal of the First Emanation. After, the universe could share light through the sephiroth. Lord Tahuti (:::: Thoth) symbolizes wisdom, knowledge, and communica­tion-theVoice, the Word. He is the messenger, the scribe, the Egyptian god who invented writing. He is also Hermes or Mercury, a psychopomp to the Fool on his initiatory journey. The Vo ice from the Silence is the source of the message in Aleph. Voice is communication. Silence is Nothingness. Ecstasy comes when the Voice and the Silence, subject and object, achieve union. This process is a two way street. To balance this relationship, and to make the man in the image of God (? or vice versa), the sephiroth had to be able to share. They had to both receive and reflect light. The Breaking of Vessels and fo rmation of the Second Emanation produced the qabalistic light and vessels that define a sephira. Then the One ran and returned. The lightning flash, the Voice from the Silence, goes fr om Kether to Malkuth. The vessel of Malkuth reflects the light back toward Kether. The Mercuric genius of Tau, Thath'th'thitht thuth-thiZ, may bring the returning Word back to Chokmah. Sigils The Qliphothic Sigil shows a solar boat at night, with a crescent moon above.

However, it is an energy-intelligence of great power when combined with Gimel. The two letters parallel the Ya ng and Yin, the giving and receiving powers of the universe.

The symbols at the middle of each wing are roses. The right rose is dark; the left one is light. The dark rose derives its color from the blood of Adonis, or Venus, or Cupid. It suggests that the dark rose in the sigil should be red. This reinforces the sexual symbolism, or the union of the alchemical red and white tinctures. The sigil summarizes the Great Work. It interprets the Stele of Revealing in Liber CCXX 1: 14, but at a less esoteric level.

Her sword was two-edged to judge the righteous qualities of a man. The sword was the fulcrum of the scale, the point of balance. The fe ather, sensitive to the slightest movement of air, determined even the slightest variation from balance or truth. Fate is the karma that is symbolized by the previous path. It is completed before an individual enters the Hall of Maat. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley called this path Adjustment.

He takes his seat in the East (the golden dawn) and becomes the beneficent Initiator of the lEon of the Child. See Liber XXXI 1: page 13 (verse 49). The symbolism is different from the Hanged Man as the sacrificial god in the previous reon. Initiation is stressed over sacrifice. The Book oj Thoth attributes the traditional assignment of Mem to water. It refers especially to its spiritual aspect in initiation. Initiation is a baptism which is sacramental rebirth, hence the Hanged Man symbolism. Crowley continued that adepts of the INRI-lAO formula invented the Hanged Man in the lEon of Isis. The path is not a symbol of sacrifice in the current reon. Crowley writes: If ever things get bad like that again, in the new Dark Ages which appear to threaten, this is the way to put things right.

The idea of excess is expressed by the overabundance of water, produc­ing the Deluge. The cloud, God, is pouring water on the earth. The world was sacrificed in the flood. Noah and his family survived in the ark. The Flood can also be seen as an analogue of the change of reons. The water comes from the North, the darkness, indicated by the arrow. The light ultimately replaces it. NVH, or im, has a value of 61, Nothing. There had to be destruction before the earth could flourish again. Imbalance and overabundance had produced the need fo r rebirth. The value of Mem is 40, the number of days and nights of rain. In the Mercuric Sigil for Mem the cross and triangle, is the symbol of the Golden Dawn. The large scaffold may be the same as in the qliphothic sigil for Daleth.

The rose symbolizes completion and perfection according to Cirlot ( 1962). The pearl suggests a chosen one. It is a symbol of the mystic center and sublimation in man. It is a symbol of the human soul. The garlands therefore are symbolic of the successful process of initiation of the regener­ated man.

This Greek letter indicates the guttural sound of soft [gg] (as in haggartf) or [gh] (as in rough or cough). Its numerical value is 6, a double Gamma(= 2 x 3).

Any changes can be readily seen and evaluated. The other Class A books, plus The Vision and the t-bice, elaborate its message. The Book of the Law uses an ancient Egyptian mythology of god forms-Nuit, Hadit, and Horus (Heru-Ra-Ha = Hoor Paar-Kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khuit)-to personify the operation of the uni­verse. The defming message of The Book of the Law is based on the authority of Hoor-Paar-Kraat. He transmitted it through Aiwass to Crowley. Crowley became the prophet of the lEon. It is evidence of his contact with the gods, or a Secret Chief. Crowley believed the scribe Ankh-af-na-Khonsu (of the Stele of Revealing) was his earlier, manifest reincarnation. The underlying approach to Thelema is dualistic. Without contrast, knowledge cannot be recognized. The original monad reveals itself by pro­ducing the dyad. One side of the dyad divides again, making the contrast more evident. In contrast, love is the return of the dyad to the monad, the ecstasy of union. Thelema emphasizes respect for the individual. Its thrust involves Will (Thelema) and Love (Agape). This is succinctly stated in Chapter One of all versions of The Book of the Law: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that and no other shall say nay. Love is the law, love under will. I: p. 10-11, verse 40 I: p, 11, verse 42 I: p. 17, verse 57 While these statements may seem to give carte blanche for individual behavior and belief, it is illusion. A Star can believe what he will, that does not guarantee the veracity of his belief. First, each individual must determine his Will. This is neither easy nor quick. It is easy to confuse Will with whim. Second, each individual must apply his Will responsibly. This requires constant evaluation and respect for principles, and applying them to daily life. 211"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"212 THE MYSTERY OF THE LEITERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Third, each individual must respect the Will of others. To expect freedom and respect, the individual must extend the same toward other Stars. Each individual determines his own relationship to the Universe and its Mysteries. The motto of The Equinox: ''The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion,\" professes that Science and Religion have the same goal. Only their approach is different. Symbols, letters, words, numbers and formulas transmit the Mysteries. These symbols are interrelated and have traditional and accepted meanings. With the £on of the Child, they take on new interpretations. Understanding them enriches the path to Will and achieving initiation. The Class A libers provide guidance. They culminate in a system for organizing knowledge. The system is demonstrated here, using a few key references. Liber XXVII, Liber Trigrammaton presents two congruent 3-d models of the Universe-the Cube of Space and the Quantum Tree. These models provide bases for decoding the Mysteries of the £on of the Child. Trigrammaton deals with sephiroth in Worlds. Each sephira has a light and a vessel. A particular Mystery oiTrigrammaton involves the central position of Da'ath, Knowledge. It is the only World (sephira) connecting directly to all other worlds. It straddles the Abyss. Liber XXXI, The Book of the Law, presents the Mystery of the Letters, the paths on the Tree of Life. Secrets are hidden within the text of the original manuscript, but not in the typeset editions. The letters name the paths that connect sephiroth. The Mysteries of the Glyph (Chapter I), the Riddle (Chapter II), and the Line and Circle Squared (Chapter III) are interpreted. They extend into the alphabet, the numbers and Tarot trump. The Mysteries of Initiation occur in them all. Liber CCXXXI, the Atus of Ta huti contains a composite set of symbols describing the course of Initiation. It correlates to the 22 Hebrew letters, which function as an index to other correspondences. The Mystery of the Tarot lies in its dual nature, and its final return to unity. Liber CD XVII, The Vision and The 1/bice projects a view of the £on of the Child into the future. The voice of the Angel has authority like The Book of the Law. The import of its message will grow as the lEon progresses. Crowley invoked the 30 £thyrs in ascending order, culminating with the 1St £thyr.

Crow on 3 July 1944. Of course, as you point out, many people, most perhaps, have not yet mastered the Osiran formula, and, of course, it still works and has in fact to be used for nearly everything by most people. But what we need is a genius to work out the dynamics of the formula of Horus. Of this I am, for all prac­tical purposes, totally ignorant. The Book of the Law gives manifold instructions, mostly difficult, some seemingly almost impossible, but that is only in the eyes of one born and bred in the Old Aeon. Some of the rituals in Magick (appendices [of MTP]) may be considered as adumbrations of the new formula. There must be a lot of information in the secret meaning of much in the book. Abrahadabra, 418 and Mahashanah ... but we must wait for that genius. The paragraph shows Crowley's foresight about the evolving lEon, and the importance of The Book of the Law. This is a capstone to his legacy and his prophecy.

Chapter I: Had! The manifestation of Nuit. Chapter II: Nu! The hiding of Hadit. Each verse identifies the non-manifest viewpoint for its chapter. Had! and Nul are manifest, Nuit and Hadit are non-manifest. See Crowley (1976), Magick in Theory and Practice, page 1 , for Crowley's statement about this. The two chapters end as follows: Chapter I: The Manifestation ofNuit (= Had) is at an end. Chapter II: The end of the hiding of Hadit (= Nu); and blessing and worship to the prophet of the lovely Star. The last verse of each chapter indicates the end or dissolution of the mani­fest through union. This reflects the text of Chapter I, page 7: For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world that the pain of division [distance] is as nothing and the joy of dissolution all. Extend a parallel analysis to the Third Chapter. There should be no dispute about the diff erence existing between the first word in Liber XXXI, the manuscript and that in Liber CCXX, the typeset versions, seen above.

One Textus Receptus, photographically guaranteed. One High Court of Interpretation, each for himself, alone. No Patristic logomachies! No disputed readings! No civil wars and persecutions ...

Ahaahadabra becomes a manifest expression of the \"reward ofRa-Hoor-Khut.\"Without the T, this could be Ra-Hoor or Ra-Hoor-Khu. By Hebrew qabalah the numerical value of Ahaahadabra is 222, in con­trast to the 418 for Abrahadabra. In Greek and English kabalah, they are 122 and 218 respectively. Half of 418 is 209.

In its hieroglyphic acceptation, it characterizes unity, the central point, and the abstract principle of a thing. As a sign, it expresses power, stability, continuity ... It takes the place of the emphatic article ii [h] either at the beginning or at the end of words.\" The Heh (E, HE) is the symbol of universal life. It represents the breath of man, air, spirit, soul; that which is animating, vivifying. \"HA, Nii, is every evident, demonstrated and determined existence. It is every demonstrative movement expressed in an abstract sense.\" The difference between 209 and 222 is 13, Unity, Achad, 1mt. The \"reward\" ofRa-Hoor-Khut (non-manifest) is as the manifest Chief Seer (of the lEon) as One, or alone. The product ofNuit and Hadit. He is the titular non-manifest Lord of the lEon.

HPK takes his seat in silence, like the origin, the Ain (1'.1(), the sun behind the son (RHK). HPK is in the North, at midnight (Khephra). RHK is in the east, at dawn. The obverse of the Stele of revealing shows Ankh-f-n-Khonsu making an offering to Horus. The translation of the hieroglyphic box above the falcon­headed god in Equinox III (9): 241 includes \"Ra Hor khut chief gods.\" This designation parallels the qabalistic analysis of Ahaahadabra as Chief Seer or Prophet and Unity (or Chief, or First). The text of liber XXXI I: page 13 (liber CCXX I: 49) describes his taking his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods. So, the \"reward of RHK\" is as the manifest Chief Seer or Prophet of the lEon. Crowley calls the present reon the lEon of the Child, Heru-Ra­Ha. Liber XXXI states that not all secrets would be revealed to Crowley. Some are hidden in the \"chance shape of the letters, and their position to one another.\" We have no idea what Crowley actually heard during the dic­tation by Aiwass, only what he wrote down. His interpretation of the manu­script is personal and enlightened. However, each Thelemite must interpret the original message and text as an individual to fm d his personal meaning."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"236 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Appendix III The Formulas in Liber V vel Reguli Liber V vel Reguli, a Class D publication of A.·.

Crowley provides discussion and explanations fo r these formulas in Magick in Theory and Practice (1976). What is their distinctive application to the lEon ofThe Child? 6Jd.17J1a and Aya1r17 are Greek words for Will and Love occurring in The Book of the Law as \"Love is the law, love under will.\" They express universal principles of the £on.

The Hebrew equivalent ,l'N'! also has a value of 93. See Chapter V in MTP. Crowley attributes the digamma to the Manifest Star. The Great Work is to transform the initial F of Assiah (material illusion) to the final F of Atziluth. He includes a description of the attributes of the lAO formula in different lEons. Crowley uses 0 equivalent to A'in. One interpretation of the basic lAO formula has A between the \"I\" of Hadit and the \"0\" ofNuit. The \"A\" is the Child Horus, Ra-Hoor-Khuit as the transform.

The value of Upsilon (afterTau) in Greek usually is 400. In English kabalah, the U and V fo llow sequentially, and have a value of 6 as well. LASh TAL Crowley's gematria and explanation of the fo rmula LASh TAL is more cre­ative. It is the only one of the five not explained using Greek kabalah. He published this formula first in Liber Reguli. He provides a detailed interpre­tation and defense of his understanding in MTP pp. 334ff. Grant (1972) expands on the significance of Set and the LAShTAL fo rmula. Crowley's analysis uses Hebrew gematria and the numbers indicating the sequence ofTarot trump. LA + AL = K'? + '?K = 31 + 31 by Hebrew Qabalah Sh + T = tD + � = 300 + 9 by Hebrew Qabalah Sh + T = XX + XI = 31 by Ta rot Atus, Marseilles sequence. This is heterogeneous. The numbers for the trump used by Crowley fo llow the Marseilles deck sequence (ca. mid-18th Century). These numbers were established prior to the uncovering of the Teth/Lamed switch. Its occult significance was not recognized or attributed to the Tarot until the mid-19th Century. As a Practicus in the Golden Dawn, Crowley learned that the letter Te th, �,J?, numerical value 9, applied to the card then called VIII Strength or Fortitude (Kuntz, 1996, p. 117). It is fo und in Liber 777 and Magick in Theory and Practice. In column XIV, the sequence of the trump names fo l­lows the Hebrew alphanumeric system without the blind. Strength is Atu VIII. Adjustment is Atu XI. A further detailed discussion of LAShTAL is fo und in Magick in Theory and Practice. This was a switch from Atu XI, its position in the Marseilles deck. It explained one of the \"secrets\" of the Golden Dawn. Crowley reverted to \"XI\" and renamed the Strength card \"Lust\" in his Thoth Tarot deck."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"240 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE Both the lEon (Shin= Atu XX) and Lust (Teth = Atu XI. sic) in the Thoth Tarot sequence can be interpreted as Babalon riding the Beast. Refer also to the Sigils in Domarum Mercurii fo r Teth and Shin in Liber 22 I Liber 231. The significance of this fo rmula is ShT =Set= Satan as the mediating fo rce between LA(= Not, Nuit) and AL (=Law, God). ShT can be read as the Fire of Lust, or Fire and Force. Since it is unique to Liber Reguli, what makes it apply to the \"Energies of the Aeon of Horus\"? Surely just 93,per se, does not suffice. Crowley's \"force and fire\" (= Teth and Shin) describes the energies. Shin/Teth occurs in the spelling of Satan. Two occurrences in the Hebrew Bible are in Job 1: 12, as \"the Satan,\" 1�iDi1 and in Psalm 109: 6 as \"and adversary,\" 1�iV1. This is Satan separate from God, and Satan standing at the right hand of the wicked, respectively. The approach to LASh TAL, here, uses Greek or English kabalah instead. Then it is parallel to Crowley's other explanations. The l.A and AL each still have a numerical value of 31 in both Greek and English kabalah. The Greek ShT = Set = E + e = 200 + 9 = 209. Sigma (L) relates Tarot Atu XX The lEon. Theta (f9) and Old English Eth (a), with their value of 9, agree with the proposals of Levi, and published in the Golden Dawn Cipher Manuscript. This leaves VITI Lust, attributed to Leo, in the heavenly zodiacal sequence. Crowley's double twist in The Book of Thoth, page 11, is unnecessary. The sequence fo llows the tarot trump order given in the 1st lEthyr of Liber 418, The Vision and the Voice. It fo llows the concept of Fire (E, Atu XX. Aeon) and Force ( e, Atu VIII. Lust). The number 209 doubled is 418, Abrahadabra. Its Greek value is 218.

Ra-Hoor-Khuit has taken his seat in the East (XXXI I: 49), who in \"his secret name and splendour\" (Heru-Ra-Ha) is the Lord (of the New lEon) initiating. He is the Lord of the Double Horizon, east and west, with the wand of Double Power. Could ShT = Shin/Tau be an alternative interpretation? A further view may broaden the application and understanding. The follow­ing is a proposal, not a replacement, for ShT as explained by Crowley. The Golden Dawn exposed theTeth/Lamed switch to be a b lind. Instead of the ShT representing Shin/Te th, could it represent Shin/Tau? The com­parison may add dimension to the message of the formula. Alternate expressions or symbols hide secrets from the profane. They can only be revealed by explanation, and their meaning relevant. The true mean­ing is therefore protected from corruption. For example, an Aleph (X) can be converted to a Tzaddi (�) simply by re-arranging the lower left corner. A Cheth (n) can easily be misread as a Heh (i1) when a reader misses the gap in the upper left (Abracadabra vs. Abrahadaba).

Different letters with"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"242 THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE similar sounds can be interchanged, e.g. , Samech and Shin, Kaph and Qoph. Silent letters can be added to produce particular totals. The resolu­tion depends not only on \"mechanics,\" but also on a contribution to a par­ticular understanding of truth. In the case of Liber V vel Regu/i, it must relate to the \"Energies of the 1£on of Horus,\" the object of the ritual. During the 201h Century, the perception of man moved into 3-d. Not only does man perceive the universe that way, he views his ritual and life within that universe as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Man perceives the universe more scientifically. These correlate well to the birth of the 1£on of the Child. The motto of the Equinox is \"The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion.\" About the time of the revealing of The Book of the Law to Crowley in 1904, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) put forth his theory of special relativity in 1905. Einstein proposed the concept of a space/time continuum. The effects of this paradigm shift moved the concept of the universe into multi­dimensional reality. On earth, latitude, longitude and altitude are the three spatial dimensions, plus time. In the universe, we now see the equiva­lents-celestial latitude and longitude (as on a star map) plus distance rela­tive to the point of observation, measured in light-years (time). Separate time does not exist. Contemporaries of Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) and Carl Jung (1875-1961) expanded the understanding of psychology to the nature of consciousness. All were rooted in the lEon of Osiris, but were influential in shaping understanding in their time. On the scientific and technological side, the United States took over the failed French attempt to build a Panama Canal It began construction on 4 May 1904. The first ship went through in 1913, and it was formally opened on 15 August 1914. This is contemporary with the reception of many Class A libers in Thelema. Yellow Fever was controlled. The canal was the most massive engineering project since the Great Pyramid. The canal shortened the trade route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It expanded the role of the United States in world trade, and changed the world balance of power. Crowley's awareness of Einstein's theories at the time of his publishing Liber V in Magick in Theory and Practice is implied. There is more evidence in The Book of Th oth (1944). Ta rot Atu XX is generally known as The Judgment or Last Judgment. It has an apocalyptic connotation, i.e., the end of time and a heavenly renewal. Crowley renamed this card Atu XX, The"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"APPENDIX ill : THE FORMULAS IN LIBER V VEL REGUU 243 lEon in his Thoth deck. In doing so, he expanded an esoteric meaning for the lEon of Horus. The design of the card is much different from the older classical decks. Atu XX is traditionally attributed to the Hebrew letter Shin, fire and change. This shows in the sigil for Shin in Liber 231. The Domus sigil is a pyramid (= symbol for fire and initiation) and timeless. The qliphothic sigil is the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz, with the implication of resurrection, more reflecting an older concept of limited time. In Liber 231, the sigil forTeth in Domarum Mercurii shows the Beast 666 \"under the shadow of the wings\" in two dimensions. It signifies Babalon riding the Beast in union. The sigil for the related Shin shows an initiatory chamber within a pyramid-a parallel of a macrocosm overarching in three dimensions the microcosm, and integrated. Atu XXI is generally titled \"The World.\" Crowley renamed it \"The Universe.\" He retains much ofthe symbolism of the earlier title, though the idea of limitless space is increased in \"The Universe\" card. Atu XXI is traditionally attributed to the Hebrew letter Tau, and Saturn. Each of the two sigils for Tau in Liber 231 underlies the three columns of sigils above. The Domus Mercurii sigil is often interpreted as an expression of lAO. It is singular, possibly implying a unified end. The qliphothic sigil has a turtle (one symbol fo r origins and totem of Set) with the geomantic symbol Acquisitio (obtaining). The middle section is a duplex, cross-wired output. It suggests the uncertainty and repetitive aspects of science. The right hand sections double, one part connected. The duality suggests the contrast between nature and deity, science and religion, open possibilities and fixed answers. The LA-Shin/Tau-AL is then read as 0 (= Not = Origin = Deity)-Space/Time-AL (All= 1 =Totality= Infinity= God). The numerical value of Shin is 300. That ofTau is 400. The total is 700. 300 The Hebrew mother letter Shin (w) represents cosmic Fire. It also implies motion (= time) and energy. It is Ruach Elohim (C'i1r.,N: nn), the spirit of the gods; it is Ye tzer, fo undation or formation (i�'); or the gods, Elohim spelled in full (CO i1' 'i1 10r., �r.,N:). The trinity or triangle applies here. It applies to both the Shin/Teth and Shin/Tau considerations."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"244 THE MYSTERY OF THE UTfERS AND THE TREE OF LIFE 400 The letter Tau (n) represents completion or fulfillment, or matter. The Universe is the complement or fulfillment of God. The Tau is union, the full expression of which is expressed by the hermaphrodite of Atu XXI. Suarez (1973) writes: Tau is the cosmic resistance to the life-breath which animates it. Without this resistance ofTav, life could not come into existence. This resistance to lif e is that which enables life to produce its prodigiously varied manifest forms. The broader, esoteric view does not negate the Shinff'eth interpretation. A Shinff'au interpretation may complement it with its Time/Space, or an JEonic/Universal understanding. 700 Shin/Tau (rliD = 700) are the last two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. They can symbolize end or the beginning. They also mean foundation, depict high and low, good and bad (cf. concept of Horus/Set or ®;1) in Egyptian mythology). The value 700 is 5 x 140 = 5 x 2 x 70. Five repeats the pentagram nature of the ritual. Seventy is the number of A'in, Atu XV, and the Path of the Devil. This path in the lEon of Horus, as seen in the QT, connects Chesed to Hod. Part of the path had been hidden on the GD Tree of life. In the New lEon, Horus/Set occupies the path. Its dual nature, 2 x 70 = 140, fits. The esoteric interpretation also expresses a paradigm shift that parallels the understanding of A' in in the lEon of Horus. Note also that the sigil for the qliphothic A'in in Liber 231 (22) illustrates the \"blind man and emascu­late\" of the related text in Liber 671 vel Pyramidos. Te Velde (1976) interprets Horus/Set as a blind Horus and an emasculate Set combined. The palindrome pattern of knocks for Abrahadabra becomes 4-3-4.

It says:"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"APPENDIX III: THE FORMUUS IN LIBER V VEL REGUU Dividing as 3 and 8 ( 4 + 4), we get 6. of Horus dominating the Stooping Dragon 12(, 11N.
