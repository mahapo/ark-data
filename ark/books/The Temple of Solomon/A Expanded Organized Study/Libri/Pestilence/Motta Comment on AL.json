Chapter IBeing the core of the Equinox Vol. V no. 1by MottaINTRODUCTIONAs all those interested in the A\\ A\\must know, the Order alternates Five Years of Speech with Five Years of Silence.The last published Number of THE EQUINOX was Vol. III, No. vi. Lay bibliophiles must not waste time seekingfor Vol. IV, which was a Volume of Silence.Readers must not, under any circumstances, take this present publication of the Commentaries too seriously. ThePublication is in Classes A, B and C, which means, \"in whiter words\":Class A: These are Utterances from above the Abyss, from Initiates of the Collegium Summum, of which must notbe changed even the style of a letter. Only the original text of AL and The Comment, signed Ankh-f-n-khonsu, are inthis Class here. (Exceptions, such as quotes from other Holy Books, are duly noted.)Such texts are in bold type.(The weak in intellect, the automatic rebel, and even some earnest seeker may ask: \"Why must one not change eventhe style of a letter of such texts?\" The answer is simply that even the style of a letter has meaning in them. It is not amatter of Respect for Authority. It is a matter of keeping the records straight, lest the Utterance of a Master becomesmeared by the Confusion of a Follower, or several Followers, a thing which, unless we mistake, has happened alltoo often in the past.)Class B: These are utterances of High Initiates of the A\\ A\\, or of people recognized as High Initiates by the A\\ A\\,considered of sufficient value to be published under the aegis of the Order.Publications in Class B are recommended for serious study by Brethren and Aspirants. Only the Commentaries byAleister Crowley himself are here in this Class. They are in standard type.(Readers may well ask why even the Utterances of past Magi are, when published under the Imprimatur of the A\\ A\\,classified only up to B. Is it because the A\\ A\\ considers all past Initiates, or Initiates of other Orders, inferior tothose who underwent Its Discipline? Certainly not. Such terms as \"inferior\" or \"superior\" have little or no meaningabove the Abyss. The Utterance of Helena Blavatsky, for instance, although she was Master of the Temple, cannotbe put in Class A, because it was printed by Theosophists, who cannot be trusted to reproduce straight that whichmay offend their prejudices. The Utterance of Dionysus is hopelessly mingled with the ravings, the cries of fear, thesectarian condemnations of unbalanced mystics or all too-balanced politicians who wrote under the collectivepseudonyms of John, Mark, Luke, Matthew, Paul, Peter, etc. The Utterance of Mohammed can never be had in itspurity because, as any scholar knows, he wrote nothing. What we have was written by his followers, purporting tohave been dictated by him. The same is true of Gautama and others. The Utterances of Our Brethren who wereabove the Abyss, when published under the Imprimatur, can be trusted as being reproduced exactly as they wereproduced. That is why they are in Class A. The Utterances of other and friendly Stars which did not come to us intheir pristine purity, these we publish with our warmest commendation, but warning the reader that they may not bewhat those Stars intended. That is why they are in Class B.)Class C: These are writings that the Order considers of sufficient interest to be included in Its Curriculum, but whichare not by High Initiates, or even, sometimes, by Initiates. The Commentaries \"by another\" are here in this Class.They are in italics.Readers may well ask what are \"High Initiates\".

As a rule, writings by such are always in Class B. Writings in Class C maynot always be for study; sometimes they are for recreation, as well. In any case, the fact that they are in Class Cmeans that the Order warns readers that, although It considers such writings useful, they must be suspected ofconfusion, prejudice and error to a much greater degree than writings in Class B.Writings in Class A are not subject to confusion, prejudice or error at all. Whenever they seem to produce confusion,prejudice or error, the fault is the reader's. Such Writings are like mirrors in which each one sees his or her face, andno other.

THE TITLELIBERALvelLEGISsub figuraCCXXas delivered byXCIII = 418toDCLXVITitle:In the first edition, this Book was called L. L is the sacred letter in the Holy Twelvefold Table which forms thetriangle that stabilizes the Universe. See Liber 418. L is the letter of Libra, Balance, and 'Justice' in the Taro. Thistitle should probably be AL, \"El\", as the 'L' was heard of the Voice of Aiwaz, not seen. AL is the true name of theBook, for these letters, and their number 31, form the Master Key to its Mysteries.With regard to the above note by A.C., serious students should consult Liber V vel Reguli, the Ritual of the Mark ofthe Beast, for a more thorough analysis of the Word AL.THE FIRST CHAPTER1. Had! The manifestation of Nuit.The theogony of our Law is entirely scientific: Nuit is Matter, Hadit is Motion, in their full physical sense. They arethe Tao and Teh of Chinese Philosophy; or, to put it very simply, the Noun and Verb in grammar. Our centralTruth?beyond other philosophies?is that these two infinities cannot exist apart. This extensive subject must bestudied in our other writings, notably Berashith, my own Magical Diaries, especially those of 1919, 1920 and 1921,and Liber Aleph, the Book of Wisdom or Folly. See also \"The Soldier and the Hunchback\". Further informationconcerning Nuit and Hadit is given in the course of this Book; but I must here mention that the Brother quoted inconnection with the \"Wizard Amalantrah\", etc. (Samuel bar Aiwaz) identifies them with ANU and ADAD, thesupreme Mother and Father deities of the Sumerians. Taken in connection with the AIWAZ identifications, this isvery striking indeed. (This last sentence was added because A.C. was convinced that Aiwass was the Beingworshipped under this name by the ancient Sumerians.)2. The unveiling of the company of heaven.This verse is to be taken with the next. The 'company of heaven' is Mankind, and its 'unveiling' is the assertion of theindependent godhead of every man and every woman!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Further, as Khabs (see verse 8) is \"Star\", there is a further meaning: this Book is to reveal the Secret Self of a man,i.e., to initiate him. (Or of a woman, and initiate her. As to the meaning of the verses, there are at least four GreatMeanings, one for each of the Four Ordeals mentioned in the Chapter Three, vv. 64-67. Besides these, there aresubsidiary meanings which depend on the Grade of the Commentator, or the Grade of the reader. This is one of thereasons why this matter of commentaries is so difficult, and why any commentary must not be taken too seriously.The Four Great Meanings, of course, are beyond any danger of being confused, since they are experienced inTrance, and independent of Reason. They cannot be communicated through the intellect. Even the most accurateattempt to do so misleads.)3. Every man and every woman is a star.4. Every number is infinite; there is no difference.This is a great and holy mystery. Although each star has its own number, each number is equal and supreme. Everyman and every woman is not only a part of God, but the Ultimate God. \"The Centre is everywhere and thecircumference nowhere.\" The old definition of God takes new meaning for us. Each one of us is the One God. Thiscan only be understood by the initiate; one must acquire certain high states of consciousness to appreciate it. Each'Star' is connected directly with every other star, and the Space being Without Limit (Ain Soph), the Body of Nuit,any one star is as much the Centre as any other. Each man instinctively feels that he is the Centre of the Cosmos, andphilosophers have jeered at his presumption. But it is right. Each simple elemental Self is supreme,Very God of VeryGod. Aye, in this Book is Truth almost insufferably splendid, for Man has veiled himself too long from his ownglory: he fears the abyss, the ageless Absolute. But Truth shall make him free!The reader will assimilate this more easily, on the intellectual plane, by considering the Theory of Relativity. Fromthe point of view of Initiation, the difference between a Magister Templi and a 'Black Brother' is that the Magisterknows that He is the Center of the Universe for himself, but understands that the same is simultaneously true of anyother human being. The 'Black Brother' knows that he is the center of the universe, but does not understand that thesame is true of others. Of all others. What is more, he does not want to understand. He interprets any manifestationof autonomy as an attempt against his authority. The reader must not think that a 'Black Brother' is necessarily a'mean' person. On the contrary, his intentions are usually of the best. He wants your happiness. But since hisdefinition of your happiness is based on what he thinks you should be happy with, he may cause you much harm bytrying to help you. A Magister, as a rule, will not try to help you at all. The Magister is selfish. He minds His ownbusiness, and no other.Frederick Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth had a very amusing tale of a man who approached two 'Black Brethren' andchallenged them. \"What does he say?\" the second 'Black Brother who was somewhat hard of hearing, asked the first.\"He says we are not God,\" the first explained. At once, the second snapped: \"Atheist!\" The utter lack of sense ofhumor is a characteristic of 'Black Brotherhood'. A Magister might have said the same thing ?but with a twinkle.There are certain analogies between 'Black Brotherhood' and paranoia, but while paranoia is a mental disorder,'Black Brotherhood' is of Dadth, and much more dangerous. Religious persecutions, throughout history, werealways the result of a man reaching the threshold of the Abyss through the discipline of a particular faith, and thenfearing to jump. His disease would then affect, telepathically and magically, those of his faith, with results such asHoly Inquisitions, Crusades, and others.5. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men!Here Nuit appeals, simply and directly, recognizing the separate function of each Star of her Body. In addressing meas warrior lord of Thebes, it appears as if She perceived a certain continuity or identity of myself with Ankh-f-n-khonsu, whose Stele is the Link with Antiquity of this Revelation.The unveiling is the Proclamation of the Truth previously explained, that the Body of Nuit occupies Infinite Space,so that every Star thereof is Whole in itself, an independent and absolute Unit. They differ, as Carbon and Calciumdiffer, but each is a simple, \"immortal\" Substance, or at least a form of some simpler Substance. Each soul is thusabsolute, and 'good' or 'evil' are merely terms descriptive of relation between destructible combinations. Thus,Quinine is 'good' for a malarial patient, but 'evil' for the germ of the disease. Heat is 'bad' for ice-cream and 'good' for"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"coffee. The indivisible essence of things, their 'souls', are indifferent to all conditions soever, for none can in anyway affect them.Although this last sentence is grammatically wrong, we left it as written as proof of how hard it is to discuss certainTruths on the plane of the intellect. Aleister Crowley was a Master of the English Language;yet, in trying to expresssomething that transcends Reason, he committed an error of syntax that any modern secretary would avoid! Theproblem was that he was caught in the quandary that the \"indivisible essence\" is simultaneously One and Many!Hence the 'error'Lay readers should understand that when A.C. writes \"here Nuit appeals \"what he actually means is \"Here Aiwass,speaking as Nuit, appeals,\" etc. Aiwass, being an lpsissimus, can of course speak in name of Infinite Space.The fact that Children is with C capital indicates a hidden technical meaning in the verse. Those Children are ratherbig Children! They are Giants, Titans, Gargantuas or Pantagruels of legend?in short, they are Babes of the Abyss.This is the \"Grade\", or rather, the \"Going\" in which the Veil is Rent and the mind receives the first impact of theInfinite. In this sense, therefore, Nuit is appealing to 666 to become the Hierophant of the Greater Mysteries?that isto say, the Magus of the Aeon, the Initiator of the Masters of the Temple. Obviously, He must be in Chokhmah.6. Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue!Aleister Crowley is being 'chosen and the choice is specifically declared: He is to be Hadit, that is, simultaneouslyKether (the centre), Chokhmah (the tongue) and Binah (the ancient Egyptians believed that the heart was the seat ofintelligence).In short, in order to do the job for which he was chosen?Nuit's Helpmeet?he must reach the highest Initiationspossible to man. Which, of course, he did.7. Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar kraat.Aiwass is the name given by Ouarda the Seer as that of the Intelligence communicating. See note to Title. Why isAiwass spelt thus, when Aiwaz is the natural transliteration of ? Perhaps becauseHe was not content with identifying Himself with Thelema, Agape, etc. through the number 93, but wished toexpress His nature by six letters (Six being the number of the Sun, the God- Man, etc.) whose value in Greek shouldbe A = 1, I = 10, F =6, A = 1, S =200,5=200: total 418, the number of Abrahadabra, the Magical Formula of the newAeon! Note that I and V are the letters of the Father and the Son, also of the Virgin and the Bull (see Liber 418),protected on either side by the letter of Air, and followed by the letter of Fire twice over.He declares Himself, in this verse 7, the \"minister of Hoor-paar kraat.\" Hoor-paar-kraat, or Harpocrates, the \"Babe inthe Egg of Blue\", is not merely the God of Silence in the conventional sense. He represents the Higher Self, the HolyGuardian Angel. The connection is with the symbolism of the Dwarf in Mythology. He contains everything inHimself, but is unmanifested. See Chapter Two, verse 8.He is the First Letter of the Alphabet, Aleph, whose number is One, and his card in the Tarot is The Fool, numberedZero. Aleph is attributed to the \"Element\" (in the old classification of things) of Air.Now, as One, or Aleph, he represents the Male Principle, the First Cause, and the free breath of Life, the sound ofthe vowel A being made with the open throat and mouth.As Zero, he represents the Female Principle, the Fertile Mother.(An old name for the card is Mat, from the Italian 'Matto', fool, but earlier also from Maut, the Egyptian Vulture-Mother-Goddess.) Fertile because the 'Egg of Blue' is the Uterus, and in the Macrocosm the Body of Nuit, and it"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"contains the Unborn Babe, helpless, yet protected and nourished against the crocodiles and tigers shown on the card,just as the womb is sealed during gestation. He sits on a lotus, the yoni, which floats on the 'Nile', the amniotic fluid.In his absolute innocence and ignorance he is \"The Fool\"; he is the 'Saviour', being the Son who shall trample on thecrocodiles and tigers, and avenge his father Osiris. Thus we see him as the \"Great Fool\" of Celtic legend, and \"PureFool\" of Act I of Parsifal, and, generally speaking, the insane person whose words have always been taken fororacles.But to be 'Saviour' he must be born and grow to manhood; thus Parsifal acquires the Sacred Lance, emblem ofvirility. He usually wears the 'Coat of many colours' like Joseph the 'dreamer'; so he is also now the Green Man ofspring festivals. But his 'folly' is now not innocence but inspiration of wine: he drinks from the Graal, offered to himby the Priestess.So we see him fully armed as Bacchus Diphues, male and female in one, bearing the Thyrsus-rod, and a cluster ofgrapes or a wineskin, while a tiger leaps up by his side. This form is suggested in the Taro card, where 'The Fool' isshown with a long wand and carrying a sack; his coat is motley. Tigers and crocodiles follow him, thus linking thisimage with that of Harpocrates.Almost identical symbols are those of the secret God of the Templars, the bi-sexual Baphomet, and of ZeusArrhenothelus, equally bi-sexual, the Father-Mother of All in One Person. (He is shown in this full form in the TarotTrump XV, \"The Devil\".) Now, Zeus being lord of Air, we are reminded that Aleph is the letter of Air.As Air, we find the \"Wandering Fool\" pure wanton Breath, yet creative. Wind was supposed of old to impregnatethe Vulture, which therefore was chosen to symbolize the Mother-Goddess.He is the Wandering Knight of Fairy Tales who marries the Kings Daughter. This legend is derived from certaincustoms among exogamic tribes, for which see The Golden Bough.Thus, once Europa, Semele and others claimed that Zeus--Air* [Inserted footnote: * Zeus obtained Air for hiskingdom in the partition with Hades, who took Fire, and Poseidon, who took Water. Shu is the Egyptian God of theFirmament. There is a great difficulty here, etymologically. Zeus is connected with IAO, Abrasax, and the DentalSibilant Gods of the Great Mysteries, with the South and Hadit, Adad, Set, Saturn, Adonai, Attis, Adonis; he is eventhe \"Jesus\", slain with the Lance, whose blood is collected in a Cup. Yet he is also to be identified with the oppositeparty of the North and Nuit, with the \"John\" slain with the Sword, whose flesh is placed upon a Disk, in the LesserMysteries, baptizing with Water as \"Jesus\" with Fire, with On, Qannes, Noah, and the like.It seems as if this great division, which has wrought such appalling havoc upon Earth, was originally no more than adistinction adopted for convenience. It is indeed the task of this Book to reduce Theology to the interplay of theDyad Nuit and Hadit, these being themselves conceived as complementary, as Two equivalent to Naught, \"dividedfor love's sake, for the chance of union.\"]- had enjoyed them in the form of a beast, bird, or what not; while laterMary attributed her condition to the agency of a Spirit?Spiritus, breath, or air?in the shape of a dove. (Simple-mindedreaders must not think for one moment that A. C. is here \"admitting the historical existence of the Virgin Mary\"; onthe contrary, he is obviously putting her on the same footing with Europa, Semele and others. The Virgin Birth, likethe Dying God, is a much older myth than Christianity; and the Virgin was usually seeded by a God under the formof a Beast. Far from being original, Christian Theology is a pot-pourri of stolen goods.)But the \"Small Person\" of Hindu mysticism, the Dwarf insane, yet crafty, of many legends in many lands,is also thissame \"Holy Ghost\", or Silent Self of a man, or his Holy Guardian Angel.He is almost the \"Unconscious\" of Freud, unknown unaccountable, the silent Spirit, blowing \"whither it listeth, butcanst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth\". It commands with absolute authority when it appears at all,despite conscious reason and judgment.Aiwass is then the \"minister\" of this Hoor-paar-kraat, that is, of the Saviour of the World in the larger sense, and ofmine own \"Silent Self' in the lesser. A \"minister\" is one who performs a service, in this case evidently that ofrevealing: Aiwass was the intelligible medium between the Babe God?the New Aeon about to be born?and myself.This Book of the Law is the Voice of the God's Mother, His Father, and Himself. But on appearing, the God assumesthe active form twin to Harpocrates, that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The Concealed Child becomes the Conquering Child,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the armed Horus avenging his father Osiris. So, also, our own Silent Self, helpless and witless, hidden within us, willspring forth, if we have craft to loose him to the Light, spring lustily forward with his Cry of Battle, the Word of ourTrue Wills.This is the Task of the Adept, to have the Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel, to becomeaware of his nature (the Adept's) and his purpose (the Adept's), fulfilling them. (The Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel produce this result. It is not \"the Angel's nature\" or \"the Angel's purpose\" that are to bedone by the Adept! For instance, Aiwass was the Holy Guardian Angel of A.C.; but Aiwass goes on doing His job,that of being minister of Hoor-paar-kraat, while A. C.?now 666? does His. Suum cuique.)8. The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs.Khabs, 'star', or 'Inmost Light', is the original individual, eternal essence in us. The Khu is the magical garmentwhich it weaves for itself, a 'form' for this Being Beyond Form, by use of which it can gain experience through self-consciousness, as explained in the note to verses 2 and 3. The Khu is the first veil, far subtler than mind or body, andtruer; for its symbolic shape depends on the nature of its Star.Why are we told that the Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs? Did we then suppose the converse? I thinkwe are warned against the idea of a Pleroma, a flame of which we are Sparks, and to which we return when we'attain'. That would indeed make the whole curse of separate existence ridiculous, a senseless and inexcusable folly.It would throw us back on the dilemma ofManicheism. The idea of incarnations \"perfecting\" a thing originally perfect by definition is imbecile. The only sanesolution is as given previously, to suppose that the Perfect enjoys experience of (apparent) Imperfection. (There aredeeper resolutions of this problem appropriate to the highest grades of initiation; but the above should suffice theaverage intelligence.)We are not to regard ourselves as base beings, without whose sphere is Light or \"God\". Our minds and bodies areveils of the Light within. The uninitiate is a \"Dark Star \", and the Great Work for him is to make his veils transparentby 'purifying' them. This 'purification' is really 'simplification'; it is not that the veil is dirty, but that the complexityof its folds makes it opaque. The Great Work therefore consists principally in the solution of complexes. Everythingin itself is perfect, but when things are muddled, they become 'evil'. This Doctrine is evidently of supremeimportance, from its position as the first 'revelation' of Aiwass.When A.C. says, above, second paragraph, \"Did we then suppose the converse?\" he is speaking with his tongue inhis cheek. He knows perfectly well that all religions, without one single solitary exception, suppose the converse. He,himself, had once supposed the converse.This central mystery revealed by Aiwass was the darkest secret of most Initiatic Schools. All religions start asMethods of Theurgy; as Met hod degenerates into Routine, Blind Faith becomes more virtuous than Experience, andDogma is born. Then God is put on a pedestal, where He, or She, or It, is less uncomfortably present when youindulge your basest appetites such as Preaching and Saving Souls.The formidable nature of the Book of the Law becomes apparent when we see that this \"Dark Mystery\" is the firstand simplest of its revelations. No wonder organized religions everywhere fought it! No wonder \"Initiatic Orders\"which had only this \"Awful Truth\"? \"Os iris is a Black God\"?to mask their financial and political maneuversclamored that Aleister Crowley was a very wicked man.9. Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you!We are to pay attention to this Inmost Light; then comes the answering Light of Infinite Space. Note that the Light ofSpace is what men call Darkness; its nature is utterly incomprehensible to our uninitiated minds. It is the 'veils'mentioned previously in this comment that obstruct the relation between Nuit and Hadit.We are not to worship the Khu, to fall in love with our Magical Image. To do this?we have all done it?is to forgetour Truth. If we adore Form, it becomes opaque to Being, and may soon prove false to itself. The Khu in each of usincludes the Cosmos as he knows it. To me, even another Khabs is only part of my Khu. Your own Khabs is yourone sole Truth."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"10. Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known.\"My servants\"; not those of the Lord of the Aeon. \"the Law is for all\"; there can be no secrecy about that. The verserefers to specially chosen 'servants'; perhaps those who, worshipping the Khabs, have beheld Her light shed overthem. Such persons indeed consummate the marriage of Nuit and Hadit in themselves; in that case they are aware ofcertain Ways to Power.There is also a mystical sense in this verse. We are to organize our minds thoroughly, appointing few and secretchiefs, serving Nuit, to discipline the varied departments of the conscious thought.11. These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools.This verse establishes uncompromisingly that all Gods?G capital, that is to say, 'true Gods'?and all men deified bylegend or deceit ? that is to say, 'false gods'?are fools. How come? It is a key. Distinction is clearly made betweenthe two types: one are Gods; the other is men. The key is that both types are adored, which, as verses 7-9established, is wrong. Wrong for Aspirants, of course.The 'Gods 'are fools?that is, they reached the Plane of Consciousness of the Fool of the Tarot. The 'men' are alsofools?the common, abundant variety.Technically, an Initiate can be called a God only after crossing the Abyss. However, Masters of the Temple do notbecome known, therefore cannot be adored. It is Those of the Grade following, the Magi, who become known. It isthe Curse of Their Grade that They must speak Truth?so that the Falsehood contained in that Truth may enslave thesouls of men. See Liber I vel Magi. Their Sphere of Consciousness, Chokhmah, receives the Influx from the Crownthrough the Path of Aleph, The Fool.The 'men', in order to become adored, must be sufficiently powerful, magically speaking, to impress theconsciousness of a sufficient number of weaker fools. No hard task for a Magician, but one that only a \"BlackBrother\" would undertake. Now, although both cases result in enslavement, there is a difference in motivation and ineffect. The Magus must speak, though He like it not; the 'Black Brother' ought to shut up (in order to become aMagister Templi), but he will not. The Magus fulfils the Law; the 'Black Brother' rebels against it. The enslavementproduced by the Magus is in harmony with the Racial True Will; it is the kind of 'bondage that leads to freedom' (SeeLiber Aleph, Chapters 36-39). The enslavement produced by the 'Black Brother' invariably leads to stagnation anddeath. If a 'Black Brother' should ever become sufficiently powerful to 'supersede' the Magus of the Aeon in which helives (which fortunately is absurd, although they are always trying), mankind might very well go the way of thedinosaur and other extinct species. Which is not about to happen, by any means. We are at War, certainly, andunder atomic threat, certainly. Better this than the Stagnation that certain well intentioned fools would call 'Peace'!From the point of view of the Aspirant, what is the fundamental difference between the formula of the fools and thatof the Gods? The Gods crossed the Abyss; they are Perfect. See verse 45: \"The Perfect and the Perfect are onePerfect and not two; nay, are none!\" That is, they are the \"Fool of God\"?Zero.With a true God you achieve Samadhi, Union; with a false god, one of the \"fools\" a 'Black Brother' you are enticedor ordered or coerced to pactuate. There is no Union involved, no Spiritual Experience. The pact functions only onthe emotional and intellectual levels, and you give without receiving, since the 'Black Brother' is, deep down, afraidof you. He?or she?will cheat you, and play with you, and brag to you about it?and yet, all the time, you will sensehis or her fear. With a God, fear is all on your side. With a 'Black Brother'; the fear is mutual?and usually his?orhers?is much bigger than yours, since he?or she?knows much better than you do what it is that he or she fears.Therefore, it is written: \"all fools despise!\" A true God needs no adoration, and will not be affected by your scorn. A'Black Brother' will shrivel without one, and foam when faced with the other. (Exceptions to this rule pertain neitherto the Grade for which this commentary is being written, nor to this verse. See Chapter Two, verse 79. See, also,Liber CLXXV.)Aspirants must be on guard, constantly, because the 'Black Brethren' imitate the Magi, and may be mistaken forthem by sloppy thinkers. Because of the confusion of their vehicles, and their spiritual pride, on reaching Samadhiwith a spiritual current the 'Black Brethren' think that they are re-incarnations of the Magus who originated that"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"particular current. They set out to do another man's job, instead of discovering their own Will, and doing it. As aresult, all their words are skew-wise\". But the unwary may spend centuries following a false master?as the RomanChurch, for instance, has proved.12. Come forth,o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love!The whole doctrine of 'love'' is discussed in Liber Aleph and should be studied therein. But note further how thisVerse agrees with the comment above, how every Star is to come forth from its veils, that it may revel with thewhole World of Stars. This is again a call to unite, or 'love', thus formulating the Equation (+1) + (-1) = 0, which isthe general magical formula in our Cosmos. (The Hon. Bertrand Russell might prefer to write this: 1 (-1) = 0. ForInitiates of the IX° of the O.T.O., it could be expressed as:\"TYPE=PICT;ALT=phi.gif(868bytes)\"K - T = 0, where\"TYPE=PICT;ALT=phi.gif(868bytes)\"- K = 0, and\"TYPE=PICT;ALT=phi.gif(868bytes)\"and K are both positive integers.)\"Come forth\" ?from what are you hiding? ?\"under the stars\", that is, openly. Also, let love be 'under' or 'unto' theBody of Nuit. But, above all, be open! What is this shame? Is Love hideous, that men should cover him with lies? IsLove so sacred that others must not intrude? Nay, 'under the stars', at night, what eye but theirs may see? Or, if onesee, should not your worship wake the cloisters of his soul to echo sanctity for that so lovely a deed and gracious youhave done?The above paragraph will sound a little naive to most readers born after the Forties. You must not forget that theCommentaries were written in the Twenties. At that time, if a pair of lovers were merely to embrace and kiss at astreet corner, this would be cause for scandal.Nor should you think that Crowley is necessarily advising you to copulate at midnight in the middle of Main Street.If you do, in most communities you are likely to interrupt or disturb traffic, thereby interfering with the will ofothers. Certain Operations are possible, at least at present, only 'under laboratory conditions'. But to make loveunder a starry sky on a grassy lawn in a public park is not only possible but, at least in this writer's experience,delicious.To watch others 'doing it of course, is not as much fun, but it can be enormously instructive if the others have bettertechnique than you do. If you can swallow your pride and fear and watch attentively, you may become a finerman?or woman-by it.There is, of course, a technical sense in this verse, which varies according to the Grade of the reader. For instance,the numeration of 'love' is 111, which is Aleph, The Fool, and which is also a number of Binah, since its sum is 3.And 'fill' is 76, which sums 13, which is Unity, among other things (ACHD), but also Death in the Tarot. And soforth. Such sub-meanings may mislead, and their perusal or pursuit is better left 'to the right Ingenium of thePracticus'?if to investigate them be his Will."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"13.

The esotericmeaning had better remain secret.15. Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the Beast; and inhis woman called the Scarlet Woman is all power given. They shall gather my children into their fold: theyshall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men.The authority of the Beast rests upon this verse; but it is to be taken in conjunction with certain later verses which Ishall leave to the research of students to interpret.16. For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secret flame, and to her the stoopingstarlight.A. C. \"was inclined to believe\" that \"the Beast\" and \"the Scarlet Woman\" are titles of office rather than persons.Whether this is true or not, speculation as to the secret meaning of this verse may lead to disaster. It is obvious thatit is a temptation for an Aspirant's vanity to fancy himself as \"the next Beast' or herself as \"the Scarlet Woman\".There has been, in the last 65 years, a painful abundance of self- deluded disciples who fancied themselves as such.It must be stated here that either office is neither easy nor pleasing to anyone's Ego, and that those who seriouslyaspire to become \"Beast\" or \"Scarlet Woman\" are more to be laughed at than envied. Robert Heinlein has anamusing story about how the Devil finally managed to dethrone God, and then, upon perceiving the responsibilitiesof Ruler of the Universe, cried in panic, \"But I don't want your job!\" \"So sorry, old boy, now you're stuck with it,\"God replied gleefully, and presumably went vacationing on the Riviera.17. But ye are not so chosen.Those who are chosen for those Offices 'are not'; that is, they passed through the annihilation; they crossed theAbyss. Nor could they perform, unless they crossed. See Liber 156; also, verses 11 and 45 of this Chapter.18. Burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent!In them, Kundalini must have reached the Ajna.19.0 azure-lidded woman, bend upon them!The Eternal Sakhti (Nuit) must activate the Sahashara in them, attracted by the awakening of the Ajna.20.

With the God & the Adorer I am nothing: they do not see me. They are as upon the earth; I am Heaven,and there is no other God than me, and my lord Hadit.Samadhi with any God is not the Ultimate Trance. The Ultimate Trance is the Union of Nuit and Hadit. That is whyover the head of Ra-Hoor-Khuit in the stele, Kundalini has reached the Sahashara, and is radiating into Emptiness.See Liber VII, i, 36-40, Liber HHH, Section SSS, and Liber LXV, iii, 3 1-36.22. Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I will give himwhen at last he knoweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bindnothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing; for therebythere cometh hurt.In A. C. 's case, this secret name of Nuit was BABALON. See Liber 333, Chapter 49, and the Commentary thereof.However, to each Aspirant to Her love She gives a secret name when at last he knows her. See Liber NV, and verse60 of this chapter.Nevertheless, the name given to 666 is of generic importance to all Thelemites, because of His office as Prophet.That name is, therefore, the Seal of the A and Restriction to Choronzon. See Liber 156, and Liber 418, the TenthAethyr.23. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all!Naturally, all Aspirants fancy themselves candidates to this 'exalted office' as well. Let them ponder that the 'chiefmust not care whether he is 'chief, or remains so, or, even, if he is 'obeyed' He must not care even if he is a she! Onlyvenal or naive people hanker for public office.24. I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty.See Liber NV for this. But obviously, N = 50, V = 6.25. Divide, add, multiply, and understand.See Liber NV.26. Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one:Who am I, and what shall be the sign? So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithe body arched for love, and her softfeet not hurting the little flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of thecontinuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.We are, all of us who aspire to Her, bound slaves of Immortal Beauty; it is a pity that our mortal mistresses, notunderstanding Whom we worship in them, so often think that they rule us! Then, when the abuse of their egos finallyforces us to seek a new priestess, they accuse us of being cold and unfeeling, forgetting that the temple must keepitself clean and comely, and worthy of the Presence of the Goddess. The ego is a good servant, but a bad master.That sign, Nuit gives to all those who seek Her, upon their reaching a certain Grade. It is exactly as described.Of course, A.C. 'knew' who he was, since he called himself, and had been first called so by his own mother(!), 666from childhood. See Liber IV. Part IV.27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of herlight bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: 0 Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it beever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou artcontinuous!"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"There are several secret meanings, all of a technical nature, in this passage; it is unnecessary to dwell on them,since they become clear to earnest seekers during training.One thing, however, is better said here, and has to do with the Vampire. At some time during his career, theAspirant will meet a woman who will either insinuate to him, or he will by his own vanity be led to believe, is Nuitincarnate. Now, the key to the ordeal, and its difficulty, is that all women are, in a sense, incarnations of Nuit. ButNO woman is, or can ever be, Nuit in a finite sense. The drop of sea water is of the nature of the ocean, but it is notthe ocean. Nevertheless, one can certainly study some of the characteristics of the ocean in a drop of sea water.Further, as the verse itself states in no uncertain manner, the Heavenly Isis?Nuit?cannot be regarded as anindividual Monad! Nuit above the Abyss does not become One: She is None. The Ordeal being a crucial one, it isbetter that Aspirants be forewarned. Many ships sank against this rock, some of them vessels of great promise. Also,BABALON being merely one of the names of Nuit, what is true of Nuit is true of BABALON.28. None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two.29. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.See the analysis of the Word LAShTAL in Liber V, and the following chapters of Liber Aleph: 119, 121-123, 145-147, 191, 194, 198, 199, 203, for some of the meanings of verses 28-30.31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feel little; what is, is balanced by weakjoys; but ye are my chosen ones.Again we find the expression 'fools of men'. Since not all men are fools, and since we, also, are men, the termobviously has a technical meaning. 'Fools of men' are imperfect initiates, not necessarily 'Black Brothers; butcertainly including these. It is true that the Trance that most often leads Aspirants to the Path is the Trance ofSorrow; but it is necessary to be very hypocritical, or a Buddhist, or both, not to admit that what we seek in the Pathis not 'salvation' for 'others; but our own salvation, meaning, in this case, Sorrow's Ceasing! The followingCommentary by A. C. is illuminating:All this talk about 'suffering humanity' is principally drivel based on the error of transferring one's own psychologyto one's neighbor. It is necessary that we stop, once for all, this ignorant meddling with other people's business. Eachindividual must be left free to follow his own path! America is peculiarly insane on these points. Her people aredesperately anxious to make the Cingalese wear furs, and the Tibetans vote, and the whole world chew gum, utterlydense to the fact that other nations, specially the French and British, regard 'American institutions' as the lowestsavagery, and forgetful or ignorant of the circumstance that the original brand of American freedom?which reallywas Freedom?contained the precept to leave other people severely alone, and thus assured the possibility ofexpansion on his own lines to every man.32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my love willredeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all Ican give, by all I desire of ye all.It is proper to obey The Beast, because His Law is pure Freedom, and He will give no command which is other thana Right Interpretation of this Freedom. But it is necessary, for the development of Freedom itself, to have anorganization; and every organization must have a highly-centralized control. This is specially necessary in time ofwar, as even the so-called 'democratic' nations have been taught by Experience, since they would not learn fromGermany. Now, this age is pre-eminently a 'time of war', most of all now, when it is our Work to overthrow theslave-gods.The above reference to Germany is to the Germany of the First World War.As for the 'organization' referred to, there is the inherent difficulty that Thelemites abhor blind obedience just asmuch as they abhor automatic insubordination. Consequently, a Thelemic organization cannot be said to exist. The"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"0. T. 0., after several false starts, is dormant; the Order of Thelema at present has one single member; the A.'. A.'. ,by the very nature of its Method, cannot be said to be an 'organization' in the usual sense of the word. Nevertheless,it is the most efficient of the three!For an 'organization' to appear, it would be necessary that a sufficient number of highly intelligent, wilful andresourceful individuals resolved, spontaneously and simultaneously, to obey. Only the A .A .. has been successful inthis up to now. Organizations below the Abyss have in themselves the seed of their own destruction, and up to nowthis Will-to-Die has prevailed. That is as it should be: \"who am I, that I should save this People?\"The injunction \"seek me only\" is emphasized with an oath, and a special promise is made in connection with it. Byseeking lesser ideals one makes distinctions, thereby affirming implicitly the very duality from which one is seekingto escape. Note also that \"me\" may imply the Greek MH ,\"not\". The word 'only' may be taken as ONLV, Ayin, Nun,Lamed, Vau, with the number of 156, that of the Secret Name BABALON of Nuit. There are presumably furtherhidden meanings in the key-word 'all'.The reader is here referred to our previous warning on the matter of the Vampire of this Ordeal (Commentary initalics to verse 27). If you seek Her only, you cannot confuse any one of Her manifestations with Her. On the otherhand, as long as a particular priestess shows Her to you, concentrate! See Liber Artemis Iota and Liber A'ash forfurther information on this very difficult point.Nor should Aspirants fall into the mistake of believing that it is their duty to aspire to Her. Their duty is to do theirWill, and nothing else. If it is thy Will to seek Her, do so. If it isn't, do thy will. The Grades are Three, and 'they alsoserve who stand and wait'.Besides, She is everywhere!...33. Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the Queen of Heaven; Write unto us theordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us the law!Law, in the common sense of the word, should be a formulation of the customs of a people, as Euclid's propositionsare the formulation of geometrical facts. But modern knavery conceived the idea of artificial law, as if one should tryto square the circle by tyranny. Legislators try to force the people to change their customs so that the \"business men\"whose greed they are bribed to serve may increase their profits.A.C. is being unduly harsh in his judgment of the motivations of lawmakers in capitalistic countries; but at the timeof writing, Russia had embarked on the road to revolution, and the sublime optimist had hopes of seeing a Thelemicsociety emerge. In point office, Russia was to become even more bourgeois than the bourgeoisie, which happensevery time people who consider themselves inferior have an opportunity to emulate those whom they consider,openly or secretly, their betters.The main enemy of the commonweal, in any type of society, is neither personal greed nor personal ambition, butgeneral stupidity and inertia. Evolution of the human animal has just started; the 'beastie' is less than a few hundredthousand years old, and has barely learned to use one fifth of its new toy, the brain. You must expect error andinefficiency at every corner, and the attitude of the Adept towards his ?fellows??must be that of a patient, wary andhumorous keeper in an asylum. If he loses his patience, he will kill the inmates; if he stops watching, they will killhim; and if he loses his sense of humor, that is to say, his sense of perspective, he will go insane himself.Whenever you grow fed up with the whole setup, as you no doubt will, it may help you to consider that Humanitydoes, after all, progress. The Promulgation of the Law of Thelema, and Its conscious or unconscious adoption by theleading minds of the planet, would have been impossible at any other known historical period. Men have whispered'Do what thou wilt' in the past at other men's ear; but they either chose carefully to whom they whispered, orpretended they spoke in jest.'Law' in Greek is NOMOC,from NEM, and means strictly \"anything assigned, that which one has in use orpossession\"; hence \"custom, usage\", and also \"a musical strain\". The literal equivalence of NEM and the LatinNEMO is suggestive (Let etymologists keep their temper; this is a hint directed not at them, but at Babes of theAbyss.) In Hebrew, 'Law' is THORA, and equivalent (that is, qabalistically) to words meaning \"The Gate of the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Kingdom\" and \"The Book of Wisdom\". (Heed well, 0 Children!)34. But she said: the ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the Law is for all.The Ordeals are at present carried out unknown to the Candidate by the secret Magick Power of The Beast. Thosewho are accepted by Him for initiation testify that these Ordeals are frequently independent of His conscious care.They are not, like the traditional ordeals, formal, or identical for all; the Candidate finds himself in circumstanceswhich afford a real test of conduct, and compel him to discover his own nature, to become aware of himself bybringing his secret motives to the surface.Some of the Rituals have been made accessible, that is, the Magical Formulae have been published. See \"The Ritesof Eleusis,\" \"Energized Enthusiasm,\" Book 4, Part III, etc.Note the reference to 'not' and 'all'. Also, the word 'known' contains the root GN, 'to beget' and 'to know'; while'concealed' indicates the other half of the Human Mystery.The 'other half of the Human Mystery is, of course, Woman.Aspirants must not fret because the rituals are 'half concealed'. Those who practice seriously attract the Attention ofthe Hierophant and the High Priestess, and what is concealed springs forth within them at the time it is needed.Also, this 'hidden half may vary according to individual idiosyncrasy. If any rituals had been 'completely' and'openly' given, we would have Dogma, and no doubt a 'Church of Thelema complete with pope or popess orwhatnot, by now. This ain't at all what the doctor ordered, chillun.35. This that thou writest is the threefold book of Law.Readers will please note that it is threefold; therefore, if statements in any one chapter seem to contradict statementsin another chapter (or even within the same chapter), contradiction is apparent, and there is a hidden key. Unlessthis continuity of the Law within the chapters, and from a chapter to another chapter, is kept in mind, Aspirants willfall into a quantity of pitfalls that have been provided by the Author ?Aiwass?to winnow out the chaff36.

This definition includes raising the dead, bewitchingcattle, making rain, acquiring goods, fascinating judges, and all the rest of the programme. Good: but it also includesevery act soever? Yes; I meant it to do so. It is not possible to utter word or do deed without producing the exacteffect proper and necessary thereto. Thus Magick is the Art of Life itself.Magick is the management of all we say and do, so that the effect is to change that part of our environment whichdissatisfies us, until it does so no longer. We \"remould it nearer to the heart's desire\".Magick ceremonies proper are merely organized and concentrated attempts to impose our Will on certain parts of theCosmos. They are only particular cases of the general law.But all we say and do, however casually, adds up to more, far more, than our most strenuous Operations. \"Take careof the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves.\" Your daily drippings fill a bigger bucket than yourgeysers of magical effort. The \"ninety and nine that safely lay in the shelter of the fold\" have no organized will at all;and their character, built of their words and deeds, is only a garbage-heap.Remember, also, that, unless you know what your true will is, you may be devoting the most laudable energies todestroying yourself. Remember that every word and deed is a witness to thought, that therefore your mind must beperfectly organized, its sole duty to interpret circumstances in terms of the Will so that speech and action may berightly directed to express the Will appropriately to the occasion. Remember that every word and deed which is not adefinite expression of your Will counts against it, indifference worse than hostility. Your enemy is at least interestedin you: you may make him your friend as you never can do with a neutral. Remember that Magick is the Art of Life,therefore of causing change in accordance with Will; therefore its law is \"love under will\", and its every movementis an act of love.Remember that every act of \"love under will\" is lawful as such; but that when any act is not directed unto Nuit, whois here the inevitable result of the whole Work, that act is waste, and breeds conflict within you, so that \"thekingdom of God which is within you\" is torn by civil war. To the beginner I would offer this programme:1. Furnish your mind as completely as possible with the knowledge of how to inspect and to control it.2. Train your body to obey your mind, and not to distract its attention.3. Control your mind to devote itself wholly to discover your true Will.4. Explore the course of that Will till you reach its source, your Silent Self.5. Unite the conscious will with the true Will, and the conscious Ego with the Silent Self. You must be utterlyruthless in discarding any atom of consciousness which is hostile or neutral.6. Let this work freely from within, but heed not your environment, lest you make difference between one thing andanother. Whatever it be, it is to be made one with you by Love.

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.The man of Earth, the Lover and the Hermit are the three types of Thelemites. The man of Earth is \"the adherent\";the Lover 'gives his life unto the Work among men'; the Hermit 'goes solitary, and gives only of his light unto men'.(See Liber 418.)The enumeration of the Three Grades, followed by the injunction Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,means that no discrimination of \"superiority\" or \"inferiority\" is to be made between the Three Grades. It is a matterof the Will, and nothing else, that decides to which Grade a Thelemite is to belong. In a sense, the man of Earth 'isthe adherent', that is, he is loyal to Thelema, adheres to it. In another sense, he adheres to the material world. He isthe husbandman, the householder, the man attached to temporal things. To despise such a man is stupid. He is aKarma Yogi by definition, and who are you to trace another star's orbit?The Lover is a Bhakhti Yogi. He abandons temporal interests and dedicates his life to service of the Order. He willkill himself, if need be, that the Order may live. Such men organize Thelemic movements, thereby incurring the riskof persecution on the part of Old Aeon organizations and the 'Black Lodge'?a better name for such organizations,and particularly for the 'Black Lodge; is 'the die hards.'The Hermit is a Gnani orRaja Yogi. He gives only of his light unto men. Those who understand what this means areeither Hermits or on their way to become Hermits. Those who do not understand what it means are better off withoutfurther information. Should they seek it, however, let them study Libri 156, 370 and 418.41. The word of Sin is Restriction. 0 man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! 0 lover, if thou wilt, depart! There isno bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed! Accursed be it to the aeons! Hell.The first paragraph is a general statement or definition of Sin or Error. Anything soever that binds the will, hindersit, or diverts it, is Sin. That is, Sin is the appearance of the Dyad. Sin is impurity.* [Inserted footnote: * One cannotsay that it was \"Sin\" for Naught to restrict itself within the form of Two; on the contrary. But sin is to resist theoperation of the reversion to Naught. 'The wages of Sin is Death\"; for Life is a continual harmonious and naturalChange. See Liber 418 and Liber Aleph.Sin (see Skeat's Etymological Dictionary) is connected with root \"es\", to be. This throws a new light on the passage.Sin is restriction, that is, it is 'being' as opposed to 'becoming'. The fundamental idea of wrong is the static asopposed to the dynamic conception of the Universe. This explanation is not only in harmony with the generalteaching of the Book of the Law, but shows how profoundly the author understands Himself.]The remainder of the paragraph takes a particular case as an example. There shall be no property in human flesh. Thesex- instinct is one of the most deeply-seated expressions of the will; and it must not be restricted, either negativelyby preventing its free function, or positively by insisting on its false function.What is more brutal than to stunt natural growth or to deform it? What is more absurd than to seek to interpret this holy instinct as a gross animal act, to separate it from the spiritualenthusiasm without which it is so stupid as not even to be satisfactory to the persons concerned?The sexual act is a sacrament of Will. To profane it is the great offence. All true expression of it is lawful; allsuppression or distortion is contrary to the Law of Liberty. To use legal or financial constraint to compel eitherabstention or submission, is entirely horrible, unnatural and absurd. Physical constraint, up to a certain point, is notseriously wrong; for it has its roots in the original sex- conflict which we see in animals, and has often the effect ofexciting Love in his highest and noblest shape. Some of the most passionate and permanent attachments have begunwith rape. Rome was actually founded thereon. Similarly, murder of a faithless partner is ethically excusable, in acertain sense; for there may be some stars whose Nature is extreme violence. The collision of galaxies is amagnificent spectacle, after all. But there is nothing inspiring in a visit to one's lawyer.

Now, the Machine of Matter-Motion is an explosive machine, with pyrotechniceffects; but these are only incidentals.Laws against adultery are based upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is todeprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, everywoman is a star. She has therefore an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should notbe the ideal hausfrau, if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, forpractical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife wasnothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman iseconomically independent, becomes more so every year.

Readers must not forget that this amazingly modern Commentary waswritten in the Twenties.) has seen this emancipation flower in four years. Primitive people, the Australian troups forexample, are saying that they will not marry English girls, because English girls like a dozen men a week. Well, whowants them to marry? Russia has already formally abrogated marriage. Germany and France have tried to 'save theirfaces' in a thoroughly Chinese manner, by marrying pregnant spinsters to dead soldiers!England has been too deeply hypocritical, of course, to do more than \"hush things up\"; and is pretending 'business asusual', though every pulpit is aquake with the clamour of bat-eyed bishops, squeaking of the awful immorality ofeverybody but themselves and their choristers. English women over 30 have the vote; when the young'uns get it,good-bye to the old marriage system.America has made marriage a farce by the multiplication and confusion of the Divorce Laws. A friend of mine whohad divorced her husband was actually, three years later, sued by him for divorce!!!But America never waits for laws; her people go ahead. The emancipated, self-supporting, American woman alreadyacts exactly like the 'bachelor-boy'. Sometimes she loses her head, and stumbles into marriage, and stubs her toe. Shewill soon get tired of the folly. She will perceive how imbecile it is to ham-string herself in order to please herparents, or to legitimatize her children, or to silence her neighbours.She will take the men she wants as simply as she buys a newspaper; and if she doesn't like the Editorials, or theComic Supplement, it's only two cents gone, and she can get another.Blind asses! who pretend that women are naturally chaste! The Easterns know better; all the restrictions of theharem, of public opinion, and so on, are based upon the recognition of the fact that woman is only chaste when thereis nobody around. She will snatch the babe from its cradle, or drag the dog from its kennel, to prove the old saying:Natura abhorrent a vacuum. For she is the Image of the Soul of Nature, the Great Mother, the Great Whore.It is to be well-noted that the Great Women of History have exercised unbounded freedom in Love, Sappho,Semiramis, Messalina, Cleopatra, Ta Chhi, Pasiphae, Clytaemnaestra, Helen of Troy, and in more recent times Joanof Arc (by Shakespeare's account), Catherine II of Russia, Queen Elizabeth of England (He means, of course, theGreat Elizabeth?the First.), George Sand. Against these we can put only Emily Bronte, whose sex-suppression wasdue to her environment, and so burst out in the incredible violence of her art, and the regular religious mystics, SaintCatherine, Saint Teresa, and so on, the facts of whose sex-life have been carefully camouflaged in the interests of theslave-gods. But, even on that showing, the sex-life was intense, for the writings of such women are overloaded withsexual expression passionate and perverted, even to morbidity and actual hallucination.Sex is the main expression of the Nature of a person; great Natures are sexually strong; and the health of any personwill depend upon the freedom of that function.See Liber CI, \"De Lege Libellum\", Cap.

The crescent moon was his symbol. This conception is totally hostile to ours. To us, the Moon is a femininesymbol. Further, our Hermit of the Tarot is solar, not lunar. ' Sin' is essentially homosexual. His word is Restrictionbecause his nature is twisted.Perhaps because of Hebrew enslavement by the Babylonians, Jehovah acquired several of the markedly homosexualcharacteristics of Sin. The God of the Jews is a homosexual's concept of maleness:Harsh, violent, revengeful, merciless. There are no equilibrating qualities. It is Geburah at its worst. It must come asa surprise to those who do not know their Qabalah that this image of the Male is incomplete. As a matter of fact,Geburah is Female. It is Chesed?Mercy?which is Male. The qualities that homosexuals attribute to masculinity arenothing but psychological transference. Women, who are much more qualified to judge, like men to be gentle andconsiderate. They want men to be strong, and hard, and even harsh, of course-but they want to feel an underlyingbasis of qualities which homosexuals are inclined to attribute to the female.In Jewish Theology there is no Woman Concept. The Creator is 'all boy; and one must surmise that He produced theUniverse through some astounding feat of male parthenogenesis. These homosexual tendencies reflect themselves inthe harsh intolerance of Mosaic law towards women. Wives ARE chattels. Women are not admitted to worship.Adulteresses are stoned to death.These 'super-male' (Sin is nothing of the sort, of course; he is an 'under-male') traits are not exclusive to Judaism.One finds them in all religions that associate the concept of spiritual purity with sexual abstinence. Sexualabstinence is 'good 'only in the athletic sense. And some biological types experience no good effects from it. Someathletes copulate more during and after an athletic event than normally, and perform just as well or better for it.This is a matter to be decided strictly by personal judgment. To establish sexual abstinence as a religious rule forall, indiscriminately, is insensate. \"Yet there are those who have dared and achieved thereby\" (see Liber 175).Certainly: but others have achieved without it, and anyway, once you achieve, why not outgrow the old toys and goon to other things?We take Judaism as an example only because the sexual morality preached in the West is essentially Old Testamentstuff It is useless that Christians should pretend they are Christians when they persist in interpreting their 'Jesus' inthe same terms that orthodox Jews ascribe to a 'good 'Rabbi! Were we to believe for one moment that the Gospelsare the biography of an actual, historical, person, we would have to remember that 'Jesus' was hated by the Jewishpriesthood, and was tortured to death through the efforts of the High Priest. 'Jesus' was described as a drunkard, afriend of sinners and a Roman sympathizer. He kept none of the Mosaic regulations. Indeed, he went so far as tosuggest that Mosaic law had been created for man, and not otherwise! That he seems to have appreciatedwhores?and vice-versa?is repeatedly pointed out. Historical or not, the intention was obviously to introduce a morehumane?we shall go further, and say human?note in Jewish mores. It is deplorable that the attempt took fifteenhundred years to succeed, and did so thanks not to priests and theologians, but to freethinkers and scientists. Orperhaps it is not deplorable at all.To men educated in societies influenced by Sin morals, a wife is a piece of property. 'Adultery' can be punished bymurder of the 'unfaithful' spouse. One must remark that this cuts both ways. Women of such societies are jealous andpetty and unforgiving. What is more, the dichotomy of their mores necessarily is reflected in their personalities.They are often shockingly promiscuous behind their husband's backs, but they condemn themselves for it. At thesame time, they hate and fear women who are openly independent. They are whores that stick-or pretend to stick?toone customer. Sexually, they delight in dirty affinities. At the same time, they are prim and prude. Frankness shocksthem?they equate it with grossness. Yet, you can get them to perform in the grossest manner in sex. Such women liketo be humiliated. They despise themselves and hunger for debasement. Men who service them to their satisfactionare usually latent homosexuals who fear the opposite sex, and want to strike out against what they fear. Such womenare usually indifferent housekeepers and never rise far in the professions, being lazy by temperament, stupid orindisciplined in the intellect, and in conflict with their own true wills."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Paradoxical though it may seem, Sin mores disapprove violently of sexual deviations. Sin men hate homosexuals andfeel compelled to beat them or insult them. This excessive reaction of hostility is a defense mechanism. They feelattracted, therefore they fear. A society that is sexually equilibrated will tolerate exceptions. A society that issexually unhealthy will not, because its balance is unstable, and it is easily upset by deviations.One must add that the above remarks are just as true of societies where the concept of the Female exists without theMale.While it is true that everybody has absolute right to interpret the external-or the internal?Universe as they please,an interpretation that is too partial or twisted leads inevitably to interference with the will of others. Thelemites willfind themselves hampered at every turn by people whose concept of God is homosexual. They will try to restrict yourpersonal freedom to serve their perverted moral values. You will find that the idea that sex can be a form of spiritualexpression repels them strongly. Sin societies admit and tolerate the most debasing debauch, but they do not toleratephallicism. They understand a sexual orgy, but not a sexual Mass. Sex, for them, is connected with the concept ofOriginal Sin, and this is what necessitates?for them?the existence of a Sacrament of Marriage. The purpose of theSacrament is to impart holiness to something that is holy in itself This is because the sex act shakes the very roots ofthe tree of the Ego, and the Ego that does not have its roots deep and firm in the dark ground of the Racial Streamfears the shaking. It is true that an unstable personality can go temporarily insane as a result of the sex act,particularly if the sex act is of a type that it subconsciously desires but consciously fears. But such insanity is the\"Change that is the Rottenness of Choronzon\" (See Liber Aleph, Chapter 105), and eventually the Personalityreorganizes itself along lines more healthily adjusted to Life and Nature, provided no fool (of men!) interferes withthe process.The injunctions '0 man!' and '0 lover', etc., refer technically to certain ordeals proper to the Grades of man of Earthand Lover, besides the general meaning given in A. C. 's Commentary.42. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will.\"Manyhood bound and loathing\". An organized state is a free association for the common weal. My personal Will tocross the Atlantic, for example, is made effective by cooperation with others on agreed terms. But the forcedassociation of slaves is another thing.A man who is not doing his will is like a man with cancer, an independent growth in him, yet one from which hecannot get free. The idea of self-sacrifice is a moral cancer in exactly this sense.Similarly, one may say that not to do one's will is evidence of mental or moral insanity. When \"duty points one way,and inclination the other\", it is proof that you are not one, but two. You have not centralized your control. Thisdichotomy is the beginning of conflict, which may result in a Jekyll-Hyde effect. Stevenson suggests that man maybe discovered to be a \"mere polity\" of many individuals. The sages knew it long since. But the name of this polity isChoronzon, mob rule, unless every individual is absolutely disciplined to serve his own, and the common, purposewithout friction.It is of course better to expel or destroy an irreconcilable. \"If thine eye offend thee, cut it out\". The error in theinterpretation of this doctrine has been that it has not been taken exactly as it stands. It has been read thus: \"If thineeye offend some standard of right or wrong imposed on society in general, or on you, by another, cut thine eye out.\"The curse of society has been Procrustean morality, the ethics of the herd-men. One would have thought that a mereglance at Nature would have sufficed to disclose Her scheme of Individuality made possible by Order. (That mostliving things live from other living things is no objection. See Liber 418 for the Curse that turns into a Blessing, theCall of the Aethyrs.)A subsidiary meaning of the verse is that you should not attack directly or indiscriminately social states that areunhealthily organized. You should do your will, and tackle only obstacles that present themselves in the path of yourwill.But others are suffering under bondage!?I hear a fool say. If so, the freedom that you granted them would be justanother kind of bondage. The slaves shall serve, no matter what the social system may be. Only those who gain"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"freedom for themselves are free, because freedom must be a spiritual state INSIDE you before its effects begin tomanifest in your environment. Russia made a revolution to free herself from the control of a minority. It is still undercontrol of a minority?the spiritual descendants of the minority who made the revolution: the Communist Party. Themass of the people are still slaves, like the mass of the people in any other country. The general standard of livinghas improved, but it is debatable whether it would not have improved faster, with less sacrifice, through socialevolution rather than revolution, the way it happened in America and Britain.We Thelemites are neither revolutionaries nor proselytisers. We do not aim to change the world, we aim to changeourselves. That is how we leaven our environment. It is by learning to know our True Will, and doing it, that webring fresh fire into the world. No man can do his fellows greater benefit than to offer them an example of personalfreedom.43. Do that, and no other shall say nay.The general meaning of this verse is that so great is the power of asserting one's right that it will not long bedisputed. For by doing so one appeals to the Law. In practice, it is found that people who are ready to fight for theirrights are respected, and let alone. The slave-spirit invites oppression.The above comment by A.C. is generally true, but there are particulars. There are Stars and stars. Each has its path;that path may go strange ways. Those whose Will is difficult, or likely to affect their fellow men more than others,may expect hardship in proportion to the Weight and Scope of their purpose in life. Witness His own life!44. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.The best commentary to this verse is to be found in Liber II, The Message of the Master Therion.This verse is best interpreted by defining 'pure will' as the true expression of the Nature, the proper or inherentmotion of the matter, concerned. It is unnatural to aim at any goal. The student is referred to Liber LXV, ii, 24, andto the Tao Teh King. This becomes particularly important in high grades. One is not to do Yoga, etc., in order to getSamadhi, like a school-boy or a shopkeeper; but for its own sake, like an artist.\"Unassuaged\" means \"its edge taken off by\" or \"dulled by\". The pure student does not think of the result of theexamination.45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!Serious students are referred to our note to verse 11. The Perfect is Zero, and no matter how many times you addZero to Zero, you always get Zero.There is a technical meaning to this verse which is of the utmost importance to Zelators. The Grade of Zelatorreflects that of Magister Templi in the Lower Triad?see Liber 418 on Jesod?and the Zelator becomes acquaintedwith that influence which we call Choronzon?333.Without speculating on the nature of this \"mighty Devil\" which has power to persecute any member of the A .' . A . '.as long \"as thou art thou\"?see Liber 418, the Tenth Aethyr?we may say simply that the Aspirant will be approachedby all kinds of people who will talk as if inspired, or talk as if they are Masters, and who will attempt to advise or towarn him, or just to make contact with him and be acknowledged as Gods speaking.Pay no attention to them. They are simply Choronzon, one and all.True \"Gods\" are Perfect, and will not speak to you. They and you have different True Wills. They do not considerthemselves competent to advise a fellow Star. Only your Holy Guardian Angel can do it. And the Angel speakswithin you. He is not you?and He never pretends to be! But He speaks within you.All \"messages\" from Choronzon have as their sole purpose to test your understanding of the Law of Thelema, andfidelity thereunto.This is a very difficult note to understand, unless you have some Initiatic Experience. You must be at least a"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Neophyte to get something from it. For the Central Experience of the Grade is the Vision of the Holy GuardianAngel, and that Vision, although it is not to be confused with the Knowledge and Conversation obtaining inTiphereth of Tiphereth, imparts your first inkling of Spiritual Perspective.Although this is not to the point, we might as well add a further warning: Neophytes must guard themselves againstthe tendency to confuse the Vision with the Knowledge and Conversation, that is, to think themselves Adepts Within,and Zelators must keep in mind that they are not Masters of the Temple!If they were Masters of the Temple, Choronzon would no longer speak to them. For He who is a Magister Templi isno longer he. See Liber Aleph, Chapters 1 64-1 65.There is a 'Siddha' in Yoga, described by Patanjali, which consists of the ability to penetrate another's mind, \"andassume control thereof'. This 'power' is often employed by 'Black Brothers', specially if the other mind belongs toone of the sick currents started by themselves. In such a case, the cakkrams of the owner of that mind are attuned tothe influence of the 'Black Brother and his or her astral is 'in sympathy' with the 'Black Brother' influence.This unworthy 'power' is never used by true Gods. The Perfect crossed the Abyss: He is defined as being at least aMaster of the Temple. True Initiates NEVER interfere with another human's will. However, They are in communionwith ALL human wills in a manner incomprehensible by, and inexplicable to, the profane. Even the highest types ofSamadhi give only a pale idea of this communion. It is the true and genuine Communion of the Saints, and the Grail,the Cup in the hand of our Lady BABALON, is its symbol. Readers are referred to Liber LXV, Chapter i, vv. 3, 18,63; Chapter ii, vv. 4-6, 26, 28-29, 43; Chapter iii, vv. 17-20, 4 7-48, 61, 65; Chapter iv, vv. 47,51, 60; Chapter v, vv.1, 15-18, 22-24, 59-64. See also Liber VII, Chapter vii, vv. 41-52; Liber I, and Liber 156.46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call it eight, eighty, four hundred &eighteen.The Jews call it AIN, 61, Not. They are aware of the Key, but their awareness is unbalanced. They arrive to it onlythrough mysticism or Qabalistic metaphysics, and their Spiritual Experience is insufficient. It leads them to considerthemselves the \"Chosen People\", with the result that Hebrew initiates often behave like spoiled children, interferingwith the work of Initiates higher than themselves. Then, just like children, having cast breezes, they complain whenthey harvest storms.Aiwass calls the key eight, eighty, four-hundred and eighteen. These three numbers give a balanced process ofTraining which includes both Magick and Mysticism. As a result, the Initiate acquires sufficient Spiritual Experiencenot to make the same blunders as do \"asses in lion skin\".47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.They have half of the key. HALF=5+1+30+ 6=42. 4+2=6, the Sun. The Jews have, in common with Thelemites,awareness of the Sun Current. This they acquired through the Egyptian Initiate they called Moses and \"adopted\" asa Jew. It is with motive that they have been called \"Children of Satan\". Truly, the \"Eye that watches over Israelnever sleeps\". But that Eye watches over everybody!unite by thine art so that all disappear'. This phrase sent certain debased elements within Jewish Occultism huntingfor Aleister Crowley as long as he lived. Thelemites have been pointed (by these same so-called occultists) as theoriginators of the Nazi party. The fact that the Nazis destroyed all copies of the Book of the Law in Germany, andseized all translations of A. C.'s works, and put the Outer Head of the 0. T. 0. (who, incidentally, was married to aJewess) in a concentration camp is not mentioned. Equally, these people seem not to realize that the Nazis treatedthem exactly as the Jews treated the \"heathen\" in the Old Testament. Hitler was a personification of all of Jehovah'sattributes?only, this time, turned against \"His People\".. .Even the concept of the superiority of the Aryan race' andthe inferiority of the 'Semites' mirrors the ineffable presumption of the People Elect and its attitude towards itsfellowmen.All Karma has to be paid, and the Jews paid theirs. As compensation, through two thousand years of persecutionthey had to sharpen their wits until today they compose one of the most intelligent and efficient cultural groups onthe surface of the planet. If the Nazis had been half as intelligent, they would have married Jewish women and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"sterilized only the men. Germany might have won the war, then. But the Nazis were stupid. They were as stupid asOld Testament Jews.When a book is the only book that by chance is preserved and by design transmitted throughout fifteen centuries, itmay well become The Book. The Bible is one of the most brutish, most cruel, most fanatic cultural records extant. Itsreligious fables are either naive or fatuous. It has neither the loftiness of the Pyramid Texts nor the humancompassion of the Sumerian. ft has neither the subtlety of the Chinese classics nor the psychological depth of theHindu. But it was the only book the West knew for centuries?and look at the record of the West during thosecenturies!Indeed, \"unite by thine art so that all disappear\". Unite?not destroy. Unite together under the banner of anenlightened humanity, free of all the ignorant idiocy of national, cultural or religious prejudice; free to experiencethe grandeur of our true identity as radiant Stars within the Body of Our Lady Nuit. Any self-concept that falls shortof this is utterly fallacious.48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and none by the Book?Crowley, who knew the attributions of AIN, and its mystical meaning, had become troubled since the dictation ofverse 45. \"But are not the Perfect, all of them, just One?\" he kept asking mentally as dictation went on. FinallyAiwass incorporates his doubt in the Text, answering it out loud, and speaking for the Goddess.The key is, of course, that Monotheism is a lie. Belief in the Oneness of Man is a great comfort to the Ego. \"I am theOne!\" cries every 'Black Brother'. The Master of the Temple answers not, for He is Not.The Ox?Aleph is the Ox, of course, 1 by the Qabalah and Zero by the Book of Thoth, the Taro. Also, Aleph infull?ALP?is 111, \"one, one, one\". It is also indicative that the two letters of OX in English suggest the Cross and theCircle.49. Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in the East atthe Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be theadorant, Isa the Sufferer; Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating.This verse declares that the old formula of Magick?the Osiris-Adonis-Jesus-Marsyas-Dionysus- Attis-Etc. formulaof the Dying God?is no longer efficacious. (It never was efficacious; it was merely the least deficient formulapossible in the Aeon of Pisces just past.) It rested on the ignorant belief that the Sun died every day, and every year,and that its resurrection was a miracle.The Formula of the New Aeon recognizes Horus, the Child crowned and conquering, as God. We are all members ofthe Body of God, the Sun; and about our System is the Ocean of Space. This formula is then to be based upon thesefacts. Our \"Evil\", \"Error\", \"Darkness\", \"Illusion\", whatever one chooses to call it, is simply a phenomenon ofaccidental and temporary separateness. If you are \"walking in darkness\", do not try to make the sun rise by self-sacrifice, but wait in confidence for the dawn, and enjoy the pleasures of the night meanwhile.The general allusion is to the Equinox Ritual of the G.'. D.'., where the officer of the previous six months,representing Horus, took the place of the retiring Hierophant, who had represented Osiris.The \"general allusion\" is nothing of the sort. This verse is a categorical statement, to be taken in the most objectiveway by any Aspirant to Initiation. All the rituals, words and signs of past Initiatic Orders are abrogate. You must not1 et yourself be conned by any of them. See \"The Ship\".Asar and Isa are one, that is, they are different forms of the same formula, the Central Formula of the MinorMysteries. The difference between their rites is simply a matter of psychological convenience. See Liber 175, verse2, for this important point.\"Let Asar be the adorant\". In our System, the Candidate presents himself before Horus, to invoke Him, under theparaphernalia of Asar. If the Candidate is wise, he will make sure that he possesses the magical and mysticalpowers of which the paraphernalia are merely the symbols. For Ra-Hoor-Khuit demands that you bind the Words"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"and the Deeds.\"Isa the sufferer\". This expression needs no explanation if you have any acquaintance with the sado-masochisticnature of Christian mysticism, specially where Roman Catholicism predominates. Some people are happy only whenthey suffer. Let them be. See LXV, v, verses 7-10, 19-22, 47-51. Who are you to chart another star's course?\"But they are not of me.\" In one sense, this means that those who identify themselves with either Asar or Isa canbecome \"stars of Her body\" only by death?be this death Initiatic or physical. In another sense, it means that they areof Her all the time, since in truth they are not. But as long as your Sahashara is not active, for you She does \"not\"exist.Isa is the legendary \"Jesus\", for which Canidian concoction the prescription is to be found in my book bearing thatTitle, Liber DCCCLXXXVIII.A.C. is unduly harsh with \"Jesus\". This is because at the time of writing the Commentaries his personality was stillreacting against the brainwashing of his early upbringing. Christian worship is not really more repugnant than itsparent, Attys worship. It is more a matter of clinical interest for psychiatrists today than a matter for condemnationby Thelemites. In His late years, having worked many changes by His Magick, He no longer paid attention to it. ButHe never thought it funny. Pathological methods of mysticism are funny only to pathological minds.50. There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! there are three ordeals in one, and it may begiven in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosenones in the highest. Thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not one know well the other!These ordeals are general: all Aspirants to Thelemic Initiation must pass through them. The conditions andcircumstances always vary according to the individual case.Don't think, either, that the ordeals get easier as you progress. They get harder. The late ordeals would disintegrateyour vehicles in the early stages of Initiation.51. There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silver and gold; lapis lazuli & jasper arethere; and all rare scents; jasmine & rose, and the emblems of death. Let him enter in turn or at once the fourgates; let him stand on the floor of the palace. Will he not sink? Amn. Ho! warrior, if thy servant sink? Butthere are means and means. Be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweetwines and wines that foam! Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will!But always unto me.The palace is Malkuth; the four gates are the four elements. Students must remember that common mankind does notdwell in Malkuth, but in the Qliphoth. The Probationer of the A.'. A.'. must pass through his first Initiation before heis permitted a glimpse of the palace. For it is the Palace of the King's Daughter, which only the Ipsissimus canreach, and live in.The first section of this verse is connected with the second only by the word 'therefore'. It appears to describe aninitiation, or perhaps The Initiation, in general terms. I would suggest that the palace is the 'Holy House' or Universeof the Initiate of the New Law. The four gates are perhaps Light, Life, Love, Liberty--see \"De Lege Libellum\". LapisLazuli is a symbol of Nuit, Jasper of Hadit. The rare scents are possibly various ecstasies or Samadhis. Jasmine andRose are Hieroglyphs of the two main Sacraments, while the emblems of death may refer to certain secrets of a wellknown exoteric school of initiation whose members, with the rarest exceptions, do not know what it is all about. (Herefers to Masonry.)The question then arises as to whether the initiate is able to stand firmly in this Place of Exaltation. It seems to me asif this refers to the ascetic life, commonly considered as an essential condition of participation in these mysteries.The answer is that \"there are means and means,\" implying that no one rule is essential. This is in harmony with ourgeneral interpretation of the law; it has as many rules as there are individuals.This word 'therefore' is easy to understand. We are to enjoy life thoroughly in an absolutely normal way, exactly asall the free and great have always done. The only point to remember is that one is a 'Member of the Body of God', a"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Star in the Body of Nuit. This being sure, we are urged to the fullest expansion of our several Natures, with specialattention to those pleasures which not only express the soul, but aid it to reach the higher developments of thatexpression.The act of Love is to the bourgeois (as the 'Christian' is called now-a-days) a gross animal gesture which shames hisboasted humanity. The appetite drags him at its hoofs; it tires him, disgusts him, diseases him, makes him ridiculouseven in his own eyes. It is the source of nearly all his neuroses.Against this monster he has devised two protections. Firstly, he pretends that it is a Fairy Prince disguised, and hangsit with the rags and tinsel of romance, sentiment, and religion. He calls it Love, denies its strength and truth, andworships this wax figure of him with all sorts of amiable lyrics and leers.Second, he is so certain, despite all his theatrical-wardrobe- work, that it is a devouring monster, that he resents withinsane ferocity the existence of people who laugh at his fears, and tell him the monster he fears is in reality not afire-breathing worm, but a spirited horse, well trained to the task of the bridle. They tell him not to be a gibberingcoward, but to learn to ride. Knowing well how abject he is, the kindly manhood of the advice is, to him, the bitterestinsult he can imagine, and he calls on the mob to stone the blasphemer. He is therefore particularly anxious to keepintact the bogey he so dreads; the demonstration that Love is a general passion, pure in itself, and the redeemer of allthem that put their trust in Him, is to tear open the raw ulcer of his soul.We of Thelema are not the slaves of Love. \"Love under will\" is the law. We refuse to regard love as shameful anddegrading, as a peril to body and soul. We refuse to accept it as the surrender of the divine to the animal; to us it isthe means by which the animal may be made the Winged Sphinx which shall bear man aloft to the House of theGods.We are then particularly careful to deny that the object of love is the gross physiological object which happens to beNature's excuse for it. Generation is a sacrament of the physical Rite, by which we create ourselves anew in our ownimage, weave in a new flesh- tapestry the Romance of our own Soul's History. But also Love is a sacrament ortransubstantiation whereby we initiate our own souls; it is the Wine of Intoxication as well as the Bread ofNourishment. \"Nor is he for priest designed Who partakes only in one kind.\"We therefore heartily cherish those forms of Love in which no question of generation arises; we use the stimulatingeffects of physical enthusiasm to inspire us morally and spiritually. Experience teaches that passions thus employeddo serve to refine and to exalt the whole being of man or woman. Nuit indicates the sole condition:\"But always unto me\".The epicure is not a monster of gluttony, nor the amateur of Beethoven a 'degenerate' from the 'normal' man whoseonly music is the tom-tom. So also the poisons which shook the bourgeois are not indulgences, but purifications; thebrute whose furtive lust demands that he be drunk and in darkness that he may surrender to his shame, and that he lieabout it with idiot mumblings ever after, is hardly the best judge even of Phryne. How much less should he ventureto criticize such men and women whose imaginations are so free from grossness that the element of attraction whichserves to electrify their magnetic coil is independent of physical form? To us the essence of Love is that it is asacrament unto Nuit, a gate of grace and a road of righteousness to Her High Palace, the abode of peerless puritywhose lamps are the Stars.\"As ye will.\" It should be abundantly clear from the foregoing remarks that each individual has an absolute andindefeasible right to use his sexual vehicle in accordance with its own proper character, and that he is responsibleonly to himself. But he should not injure himself and his right aforesaid; acts invasive of another individual's equalrights are implicitly self-aggressions. A thief can hardly complain on theoretical grounds if he is himself robbed.Such acts as rape, and the assault or seduction of infants, may therefore be justly regarded as offences against theLaw of Liberty, and repressed in the interests of that Law.It is also excluded from \"as ye will\" to compromise the liberty of another person indirectly, as by taking advantageof the ignorance or good faith of another person to expose that person to the constraint of sickness, poverty, socialdetriment, or child-bearing, unless with the well-informed and uninfluenced free will of that person."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"One must moreover avoid doing another person injury by deforming his or her nature; for instance, to flog childrenat or near puberty may distort the sensitive nascent sexual character, and impress it with the stamp of masochism.Again, homosexual practices between boys may in certain cases actually rob them of their virility, psychically oreven physically.Trying to frighten adolescents about sex by the bogeys of Hell, Disease, and Insanity, may warp the moral naturepermanently, and produce hypochondria or other mental maladies, with perversions of the enervated and thwartedinstinct.Repression of the natural satisfaction may result in addiction to secret and dangerous vices which destroy theirvictim because they are artificial and unnatural aberrations. Such moral cripples resemble those manufactured bybeggars by compressing one part of the body so that it is compensated by a monstrous exaggeration in another part.But on the other hand we have no right to interfere with any type of manifestation of the sexual impulse on a priorigrounds. We must recognize that the Lesbian leanings of idle and voluptuous women whose refinement finds thegrossness of the average male repugnant, are as inexpunguably entrenched in Righteousness as the parallel pleasuresof the English Aristocracy and Clergy whose aesthetics find women disgusting, and whose self-respect demands thatlove should transcend animal impulse, excite intellectual intimacy, and inspire spirituality by directing it towards anobject whose attainment cannot inflict the degradation of domesticity, and the bestiality of gestation.Every one should discover, by experience of every kind, the extent and intention of his own sexual Universe. Hemust be taught that all roads are equally royal, and that the only question for him is \"Which road is mine?\" Alldetails are equally likely to be of the essence of his personal plan, all equally 'right' in themselves, his own choice ofthe one as correct as, and independent of, his neighbour's preference for the other.He must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violatehis own true nature because public opinion, or mediaeval morality, or religious prejudice would wish he wereotherwise. The oyster stays shut in his shell for all Darwin may say about his \"low stage of evolution\", or Puritansabout his priapistic character, or idealists about his unfitness for civic government.The advocates of homosexuality--primus inter pares, John Addington Symonds! --hammer away like Hercules at thespiritual, social, moral, and intellectual advantages of cultivating the caresses of a comrade who combines Apollowith Achilles and Antinous at the expense of escaping from a Chimaera with Circe's head, Cleopatra's body, andCressida's character.Why can't they let one alone? I agree to agree; I only stipulate to be allowed to be inconsistent. I will confess theircreed, so long as I may play the part of Peter until the cock crow thrice.They urge more strenuously still the claims of homosexuality to heal the hurts and horrors of humanity, almost the'complete cohort'. On this point I concur that they argue indisputably, with sober sense to support and stress ofsuffering to spur them. They prove with Euler's exactness and Hinton's passion that heterosexuality entrains aninfinity of ills; jealousy, abortions, diseases, infanticides, frauds, intrigues, quarrels, poverty, prostitution,persecution, idleness, self- indulgence, social stress, over-population, sex-antagonism. They show with Poincares'sprecision that Jesus and Paul struck at the heart of hell when they proclaimed marriage a scourge, and offered thetestimony of John and Timothy to support the plea of Plato on behalf of paederastic passion. Out of the Court thereslunk Mark Anthony, his toga to his face, one of the legion of lost souls that woman had withered; behind himgroped blind Sampson, disinherited Adam, feeling his way along the table where they had piled countless papyri writwith woes of kings and sages woman-wrecked, and many a map of towns and temples torn and trampled beneath thefeet of Love, their ashes smouldering still, and smoky with song to witness how Astarte's breath had kindled andconsumed them. Extinguished empires owned that their doom was the device of Venus, her vengeance on virility.By Paul sat Buddha smiling, Ananda's arm about his neck, while Mohammed paced the floor impatiently betweentwo warrior comrades, his belt bearing an iron key, a whip, and a sword, wherewith to limit women's liberty, theirlove, their life, lest to his loss they lure him.The Beast is there also, aloof, attentive. He will not weigh the evidence in the balances of any particular kind of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"advantage. He will not admit any standard as adequate to assess the absolute. To him, the pettiest personal whimsyoutweighs all wisdom, all philosophy, all private profit and all public prudence. The sexual obol of the meanest isstamped with the signature of his own sovereign soul, lawful and current coin no less than the gold talent of hisneighbour. The derelict moon has the same right to drift round Earth as Regulus to blaze in the heart of the Lion.Collision is the only crime in the cosmos.The Beast refuses therefore to assent to any argument as to the propriety of any fashion of formulating the soul insymbols of sex. A canon is no less deadly in love than in art or literature; its acceptance stifles style, and itsenforcement extinguishes sincerity.It is better for a person of heterosexual nature to suffer every possible calamity as the indirect environment-evokedresult of his doing his true will in that respect than to enjoy health, wealth and happiness by means either ofsuppressing sex altogether, or debauching it to the service of Sodom or Gomorrah.Equally it is better for the androgyne, the urning, or their feminine counterparts to endure blackmailers private andpublic, the terrors of police persecution, the disgust, contempt and loathing of the vulgar, and the self-torture ofsuspecting the peculiarity to be a symptom of a degenerate nature, than to wrong the soul by damning it to the hell ofabstinence, or by defiling it with the abhorred embraces of antipathetic arms.Every star must calculate its own orbit. All is Will, and yet all is Necessity. To swerve is ultimately impossible; toseek to swerve is to suffer.The Beast 666 ordains by His authority that every man, and every woman, and every intermediately-sexedindividual, shall be absolutely free to interpret and communicate Self by means of any sexual practices soever,whether direct or indirect, rational or symbolic, physiologically, legally, ethically, or religiously approved or no,provided only that all parties to any act are fully aware of all the implications and responsibilities thereof, andheartily agree thereto.Moreover, the Beast 666 adviseth that all children shall be accustomed from infancy to witness every type of sexualact, as also the process of birth, lest falsehood fog, and mystery stupefy, their minds, whose error else might thwartand misdirect the growth of their subconscious system of soul-symbolism.\"When, where and with whom ye will.\" The phrase \"with whom\" has been practically covered by the comment on\"as ye will.\" One need no more than distinguish that the earlier phrase permits all manner of acts, the latter allpossible partners. There would have been no Furies for Oedipus, no disaster for Othello, Romeo, Pericles of Tyre,Laon and Cythna, if it were only agreed to let sleeping dogs lie, and mind one's own business. In real life, we haveseen in our own times Oscar Wilde, Sir Charles Dilke, Parnell, Canon Aitken and countless others, many of themengaged in first-rate work for the world, all wasted, because the mob must make believe to be \"moral\". This phraseabolishes the Eleventh Commandment, Not to be Found Out, by authorizing Incest, Adultery, and Paederasty, whichevery one now practices with humiliating precautions, which perpetuate the schoolboy's enjoyment of an escapade,and make shame, slyness, cowardice and hypocrisy the conditions of success in life.It is also a fact that the tendency of any individual to sexual irregularity is emphasized by the preoccupation with thesubject which follows its factitious importance in modem society.It is to be observed that Politeness has forbidden any direct reference to the subject of sex to secure no happier resultthan to allow Sigmund Freud and others to prove that our every other thought, speech, and gesture, conscious orunconscious, is an indirect reference!Unless one wants to wreck the neighbourhood, it is best to explode one's gunpowder in an unconfined space.There are very few cases of \"perverted hunger-instinct\" in moderately healthy communities. War restrictions on foodcreated dishonest devices to procure dainties, and artificial attempts to appease the ache of appetite by chemicalcounterfeits.The South-Sea Islanders, pagan, amoral and naked, are temperate lovers, free from hysterical \"crimes of passion\","},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"sex obsessions, and puritan persecution-mania; perversion is practically unknown, and monogamy is the generalcustom.Even the civilized psychopaths of cities, forced into every kind of excess by the omnipresence of erotic suggestionsand the contact of crazed crowds seething with suppressed sexuality, are not wholly past physic. They are no soonerreleased from the persistent pressure by escaping to some place where the inhabitants treat the reproductive and therespiratory organs as equally innocent than they begin insensibly to forget their 'fixed idea' forced on them by thefog-horn of Morality, so that their perversions perish,just as a coiled spring straightens itself when the externalcompulsion is removed. They revert to their natural sex-characters, which only in rare cases are other than simple,pure, and refined. More, sex itself ceases to play Principal Boy in the Pantomime of Life. Other interests resumetheir proper proportions.We may now inquire why the Book is at pains to admit as to love \"when\" and \"where\" we will. Few people, surely,have been seriously worried by restrictions of time and place. One can only think of lovers who live with fearsomefamilies or in inhospitable lodgings, on a rainy night, buffeted from one police-bullied hotel to another.Perhaps this permission is intended to indicate the propriety of performing the sexual act without shame or fear, notwaiting for darkness or seeking secrecy, but by daylight in public places, as serenely as if it were a natural incidentin a morning stroll. (If that be your will, of course.)Custom would soon surfeit curiosity, and copulation attract less attention than a new fashion in frocks. For theexisting interest in sexual matters is chiefly because, common as the act is, it is closely concealed. Nobody is excitedby seeing others eat. A \"naughty\" book is as dull as a volume of sermons; only genius can vitalize either.Further, once love is taken for granted, the morbid fascination of its mystery will vanish.The pander, the prostitute, the parasite will find their occupation gone.Disease will go straight to the doctor instead of to the quack, as it does (Please remember this was written in theTwenties; the Magick of the Beast has already operated many changes.); the altars of Mrs. Grundy run red with theblood of her faithful!The ignorance or carelessness of a raw youth will no longer hound him to hell. A blighted career or a ruinedconstitution will no more be the penalty of a moment's exuberance.Above all, the world will begin to appreciate the true nature of the sexual process, its physical insignificance as oneamong many parts of the body, its transcendent importance as the vehicle of the True Will and the first of the sheathsof the Self.Hitherto our sexual tabus have kept far ahead of Gilbert and Sullivan. We have made love the lackey to property, aswho should pay his rent by sneezing. We have swaddled it in politeness, as who should warn God off the grass.We have muddled it up with morality, as who should frown at the Himalayas on the one hand, and, on the other,regulate his behaviour by that of an ant-heap.The Law of Thelema is here!52. If this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many; ifthe ritual he not ever unto me: then expect the direful judgments of Ra Hoor Khuit!It is not true to say either that we are separate Stars, or One Star. Each Star is individual, yet each is bound to theothers by Law. (There is also a technical meaning to this, already explained in other notes 'by another'.) ThisFreedom under Law is one of the most difficult yet important doctrines of this Book. So too the ritual--our lives--must be unto Nuit; for She is the Ultimate to which we tend, the asymptote of our curve. Failure in this one-pointedness sets up the illusion of duality, which leads to excision and destruction.\"Direful\"; because Ra-Hoor-Khuit is a \"God of war and of vengeance\"; see Chapter III."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The doctrine of the previous verses, which appears not merely to allow sexual liberty in the ordinary sense, but evento advocate it in a sense which is calculated to shock the most abandoned libertine, can do no less than startle andalarm the magician, and that only the more so as he is familiar with the theory and practice of his art. \"What is this,in the name of Adonai?\" I hear him exclaim. \"Is it not the immemorial and unchallenged tradition that the exorcistwho would apply himself to the most elementary operations of our Art is bound to prepare himself by a course ofchastity? Is it not notorious that virginity is by its own virtue one of the most powerful means, and one of the mostessential conditions, of all Magical works? This is no question of technical formulae such as may, with propriety, bemodulated in the event of an Equinox of the Gods. It is one of those eternal truths of Nature which persist, no matterwhat the environment, in respect of place or period.\"To these remarks I can but smile my most genial assent. The only objection that I can take to them is to point out thatthe connotation of the word 'chastity' may have been misunderstood from a scientific point of view, just as modernscience has modified our conception of the relations of the earth and the sun without presuming to alter one jot ortittle of the observed facts of Nature. So we may assert that modern discoveries in Physiology have renderedobsolete the Osirian conceptions of the sexual process which interpreted chastity as physical abstinence, small regardbeing paid to the mental and moral concomitants of the refusal to act, still less to the physical indications. The rootof the error lies in the dogma of original sin, as a result of which pollution was actually excused as being in thenature of involuntary offence, just as if one were to assert that a sleep-walker who has fallen over a precipice wereany less dead than Empedocles or Sappho.The doctrine of Thelema resolves the whole question in conformity with the facts observed by science and theproprieties prescribed by Magick. It must be obvious to the most embryonic tyro in alchemy that if there be anymaterial substance soever endowed with Magical properties, one must class, primus inter pares, that vehicle ofessential humanity which is the first matter of that Great Work wherein our race shares the divine prerogative ofcreating man in its own image, male and female. (Let us not forget, lest we turn pious, that all species share thisdivine prerogative, from viruses down or up, in one way or another. And that even crystals share it too.)It is evidently of minor importance whether the will to create be consciously formulated. Lot in his drunkennessserved the turn of his two daughters, no less than Jupiter, who prolonged the night to forty-eight hours in order togive himself time to beget Hercules.Man is in actual possession of this supreme talisman. It is his \"pearl of great price,\" in comparison with which allother jewels are but gewgaws. It is his prime duty to preserve the integrity of this substance. He must not allow itsquality to be impaired either by malnutrition or by disease. He must not destroy it like Origen and Klingsor. He mustnot waste it like Onan.But physiology informs us that we are bound to waste it, no matter what be our continence, so long as we are liableto sleep; and Nature, whether by precaution or by prodigality, provides us with so great an excess of the substancethat the reproduction of the human race need not slacken, though the proportion of men to women were no more than3 to the 1000. The problem of efficiency consequently appears practically insoluble.We are now struck with the fact that Nuit commands us to exercise the utmost freedom in our choice of the methodof utilizing the services of this our first, our finest and our fieriest talisman; the license appears at first sightunconditioned in the most express and explicit terms that it is possible to employ. The caveat, \"But always unto me\",sounds like an afterthought. We are almost shocked when, in the following verse, we discover a menace, none theless dread because of the obscurity of its terms.Our first consideration only adds to our sense of surprised repugnance. It becomes evident that one type of act isforbidden, with the penalty of falling altogether from the law of liberty to the code of crime; and our amazement andhorror only increase as we recognize that this single gesture which is held damnable is the natural exercise of themost fatidical function of nature, the innocent indulgence of irresistible impulse. We glance back to the previousverse--we examine our charter. We are permitted to take our fill and will of love as we will, when, where and withwhom we will, but there is nothing said about why we will. On the contrary, despite the infinite variety of lawfulmeans, there is one end held lawful, and no more than one. The act has only one legitimate object: it must beperformed unto Nuit. Further reflection reassures us to some extent, not directly, in the manner of the jurist, butindirectly, by calling our attention to the facts of Nature which underlie the ethics of the question. Nuit is that from"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"which we have come, that to which we must return. Evasion of the issue is no more possible than was alternation ofthe antecedent. From Nuit we received this talisman, which conveys our physical identity through the ages of time.To Nuit, therefore, we owe it; and to defile any portion of that purest and divinest quintessence of ourselves isevidently the supreme blasphemy. Nothing in nature can be misapplied. It is our first duty to ourselves to preservethe treasure entrusted to us: \"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\"The nature of man is individual. No two faces are identical, still less are two individuals. Unspeakable is the varietyof form and immeasurable the diversity of beauty, but in all is the seal of unity, inasmuch as all cometh from thewomb of Nuit--to it returneth all. The apprehension of this sublimity is the mark of divinity. Knowing this, all isliberty; ignorant of this, all is bondage. As no two individuals are identical, so also there can be no identity betweenthe quintessential expressions of the will of any two persons; and the expression of each person, in the first instance,as his purely physical prerogative, is his sexual gesture.One cannot say that any significance of that gesture is forbidden, for \"There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.\"But this may and shall be said, that a significance which indicates ignorance or forgetfulness of the central truth ofthe Universe is an acquiescence in that opacity caused by the confusion of the veils which conceal the soul from theconsciousness, and thus create the illusion which the aspirant calls Sorrow, and the uninitiate, Evil.The sexual act, even to the grossest of mankind, is the agent which dissipates the fog of self for one ecstatic moment.It is the instinctive feeling that the physical spasm is symbolic of that miracle of the Mass, by which the materialwafer, composed of the passive elements, earth and water, is transmuted into the substance of the Body of God, thatmakes the wise man dread lest so sublime a sacrament suffer profanation. It is this that has caused him, in half-instinctive, half intellectual half-comprehension of the nature of the truth, that has driven him to fence the act aboutwith taboos. But a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. His fear has created phantoms, and his malobservationsuggested precautions scarce worthy to be called empirical. We see him combat analogous difficulties in a preciselysimilar manner. History shows us the physician defending mankind against plague, with exorcisms on the one handand useless herbs on the other. A charred stake is driven through the heart of a vampire, and his victim is protectedwith garlic. The strength of God, who can doubt? The strength of taste and smell are known facts. So they measuredstrength against strength without considering whether the one was appropriate to the other, any more than as if onewere to ward off the strength of steel swords by the strength of the colour of one's armour. Modern science, bycorrect classification, has expounded the doctrine of the magical link. We no longer confuse the planes. Wemanipulate physical phenomena by physical means; mental by mental. We trace things to their true causes, and nolonger seek to cut the Gordian knot of our ignorance by the sword of a postulated Pantheon.Physiology leaves us in no doubt as to the power of our inherited talisman. And modern discoveries in psychologyhave made it clear enough that the sexual peculiarities of people are hieroglyphs, obscure yet not unintelligible,revealing their histories in the first place, in the second, their relations with environment in the present, and in thethird, their possibilities with regard to the modification of the future.In these supremely important verses of the Book of the Law, it becomes clear that Nuit (He means Aiwass, of course.Readers must never make the mistake of anthropomorphizing Nuit! Remember verse 27!) is aware of all these facts(It is silly to state that Nuit is \"aware of all these facts\"; Nuit IS all these facts! But \"He must speak\".), and that sheregards them as no less than the combination of the lock of the strong room of the future. \"This (doctrine) shallregenerate the world, the little world, my sister\". The misunderstanding of sex, the ignorant fear like a fog, theignorant lust like a miasma, these things have done more to keep back humanity from realization of itself, and fromintelligent cooperation with its destiny, than any other dozen things put together. The vileness and falseness ofreligion itself have been monsters aborted from the dark womb of its infernal mystery.There is nothing unclean or degrading in any manifestation soever of the sexual instinct, because, without exception,every act is an impulsively projected image of the Will of the individual who, whether man or woman, is a star; thePennsylvanian with his pig no less than the Spirit with Mary; Sappho with Athis and Apollo with Hyacinth as perfectas Daphnis with Chloe or as Galahad vowed to the Graal. The one thing needful, the all-perfect means ofpurification, consecration, and sanctification, is independent of the physical and moral accidents circumstantial ofthe particular incident: is the realization of love as a sacrament. The use of the physical means as a MagicalOperation, whose formula is that by uniting two opposites, by dissolving both, annihilating both, we create a thirdthing which transcends that opposition (that phase of duality which constitutes the consciousness of imperfection)"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"and is perceived as the absolute negative whose apprehension is identical with that duality (of opposites that unite)--this is the accomplishment of the Great Work. (Not necessarily so; but always a step towards that accomplishment.)The anacephalepsis of these considerations is this:1. The accidents of any act of love, such as its protagonists and their peculiarities of expression on whatever plane,are totally immaterial to the magical import of the act. (He means that spiritual results independ of material codes ofbehaviour to which individuals of variant natures should be supposed to conform. A queer or a Lesbian, to put itbluntly, may arrive to spiritual perception through a homosexual act of love just as a heterosexual might, or just asmight a man or woman in intercourse with an animal, or praying in church, provided they \"inflame themselves\"enough. Obviously, they would not inflame themselves through a mod us operandi unsympathetic to their natures.The rest of the paragraph clarifies this very difficult and vitally important point.) Each person is responsible tohimself, being a star, to travel in his own orbit, composed of his own elements, to shine with his own light, with thecolour proper to his own nature, to revolve and to rush with his own inherent motion, and to maintain his ownrelation with his own galaxy in its own place in the Universe. His existence is his sole and sufficient justification forhis own matter and manner.2. His only possible error is to withdraw himself from this consciousness of himself as both unique in himself andnecessary to the norm of nature. (Please note that most people, being unaware of their true wills, shall constantly tryto make him conform with their twisted and confused vision of things. This sad situation is changing gradually,thanks to the Magick of the Beast.)To bring down this doctrine to a practical rule for every man or woman by which they may enjoy in perfection theirsexual life and make it what it rightly is, the holiest part of the religious life, I say 'holiest' because it redeems evenphysical grossness to partake with spiritual saintship, the intention of the Book of the Law is perfectly simple.Whatever your sexual predilections maybe, you are free, by the Law of Thelema, to be the star you are, to go yourown way rejoicing. It is not indicated here in the text, though it is elsewhere implied, that only one symptom warnsyou that you have mistaken your True Will, and that is, if you should imagine that in pursuing your way youinterfere with that of another star. It may, therefore, be considered improper, as a general rule, for your sexualgratification to destroy, deform, or displease any other star. (By 'displease another star' is not meant to offend theprejudices of its personality! He or she who is doing his or her True Will knows when he or she really displeasesanother. As to destroy or deform: the influence of the 'Black Brothers' is towards this, they being insane, and theiregos hostile to other Beings. You must learn to detect it. Also, you must not mistake the destruction of a person whois interfering with your True Will-- such as a 'Black Brother'!--with the attempt to destroy--it can never be more thanan attempt--or deform that person's Starry Nature. See Liber NV, verses 9-11. The key is that the influence of the'Black Brothers' is turned against any personality that is expressing, or trying to express, its Starry Nature. Theirdiseased egos feel this, rightly, as an attack on their integrity. They fear love, because love will destroy--that is,change--them.) Mutual consent to the act is the condition thereof. It must, of course, be understood that such consentis not always explicit. There are cases when seduction or rape may be emancipation or initiation to another. Suchacts can only be judged by their results. (If you have the least inner qualm against interfering when you see a manforcing his attentions on a woman, for instance--do not interfere.)The most important condition of the act, humanly speaking, is that the attraction should be spontaneous andirresistable; a leaping up of the will to create with lyrical frenzy. This first condition once recognized, it should besurrounded with every circumstance of worship. Study and experience should furnish a technique of love. Allscience, all art, every elaboration should emphasize and adorn the expression of the enthusiasm. All strength and allskill should be summoned to fulfill the frenzy. And life itself should be flung with a spendthrift gesture on thecounter of the Merchant of Madness. On the steel of your helmet let there be gold inlaid with the motto \"ExcessThe above indications are taken from a subsequent passage of the third chapter of this Book.The supreme and absolute injunction, the crux of your knightly oath, is that you lay your lance in rest to the glory ofyour Lady, the Queen of the Stars, Nuit. Your knighthood depends upon your refusal to fight in any lesser cause.That is what distinguishes you from the brigand and the bully. You give your life on Her Altar. You make yourselfworthy of Her by your readiness to fight at any time, in anyplace, with any weapon, and at any odds. For Her, fromWhom you come, of Whom you are, to Whom you go, your life is no more and no less than one continuous"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"sacrament. You have no word but Her praise, no thought but love of Her. You have only one cry, of inarticulateecstasy, the intense spasm, possession of Her, and Death, to Her. You have no act but the priest's gesture that makesyour body Hers. The wafer is the disk of the Sun, the star in Her body. Your blood is spilt from your heart with everybeat of your pulse into her cup. It is the wine of Her life crushed from the grape of your sunripened vine. On thiswine you are drunk. It washes your corpse that is as the fragment of the Host, broken by you, the Priest, into Hergolden chalice. You, Knight and Priest of the Order of the Temple, saying Her mass, become God in Her, by loveand death. This act of love, though in its form it be with a horse like Caligula, with a mob like Messalina, with agiant like Heliogabalus, with a pollard like Nero, with a monster like Baudelaire, though with de Sade it gloat onblood, with Sacher-Masoch crave for whips and furs, with Yvette Guilbert crave the glove, or dote on babes like E.T. Reed of \"Punch\"; whether one love oneself, disdaining every other like Narcissus, offer oneself loveless to everylove like Catherine, or find the body so vain as to enclose one's lust in the soul and make one lifelong spinthriaunassuaged in the imagination like Aubrey Beardsley, the means matter no whit. Bach takes one way, Keats one,Goya one. The end is everything: that by the act, whatever it is, one worships, loves, possesses, and becomes Nuit.The act of love can no more \"trammel up his consequence\" than any other act. As long as you possess the talisman, itmust be used from time to time, whether you will or no. If you injure the quality, or diminish the quantity, of thatquintessence, you blaspheme yourself, and betray the trust reposed in you when you accepted the obligation of thatausterely chivalrous Order called Manhood. The powers of the talisman are irresistible like every other natural force.Every time they are used, a child must be begotten. This child must be in your own image, a symbol of your nature,an expression of your true subconscious Will.It is, of course, only once in many times that the conditions allow of the production of a human child. What happenswhen (either by chance or by design) that obvious effect is prevented? The materialist may imagine that with thedestruction of the complex it becomes harmless, its potentialities aborted, just as the violence of sulphuric acidcomes to naught if it be neutralized by caustic soda. But he is a very poor materialist if he says so. The fullpossibilities of the acid must be accounted for in one way or another. If it does not dissolve a metal, it may carbonizea sugar, generate a gas, give off heat, or in one way or another fulfill absolutely every possibility which it inheritedfrom the forces that went to make it. It is manifestly a contradiction of the laws of the Conservation of matter andenergy, that a substance should lose by being transformed. It is contrary to Nature that a man, with potentialitieswhich can transform the face of the earth, should become nothing but inert carrion when he happens to die.Everything that he was must inevitably persist; and if the manifestation be not to one set of senses, why then, toanother! The idea of creation from nothing of something and the destruction of something to nothing, exploded withthe theory of Phlogiston.It stands plain, even to sceptical reason--indeed, most of all to the sceptic--that our talisman, one microscopic serpentof which can build for itself such a house as to rule men's bodies for a generation like Alexander, or their minds foran epoch like Plato, cannot be destroyed or diminished by any conceivable force.When this talisman comes forth from its fortress, its action begins. The ancient Jewish Rabbins knew this, and taughtthat before Eve was given to Adam the demon Lilith conceived by the spilth of his dreams, so that the hybrid race ofsatyrs, elves and the like began to populate the secret places of the earth which are not sensible by the organs of thenormal man.I take it as certain that every offering of this talisman infallibly begets children on one plane or another of this ourcosmos, whose matter is so varied in kind. Such a child must partake of its father's nature; and its character will bedetermined, partly by the environment in which it is bred to manifestation, lives, and ultimately changes in what wecall death, and partly by the inmost will of the father, perhaps modified to some extent by his conscious will at thetime of his slipping the leash.This being so, it becomes tremendously important to a man that he should become conscious of his true inmost Will,of his essential nature. This is the Great Work whose attainment constitutes adeptship, provided that theconsciousness recognizes that its own dependence on circumstance makes it no more than a troubled image in foulwater of the sun which is that Silent Self. If such a man wants to develop his powers, he must use this tremendoustalisman to create in his own image.Although this talisman has such miraculous might, it is also intensely sensitive. Put in an unsuitable environment, it"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"may produce grotesque or malignant perversions of its father's Word. We are all aware that fine children are born ofhealthy mothers who are true and worthy mates of their husbands. The children of hate, of debauch, of sickness,nearly always bear witness in body and mind to the abuse of the talisman. (Readers must not interpret 'debauch' interms of standards of 'morality'. The term is used in the Initiatic sense. Some seemingly casual couplings are holy;some lifelong 'marriages' are debauch of body and soul. Love must be under will.) Not only the sins of the father butthose of the mother, yes, more, those of their social surroundings, are visited on the children to the third and fourthgeneration. Nay, more, the mischief can never be mended. A man can destroy in a minute his kingdom, inheritedfrom unnumbered dynasties of biological prudence.It will also be admitted, without reference to Magick, that the abuse of the talisman leads to moral, mental andspiritual misfortune. Crime and insanity, as well as disease and debility, are constantly seen as the direct result ofmismanaging the sexual life, either tactically, strategically, or both.The Book of the Law emphasizes the importance of these considerations. The act of love must be spontaneous, inabsolute freedom. The man must be true to himself. Romeo must not be thrust on Rosaline for family, social, orfinancial reasons. Desdemona must not be barred from Othello for reasons of race or religion. The homosexual mustnot blaspheme his nature and commit spiritual suicide by suppressing love or attempting to pervert it, as ignoranceand fear, shame and weakness, so often induce him to do. Whatever the act which expresses the soul, that act and noother is right.But, on the other hand, whatever the act may be it is always a sacrament; and, however profaned, it is alwaysefficient. To profane it is only to turn food into poison. The act must be pure and passionate. It must be held as theunion with God in the heart of the Holy of Holies. One must never forget that a child will be born of that deed. Onemust choose the environment appropriate to the particular child which one wills to create. One must make sure thatthe conscious will is written, on the pure waters of a mind unstirred, in letters of fire, by the Sun of the Soul. Onemust not create confusion in the talisman, which belongs to the Silent Self, by letting the speaking self deny thepurpose which produced it. If one's true Will, the reason of one's incarnation, be to bring peace on earth, one mustnot perform an act of love with motives of jealousy or emulation.One must fortify one's body to the utmost, and protect it from every disaster, so that the substance of the talismanmay be as perfect as possible. One must calm the mind, increasing its knowledge, organizing its powers, resolvingits tangles, so that it may truly apprehend the Silent Self, judge partial pleas and unbalanced opinions, whilesupporting the concentration of the Will by its fortified frontiers, and, with unanimous enthusiasm, acclaiming theLordship of the thought which expresses the act. The Will must seal itself upon the substance of the talisman. It mustbe, in alchemical language, the Sulphur which fixes the Mercury which determines the nature of the Salt. The wholeman, from his inmost Godhead to the tip of his tiniest eyelash, must be one engine, cumbered with nothing useless,nothing inharmonious; a thunderbolt from the hand of Jove. It must give its elf utterly in the one act of love. It mustcease to know itself as anything but the Will. It must not have the will; it must transform itself completely to be theWill.Last of all, the act must be supreme. It must do and it must die. From that death it must rise again, purged of thatWill, having accomplished it so perfectly that nothing is left thereof in its elements. It must have emptied itself intothe vehicle. So shall the child be whole of spirit.But this is not enough. The ground in which the seed is cast must be suitable for its reception. The climate must befavorable, the soil must be prepared, and the enemies of the young child that seek its life must be driven beyondrange of malice. These points are obvious enough, if applied to the ordinary affair of breeding children. One needsthe right woman, and the right conditions for her. It applies even more closely to other acts, for woman is protectedby generations of biological adaptation, whereas spiritual children are more easily diseased and deformed, being ofsubtler and more sensitive matter. So infinitely varied are the possibilities of creation that each adept must work outeach problem for himself as best he can. There are magical methods of making a link between the force generatedand the matter on which it is desired to act; but these are, for the most part, best communicated by private instructionand developed by personal practice. The crude description is a bare framework, and (even so) more often misleadsthan not.But the general rule is to arrange all the conditions beforehand with intent to facilitate the manifestation of the thing"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"willed, and to prevent the dangers of abortion by eliminating discordant elements.For instance: a man seeking to regain health should assist his Magical Will by taking all possible hygienic andmedical measures proper to amend his malady. A man wishing to develop his genius as a sculptor will devotehimself to study and training, will surround himself with beautiful forms, and, if possible, live in a place wherenature herself testifies to the touch of the thumb of the Great Architect.He will choose the object of his passion at the nod of his Silent Self. He will not allow the prejudice, either of sense,emotion, or rational judgement, to obscure the Sun of his Soul. In the first place, mutual magnetism, despite themasks of mind, should be unmistakable. Unless it exists, a puissant purity of passion, there is no Magical basis forthe Sacrament. Yet, such magnetism is only the first condition. Where two people become intimate, each crisis ofsatisfaction between the terminals leaves them in a proximity which demands mutual observation; and the intenseclarity of the mind which results from the discharge of the electric force makes such observation abnormally critical.The higher the type of mind, the more certain this is, and the greater the danger of finding some antipathetic triflewhich experience tells us will one day be the one thing left to observe; just as a wart on the nose is rememberedwhen the rest of the face is forgotten.The object of Love must therefore be one with the lover in something more than the Will to unite magnetically; itmust be in passionate partnership with the Will of which the Will-to-love is only the Magical symbol. Perhaps notwo wills can be identical, but at least they can be so sympathetic that the manifestations are not likely to clash. It isnot enough to have a partner of the passive type who bleats \"Thy will be done\"--that ends in contempt, boredom anddistrust. One wants a passion that can blend with one's own. Where this is the case, it does not matter so muchwhether the mental expression is syndromic; it is, indeed, better when two entirely different worlds of thought andexperience have led to sister conclusions. But it is essential that the habit of mind should be sympathetic, that themachinery should be constructed on similar principles. The psychology of the one should be intelligible to the other.Social position and physical appearance and habits are of far less importance, specially in a society which hasaccepted the Law of Thelema. Tolerance itself produces suavity, and suavity soon relieves the strain on tolerance. Inany case, most people, especially women, adapt themselves adroitly enough to their environment. I say \"Especiallywomen,\" for women are nearly always conscious of an important part of their true Will; the bearing of children. Tothem nothing else is serious in comparison, and they dismiss questions which do not bear on this as trifles, adoptingthe habits required of them in the interest of the domestic harmony which they recognize as a condition favourable toreproduction.I have outlined ideal conditions. Rarely indeed can we realize even a third of our possibilities. Our Magical engine ismighty indeed when its efficiency reaches 50% of its theoretical horsepower. But the enormous majority of mankindhave no idea whatever of taking Love as a sacred and serious thing, of using the eye of the microscopist, or the heartand brain of the artist. Their ignorance and their shame have made Love a carcass of pestilence; and Love hasavenged the outrage by crushing their lives when they pull down the temple upon them.The chance of finding a suitable object of Love has been reduced well nigh to zero by substituting for the actualconditions, as stated in the above paragraphs, a totally artificial and irrelevant series; the restrictions on the act itself,marriage, opinion, the conspiracy of silence, criminal laws,financial fetters, selections limited by questions of race,nationality, caste, religion, social and political cliqueishness, even family exclusiveness. Out of the millions ofhumanity the average person is lucky if he can take his pick of a couple of score of partners.I will here add one further pillar to my temple. It happens only too often that two people, absolutely fitted in everyway to love each other, are totally debarred from expressing themselves by sheer ignorance of the technique of theact. What Nature declares as the climax of the Mass, the manifestation of God in the flesh, when the flesh isbegotten, is so gross, clumsy and brutal that it disappoints and disgusts. They are horribly conscious that somethingis wrong. They do not know how to amend it. They are ashamed to discuss it. They have neither the experience toguide nor the imagination to experiment. Countless thousands of delicate-minded lovers turn against Love andblaspheme Him. Countless millions, not quite so fixed in refinement, accept the fact, acquiesce in the foulness, tillLove is degraded to guilty grovelling. They are dragged in the dirt of the nightcart which ought to have been their\"chariot of fire and the horses thereof'.This whole trouble comes from humanity's horror of Love. For the last hundred years, every first-rate writer on"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"morals has sent forth his lightning and thunders, hailstones and coals of fire, to burn up Gomorrah and Sodom whereLove is either shameful and secret, or daubed with dung of sentiment in order that the swinish citizens mayrecognize their ideal therein. We do not tell the artist that his art is so sacred, so disgusting, so splendid and sodisgraceful that he must not on any account learn the use of the tools of his trade, and study in school how to seewith the eye, and record what he sees with his hand. We do not tell the man who would heal disease that he must notknow his subject, from Anatomy to Pathology; or bid him undertake to remove an appendix from a valuedArchbishop the first time he takes his scalpel in hand.But love is an art no less than Rembrandt's, a science no less than Lister's. The mind must make the heart articulate,and the body the temple of the soul. The animal instinct in man is the twin of the ape's or the bull's. Yet this is theone thing lawful in the code of the bourgeois. He is right to consider the act, as he knows it, degrading. It is, indeedfor him, an act ridiculous, obscene, gross, beastly; a wallowing unworthy either of the dignity of man or of themajesty of the God within him. So is the guzzling and the swilling of the savage as he crams his enemy's raw liverinto his mouth, or tilts the bottle of trade gin, and gulps. Because his meal is loathly, must we insist that any methodsbut his are criminal? How did we come to Laperouse and Nighol from the cannibal's cauldron unless by critical careand vigorous research?The act of Love, to the bourgeois, is a physical relief like defaecation, and a moral relief from the strain of the drillof decency; a joyous relapse into the brute he has to pretend he despises. It is a drunkenness which drugs his shameof himself, yet leaves him deeper in disgust. It is an unclean gesture, hideous and grotesque. It is not his own act, butforced on him by a giant who holds him helpless; he is half madman, half automaton when he performs it. It is agawky stumbling across a black foul bog, oozing a thousand dangers. It threatens him with death, disease, disasterinall manner of forms. He pays the coward's price of fear and loathing when pedlar Sex holds out his Rat-Poison in thelead-paper wrapping he takes for silver; he pays again with vomiting and with colic when he has gulped it in hisgreed.All this he knows, only too well; he is right, by his own lights, to loathe and fear the act, to hide it from his eyes, toswear he knows it not. With tawdry rags of sentiment, sacksful of greasy clouts, he swathes the corpse of Love, and,smirking, sputters that Love had never a naked limb; then, as the brute in him stirs sleepily, he plasters Love withmire, and leering grunts that Love was never a God in the Temple Man, but a toothsome lump of carrion in thecorner of his own stye.But we of Thelema, like the artist, the true lover of Love, shameless and fearless, seeing God face to face alike in ourown souls and in all Nature without, though we use, as the bourgeois does, the word Love, we hold not the word\"too often profaned for us to profane it\"; it burns inviolate in its sanctuary, being reborn immaculate with everybreath of life. But by 'Love' we mean a thing which the eye of the bourgeois has not seen, nor his ear heard; neitherhath his heart conceived it. We have accepted Love as the meaning of Change, Change being the Life of all Mattersoever in the Universe. And we have accepted Love as the mode of Motion of the Will to Change. To us every act,as implying Change, is an act of Love. Life is a dance of delight, its rhythm an infinite rapture that never can wearyor stale. Our personal pleasure in it is derived not only from our own part in it, but from our conscious apprehensionof its total perfections. We study its structure, we expand ourselves as we lose ourselves in understanding it, and sobecoming one with it. With the Egyptian initiate we exclaim \"There is no part of us that is not of the Gods\"; and addthe antistrophe: \"There is no part of the Gods that is not also of us.\"Therefore, the Love that is Law is no less Love in the petty personal sense; for Love that makes two One is theengine whereby even the final Two, Self and Not-Self, may become One, in the mystic marriage of the Bride, theSoul, with him appointed from eternity to espouse her; yes, even the Most High, God All-in-All, the Truth.Therefore we hold Love holy, our heart's religion, our mind's science. Shall He not have His ordered Rite, His priestsand poets, His makers of beauty in colour and form to adorn Him, His makers of music to praise Him? Shall not Histheologians, divining His nature, declare Him? Shall not even those who but sweep the courts of His temple, partakethereby of His person? And shall not our science lay hands on Him, measure Him, discover the depths, calculate theheights, and decipher the laws of His nature?Also: to us of Thelema, thus having trained our hearts and minds to be expert engineers of the sky-cleaver Love, theship to soar to the Sun, to us the act of Love is the consecration of the body to Love.

We do not denythe existence of the body, or despise it; but we refuse to regard it in any other light than this: it is the organ of theSelf. It must nevertheless be ordered according to its own laws; those of the mental or moral Self do not apply to it.We love; that is, we will to unite: then the one must study the other, divine every butterfly thought as it flits, andoffer the flower it most fancies. The vocabulary of Love is small, and its terms are hackneyed; to seek new wordsand phrases is to be affected, stilted. It chills.But the language of the body is never exhausted; one may talk for an hour by means of an eye-lash. There areintimate, delicate things, shadows of the leaves of the Tree of the Soul that dance in the breeze of Love, so subtlethat neither Keats nor Heine in words, neither Brahms nor Debussy in music, could give them body. It is the agonyof every artist, the greater he the more fierce his despair, that he cannot compass expression. And what they cannotdo, not once in a life of ardour, is done in all fulness by the body that, loving, hath learnt the lesson of how to love.Addendum: More generally, any act soever may be used to attain any end soever by the magician who knows how tomake the necessary links.53.

Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee. Butecstasy be thine and joy of earth: ever To me! To me!It is clear that this 'kiss' (i.e. this Book) will regenerate Earth by establishing the Law of Liberty. 'My heart & mytongue' seems a mere phrase of endearment; but has possibly some deep significance which at present escapes me.Heart--the seat of intelligence for the ancient Egyptians. Tongue-- the organ of the Word, corresponding to thePhallus, for which it is often an euphemism. A possible meaning is therefore heart Ra-Hoor Khuit, tongue Thoth. SeeLiber Resh.The second paragraph is perhaps an answer to some unspoken thought of my own that my work was accomplished.No: though I be 'of the princes', with the right to enter into my reward, it is my destiny to continue my Work.*[Inserted footnote: * \"Assuage thee\": satisfy thine aspiration to attainment. \"Absolve thee\": relieve thee from furtherduty.]54.

But thou hast all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in thedark.All previous systems have been sectarian, based on a traditional cosmography both gross and incorrect. Our systemis based on absolute science and philosophy. We have \"all in the clear light,\" that of Reason, because our Mysticismis based on an absolute Scepticism. But at the time of this writing I had very little mystic experience indeed, as myrecord shows. The Fact is that I was far, far from the Grade even of Master of the Temple. So I could not properlyunderstand this Book; how then could I effectively promulgate it? I comprehended but dimly that it contained myWord; for the Grade of Magus then seemed to me unthinkably high above me. Also, let me say that the True Secretsof this Grade (of Magus) are unfathomable and awful beyond all expression; the process of initiation thereto wascontinuous over years, and contained the most sublime mystic experiences--beyond any yet recorded by man--asmere incidents in its terrific Pageant.The \"equation\" is the representation of Truth by Word.It will be noticed that the subject of the verse changes abruptly after the word \"Aum!\" A. C. had thought of this wordat this moment; it was one that he respected a lot, and he had become very agitated in mind since the positiveassertion, in verse 49, that all words were abrogated. But AUM--111--is, in fact, an imperfect hieroglyph, althoughyears were to pass before he understood this. See Liber 4, Part III, Chapter 7, Section 5. There is also a Chapter ofLiber 333 that should, with its Commentary, be carefully studied by serious Aspirants, since the 'Black B rot hers'--of course!--still try to employ the abrogated word in its superannuated meaning, and this is one of the traps of theslaves of 'Because' that Thelemites must avoid. The Chapter is Chapter 54.They understand 'a little'--this may be interpreted as meaning that they understand the meaning of The Fool, Aleph,111, only in a minor way. They are 'fools of men not The Fool. (On the other hand, see 'little', below.)AUM is related to Aleph qabalistically by number--ill in each case. The termination is in \"Death\" in the sense ofMystical Sacrifice, the Dying God, the Witness--M, t he Hanged Man. Since Aum was the Word of Krishna, the mostancient known form of the Dying God (later cynically adopted in the Roman Catholic Pantheon as \"SaintSebastian\"), it is a natural connotation of that Magus's message. It may be difficult for a minor Hindu initiate toabsorb the idea that AUM is, after all, an imperfect hieroglyph. Krishna has been worshipped in India for tenthousand years. But the greatly daring reader may perhaps be willing to admit as a working hypothesis that, afterten thousand years, brutish mankind may have gone a little further in its study of the Universe in which we live!

It is dealt with fully in Liber Aleph.See Chapters 105, 120, 121, 139, 141, 142, 192, 193, 194, 196, 198, 199, 200, 201, 203 among others.I see no harm in revealing the mystery of Tzaddi to 'the wise'; others will hardly understand my explanations."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Tzaddi is the letter of The Emperor, Trump TV, and He is The Star, Trump XVII.

Still in anothersense, the Phallus being God, the House of God is the Kteis, in this case the Empress, Atu III. Beth, the letter of theMagician, also means House, and this is that mystery concerning Sin the Babylonian Moon-God and its influence,that we have already spoken about.Serious students are referred to Book Four, Part III, Chapter IV, the long note on the word ALIM; to the Scholion onLiber Samekh, Book Four, Part III, Appendix IV, Section J; to Liber Aleph, Chapters 173-176, 185; to verses 14-2 1and 34-36 of Liber CCCLXX; and to the Hymn in Liber XV.Also, since Hadit is the highest possible conception of the Phallus, higher even than Yod, it follows that the ultimateHouse of God is Nuit. That is obvious, since you are a star, therefore Hadit, and live in Her! Which brings us backto the first sentence of the verse.58. I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest,ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.These joys are principally (1) the Beatific Vision, in which Beauty is constantly present to the recipient of Her grace,together with a calm and unutterable joy; (2) the Vision of Wonder, in which the whole Mystery of the Universe isconstantly understood and admired for its Ingenium and Wisdom. (1) is referred to Tiphereth, the Grade of Adept;(2) to Binah, the Grade of Master of the Temple.The certainty concerning death is conferred by the Magical Memory, and various Experiences without which Life isunintelligible.\"Peace unutterable\" is given by the Trance in which Matter is destroyed; \"rest\" by that which finally equilibratesMotion.\"Ecstasy\" refers to a Trance which combines these.\"Nor do I demand aught in sacrifice\"--the ritual of worship is Samadhi. But see later, verse 61.The above Commentary is very lofty, and had as its purpose to refute certain critics who pointed out that Nuit gaveor promised \"indecent\" rewards to her worshippers.

My incense is of resinous woods & gums; and there is no blood therein: because of my hair the trees ofEternity.It seems possible that Our Lady describes Her hair as \"the trees of Eternity\" because of the tree-like structure of theCosmos. This is observed in the 'Star-Sponge' Vision. I must explain this by giving a comparatively full account ofthis vision.Readers must not forget that this Commentary was written during the Twenties. Evidently, the Vision came from thecontact of A. C. with AL, and has, since then, refracted itself in the work of many painters, poets, and writers.Particularly science-fiction writers.THE 'STAR-SPONGE' VISIONThere is a Vision of a peculiar character which has been of cardinal importance in my interior life, and to whichconstant reference is made in my magical diaries. So far as I know, there is no extant description of this visionanywhere, and I was surprised on looking through my records to find that I had given no clear account of it myself.The reason apparently is that it is so necessary a part of myself that I unconsciously assume it to be a matter ofcommon knowledge, just as one assumes that everybody knows that one possesses a pair of lungs, and thereforeabstains from mentioning the fact directly, although perhaps alluding to the matter often enough.It appears very essential to describe this vision as well as is possible, considering the difficulty of language, and thefact that the phenomena involve logical contradictions, the conditions of consciousness being other than thoseobtaining normally.The vision developed gradually. It was repeated on so many occasions that I am unable to say at what period it maybe called complete. The beginning, however, is clear enough in my memory.I was on a retirement in a cottage overlooking Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire. I lost consciousness ofeverything but an universal space in which were innumerable bright points, and I realized this as a physicalrepresentation of the Universe, in what I may call its essential structure. I exclaimed: \"Nothingness, with twinkles!\" Iconcentrated upon this vision, with the result that the void space, which had been the principal element of itdiminished in importance; space appeared to be ablaze, yet the radiant points were not confused, and I thereuponcompleted my sentence with the exclamation: \"But what Twinkles!\"The next stage of this vision led to an identification of the blazing points with the stars of the firmament, with ideas,souls, etc. I perceived also that each star was connected by a ray of light with each other star. In the world of ideas,each thought possessed a necessary relation with each other thought; each such relation is of course a thought initself; each such ray is itself a star. It is here that logical difficulty first presents itself. The seer has a directperception of infinite series. Logically, therefore, it would appear as if the entire space must be filled up with ahomogeneous blaze of light. This, however, is not the case. The space is completely full; yet the monads which fill itare perfectly distinct. The ordinary reader might well exclaim that such statements exhibit symptoms of mentalconfusion. The subject demands more than cursory examination. I can do no more than refer the critic to the Hon.Bertrand Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, where the above position is thoroughly justified, as alsocertain positions which follow. At the time I had not read this book; and I regard it as a striking proof of the value ofmystical attainment, that its results should have led a mind such as mine, whose mathematical training was of themost elementary character, to the immediate consciousness of some of the most profound and importantmathematical truths; to the acquisition of the power to think in a manner totally foreign to the normal (Normal, ofcourse, in the sense of average) mind, the rare possession of the greatest thinkers in the world.A further development of the vision brought the consciousness that the structure of the universe was highlyorganized, that certain stars were of greater magnitude and brilliancy than the rest. I began to seek similes to help meto explain myself. Several such attempts are mentioned later in this note. Here again are certain analogies with some"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of the properties of infinite series. The reader must not be shocked at the idea of a number which is not increased byaddition or multiplication, a series of infinite series, each one of which may be twice as long as its predecessor, andso on. There is no \"mystical humbug\" about this. As Mr. Russell shows, truths of this order are more certain than themost universally accepted axioms; in fact, many axioms accepted by the intellect of the average man are not true atall. But in order to appreciate these truths, it is necessary to educate the mind to thought of an order which is at firstsight incompatible with rationality.I may here digress for a moment in order to demonstrate how this vision led directly to the understanding of themechanism of certain phenomena which have hitherto been dismissed with a shrug of the shoulders asincomprehensible.Example No. 1. I began to become aware of my own mental processes; I thought of my consciousness as theCommander-in- Chief of an army. There existed a staff of specialists to deal with various contingencies. There wasan intelligence department to inform me of my environment. There was a council which determined the relativeimportance of the data presented to them--it required only a slight effort of imagination to think of this council as indebate; I could picture to myself some tactically brilliant proposal being vetoed by the Quartermaster-General. It wasonly one step to dramatize the scene, and it flashed upon me in a moment that here was the explanation of 'doublepersonality': that illusion was no more than a natural personification of internal conflict, just as the savage attributesconsciousness to trees and rocks.Example No. 2. While at Montauk I had put my sleeping bag to dry in the sun. When I went to take it in, I remarked,laughingly, \"Your bed-time, Master Bag,\" as if it were a small boy and I its nurse. This was entirely frivolous, butthe thought flashed into my mind that after all the bag was in one sense a part of myself. The two ideas cametogether with a snap, and I understood the machinery of a man's delusion that he is a teapot.These two examples may give some idea to the reader of the light which mystical attainment throws upon the detailsof the working of the human mind.Further developments of this vision emphasized the identity between the Universe and the mind. The search forsimiles deepened. I had a curious impression that the thing I was looking for was somehow obvious and familiar.Ultimately it burst upon me with fulminating conviction that the simile for which I was seeking was the nervoussystem. I exclaimed: \"The mind is the nervous system,\" with all the enthusiasm of Archimedes, and it only dawnedon me later, with a curious burst of laughter at my naivete, that my great discovery amounted to a platitude. (Butthere is a great difference between intellectual awareness of a truth and actual experience of it. It is the differencebetween the man of letters and a sage.)From this I came to another discovery: I perceived why platitudes were stupid. The reason was that they representedthe summing up of trains of thought, each of which was superb in every detail at one time. A platitude was like awife after a few years; she has lost none of her charms, and yet one prefers some perfectly worthless woman.I now found myself able to retrace the paths of thought which ultimately come together in a platitude. I would startwith some few simple ideas and develop them. Each stage in the process was like the joy of a young eagle soaringfrom height to height in ever increasing sunlight as dawn breaks, foaming, over the purple hem of the garment ofocean, and when the many coloured rays of rose and gold and green gathered themselves together and melted intothe orbed glory of the sun, with a rapture that shook the soul with unimaginable ecstasy, that sphere of rushing lightwas recognized as a common-place idea, accepted unquestioningly and treated with drab indifference because it hadso long been assimilated as a natural and necessary part of the order of Nature. At first I was shocked and disgustedto discover that a series of brilliant researches should culminate in a commonplace. But I soon understood that what Ihad done was to live over again the triumphant career of conquering humanity; that I had experienced in my ownperson the succession of winged victories that had been sealed by a treaty of peace whose clauses might be summedup in some such trite expression as \"Beauty depends upon form.\"It would be quite impractical to go fully into the subject of this vision of the Star-Sponge, if only because itsramifications are omniform. It must suffice to reiterate that it has been the basis of most of my work for the last fiveyears, and to remind the reader that the essential form of it is \"Nothingness with twinkles.\"Readers should remember that at the time this was written the techniques of astronomic photography were still in"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"their infancy.

The mummification had as its purpose to delay thedissolution of the Astral Body of the deceased so that as much of it as possible went with him or her in the nextincarnation, thus providing continuity of consciousness through the lives. But this was a gross artifice, not to becompared with Our Way, for which see Liber Aleph, Chapters 192-193. The Book was put in the tomb orsarcophagus because supposedly the owner had used it constantly, which provided a further link.

(Absolutely not. See our note below.) With the establishment of the Law something of this sort may becomepossible. It is only necessary to kill out the sense of 'sin', with its false shame and its fear of nature.P.S. The Gnostic Mass is intended to supply this need. Liber XV. It has been said continuously in California forsome years.A. C. was wrong. The verse states quite clearly: \"as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple.\" The templeis secret. Worship of Nu is reserved for her 'chosen which means, those who love her.On the plane of religions, the influence of the Law consists in making them tolerate each other, so that all men mayworship in the temple or manner of their choice, without interference even from those whose theory of the Universeis utterly contrary to theirs. See Liber OZ, and Chapter 35 of Liber Aleph. Also, the atheist has as much right to hisopinion as anybody else, and perhaps more: \"There is no God where I am.\"Liber XV was read in California for several years, the Mass was performed, and interviews were given to reporters,who referred to that particular group as \"The Purple Cult.\" It was indeed purple, and perhaps a bit too voluptuous.Love must be under will, and the word of the Law is THELEMA, not AGAPE!There is another reason, and a very important one, why the temple must be secret. It is best if it is located in a cave,or at least surrounded by very thick walls. For nowadays, radiation of all types interferes with \"Orgonic light.\" ThePyramids were specially built having Star Presence in mind; if conditions demanded such a shield to normalradiation then, how much more necessary now!Readers must not mistake our meaning when we say that radiation of all types interferes with Starlight. Of course,Starlight is too subtle--\"faint & faery\"--to be interfered with even by atomic radiation. It is our organisms that,under the constant bombardment of radiation from grosser sources--noise, radio, TV, subsonics, etc,--becomeunable to perceive, and attune themselves to, Her Presence. It is not for nothing that Nuit recommends that weworship her at night and in the desert!63. Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for I loveyou! I love you!All those acts which excite the divine in man are proper to the Rite of Invocation.Religion, as understood by the vile, is the very opposite of all this. He--it--seems to wish to kill his--its--soul byforbidding every expression of it, and every practice which might awaken it to expression. (True. For the awakeningof the soul means change, under which the present form and condition of the ego must 'die'. Fearing this death, theyconfirm themselves in stagnation and resist change. This is an effect of the telepathic 'radiation' of the 'BlackBrothers'.) To hell with this Verbotenism!In particular, let me exhort all men and all women, for they are Stars! Heed well this holy Verse!True Religion is intoxication, in a sense. We are told elsewhere to intoxicate the innermost, not the outermost; but Ithink that the word \"wine\" should be taken in its widest sense as meaning that which brings out the soul. Climate,soil, and race change conditions; each man or woman must find and choose the fit intoxicant. Thus hashish in one oranother of its forms seems to suit the Moslem, to go with dry heat; opium is right for the Mongol; whiskey for thedour temperament and damp cold climate of the Scot.Sex-expression, too, depends on climate and so on, so that we must interpret the Law to suit a Socrates, a Jesus, anda Burton, or a Marie Antoinette and a de Lamballe, as well as our own Don Juans and Faustines.With this expansion, to the honour and glory of Them, of Their Natures, we acclaim therefore our helpers, Dionysus,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Aphrodite, Apollo, Wine, Woman and Song.Intoxication, that is, ecstasy, is the key to Reality. It is explained in \"Energized Enthusiasm\" (Equinox I, IX) thatthere are three Gods whose function is to bring the Soul to the Realization of its own glory: Dionysus, Aphrodite,Apollo; Wine, Woman, and Song.The ancients, both in the highest civilizations, as in Greece and Egypt, and in the most primitive savagery, as amongthe Buriats and the Papuans, were well aware of this, and made their religious ceremonies 'orgia', Works. 'Christian'foulness, failing to understand what was happening, degraded the word 'orgies' to mean debauches. It is the old storyof the fox who lost his tail. If you cannot do anything, call it impossible; or, if it is evidently absurd that it should beimpossible, call it wicked!It is critics who deny poetry, people without capacity for Ecstasy and Will who call Mysticism moonshine andMagick delusion. It is manless old cats, geldings, and psychopaths, who pretend to detest Love, and persecute FreeWomen and Free Men.Verbotenism has gone so far in certain slave communities that the use of wine is actually prohibited by law! (Thiswas written during the 'dry law' in America.)I wish here to emphasize that the Law of Thelema definitely enjoins us, as a necessary act of religion, to \"drinksweet wines and wines that foam.\" Any free man or woman who resides in any community where this is verbotenhas a choice between two duties: insurrection and emigration.The furtive disregard of Restriction is not Freedom. It tends to make men slaves and hypocrites, and to destroyrespect for Law. (The only result of the 'dry law' was the Syndicate.)Have no fear: two years after Vodka was verboten, Russia, which had endured a thousand lesser tyrannies withpatience, rose in Revolution.Religious ecstasy is necessary to man's soul. Where this is attained by mystical practices, directly, as it should be,people need no substitutes. Thus, the Hindus remain contentedly sober, and care nothing for the series of Invaderswho have occupied their country from time to time and governed them. But where the only means of obtaining thisecstasy, or a simulacrum of it, known to the people, is alcohol, they must have alcohol. Deprive them of wine, orbeer, or whatever their natural drink maybe, and they replace it by morphia, cocaine, or something easier to conceal,and to take without detection.Stop that, and it is Revolution. As long as a man can get rid of his surplus Energy in enjoyment, he finds life easy,and submits. Deprive him of Pleasure, of Ecstasy, and his mind begins to worry about the way in which he isexploited and oppressed. Very soon he begins furtively to throw bombs; and, gathering strength, to send his tyrantsto the gallows.64.

The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"~ The Commentaries of AL ~1. Chapter IIBeing the core of the Equinox Vol. V no. 1by Motta1. Nu! the hiding of Hadit.We see again set forth the complementary character of Nuit and Hadit. Nu conceals Had because He is Everywherein the Infinite, and She manifests Him for the same reason. (See verse 3.) Every Individual manifests the Whole; andthe Whole conceals every Individual. The Soul interprets the Universe; and the Universe veils the Soul. Natureunderstands Herself by becoming self-conscious in Her units; and the Consciousness loses its sense of separatenessby dissolution in Her.There has been much difficulty in the orthography (in sacred languages) of these names. Nu is clearly stated to be56, NV; but Had is only hinted obscurely. This matter is discussed later more fully; verses 15 and 16.2. Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I, Hadit, am the complement of Nu, mybride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the name of my House.Khabs — 'a star' — is an unit of Nuit, and therefore Nuit Herself. This doctrine is enormously difficult ofapprehension, even after these many years of study.Hadit is the \"core of every star\", (verse 6). He is thus the Impersonal Identity within the Individuality of \"every manand every woman\".He is \"not extended\"; that is, without condition of any sort in the metaphysical sense. Only in the highest trances canthe nature of these truths be realized. It is indeed a suprarational experience not dissimilar to those characteristic ofthe \"Star-Sponge\" Vision previously described that can help us here. The trouble is that the truth itself is unfitted tothe dualistic reason of 'normal' mankind. Hadit seems to be the principle of Motion which is everywhere, yet is notextended in any dimension except as it chances to combine with the 'Matter' which is Nuit. There can evidently beno manifestation apart from this conjunction. A \"Khabs\" or Star is apparently any nucleus where this conjunction hastaken place. The real philosophical difficulty about this cosmogony is not concerned with any particular equation, oreven with the Original Equation. We can understand x=ab, x=a,b,&c; and, also, 0°=pa qb, whether pa-qb=O or not.But we ask how the homogeneity of both Nuit and Hadit can ever lead to even the illusion of 'difference'. Theanswer appears to be that this difference appears naturally with the self-realization of Nuit as the totality ofpossibilities; each of these, singly and in combination, is satisfied or set in motion by Hadit, to compose a particularmanifestation. 0° could possess no signification at all, unless there were diverse dimensions wherein it had noextension. 'Nothing' means nothing save from the point of view of 'Two', just as 'Two' is monstrous unless it is seenas a mode of 'Nothing'.The above explanation appears somewhat disingenuous, since there is no means whatever of distinguishing anyUnion H x N = R from another. We must postulate a further stage.R (Ra-Hoor-Khuit), Kether, Unity, is always itself; but we may suppose that a number of such homogeneous positivemanifestations may form groups differing from each other as to size and structure so as to create the illusion ofdiversity.3. In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found.This is again interesting as throwing light on the thesis: \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" There is no placesoever that is not a Centre of Light."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"This Truth is to be realized by direct perception, not merely by intellection. It is axiomatic; it cannot bedemonstrated. It is to be assimilated by experience of the Vision of the \"Star-Sponge\".4. Yet she shall be known & I never.See later, verse 13, \"Thou (i.e., the Beast, who is here the Mask, or 'persona', of Hadit) wast the knower\". Haditpossesses the power to know, Nuit that of being known. Nuit is not unconnected with the idea of Nibbana, the'Shoreless Sea' in which Knowledge is Not.Hadit is hidden in Nuit, and knows Her, She being an object of knowledge; but He is not knowable, for He is merelythat part of Her which She formulates in order that She may be known.5. Behold! the rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be cast away; let the good ones be purged bythe prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go aright.The \"old time\" is the Aeon of the Dying God. Some of its rituals are founded on an utterly false metaphysics andcosmogony; but others are based on Truth. We end those, and mend these.This \"Knowledge\" is the initiated Wisdom of this Aeon of Horus.See Book 4, Part III, for an account of the new principles of Magick.Note that Knowledge is Daath, Child of Chokhmah by Binah, and crown of Microprosopus; yet he is not one of theSephiroth, and his place is in the Abyss. By this symbolism we draw attention to the fact that Knowledge is bynature impossible; for it implies Duality, and is therefore relative. Any proposition of Knowledge may be written'ARB': 'A has the relation R to B'. Now if A and B are identical, the proposition conveys no knowledge at all. If A isnot identical with B, ARB implies 'A is identical with BC'; this assumes that not less than three distinct ideas exist.In every case, we must proceed either to the identity which means ultimately 'Nothing', or to divergent diversitieswhich only seem to mean something so long as we refrain from pushing the analysis of any term to its logicalelements. For example, 'sugar is sugar' is obviously not knowledge. But no more is this: \"Sugar is a sweet crystallinecarbohydrate.\" For each of these four terms describes a sensory impression on ourselves; and we define ourimpressions only in terms of such things as sugar. Thus 'sweet' means 'the quality ascribed by our taste to honey,sugar, etc.'; 'white' is 'what champaks, zinc oxide, sugar, etc., report to our eyesight'; and so on. The proposition isultimately an identity, for all our attempts to evade the issue by creating complications. 'Knowledge' is therefore nota 'thing-in-itself'; it is rightly denied a place upon the Tree of Life; it pertains to the Abyss.Besides the above considerations, it may be observed that Knowledge, so far as it exists at all, even as a statement ofrelation, is no more than a momentary phenomenon of consciousness. It is annihilated in the instant of its creation.For no sooner do we assent to ARB than ARB is absorbed in our conception of A. After the nine- days' wonder of'The earth revolves around the sun', we modify our former ideas of Earth. 'Earth' is intuitively classed with othersolar satellites. The proposition vanishes automatically as it is assimilated. Knowledge, while it exists as such, isconsequently sub judice, at the best.What then may we understand by this verse, with its capital K for 'Knowledge'? What is it, and how shall it \"goaright\"? The key is in the word \"go\". It cannot 'be', as we have seen above; it is the fundamental error of the 'BlackBrothers' in their policy of resisting all Change, to try to maintain it as fixed and absolute. But (as the Tree of Lifeindicates) Knowledge is the means by which the conscious mind, Microprosopus, reaches to Understanding and toWisdom, its mother and father, which reflect respectively Nuit and Hadit from the Ain and Kether. The process is touse each new item of knowledge to correct and increase one's comprehension of the Subject of the Proposition. ThusARB should tell us: A is (not A, as we supposed) but A. This facilitates the discovery ARC leading to A is A2 and soon. In practice, every thing that we learn about (e.g.) 'horse' helps us to understand — to enjoy — the idea. Thedifference between the scholar and the schoolboy is that the former glows and exults when he is reminded of someword like 'Thalassa'. Ourselves: What a pageant of passion empurples our minds whenever we think of the number93! Most of all, each new thing that we know about ourselves helps us to realize what we mean by our \"Star\".Now, \"the rituals of the old time\" are no longer valid vehicles; Knowledge cannot \"go aright\" until they are adaptedto the Formula of the New Aeon. Their defects are due principally to two radical errors. (1): The Universe was"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"conceived as possessing a fixed centre, or summit; an absolute standard to which all things might be referred; anUnity, or God. (Mystics were angry and bewildered, often enough, when attaining to 'union with God' they foundhim equally in all.) This led to making a difference between one thing and another, and so to the ideas of superiority,of sin, etc., ending in absurdities of all kinds, alike in theology, ethics, and science. (2): The absolute antithesisbetween the pairs of opposites. This is really a corollary of (1). There was an imaginary 'absolute evil' which madeManichaeism necessary—despite the cloaks of the Casuists—and meant 'That which leads one away from God'. Buteach man, while postulating an absolute 'God', defined Him unconsciously in terms of Freudian Phantasm created byhis own wish-fulfilment machinery. Thus 'Good' and 'Evil' were really expressions of personal prejudice. A man who'bowed humbly to the Authority of' the Pope, or the Bible, or the Sanhedrim, or the Oracle of Apollo, or the tribalMedicine- Man, none the less expressed truly his own Wish to abdicate responsibility. In the light of this Book, wenow know that the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere; that \"Every man and every woman is a star\", a'Khabs' the name of the house of Hadit; that \"The word of Sin is Restriction\". To us, then, 'evil' is a relative term; itis 'that which hinders one from fulfilling his true Will.' (E.g., rain is 'good' or 'bad' for the farmer according to therequirements of his crops.)The Osirian Rituals inculcating self-sacrifice to an abstract idea, mutilation to appease an ex cathedra morality,fidelity to a priori formulae, etc., teach false and futile methods of acquiring false knowledge; they must be 'castaway' or 'purged'. The Schools of Initiation must be reformed.This is being done despite the howling and gnashing of teeth, and will go on until the whole mess is cleaned up.6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star. I am Life, and the giver ofLife, yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.It follows that, as Hadit can never be known, there is no death. (Except in the Initiatic sense —and very much so inthis sense, dear 'Black Brethren'!) The death of the individual is his awakening to the impersonal immortality ofHadit. This applies less to physical death than to the Crossing of the Abyss; for which see Liber 418, FourteenthAethyr. One may attain to be aware that one is but a particular 'child' of the Play of Hadit and Nuit; one's personalityis then perceived as being a disguise. It is not only not a living thing, as one had thought; but a mere symbol withoutsubstance, incapable of life. It is the conventional form of a certain cluster of thoughts, themselves the partial andhieroglyphic symbols of an 'ego'. The conscious and sensible 'man' is to his Self just what the printed letters on thispage are to me who have caused them to manifest in colour and form. They are arbitrary devices for conveying mythought; I could use French or Greek just as well. Nor is this thought, here conveyed, more than one ray of my Orb;and even that whole Orb is but the garment of Me. The analogy is precise; therefore when one becomes 'the knower'it involves the 'death' of all sense of the Ego. One perceives one's personality precisely as I now do these printedletters; and they are forgotten, just as, absorbed in my thought, the trained automatism of my mind and bodyexpresses that thought in writing, without attention on my part, still less with identification of the extremes involvedin the process.7. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. \"Come unto me\"is a foolish word: for it is I that go.\"It is I that go.\" Liber Aleph must be consulted for a full demonstration of this truth. We may here say briefly thatHadit is Motion, that is, Change or 'Love'. The symbol of Godhead in Egypt was the Ankh, which is a sandal-strap,implying the Power to Go; and it suggests the Rosy Cross, the Fulfilment of Love, by its shape.The Wheel and the Circle are evidently symbols of Nuit; this sentence insists upon the conception of Lingam-Yoni.But beyond the obvious relation, we observe two geometrical definitions. The axle is a cylinder set perpendicularlyto the plane of the wheel; thus Hadit supplies the third dimension to Nuit. It suggests that Matter is to be conceivedas Two-Dimensional; that is, perhaps, as possessed of two qualities, extension and potentiality. To these Hadit bringsmotion and position. The wheel moves; manifestation now is possible. Its perception implies three-dimensionalspace, and time. But note that the Mover is himself not moved. The 'cube in the circle' emphasizes this question ofdimension. The cube is rectilinear (therefore phallic no less than the axle); its unity suggests perfection projected as a'solid' for human perception; its square faces affirm balance, equity, and limitation; its six-sidedness sets it amongthe solar symbols. It is thus like the Sun in the Zodiac, which is no more than the field for His fulfilment in Hisgoing. He, by virtue of his successive relation with each degree of the circle, clothes Himself with an appearance of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"'Matter in Motion', although absolute motion through space is a meaningless expression (Eddington, Space, Timeand Gravitation). None the less, every point in the cube—there are 2 of them — has an unique relation with everypoint in the circle exactly balanced against an equal and opposite relation. We have thus Matter that both is and isnot, Motion that both moves and moves not, interacting in a variety of ways which is infinite to manifest individuals,each of which is unlike any other, yet is symmetrically supported by its counterpart. Note that even at the centre ofgravity of the cube no two rays are identical except in mere length. They differ as to their point of contact with thecircle, their right ascension, and their relation with the other points of the cube.Why is Nuit restricted to two dimensions? We usually think of space as a sphere. \"None—and two\"; extension andpotentiality are Her only projections of Naught. It is strange, by the way, to find that modern mathematics says\"Spherical space is not very easy to imagine\" (Eddington, Op. cit., p. 158) and prefers to attribute a geometrical formwhose resemblance to the Kteis is most striking. For Nuit is, philosophically speaking, the archetype of the Kteis,giving appropriate Form to all Being, and offering every possibility of fulfilment to every several point that itenvelops. But Nuit cannot be symbolized as three-dimensional, in our system; each unit has position by three spatial,and one temporal, coordinates. It cannot exist, in our consciousness, with less as a reality. Each 'individual' must be a'point-interval'; he must be the product of some part of the Matter of Nuit (with special possibilities) and of theMotion of Hadit (with special energies) determined in space by his relations with his neighbours, and in time by hisrelations with himself.It is evidently \"a foolish word\" for Hadit to say \"Come unto me\", as did Nuit naturally enough, meaning \"Fulfil thypossibilities\"; for who can 'come unto' Motion itself, who draw near unto that which is in very truth his innermostidentity?Some technical aspects of this verse had better be pointed out. \"I am the Magician and the Exorcist\": in any 'War',He is both sides. Whichever wins, if the victor wins by True Will, (we except here such 'Wars' as are caused by twopeople interfering with each other, both ignorant of their True Will) wins by Universal Necessity. Hadit, therefore,does not 'know' 'the fallen' Hadit knows only 'success; meaning: the acting out of the True Law of one's being. Inorder for Had it to manifest Himself in the 'knower; that is, in the Ruach, it is necessary that the Ruach be attuned tothe Higher Triad —in which case 'failure; 'fear' and 'sorrow' become impossible. These things exist in terms ofrelations, but not as 'Absolutes'\"Come unto me\" is a 'foolish word'—see our Commentary to AL I, 11—is a direct condemnation of 'BlackBrotherhood', that is ,Imperfect Initiation. The 'Black Brother' opens his arms to his fellow men and cries out,\"Come unto me, ye who suffer, and be consoled!\" He does this by the unbalance of his Ego. He has received asufficient influx of Magick Force to 'feel good; and his spiritual pride infuses him with pity for his fellow beings,particularly his own species. He wants to console' them. In point of fact, however, he will enslave them, for he isunable to see their true nature at all. If he could see it, he would understand what Hadit means by statingcategorically: \"it is I that go.\"Try to remember that your neighbour does not need your pity. He may, at the most, need your respect. Because ifyou respect him, you stop meddling in his affairs!8. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper.Again Hadit (Aiwass speaking for Him, of course!) lays down the Law in no uncertain manner. He is Heru-pa-kraath, and who worships Him is doing ill, not only to himself or herself, but to mankind as a whole. \"I am theworshipper\".Harpocrates is also the Dwarf-Soul the Secret Self of every man, the Serpent with the Lion's Head. Now, Haditknows Nuit by virtue of his 'Going' or 'Love'. It is therefore wrong to worship Hadit; one is to be Hadit, and worshipHer. This is clear even from His instruction \"To worship me\" in verse 22 of this chapter. Confer Cap. I, verse 9. Weare exhorted to offer ourselves unto Nuit, pilgrims to all her temples. It is bad Magick to admit that one is other thanOne's inmost self. One should plunge passionately into every possible experience; by doing so, one is purged ofthose personal prejudices which we took so stupidly for ourselves, though they prevented us from realizing our trueWills and from knowing our Names and Natures. The Aspirant must well understand that it is no paradox to say thatthe Annihilation of the Ego in the Abyss is the condition of emancipating the true Self, and exalting it tounimaginable heights. So long as one remains one's self' one is overwhelmed by the Universe; destroy the sense of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"self, and every event is equally an expression of one's Will, since its occurrence is the resultant of the concourse ofthe forces which one recognizes as one s own.9. Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass & are done;but there is that which remains.This verse is very thoroughly explained in Liber Aleph. \"All in this kind are but shadows,\" says Shakespeare,referring to actors. The Universe is a Puppet-Play for the amusement of Nuit and Hadit in their Nuptials; a veryMidsummer Night's Dream. So then we laugh at the mock woes of Pyramus and Thisbe, the clumsy gambols ofBottom; for we understand the Truth of Things, how all is a Dance of Ecstasy. \"Were the world understood, Yewould know it was good, A dance to a lyrical measure!\" The nature of events must be 'pure joy'; for, obviously,whatever occurs is the fulfilment of the Will of its master. (This is true even when what occurs is apparently theresult of a Diseased Will at work, as a 'Black Brother' . For the 'Black Brother' bows his neck to Choronzon. SeeLiber Aleph, Ch. 166) Sorrow thus appears as the result of any unsuccessful — therefore, ill-judged — struggle.Acquiescence in the order of Nature is the ultimate Wisdom.One must understand the Universe perfectly, and be utterly indifferent to its pressure. These are the virtues whichconstitute a Master of the Temple. Yet each man must act what he will; for he is energized by his own nature. Solong as he works \"without lust of result\" and does his duty for its own sake, he will know that \"the sorrows are butshadows\". And he himself is \"that which remains\"; for he can no more be destroyed, or his true Will be thwarted,than Matter diminish or Energy disappear. He is a necessary Unit of the Universe, equal and opposite to the sumtotal of all the others; and his Will is similarly the final factor which completes the equilibrium of the dynamicalequation. He cannot fail if he would; thus, his sorrows are but shadows—he could not see them if he kept his gazefixed on his goal, the Sun.The above is neither 'philosophy' nor 'consolation'; it is a fact; but the assimilation of this fact is the result of aTrance, or rather, a succession of Trances. See Liber Aleph, Chapters 7-3 1, 36-3 7, 46, 53, 57.It must be stressed once more that Hadit does not \"know\" people who are not yet conscious of, and doing their. TrueWills, and that such people are included in the category of 'shadows' The sensation of \"That was a narrow escape!\"that Initiates have at the moment of death comes from the Ruach's intuitive perception that \"this time\" it almost, justnot quite, severed its connection with the Higher Triad. The danger of any incarnation is this. And perhaps one of itsattractions? . .. See LXV, ii, vv. 3-6; iii, vv. 30-33; iv, vv. 18-2 1, 42- 47; v, vv. 8-10.10. 0 prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.As related in Book Four, Part IV, and Equinox I, vii, I was at the time of this revelation a rationalistic Buddhist, veryconvinced of the First Noble Truth: \"Everything is Sorrow.\" I supposed this point of view to be an absolute and finaltruth — as if Apemantus were the only character in Shakespeare!It is also explained in that place how I was prepared for this Work by that period of Dryness. If I had been insympathy with it, my personality would have interfered. I should have tried to better my instructions.See, in Liber 418, the series of visions by which I actually transcended Sorrow. But the considerations set forth inthe comment on verse 9 lead to a simpler, purer, and more perfect attainment for those who can assimilate them inthe subconscious mind by the process described in the comment on verse 6.It may encourage certain types of aspirant if I emphasize my personal position. AIWAZ made no mistake when hespoke this verse — and the triumphant contempt of his tone still rings in my ear! After seventeen years ofunparalleled spiritual progress, of unimaginably intense ecstasies, of beatitudes prolonged for whole months, ofinitiations indescribably exalted, of proof piled on proof of His power, His vigilance, His love, after being protectedand energized with incredible aptness, I find myself still only too ready to grumble, nay, even to doubt. It seems as ifI resented the whole business. There are times when I feel that the amoeba, the bourgeois, and the cow represent theABC of enviable creatures. There may be a melancholy strain in me, as one might expect in a case of renal weaknesssuch as mine.In any event, it is surely a most overwhelming proof that AIWAZ is not myself, but my master, that He could force"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"me to write verse 9, at a time when I was both intellectually and spiritually disgusted with, and despairing of, theUniverse, as well as physically alarmed about my health.11. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger.This compulsion was that of true inspiration. It was the Karma of countless incarnations of struggle towards thelight. There is a sharp revulsion, physical and mental, toward any initiation, like that towards death.The above paragraph states only a part of the truth. I am not sure that it is not an attempt to explain away the verse,which humiliates me. I remember clearly enough the impulse to refuse to go on, and the fierce resentment at therefusal of my muscles to obey me. Reflect that I was being compelled to make an abject recantation of practicallyevery article of my creed, and I had not even Cranmer's excuse. I was proud of my personal prowess as a poet,hunter, and mountaineer of admittedly dauntless virility; yet I was being treated like a hypnotized imbecile, onlyworse, for I was perfectly aware of what I was doing.12. Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not.The use of capitals \"Me\" and \"Thee\" emphasizes that Hadit was wholly manifested in The Beast. (On the contrary.As readers will notice, \"Me\" is not in capitals in the text, only \"Thee\" It is not Hadit, but Aiwass, who is speaking.He is saying that he was manifested in the Higher Triad of Crowley, and that Crowley's Ruach —the lower \"I\" —was not conscious of this. Aiwass, being an Ipsissimus, is manifested in any Higher Triad; also, not being a 'BlackBrother; He knows that He can manifest himself in another's Higher Triad only as part of that Higher Triad'sconsciousness. The Centre of any Higher Triad's consciousness is Its Point-of-View — Hadit. And Hadit \"is alone\".There is no God where He is. This very difficult point remains obscure without Initiatic Experience, but 666 hadenough even at the time of writing this Commentary to explain the situation more clearly. That He fails to do so isproof of how much his conscious Ego —Aleister Crowley — was upset still by the experience.) It is to beremembered that The Beast had agreed to follow the instructions communicated to Him (Through his wife Rose.)only in order to show that 'nothing would happen if you broke all the rules.' Poor fool! The Way of Mastery is tobreak all the rules—but you have to know them perfectly before you can do this; otherwise you are not in a positionto transcend them.Aiwaz here explains that his power over me depended upon the fact that Hadit is verily \"the core of every star\". As iswell known, there is a limit to the power of the hypnotist; he cannot overcome the resistance of the Unconscious ofhis patient. My own Unconscious was thus in alliance with Aiwaz; taken between two fires, my conscious self wasparalyzed so long as the pressure lasted. It will be seen later—verses 61 to 69— that my consciousness wasultimately invaded by the Secret Self, and surrendered unconditionally, so that it proclaimed, loudly and gladly, fromits citadel, the victory of its rightful Lord. The mystery is indeed this, that in so prosperous and joyous a city thereshould still be groups of malcontents whose grumblings are occasionally audible. (Such malcontents are often notpart of one 's own personality, but people who may be on the other side of the world, yet who have Karmic ties withus. This is one of the manners in which the Achievements of the Initiate benefit his fellowmen.)13. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.A.C. asked mentally \"why he didn't know'; and Aiwass explains that A.C. was functioning only in his personality andin Aiwass's Presence in him — Readers must not forget that Aiwass was Crowley's Holy Guardian Angel.Hadit had to overcome the silly \"knower\" (Again, error. It isn't Hadit—it's Aiwass. And this was a very special case.Were it not for the fact that Hadit-Aiwass and Hadit-Beast were in close harmony, Aiwass would never haveinterfered in A. C. 's personality — the \"scribe\". This case is analogous to cases of \"rape\" where there is a genuineattraction between the man and the woman, but it is masked by complexes or prejudices. Only the aftereffects of theact will prove whether it was \"moral\" or not. This is the 'reason' why Adepts often seem to act with completecallousness and lack of consideration for other people's feelings. Please do not confuse 'Adepts' with 'BlackBrethren; though!), who thought everything was Sorrow. Cf. \"Who am I?\" — \"Thou knowest\" in Chapter I. (Analtogether different case. A. C. was asking what Star was he, and the Goddess answered that he already knew — hewas 666. Again the injured feelings of 666's personality cause confusion! ... This is all to the good, though, since itprovides us with an example of the relationship between an Adept's Higher Triad, His Instrument, and His HolyGuardian Angel!)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"I am far from satisfied with either of the above interpretations of this verse. We shall see a little later, vv. 27 et seq.,a general objection to \"Because\" and \"why\". Then how is it that Hadit does not disdain to use those terms? It must befor the sake of my mind. Then, \"for why\" is detestably vulgar; and no straining of grammar excuses or explains the\"me\".We have two alternatives. The verse may be an insult to me. (The personality speaking!. . .) My memory tells me,however, that the tone of the voice of Aiwaz was at this point low, even, and musical. It sounded like a confidential,almost deferential, clarification of the previous verse, which had rung out with joyful crescendo.The alternative is that the verse contains some Qabalistic proof of the authority of Aiwaz to lay down the law in soautocratic a manner. Just so, one might add weight to one's quotation from Sappho, in the English, by following it upwith the original Greek.The absence of all capital letters favours this theory. Such explanation, if discovered, will be given in the Appendix.However, simply enough, the solution begins with the idea that the small initial of 'because' would be explained by acolon preceding it instead of a note of interrogation, which may have been due to my haste,ignorance, andcarelessness. Then \"for why\" may be understood: \"for the benefit of this Mr. Why— to satisfy your childish clamourfor a reason— I will now repeat my remarks in an alternative form such that even your stupidity can scarcely fail toobserve that I have sealed my psychological explanation in cipher.\" We find accordingly that the arising \"of Me inThee\" (he persists in the error) constitutes a state wherein \"thou knewest not\". By \"knewest\" we may understand thefunction of Hadit (still he persists!), intellectually and conjugally united with Nuit. See Book 4, Part III, for GN, theroot meaning both 'to know' and 'to beget'. (This is better.) And 'not' is Nuit (But Hadit is at pains to state that He isNot! Hadit and Nuit are complementary.), as in Cap. I. Now this idea explains that the arising \"of me (Hadit) in Thee(the Beast)\" is the fulfilment of the Magical Formula of Hadit and Nuit. (He gets more and more entangled in hisown reasoning. Clearly, the writing down of this passage of Liber AL was a very humiliating experience for AleisterCrowley.) And to know Nuit is the very definition of 'joy'. The next verse confirms this: \"thou (the Beast) wast theknower (Hadit) and (united with) me (Nuit, as in Cap. I, verse 51 & others).\" Finally, Nuit is indicated by the twodifferent symbols 'not' (Greek OU) and 'me' (Greek MH). Now, OU MH was my Motto in the Grade of AdeptusExemptus; Aiwaz thus subtly reminds me that I was pledged to deny the assertions of my intellectual and moralconsciousness. (This last simply proves that the \"rape\" by Aiwass of the mind of Aleister Crowley was the result ofthe formulated Aspiration of this mind to be raped ... Otherwise, Aiwass would not have done it. It can never bestated too clearly that True Initiates never interfere with the True Will of the least and weakest [senseless expressionfrom above the Abyss, but!] ... human being.)He combines in these few words (a) a correct psychological explanation of the situation (he does), (b) a correctmagical explanation of that explanation (ibidem), (c) a personal rebuke (not so — a reminder. He interprets it asrebuke because the Ego is still resentful) to which I had no possible reply, involving a knowledge of my own mentalstate which was superior to my own.These two verses are sufficient in themselves to demonstrate the praeter-human qualities of the Author of this Book.(On the contrary, they demonstrate that the Author is of our species, though one of its most highly evolved members.Obviously, He was one of the first specimens of the race to achieve consciousness. Aiwass is human — it is we who aren't.)14. Now let there be a veiling of this shrine: now let the light devour men and eat them up with blindness!The subject changes. Hadit will give an Exordium upon Himself in the next two verses. Then He will propound anethical doctrine so terrible and strange that men will be \"devoured and eaten up with blindness\" because of it.Serious readers should consult Libri LXV and VII on this light that\"devours men and eats them up with blindness.\" Particularly LXV,4 12-19, 24; ii, 30-32; iv, 54-55, 65; and VII, iv, 8-15, 25,48-49; vi, 20-25, 47; vii, 28-33, 3 6-44.15. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one ineight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Readers should consult AL I, 45-48 and the Commentaries thereof for \"perfect, being Not\"; also, the analysis of theWord LAShTAL in Liber V; also, LXV, ii, 26.For \"nine by the fools,\" they should consult Atu IX and Atu XI (Atu XI because Teth has the value 9 in the Qabalah).\"By the fools\" has, of course, a double meaning. Jesod is the Ninth Sephirah, and its symbolism and the Ordeals ofthe Zelator should be considered.For \"eight and one in eight with the just\" they should study the meaning of Atu VII, because Cheth is 8 by theQabalah; of Aleph, because Aleph is 1 by the Qabalah; of Atu I and of Atu VIII.Serious students should never forget that those symbols all run into each other, and that particularly in the case of\"eight, and one in eight.\" It should be noted that first \"eight\" is considered by itself; then, with \"one\" in it.\"The Empress and the King are not of me\". His name could not be written HD (HaD), as Crowley thought at thetime of the dictation,because He is not the \"King\", that is, the Emperor. See AL I, 57, the Second Paragraph, and A.C. 's Commentary thereunto.16. I am The Empress & the Hierophant. Thus eleven, as my bride is eleven.Please notice that \"The Empress\" is written with capitals. In the previous verse the sentence starts after a period, soit is natural for the The of Empress to be in the uppercase. In this verse, there is no reason for The to be capitalizedunless there is a hidden meaning. There is no other instance in the entire manuscript of the definite article beingcapitalized unless it starts a sentence. Hadit is emphasizing that this is a \"greater Empress\" that he is talking about.This is of course He, the Star, who is not the King as A. C. thought at the time. Hadit then means simply that hisname can be written HV, \"The Empress & the Hierophant\". The value, of course, is 11.It should be noted that \"Hu\" was the oldest name that the Egyptians ascribed to the Sphinx at Gizeh. The wordmeans Prince.17. Hear me, ye people of sighing!The sorrows of pain and regretAre left to the dead and the dying, The folk that not know me as yet.To know Hadit only as 'not' is to be able to experience one's own starry identity only through physical death. It cannever be too clearly understood that only the Initiate can infuse the Ruach with the Influence of the Supernals. Thosewho call themselves Initiates and yet speak of the need of \"pain\", and \"suffering\", and \"meek resignation\" in thisworld to gain a \"better life elsewhere\" are merely puppets of the tyrants of religion, finance, or politics. In thissense, undoubtedly, religion is the opium of the masses. Let us keep the lambs uninstructed, lest they perceive thattheir sorrows are not decreed by Divine Providence, but are merely the consequence of our oppression.\" — as yet.\" This is clearly enheartening. This folk will come to know Hadit —that is, Themselves. That's why ALwas dictated, so they would emancipate themselves. And that's why all the resources of propaganda were turnedagainst Crowley in his lifetime everywhere. The death-knell of superstition and privilege was being tolled, and the'Black Brethren' didn't like the sound at all.The dead and the dying, who know not Hadit, are under the illusion of Sorrow. Not being Hadit, they are shadows,puppets, and what happens to them does not matter. If you insist upon identifying yourself with Hecuba, your tearsare natural enough.There is no contradiction here, by the way, with verses 4 and 5. The words \"know me\" are used loosely as is naturalin a stanza; or, more likely, are used (as in the English Bible) to suggest the root GN, identity in transcendentalecstasy. Possibly \"not\" and \"me\" are once more intended to apply to Nuit. With \"know\" itself, they may be 'Nothingunder its three forms' or negativity, action, and individuality.18. These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor and sad: the lords of the earth are ourkinsfolk.This idea is confirmed. Those who sorrow are not real people at all, not 'stars'—for the time being. The fact of their"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"being \"poor and sad\" proves them to be 'shadows', who 'pass and are done'. The \"lords of the earth\" are those whoare doing their Will. It does not necessarily mean people with coronets and automobiles; there are plenty of suchpeople who are the most sorrowful slaves in the world. The sole test of one's lordship is to know what one's true Willis, and to do it.It is rather difficult for the profane to understand that our material conditions are the direct consequence of ourpsychological structure, but such is in fact the case. It is useless to try to change the surroundings of the poor;unless they are \"kings in disguise\" — see verse 58 — they will immediately start modifying their improvedsurroundings to fit their inner state. If you put a pig to live in a palace, the pig will turn the palace into a pigsty. Thesimile is strong, but not exaggerated. Examples abound in the history of revolutions, from the French down to theRussian and beyond.If you want to change a man's living conditions, you must educate the man, provided he is capable of beingeducated. Once educated, he will soon change his surroundings by his own powers.The oppression of tyrants is no argument against the above truth. No tyrant will ever coerce a free man. The most hecan do is kill him —before he is killed, as he undoubtedly will be if he does not leave the free man — the \"star\" —alone.\"We are not for the poor and sad.\" The poor and sad are not conscious of the Triad Nuit-Hadit-Hoor in theirintellect. See Liber V for the meaning of \"not\" —LA.\"The lords of the earth are our kinsfolk,\" Not the \"Lords of the poor and sad\"! These are the 'Black Brothers'. Thelords of the earth are those who have control over their surroundings, over the material site of their 'existence'. Thatis, the true men. The others are asleep, and being asleep are merely animals walking on two legs —the \"unfeatheredbipeds\" of Diogenes.19. Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shall rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth isnot of us.A god living in a dog would be one who was prevented from fulfilling his function properly. The highest are thosewho have mastered and transcended accidental environment. They rejoice, because they do their Will; and if anyman sorrow, it is clear evidence of something wrong with him. When machinery creaks and growls, the engineerknows that it is not fulfilling its function, doing its Will, with ease and joy.Its Will, in this case, being a Bud- Will of the engineer — we hope. Readers will note that \"God\" and \"dog\" are thesame value by the Qabalah, but the letters are inverted in order. In either case, the value is either 77—if we treat the0 as an Ayin —or 13, if we treat the 0 as a Vau. 77 is the Goat, the Devil; 13 is the Atu Death, in which the centralfigure once again is Saturn, the Great One of the Night of Time. This is the \"God No\" —the God who can live in adog. Again, there is an identification between the Qabalistic values of No and ON, for which see Liber XV andothers. \"No\" can, of course, be written NV, 56, Nuit; but is also 50+70=120, the mystical age of the Adept Minor.The Adept Minor has crossed that Veil on one side of which is written \"No separate existence'; and on the other, \"Noexistence\".There is, of course, one God who lives in a dog —the God Anubis, who guides the soul in the Underworld. This is ahint for members of a certain Grade. It must also be remarked that \"the Dog\" was one of the names ascribed to the\"Devil\" in the Middle Ages.The verse has, therefore, several subtle technical meanings which will depend for usefulness on the Grade of thereader—which, by the way, is the case with any verse of Liber AL. The general meaning, however, is that ascribedby A. C., with the added value that \"dog\" is \"God\" inverted. Men and women called \"dogs\" are, therefore, peoplewho are functioning with their polarity inverted —who are functioning as animals, rather than as \"lords of theearth\". This, by the way, is the case with any person who worships a \"God\" outside himself or herself, instead ofperceiving God (any God!) within. And the key is to reverse the formula. Instead of \"loving\" or \"fearing\" your\"God'; BE your \"God\"! He, she, or it is nothing but a projection of your own consciousness, anyway. \"There is noGod where I am.\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Certain rather amusing little obsessions through which Aspirants may pass had better be mentioned. First, is theidea that Liber AL recommends that all dogs be killed. Second, the idea that all dogs conceal a \"spy\" —from whichyou gravitate naturally to the previous conclusion. Third, the idea that dogs should be \"despised\" or \"mistreated\" ortreated as human beings. (Or rather, better than you would treat a human being, as some dog lovers do!) Theyshould be treated like dogs, that is, like any other animals — with respect. (By respect\" is not meant that the Chinesemust stop eating chow!)One of the more amusing obsessions in this connection is that concerning Sirius —the \"Dog Star\". Certain\"initiates\" who fear 666 and Liber AL whisper to their \"disciples\" that \"the site of the Rosy Cross Brotherhood is inSirius.\" Meaning, of course, themselves. Poor Sirius!...Any person who has not achieved consciousness of his or her own Godhead tends to mistreat animals. Either is toocruel towards them, or too kind. A member of a certain American family who achieved great political notoriety wasactually known, during the last World War (World War II, for the benefit of future readers), to demand that his dogbe given a seat in the last plane to leave an island in the Pacific. The dog weighed as much as a wounded G.I., but aG.I. remained behind so the gentleman's dog could return to the bosom of the gentleman's family. The gentlemanhad already been elected to public office, and was elected again. It can never be too often repeated that any peoplealways have the government they deserve.In connection with this and other verses of this Chapter. serious students should consult LXV, i, 21; ii, 3; iii, 3 7-39;iv, 60; v, 5; and VII, iv, 8; vi, 5-6.20. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.As soon as one realizes one's self as Hadit, one obtains all His qualities. It is all a question of doing one's Will. Aflaming harlot, with red cap and sparkling eyes, her foot on the neck of a dead king, is just as much a star as herpredecessor, simpering in his arms. (Needless to say, in either case, he was not much of a king. I would like to haveseen a woman trying either maneuver with Crowley, for one! More on kings later.) But one must be a flamingharlot— one must let oneself go, whether one's star be twin with that of Shelley, or of Blake, or of Titian, or ofBeethoven. Beauty and strength come from doing one's Will; you have only to look at any one who is doing it torecognize the glory of it.There is also, of course, a technical meaning. Beauty is Tiphereth, Strength is Jesod, Leaping Laughter is Hod,Delicious Languor is Netzach, Force is XI, Fire is XVL The \"highest\" must have conquered the Lower Triad, and bewell (if you will pardon the pun) on their way to conquer Geburah and Gedulah. This organization is necessarybefore you can know and do your True Will with even some degree of efficiency. For although Gimel brings you theInfluence of Kether, the disorder of the Mind and the grossness of the Emotions hinder your attempts to interpretand reflect it. That is why most of your fellowmen are little better than wild animals —are domestic animals — dogs.21. We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in their misery. For they feel not. Compassionis the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and thejoy of the world. Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verily thou shalt not die, but live. Nowlet it be understood: If the body of the King dissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The Sun, Strength & Sight, Light; these are for the servants of the Star & the Snake.Crowley was upset by this verse of the Second Chapter all his life, and some of his more egregious blunders wereattempts to punish himself for having written it down. It must be understood, for it strikes at the root of slave-morals.\"We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit.\" Nothing—Nuit. Outcast —Initiates who have been expelled forwrong-doing, that is, 'Black Brethren'. Unfit — those as yet incapable of being initiated, that is, the great majority ofmankind. We have Nuit in common with them. To the 'Black Brethren' She manifests Herself as 333 — that Influencethat will eventually destroy them, that is, force them to cross the Abyss whether they \"will\" or no. To commonmankind She is manifested in all Nature, but particularly so in women everywhere. There is, of course, a furthermeaning, having to do with the Communion of the Saints of which we have already spoken.\"For they feel not.\" Upon dying — whether physical or initiatic death —they become conscious of their starry"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"nature —Had it. The Will-to-Die has to be treated with the same respect as the Will-to-Live. Who are you to traceanother star's course?\"Compassion is the vice of kings.\" This is not to be interpreted as meaning that kings should have no compassion. Itis a straight assertion of fact: only kings have compassion! Petty souls delight in the sufferings of others. The mobshouts with glee at the sight of blood. Nor is compassion to be confused with pity. Pity is of the Ego, and involves acomparison between yourself and the object of pity —which is duality. Compassion, as the etymology indicates,involves a 'sharing with'. The equivalent Greek word is empathy. Compassion is never maudlin. On the contrary,those who experience it often feel furious with others who only show \"pity\".\"Stamp down the wretched & the weak\" By all means; but who are the wretched & the weak? This writer remembersturning a street corner and seeing a man in the throes of an epileptic attack. A crowd of passersby had congregatedaround the man and watched his antics with prim and solemn faces. The writer felt a strong wish to obliterate themfrom the face of the earth. He did what he could to ease the epileptic's situation, and as soon as the star startedrecovering control of its vehicles he went away, knowing that the star would feel embarrassed. The crowd remainedbehind to watch.We must seek a clear definition of our values. Who is strong? The man who delights in the suffering of otherhumans, or who needlessly hurts an animal? Or, on the other hand, the man who condemns scientists whoexperiment on animals to learn how to cure diseases, and is always eager to intervene between his neighbor and hisprivate grief?Who is strong? The man who allows the existence and prosperity of others who think differently from him, whorefuse to serve him or his ideals, or the man who interprets every demonstration of autonomy as an affront of hisego?Who is weaker? The Nazi who burned a dead Jew in an oven, or any man who worships a God that he considerswilling to let a living soul burn in hell forever?Who is stronger? The man who daily scatters fish among the hungry, or the man who teaches the hungry how to fishfor themselves?Who is a king? The man who says \"I am the light of the world; come unto me, ye who suffer, and be consoled,\" orthe man who says \"Every man and every woman is a star; 'Come unto me 'is a foolish word; for it is I that go.\"?Reader, the choice is yours; the kings of the earth shall be Kings for ever; the slaves shall serve. There is no lawbeyond Do what thou wilt.While we are on the subject of kings, we must touch upon that lie: \"That Thou Must Die.\" Verse 49 of Chapter Oneshould be consulted in connection with this; also the Golden Bough, the New Testament of the Bible, and theMystery of Osiris in any good textbook of Egyptology. For ten thousand years tribes all over the world sacrificedtheir kings. Compassion being the vice of kings, the kings were, quite often, willing to be sacrificed. This was amagickal operation to buy energy for the people, but it was based on a wrong interpretation of the Bloody Sacrifice,for which see Book Four, Part Three.The result of these ten thousand years of killing the goose that lay the golden eggs — if Alchemists will pardon theatrocious pun — is that Aspirants may become obsessed by the idea that they must die for the benefit of the \"lowerbrethren\"; or \"mankind\"; or what not. They are enthusiastically encouraged in this illusion by the 'Black Brethren';who are only too eager to get rid of Aspirants. The 'savior complex'; as Wilhelm Stekel called it, is extremelyinsidious because it is connected with Spiritual Pride. Actually, it is an insult to your fellowmen. Every man andevery woman is a star. No soul needs to be saved by you —or could be saved by you, if you tried. The story of \"JesusChrist\"; as interpreted in the Nicean Creed, is a blasphemy.Serious students should consult Liber OZ and A. C. 's translation of the Tao Teh King; also Liber VII, vi, 22-25, 40-41, and vii, 36-39; and the following chapters of Liber Aleph: 30-35, 39,64,66,67-77,99,104, 105, 113, 116-118,147, 148, 192-194."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"There follows the Commentary to this verse by A.C.There is a good deal of the Nietzschean standpoint in this verse. It is the evolutionary and natural view. Of what useis it to perpetuate the misery of Tuberculosis, and such diseases, as we now do? Nature's way is to weed out theweak. (Weak either in physical or intellectual strength. Darwin never spoke of survival of brute strength; he spoke ofsurvival of the fittest. If brute strength were the aim of the Law of Evolution, dinosaurs would rule the earth, andman, physically the weakest of the great mammals, would be extinct.) This is the most merciful way, too. At presentall the strong are being damaged, and their progress hindered by the dead weight of the weak limbs and the missinglimbs, the diseased limbs and the atrophied limbs. The Christians to the Lions! (Lions is in capitals.)Our humanitarianism, which is the syphilis of the mind, acts on the basis of the lie that the King must die. The Kingis beyond death; it is merely a pool where he dips for refreshment. (Crowley was too modest to understand thatthough all men are stars, not all men are kings, and not all kings are Kings.) We must therefore go back to Spartanideas of education; (With a generous sprinkling of Athenian, perhaps; but to go forward to Thelemic ideas ofeducation is infinitely better. See Liber Aleph, 30-49.) and the worst enemies of humanity are those who wish, underthe pretext of compassion, to continue its ills through the generations. The Christians to the Lions! (Again Lions is incapitals.)Let weak and wry productions go back into the melting-pot, as is done with flawed steel castings. Death will purge,reincarnation make whole, these errors and abortions. (The reader may here object that he does not believe inreincarnation; but whether he does or not, this does not change the validity of the Law of Evolution. It is immaterialwhether a man's soul is immortal; it is material that he have good health and a good brain.) Nature herself may betrusted to do this, if only we will leave her alone. But what of those who, physically fitted to live, are tainted withrottenness of soul, cancerous with the sin-complex? For the third time I answer: The Christians to the Lions! (Yes,but who decides whose soul is rotten? People have said that Crowley's soul is rotting in hell for years. Thisreasoning is entirely fallacious, much below his usual standard. He is merely trying to defend a verse that heabhors. Now, as he changes the subject, his manner improves. He never understood the meaning of this verse at all.)Hadit calls himself the Star (Not in the least; servants of the Star & the Snake are the Adepts, serving Babalon andthe Beast. One does not serve Had it; \"for it is I that go.\"), the Star being the Unit of the Macrocosm; and the Snake,the Snake being the symbol of Going or Love, and the Chariot of Life. He is Harpocrates, the Dwarf-Soul, theSpermatozoon of all Life, as one may phrase it. The Sun, etc., are the external manifestations or Vestures of thisSoul, as a Man is the Garment of an actual Spermatozoon, the Tree sprung of that Seed, with power to multiply andto perpetuate that particular Nature, though without necessary consciousness of what is happening.In a deeper sense, the word 'Death' is meaningless apart from the presentation of the Universe as conditioned by'Time'. But what is the meaning of Time?There is great confusion of thought in the use of the word 'eternal' and the phrase 'for ever'. People who want 'eternalhappiness' mean by that a cycle of varying events all effective in stimulating pleasant sensations; i.e., they want timeto continue exactly as it does with themselves released from the contingencies of accidents such as poverty, sicknessand death. An eternal state is however a possible experience, if one interprets the term sensibly. One can kindle\"flamman aeternae caritatis\", for instance; one can experience a love which is in truth eternal. Such love must haveno relation with phenomena whose condition is time. Similarly, one's 'immortal soul' is a different kind of thingaltogether from one's mortal vesture. This Soul is a particular Star, with its own peculiar qualities, of course; butthese qualities are all 'eternal', and part of the nature of the Soul. This Soul being a monistic consciousness, it isunable to appreciate itself and its qualities, as explained in a previous entry; so it realizes itself by the device ofduality, with the limitations of time, space and causality. The 'Happiness' of Wedded Love or eating Marrons Glacesis a concrete external non-eternal expression of the corresponding abstract internal eternal idea, just as any triangle isone partial and imperfect picture of the idea of a triangle. (It does not matter whether we consider 'Triangle' as anunreal thing invented for the convenience of including all actual triangles, or vice-versa. Once the idea Triangle hasarisen, actual triangles are related to it as above stated.)One does not want even a comparatively brief extension of these 'actual' states; Wedded Love, though licensed for alife-time, is usually intolerable after a month; and Marrons Glaces pall after the first five or six kilogrammes havebeen consumed. But the 'Happiness', eternal and formless, is not less enjoyable because these forms of it cease to"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"give pleasure. What happens is that the Idea ceases to find its image in those particular images; it begins to notice thelimitations which are not itself and indeed deny itself, as soon as its original joy in its success at having becomeconscious of itself wears off. It becomes aware of the external imperfection of Marrons Glaces; they no longerrepresent its infinitely varied nature. It therefore rejects them, and creates a new form of itself, such as Night-gownswith pale yellow ribbons or Amber Cigarettes.In the same way a poet or painter, wishing to express Beauty, is impelled to choose a particular form; with luck, thisis at first able to recompense in him what he feels; but sooner or later he finds that he has failed to include certainelements of himself, and he must needs embody these in a new poem or picture. He may know that he can never domore than present a part of the possible perfection, and that in imperfect imagery; but at least he may utter his utmostwithin the limits of the mental and sensory instruments of his similarly inadequate symbol of the Absolute, hisvehicle of human incarnation.These suffer from the same defects as the other forms: ultimately, 'Happiness' wearies itself in the effort to inventfresh images, and becomes disheartened and doubtful of itself. Only a few people have wit enough to proceed togeneralization from the failure of a few familiar figures of itself, and recognize that all 'actual' forms are imperfect;but such people are apt to turn with disgust from the whole procedure, and to long for the 'eternal' state. This state ishowever incapable of realization, as we know; and the Soul, understanding this, can find no good but in \"Cessation\"of all things, its creations no more than its own tendencies to create. It therefore sighs for Nibbana.But there is one other solution, as I have endeavoured to show. We may accept (what after all it is absurd to accuseand oppose) the essential character of existence. We cannot extirpate or even alter in the minutest degree either thematter or manner of any element of the Universe, here each item is equally inherent and important, each co-substantial and coherent, each aequipollent, independent, and interdependent.We may thus acquiesce in the fact that it is apodeitically implicit in the Absolute to apprehend itself by self-expression as Positive and Negative in the first place, and to combine these primary opposites in an infinite varietyof finite forms.We may thus cease either (1) to seek the Absolute in any of its images, knowing that we must abstract every one oftheir qualities from every one of these equally if we would unveil it; or (2) to reject all images of the Absolute,knowing that attainment thereof would be the signal for the manifestation of that part of its nature which necessarilyformulates itself in a new universe of images.Realizing that these two courses (the materialist's and the mystic's) are equally fatuous, we may engage in either orboth of two other plans of action, based on assent to actuality.We may (1) ascertain our own particular properties as partial projections of the Absolute; we may allow every imagepresented to us to be of equally intrinsic and essential entity with ourselves, and its presentation to us a phenomenonnecessary in Nature; and we may adjust our apprehension to the actuality that every event is an item in the accountwhich we render to ourselves of our own estate. We dare not desire to omit any single entry, lest the balance beupset. We may react with elasticity and indifference to each occurrence, intent only on the idea that the total,intelligently appreciated, constitutes a perfect knowledge not indeed of the Absolute, but of that part thereof which isourselves. We thus adjust one imperfection accurately to another, and remain contented in the appreciation of therighteousness of the relation.This path, the \"Way of the Tao\", is perfectly proper to all men. It does not attempt either to transcend or to tamperwith Truth; it is loyal to its own laws, and therefore no less perfect than any other Truth. The Equation Five plus Sixis Eleven is of the same order of perfection as Ten Million times Ten Thousand Million is One Billion. In theUniverse formulated by the Absolute, every point is equally the Centre; every point is equally the focus of the forcesof the whole. (In any system of three points, any two may be considered solely with reference to the third, so thateven in a finite universe the sum of the properties of all points is the same, though no two properties maybe commonto any two points. Thus a circle, BCD, may be described by the revolution of a line AB in a plane about the point A;but also from the point C, or indeed any other point, by the application of the proper analysis and construction. Wecalculate the motion of the solar system in heliocentric terms for no reason but simplicity and convenience; we couldconvert our tables to a geocentric basis by mere mechanical manipulation without affecting their truth, which is onlythe truth of the relations between a number of bodies. All are alike in motion, but we have arbitrarily chosen to"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"consider one of them as stationary, so that we may more easily describe the movements of the others in regard to it,without complicating our calculations by introduction of the movements of the whole system as such. And for thispurpose the Sun is a more convenient standard than the Earth.)There is another Way that we may take, if we will; I say \"another\", though it seems perhaps to some no more than adevelopment of the other which happens to be proper to some people.Even in the first Way, it is of all things necessary to begin by exploring one's own Nature, so as to discover what itspeculiarities are; this is accomplished partly by introspection, but principally by Right Recollection of the wholephantasmagoria presented to it by experience; for since every event of life is a symbol of part of the structure of theSoul, the totality of experience must be the \"Name\" of the whole of that part of the Soul which has so far uttereditself. Now then, let us suppose that some Soul, having penetrated thus far, should discover in its \"Name\" that it is aSon truly Begotten by the Spirit of Being upon the Body of Form, and that it has power to understand itself and itsFather, with all that such heirship implies. Suppose further that it be come to puberty, will it not be impelled to assertitself as its Father's son? Will it not shake itself free from the Form that bore and nourished and trained it, and turnfrom its brothers and sisters and playmates? Will it not glow and ache with the impulse to be utterly itself, and find aForm fit to impress with its image, even as did its Father aforetime?If such a Soul be indeed its Father's son, he will not fear to show lack of filial reverence, or presumption, if he forgethis family in the fervour of founding one of his own, of begetting boys not better or braver indeed than his brothers,girls not softer or sweeter indeed than his sisters, but wholly his own, with his own defects and desires evoked byenchantment of ecstasy when he dies to himself in the womb of the witch who lusts for his life, and buys it with theCoin that bears his Image and Superscription.Such is the secret of the Soul of the Artist. He knows that he is a God, of the Sons of God; he has no fear or shame inshowing himself of the seed of his Father. He is proud of that Father's most precious privilege, and he honours himno less than himself by using it. He accepts his family as of his own royal stock; every one is as princely as he ishimself. But he were not his Father's son unless he found for himself a Form fit to express himself in manycostumes, each emphatic of some elected elegance or excellence in himself which would otherwise elude his homageby being hidden and hushed in the harmony of his heart. This Form which shall serve him must be softness's self tohis impress, with exact elasticity adapting itself to the strongest and subtlest salients, yet like steel to resist all otherstress than his own and to retain and reproduce surely and sharply the image that his acid bites into its surface. Theremust be no flaw, no irregularity, no granulation, no warp in its substance; it must be smooth and shining, pure metalof true temper.And he must love this chosen Form, love it with fearful fervour; it is the face of his Fate that craves his kiss, and inher eyes Enigma blazes and smoulders; she is his death, her body his coffin where he may rot and stink, or writhe indamned dreams, self-slain, or rise in incorruption self-renewed, immortal and identical, fulfilling himself wholly inand by her, splashing all space with sparkling stars his sons and daughters, each star an image of his won infinitymade manifest, mood after mood, by her magick to mould him when his passion makes molten her metal.Thus then must every Artist work. First, he must find himself. Next, he must find the form that is fitten to expresshimself Next, he must love that form, as a form, adoring it, understanding it, and mastering it, with most minuteattention, until it (as it seems) adapts itself to him with eager elasticity, and answers accurately and aptly, with theunconscious automatism of an organ perfected by evolution, to his most subtlest suggestion, to his most giantgesture.Next, he must give himself utterly up to that Form; he must annihilate himself absolutely in every act of love,labouring day and night to lose himself in lust for it,so that he leave no atom unconsumed in the furnace of theirfrenzy as did of old his Father that begat him. He must realize himself wholly in the integration of the infinitePantheon of images; for if he fail to formulate one facet of himself, by lack thereof will he know himself falsely.There is of course no ultimate difference between the Artist as here delineated and him who follows the \"Way of theTao,\" though the latter finds perfection in his existing relation with his environment, and the former creates a privateperfection of a peculiar and secondary character. We might call one the son, and the other the daughter, of theAbsolute."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"But the Artist, though his Work, the images of himself in the Form that he loves, is less perfect than the Work of hisFather, since he can but express one particular point of view and that by means of one type of technique, is not to bethought useless on that account, any more than an Atlas is useless because it presents by means of certain crudeconventions a fraction of the facts of geography.The Artist calls our attention away from Nature, whose immensity bewilders us so that she seems incoherent, andunintelligble, to his own interpretation of himself, and his relations with various phenomena of nature expressed in alanguage more or less common to us all.The smaller the Artist, the narrower his view, the more vulgar his vocabulary, the more familiar his figures, the morereadily is he recognized as a guide. To be accepted and admired, he must say what we all know, but have not toldeach other till it is tedious, and say it in simple and clear language, a little more emphatically and eloquently than wehave been accustomed to hear; and he must please and flatter us in the telling by soothing our fears and stimulatingour hopes and our self-esteem.When an Artist — whether in Astronomy, like Copernicus, Anthropology, like Ibsen, or Anatomy, like Darwin—selects a set of facts too large, too recondite, or too \"regrettable\" to receive instant assent from everybody; when hepresents conclusions which conflict with popular credence or prejudice; when he employs a language which is notgenerally intelligible to all; in such cases he must be content to appeal to the few. He must wait for the world toawake to the value of his work.The greater he is, the more individual and the less intelligible he will appear to be, although in reality he is moreuniversal and more simple than anybody. He must be indifferent to anything but his own integrity in the realizationand imagination of himself.Such was, and is, the case of the Artist Aleister Crowley.22. I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men withdrunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof!They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, oman! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.Drunkenness is a curse and a hindrance only to slaves. Shelley's couriers were 'drunk on the wind of their ownspeed'. Anyone who is doing his True Will is drunk with the delight of Life.Wine and strange drugs do not harm people who are doing their will; they only poison people who are cancerouswith Original Sin. Truth is so terrible to these detestable mockeries of humanity that the thought of self is arealization of hell. Therefore they fly to drink and drugs as to an anaesthetic in the surgical operation ofintrospection.The craving for these things is caused by the internal misery which their use reveals to the slave-souls. If you arereally free, you can take cocaine as simply as salt-water taffy. There is no better rough test of a soul than its attitudeto drugs. If a man is simple, fearless, eager, he is all right; he will not become a slave. If he is afraid, he is already aslave. Let the whole world take opium, hashish, and the rest; those who are liable to abuse them are better dead.For it is in the power of all so-called intoxicating drugs to reveal a man to himself. If this revelation declare a Star,then it shines brighter ever after. If it declare a Christian— a thing not man nor beast, but a muddle of mind — hecraves the drug, no more for its analytical but for its numbing effect.\"this folly against self\": altruism is a direct assertion of duality, which is division, restriction, sin, in its vilest form. Ilove my neighbour because love makes him part of me; not because hate divides him from me. Our Law is so simplethat it constantly approximates to truism.\"the exposure of innocence\": Exposure means 'putting out' as in a shop-window. The pretence of altruism and so-called virtue 'is a lie'; it is the hypocrisy of the Puritan, which is hideously corrupting both to the hypocrite and to hisvictim."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"To 'lust' is to grasp continually at fresh aspects of Nuit. It is the mistake of the vulgar to expect to find satisfaction inthe objects of sense. Disillusion is inevitable; when it comes, it leads only too often to an error which is in realitymore fatal than the former, the denial of 'materiality' and of 'animalism'. There is a correspondence between thesetwo attitudes and those of the 'once-born' and 'twice born' of William James (Varieties of Religious Experience).Thelemites are 'thrice-born'; we accept everything for what it is without lust of result, without insisting upon thingsconforming with a priori ideals, or regretting their failure to do so. We can therefore 'enjoy all things of sense andrapture' according to their true nature. For example, the average man dreads tuberculosis. The 'Christian Scientist'flees this fear by pretending that the disease is an illusion in 'mortal mind'. But the Thelemite accepts it for what it is,and finds interest in it for its own sake. For him it is a necessary part of the Universe; he makes 'no difference'between it and any other thing. The artist's position is analogous. Rubens, for instance, takes a gross pleasure infemale flesh, rendering it truthfully from lack of imagination and analysis. Idealist painters like Bougereau awake tothe divergence between Nature and their academic standards of Beauty, falsify the facts in order to deludethemselves. The greatest, like Rembrandt, paint a gallant, a hag, and a carcass with equal passion and rapture; theylove the truth as it is. They do not admit that anything can be ugly or evil; its existence justifies itself. This isbecause they know themselves to be part of an harmonious unity; to disdain any item of it would be to blaspheme thewhole. The Thelemite is able to revel in any experience soever; in each he recognizes the tokens of ultimate Truth. Itis surely obvious, even intellectually, that all phenomena are interdependent, and therefore involve each other.Suppose abc =d,a=d-b-c just as much as bd-c-a. It is senseless to pick out one equation as and another as 'nasty'.Personal predilections are evidence of imperfect vision (All this is philosophical, of course. Your imperfect vision,inpractice,justifies your personal predilections. Or, in other words, Do what thou wilt!). But it is even worse to denyreality to such facts as refuse to humour them. In the charter of spiritual sovereignty it is written that the charcoal-burner is no less a subject than the duke. The structure of the state includes all elements; it were stupid and suicidalto aim at homogeneity, or to assert it. Spiritual experience soon enables the aspirant to assimilate these ideas, and hecan enjoy life to the full, finding his True Self alike in the contemplation of every element of existence.Some technical aspects of the verse had better be touched upon. First, note that to worship Hadit one is to take 'wineand strange drugs', for which see Liber Aleph, Chapters 93-94. This is because you ARE Hadit; alcohol and suchdrugs temporarily release your inhibitions, your complexes and the brainwashing you have been subjected to sinceyour birth in a slave-culture, and let your True Self come to the surface of your consciousness. If the coming isviolent or 'anti-social', this is not caused by the drugs or the alcohol. They are not 'evil' or 'corrupting'. They merelyliberate. Remember the Djin in the fisherman's bottle of the Thousand and One Nights. During the first thousandyears of his imprisonment he vowed that he would make rich the man who freed him. In the second thousand yearsconfinement had made him so angry that he vowed he would kill that man. Violence and 'anti-social' behavior mayappear when alcohol or drugs are used. Such symptoms simply mean that your True Self has been violentlyrepressed for too long. They do not mean that your True Self is 'evil'. They indicate a need for a complete change ofenvironment and moral code, a search for circumstances that will make easier your self-expression. You must heedcarefully the warning and, if you are not a fool, you will bless the drugs that afforded you such an insight into yourstate of spiritual servitude to false (false to you!) idols and ideals. See Liber Aleph, 3, 30-35, 1 04-105, 118. Also,Emerson's essay, \"Self Reliance\".The present laws against the use of drugs in all so-called 'civilized' countries were passed by people totally ignorantof the nature and effect of the drugs concerned, at the instigation of people who were only too aware of theliberating power of such drugs. For the same reason do these people disapprove of free sexual intercourse—theyknow that the catharsis of orgasm also liberates, even if for one moment, the True Self within. Remember, all ye, thatno true God will ever condemn any act of self expression, even when exaggerated by past repression. Rememberalso that all false gods will.The propaganda against drugs is fostered by 'Black Brethren' and done by religious organizations, by opportunisticpoliticians, and by (surprising as it may seem) the trafficants themselves. The Mafia and other outfits are certainlynot interested in relaxation of anti-drug legislation. All crime syndicates would vanish within ten years if morphine,heroin, cocaine could be freely bought by any adult citizen from any licensed physician.On the subject of drug-traffic and drug-addiction, readers are advised to consult the pertinent section in Mr. ErleStanley Gardener's very interesting The Court of Last Resort, where some hard facts are courageously anduncompromisingly exposed."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"\"They shall not harm ye at all.\" Your True Self is not \"evil\". Of course, it is not \"good\", either! It merely is. Yourconscious will never be harmed by intimacy with it; on the contrary. It is said that Aleister Crowley died of drug-addiction. He died in 1947, seventy-two years old, in complete possession of his not inconsiderable mental powers.He had been taking heroin since his teens, and experimented with practically all known drugs. He was the first manto postulate their psychoanalytic powers.\"The exposure of innocence is a lie.\" One of the main symptoms of infection by a diseased magical current isconfusion in the vehicles. Sentimentality is thought tinged by emotion, and in such cases the thought is biased andthe emotion misleading. People speak a lot about the innocence of children. Children are not innocent. They aremerely ignorant. Ignorance is not innocence. Innocence consists in being true to oneself, in doing one's True Will.The ignorant cannot do this. Purity consists in keeping everything in its place, and you cannot do this if you don'tknow things and if you don't know their places. The place of a rigid penis is inside a lubricating vulva, and this,also, is purity. lam speaking, of course, as a heterosexual. If you prefer back sides, I will not deny you for it—provided you don't try to force your attentions on those of a different preference. And even if you try, I will berelatively lenient with you, for, as Blake said, you'll never know what is enough unless you know what is too much,and the way to Knowledge is the Way of Hard Knocks on a Thick Skull. Everybody is entitled to one mistake. To erris human. But to persevere in error is theological.23. I am alone: there is no God where I am.This refers to the spiritual experience of Identity. To admit God is to look up to God, and so not to be God. The curseof duality.We refer the reader to the following verses in Chapter One, and the Commentaries thereon: 11, 21, 31, 45, 48. Also,to Chapter Three, verse 19.24. Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my Mends who be hermits. Now think not to findthem in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women withlarge limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them.Ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a million timesgreater than this. Beware lest any force another, King against King! Love one another with burning hearts;on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath.A hermit is one who dwells isolated in the desert, exactly as a soul, a star (Not all stars, however; see Liber Aleph,144) or an electron in the wilderness of space-time. The doctrine here put forth is that the initiate cannot be pollutedby any particular environment. He accepts and enjoys everything that is proper to his nature. Thus, a man's sexualcharacter is one form of his self-expression; he unites Hadit with Nuit sacramentally when he satisfies his instinct ofphysical love. Of course, this is only one partial projection; to govern, to fight, and so on, must fulfill other needs.We must not imagine that any form of activity is ipso facto incapable of supplying the elements of an Eucharist:suum cuique. Observe, however, the constant factor in this enumeration of the practices proper to 'hermits': it isecstatic delight. Let us borrow an analogy from Chemistry. Oxygen has two hands (so to speak) to offer to otherelements. But contrast the cordial clasp of hydrogen or phosphorus with the weak reluctant greeting of chlorine! Yet,hydrogen and chlorine rush passionately to embrace each other in monogamic madness! There is no 'good' or 'bad' inthe matter; it is the enthusiastic energy of union, as betokened by the disengagement of heat, light, electricity, ormusic, and the stability of the resulting compound, that sanctifies the act. Note also that the utmost external joy inany phenomenon is surpassed a millionfold by the internal joy of the realization that self-fulfilment in the sensibleworld is but a symbol of the universal sublimity of the formula 'love under will'.The last two sentences demand careful attention. There is an apparent contradiction with verses 59, 60. We mustseek reconcilement in this way: Do not imagine that any King can die (v. 21) or be hurt (v.59): strife between Kingscan therefore be nothing more than a friendly trial of strength. We are all inevitably allies, even identical in ourvariety; to 'love one another with burning hearts' is one of our essential qualities.But who then are the 'low men', since 'Every man and every woman is a star'? The casus belli is this: there are peoplewho are veiled from themselves so deeply that they resent the bared faces of us others. We are fighting to free them,to make them masters like ourselves. Note verse 60, \"to hell with them\": that is, let us drive them to the 'hell' or"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"secret sanctuary within their consciousness. There dwells \"the worm that dieth not and the fire that is not quenched\";that is, 'the secret serpent coiled about to spring' and 'the flame that burns in every heart of man'—Hadit. In otherwords, we take up arms against falsehood; we cannot help it if that falsehood forces the King it has imprisoned toassent to its edicts, even to believe that his interests are those of his oppressor, and to fear Truth as once Jehovah didthe Serpent.The above is very romantic, of course; Kings are not 'fighting to make them masters like ourselves'; theyfight—when they fight at all —to avoid interference with their kingdoms. Low men, not being aware of their TrueWills, tend to invade the prerogatives of others with tiresome frequency. From fighting to make them masters like us'to 'fighting to save them from themselves' to 'dying for their sins' the distance is minimal.You cannot 'make' a King — note the word in capitals. A King makes himself A King is a man who 'wears thecrown; and the crown has, of course, always been the symbol of an activated Sahashara. Unless the symbol standsfor reality, the man is a 'king' but in name. No church can make a King, no parliament can make a King. The Kingis, first of all, King of his own soul. Next he may —or may not — be ruler over other men.The entire concept of kingship has been vitiated by two thousand years of dogma. It makes even archaeologistscommit egregious mistakes. For instance, it is now known that the Pyramids of Egypt were not built by \"hundreds ofthousands of slaves under the cruel lash of the overseer'; as the sadomasochism characteristic of the slave spiritwould have us believe: they were built by select crews of workers who elected their own foremen and cheerfullycompeted with each other to see which crew would work faster. They were paid from the royal treasure and fed fromthe royal granaries. They recorded their own jokes or incidents of the working day in stone. One such inscriptionhas been translated by scholars as meaning that \"some gangs were so pleased to work for the King that, as a laterforeman said, they toiled 'without a single man getting exhausted, without a man thirsting; and at last 'came home ingood spirits, sated with bread, drunk with beer, as if it were the beautiful festival of a god' \". All this, of course, fromtheir happiness in working for the King.This is absolute bullshit. What the foreman actually wrote was a record of their working conditions. \"Without asingle man getting exhausted\" means, evidently, that their working hours were short, perhaps five or six, withfrequent rest periods. \"Without a single man thirsting\" means, evidently, that plenty of drinking water was madeavailable to them during their working hours. And that at last they went home in good spirits, \"sated with bread anddrunk with beer, as if it were the beautiful festival of a god,\" means, evidently, that the King saw to it that they hadplenty of food and drink for lunch or midafternoon meal before they went back to their homes at night. They werehappy to work for the King not because the King was King, but because the King treated them as a decent andgenerous man should treat those who work for him. Their working hours were shorter, and the treatment theyreceived better, than is common in many so-called civilized communities today. They liked their King, and inscribeddisrespectful jokes about him, such as \"The King is royally drunk today.\" Undoubtedly, they were a bit tipsythemselves.Whenever the word King is used, there arises in the imagination of a 'low man' an image of arrogant and ruthlesspower. He envisions a Juggernaut ready to step all over him. This is what he wants, and this is what he usually gets,but not from a King — he gets it from a wretch like himself, and were he to wear a crown he would be a sadistictyrant, just as now he is a masochistic slave. There follow a few technical interpretations of this verse.\"Hermits\": This refers, of course, to the Third Grade of Thelemites, for which see Chapter One, vv. 40-4 1. \"Nowthink not to find them,\" etc., means that now, that is, in this Aeon, a Hermit is not to live in seclusion. The Hermits ofThelema must live in the world without being of the world. This, by the way, is in harmony with the ancient rule ofthe so-called \"Rosicrucians\".It should be axiomatic that the men most fit to govern ought to be those most hesitant to do so. A king's crown is acrown of thorns —if he is a good man and an honest king. The Tao Teh King — that Handbook of SensibleGovernment — is at pains to make this clear.One of the sheerest wastes of the past Aeon was that those men most fit to occupy responsible positions were sodisgusted by the animalism and stupidity of their fellowmen that they withdrew into desert regions and spent theirlives in silent meditation. Thus their civilizing influence was lost to the world. At the same time, they failed toadvance much in the kingdom of the spirit, having made things too easy for themselves. The spiritual musculature,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"like the physical, can be developed beyond any static condition only by being pitted against increased opposition.You must exercise your faculties, and you will be wise to find ever tougher problems to solve. Thus, in this Aeon, thePath of the Hermit goes into the world, and not out of it.Readers must not confuse hermits with monks, by the way. Monasteries, like nunneries, are social communities.Hermits go solitary; monks hunt in packs.\"Beasts of women\": this curious expression must not be interpreted as derogatory to womanhood. Every woman is astar. \"Beasts of women\" does not mean \"bestial women\" — see verse 70. There is a technical meaning, and it mustbe left to the \"Right Ingenium\" of the advanced Philosophus.\"Beware lest any force another\" — beware of interfering with each other's True Will.\"The day of your wrath\": See Liber VII, vii, vv. 29-39.25. Ye are against the people, 0 my chosen!By \"the people\" is meant that canting, whining, servile breed of whipped dogs which refuses to admit its deity. Themob is always afraid for its bread and butter when its tyrants let it have any butter -- and now and then the bread has60% substitutes of cattle- fodder. So, being afraid, it dare not strike. And when the trouble begins, we aristocrats ofFreedom, from the castle or the cottage, the tower or the tenement, shall have the slave mob against us.Still deeper, there is a meaning in this verse applicable to the process of personal initiation. By \"the people\" we mayunderstand the many-headed and mutable mob which swarms in the slums of our own minds. Most men are almostentirely at the mercy of a mass of loud and violent emotions, without discipline or even organization. They swaywith the mood of the moment. They lack purpose, foresight and intelligence. They are moved by ignorant andirrational instincts, many of which affront the law of self-preservation itself with suicidal stupidity. (This is theproduct of atavism, those instincts having been perfectly good at another time and in another environment. But torefuse to adapt oneself to new conditions is to go the way of the dinosaur. See Liber Aleph, 124-132.) The moral ideawhich we call 'the people' is the natural enemy of good government. He who is 'chosen' by Hadit to Kingship mustconsequently be 'against the people' if he is to pursue any consistent policy. The massed maggots of 'love' devouredMark Anthony as they did Abelard. For this reason the first task of the Aspirant is to disarm all his thoughts, to makehimself impregnably above the influence of any one of them; this he may accomplish by the methods given in LiberAleph, Liber Jugorum, Thien Tao, and elsewhere. Secondly, he must impose absolute silence upon them, as may bedone by the 'Yoga' practices taught in Book 4 Part I, in Liber XVI, etc. He is then ready to analyse them, to organizethem, to drill them, and so to take advantage of the properties peculiar to each one by employing its energies in theservices of his imperial purpose.A man's kingdom may be as small as a family and children, or as a hock-shop; it may be as great as an industrialcorporation, or an entire nation. It matters not to the mechanics of the art of self government, which is the first stepto government of others (which must—if you are a true king—always be relative to your particular positions asspiritual stars in the spiritual space of the Body of Nuit). See A. C. 's edition of the Tao Teh King.The idea of \"People'; however, by globing all individuals, no matter how diverse of nature or activity or interests, inone statistical monster with no head, is deadly misleading to freedom. You miss the tree for the forest, and you arethe tree. It matters not one jot what others think or do; \"every number is infinite\". Your single individual opinion ona plate of the balance weighs as much as the opinions of all other stars gathered on the other, for your orbit is \"atrest'; that is, its aim is Infinity, as is theirs, which means that your orbit is a function, or resultant, of all theirs. It isthis that makes it unique, therefore as important as all theirs. The \"people\", therefore, if rightly understood, cannever be more important than you. The plates weigh the same, for the Universe is balanced — is \"at rest\" Of course,you are the resultant\" of the people, from the point -of view of the \"people\". (But there is no \"point -of view of thepeople'; just the points-of view of all other stars, globally considered merely for convenience of thought.) But in thevery same sense, the \"people\" is a resultant of you. And this perspective is sound and practical and actual, while theother is merely a philosophical abstraction. Louis XIV's gardener had as much right as the king to say \"L'Etat, c'estmoi.\" That is, if he was as good as a gardener as the king was as a king. This explains the power of revolutions, asalso the universal belief in kings."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"26. I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy.

Observe that in the 'mystic' work, the union takes place spontaneously; in the other, venom is shot forth.This awakes the earth to rapture; not until then does union occur. For, in working on the planes of manifestation, theelements must be consecrated and made 'God' by virtue of a definite rite.27. There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shall make a great miss. He shallfall down into the pit called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.Intellectuals err terribly when they force proletarians to get 'education' in the sense of ability to read newspapers.Reason is rubbish; race-instinct is the true guide. Experience is the great Teacher; and each of us possesses millionsof years of experience, the very quintessence of it, stored automatically in our subconscious minds. The Intellectualsare worse than the bourgeoisie themselves; a la lanterne! Give us men!To understand is the attribute of the Master of the Temple, who has crossed the Abyss (or 'Pit') that divides the trueSelf from its conscious instrument. (See Liber 418, 'Aha!', and Book 4, Part III.) We must meditate the meaning ofthis attack upon the idea of 'Because'. The idea of 'Because' makes everything dependent on everything else, contraryto the conception of the Universe which this Book has formulated. It is true that the concatenation exists; but thechain does not fetter our limbs. The actions and reactions of illusion are only appearances; we are not affected. Noseries of images matters to the mirror. What then is the danger of making 'a great miss'? We are immune—that is thevery essence of the doctrine. But error exists in this sense, that we may imagine it; and when a lunatic believes thatMankind is conspiring to poison him, it is no consolation that others know his delusion for what it is. Thus, we must\"understand these runes\"; we must become aware of our True Selves; if we abdicate our authority as absoluteindividuals, we are liable to submit to Law, to feel ourselves the puppets of Determinism, and to suffer the agoniesof impotence which have afflicted the thinker, from Gautama to James Thompson.Now then, \"there is great danger in me\" — we have seen what it is; but why should it lie in Hadit? Because theprocess of self-analysis involves certain risks. The profane are protected against those subtle spiritual perils whichlie in ambush for the priest. A Bushman never has a nervous breakdown. (See Cap I, v.3 1.) When the Aspirant takeshis first Oath, the most trivial things turn into transcendental terrors, tortures and temptations. (Parts II and III ofBook 4 elaborate this thesis at length.) We are so caked with dirt that the germs of disease cannot reach us. If wedecide to wash, we must do it well; or we may have awakened some sleeping dogs, and set them on defencelessareas. Initiation stirs up the mud. It creates unstable equilibrium. It exposes our elements to unfamiliar conditions.The France of Louis XVI had to pass through the Terror before Napoleon could teach it to find itself. Similarly, anyerror in reaching the realization of Hadit may abandon the Aspirant to the ambitions of every frenzied faction of hischaracter, the masterless dogs of the Augean kennel of his mind.Some technical aspects of this verse had better be mentioned. First of all, HADIT equals 29 by the Qabalah, and sodoes BECAUSE. HADIT=5+1+4+10+9=29. BECAUSE = 2+5+3 +1 +6+7 +5 = 29.) \"Because\" means, therefore,a false sense of personal identity that may be taken for the true one, Hadit, by the unwary. Since the word 'Because'is evidently connected with the process of reasoning, we may equate it with the undisciplined Ruach, or Ego. In thissense pit' may not mean the Abyss, but a trap.It must be understood that Liber AL does not \"attack\" the proper use of the mental faculties. But it points out, veryemphatically, that intellection is, after all, but an instrument of the True Self The intellect-the Ego—is a goodservant, but a bad master. To put it in scientific language: intellection is but a faculty that our race has developed inthe process of adaptation to environment. It has made possible our empery over the entire animal, vegetable andmineral kingdoms for the time being and under present conditions. It is possible, however, to imagine a futurechange to conditions in which the intellect became a liability, rather than an asset. Some thinkers have alreadypointed out that we are progressing too fast in intellect and too slow emotionally. Our technology is that of the year"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"2000, but our morals date of 3000 to 4000 B.C. We are brought up by our parents to behave as if the socialconditions of the second half of the Twentieth Century were the same that led Moses to conceive the tribal codecalled the Ten Commandments. Unless we put the intellect in its proper perspective (the reasoning faculties, afterall, occupy only one fifth of the total capacity of our brains), and develop a moral code better adapted to our presentstage of evolution, we may end by atom- bombing each other to extinction. The purpose of Liber AL is precisely tointroduce a new, fully adapted, code of ethics. The Author estimates that the code he proposes will fulfil the needs ofhuman society for at least several centuries. (See AL III, 34) And the first step to acceptance and use of such a codeis to demote Reason from its false crown of king of the Self to its true function of instrument of the Libido. Freudanalysed the psyche correctly; but his emotional attachment to tabus (he was, after all, a Jew and a bourgeois) ledhim to the hopeless attempt of trying to saddle the lithe race-horse of the Contemporary Unconscious with the heavyaccoutrements of the seedy nag of Palestine.Reason is in capitals, which suggests a Qabalistic meaning. REASON =200+5+1+ 7+70+50=333, the number ofChoronzon, \"Dispersion\". (See Liber 418, the Tenth Aethyr.) \"Dogs of Reason\" are, therefore, the \"Black Brothers\".Why shall he perish with the \"Black Brothers\"? Because he will join their current. It manifests itself in the lowercakkrams, particularly those of the heart and the navel. The bodily Prana is deflected by it. Man's vital force shouldrise from the Muladhara Cakkram to the higher head centers, Visudhi, Ajna and Sahashara (See Liber V); instead, itdisperses itself in a reflex, confused, indirected activity of the intermediary centers. In the trained Initiate, the lowerCakkrams function entirely under the control of the head centers. Initiates are therefore frequently considered by\"mediums\" and \"clairvoyants\"to be \"cold'; or \"pitiless\", or without compassion\". Imperfect seers call the Initiate'saura \"black'; being unable to perceive the radiation of the higher centers (See AL I, 16-18, 21,27, 28,29, 60; II, 6,14,23, 50-53; III, 19-20, 22, 38,44-45,49, 74, 75.) The \"Black Brothers'; on the other hand seem to them to \"radiatesunlight\". The Prana in them never rises to the higher centers at all, and its rate of vibration is low enough to be\"seen of the unseeing\". The only radiation of their higher centers is the normal nerve circuitry of the body. TheCakkrams, if developed and functioning, are like electric transformers. They step up the vibratory rate of Prana. Thefaster they spin, the \"fainter\" and \"faerier\" becomes the Initiate's aura, until it becomes attuned to the Aura of theMilky Way -the \"Orgone light\" of Wilhelm Reich-the \"kisses of the stars\". Or, if you prefer, to the Body of Nuit,which of course is omnipresent. Any lower forms of energy exist in it.)If the Aspirant becomes attuned to \"Because'; he may mistake the \"Dog Syndrome\" of Cakkram malfunction for the\"God Syndrome\" of higher Cakkram awakening. He will identify himself with the Egoic Complex of the \"BlackBrethren\". \"Because\" is the reflex, on a much lower plane, of the Consciousness of Hadit. (Hadit is, of course,perceived only by the awakened Ajna. The Winged Globe of the Egyptians displays the \"two petals of the Lotus\" ofHindu symbolism.) Being a simulacrum, it is very dangerous. It includes all the egregora of \"God\" that have beenformed through the centuries. All \"Visions of God\" of all religions belong to \"Because\". (The lower Dhyanas are allbelow the Abyss. They are mental phenomena —their only connection with the Element of Spirit is the Kundalini thatenergizes them. And Kundalini should not be wasted in the mind. It should be sent straight up to the higher centers.\"There is no God where I am\". Unfortunately, in practice it is almost impossible to avoid the occurrence of Dhyana,since the Yogi is just beginning and is not familiar with the mechanics of the Sheaths of the Self. And the temptationto mistake Dhyana for Samadhi is deadly. Some wretches have spent the rest of their lives in the firm belief that they\"achieved\". To such people the \"Siddhi\" described by Patanjali seem the Crown of Perfection!)28. Now a curse upon Because and his kin!This is against those Intellectuals aforesaid. There are no 'standards of Right'. Ethics is balderdash. Each Star mustgo its own orbit. To hell with 'moral Principle'; there is no such thing; that is a herd-delusion, and makes men cattle.Such a doctrine does not make \"law and order\" and \"civilized behavior\" impossible; on the contrary, it is the firststep towards true civilization. It should be obvious that I have no right to impose, or even try to impose, my personalstandards on my neighbour. \"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\" Nor does my neighbour have the right to impose his onme. If he does not like my ways, he is free to seek associates of his own sympathies, and so am L Society, in short, isnot to be a community of slaves overseen by \"Black Brothers'; but a fluid, loose association of free men who act inconcert only where the selfish interests of each and every one of them counsels so. The selfishness of each one is theguarantee of the freedom of all. A business deal, to put it bluntly, has been mutually satisfactory and socially soundonly when each party goes away convinced that it \"did the other in\". When a leader tells his followers that it is timeto stop asking what their country (meaning him, of course!) can do for them, and start asking what they can do for"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"their country, it is time for the followers to elect a new leader. The country must always be a function of the citizens,not the citizens a function of the country!We may, moreover, consider 'Because' as involving the idea of causality, and therefore of duality. If cause and effectare really inseparable, as they must be by definition, it is mere clumsiness to regard them as separate; they are twoaspects of one single idea, conceived as consecutive for the sake of (apparent) convenience, or for the generalpurpose previously indicated of understanding and expressing ourselves in finite terms.Shallow indeed is the obvious objection to this passage, that the Book of the Law itself is full of phrases whichimply causality. Nobody denies that causality is a category of the mind, a form of condition of thought which, if notquite a theoretical necessity, is yet inevitable in practice. The very idea of any relation between two things appears ascausal. Even should we declare it to be casual, our minds would still insist that casuality itself was the effect of somecause. Our daily experience hammers home this conviction; and a man's mental excellence seems to be measurablealmost entirely in terms of the strength and depth of his appreciation thereof as the soul of the structure of theUniverse. It is the spine of Science which has vertebrated human Knowledge above the slimy mollusc whoseprinciple was Faith.We must not suppose for an instant that the Book of the Law is opposed to reason. On the contrary, its own claim toauthority rests upon reason, and nothing else. It disdains the arts of the orator. It makes reason the autocrat of themind. But that very fact emphasizes that the mind should attend to its own business. It should not transgress itslimits. It should be a perfect machine, an apparatus for representing the universe accurately and impartially to itsmaster. The Self, its Will, and its Apprehension, should be utterly beyond it. Its individual peculiarities are itsimperfections. If we identify ourselves with our thoughts or our bodily instincts, we are evidently pledged to partakeof their partiality. We make ourselves items of the interaction of our own illusions.In the following verses we shall find the practical application of this theorem.One technical aspect of this and the following verse should be mentioned. Aspirants must beware of personifying theidea of Because. For instance, the late Rudolf Steiner fabricated an \"Evil Being\" which he called \"Lucifer\" —thefalse Lucifer, since he correctly insisted that the Christ —666— is the true Lucifer. His description of the powersand influence of \"Lucifer\" is the description of the idea, or set of conditions, that Aiwass calls \"Because\". But Steinerfailed to realize that his idea of the \"Christ\" also fell into the category of Because! Steiner was a member of highgrade of the Order of Illuminates. But Thelemites are not Illuminates. The word \"Illuminate\" implies that you haveno inner light of your own, and this is the \"Dog-syndrome\" all over again. Every man and every woman is a star.The translation of the Latin title of Chapter 188 of Liber Aleph is \"On Different Works of the Illuminators\" —notIlluminates! You are referred once more to AL I 7-11, 49 and to AL II, 5-8, and the Commentaries thereon.29. May Because be accursed for ever!Distrust any explanation whatever. Disraeli said: Never ask any one to dinner who has to be explained. Allexplanations are intended to cover up lies, injustices, or shames. The Truth is radiantly simple.30. If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & does nought.There is no 'reason' why a Star should continue in its orbit. Let her rip! Every time the conscious acts, it interfereswith the Subconscious, which is Hadit. It is the voice of Man, and not of a God. Any man who 'listens to reason'ceases to be a revolutionary. The newspapers are Past Masters in the Lodge of Sophistry Number 333. They canalways prove to you that it is necessary, and patriotic, and all the rest of it, that you should suffer intolerable wrongs.The Qabalists represent the mind as a complex of six elements, whereas the Will is single, the direct expression as'The Word' of the Self. The mind must inform the Understanding, which then presents a simple idea to the Will. TheWill issues its orders accordingly, for unquestioning execution. If the Will should appeal to the mind, it must confuseitself with incomplete and uncoordinated ideas. The clamour of these cries crowns Anarchy, and action becomesimpossible.31. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"It is ridiculous to ask a dog why it barks. One must fulfil one's true Nature, one must do one's Will. To question thisis to destroy confidence, and so to create an inhibition. If a woman asks a man who wishes to kiss her why he wantsto do so, and he tries to explain, he becomes impotent. His proper course is to choke her into compliance, which iswhat she wants, anyhow.Power acts: the nature of the action depends on the information received by the Will; but once the decision is taken,reflection is out of place. Power should indeed be absolutely unconscious. Every athlete is aware that his skill,strength, and endurance depend on forbidding mind to meddle with muscle. Here is a simple experiment. Hold out aweight at arm's length. If you fix your attention firmly on other matters, you can support the strain many times longerthan if you allow yourself to think of what your body is doing.32. Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all their words are skew-wise.The \"factor infinite & unknown\" is the subconscious Will. 'On with the revel!' \"Their words\"—the plausible humbugof the newspapers and the churches. Forget it! Allons! Marchons!One can see how enthusiastic he was about the Socialist Movement The \"factor infinite & unknown\" is thesubconscious Will, in a sense; but in another sense, it is a factor in any equation in Nature. Modern Physics nolonger postulates absolute laws for phenomena; it enunciates its judgments under the form of high probabilities. Forinstance, there is a very high probability that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow. But there is no a priori denial ofthe possibility that it may rise in the west, except that in all recorded history it has never been known to do so. Thisargument is obviously not sufficient to overrule the possibility, and we must keep an open mind on the subject. If wedo, we will be prepared for the possibility of the sun rising in the west tomorrow, and will be quicker to adaptourselves to the phenomenon than many so-called scientists. Men whose minds are fixed have been known to goinsane when facts run contrary to their ideas.\"Their words\" —the technical meaning, of course, is the 'word' as a formula of power. The 'words' of the 'BlackBrothers' are always, of necessity, skew-wise. But now the words of past Magi are also so — see AL I, 49. They areto the Word of the Aeon of Horus as the Physics of Newton is to the Physics of Einstein. This is very importantbecause of the natural inertia of the mind. Until Thelemic momentum be firmly established in the life of an Aspirant,his mind will continuously tend to fall back into \"the pit called Because.\" He must live as if \"Might Be\" were \"Is';and persist in this apparently absurd course of conduct until the external world adapts itself to his Will. See LXV,Chapter Five, verses 52-56. The adaptation of the external world to the Will is inevitable if the Will be the True Will,because you are a Star in the Body of Nuit. Infinite Space is a function of you. You are Hadit, and Nuit is yourComplement. See AL II, verse 1. This is why \"Success is thy proof\" (Of course, the reverse idea is also true — youare a function of Infinite Space —See AL I, verse 1. But this merely means that the Third Kind of Magickal Link—see Book Four, Part III—is always present, and a form of the First Kind.)It has been explained at length in a previous note that 'reason is a lie' by nature. We may here add certainconfirmations suggested by the 'factor'. A and a (not-A) together make up the Universe. As a is evidently 'infiniteand unknown', its equal and opposite A must be no less. Again, from any proposition S is P, reason deduces 'S is notp'; thus the apparent finitude and knowability of S is deceptive, since it is in direct relation with p.No matter what n may be, n + ¥, the number of the inductive numbers, is unaltered by adding or subtracting it. Thereare just as many odd numbers as there are numbers altogether. Our knowledge is confined to statements of therelations between certain sets of our own sensory impressions: and we are convinced by our limitations that 'a factorinfinite and unknown' must be concealed within the sphere of which we see but one minute part of the surface. As toreason itself, what is more certain than that its laws are only the conscious expression of the limits imposed upon usby our animal nature, and that to attribute universal validity, or even significance, to them is a logical folly, theraving of our megalomania? Reason is no more than a set of rules developed by the race; it takes no account ofanything beyond sensory impressions and their reactions to various parts of our being. There is no possible escapefrom the vicious circle that we can register only the behaviour of our own instrument. We conclude, from the factthat it behaves at all, that there must be 'a factor infinite and unknown' at work upon it. This being the case, we maybe sure that our apparatus is inherently incapable of discovering the truth about anything, even in part.Modern science has at last grown out of the very-young-man cocksureness of the 19th century. It is now admitted"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"that axioms themselves depend on definitions, and that Intuitive Certainty is simply one trait of homo sapiens, likethe ears of the ass or the slime of the slug. That we reason as we do merely proves that we cannot reason otherwise.We cannot move the upper jaw; it does not follow that the idea of motion is ridiculous. The limitation hints ratherthat there may be an infinite variety of structures which the jaw cannot imagine. The metric system is not thenecessary mode of measurement. It is the mark of a mind untrained, to take its own processes as valid for all men,and its own judgments for absolute truth. Our two eyes see an object in two aspects, and present to ourconsciousness a third which agrees with neither, is indeed, strictly speaking, not sensible to sight, but to touch! Oursenses declare some things at rest and others in motion; our reason corrects the error, firstly by denying that anythingcan exist unless it is in motion, secondly by denying that absolute motion possesses any meaning at all.At the time when this Book was written, official Science angrily scouted the 'factor infinite and unknown', and clungwith pathetic faith to the idea that reason was the touchstone of truth. In a single sentence, Aiwaz anticipates thediscoveries by which the greatest minds now incarnate have made the last ten years memorable.33. Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!In my essays 'Truth' (in Konx Om Pax), 'The Soldier and the Hunchback', 'Eleusis', and others, I have offered adetailed demonstration of the self-contradictory nature of Reason. The crux of the whole proof may be summarizedby saying that any possible proposition must be equally true with its contradictory, as, if not, the universe would nolonger be in equilibrium. It is no objection that to accept this is to destroy conventional Logic, for that is exactlywhat it is intended to do. I may also mention briefly one line of analysis.I ask \"What is (e.g.) a tree?\" The dictionary defines this simple idea by means of many complex ideas; obviously onegets in deeper with every stroke one takes. The same applies to any 'Why' that may be posed. The one existingmystery disappears as a consequence of innumerable antecedents, each equally mysterious.To ask questions is thus evidently worse than a waste of time, so far as one is looking for an answer.There is also the point that any proposition S is P merely includes P in the connotation of 5, and is therefore notreally a statement of relation between two things, but an amendment of the definition of one of them. 'Some cats areblack' only means that our idea of a cat involves the liability to appear black, and that blackness is consistent withthose sets of impressions which we recognize as characteristic of cats. All ratiocination may be reduced to syllogisticform; hence, the sole effect of the process is to make each term more complex. Reason does not add to ourknowledge; a filing system does not increase one's correspondence directly, though by arranging it one gets a bettergrasp of one's business. Thus, coordination of our impressions should help us to control them; but to allow reason torule us is as abject as to expect the exactitude of our ledgers to enable us to dispense with initiative on the one handand actual transactions on the other.34. But ye, o my people, rise up & awake!We are not to calculate, to argue, to criticise; these things lead to division of will and to stagnation. They areshackles of our Going. They hamstring our Pegasus. We are to rise up — to Go — to Love— we are to be awake,alert — \"Joyous and eager, Our tresses adorning,0 let us beleaguer the City of Morning!\"The Secret of Magick is to 'enflame oneself in praying.' This is the ready test of a Star, that it whirls flaming throughthe sky. You cannot mistake it for an Old Maid objecting to Everything. This Universe is a wild revel of atoms, men,and stars, each one a Soul of Light and Mirth, horsed on Eternity.Observe that we must 'rise up' before we 'awake'. Aspiration to the Higher is a dream — a wish-fulfilment whichremains a phantasm to wheedle us away from seeking reality—unless we follow it up by Action. Only then do webecome fully aware of ourselves, and enter into right reaction with the world in which we live.35. Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy & beauty!A ritual is not a melancholy formality; it is a Sacrament, a Dance, a Commemoration of the Universe. The Universe"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"is endless rapture, wild and unconfined, a mad passion of speed. Astronomers tell us this of the Great Republic of theStars; physicists say the same of the Little Republic of Molecules. Shall not the Middle Republic of Men be like untothem? The polite ethicist demurs; his ideal is funereal solemnity. His horizon is bounded by death; and his spy-glassis smeared with the idea of sin. The New Aeon proclaims Man as Immortal God, eternally active to do His Will.All's Joy, all's Beauty; this Will we celebrate.In this verse we see how the awakening leads to ordered and purposeful action. Joy and Beauty are the evidence thatour functions are free and fit; when we take no pleasure, and find nothing to admire, in our work, we are doing itwrong.36. There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.Each element—fire, earth, air, water, and Spirit—possesses its own Nature, Will, and Magical Formula. Each onemay then have its appropriate ritual. Many such in crude form are described in The Golden Bough of Dr. J. G.Frazer, the Glory of Trinity!In particular the entry of the Sun into the cardinal signs of the elements at the Equinoxes and Solstices are suitablefor festivals.The difference between 'rituals' and 'feasts' is this: by the one a particular form of energy is generated, while there isa general discharge of one's superfluous force in the other. Yet, a feast implies periodical nourishment.37. A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride!There should be a special feast on the 12th day of August in every year, since it was the marriage of The Beastwhich made possible the revelation of the New Law. (This is not an Apology for Marriage. Hard cases make Bad Law.)38. A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.This is April 8th, 9th, and 10th, the feast beginning at High Noon.39. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet — secret,o Prophet!This particular feast is of a character suited only to initiates.40. A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.The Supreme Ritual is the Invocation of Horus, which brought about the Opening of the New Aeon. The date isMarch 20.The Equinox of the Gods is the term used to describe the Beginning of a New Aeon, or a New Magical Formula. Itshould be celebrated at every Equinox, in the manner known to Neophytes of the A:.A:..41. A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death!The feasts of fire and water indicate rejoicings to be made at the puberty of boys and girls respectively.The feast for life is at a birth; and the feast for death at a death. It is of the utmost importance to make funeralsmerry, so as to train people to take the proper view of death. The fear of death is one of the great weapons of tyrants,as well as their scourge; and it distorts our whole outlook upon the Universe.42. A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!To him who realizes Hadit this text needs little comment. It is wondrous, this joy of awakening every morning to thetruth of one's immortal energy and rapture. (See Liber HAD.)43.

But there is to be a particular Act of Worship of Our Lady, as"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ye well wot. (See Liber NV.)44. Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter.

(One of the great tragedies of modern lifeis the idea of \"retirement\". People stop working precisely at the age when they have gathered enough experience towork efficiently. The idea that work is an obligation and an effort is possible only in a slave society, where men andwomen work not at what they like, but at what they may. A person who is doing work harmonious with his or herTrue Will wants to work until he or she dies —because to work is fun. Hard fun, maybe —but great fun. Anoccasional rest is of course necessary; but if your work is congenial, you will soon find yourself missing it —andback to it you should go, whether you are twenty or eighty, whether to compose a symphony or wield a spade. It doesnot matter if you do it slower —your experience will make each move count, and even if it didn't, you are not a wardof society. On the contrary, society is a ward of you.) You are unconquerable, and of indefatigable energy. Greatmen find time for everything, shirk nothing, make reputations in half a dozen different lines, have twentysimultaneous love affairs, and live to a green old age. The milksops and valetudinarians never get anywhere; usuallythey die early; and even if they lived for ever, what the use?The body is itself a restriction as well as an instrument. When death is as complete as it should be, the individualexpands and fulfils himself in all directions; it is an omniform Samadhi. This is of course 'eternal ecstasy' in thesense already explained. But in the time-world Karma reconcentrates the elements, and a new incarnation occurs.45. There is death for the dogs.The prigs, the prudes, the followers of the dead letter of religions, die in a real sense of the word; for although eventhey are 'Stars', there is not enough body to them (as it were) to carry on the individuality. There is no basis for themagical memory if one's incarnation holds nothing worth remembering. Count your years by your wounds —forsitam haec climmeminesse juvabit.Serious readers should check Liber Aleph, 192-194.46. Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?This verse brings out what is a fact in psychology, the necessary connection between fear, sorrow, and failure. Towill and to dare are closely linked Powers of the Sphinx, and they are based on—to know. If one have a rightapprehension of the Universe, if he know himself free, immortal, boundless, infinite force and fire, then may he willand dare. Fear, sorrow and failure are but phantoms.47. Where I am these are not.Hadit is everywhere (See verse 3); fear, sorrow, and failure are only 'shadows'. It is for this reason that compassion isabsurd.It may be objected that 'shadows' exist, after all; the 'pink rats' of an alcoholic are not to be exorcised by 'ChristianScience' methods. Very true — they are, in fact, necessary functions of our idea of the Universe in its dualistic'shadow-show'. But they do not form any part of Hadit, who is beneath all conditions. And they are in a sense lessreal than their logical contradictories, because they are patently incompatible with the Changeless and Impersonal.They have their roots in conceptions involving change and personality. Strictly speaking, 'joy' is no less absurd thansorrow, with reference to Hadit; but from the standpoint of the individual, this is not the case. One's fear of death isremoved by the knowledge that there is no such thing in reality; but one's joy in life is not affected.48. Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not: I hate the consoled & the consoler.It is several times shewn in this Book that 'falling' is in truth impossible. 'All is ever as it was'. To sympathize withthe illusion is not only absurd, but tends to perpetuate the false idea. It is a mistake to 'spoil' a child, or humour amalade imaginaire. One must, on the contrary, chase away the shadows by lighting a fire, which fire is: Do whatthou wilt!"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Some technical aspects of this verse should be mentioned. \"Hadit never knew them\"—Hadit was never manifested intheir Ruach—to them he exists only as \"Not\" The consciousness of Hadit is only possible to those whose Ajna hasbecome active, even if for just one moment. \"Hadit consoles not\"—Hadit, of course, is the a biding Flame of Life thatmakes manifestation, even of the \"fallen'; possible. Though they are not conscious of Him, He is in them. See LXV,iii, 36. But for the same reason, He \"hates\" those who console and those who let themselves be consoled. To feardeath is to blaspheme against Life, and your own Spiritual Intuition—Gimel in the Qabalah—turns against you inscorn. It is for this reason that beggars hate the alms giver, and the alms giver, deep in his heart, despises thebeggar. This is a psychological fact, no matter how much well-intentioned fools may deny or conceal it. Cursesbrace your Soul—benedictions put you to sleep. Does your brother beg your help? Cast him into the snake pit andlaugh at his fear. He has nothing to fear but his fear. If he hate you, he would have hated you anyway. But he wouldhave hated and despised, and now he will hate and respect. And from respect for one's neighbour to respect forone's own self it is a small step. A man who can stand against you is a man you can lean upon, as said WilliamGibson, and the author of the Bhagavad Gita before him.It is not with these few well-chosen words that I look for praise from the United Givers Fund, the Salvation Army,and such other illustrious institutions.49. I am unique & conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned & dead! Amen. (This is ofthe 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am I as a babe in an egg.)I am not very well satisfied with the old comment on this verse (Published in the Equinox I, 7.) It appears rather as ifthe Amen should be the beginning of a new paragraph altogether. (That is not so; see the facsimile of the MMSS.)Amen is evidently a synthesis of the four elements, and the invisible fifth is Spirit. But Harpocrates, the Babe in theEgg, is Virgo in the Zodiac indeed, but Mercury among the planets. Mercury has the Winged Helmet and Heels, andthe Winged Staff about which Snakes twine, and it is He that Goeth. Now, this letter is Beth, whose numeration is 2,and AMEN is 91, which added to 2 makes 93. Amoun is of course Jupiter in his highest Form. To understand thisnote fully one must have studied 'The Paris Working'; also one must be an initiate of the 0. T. 0. (The italics areCrowley's, not ours.)\"I am unique & conqueror.\" This is obvious from the nature of Hadit. Those who are conscious of being Hadit mustbe doing their True Wills, and in such a case they either will find no obstacles in their path, or they will conquersuch obstacles as they may find. \"All the world loves a winner\"—but only a winner that wins according to Nuit'srule: \"But always unto me.\" Those who win foully provoke disharmony in themselves and in their surroundings. AsLincoln said, \"You may deceive some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but you can'tdeceive all of the people all of the time.\" See Emerson's essay, \"The Oversoul.\"\"I am not of the slaves that perish.\" This has already been explained, Hadit being Not.\"Be they damned\"—Be they sent to hell. Hell, of course, is the Abode of Had it—t he flame that burns in every heartof man. Also, HELL = H + L + L = 65, the Number of Adonai.\"& dead\". \"yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.\" Those who can't \"know Hadit\"—which ofcourse is the same as being known by Hadit, since you ARE Hadit — in life in manifestation, do so when the Serpentfinishes eating its own tail.'Amen.\" This is the signature of the sentence, the Amen in this case being the same Amen that speaks to the\"churches\" in Revelations. This is, of course, one of the pseudonyms, or Magickal Mottoes, of Aiwass, who was theHierophant in the Past Aeon. In the past Aeon only the Four Elements had been, so to speak, \"published\". TheElement of Spirit-—A kasha, that \"vast, black brooding ocean of death'; was concealed.50. Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in my eyes; & my spangles are purple &green.There is here suggested the Image of 'the Star and the Snake'.Nothing of the sort. See Liber HAD."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"51. Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight.There is a certain suggestion in this 'purple' as connected with 'eyesight' which should reveal a certain identity ofHadit with the Dwarf-Soul to those who possess—eyesight!52. There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall ofdeath: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words:these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter.Mohammed struck at the root of the insane superstition of tabu with his word: \"Women are your field; go in untothem as ye will.\" He only struck half the blow. I say: go in unto them as ye will and they will. Two-thirds of modernmisery spring from Woman's sexual dissatisfaction. (Readers will please note that this was written in the earlyTwenties, almost forty years before the Kinsey Report on women tore down the veil of male hypocrisy in Americansociety!) A dissatisfied woman is a curse to herself and to everybody in her neighbourhood. Women must learn to letthemselves enjoy without fear or shame, and both men and women must be trained in the technique of sex. Sex-repression leads to neurosis, and is the cause of social unrest. Ignorance of sexual technique leads to disappointment,even where passion is free and unrestrained. Sex is not everything in life, any more than food is: but until peoplehave got satisfaction of these natural hungers, it is useless to expect them to think of other things. This truth is vitalto the statesman, now that women have some direct political power; they will certainly overthrow the Republicunless they obtain full sexual satisfaction. Also, women outnumber men; and one man cannot satisfy a woman unlesshe be skilful and diligent. The New Aeon will have a foundation of Happy Women: a Woman under Tabu isloathsome to Life, detested by her fellows, and wretched in herself.The student should study in Liber Aleph and Liber 418 the connection between 'modesty' and the attitude of the'Black Brothers'.The 'Black Brothers' frequently use restricted women and pederasts as instruments. By pederasts we here meanpersons who are apparently of the male sex, but are attracted only by their own sex, and try to make of themselves aparody of femininity.The reason why the 'Black Brethren' can use such people as instruments is that restricted women do not function aswomen, and the 'swish' does not function as a man. Consequently, their astral bodies are unbalanced, and mayeasily be penetrated or infected by diseased currents.The 'Black Brothers' hate and fear Woman. They have a partial and fixed vision of Her, and refuse to see Her in HerTrue Nature. This is a consequence of that mental attitude psychoanalysts call the Oedipus Complex, but which theystudy and interpret, of course, on a very limited plane.The mechanism of the complex is very simple. The first woman to whose magnetism a boy is subjected is, as a rule,his mother. She is his first love, and also his first hatred, for it is she who watches him and punishes him when hewants to do something \"wrong\"—t hat is, when he wants to express his Self in a way that offends her prejudices. Theartificial restraints that modern, antinatural living imposes, the atavic influence of the slave-gods, the sexualdissatisfaction of the great majority of women in restricted societies, all this contributes to little patience in motherswith their children. The offspring is often punished for deeds that in reality deserve reward, since they demonstratecourage, initiative and high spirits.The child takes on this mixture of affection and resentment for the mother, and when the sexual instinct begins tosurface—it surfaces much earlier than the prudish like to believe-the mother is the son's first sexual fixation. Nowthe factor of the incest tabu comes in. The natural tendency of an adolescent boy is towards a girl of his age; but inrestricted societies, on reaching puberty he is separated from girls and associates easily only with his mother. Thenatural physical attraction, which takes no account of tab us, naturally impels him to the sexual object of the othersex which is available. But the atavic and \"educational\" inhibitions become active, and increase animosity towardsthe mother without satisfying the attraction he feels. (In point of fact, there is no a priori physiological objection toincest. Sexual relations between relatives do not automatically produce \"monsters\". They simply tend to incrementcommon traits. If these traits are \"good\", the product will be \"better\" than both. If these traits are \"bad'; the productwill be \"worse\". Animal breeders frequently couple sons with mothers, fathers with daughters, and brothers with"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"sisters, in order to improve advantageous genetic traits in a breed.The only valid objection to incest is psychological: there is a possibility that a boy weak in virility will become aslave to the Oedipus complex the rest of his life. But in such cases, the same risk would occur with any woman. Andif the boy is healthy, the physical relationship may in many cases dissolve the complex, satisfying the attraction,cancelling the animosity, equilibrating the tension, after which naturally the boy will interest himself in otherpartners —and so will the mother!...)The animic structure of a person who has any tendency to become a 'Black Brother' generally shows some seriousweakness combined with an excess in some other direction. Every man and every woman is, and should be, thecenter of the Universe to himself or herself This is given by the Consciousness of the Self But every man and everywoman animically well-balanced understands that every other human being has exactly the same right to considerhimself or herself the center. If we are healthy, we understand that, although for us our neighbour is but part of ourUniverse, for him we are but part of his. Students are referred to Liber NV, vv. 9-11, for a better understanding ofthe ethical aspect of this realization. If two human beings have this perception, the relation between them willeventually become harmonious. Any friction will be accidental and ephemeral. 'As brothers fight ye!\" There is nopossibility of permanent friction, because each of them is occupied with the realization of his True Will, and sinceeach of us is (no matter how many point s in common we may have) in a diverse position in some fundamental point,two True Wills CANNOT be in permanent conflict! Friction — if there is friction — is solved by \"love under will\"—which may, of course, include a fight. Any change is a form of Love. But the moment adjustment is produced, therewill cease to be exploitation on either side, since both understand that compensated exchange is necessary to thefreedom of both. And the understanding that both have of themselves and of the Universe will have been enriched bythe conflict. Both will have been modified by Love.The Black Brother has only half of this perception. He understands that he is the center of his universe; but he doesnot understand that he is only part of the universe of his neighbour. What is more, he does not will to understand.Students will please note that this attitude is not incompatible with shows of \"kindness\" or \"pity\". The worst BlackBrothers are \"kind\" and \"compassive\". We say \"worst\" from the point of view of their slaves; \"a chain of flowers ismore dangerous than a chain of iron.\"You can never tell beforehand if this or that person will become a \"Black Brother'; and how long he or she willremain so. There is a factor infinite and unknown. What is necessary is that you understand the motive why the\"Black Brethren\" do not will to understand that every man and every woman is a star. It is because they interpretthis as a diminution of the importance of their own selves. They are horrified by Binah, which they sense as a hostileinfluence. Binah wants to destroy them. Binah is Darkness, Blindness, Annihilation, Death!Readers will perhaps understand this better through an analogy. Remember occasions when you were very sick,hypersensitive, or near a nervous breakdown, when a loud noise, a sudden light, or a visitor wishing to make smalltalk irritated you or made you afraid. Physical health is extremely important to the initiatic process, for the mind issubjected to enormous strains in trances or magickal operations. If the body is not healthy, the mind may becomeunbalanced, and this in planes so subtle that they escape completely to perception by vulgar psychiatry. There arecompletely \"normal\" people on the intellectual and emotional planes who are nevertheless \"morally\" insane. Andpeople whose development on the \"moral\" plane —Buddhi-Manas — Neschamah —is rudimentary, that is, the greatmajority of mankind, are like clay in the hands of such madmen or madwomen.ft is necessary also that Students should understand what is the true position of the \"Black Brother'; from the pointof view of the Supernals. The \"Black Brother'; becomes an evil force in the world. But \"evil\" is relative. The \"BlackBrother\" would have no power over his fellowmen if his fellowmen had already reached that degree of self-awareness that makes us repel from us any enslaving influence. Our fellowmen, in their majority, have not reachedsuch a level of inner freedom. Consequently, they knuckle under the influence of the \"Black Brethren\"—and throughthe harm this influence does them, they slowly purify and equilibrate the sheaths of the self, start aspiring toemancipation, and eventually become capable of facing the Horror, the Abomination of Desolation—their ownSelves.Thus, from the point of view of the Supernals, although the \"Black Brother\" becomes a demon, this demon bows itshead to CHORONZON —333—and becomes a blind instrument of Destiny. His activity helps the work of the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Masters of the Temple. He is forced to work for Mankind in spite of himself \"Choronzon\" is that influence thatdestroys the ego—which is precisely what the Aspirant to True Initiation desires. Students are advised to read Liber156 with extreme care, and to consult Liber 418, the Tenth Aethyr, which describes the circumstances in whichChoronzon manifests itself, and the attitude that forces Choronzon to obey.BABALON is the Woman as THERION is the Man. We are all man and woman inside ourselves. The concept ofWoman as an entity that shuts itself is the product of the fear that the \"Black Brothers\" have of the universe. Whobows to the tabu of incest, or who fears love, tends to visualize the \"Mother\" as \"Pure,\" \"Virgin,\" \"Untouchable,\"\"Untouched.\" This concept is partial and erroneous. There are two ways in which a substance may be kept in a\"pure\" condition. First, it may be enclosed, shut up, in such a manner that it will be unable to mix with others.Second, it may be a substance so strong, so indestructible, that it cannot be contaminated by any other. A diamondmay fall into mud; it will go on being a diamond. Gold does not rust nor is easily attacked by acids as other metals.It is for this that both diamond and gold have been chosen by Adepts of past ages as symbols of Our True InnerIdentity—Ourselves-—HADIT.Two points of view, you understand. One is partial, limited, and leads the \"Black Brother\" to shut himself up andinterpret every extraneous influence as an attack against his integrity. The other leads the Adept Exempt to openhimself to the world, and to swear to interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing between God and his soul.Let it be understood that the Immaculate Virgin is a necessary concept; but it must be equilibrated by the oppositeconcept, since no idea that is not thus balanced by its opposite can exist above the Abyss. See Liber XXV, and LiberV, and Liber XXX VI. BABALON in Greek is MAPIE, Maria. She is the Immaculate Virgin, the Woman Clothed withthe Sun—Maia with the solar \"R\" in her womb. But she is SIMULTANEOUSLY the Great Whore, the Shameless Onewho gets drunk on the blood of the saints. She is Nature, whose mystery is eternally inviolate, the Veiled Isis; andshe is the Diana of the Ephesians, frenetically copulating with, and giving suck to, all her creatures: Isis Unveiled,the Heavenly and Earthly Venus. Beyond them, uniting their aspects in a single Female Symbol, is Isis Urania—NUIT.The concept of \"Mary inviolate\" is thus partial and unbalanced— and for this motive is qliphotic, unless it bechecked by its opposite. The Greeks sensed this. Artemis was the Virgin Goddess, patroness of maidens. She hadnever submitted to the embrace of any god but Pan—and one of the great riddles of Eleusis was that Artemis, havingsurrendered herself to PAN—that is, to ALL—remained pure and virgin.This is also what was meant by that aphorism: \"Who wishes to keep his life, shall lose it. Who loses it, shall gaineternal life.\"Every woman of false chastity is subject to the influence of the \"Black Brethren'; as are those homosexuals of thetype that tries to resemble a woman. Such people deny expression to the opposite polarity of their nature. Whatattracts a man to a woman is, odd as this may seem to the profane, his own femininity, as what attracts a woman to aman is her own masculinity. The polarity of the vehicles is inverted. This subject is too complex for treatment here,but remember the Mark of Set, the Mark of Satan, the Mark of the Beast: Moon and Sun conjoined.\"Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries.\" It is most necessary that false modesty be eradicated from the animiclife of our race. The only way to do this is to balance it by its opposite. A nun, be it Roman Catholic, Buddhist, or ofany other cult, is not a chaste woman if she automatically abstains from sexual intercourse. She is a coward, and herinfluence in society is always an evil influence. What use if Sisters of Charity-the least useless of such women—fightdisease in the world, when the greater part of such disease is provoked precisely by the ill effect their \"vows\"produce in the animic life of society? It is as if a man dammed a flowing brook, then kept busily disinfecting thestagnant pools resulting from the obstruction. This kind of psychic blindness is characteristic of the mental state ofthe \"Black Brothers.\"It is a wicked and senseless folly to believe that God can be found only out of, and beyond, our neighbor's flesh. It isfatally false to form an astral image of our Guardian Angel, instead of to perceive that He is equally manifested inall things. See LXV, iii, 25-39.Aspirants should keep in mind that the concept of \"Mary inviolate\" is a telepathic projection of the inner state of the\"Black Brothers\". Thelemites must fight to the utmost atavic tendencies in themselves to consider a \"chaste\" woman"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"a virtuous woman. A virtuous woman is she who has the courage to meet life on all planes, who has the courage tobe mistress and mother. A woman who shuts herself up, who castrates herself psychically, deserves only that scornthat we must reserve for all cowards. As long as \"nuns\" and \"chaste\" women are treated with more socialconsideration than \"adulteresses\" and \"promiscuous\" girls, the sex-life of mankind will remain stunted, and thefactors that most contribute to the formation of enslaving traumas will continue to manifest in the psychicatmosphere of the race. The concept of woman as a thing that \"shuts itself up\" comes from inside the \"BlackBrethren\"—who really have shut themselves up. Their souls shut upon themselves, refuse to become open to theinfluence of their fellowmen, to the influence of the Whole, Pan.Any form of sexual intercourse is permissible. Any occasional voluntary abstention is understandable. But the layingdown of rules of sexual behavior, or abstention of a healthy attraction due to prejudices of race, caste, or religion,are an abomination against Beauty and Love, BABALON and THERION, Woman and Man. Love is the law, loveunder will.53. Fear not, o prophet, when these words are said, thou shalt not be sorry. Thou art emphatically my chosen;and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt look upon with gladness. But I will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: theythat see thee shall fear thou art fallen: but I lift thee up.Yes! I was frightened when the God of Things as They Ought to Be told me that They Were to Be. I was born undera German Queen, and I did not believe in the Revolution that I willed. And lo! it is upon us, ere the Fifteenth Year ofthe New Aeon has dawned. (This was thus written in 1918 e.v.)Yes! I am lifted up, the Sun being in Scorpio in this Fourteenth Year of the Aeon.Students are referred to LXV, 4 12-24 and the Commentaries thereon. Also to Liber VII, i, 14, 22-28, 52-55; ii, 11-12, 17-22; iii, 16, 21,40-44,56-60; iv, 22-25,48; v, 7,34-48; vi, 22-25,47-50; vii, 4-6, 18- 20, 28-33, 36-39, 43-44.54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail; thou shall reveal it: thou availest:they are the slaves of because: They are not of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in styleor value!The second part of the text was in answer to an unspoken query as to the peculiar phrasing.The first part is clear enough. There are a number of people of shallow wit who do not believe in Magick. This isdoubtless partly due to the bad presentation of the subject by previous Masters. I have identified Magick with the Artof Life. The transcendental superstructure will not overburden those who have laid this Right Foundation.There is an elaborate cryptographic meaning in this verse; the words 'folly','nought','it', and 'me' indicate the path ofresearch.The meaning should be clear from our previous notes.55. Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attributethem unto.The attribution in Liber Trigrammaton is good theoretically; but no Qabalah of merit has arisen therefrom. (Surely itis a little early for that; a good Qabalah may take a few hundred years to unfold.) I am inclined to look further intothe question of Sanskrit Roots, and into the Enochian Records, in order to put this matter in more polished shape.I append Liber Trigrammaton with the attribution aforesaid:LIBER TRIGRAMMATONsub figura XXVIITHE BOOK OF THE TRIGRAMSOF THEMUTATIONS OF THE TAO WITH THEYIN AND THE YANG"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"I Here is Nothing under its three forms.

Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh not long: then when ye are sadknow that I have forsaken you.These passages are certainly very difficult. It seems as if they were given to meet some contingency which has notyet arisen. For example, this verse might be appropriate in case of the institution of a false cultus by impostors.The doctrine is that Hadit is the nucleolus (to borrow a term from biology) of any star-organism. To mock at Hadit istherefore evidently very much what is meant by the mysterious phrase in the 'New Testament' with regard to the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Unpardonable Sin, the 'blasphemy against the Holy Ghost'. A star forsaken by Hadit would thus be in the conditionof real death. It is this state which is characteristic of the 'Black Brothers', as they are described in other parts of thisComment, and elsewhere in the Holy Books of the A.'.A.'.It is not necessarily Had it who is speaking; it may be Aiwass, the Magus of the Past Aeon. In which case the versebecomes perfectly clear. Aleister Crowley was mocked and is still mocked, twenty years after his death; hispretensions to Lordship of the Aeon are held laughable, his \"followers\" are held in scorn. Yet, what has been thehistory of the established churches and \"occult\" orders since He came? They run around in circles at this moment,trying to grasp reality, and fail at every turn. Their shrines are truly empty; the God has left them. They spat at thesun, and their spittle fell back upon their faces.57. He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall be filthy still.This, and the first part of the next verse demonstrate the inviolability of Hadit our Quintessence. Every Star has itsown Nature, which is 'right' for it. We are not to be missionaries with ideal standards of dress and morals, and suchhard-ideas. We are to do what we will, and leave others to do what they will. We are infinitely tolerant, save ofintolerance.It is impossible to alter the ultimate Nature of any Being, however completely we may succeed in transfiguring itsexternal signs as displayed in any of its combinations. Thus, the sweetness, whiteness, and crystalline structure ofsugar depend partly on the presence of Carbon; so do the bitterness, greenness, and resinous composition of hashish.But the Carbon is inviolably Carbon. And even when we transmute what seem to be elements, as Radium to Lead,we merely go a step further; there is still an immutable substance — or essence of Energy — which is inevitablyItself, the basis of the diversity.This holds good even should we arrive at demonstrating Material Monism. It may well be — I have believed so eversince I was fourteen years old — that the elements are all isomers, differentiated by geometrical structure, electricalcharge, or otherwise in precisely the same way as ozone from oxygen, red from yellow phosphorus, dextrose fromlaevulose, and a paraffin from a benzene of identical empirical formula. Indeed, every 'star' is necessarily derivedfrom the uniform continuity of Nuit, and resolvable back into Her Body by the proper analytical methods, as theexperience of mysticism testifies. But each such complex is none the less uniquely itself; for the scheme of itsconstruction is part of its existence, so that this peculiar scheme constitutes the essence of its individuality. It isimpossible to change a shilling into two sixpences, though the value and the material may be identical; for part of theessence of the shilling is the intention to have a single coin.The above considerations must be thoroughly assimilated by any mind which wishes to gain a firm intellectual graspof the truth which lies behind the paradox of existence.We may now go one step further: geneticists have found that the genetic code is uniform throughout all protoplasm;only its permutations determine whet her such and such organism will become a slug rather than a man. Yet, there isa factor infinite and unknown, and the 'star' analogy must not be taken too far. Human beings are living organismsin the process of change, which is life. Individual change is called Initiation; racial initiation is called Evolution; butchange there is. The point is, and this must be understood, that you must change from your present position, and notanother. The acceptance of the Law of Thelema will not make a king out of a beggar. The \"promises\" in Liber AL of'store of women and spices; 'rich jewels', rule; 'victorious armies; 'all the joy; are not to be interpreted as \"promisesto the faithful\". They are merely predictions of the future of a Thelemic society.This is further argument against interference with another's will. Your neighbor is a vile, wicked man? Leave him tohis way as long as he does not interfere with yours. A thousand years hence, his disreputable qualities, that you sodisapprove now, may be vital for racial survival, while people with your qualities may be going the way oflemmings. See LXV, iv, 47.58. Yea! deem not of change: ye shall be as ye are, & not other. Therefore the kings of the earth shall be Kingsfor ever: the slaves shall serve. There is none that shall be cast down or lifted up: all is ever as it was. Yetthere are masked ones my servants: it may be that yonder beggar is a King. A King may choose his garmentas he will: there is no certain test: but a beggar cannot hide his poverty."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Again we learn the permanence of the Nature of a Star. We are not to judge by temporary circumstances, but topenetrate to the True Nature.It has naturally been objected by economists that our Law, in declaring every man and every woman to be a star,reduces society to its elements, and makes hierarchy or even democracy impossible. The view is superficial. Eachstar has a function in its galaxy proper to its own nature. Much mischief has come from our ignorance in insisting, onthe contrary, that each citizen is fit for any and every social duty. But also our Law teaches that a star often veilsitself from its nature. Thus the vast bulk of humanity is obsessed by an abject fear of freedom; the principalobjections hitherto urged against my Law have been those of people who cannot bear to imagine the horrors whichwould result if they were free to do their own wills. (Such people mistake, of course, their repressions for theirWills.) The sense of sin, shame, self-distrust, this is what makes folk cling to slavery. People believe in a medicinejust in so far as it is nasty; the metaphysical root of this idea is in sexual degeneracy of the masochistic type. Now,\"the Law is for all\"; but such defectives will refuse it, and serve us who are free with a fidelity the more dog-like asthe simplicity of our freedom denotes their abjection.Totally wrong. Only a free man can be a true servant — if he Will to serve. Such defectives will fight us at everyturn, and betray us at every step. He who is unfaithful to himself cannot help being unfaithful to you. Who fastens achain to a slave's neck must hold the tip in his hand. The more slaves, the more chain-tips;pretty soon the master ismore fettered than the slaves. This is the state of the 'Black Brothers'.No one is better aware than I am that the Labour Problem has to be settled by practical and not ideal considerations,but in this case the ideal considerations happen to be extremely practical. The mistake has been in trying to producea standard article to supply the labour market; it is an error from the point of view of capital and labour alike. Menshould not be taught to read and write unless they exhibit capacity or inclination. Compulsory education has aidednobody. It has imposed an unwarrantable constraint on the people it was intended to benefit; it has been asininepresumption on the part of the intellectuals to consider a smattering of mental acquirements of universal benefit. It isa form of sectarian bigotry. We should recognize the fact that the vast majority of human beings have no ambition inlife beyond mere ease and animal happiness. We should allow these people to fulfil their destinies withoutinterference. We should give every opportunity to the ambitious, and thereby establish a class of morally andintellectually superior men and women. We should have no compunction in utilizing the natural qualities of the bulkof mankind. We do not insist on training sheep to hunt foxes or lecture on history; we look after their physical wellbeing, and enjoy their wool and mutton. In this way we shall have a contented class of slaves. (Poor ass! Slaves arenever satisfied;only free men are content in their places, provided they are respected as men, and their workrecognized.) who will accept the conditions of existence as they really are, and enjoy life with the quiet wisdom ofcattle. It is our duty to see to it that this class of people lack for nothing. The patriarchal system is better for allclasses than any other; the objections to it come from the abuses of it. But bad masters have been artificially createdby exactly the same blunder as was responsible for the bad servants. It is essential to teach the masters that each onemust discover his own will, and do it. There is no reason in nature for cut-throat competition. All this has beenexplained previously in other connections; here it is only necessary to emphasize the point. It must be clearlyunderstood that every man must find his own happiness in a purely personal way. Our troubles have been caused bythe assumption that everybody wanted the same things, and thereby the supply of those things has become artificiallylimited; even those benefits of which there is an inexhaustible store have been cornered. For example, fresh air andbeautiful scenery. In a world where everyone did his own will none would lack these things. In our present society,they have become the luxuries of wealth and leisure, yet they are still accessible to any one who possesses sufficientsense to emancipate himself from the alleged advantages of city life. We have deliberately trained people to wish forthings that they do not really want.It would be easy to elaborate this theme at great length, but I prefer to leave it to be worked out by each reader in thelight of his own intelligence, but I wish to call the very particular attention of capitalists and labour leaders to theprinciples here set forth.You don't catch flies with vinegar, and I doubt that labour leaders would care to have their sheep openly calledsuch. Nor is the patriarchal system the best; if so, why not the matriarchal? The hierarchic system is best, such asCommunist Russia has evolved, or armies everywhere, or the old orders of chivalry. The problem consists, in anycase, in keeping class divisions sufficiently fluid. The ruling class must never become fixed; it must be always readyto admit members of the ruled classes who prove themselves fit to rule, and it must be always ready to demote from"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"itself members of itself that prove themselves unfit to do so. Otherwise, though it may last centuries, it will go theway of all aristocracies.Readers are invited to consult the following chapters of Liber Aleph on this subject: 31, 32, 33, 39.There is a technical aspect to this verse that should be considered. 'Acceptance of the Law\"does not put youautomatically in the \"ruling class\". If you are a street-sweeper, you will remain a street-sweeper, unless your TrueWill is to become something else. As the Alchemists rudely put it, you must have gold to make gold;you change fromyour present position in space and time, not from another's. Therefore, Initiation does not produce a change ofsocial class; it merely improves the efficiency with which you handle your inherited and acquired qualities, it doesnot give you new qualities. You don't grow a pointed tail, or horns. You remain what you are. \"I Am That IAm\"—and not something else. You seem to change only to the mind, because it never knew You, or itself, for thatmatter. And even the mind, as soon as it calms down (it takes years, in some cases), perceives that all is ever as itwas. Those who were already kings, that is, members of a ruling class—ANY ruling class—become Kings, that is,true rulers. Those who were slaves become servants—and by serving learn the way to freedom. Which brings us tothe single case in which Initiation may bring an automatic change: the case of \"none'; that is, \"nobody'; NEMO—the Master of the Temple. He may be cast down or lifted up —he may become a \"Morning or an Evening Star\".But this happens, so to speak, effortlessly, as by gravitation. It is a case apart. In practice, you remain exactly whatyou are, and any changes you produce in your environment, you produce by your own sweat, under the addedhandicap that you must fight as an honorable Knight, while slaves, Christians, Orthodox Jews, Buddhists,Mohammedans, etc. may go on fighting as the petty, insane, unclean, lecherous, treacherous, silly idiots that theyare.59. Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King concealed! Say you so? Fool! If he be a King, thoucanst not hurt him.We should indeed love all — is not the Law \"love under will\"? By this I mean that we should make proper contactwith all, for love means union; and the proper condition of union is determined by Will. Consider the right attitude toadopt in the matter of cholera. One should love it, that is, study it intimately; not otherwise can one be sure ofmaintaining the right relation with it, which is, not to allow it to interfere with one's will to live.Readers will have noticed that Liber AL does not order them to \"Love your neighbor as yourself'. This\"Commandment\" was unctuously proclaimed by some silly Rabbi in Palestine, and picked up eagerly byslaves—who want very much to beloved, since they fear that, unless they are loved, they will be eaten up by freemen. Slaves do not realize that free men, as a rule, are fastidious about their diet, and don't feed on carrion. It isonly \"Black Brothers\" who delight on it. De gustibus non est disputandum.Liber AL makes a very careful distinction about whom you should and whom you should not consider loveworthy.See 1, 10-12, 21, 31, 40-49, 51-52, 57, 61-62; II, 17-25.Most people, alas, must be treated by you as if they had the cholera. See Liber VII, ii, 2 7-33.There is an aristocracy of the spirit, and those who belong to it instinctively recognize each other. When they err, itis usually on the side of the angels, so to speak. Being noble, they tend to see nobility everywhere. They are few, andyearn for their peers. They give beggars the benefit of the doubt. \"Compassion is the vice of kings.\"This tendency must be strictly avoided. The only efficient way to deal with mankind at large is to treat every man orwoman you meet as a potential beggar asking for alms — which means, in this technical sense, a \"Bloody Sacrifice\".Those who aren't beggars will quickly make the fact known, if they will. The important point is that you should notcome to harm through your own folly of believing that lie: That Thou Must Die for them. On the contrary, Thou mustlive. Let them die in their misery!The social aspect of this verse has been sensed by a woman writer. Ayn Rand, and developed in two works of fictionworthy of perusal by Thelemites: The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Although her reasoning is often mixed-upor naive, she grasped the main point well enough.60. Therefore strike hard & low, and to hell with them, master!"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"One must never be so careless as to let oneself think that even the \"style of the letter\" (how much less a phrase!) inthis Book is casual. The expression \"to hell with them\" is not merely an outburst of colloquial enthusiasm. The word\"hell\", that and no other, serves the purpose of the speaker. This would naturally be suggested to us, in any case, bythe reflection that our Law does not indulge in the frothings of impotent fury, like the priestly frauds of Moses, theRishis, and Buddha, in the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth of the Galilean fishwife. Our Law knowsnothing of punishment beyond that imposed by ignorance and awkwardness on their possessor. The word \"hell\"must therefore be explained in terms neither of virile vulgarity, or theological blackmail. See Liber Aleph, 124, 129,130.61. There is a light before thine eyes, o prophet, a light undesired, most desirable.This chapter now enters upon an entirely new phase. The revelation or 'hiding' of Hadit had by now sunk into thesoul of The Beast, so that He realized Himself.See Liber HAD.62. I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thy body.\"Uplifted in thine heart\": compare the Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent. (Liber LXV.)63. Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, morerapid and laughterful than a caress of Hell's own worm.This verse conceals a certain Magical Formula of the loftiest initiation. It refers to a method of using the breath, inconnexion with the appropriate series of ideas, which is perhaps not to be taught directly. But it may be learnt bythose who have attained the necessary degree of magical technique, suggested automatically to them by Natureherself, just as newly-hatched chickens pick up corn without instruction.See Liber HAD. \"Hell's own worm\" is, of course, Had it.64. Oh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee: hail! hail: prophet of Nu! prophet ofHad! prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu! Now rejoice! now come in our splendour & rapture! Come in our passionatepeace, & write sweet words for the Kings!The \"Kings\" are evidently those men who are capable of understanding Themselves. This is a consecration of TheBeast to the task of putting forth the Law.\"Thou art overcome\": the conscious resisted desperately, and died in the last ditch.65. I am the Master: thou art the Holy Chosen One.It is curious that this verse should be numbered 65, suggesting L.V.X.(LUX) and Adonai, the Holy Guardian Angel.It seems then that He is Hadit. (The Angel is Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Also everything else —Nuit, again. SeeLXV, iii, 31-33. Here it is Aiwass speaking.) I have never liked the term 'Higher Self'; True Self is more the idea. Foreach Star is the husk of Hadit, unique and conqueror, sublime in His own virtue, independent of Hierarchy. There isan external hierarchy, of course, but that is only a matter of convenience.66. Write, & find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! Thrill with the joy of life & death! Ah!thy death shall be lovely: whoso seeth it shall be glad. Thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our agelonglove. Come! lift up thine heart & rejoice! We are one; we are none.The first part of this text appears to be a digression in the nature of a prophecy. The word \"Come!\" is a summons toreenter the full Trance. Its essence is declared in the last six words. Notice that the transition from one to none isinstantaneous.67. Hold! Hold! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the excellent kisses!"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The instructions in the text of this and the next verse were actual indications as to how to behave so as to get the fulleffect of the Trance.This too is a general Magical Formula, convenient even in the Work of the physical image of the Godhead. (What hemeans is that the formula is an excellent adjuvant to sexual intercourse.)It is of the utmost importance to resist the temptation to let oneself be carried away into trance (or orgasm). Oneshould summon one's reserve forces to react against the tendency to lose normal consciousness. More and more ofone's being is gradually drawn into the struggle, and one only yields at the last moment. It needs practice andcourage to get the best results. See LXV, i, 64 and iii, 38-48; Liber VII, i, 33.68. Harder! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep — die!It is remarkable that this extraordinary Experience had practically no effect upon the normal consciousness of TheBeast. \"Intoxicate the inmost, 0 my lover, not the outermost!\" — and it was His Magical Self, 666, that was by thisEcstasy initiated. It needed years for this Light to dissolve the husks of accident that shrouded his True Seed.69. Ah! Ah! What do I feel? Is the word exhausted?This phrase— \"the word\"—is of deeper significance than at first sight may appear. The question is not merelyequivalent to: \"Is the dictation at an end?\" For the Word is conceived as the act of possession. This is evident fromthe choice of the word \"exhausted\". The inspiration has been like an electrical discharge. Language is in itselfnothing; it is only the medium of transmitting experience to consciousness. Tahuti, Thoth, Hermes, or Mercurysymbolize this relation; the character of this God is declared in very full terms in \"The Paris Working\", which shouldbe studied eagerly by those who are fortunate enough to have access to the MS.70. There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be notanimal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed bydelicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein!It is absurd to suppose that 'to indulge the passions' is necessarily a reversion or degeneration. On the contrary, allhuman progress has depended on such indulgence. Every art and science is intended to gratify some fundamentalneed of nature. What is the ultimate use of the telephone and all the other inventions on which we pride ourselves?Only to sustain life, or to protect or reproduce it; or to subserve Knowledge and other forms of pleasure.On the other hand, the passions must be understood properly as what they are, nothing in themselves, but the diverseforms of expression employed by the Will. One must preserve discipline. A passion cannot be good or bad, too weakor too strong, etc., by an arbitrary standard. Its virtue consists solely in its conformity with the plan of theCommander-in-Chief. Its initiative and elan are limited by the requirements of his strategy. For instance, modestymay well cooperate with ambition; but also it may thwart it. This verse counsels us to train our passions to thehighest degree of efficiency. Each is to acquire the utmost strength and intelligence; but all are equally to contributetheir quota towards the success of the campaign.It is nonsense to bring a verdict of 'Guilty' or 'Not Guilty' against a prisoner, without reference to the Law underwhich he is living. The end justifies the means: if the Jesuits do not assert this, I do. There is obviously a limit,where 'the means' in any case are such that their use blasphemes 'the end': e.g., to murder one's rich aunt affirms theright of one's poor nephew to repeat the trick, and so to go against one s own Will-to-live, which lies deeper in one'sbeing than the mere Will-to-inherit. (There is a better consideration, which can be found in Liber Librae, v.20.) Thejudge in each case is not ideal morality, but inherent logic.This then being understood, that we cannot call any given passion good or bad absolutely, any more than we can callKnight to King's Fifth a good or bad move in chess without study of the position, we may see more clearly what thisverse implies. There is here a general instruction to refine Pleasure, not by excluding its gross elements, but byemphasizing all elements in equilibrated development. Thus one is to combine the joys of Messalina with those ofSaint Theresa and Isolde in one single act. One's rapture is to include those of Blake, Petrarch, Shelley, and Catullus.Liber Aleph has detailed instructions on numerous points involved in these questions."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Why \"eight and ninety\" rules of art? I am totally unable to suggest a reason satisfactory to myself; but 90 is Tzaddi,the 'Emperor', and 8 Cheth, the 'Charioteer' or Cup-Bearer; the phrase might then conceivably mean 'with majesty'.Alternatively, 98=2 x 49: now, Two is the number of the Will, and Seven of the passive senses. 98 might then meanthe full expansion of the senses (7 x 7) balanced against each other, and controlled firmly by the Will.Without in any way deriding the above Qabalistic explanation, which should be a guide to all Thelemites in searchof sensuous enjoyment, \"98 rules\" may refer to some aesthetic code in daily use in Ancient Egypt or Sumer or evenin the modern Middle East. Aiwass gets quite provincial at times.\"Exceed by delicacy\": this does not mean, by refraining from so- called animalism. One should make every act asacrament, full of divine ecstasy and nourishment. There is no act that true delicacy cannot consecrate. It is one thingto be like a sow, unconscious of the mire, and unable to discriminate between sweet food and sour; another to takethe filth firmly and force oneself to discover the purity therein, initiating even the body to overcome its naturalrepulsion and partake with the soul at this Eucharist. We \"believe in the Miracle of the Mass\" not only because meatand drink are actually \"transmuted in us daily into Spiritual Substance\", but because we can make the 'Body andBlood of God' from any materials soever by Virtue of our Royal and Pontifical Art of Magick.Now, when Brillat-Savarin (was it not?) served to the King's table a pair of old kid gloves, and pleased the princelypalate, he certainly proved himself a Master-Cook. The feat is not one to be repeated constantly, but one shouldachieve it at least once—that it may bear witness to oneself that the skill is there. One might even find it advisable topractice it occasionally, to retain one's confidence that one's 'right hand hath not lost its cunning'. See LXV, i, 45-46;ii, 7- 15.We therefore train our adepts to make the Gold Philosophical from the dung of witches, and the Elixir of Life fromHippomanes; but we do not advocate ostentatious addiction to these operations. It is good to know that one is manenough to spend a month or so at a height of twenty thousand feet or more above the sea-level; but it would beunpardonably foolish to live there permanently.This illustrates one case of a general principle. We consider the Attainment of various illuminations, incomparablyglorious as that is, of chief value for its witness to our possession of the faculty which made success possible. Tohave climbed alone to the summit of Iztaccihuatl is great and grand; but the essence of one's joy is that one possessesthe courage, knowledge, agility, endurance, and self- mastery necessary to have done it.The Goal is ineffably worth all our pains, as we say to ourselves at first; but in a little while are aware that even thatGoal is less intoxicating than the Way itself.We find that it matters little whither we go; the Going itself is our gladness. I quote in this connection Liber LXV, ii,17-25, one of several similar passages in Our Holy Books.\"Be strong!\" We need healthy robust bodies as the mechanical instruments of our souls. Could Paganini haveexpressed himself on the 'fiddle for eighteen pence' that some one once bought when he was 'young and had nosense'? Each of us is Hadit, the core of our Khabs, our Star, one of the Company of Heaven; but this Khabs needs aKhu or Magical Image, in order to play its part in the Great Drama. This Khu, again, needs the proper costume, asuitable 'body of flesh', and this costume must be worthy of the Play.We therefore employ various magical means to increase the vigour of our bodies and the energy of our minds, tofortify and to sublime them.The result is that we of Thelema are capable of enormously more achievement than others, even in terrestrialmatters, from sexual orgia to creative Art. Even if we had only this one earth-life to consider, we exceed our fellowssome thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, some an hundredfold.One most important point, in conclusion. We must doubtless admit that each one of us is lacking in one capacity oranother. There must always be some among the infinite possibilities of Nuit which possess no correlative points ofcontact in any given Khu. For example, the Khu of a male body cannot fulfil itself in the quality of motherhood. (Onthe material plane, of course.) Any such lacuna must be accepted as a necessary limit, without regret or vainyearnings for the impossible. (Although what is impossible now may not be impossible a hundred years hence. A"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"time may come when the characteristics ofone's physical body may be changed at will by purely scientific means.)But we should beware lest prejudice or other personal passion exclude any type of self-realization which is properlyours. In our initiation, the tests must be thorough and exhaustive. The neglect to develop even a single power canonly result in deformity. However slight this might seem, it might lead to fatal consequences; the ancient adeptstaught that by the parable of the heel of Achilles. It is essential for the Aspirant to make a systematic study of everypossible passion, icily aloof from all alike, and setting their armies in array beneath the banner of his Will after hehad perfectly gauged the capacity of each unit, and assured himself of its loyalty, discipline, courage, and efficiency.But woe unto him who leaves a gap in his line, or one arm unprepared to do its whole duty in the position proper toits peculiar potentialities!71. But exceed! exceed!\"The Road of Excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom.\" \"You never know what is enough until you know what is toomuch.\" So wrote William O'Neill (Blake).Progress, as its very etymology declares, means A Step Ahead. It is the Genius, the Eccentric, the Man Who GoesOne Better than his fellows, that is the Saviour of the Race. And while it is unwise possibly (in some senses) toexceed in certain respects, we may be sure that he who exceeds in no respect is a mediocrity. The key of Evolution isRight Variation.Excess is evidence at least of capacity in the quality at issue. The golf teacher growls tirelessly: \"Put for the back ofthe hole! Never up, never in!\" The application is universal. Far from me be it to deny that excess is too oftendisastrous. The athlete who dies in his early prime is the skeleton at every Boat Supper. But in such cases the excessis almost always due to the desire to excel other men, instead of referring the matter to the only competent judge, thetrue Will of the body. I myself used to 'go all out' on mountains; I hold more World's Records of various kinds than Ican reckon—for pace, skill, daring, and endurance. But I never worried about whether other people could beat me.For this reason my excesses, instead of causing damage to health and danger to life, turned me from a delicate boy,too frail for football, doomed by my doctors to die in my teens, into a robust ruffian who throve on every kind ofhardship and exposure.On the contrary, every department of life in which, from distaste or laziness, I did not 'exceed', is constantlycrippling me in one way or another—and I recognize with savage remorse that the weakness which I could havecorrected so easily in my twenties is in my forties an incurably chronic complaint.72. Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine—and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous!—death is thecrown of all.This striving is to be strenuous. We are not to set our lives at a pin's fee. \"Unhand me, gentlemen! I'll make a ghostof him that lets me!\" Death is the End that crowns the Work.Evolution works by variation. When an animal develops one part of itself beyond the others, it infringes the norm ofits type. At first this effort is made at the expense of other efforts, and it seems as if, the general balance being upset,the Nature were in danger. (It must obviously appear so to the casual observer—who probably reproaches andpersecutes the experimenter.) But when this variation is intended to meet some new, or even foreseen, change inenvironment, and is paid for by some surplus part, or some part now superfluous, although once useful to meet aquality of the environment which no longer menaces the individual, the adaptation is biologically profitable.Obviously, the whole idea of exercise, mental or bodily, is to develop the involved organs in a mannerphysiologically and psychologically proper.It is deleterious to force any faculty to live by an alien law. When parents insist on a boy adopting a professionwhich he loathes, because they themselves fancy it; when Florence Nightingale fought to open hospital windows inIndia at night; then the Ideal mutilates and murders.Every organ has 'no law beyond Do what thou wilt'. Its law is determined by the history of its development, and byits present relations with its fellow-citizens. We do not fortify our lungs and our limbs by identical methods, or aimat the same tokens of success in training the throat of the tenor and the fingers of the fiddler. But all laws are alike in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"this: they agree that power and tone come from persistently practising the proper exercise without overstraining.When a faculty is freely fulfilling its function, it will grow; the test is its willingness to 'strive ever to more'; itjustifies itself by being 'ever joyous'. It follows that 'death is the crown of all'. For a life which has fulfilled all itspossibilities ceases to have a purpose; death is its diploma, so to speak; it is ready to apply itself to the newconditions of a larger life. Just so a schoolboy who has mastered his work dies to school, reincarnates in cap &gown, triumphs in the tripos, dies to the cloisters, and is reborn to the world.Note that the Atu 'Death' in the Tarot refers to Scorpio. This sign is threefold: the Scorpion that kills itself with itsown poison, when its environment (the ring of fire) becomes intolerable; the Serpent that renews itself by sheddingits skin, that is crowned and hooded, that moves by undulations like Light, and gives man Wisdom at the price ofToil, Suffering, and Mortality; and the Eagle that soars, its lidless eyes bent boldly upon the Sun. 'Death' is, to theinitiate, an inn by the wayside; it marks a stage accomplished; it offers refreshment, repose, and advice as to hisplans for the morrow.But in this verse the main point is that death is the 'crown' of all. The crown is Kether, the Unity; \"Love under will\"having been applied to all Nuit-possibilities of all Khu-energies of any Hadit central-Star, that Star has exhausteditself perfectly, completed one stage of its course. It is therefore crowned by death; and, being wholly itself, livesagain by attracting its equal and opposite Counterpart, with whom 'love under will' is the fulfilment of the Law, in asublimer sphere.But there are no rules until one finds them; a man leaving Ireland for the Sahara does well to discard such'indispensable' and 'proper' things as a waterproof and a blackthorn for a turban and a dagger.The 'moral' man is living by the no-reason of Laws, and that is stupid and inadequate even when the Laws still holdgood; for he is a mere mechanism, resourceless should any danger that is not already provided for in his originaldesign chance to arise. Respect for routine is the mark of the second-rate man.This does not mean that routine is not proper and fitting in its place; but when routine —any routine —becomesDogma, someone's mind has curled up and gone to sleep. \"The law was made for man, not man for the law,\" is thevoice of commonsense.The 'immoral' man, defying convention by shouting aloud in church, may indeed be 'brawling'; but equally he maybe a sensitive who has felt the first tremor of an earthquake.We of Thelema encourage every possible variation; we welcome every new 'sport'; its success or failure is our soletest of its value. We let the hen's queer hatching take to water, and laugh at her alarms; and we protect the 'uglyduckling', knowing that Time will tell us whether it be a cygnet.Herbert Spencer, inexorably condemning the Unfit to the gallows, only echoed the High-Priest who protected Paulfrom the Pharisees. Sound biology and sound theology are for once at one!The question of the limits of individual Liberty is fully discussed in Liber Aleph, to which we refer the student. Thefollowing four chapters will give a general idea of the main principles: 36, 37, 38, 39.We of Thelema think it vitally right to let a man take opium. He may destroy his physical vehicle thereby (Thevehicle is his, not ours!) but he may produce another \"Kubla Khan\". It is his own responsibility. Also we know wellthat \"if he be a King\" it will not hurt him—in the end. We trust Nature to protect, and Wisdom to be justified of,their children. It is superficial to object that a man should be prevented from ruining and killing himself, for his ownsake or for that of 'those dependent on him'. One who is unfit to survive ought to be allowed to die. We want onlythose who can conquer themselves and their environment. As for 'those dependent on him', it is one of our chiefobjects to abolish the very idea of dependence on others. Women with child, and infants, are not exceptions, asmight seem. They are doing their will, the one class to reproduce, the other to live; the state should consider theirwelfare to be its first duty; for if they are for the moment dependent on it, it is also dependent on them. A man mightas well cut out his heart because it was weak, and in need of cautious care. But he would be no less foolish if he triedto prevent the used- up elements from eliminating themselves from his body. We respect the Will-to-live; we shouldrespect the Will-to-Die. The race is auto- intoxicated by suppressing the excretory processes of Nature."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Each case must of course be judged on its merits. His neighbours do well to assist one who is weak by accident ormisfortune, if he wishes to recover. But it is a crime against the state and against the individuals in question to hinderthe gambler, the drunkard, the voluptuary, the congenital defective, from drifting to death, unless they prove, by theirown dogged determination to master their circumstances, that they are fit to pull their weight in the Noah's Ark ofmankind.73. Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man, unto thee.There is a connection between Death, Sleep, and Our Lady Nuit. (This is worked out, on profane lines, by Dr.Sigmund Freud, and his school, especially by Jung, Psychology of the Unconscious, which the reader shouldconsult.) The fatigue of the day's toil creates the toxins whose accumulation is the 'Will to Die'. All mysticattainment is of this type, as all Magick is of the 'Will to Live'. At times we all want Nibbana, to withdraw into theSilence, and so on. The Art of it is to dip deeply into 'Death', but to emerge immediately, a giant refreshed. This planis also possible on the larger scale, all Life being Magick, all Death Mysticism.Then, why is Death 'forbidden'? All things are surely lawful. But we must work 'without lust of result', takingeverything as it comes without desire indeed, but with all manner of delight! Let thy Love- Madrigal to Death, thyMother-Mistress, ripple and swell throughout the years, with all the Starry Heaven for thine Orchestra; but do notimagine that to attain Her is the sole satisfaction. It is the yearning itself that is Beatitude.It may seem that in this verse the word 'Death' is used in a sense somewhat other than that explained in the previousnote. It is forbidden, observe, to 'man'. That is, then, the formula must not be used by one who is still an imperfectbeing. (Nonsense. Man is a star; most human beings function not as Men, but as demons, that is to say, unbalancedminds. Most of mankind has not reached the balancing and harmonization of Tiphereth; many have not reachedeven the partial equilibration of Tiphereth of Malkuth! 'Man' in the verse refers to 666, who finished His Work in hisearly forties, but for several Magickal reasons was forced to keep his physical link with this plane for thirty yearslonger. Of course, being in his thirties when he wrote the above Commentary, he did not understand this.) Ourdefinition is surely confirmed by this phrase, rather than denied, or even modified. To long for death is to aspire tothe complete fulfilment of all one's potentialities. And it would evidently be an error to insist upon passing on toone's next life while there were hawsers unhitched from this one. The mere inexplicability of the various jerks wouldmake for bewilderment, irritation, and clumsiness.For this reason, alone, it is all-important to ascertain one's true Will, and to work out every detail of the work ofdoing it, as early in life as one can. One is apt (at the best) to define one's will dogmatically, and to devote one's lifealmost puritanically to the task, sternly suppressing all side-issues, and calling this course Concentration. This iserror, and perilous. For one cannot be sure that a faculty which seems (on the surface) useless, even hostile, to one'swork, may not in course of time become one of vital value. If it be atrophied — alas! Its suppression may moreoverhave poisoned one's whole system, as a breast debarred from its natural use is prone to cancer. At best, it may be toolate to repair the mischief; the lost opportunity may be a life-long remorse.The one way of safety lies in applying the Law of Thelema with the utmost rigour. Every impulse, however feeble, isnecessary to the stability of the whole structure; the tiniest flaw may cause the cannon to burst. Every impulse,however opposite to the main motive, is part of the plan; the rifling does not thwart the purpose of the barrel. Oneshould therefore acquiesce in every element of one's nature, and develop it as its own laws demand, with absoluteimpartiality. One need not fear; there is a natural limit to the growth of any species; it either finds food fail, or ischoked by its neighbours, or overgrows itself, and is transformed. Nor need one fret about the harmony andproportion of one's various faculties; the fit will survive, and the perfection of the whole will be understood as soonas the parts have found themselves, and settled down after fighting the matter out in the balanced stability whichrepresents their right reaction to each other, and to their environment. It is thus policy for an Aspirant to initiation toanalyse himself with indefatigable energy, shrewd skill, and accurate subtlety; but then to content himself withobserving the interplay of his instincts, instead of guiding them. Not until he is familiar with them all should heperform the practices which enable him to read the Word of his Will. And, then having assumed conscious control ofhimself, that he may do his Will, he should make a point of using every faculty in a detached way (just as oneinspects one's pistols and fires a few rounds) without expecting ever to need them again, but on the general principlethat if they were wanted, one might as well feel confident of the issue."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"This theory of initiation is so important to every aspirant that I shall illustrate how my own ignorance bred error, anderror injury. My Will was, I now know, to be The Beast, 666, a Magus, the Word of the Aeon, Thelema; to proclaimthis new Law to mankind.My passion for personal freedom, my superiority to sexual impulses, my resolve to master physical fear andweakness, my contempt for other people's opinions, my poetic genius: I indulged all these to the full. None of themcarried me too far, ousted the other, or injured my general well-being. On the contrary, each automatically reachedits natural limit, and each has been incalculably useful to me in doing my Will when I became aware of it, able toorganize its armies, and to direct them intelligently against the inertia of ignorance.But I suppressed certain impulses in myself. I abandoned my ambitions to be a diplomatist. I checked my ardour forscience. I trampled upon my prudence in financial matters. I mortified my fastidiousness about caste. I masked myshyness in bravado, and tried to kill it by ostentatious eccentricity. This last mistake came from sheer panic; but allthe rest were quite deliberate sacrifices on the altar of my God Magick.They were all accepted, as it then seemed. I attained all my ambitions; yea, and more also. But I know now that Ishould not have forced my growth, and deformed my destiny. To nail geese to boards and stuff them makes foiegras, very true; but it does not improve the geese. It may be said that I strengthened my moral character by thesesacrifices, and that I was indeed compelled to act as I did. The mad elephant Wantobemagus pulled over the team ofoxen? We may put it like that, certainly; but still I feel that it might have been better had he not been mad. For,today, if I were an Ambassador, versed profoundly in Science, financially armed and socially stainless, I should beable to execute my Will by pressure upon all classes of powerful people, to make this comment carry conviction tothinkers, and to publish the Book of the Law in every part of the world. Instead, I am exiled and suspected, despisedby men of science, ostracised by my class, and a beggar. If I were in my teens again! I cannot change my mind aboutwhich ridge I'll climb the mountain by, now when I see, above these ice-glazed pinnacles storm-swept, throughgashes torn from whirling wreaths of arrowy sleet, the cloud-surpassing summit, not far, not very far.I regret nothing, be sure! I may be even in error to argue that an evident distortion of nature, and its issue in disaster,are proof of imprudence. Perhaps the other road would not have taken me to Cairo, to the climax of my life, to mytrue Will fulfilled in Aiwaz and made Word in this Book. Perhaps it is lingering \"lust of result\" that whispershideous lies to daunt me, that urges these plausible arguments to accuse me. It may be that my present extremity isthe very condition required for the fulfilment of my Work.* [Inserted footnote: * An XXI. It is now evident that thiswas the case.] Who shall say what is power, what impotence? Who shall be bold to measure the Morrow, or declarewhat causes conjoin to bring forth an Effect that no man knoweth?Was not Lao-Tze thrust forth from his city? Did not Buddha go begging in rags? Did not Mohammed flee for his lifeinto exile? Was not Bacchus the scandal and the scorn of men? Than Joseph Smith had any man less learning? Yeteach of these attained to do his Will; each cried his Word, that all the Earth yet echoes it! And each was able toaccomplish this by virtue of that very circumstance which seems so cruel. Shall I, who am armed with all theirweapons at once, complain that I must go into the fight unfurished?One must hope that his success will go beyond Joseph Smith's, who was a flagrant case of \"fool of men\". Whenreaching his first great mystical Trance — which was also his last — Smith found himself surrounded by that \"thick,oppressive darkness\" characteristic of Binah. He feared it; at once a \"ray of white light\" pierced it, and he saw\"Jesus descend from heaven unto him.\" Having thus fallen back from Samadhi into the lowest form of Dhyana, heconversed with \"Because\" under one of its innumerable shapes. \"Jesus\" being the one that had impressed his KamaRupa and his Manas most from childhood, through parental and environmental conditioning. Finally he went andpreached a \"new\" religion that had nothing of new, being, in essence, simply another form of Protestantism. As withany fool who is sufficiently firm in his own folly, a lot of other fools believed him, and Mormon ism was born. TheBook of Mormon makes most interesting study for parapsychopathologists.74. The length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. He that lives long & desires death much is everthe King among the Kings.One does not need to be constantly popping in and out of Trance.

Seealso the Essay of 'Time': Crowley: Collected Works, Vol. II. pp. 267-282.] The present remarks refer only to theconditions of 'normal' consciousness, into which we throw ourselves at recurring intervals. The doctrine here statedshould be studied in the light of previous remarks; verses 61 to 74 inclusive, form a coherent passage: notice thewords 'death' in verses 63 and 66, and 'die' in verse 68. There is evidently an intention to identify the Climax of Lovewith that of Life. It is then not unnatural for us to ask: Can 'Death' have some deeper significance than appears?Scorpio, the Zodiacal Sign of Death, is really the Sexual or Reproductive function of Nature. It is the Earth-transcending Eagle, the self-restoring Serpent, and the self-immolating Scorpion. In alchemy it is the principle ofPutrefaction, the 'Black Dragon', whose state of apparent corruption is but a prelude to the Rainbow-colouredSpring-tide of the Man in Motley. The nymph of Spring, Syrinx, the trembling hollow reed which needs but Breathto fill the world with Music, attracts Pan, the Goat-God of Ecstatic Lust, by whose Work the glory of Summer isestablished anew.It is obvious that 'the length of thy longing' varies with the number of potentialities to be satisfied. In other words,the more complex the Khu of the Star, the greater the man, and the keener his sense of his own imperfections, of thescope of his work, and of his need to achieve it.75.

Now, Leo —my rising sign— combines these ideas,as does Ra-Hoor Khuit. The Christian ideas of humility and weakness as 'virtues' are natural to slaves, cowards, anddefectives. (Not necessarily; it depends on how they are interpreted. If slaves, cowards, and defectives knew exactlywhat is meant by Christian virtues, few people would claim to be Christians, and there probably would not evenexist a Church of Rome — there would not be fools in sufficient number to finance it. See the Tao Teh King; also,LXV, v, 7; VII, iii, 53-60; v, 43- 48; vi, 33-35; vii, 1-6, 11-16, 50-52.)The type of tailless simian who finds himself a mere forked radish in a universe of giants clamouring for horsd'oeuvres must take refuge from Reality in Freudian phantasies of 'God'. He winces at the touch of Truth; and shiversat his nakedness in Nature.He therefore invents a cult of fear and shame, and makes it presumption and blasphemy to possess courage and self-respect. He burrows in the slime of 'Reverence, and godly fear' and makes himself houses of his own excrement, likethe earthworm he is. He shams dead, like other vile insects, at the approach of danger; he tries to escape notice byassuming the colour and form of his surroundings, using 'protective mimicry' like certain other invertebrates.He exudes stink or ink like the skunk or the cuttle-fish, calling the one Morality and the other Decency. He isslippery with Hypocrisy, like a slug; and, labelling the totality of his defects Perfection, defines God as Faeces sothat he may flatter himself with the epithet divine. The whole manoeuvre is described as Religion.True humility is always able to understand true Pride. The devastating description above is directed at those whocriticize the Book of the Law as lacking \"Christian\" virtues. It reminds one of the descriptions of the Pharisees in theNew Testament."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"\"Pharisees\"; however, are truly a state of mind, and not a class of society; unless one wishes to remark on theastounding regularity with which one finds Pharisees in priestly togae as soon as any Method of Theurgy ceasesbeing a Method and becomes an Established Dogma.78. Lift up thyself! for there is none like unto thee among men or among Gods! Lift up thyself, o my prophet,thy stature shall surpass the stars.

(See Liber CCCLXX.)The solution of the last sentence may depend upon the number of the verse, which is that of Mezla, the Influx fromthe Highest, and of the Book of Thoth, or Tarot.We may take 'thy name' as 'the Sun', for Qabalistic reasons; the verse need not imply the establishment of a new cultwith myself as Demigod. (Help!) But they shall worship the group of ideas connected with the Sun, and the magicalformula of the number 418, explained elsewhere.The establishment of a \"new cult\" with Aleister Crowley as Demigod would be the denial of his entire Work. Theproblem with the world is that there are too many cults already, each clamouring to be the sole Word of Truth.Thanks to His Influence, they are growing more tolerant of each other.It has never been intended, however, that they should become One Single Church. The guarantee of the Freedom ofMan's Spirit is in his right to worship where he will, as he will, and when he will, his own Concept of \"God'; whichis, after all, his groping sense of his own Godhead.79. The end of the hiding of Hadit; and blessing & worship to the prophet of the lovely Star!So mote it be!So mote it be!"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"~ The Commentaries of AL ~1. Chapter IIIBeing the core of the Equinox Vol. V no. 1by Motta1. Abrahadabra! the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.Observe firstly the word \"reward\", which is to be compared with the words \"hiding\" and \"manifestation\" in theformer chapters. To 're-ward' is to 'guard again'; this word Abrahadabra then is also to be considered as a Sentinelbefore the Fortress of the God.Why is the name of Him spelt Khut? We have seen that ST is the regular honorific termination for a God. Ra is, asshown in the Old Comment, the Sun; Hoor the Warrior Mars; who is Khu? He is the Magical Ego of a Star. Withoutthe Yod or Iota, Khu-t, we get a human conception; the insertion of that letter makes the transmutation to Godhead.When therefore Ra Hoor Khut is rewarded or re-guarded with the Magick Word of the Aeon, he becomes God. Thusin the next verse. I 'raise the spell of Ra Hoor Khuit.'The text may also be read as follows. Abrahadabra is the Magick Formula of the Aeon, by which man mayaccomplish the Great Work. This Formula is then the 'reward' given by the God, the largesse granted by Him on Hisaccession to the Lordship of the Aeon, just as the INRI-IAO-LVX formula of attainment by way of Crucifixion wasgiven by Osiris when he came to power in the last Aeon. (See Book 4 Part III, and Equinox I, vol. 3, pp. 208-233.)I must here say that I find myself in the greatest difficulty, again and again, in the comprehension of this chapter. Itmight be said roughly that at the end of the first five years of Silence (An O-IV) I understood Chapter I; at the end ofthe second five years (An X-XIV) I understood Chapter II.—2. There is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. Spelling is defunct; all is not aught. Beware!Hold! Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!'Division hither homeward'; a most dour phrase to interpret! Such curious concatenation is sure to imply profoundmeaning. Homeward must mean 'toward the House of' the Speaker. He says, then, that there is 'division', which (as Itake it) prevents man from being God. This is a natural and orthodox meaning, and it goes well with 'there' (i.e. inverse 1) 'is a word not known'. That Word is Abrahadabra, which was not known, it having been concealed by thecorrupt spelling \"abracadabra\".Nonsense. Abrahadabra has already been mentioned; it is the Word of the Aeon, and the very first word in the ThirdChapter. 'There is a word not known': there is now a word, NOT, known. Hadit is Not. 'Not' is a key-word, as wehave already seen in previous comments.Why 'division hither homeward'? Because the word 'not' makes it impossible to \"mix the planes\". The ideas of \"OneWorld\", \"One Faith\", \"One People\" are not conducive to freedom, but to its opposite. They presuppose that all men,no matter how diverse of color, geographical situation, cultural background, or idiosyncrasies, must be subservientto some general standard, or ideal, of ethics or religion or law.On the contrary, freedom depends on division, in the sense of each star keeping to its own orbit. 'All is one!\" —Ihear beginning mystics, and Qabalistic Jews, object. All is not aught. \"If ye confound the spacemarks...\" says I, 52.Ra Hoor Khuit is the God that keeps each of us in his proper place, and to Him interference with another's will isthe worst possible crime.In the past, all religions tried to conquer the world, thereby causing infinite misery to mankind; nations tried tobecome empires, increasing said misery; men tried to rule other men, instead of ruling themselves.

I am not my neighbor—meaning that, above the Abyss, I and my Neighbor are None. But if I said, \"I ammy neighbor\", as do imperfect mystics everywhere, I would be affirming not love—for love presupposes two— see I,28—30—but confusion, and my neighbour had better beware of me. In practice, people who affirm that they are youend up by wanting to use your wallet as if it were their's.This is a very important point for anybody who wishes to understand the Third Chapter.'Spelling is defunct'; this seems to be an echo of the statement in Cap. II, v. 5: \"The rituals of the old time are black.\"(The word 'defunct' is decidedly curious; the implication is 'no longer able to fulfil its function'.) 'Spelling' thenmeans 'making spells'. And this is characteristic of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, that He demands not words, but acts. (Compare'The Paris Working'.) So then we pass naturally to verse 3. 'All is not aught' is an abrogation of all previous law, onthe accession of a Monarch. He wipes out the past as with a sponge.All' is, of course, Pan, and the Initiate is Pan—see the analysis of VIAOV in Book Four, Part III, Chapter 5.Although Ra Hoor Khuit is proclaiming a New Word, He is not really changing anything. 'All is ever as it was\". Heis merely providing a clarification of existing Knowledge. His Proclamation is to the Magickal Universe asEinstein's Theory of Relativity is to Newtonian Physics. It changes nothing, but provides us with a betterunderstanding of everything, whereby we can make a more efficient use of existing Energy towards a better controlof our environment.'All is not aught': qabalistically, Not = 31;AUGHT = 1+6+3+5+9 = 24. 24 +31 = 55. It seems, then, as if 'All' is atechnical name for the Major Adept in the Thelemic Current, 55 being a number of Geburah utilizing the PositiveLight, 5 x 11. See Liber VII, iv, 29 and vii, 3.This phrase is also an excessively neat cypher or hieroglyph of the great Key to this Book. All (AL) is not aught(LA). AL is LA: that is to say, the phases of the Universe x and 0° are identical.\"Beware!\" as if it were said to a soldier, \"Attention.\"\"Hold!\" that is, \"Steady!\" \"Listen to the Proclamation!\"\"Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!\" That is, \"Here, I, the New God, utter my Word.\"3. Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them.Comment seems hardly necessary. The Great War is a mere illustration of this text. (He means the First World War.)The only nations which have suffered are those whose religion was Osirian, or, as they called it, Christian. Theexception is Turkey, which foolishly abandoned the principles of Islam to form an unholy alliance with the Giaour.Abdul Hamid would never have made such an ass of himself as the degenerate gang of \"Liberty and Progress\"; mayjackals defile the pyres of their dog fathers!Because of his early Christian upbringing, Crowley over-reacted to Christianity in his thirties and early forties. Allreligions are cursed by Ra-Hoor-Khuit, including Islam; and as time has proved, all nations in the world must sufferthe impact of the Lord of the Aeon.The God of Vengeance is in Greek ALEISTER. For some reason which I have not been able to trace, this Godbecame ALASTOR, the Desert Daemon of the Rabbins, later the \"Spirit of Solitude\" of Shelley. The attribution isappropriate enough, the root being apparently A AOMAI, I wander. The idea of \"Going\" is dreadful to thebourgeois, so that a wanderer is \"accursed\". But me judice, to settle down in life is to abandon the heroic attitude; itis to acquiesce in the stagnation of the brain. I do not want to be comfortable, or even to prolong life; I prefer tomove constantly from galaxy to galaxy, from one incarnation to another. Such is my intimate individual Will. Itseems as though this \"god of War and of Vengeance\" is then merely one who shall cause men to do their own Willsby Going as Gods do, instead of trying to check the irresistible course of Nature.P.S.

Perhaps to indicate the essence of the force.The Ritual of the Adoration of Ra-Hoor-Khuit is, one might expect, illustrative of His nature. It seems doubtfulwhether this Ritual can ever be of the type of symbolic celebration; it appears rather as if expeditions against theHeathen: i.e., Christians and other troglodytes —but most especially the parasites of man, the Jews—were to be Hisrite. And it is to be taken that 'the woman' is to take arms in His honour. This woman might be The Scarlet Woman,or perhaps Woman generally.

Amuch more enlightened attitude is to be found in His letter to a pupil reproduced as Chapter LXXIII of MagickWithout Tears.\"Ra-Hoor-Khu\": The Name of the God varies according to his Manner of Manifestation. Accordingly. Ra-Hoor-Khut is His Manifestation as Sender of the Current that radiates from Boleskine; Ra-Hoor-Khuit is HisManifestation as Lord of the Aeon; Ra-Hoor Khu is His Manifestation in the Soul, or Khu, of the worshipper. (He is,of course, an Ipsissimus; all true Gods are.) Better understanding of these variations of His Name comes onlythrough practice.\"I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough\"—A gain the old saw:All the world loves a winner. Do your True Will, and nothing else. Thelemites are NOT, repeat NOT, to preach orconvert. They are to mind their own business, which is enough to occupy the time of anyone. Argument is of theRuach, and the most it can produce is a manifestation of Because. This is the danger of all forms of theology.\"Conquer\"—it does not mean to go out warring and killing, so sorry, dear sadists. Conquer your circumstances!Conquer yourself! Then, and only then, is a man in condition to conquer others—if that be necessary forperformance of his True Will.\"Fire & blood\"—see the attributions of the Element of Fire and the Magickal attributions and qabalisticcorrespondences of blood. (One most significant is, Blood = Semen. See Commentary to verse 24.)Swords = Intellect. Spears = Magickal Will. See Book Four, Part II; Parsifal of Wagner; Liber 777.\"Let the woman be girt with a sword before me.\" This does not mean to pass women through the sword, so sorry,dear paederasts. The Sword is the symbol of the Mind— see Book Four, Part II, again. The woman of Thelema mustdevelop her intellect; she must be the equal of any man in intelligence and in reasoning power. The only thing a mancan do (on this plane) that a woman can't is to beget.Incidentally, from 1904 to now the Revolution of Woman has been in full sway. It may eventually prove to have beenmuch more important than the Industrial Revolution.\"let blood flow to my name\"—Blood = semen.\"Trample down the Heathen\" —the Heathen are all those who do not accept the Law of Thelema: Do what thou wilt.It does not mean \"people who are not of our religion\". Thelema is NOT, repeat NOT, a religion. It is a Method ofTheurgy—or of Parapsychoanalysis, if you prefer. A Jew, or a Roman Catholic, or a Buddhist, or a Marxist, is notnecessarily a \"Heathen.\" A \"Thelemite\" who wants to kill them because they don't call their idea of God Ra-Hoor-Khuit, is. See Liber Oz.\"I will give you of their flesh to eat!\"— He does. And sometimes, very tasty it is.There is also a technical meaning in the expression \"Trample down the Heathen\", for HEATHEN=5+5+1+9+5+5+50=80, one of the Holy Numbers.

Money fear not, nor laughter of thefolk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth.

First, the injunction not to fear must be taken with theutmost seriousness, since fear, in one form or another, is the main element in an ordeal. Aspirants will be put intosituations of peril, will suffer threats from gods (note \"gods\" in miniscules; true Gods never threaten you, or evenspeak to you, as a rule), from rich people, from the mob, from angels, animals, or demons. The Fates themselves willseem to turn against them. Aspirants must not heed any of this. See VII, iv, 48; Liber Tzaddi, vv. 15-17; LXV, iii, 29-33; iv, 33-41.\"Your arms\" —your Magickal Weapons, the Wand, the Cup, the Sword and the Disk. The God is then, of course, aform of Adonai: see LXV, v, 14-16, 65. He is this as Ra-Hoor-Khu. The Mass of the Phoenix—Liber 44—is t hefullest possible expression of how the Lord of the Aeon is the \"strength, force, vigour of your arms.\"In the Classification of the Elements of the Hindus, Heru-ra-ha stands for Akasha, Hadit for the Sixth and Nuit forthe Seventh.18.

In the good old days there was some sort of naturalselection; brains and stamina were necessary to survival. The race , as such, consequently improved. But we thoughtwe knew oh! so much better, and we had \"Christ's law\" and other slush. So the unfit crowded and contaminated thefit, until Earth herself grew nauseated with the mess. We had not only a war which killed some eight million men, inthe flower of their age, picked men at that, in four years, but a pestilence which killed six million in six months. (TheFirst World War and the epidemic that followed.)Are we going to repeat the insanity? Should we not rather breed humanity for quality by killing off any tainted stock,as we do with other cattle? And exterminating the vermin which infect it, especially Jews and Protestant Christians?Catholic Christians are really Pagans at heart; there is usually good stuff in them, particularly in Latin countries.They only need to be instructed in the true meaning of their faith to reject the false veils."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"An XXI: After some years spent in Catholic countries, I wish to modify the above.

He was of course closely watched by JewishIntelligence, and several traps were set to catch him in America. He resented this.Aspirants must understand that Orthodox Qabalistic Jewish Orders resented Crowley even more. The Jews,considering themselves the Chosen People, having succeeded, despite all persecutions, in imposing their tribalcodes on Western society, could not look with favour upon a Messiah who not only committed the unpardonablecrime of being Gentile, but also tried to pass himself for Irish, pooh poohed the Ten Commandments, and describedthe Bible as by \"several anonymous authors.\"However, what neither Crowley nor the Jews realized was that this verse of AL has nothing to do with pogroms,enforced sterilization, or such other modern versions of Doing-In- The -Amalekites.Mercy let be off': Let Chesed, Mercy, be under control of Tiphareth and Binah (OFF = 6+6+6= 18=3x6).\"damn them who pity\" —Pity is, as we have already explained, unnecessary; it is also misleading, harmful anddisorderly. Those who preach this diseased outlook of their fellowmen are vain, arrogant, and fundamentally selfish.The healthy man never worries about his health; the virtuous man never worries about the salvation of his soul; thetrue saint never has any doubts as to the ultimate welfare of the entire company of mankind.\"Kill\"—dying, physically or mystically, \"them who pity\"experience Hadit.\"and torture\" —see the description of the work of the Master of the Temple in his underground garden, in Liber 418.\"spare not\" —as the acid eats into the soul, only the gold will ultimately be left.

See LXV, i, 57-58; v, 61-63; VII, vii, 36-48.These quotes should give an idea of how the Lord of the Aeon goes about setting back the right pegs into the rightholes.Why must Chesed be under control of Tiphareth and Binah? Because Chesed is the Last, or First, Sephira below theAbyss; and the temptation to call itself the Alpha and the Omega is great. It not only is the First Sephira on thePillar of Mercy, it also is Mercy by name and Mercy is a quality that has been called \"good\" regardless of whether itis equilibrated by its opposite—Geburah——or not. Chesed is the origin of all disorder, because it is not directlyconnected with that Influence which should be its Governor and Ruler —Binah. Chesed is \"Above\"Tiphareth, andwill try to give itself airs, forgetting that not only is Tiphareth perfectly equilibrated by nature, being the CentralSephira of the Tree, but also receives directly the Influence of the Highest through Gimel. Only Chokhmah andBinah besides have this privilege, and they are of the Supernals. Unless the Adept leaves everything he has and is,and jumps off Chesed into the Abyss, on the slim chance of getting to Binah, and without even knowing whether hewill get there, he must resign himself to receive Her influence through Geburah and through Tiphareth, which aretechnically his \"inferiors\" in the Hierarchy.Therefore, what Ra-Hoor-Khuit is saying is, let the Adept Exempt take the Oath of the Abyss! For, as it is written,\"unbalanced force is iniquity\": Mercy untempered by Severity is but weakness that would permit abuse, and toleratethe manifestation of Evil. Again, see Liber VII, vii, 36-39.19. That stele they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well its name, & it shall be to you as 718.The reference appears to be to the old prophecies of 'Daniel' and 'John'. The first Qabalistic allusion is yet (An XIV)"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"undiscovered.An XVII. I think it proper to insert here the account of the true meaning of this verse. The circumstances are sostriking that it is well worth the while of the lay reader to become acquainted with the nature of the reasoning whichattests the praeter-human character of the Author of this Book.It follows, in the words in which it was originally written, An XVII, June 8, 1921 e.v., with no preliminaries, in myMagical Diary, at the Abbey of Thelema in Cephaloedium of Trinacria. (He means Cefalu, Sicily.)These verses are very subtly worded. How should I understand this allusion to the stele; how \"count well its name\"without knowing it?I tried to count \"Abomination of Desolation\", but that is what \"they shall call\" it, not its proper name.It seemed that this name, when found, ought to add to 718, or to be identical with some other word or phrase that didso. More, this name when found must somehow express \"the fall of Because\".For many years these two verses, despite elaborate research, yielded no meaning soever. At last I chanced on aGreek word as 718; it means \"Persistence,\" the Greek noun corresponding to \"Perdurabo\", my first magical Motto.Of course the Stele has persisted since the 26th Dynasty, but that scarcely justified naming it \"Persistence\"; also,there was nothing about \"the fall of Because.\"Now (An XVII), I was going through the Law in order to repair any details of omission in the rituals ordained, andfound these verses introduced among the instructions. They fascinated me; when I had finished the work in hand, Ireturned to them and worked for some hours with a Lexicon, starting from the word APXH, Cause, 709, to find somephrase equal to 718 which would deny Cause. I found AZA, 9, a word meaning \"dryness\", but most specially the dirtor mould upon a disused object. APXH AZA is, therefore, a precise expression of the doctrine expounded in ourLaw about \"Because\".So far, so good; but this is in no sense the name of the SteleI worked on, and found XOIZA, 718, \"Yesterday\", which might be grasped as a straw if I sank the third time; but Iwas swimming strongly enough.I found XAIPE A\\A\\, 718, \"Hail to the A\\A\\. \". I gracefully acknowledged the greeting to Our Holy Order, but wenton with my search.There is no such word as AXPICTA, \"unchristlike things\"; only blind bigotry could be satisfied with so crude an invention.Then came XAPA H, 713, an engraved character. That was a true name for the Stele; if I suffixed AD, 5, it mightread \"The Mark of Hadit\". But I did not feel inwardly that thrill of ecstasy that springs in the heart, or that dawn ofamazement that kindles the mind, when Truth's sheer simplicity takes form. There is a definite psychologicalphenomenon which accompanies any important discovery. It is like First Love, at First Sight, to the one; like therecognition of a Law of Nature, to the other. It inflames one with Love for the Universe, and it explains all itspuzzles, in a flash; and it gives an interior conviction which nothing can shake, a living certainty quite beyond one'sargued acquiescence in any newly acquired facts.I lacked this; I knew that I had to seek further. The Truth uttered by Aiwaz is hidden with such exquisite art that it isalways easy to wring out a more or less plausible meaning by torture. Yet all such learned and ingenious fumblingsreveal their own impotence; the Right Key opens the safe in a second, so simply and smoothly as to make itridiculous to doubt that the lock was made by a master smith to respond to that key and no other.The reader will have noticed that all the really important correspondences in this Book are so simple that a childmight understand them. There are also my own creaking and lumbering scholardredgers, not one of which is trulyilluminating or even convincing. The real solutions, moreover, are almost always confirmed by other parts of thetext, or by events subsequent to the Writing of the Book.I worked on: I asked myself for the thousandth time what the stele could claim with literal strictness as \"its name\". Iscribbled the word CTHAH and added it up. The result is 546, when CT counts as 500, or 52, when CT is 6, afrequent usage, as in CTAYPOS, whose number is thus 777.Idly enough, my tired pen subtracted 52 from 718. I started up like a Magician who, conjuring Satan in vain tillFaith's lamp sputters, and Hope's cloak is threadbare, gropes, heavily leaning on the staff of Love, blinking anddroning along—and suddenly sees Him!"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"I did the sum over, this time with my pen like a panther. Too good to be true! I added my figures; yes, 718 pastdenial. I checked my value of stele 52, and no error. Then only I let myself yield to the storm of delight and wonderthat rushed up from the Hand of Him that is throned in the Abyss of my Being; and I wrote in my Magical Recordthe Triumph for which I have warred for over seventeen years:718CTHAH 666No fitter name could be found, that was sure...And then came a flash to confirm me, to chase the last cloud of criticism; the actual name of the Stele, its ordinaryname, the only name it ever had until it was called the \"Stele of Revealing\", in the Book of the Law itself, \"its name\"in the Catalogue of the Museum at Boulak, was just this: \"Stele 666\".I have described this discovery at length because I wish to emphasize its importance.Most of the numbers and words openly mentioned in the Book of the Law which conceal Secret Matters werealready at that time possessed of a certain significance for me. Some unconscious cooperation of a mind might bealleged as the determinant factor in the choice of those numbers, their subsequent inter-connexions, and so onexplained by the commentators' ingenuity, and the confirmation of independent facts by coincidence.Similarly, the hidden numbers such as 3.141593,395,31,93, may be ascribed to the commentators, and denied to theintention of the text; at least, by that class of Pharisee which strains at the Butterfly of the Soul, preferring toswallow any hippopotamus if it be slimed thickly enough with the miasmal swamp-mire of materialism.But 718 is expressed openly; its nature is described sufficiently and unambiguously; and it meant nothing to anybodyin the world, either then or for seventeen years after.And now the meaning falls so pat, so natural, so self-justified, so evidently the unique value of the 'x' of theequation, that it is impossible to quibble.The law of probabilities excludes all theories but one. The simple Truth is what I have always asserted.There is a Being called Aiwaz, an intelligence discarnate, who wrote this Book of the Law, using my ears and hand.His mind is certainly superior to my own in knowledge and in power, for He has dominated me and taught me eversince.But that apart, the proof of any discarnate intelligence, even of the lowest order, has never before been established.And lack of that proof is the flaw in all the religions of the past; man could not be certain of the existence of \"God\",because though he knew many powers independent of muscle, he knew of no consciousness independent of nerve.One asks oneself, could he really be so naive as to believe this reasoning? And that this was sufficient proof of theexistence of discarnate intelligence to a truly sceptical mind? The answer is yes in both cases. It would never haveoccurred to him that a careful preparation on his part of all the keys in the MMSS, and a steady 'play-acting' for therest of his life, would be just as possible.The point of the matter is, the Book has been fulfilling itself in the life of mankind steadily, ever since the days of itsdictation. This is a much more convincing proof than any that could have been presented by the scribe. Also,personal research brings evidence of the Intelligence behind the writing, and of other Intelligences who evidently\"are of us.\"More: even had Crowley prepared all the keys himself, and 'play acted' the rest of his life, the extraordinary reachof the hidden meanings of the Book of the Law, its psychological depth, the almost unbelievable wealth of its insight,would be sufficient evidence of the exceptional quality of the Mind who wrote it. Were we to believe that it was the\"scribe and prophet\" himself the author, this would just be added justification for obeying him. For surely this wouldhave been a man much more worthy of obedience than Jesus, Buddha, or Karl Marx."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"And yet, what is the injunction given by this man to each who would obey him? \"Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law.\"Why shall that stele be called \"The Abomination of Desolation\"? This is an extremely important point, the basis ofall the revolutions in theology that have been occurring since 1904.20. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again.There is here a perception of the profound law which opposes thought to action. We act, when we act aright, uponthe instructive wisdom inherited from the ages. Our ancestors survived because they were able to adapt themselvesto their environment; their rivals failed to breed, and so \"good\" qualities are transmitted, while 'bad' are sterile. Thusthe race-thought, subconscious, tells a man that he must have a son, cost what it may. Rome was founded on the rapeof the Sabine women. Would a reasoner have advocated that rape? Was it 'justice' or 'mercy' or 'morality' or'Christianity'?There is much on the ethics of this point in Chapter II of this Book. Thomas Henry Huxley in his essay \"Ethics andEvolution\" pointed out the antithesis between these two ideas; and concluded that Evolution was bound to beatEthics in the long run. He was apparently unable to see, or unwilling to admit, that his argument proved Ethics (asunderstood by Victorians) to be false. The Ethics of Liber Legis are those of Evolution itself. We are only fools if weinterfere. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, biologically as well as in every other way.Let us take an example. I am an anti-vaccinationist in a sense which every other anti-vaccinationist would repudiate.I admit that vaccination protects from smallpox. But I should like everybody to have smallpox. The weak would die;the strong might have pitted faces; but the race would become immune to the disease in a few generations.On somewhat similar lines, I would advocate, with Samuel Butler, the destruction of all machinery. (I admit thepractical difficulties of defining the limits of legitimate devices. The issue is this: how are we to develop humanskill? The printing press is admirable in the bands of an Aldus, a Charles T. Jacobi, or even a William Morris. Butthe cheap mechanical printing of luetic rubbish on rotten pulp with worn types in inferior ink has destroyed theeyesight, putrefied the mind, and deluded the passions, of the multitude.) For machines are dodges for avoiding HardWork; and Hard Work is the salvation of the race. In The Time-Machine, H. G. Wells draws an admirable picture ofa dichotomized humanity, one branch etiolated and inane, the other brutalized and automatic. Machines have alreadynearly completed the destruction of individual craftsmanship. man is no longer a worker, but a machine-feeder. Theproduct is standardized; the result mediocrity. Nobody can obtain What He Will; he must be content with whatknavery puts on the market. Instead of every man and every woman being a star, we have an amorphous pullulationof Vermin.Although the above is very interesting, it has nothing to do with the spiritual meaning of this verse. It should be readin connection with verses 18 and 19, because it is the explanation of them.Why must \"Mercy\" \"be off'? Why shall the stele be called \"Abomination of Desolation\"? What is \"the fall ofBecause\"?We transcribe here a letter published in Newsweek, on February 26, 1968 e.v.:\"At the service held at Arlington National Cemetery, I recited in Hebrew the opening words of Psalm 22, \"Eli, Eli,Lammah azavthani\" (\"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me\"), not \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,\" which is anAramaic transliteration.\"According to (Jewish) tradition, this psalm, a cry of supreme anguish, is customarily recited when one is about tomake an appeal to a Head of State. Queen Esther recited it when she entered the court of the King to appeal to himfor mercy. Wherever God is present, there is mercy. Wherever there is no mercy, God is absent and we areforsaken.\"Abraham Joshua Heschel Jewish Theological Seminary, New York City"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Serious students should remember the description of the initiation of the Master of the Temple in Liber 418.

You do what she wants you to and she's kind to you. She t rains youto do your thinking for yourself, too, and that's good; but just you forget about her laws, and you've got trouble onyour hands—lots of trouble. A man don't make a mistake only once in the desert.\"\"Lots of people hate the desert. That's because they're really afraid of it. They're afraid of being left alone withthemselves. There's lots of people you could put down in the middle of the desert, go away and leave 'em for a week,and come back and find them completely crazy. I've seen it happen. Man sprained his ankle once, couldn't travel.The party he was with had to go right on, but they left him with lots of water and food, plenty of matches, lots ofwood. All he had to do was to just keep quiet for three or four days until he got so he could travel. He showed up incivilization just about half crazy. His ankle was all inflamed, said he'd rather have lost the whole leg than to havestayed on in that desert for another ten minutes.\"\"I think it's beautiful,\" Velma Starler said.\"Sure it's beautiful,\" Salty agreed. \"People get scared of it because out here they're alone with their Maker. Somepeople can't stand that.\"\"You know, folks, the desert is the kindest mother a man ever had, because she's so cruel. Cruelty makes you carefuland self-reliant, and that's what the desert wants. She don't want any softies hanging around. Sometimes, when she'sblistering hot and the light burns your eyes out, you see only the cruelty. But then, along this time of day, she smilesback at you and tells you her cruelty is really kindness, and you can see it from her viewpoint —and it's the rightviewpoint.\"Now we quote a passage of A. C.'s Commentary to LXV, iv, 61:\"Apart from this general signification there is a personal allusion to 666 who is Alastor, the Spirit of Solitude.Foolish Rabbins have included this symbol in their list of demons. To the well-fed Pharisee as to the modernbourgeois nothing seems more frightful than solitude in which the mind is compelled to face reality. Such peoplefear nothing so much as the wilderness. The very legend of their tribe deals with the 'land of milk and honey', thePromised Land, the wish phantasm of the sensual.\"Observe that this is merely a matter of point of view. Cap. V, vv. 59-62: What is to the smug Jew, with his Oedipuscomplex, the extreme abomination, is to us a 'land beyond honey and spice and all perfection', though we call it'Naught'. We consider them 'weary ones' and their ideal of comfort and civilisation as 'old grey land'. De gustibusnon est disputandum. But there is a criterion in this case by which we can determine whether we or they have chosenthe better part. For it is evident that no condition of existence can be really satisfactory if its joy is liable to bedisturbed. The question is whether its nature is harmonious with that of the Universe. For stability depends thereon.We should find consequently that the ideal of the bourgeois is repose, and his conception of the Cosmos static. Nowwe find that this is not the case. The Universe is a constant flux. To desire repose is thus contrary to Nature herselfWe accept this fact and define the Black Brothers directly as those who seek to check the course of events. Thebourgeois is for us therefore a clumsy ignorant amateur Black Magician. Our idea of joy is unchecked free motion,and the stability of our joy is assured by our very conception of Yesod. We find the foundation of the Universe to becontinuous change. The more we change, the more fixed we are in our joy. (Refer to the 11th and 3rd Aethyrs, andseveral similar passages in the Holy Books.) We are guaranteed by the nature of things in themselves, whereas thebourgeois is constantly being upset by such trivial matters as the efflux of time and the rate of exchange.\"The hardships of desert life, and in particular its psychological horror, indicate this correspondence emphatically.\"We quote now another passage, from A. C.'s Commentary to LXV, iv, 59.\"The epithet 'desolate' attracts the attention immediately. The word is derived from de-solare, de having an intensive"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"force, so that desolate means 'utterly alone'. The Hierophants have however been accustomed to communicatearcana in the presence of the profane by taking advantage of the similarity of sound between Sol and sol us,especially in such parts of the declension as soli, which is genitive singular of solus and dative singular of Sol, andSolis, genitive singular of sol and ablative plural of sol us. The word desolate may therefore be intended to indicatethe attribution of the Angel both to Kether (Solus) and to Tiphereth (Sol). The de may imply a reference to hisrelation with the Adept through the Path of Daleth, Love, especially in view of the fact that His Word Thelema, 93,contains the idea of Agape, 93.\"The above quotations should be sufficient for serious students to begin to understand the spiritual implications ofThelemic Initiation, and particularly the Spiritual Nature of the Lord of the Aeon, whose Word this Third Chapter ofAL is.While it is true that Initiates made use of Sol and solis as long as Latin was the courtesy-language in the West, theconcept of God in a lonely place much precedes it. The Jews, 'having the half', sensed this worship of God in high,lonely places. In the New Testament we find that \"John the Baptist\" called himself the \"Voice in the Wilderness\".\"Jesus\" is said to have wandered in the desert. It is true that in this Aeon the Hermit is not to be found in the desert.Geographically speaking. For, \"You can be lonely among men, too, \"says the snake (the snake, no less!) in St.Exupery's Little Prince.There is a practical aspect to this whole question that had better be mentioned, and it consists of the Ordeal thatmight be called 'Invoking Mercy'. Aspirants will occasionally try to blackmail Heru-ra-ha, or Aiwass, or 666, into'saving them'. Such Aspirants will deliberately get themselves into dangerous situations, into desperate straits,hoping for a last minute 'rescues by \"the Gods\". Such Aspirants usually die. When they do not die, they go insane.Let this be a warning. Heru-ra-ha shows no mercy. What He has to say to anybody in a desperate situation is this:\"Success is your proof; courage is your armour. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.\"Or, in other words: Sink or swim.Which brings us to Mr. Heschel's very simple assertion of Jewish orthodox theology: 'Wherever God is present,there is mercy. Wherever there is no mercy, God is absent and we are forsaken.\"It strikes at once any mind that has the seed of Thelemic endeavor that God can never be absent, since God isomnipresent. If God abstains from showing 'mercy', then, God must have a reason. And God being 'good', the reasonmust be a good reason. Sometimes a loving father will refuse candy to a pleading child. And the mother bird pecksher adult offspring if they try to come back into the nest.For fifteen hundred years, the Jews-the Chosen People, no less— prayed God for deliverance. For fifteen hundredyears they prayed God to let them go back to Palestine. For fifteen hundred years they prayed God for the Messiah.For fifteen hundred years the Jews were persecuted. For fifteen hundred years they were kept out of Palestine. Forfifteen hundred years every nation had a Messiah of some sort but they.Then came the Messiah of all, with a Law for all. The Chosen People at once sensed His Import, and indignantlydenied His Message. Six million of them died without mercy. Then they stopped asking God for mercy and tookmatters in their own hands. They are back in Palestine. As \"Promised Lands\" go, it is no treat. But using their headsand their hands, they are raising flowers in the desert.Still, old-line Rabbins will hardly recognise the Messiah. That is quite all right, gentlemen; we don't need you; butyou need us. And the true seers, the true poets, the true thinkers among you are waking up. Thelemites are of allcultures and of all races. Your young men and young women are beginning to sing new songs. If you don't believeme, read the end of \"Gideon\", that beautiful play by Paddy Chayefski.We come at last to the motive why the stele 666 shall be called —by the outcast and the unfit-the Abomination ofDesolation. \"Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again.\" The \"Black Brother\" makes himself a falsecrown of the horror of the Abyss, a crown which he places in Daath; but he abides in Chesed. Chesed is theCrowned King, Jupiter, the Lord of the Gods. It is to him that the profane and low initiates apply for mercy.

Because the story of Oedipus is symbolical ofHigh Initiation. In order to become a Man —the riddle of the Sphinx —the boy Oedipus must kill his father (destroythe Father Image in his own psyche) and possess his mother (destroy the Mother Image in his own psyche).

Setup my image in the East: thou shalt buy thee an image which I will show thee, especial, not unlike theone thou knowest. And it shall be suddenly easy for thee to do this.Verses 2 1-30 seem to refer to the rites of public worship of Ra Hoor-Khuit. (Nothing of the sort. The rites ofworship shall always remain private. See the Mass of the Phoenix, Liber XLIV.)The word \"Set\" is curious—is there here a reference to Set the God?With regard to the Old Comment, I did indeed find an image of the kind implied. But there seems no specialimportance in this. I am inclined to see some deeper significance in this passage. There has elsewhere been referenceto the words \"not\", \"one\", \"Thou knowest\". The word \"easy\" is moreover suggestive of some mystery; it is used inthe same doubtfully intelligible sense in verse 40.The verse can be taken literally in the strictest sense. It depends on the reader.22. The other images group around me to support me: let all be worshipped, for they shall cluster to exalt me.I am the visible object of worship; the others are secret; for the Beast & his Bride are they: and for thewinners of the Ordeal x.What is this? Thou shalt know.There are to be no regular temples of Nuit and Hadit, for They are incommensurables and absolutes. Our religiontherefore, for the People, is the Cult of the Sun, who is our particular star of the Body of Nuit, from whom, in thestrictest scientific sense, come this earth, a chilled spark of Him, and all our Light and Life. His viceregent andrepresentative in the animal kingdom is His cognate symbol the Phallus, representing Love and Liberty. Ra-Hoor-Khuit, like all true Gods, is therefore a Solar-Phallic deity. But we regard Him as He is in truth, eternal; the Solar-Phallic deities of the old Aeon, such as Osiris, \"Christ\", Hiram, Adonis, Hercules, etc., were supposed through ourignorance of the Cosmos, to 'die' and 'rise again'. Thus we celebrated rites of 'crucifixion' and so on, which have nowbecome meaningless. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the Crowned and Conquering Child. This is also a reference to the 'Crowned'and Conquering 'Child' in ourselves, our own personal God. Except ye become as little children, said 'Christ', yeshall not enter into the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom is Malkuth, the Virgin Bride, and the Child is the Dwarf-Self, the Phallic consciousness, which is the true life of Man, beyond his 'veils' of incarnation. We have to thankFreud—and especially Jung—for stating this part of the Magical Doctrine so plainly, as also for their developmentof the connexion of the Will of this 'child' with the True or Unconscious Will, and so for clarifying our doctrine ofthe 'Silent Self' or 'Holy Guardian Angel'. They are of course totally ignorant of magical phenomena, and couldhardly explain even such terms as \"Augoeides\"; and they are seriously to blame for not stating more openly that thisTrue Will is not to be daunted or suppressed; but within their limits they have done excellent work.Some technical aspects of this verse must be mentioned. First, the Ordeal x consists in the perception that 666 is theChrist, or Messiah, of this Aeon. This perception must be intuitional; it cannot be a matter of dogma or of faith.Whosoever does not have it is not qualified to officiate at Thelemic rites.As to public rites, the extant religions will remain untouched by us. Strange as it may seem, there shall be no 'holywars' or persecutions. Any cult is allowable, provided it does not try to frighten people into conversion with threatsof 'hell' or condemnation, and provided its faithful do not try to attack, punish, or pressure those of other creeds. SeeLiber OZ."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"'let all be worshipped, for they shall cluster to exalt me'. The Law is for all; the Lord of the Aeon is manifest in theimages of all faiths. Consequently, all cults of men will gravitate towards acceptance of the Rights of Man asexpressed in Liber OZ, without any need of our intervention on this plane.As for Thelemic rites, they shall never be open. The Mass of the Phoenix is individual, to be performed at home inone's personal chapel. The Canonic Mass of the O.T.O. is to be performed only in the presence of those who intendto communicate; no others are to be present.Our rites are not \"secret\", insofar as you can find them openly published, openly explained, and openly described.But they are private. Each human being has the right to worship or not to worship, as he will or as she will. We donot preach and we do not convert.

The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host ofheaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what.A: menstrual blood.B: possibly \"dragon's blood\".These two kinds of 'blood' are not to be confused. The student should be able to discover the sense of this passage byrecollecting the Qabalistic statement that \"The blood is the life\", consulting Book 4 Part III, and applying theknowledge which reposes in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the Ninth Degree of O.T.O. The 'child' is \"BABALONand THE BEAST conjoined, the Secret Saviour\", that is, the Being symbolized by the Egg and Serpent hieroglyph ofthe Phoenician adepts. The second kind is also a form of BAPHOMET, but differs from the 'child' in that it is theLion-Serpent in its original form.The process of softening and smoothing down is thus in this case that of vitalizing the Eagle. It is inadvisable toword this explanation in terms too intelligible to the profane, since uninitiated attempts to make use of theformidable arcana of Magick presented in this passage could lead only to the most fulminating and irremediabledisaster.Menstrual blood is the best blood because it is completely free of karma, being a natural elimination of theorganism.The \"sacrifice of children\", so commonly described in the traditions of many different religions, is to be interpretedalchemically.

These slay, naming your enemies; & they shall fall before you.See Liber 418, First Aethyr, final paragraphs.Serious students will understand that \"they shall fall before you\" does not necessarily mean that you shall slay them.Also, unserious students had better beware of trying to employ this magickal formula:\"thou hast no right but to do thy will.\"Perhaps the following apologue will be of help:A profane slew a beetle before Ra-Hoor-Khuit, naming a person he considered his enemy; and soon after, theprofane went mad.An Initiate slew a beetle before Ra-Hoor-Khuit, naming a person he considered his enemy; and soon after, thisperson fell before him.An Exempt Adept slew a beetle before Ra-Hoor-Khuit, naming the person he considered his worst enemy, that is,himself and soon after, he became a Master of the Temple.AUMGN.27. Also these shall breed lust & power of lust in you at the eating thereof.The word \"lust\" is not necessarily to be taken in the sense familiar to Pious Persons. It means robustness,'merriment', as of old understood. The Germans have retained the proper force of the term in \"lustig\". But even theEnglish retain \"lusty\".The Pious Person is undoubtedly a marvel. He has even succeeded in attaching a foul connotation to a colourlessword like \"certain\"— \"In a section of the city with a certain reputation women of a certain class suffering fromcertain diseases are charged with performing certain acts\" is a common enough item in the newspapers. It allows thefullest play to the dirtiest imaginations — which appears to be the aim of the Societies for the Suppression of Vice,and their like.28. Also ye shall be strong in war.'War\" is not necessarily to be interpreted in the usual sense. \"The struggle for lift\" is also a form of War -or Love.29. Moreover, be they long kept, it is better; for they swell with my force. All before me.It is not altogether clear whether the beetles or the Cakes are referred to in this strange passage. The proper way todiscover the truth of this is to experiment.If it be the beetles, there is a recipe for insects very popular in the Middle East which seems to fit the conditions.Pound the insects into a mess; dig a hole in the ground; pour the mess in; let it ferment for several days. When it isso ripe it smells, take it out and toast it dry in an oven. Then season it and fry it in olive oil and eat it."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"30. My altar is of open brass work: burn thereon in silver or gold!Silver for men, gold for women.31.

From gold forge steel!33. Be ready to fly or to smite!It suggests itself that the foregoing verses may have been already fulfilled in some manner which my feebleunderstanding of the chapter has failed hitherto to identify.One possible explanation of \"From gold forge steel\" would be, \"From the gold of Tiphereth forge the steel ofGeburah\" —or, in other words, become an Adept Major.It seems, therefore, that performance of Liber is a means to this end. See Liber VII, vii, 1-3.But in these matters speculation is useful only if it is preparatory to experiment. Only experiment counts.34. But your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: though with fire and sword it be burntdown & shattered, yet an invisible house there standeth, and shall stand until the fall of the Great Equinox;when Hrumachis shall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place.

There is no such violent antithesis as that between Osiris and Horus; Strength willprepare the Reign of Justice. We should begin already, as I deem, to regard this Justice as the Ideal whose Way weshould make ready, by virtue of our Force and Fire.This happens without our having to worry. For is not Nemo's True Name TRUTH? (M.A.A. T.). See Liber 370, v. 7.Taking the \"holy place\" to be Boleskine House, it has already been subjected to a sort of destruction. It waspresented by me to the O.T.O. and sold in order to obtain funds for the publication of The Equinox Volume III. Butthe proceeds of the sale were mostly stolen by the then Grand Treasurer General of the Order, one George MacNieCowie, who became obsessed by the vulgarest form of hate against the Germans, despite my warnings withreference to verse 59 of this Chapter. He became insane, and behaved with the blackest treachery, this theft being buta small portion of his infamies. The incident was necessary to my own initiation.Equinox III, No. 1 is full of small errors which indicate that the movement Crowley intended to start with the moneyobtained from the sale of Boleskine would have resulted in the establishment of just a branch of Old Aeon Masonrydisguised with the names of the New, and possibly of a religion to boot! Of course the Lord of the Aeon intervened.Hrumachis is the Dawning Sun; he therefore symbolizes any new course of events. The \"double-wanded one\" is\"Thmaist of dual form as Thmais and Thmait\", from whom the Greeks derived their Themis, goddess of Justice. Thestudent may refer to The Equinox Vol. I, No. 2, pages 244-261. Thmaist is the Hegemon, who bears a mitre-headedsceptre, like that of Joshua in the Royal Arch Degree of Freemasonry. He is the third officer in rank in the NeophyteRitual of the G .. D .. ,following Horus as Horus follows Osiris. He can then assume the \"throne and place\" of theRuler of the Temple when the \"Equinox of Horus\" comes to an end.The rimed section of this verse is singularly impressive and sublime.

The half of the word of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khut.Heru-ra-ha combines the ideas of Horus (cf. also 'the great angel Hru' who is set over the Book of Tahuti; see Liber"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"LXXVIII) with those of Ra and Spirit. For HA is the Atziluthic or archetypal spelling of He, the Holy Ghost. AndHa =6, the number of the Sun. He is also Nuit, H being Her letter.The language suggests that Heru-ra-ha is the 'true Name' of the Unity who is symbolized by the Twins Harpocratesand Horus. Note that the Twin Sign—and the Child Sign—is Gemini, whose letter is Zain, a sword.The doctrine of the dual character of the God is very important to a proper understanding of Him. \"The Sign of theEnterer is always to be followed immediately by the Sign of Silence\": such is the imperative injunction to theNeophyte. In Book 4 the necessity for this is explained fully.36. Then said the prophet unto the God:This passage now following appears to be a dramatic presentation of the scene shown in the Stele. The interpretationis to be that Ankh-f-n-Khonsu recorded for my benefit the details of the Magical Formula of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. To linktogether the centuries in this manner is nothing strange to the accomplished Magician; but in view of the truecharacter of Time as it appears to the Adept in Mysticism, the riddle vanishes altogether.37.

Curiously enough, The Comment, to which he paidlittle attention at the time of writing, was the only part in Class A, with AL itself It took forty years for him tounderstand its depth and sufficiency. Indeed, Hadit \"made swift and secure his pen\".A first version of the Commentary was published in The Equinox, Vol. I No. 7. It was much shorter than this, whichin its major part was written in Cefalu, Sicily, several years later.The present volume is thus the obedience to this command.Not so; what approached most \"obedience to this command\" was the edition of Book Four Part IV, The Equinox ofthe Gods, by Frater SATURNUS, 8° = 3 A\\A\\ , accompanied by a boxed facsimile of the MMSS of AL.'At them' may mean 'at their house', that is, one must give when one recognizes any one as a potential king byaccepting his hospitality. An alternative meaning is \"in their honour\".The instruction above was meant for him only.40. But the work of the comment? That is easy; and Hadit burning in thy heart shall make swift and securethy pen.I am less annoyed with myself than when I wrote the \"Old Comment\" (Published in Equinox I, 7.), but not whollycontent. How is one to write a comment? For whom? One has more than the difficulties of the lexicographer. Eachnew Postulant presents new problems; the degrees and kinds of their ignorance are no less numerous than they.

I will slay me her child: I will alienateher heart: I will cast her out from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through dusk wetstreets, and die cold and an-hungered.Although this verse is specifically directed to the Scarlet Woman, there is a sense in which it is useful to allAspirants, and it must be taken in a very literal sense.We have already remarked that there are no contradictions in this Book. You have been told not to pity; you havebeen told that compassion is the vice of kings; you must act as if you believe these assertions to be facts, if you wantto become a Thelemite.

These Trumps refer respectivelyto the \"Destruction of the World by Water\" and \"by Fire\". The meaning of these phrases is to be studied in myRituals of Magick, such as Book 4, Parts II & III. Its general purport is that He is master of both types of Force. I aminclined to opine that there is a simpler and deeper sense in the text than I have so far disclosed.As we have already remarked, these Commentaries were for the most part written between the Twenties and theThirties. \"I am the warrior Lord of the Forties\" may thus refer to the Second World War, that took place in theForties. If so, it may be that another world catastrophe, much worse, and not necessarily a war, is predicted for theEighties.\"at your arms \"is a curious turn of phrase. There may be some cryptographic implication, or there may not; at least,there is this, that the use of such un-English expressions makes a clear-cut distinction between AIWAZ and theScribe. In the inspired Books, such as Liber LXV, VII, DCCCXIII and others, written by The Beast 666 directly, notfrom dictation, no such awkward expressions are to be found. The style shews a well-marked difference.\"Battle\" may not necessarily imply physical struggle; on the contrary. Physical struggle is the last resort ofintelligent men, because it is, as a rule, inefficient. One book can be mightier than a thousand armies; one MagickRitual may set a whole nation moving."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, it is occasionally necessary to recur to physical battle to achieve one's will. In the last ditch, bruteforce understands only the argument of intelligent force.Peacemongers are similar to short-sighted merchants in that they fail to see the long-run profit for the immediateadvantages, which may not be advantages at all. The campaigns of Alexander, Genghis Khan, Attila, Omar,Napoleon, were deplorable, no doubt; but their civilizing influence was enormous. The great bursts of economic,scientific and moral progress following the two World Wars are here for anyone to see. What the Nazis did in thematter of torture during thirty years, and for which they were universally condemned, was done for a thousand yearsby the Roman Catholic Church, with general approval of the learned; and was even boasted of as an achievement bythe Jews of the Old Testament. Social conscience has progressed. We live in the most enlightened times of knownhistory; the loud cries of denunciation of social injustice are denouncing things that in our times affect onlyminorities; two hundred years ago they affected practically everybody, and were denounced by just a handful ofhonest men who were persecuted, put to death, or— if they were lucky—ignored as crackpots.47. This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; forin the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shalldivine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of itall. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. Itshall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.I am now (An XIV) a Magus 9°= 2; and I disagree with the former comment (Published in Equinox I, 7.). He needonly be a Magister Templi 8°=3 whose word is Understanding.See MMSS for allusion to the \"line drawn\" and the \"circle squared in its failure\".The attribution (in the Old Comment) of the letters to those of the Book of Enoch is unsupported.The injunction that AL be always translated along with a facsimile of the original is important, since no translation,no matter how good, can maintain all the keys, subtle double-meanings, and qabalistic puns of the original. If astudent hopes to accomplish much, he will be forced to learn the English language very thoroughly. This suggeststhat English may in future centuries achieve the distinction of a hieratic language.There are only two MMSS of AL extant in the writing of the Beast. The original MMSS was published in facsimile byFrater SATURNUS in The Equinox of the Gods. It accompanies this edition of the Commentaries. While in Cefalu,Crowley made the mistake of copying AL in his own hand, to give as a present to a favorite disciple. The favoritedisciple promptly went mad (the quartos have madder) and ran away. Years later, having apparently recovered hiswits, he sold this copy, pretending it was the true original MMSS of Liber AL. Last heard of, the buyer wasannouncing that he was the proud owner of the original MMSS of the \"bible of hell.\" Even if he were, we still don'tknow what physical possession of the MMSS of AL is supposed to prove. That you are an Ipsissimus, perhaps?...Would it were so easy!48. Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I want to go on to the holier place.49. I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.The evident interpretation of this is to take the word to be \"Do what thou wilt\", which is a secret word, because itsmeaning for every man is his own inmost secret. And it is the most profound blasphemy possible against all 'gods ofmen', because it makes every man his own God.We may then take it that this Solar-Phallic Ra Ha is Each Man Himself. As each independent cell in our bodies is tous, so is each of us to Heru-ra-ha. Each man's 'child'-consciousness is a Star in the Cosmos of the Sun, as the Sun is aStar in the Cosmos of Nuit.Serious students should consult Chapter 2 of Liber 333, and the Commentary thereof \"Q.

With my Hawk's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross.We are to consider carefully the particular attack of Heru ra ha against each of these 'gods' or prophets; for thoughthey be, or represent, the Magi of the past, the curse of their Grade must consume them. (See Liber Magi.)Thus, it is the eyes of 'Jesus' —his point of view—that must be destroyed; and this point of view is wrong because ofhis Magical Gesture of self-sacrifice.One must not for a moment suppose that this verse supports the historicity of 'Jesus'. 'Jesus is not, and never was, aman; but he was a 'god', just as a bundle of old rags and a kerosene tin on a bush may be a 'god'. There is a man-made idea, built of ignorance, fear, and meanness, for the most part, which we call 'Jesus', and which has beentricked out from time to time with various gauds from Paganism, and Judaism.The subject of 'Jesus' is, most unfortunately, too extensive for a note; it is treated fully in Liber 888The main source of the 'Jesus' of the New Testament was the unnamed Master of Righteousness' of the Essenes; butit is impossible nowadays to separate what is historical and about him from what is historical but about the prophetIonas, or the Rabbi X, or the Rabbi Y. To say nothing of the legendary and hieratic details cribbed from thehagiographies of Dionysus, Meithras, Attis, Osiris, and others.But even if it were possible to winnow t he genuine from the spurious in the ola pod rida of the Gospels—for what?Sixteen hundred years of 'Jesus' ought to be enough for any healthy stomach.Unhealthy stomachs may keep their Isa, for all we care. See AL I, 49, and the Commentary thereof52. I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him.Mohammed's point of view is wrong too; but he needs no such sharp correction as 'Jesus'. It is his face—his outwardsemblance- that is to be covered with His wings. The tenets of Islam, correctly interpreted, are not far from our Wayof Life and Light and Love and Liberty. This applies especially to the secret tenets. The external creed is merenonsense suited to the intelligence of the peoples among whom it was promulgated; but even so, Islam ismagnificent in practice. Its code is that of a man of courage and honour and self- respect; contrasting admirably withthe cringing cowardice of the damnation-dodging Christians with their unmanly and dishonest acceptance ofvicarious sacrifice, and their currish conception of themselves as 'born in sin', 'miserable sinners' with 'no health inus.53. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol and Din.\"The Indian\". The religion of Hindustan, metaphysically and mystically comprehensive enough to assure itself thepossession of much truth, is in practice almost as superstitious and false as Christianity, a faith of slaves, liars anddastards. The same remarks apply roughly to Buddhism.\"Mongol\": presumably the reference is to Confucianism, whose metaphysical and ethical flawlessness has not savedits adherents from losing those ruder virtues which are proper to a Fighting Animal, and thus yielding at last acivilization coeval with history itself to the barbarous tribes of Europe.\"Din\" — 'severity' or 'Judgment' may refer to the Jewish Law, rather than to the Faith (ad 'din') of Islam. Assumingthis, the six religions whose flesh must be torn out cover the whole globe outside Islam and Christianity."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"It should be noted that these religions are mentioned impersonally, while Christianity and Islam are mentioned inthe person of their founders, or alleged founders.Obviously, 'Din' refers to Mosaic Law; Islam has already been disposed of in the previous verse.Why assault their flesh rather than their eyes, as in the other cases? Because the metaphysics, or point of view, iscorrect—I take Judaism as Qabalistic—but the practice imperfect.Organized religion is the death of Theurgy. But at least it should not be the death of common sense. You are free tomake a fool of yourself, but leave your neighbor alone. He may make a Fool of himself—who knows?54. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.By sound, Bahlasti suggests \"hurling\" or \"blasting\"; Ompehda is not too phantastically onomatopaeic for \"anexplosion\".These two words are obviously from the Angelic Language.55. Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!The name Mary is connected with Mars, Mors, etc., from the Sanskrit MR, to slay; and with Mare, the Sea, whoseWater opposes the Fire of Horus. I here quote a passage from Liber XCVII which deals with this fully.\"Let me strictly meditate this hate of the mother. MR is the Sanskrit root \"Kill\", hence Mara, Mors, Maria, and Isuppose Meer, Mere, Mer—in short, lots of words meaning death or sea. Note Mordred as the traitor villain in Morted'Arthur. In Liber Legis we have \"Mary\" who is to be \"torn upon wheels\", apparently because she is 'inviolate'. Liber418 has some explanation of this: \"because she hath shut herself up\", I seem to remember is the phrase. It appears (Idon't remember the Sanskrit) as if a dental T or D were inserted phallically to give us Madar, Mater, Mother (?meter= measure).Does the accent in mere conceal a lost dental? I suppose Jung or Freud has this all worked out in detail.I have thought this before, long ago, but can't get a satisfactory Qabalah. 240 is a doubling of the Pentagram, ofcourse, and is a six fold of 40, the number of repressive 'sealed-up' law. By our R.O.T.A., MR is the Sea swallowingthe Sun, and the insertion of a Tau would help this in a certain formula of\"He lives in the Sun\". But that would onlyboost the Mother, which won't do, for she is the Tomb, the Eater of Flesh, and there's no getting away from it. Butapparently she is all right just so far as she is open, to enter or leave at one's pleasure, the Gateway of Eternal Life.She is Sakti, the Teh, the Magical Door between the Tao and the Manifested World. The great Obstacle then is ifthat Door be locked up. Therefore Our Lady must be symbolized as an Whore. (Note Daleth, the Door = Venus. TheDove; free flowing; all this is linked up in the symbol.) Clearly, at last, the Enemy is this Shutting up of things.Shutting the Door is preventing the Operation of Change, i.e., of Love. The objection to Calypso, Circe, Armida,Kundry, and Co. is that one is liable to be shut up in their Gardens. The whole of the Book of the Dead is a devicefor opening the closed vehicles, and enabling the Osiris to go in and out at his pleasure. On the other hand, thereseems to be a Sealing Up, for a definite period, in order to allow the Change to proceed undisturbed. Thus Earth liesfallow; the womb is closed during gestation; the Osiris is plugged with talismans. But it is vital to consider this as astrictly temporary device; and to cut out the idea of Eternal Rest. This Nibbana-idea is the Coward—'Mother'sBoy'— idea; one ought to take a refreshing dip in the Tao, no more. I think this must be brought forward as theCardinal Point of Our Holy Law. Thus, though Nuit cries \"To me!\", that is balanced by the Formula of Hadit:\"'Come unto me' is a foolish word; for it is I that go.\"Now, the Semen is God (the going-one, as shown by the Ankh or Sandal-strap, which He carries), because he goesin at the Door, stays there for a specified period, and comes out again, having flowered, and still bearing in him thatSeed of Going. (The birth of a girl is a misfortune everywhere, because the true Going-Principle is the Lion-Serpent,or Dragon; the Egg is only the Cavern where he takes refuge on occasions.)\"Perhaps the birth of a girl is a misfortune in some countries; but this is due to the 'Sin' Syndrome of the Aeon of Os"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"iris. In this Aeon, the sexes are complementary. It would be a much greater misfortune if no girls were born!Liber 418 explains this succinctly; 3rd Aethyr.\"Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON, for she hath shut herself up; and therefore is she theQueen of all those wicked devils that walk upon the earth, those that thou sawest even as little black specks thatstained the Heaven of Urania. And all these are the excrement of Choronzon.\"It is this 'shutting up' that is hideous, the image of death. It is the opposite of Going, which is God.Women under Christianity were kept virgin for the market as Strasbourg geese are nailed to boards till their liversputrefy. The nature of woman has been corrupted, her hope of a soul thwarted, her proper pleasure balked, and hermind poisoned, to titillate the jaded palates of senile bankers and ambassadors.Or senile young men of twenty-two.Why do men insist on 'innocence' in women?1. To flatter their vanity.2. To give themselves the best chance of (a) escaping venereal disease, (b) propagating their noble selves.3. To maintain power over their slaves by their possession of Knowledge.4. To keep them docile as long as possible by drawing out the debauching of their innocence. A sexually pleasedwoman is the best of willing helpers; one who is disappointed or disillusioned a very psychical eczema.5. In primitive communities, to serve as a guard against surprise and treachery.6. To cover their secret shame in the matter of sex. Hence the pretence that a woman is 'pure', modest, delicate,aesthetically beautiful and morally exalted, ethereal and unfleshly, though in fact they know her to be lascivious,shameless, coarse, ill-shapen, unscrupulous, nauseatingly bestial both physically and mentally. The advertisementsof 'dress shields', perfumes, cosmetics, anti- sweat preparations, and 'Beauty Treatments' reveal woman's nature asseen by the clear eyes of those who would lose money if they misjudged her; and they are loathesomely revolting toread. Her mental and moral characteristics are those of the parrot and the monkey. Her physiology and pathology arehideously disgusting, a sickening slime of uncleanliness.Her virgin life is a sick ape's, her sexual life a drunken sow's, her mother life all bulging filmy eyes and saggingudders. These are the facts about \"innocence\"; to this has man's Christian Endeavour dragged her when he shouldrather have made her his comrade, frank, trusty, and gay, the tenderer self of himself, his consubstantial complementeven as Earth is to the Sun.We of Thelema say that \"Every man and every woman is a star\". We do not fool and flatter women; we do notdespise and abuse them. To us a woman is Herself, absolute, original, independent, free, self justified, exactly as aman is.We dare not thwart Her Going, Goddess she! We arrogate no right upon Her will; we claim not to deflect Herdevelopment, to dispose of Her desires, or to determine Her destiny. She is Her own sole arbiter; we ask no morethan to supply our strength to Her, whose natural weakness else were prey to the world's pressure. Nay more, it weretoo zealous even to guard Her in Her Going; for She were best by Her own self-reliance to win Her own way forth!We do not want Her as a slave; we want Her free and royal, whether Her love fight death in our arms by night, orHer loyalty ride by day beside us in the Charge of the Battle of Life.\"Let the woman be girt with a sword before me!\"\"In her is all power given.\""},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"So sayeth this our Book of the Law.

And with that Word is uttered Woman's Freedom; the fools and fribbles and flirts have heard my voice.

Let Women's labour organizations support any individual who is economically harried on sexualgrounds. Let social organizations honour in public what their members practise in private.Most domestic unhappiness will disappear automatically, for its chief cause is the sexual dissatisfaction of wives, orthe anxiety (or other mental strain) engendered should they take the remedy in their own hands.The crime of abortion will lose its motive in all but the most exceptional cases.Blackmail will be confined to commercial and political offences, thus diminishing its frequency by two-thirds, atleast, maybe much more.Social scandals and jealousies will tend to disappear.Sexual disease will be easier to track and to combat, when it is no longer a disgrace to admit it.Prostitution (with its attendant crimes) will tend to disappear, as it will cease to offer exorbitant profits to those whoexploit it. The preoccupation of the minds of the public with sexual questions will no longer breed moral disease andinsanity, when the sex-appetite is treated as simply as hunger. Frankness of speech and writing on sexual questionswill dispel the ignorance which entraps so many unfortunate people; proper precautions against actual dangers willreplace unnecessary and absurd precautions against imaginary or artificial dangers; and the quacks who trade on fearwill be put out of business.All this must follow as the Light the night as soon as Woman, true to Herself, finds that She can no longer be false to"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"any man.

Love is to be divorced utterly andirrevocably from social and financial agreements, especially marriage. Love is a sport, an art, a religion, as you will;it is not an ol' do' Emporium.'Mary inviolate' is to be 'torn upon wheels' because tearing is the only treatment for her; and RV, a wheel, is thename of the feminine principle. (See Liber D.) It is her own sisters who are to punish her for the crime of denyingHer nature, not men who are to redeem her, since, as above remarked, it is man's own false sense of guilt, hisselfishness, and his cowardice, which originally forced her to blaspheme against herself, and so degraded her in herown eyes, and in his. Let him attend to his own particular business, to redeem himself—he has surely his hands full!Woman will save herself if she be but left alone to do it. I see it, I, the Beast, who have seen- who see—Spacesplendid with stars, who have seen—who see—the Body of our Lady Nuit, all-pervading, and therein swallowed up,to have found—to find—no soul that is not wholly of Her.

And Man is theVictim therein.Beneath thee, rejoicing, he lies; he exalts as he dies, burning up in the breath of thy kiss. Yea, star rushes flaming tostar; the blaze bursts, splashes the skies.There is a Cry in an unknown tongue, it resounds through the Temple of the Universe; in its one Word is Death andEcstasy, and thy title of honour, o thou, to Thyself High Priestess, Prophetess, Empress, to Thyself the Goddesswhose Name means Mother and Whore!The above Commentary was written in the Twenties, when the Female Revolution was getting started. Woman hasnow gained the same rights as man; but she did not ask for the concomitant duties.As a result we find men being conned by women, particularly in the United States of America, where marriage is, tothe male, a synonym of bond age. American wives tend to speak of a husband as in the past men spoke of a good,hard-working drudge.A free woman must respect the men she beds, otherwise why does she bed them? She must not try to dupe them, shemust give as much as she receives, and she must not assume automatically that it is a man's duty to support herchildren, if she has them. The first condition for freedom is self control and self-sufficiency. If she wants to becomepregnant, she must first make sure that the man wants to share the load of her children; and if he doesn't, she musteither carry the load herself, or postpone pregnancy until she finds another man who does.Thelemites abhore prostitution; it is sad to say, but most married women nowadays are prostitutes who stick to onecustomer, or worse, pretend to stick to one customer. Such 'chaste' women are to be utterly despised. A truly chastewoman is she who not only will defend her own sexual freedom tooth and nail, but also will punctiliously refrainfrom trying to curtail the sexual freedom of the male. See AL, I, 41.Further on the subject of Woman will be found in Liber Aleph, 168-172, 133-134, 125, 176; Magick Without Tears,15, 38; LXV, v, 8-10, 43-4 7, 50; VII, i, 48-49; iii, 7-16, 3 7-39; iv, 54-59; v, 43; vii, 15-16, 46-49; Liber 370 andLiber 156; and Liber NV.Before we pass on to the next verse, there is one obsession to which female occultists are prone which ought to bementioned: the temptation to \"be better than the male\". Just as the disciple will be tempted to \"dethrone\" the Master,some women—and generally those of most promise!—will be tempted to replace man.That is obviously utter folly.Nuit is Woman, and Hadit is Man, and They are complementary. One has no meaning without the other."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Woman can never be \"better\" than man. There are no possible grounds for comparison.Of course, it would be just as foolish to say that \"Man is better than woman.\"By function, a woman cannot rise above the Grade of Magister Templi while manifested as a woman. She does nothave the necessary anatomical instrument to function as a Magus.This is no sign of spiritual inferiority. Every man and every woman is a star. But if we deal with a Being manifestedon a plane, and operating magically on that plane, we must take on account the conditions of manifestation.In the past, women have attempted to \"say Mass\", to breed Spiritual Movements, even to rule Occult Orders. Therewere even those who tried to direct the course of a Mass of the Holy Ghost, using the man as \"instrument\"!The result has always been unmitigated disaster for all concerned. We need only compare the record of theTheosophical Society under Helena Blavatsky, who was a Magister Templi, to that under Anne Besant, who was a\"Black Brother\". Mine. Blavatsky HAD a Superior, and obeyed Him; Mrs. Besant HAD Mine. Blavatsky, but assoon, as her Superior died began disobeying all the instructions Mine. Blavatsky had given her.We know of a recent case in which the woman assumed the Magical Motto of \"Soror Chokhmah.\" This is quite allright in terms of Spiritual Aspiration, or even Spiritual Achievement; but in terms of physical manifestation, it is alaugh.The planes cannot, and must not, be mixed. We are, all of us, Male and Female in one. Our glands secrete male andfemale hormones. The difference between a male and female child is simply a matter of endocrine balance.But there IS a difference. See AL 1, 16.And it must never be forgotten.56. Also for beauty's sake and love's!It is obvious to the physiologist that beauty (that is, the fitness of proportion) and love (that is, the natural attractionbetween things whose union satisfies both) need for fulfilment absolute spontaneity and freedom from restriction. Atree grows deformed if it be crowded by other trees or by masonry; and gunpowder will not explode if its particlesare separated by much sand.If we are to have Beauty and Love, whether in begetting children or works of art, or what not, we must have perfectfreedom to act, without fear or shame or any falsity. Spontaneity, the most important factor in creation (because it isevidence of the magnetic intensity and propriety of the will to create), depends almost wholly on the absolutefreedom of the agent. Gulliver must have no bonds of packthread. These conditions have been so rare in the past,specially with regard to love, that their occurrence has usually marked something like an epoch. Practically all menwork with fear of result or lust of result, and the 'child' is a dwarf or still-born.It is within the experience of most people that pleasure-parties and the like, if organized on the spur of the moment,are always a success, while the most elaborate entertainments, prepared with all possible care, often fall flat. Nowone cannot exactly give rules for producing a 'genius' to order, a genius in this sense being one who has the Idea, andis fortified with power to enflame the enthusiasm of the crowd, with wit to know, and initiative to seize, thepsychological moment.But one can specify certain conditions, incompatible with the manifestation of this spontaneity; and the first of theseis evidently absolute freedom from obstacles, internal or external, to the idea of the 'genius'.It is clear that a woman cannot love naturally, freely, wholesomely, if she is bound to contaminate the purity of herimpulse with thoughts of her social, economical, and spiritual status. When such things restrain her, Love mayconquer, as often enough it does; but the Beauty engendered is usually stunted or wried, assuming a tragic or cynicmask. The history of the world is full of such stories; it is, one may almost say, the chief motive of Romance. I needonly mention Tristan, Paolo, Romeo, Othello, Paris, Edward the Second, Abelard, Tannhauser, of old, and recently"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Mrs. Asquith, Maud Allan, Charles Stuart Parnell, Sir Charles Dilke, Lord Henry Somerset, and Oscar Wilde. Downto 'Fatty' Arbuckle!Men and women have to face actual ruin, as well as the probability of scandal and disgust, or consent to love withinlimits which concern not love in the least. The chance of spontaneity is therefore a small one; and, should it occurand be seized, the lawyers hasten to hide under the bridal bed, while the Families, gluing eye to chink and keyhole,intrude their discordant yowls on the Duet.Then, when love dies, as it must if either party have more imagination than a lump of putty, the fetters are fixed. Heor she must go through the sordid farce of divorce if the chance of free choice is to be recovered; and even at that,the fetters leave an incurable ulcer; it is no good playing the game of respectability after one is divorced.Thus we find that almost the only love-affairs which breed no annoyance, and leave no scar, are those betweenpeople who have accepted the Law of Thelema, and broken for good with the tabus of the slave-gods. The true artist,loving his art and nothing else, can enjoy a series of spontaneous liaisons, all his life long, yet never suffer himself,or cause any other to suffer.Of such liaisons Beauty is ever the child; the wholesome attitude of the clean simple mind, free from allcomplications alien to Love, assures it.Just as a woman's body is deformed and diseased by the corset demanded by Jaganath fashion, so is her soul by thecompression of convention, which is a fashion as fitful, arbitrary, and senseless as that of the man-milliner, thoughthey call him God, and his freakish Fiat pass for Everlasting Law.The English Bible sanctions the polygamy and concubinage of Abraham, Solomon and others, the incest of Lot, thewholesale rape of captured virgins, as well as the promiscuity of the first Christians, the prostitution of templeservants, men and women, the relations of Johannes with his master, and the putting of wandering Prophets to stud,as well as the celibacy of such people as Paul. Jehovah went so far as to slay Onan because he balked at fertilizinghis brother's widow, condoned the adultery, with murder of the husband, of David, and commanded Hosea tointrigue with a \"wife of whoredom\". He only drew the moral line at any self-assertion on the part of a woman.In the past man has bludgeoned Woman into gratifying the lust of her loathed tyrant, and trampled the flower of herown love into the mire; making her rape more beastly by calling her antipathy Chastity, and proving her an uncleanthing on the evidence of the torn soiled blossom.She has had no chance to Love unless she first renounced the respect of society, and found a way to drive the wolf ofhunger from her door.Her chance is come! In any Abbey of Thelema any woman is welcome; there she is free to do her will, and held inhonour for the doing. The child of love is a star, even as all are stars; but such an one we specially cherish; it is atrophy of battle fought and won!Beauty—Babalon. Love —The Beast.The Thelemic objection to abortion is that the child's Will-to-be- Born is a True Will, not to be thwarted by anyconsideration of 'social disgrace' or 'economic hardship'. Such considerations are only possible in an immoral orinefficient society.Again, involuntary conception is possible nowadays only in societies which are immoral-the young receiving false orinsufficient instruction on sexual matters-or inefficient—people being too poor to be able to afford contraceptives, ordistribution being too restricted for such to be easily available.This is added objection to abortion.There is a further, and deeper objection: conception is impossible unless at least one of the partners wants it; and ifone of the partners wants it and the other does not, the partner who wants it is generally the woman. An abortion isthen a double crime: against the child and against the mother. The conscious mind of the mother may deny the Will"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"to Conceive; but the evidence is there, palpable (after three months, that is!).An abortion will in such cases have extremely harmful effects on the mother's psychosoma.There is, however, a certain type of woman who uses pregnancy as a trap for men. This kind of woman is worse thanany prostitute. Her blackmail technique must become permanently discouraged by society. No man should be forcedby law to support a child that he declares, on the evidence of a lie-detector, he did not want and did not know therewas a chance to engender.In such cases, the child should become a ward of the State. If the mother wishes to rear it, the mother should receivefinancial support from the State. This financial support should be for the child, not for the mother; the State shouldcheck periodically to see that it is being properly used. The mother should work to support herselfThis support should extend itself until the child's adulthood.Some \"thinkers\" may object that this might encourage women to become careless and promiscuous. By all means.We want women to become 'careless, and 'promiscuous' if that be their Will. Such women are a minority, but theyare needed, too.Another type of \"thinker\" may object t hat fatherless children would be a financial burden on the State. Thisstatement has no meaning. A child can never be a burden to any State, it can only be an asset. Any State is composedof people, and it needs new people to keep it going. To support a child with tax money is not to waste public revenue,but to invest it.57. Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, but play; all fools despise!The Book of the Law flings forth no theological fulminations; but we have quarrels enough on our hands. We haveto fight for Freedom against oppressors, religious, social, or industrial; and we are utterly opposed to compromise.Every fight is to be a fight to the finish; each one of us for himself, to do his own will; and all of us for all, toestablish the Law of Liberty.We do not want \"professional soldiers\", hired bravos sworn to have no souls of their own. They \"dare not fight\"; forhow should a man dare to fight unless his cause be a love mightier than his love of life? Therefore they \"play\"; theyhave sold themselves; their Will is no more theirs; life is no longer a serious thing to them; therefore they wanderwastrel in clubs and boudoirs and greenrooms; bridge, billiards, polo, pettie coats pullout their emptiness; scratchedfor the Great Race of Life, they watch the Derby instead.Brave such may be; they may well be (in a sense) classed with the rat; but brainless and idle they must be, who haveno goal beyond the grave, where, at the best, chance flings fast-withering flowers of false and garish glory. Theyserve to defend things vital to their country; they are the skull that keeps the brain from harm? Oh foolish brain!Wert thou not wiser to defend thyself, rather than trust to brittle bone that hinders thee from growth?Let every man bear arms, swift to resent oppression, generous and ardent to draw sword in any cause, if justice orfreedom summon him!\"All fools despise\". In this last phrase the word \"fools\" is evidently not to be taken in its deeper mystical sense, thecontext plainly bearing reference to ordinary life.But the \"fool\" is still as described in the Tarot Trump. He is an epicene creature, soft and sottish, with an imbecilelaugh and a pretty taste in fancy waistcoats. He lacks virility, like the ox which is the meaning of the letter Alephwhich describes the Trump, and his value is Zero, its number. He is air, formless and incapable of resistance, carrierof sounds which mean nothing to it, swept up into destructive rages of senseless violence from its idleness,incalculably moved by every pressure or pull. One-fifth is the fuel of fire, the corruption of rust; the rest is inert, thesoul of explosives, with a trace of that stifling and suffocating gas which is yet food for vegetable, as it is poison toanimal, life.We have here a picture of the average man, of a fool. He has no will of his own, is all things to all men, is void, a"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"repeater of words of whose sense he knows nought, a drifter, both idle and violent, compact partly of fierce passionsthat burn up both himself and the other, but mostly of inert and characterless nonentity, with a little heaviness,dullness, and stupefaction for his only positive qualities.Such are the 'fools' whom we despise. The man of Thelema is vertebrate, organized, purposeful, steady, self-controlled, virile; he uses the air as the food of his blood; so also, were he deprived of fools he could not live. Weneed our atmosphere, after all; it is only when the fools become violent madmen that we need our cloak of silence towrap us, and our staff to stay us as we ascend our mountain-ridge; and it is only if we go down into the darkness ofmines to dig us treasure of earth that we need fear to choke on their poisonous breath.58. But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers!\"The keen\": these are the men whose Will is as a sword sharp and straight, tempered and ground and polished itsflawless steel; with a Wrist and an Eye behind it.\"The proud\": these are the men who know themselves to be stars, and bend the knee to none. True pride prevents aman from doing aught unworthy of himself.\"The royal\": these are the men whose nature is kingly, the men who 'can'. They know themselves born rulers,whether their halidom be Art, or Science, or aught else soever.\"The Lofty\": these are the men who, being themselves high- hearted, endure not any baseness.59. As brothers fight ye!Fight! Fight like gentlemen, without malice, because fighting is the best game in the world, and love the second best!Don't slander your enemy, as the newspapers would have you do; just kill him, and then bury him with honour. Don'tkeep crying 'Foul' like a fifth rate pugilist. Don't boast! Don't squeal! If you're down, get up and hit him again! Fightsof that sort make fast friends.There is perhaps a magical second-meaning in this verse, a reference to the Ritual of which we find hints in thelegend of Cain and Abel, Esau and Jacob, Set and Osiris, etc. The \"Elder Brother\" within us, the Silent Self, mustslay the younger brother, the conscious self, and he must be raised again incorruptible.60. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.There are of course lesser laws than this, details, particular cases, of the Law. But the whole of the Law is Do whatthou wilt, and there is no law beyond it. This subject is treated fully in Liber Aleph, and the student should referthereto.Far better, let him assume this Law to be the Universal Key to every problem of Life, and then apply it to oneparticular case after another. As he comes by degrees to understand it, he will be astounded at the simplification ofthe most obscure questions which it furnishes. Thus he will assimilate the Law, and make it the norm of hisconscious being; this by itself will suffice to initiate him, to dissolve his complexes, to unveil himself to himself; andso shall he attain the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel.I have myself practiced constantly to prove the Law by many and divers modes in many and divers spheres ofthought, until it has become absolutely fixed in me, so much so that it appears an \"identical equation\", axiomaticindeed, and yet not a platitude, but a very sword of Truth to sunder every knot at a touch.As the practical ethics of the Law, I have formulated in words of one syllable my declaration of the RIGHTS OFMAN in Liber OZ.Liber OZ must not be regarded as individualism run wild. Its harmony with statecraft is demonstrated in the Chaptersof Liber Aleph already quoted—see comment on AL II, v. 72.Modern thought, even that of the shallowest, is compelled by AIWAZ to confirm His Law, without knowing what itis about. For instance: \"God's wind from nowhere which is called the Will; and is man's only excuse upon this"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"earth\", was written by so trivial a Fat Man as Gilbert Keith Chesterton in \"The Flying Inn.\"61. There is an end of the word of the God enthroned in Ra's seat, lightening the girders of the soul.Note that Heru-ra-ha is not merely a particular form of Ra, but the God enthroned in Ra's seat. (In Liber 418, He isexplicitly defined as the Viceroy of the Unknown King.) That is, His Kingdom on earth is temporary, as explained inverse 34. And He is here conceived as the Hierophant, \"lightening the girders of the soul\", that is, bringing man toinitiation.These \"girders\" imply the skeletal structure on which the soul is supported, the conditions of its incarnation. Man isthe heir of ages of evolutionary experience, on certain lines, so that he is organized on formulae which havedetermined the type of his development. Of some such formulae we are conscious, but not of all. Thus, it is true forall men—empirically—that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points; some savages may not knowthis consciously, but they base their actions on that knowledge.Now, we cannot doubt that consciousness has developed elsewhere than in man; only a blind meglomaniac or aChristian divine could suppose our infinitesimal mote of a planet the sole habitat of Mind, especially as our mindsare, at best, totally incompetent to comprehend Nature. It is also unlikely that our Earth's physical conditions oftemperature, atmosphere, density and so on, which some still regard as essential to Life, are found frequently; we areonly one of nine planets ourselves, and it is absurd to deny that life exists on the others, or in the Sun himself, justbecause the conditions of our own life are absent elsewhere.Such Life and Mind may therefore be utterly different to anything we know of; the 'girders' of their souls in otherspheres may be other than ours.The above argument is a case of a \"girder\"; we are bound mentally by our race-experience of the environment inwhich our own lives flourish. A pioneer choosing a camp must look for wood, water, perhaps shelter, perhaps game.In another planet he might not need any of these.The \"girders\" which determine the \"form\" of our souls are therefore limitations to our thought, as well as supports. Inthe same way, rails help a train to run easily, but confine it to a definite direction.The 'laws' of Nature and Thought, Mathematics, Logic, and so on, are 'girders' of this sort.Our race-inherited conceptions of a space prevented man, until quite recent years, from conceiving a non-Euclideangeometry, or the existence of a fourth Dimension.The initiate soon becomes aware of the untruth of many of these limiting laws of his mind; he has to identify Beingwith not-Being, to perceive Matter as continuous and homogeneous, and so for many another Truth, apprehendeddirectly by pure perception, and consequently not to be refuted by syllogistic methods. The Laws of Logic are thusdiscovered to be superficial, and their scope only partial.(It is significant in this connexion that such advanced thinkers as the Hon. Bertrand Russell have found themselvesobliged to refer mathematical laws to Logic; it seems to have escaped them that the Laws of Logic are no more thanthe statement of the limitations of their own intelligence. I quote The Book of Lies, Chapter 45.)Now then consider the man whose soul has thoroughly explored its structure, is actively conscious of its 'girders' oraxioms. He must find that they confine him like prison bars, when he would gain the freedom of the initiate.In this verse therefore doth the God \"enthroned in Ra's seat\" declare that his Word lightens (or removes) theoppression of these 'girders of the soul'.The study of this chapter is accordingly a soul preparatory course for whosoever will become Initiate.See also the six verses following this; the word increases in value as the reader advances on the Path, just as aRembrandt is a 'pretty picture' to the peasant, a 'fine work of art' to the educated man, but to the lover of Beauty asublime masterpiece, the greater as he grows himself in greatness."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"62. To Me do ye reverence! to me come ye through tribulation of ordeal, which is bliss.This seems to indicate the means to be used in freeing the soul from its 'girders'.We have seen that Ra-Hoor-Khuit is in one sense the Silent Self in a man, a Name of his Khabs, not so impersonalas Hadit, but the first and least untrue formulation of the Ego. We are to revere this self in us, then, not to suppress itand subordinate it. Nor are we to evade it, but to come to it. This is done \"through tribulation of ordeal\". Thistribulation is that experienced in the process called Psychoanalysis, now that official science has adopted—so far asits inferior intelligence permits—the methods of the Magus. But the 'ordeal' is 'bliss'; the solution of each complex by'tribulation'—note the etymological significance of the word!—is the spasm of joy which is the physiological andpsychological accompaniment of any relief from strain and congestion.Serious students will please notice \"Me\" and \"me\". One pronoun refers to the Lord of the Aeon as enthroned,radiating from Boleskine. The second pronoun refers to Ra-Hoor-Khu; that is, the Lord of the Aeon manifested inthe soul of the worshipper.Aspirants should understand that to Thelemites the verb 'to worship' means 'to identify with'. It is 'love under will'.You should not be afraid of becoming obsessed. The balance of the Universe does not permit it. Obsession alwaysbegins within, not without. Courage is your armour—and fear is the chink thereof \"Be thou therefore without fear,for in the heart of the coward virtue (Ra Hoor-Khu) abideth not.\"As to the \"tribulation of ordeal\", one word must be said about the Thelemic Current, and the early experiences ofthose who seek to identify themselves with it.First, the Current is in its beginning. It is growing, and the past currents are all dying (since the Thelemic Currentincludes the spiritual substance of all of them—this should be readily understood from the curses in AL III, 49-55).But in the present moment, the inertia of the past currents is enormous. A great effort is necessary; each newAspirant must add his energy to the Impulse. See LXV, iii, 56.Second, the Current destroys and dissolves everything in the Personality that checks the manifestation of the TrueWill of the Aspirant. Consequently, in most cases, the first impression of the Aspirant who succeeds in makingcontact with the Current is that a \"black and malignant\" force is persecuting and destroying him. And he is quiteright. See LXV, i, 12-17; ii, 7-15, 30-32, 62; iii, 30, 37-48; iv, 45-51; v, 8-9, 14,34-36,51, 61-63;see also Liber156;and Liber AL, I, 32, 60; II, 14,52-54, 60, 78-79; III, 18, 42-4 6. All this applies itself not only to \"enemies\" but toour own personality;first of all, to our own personality! See AL I, 17; Liber HAD, v. 8; Liber NV, vv. 9-11.Third, the Current does not offer \"consolation\" to the personality. It neither \"directs\" nor \"advises\" you. It merelystimulates any manifestation of the higher faculties; but in each and every case, the Aspirant must take the first step,himself by himself See LXV, iii, 3- 16, and the Commentary thereon. The \"Elephant God\" is the moral force-thestrength of character—.of the Aspirant himself If he does not manifest it -to hell with him! See AL II, 48-49.Why is the tribulation of ordeal \"bliss\"? That should need no explaining. It is hard to do something good and great;it is hard to grow up and play the man; but it is bliss, and when we look back we think: \"it was worth it\". See AL, II,9.63. The fool readeth this Book of the Law, and its comment; & he understandeth it not.The Fool is also the Great Fool, Bacchus Diphues, Harpocrates, the Dwarf-Self, the Holy Guardian Angel, and soforth. \"He understandeth it not\", that is, he understandeth that it is NOT, LA, 31.But the above is only the secondary or hieroglyphic magical meaning. The plain English still discusses the techniqueof initiation. The 'fool' is one such as described in my note on verse 57. The vain, soft, frivolous, idle, mutable sotwill make nothing either of this Book, or of my comment thereon. (The 'comment' mentioned in the verse is TheComment in Class A.) But this fool is the child Harpocrates, the \"Babe in the Egg\", the innocent not yet born, insilence waiting his hour to come forth into light. He is then the uninitiated man, and he has four ordeals to passbefore he is made perfect. These ordeals are now to be described."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"64. Let him come through the first ordeal, & it will be to him as silver.The \"Tree of Life\" in the Qabalah represents ten spheres arranged in three pillars, the central one of these containingfour, and the others three each. These spheres are attributed to certain numbers, planets, metals, and many othergroups of things; indeed all things may be referred to one or another of them. (See Book 4 Part III and Liber 777.)The four ordeals now to be described represent the ascent of the aspirant from the tenth and lowest of these spheres,which refers to the Earth, unregenerate and confused, in which the aspirant is born. He riseth in the first ordeal to thesphere called the Foundation, numbered 9, and containing, among other ideas, those of the generative organs, Air,the Moon, and Silver. Its secret Truth is that Stability is identical with Change; of this we are reminded by the factthat any multiple of 9 has 9 for the sum of its digits.The initiate will now perceive that the sum of the motions of his mind is zero, while, below their moon-like phasesand their Air-like divagations, the sex-consciousness abides untouched, the true Foundation of the Temple of hisbody, the Root of the Tree of Life that grows from Earth to Heaven. This Book is now to him \"as silver\". He sees itpure, white and shining, the mirror of his own being that this ordeal has purged of its complexes. To reach thissphere he has had to pass through a path of darkness where the Four Elements seem to him to be the Universe entire.For how should he know that they are no more than the last of the 22 segments of the Snake that is twined on theTree?Assailed by gross phantoms of matter, unreal and unintelligible, his ordeal is of terror and darkness. He may passonly by favour of his own silent God, extended and exalted within him by virtue of his conscious act in affrontingthe ordeal.65. Through the second, gold.The next sphere reached by the aspirant is named Beauty, numbered 6, and referred to the heart, to the Sun, and toGold. Here he is called an \"Adept\". The secret Truth in this place is that God is Man, symbolized by the Hexagram,in which two triangles are interlaced.In the last sphere he learnt that his Body was the Temple of the Rosy Cross, that is, that it was given him as a placewherein to perform the Magical Work of uniting the oppositions in his Nature. Here he is taught that his Heart is theCentre of Light. It is now dark, mysterious, hollow, obscure even to himself, but his Soul is to dwell there, radiatingLight on the six spheres which surround it; these represent the various powers of his mind. This Book now appearsto him as Gold; it is the perfect metal, the symbol of the Sun itself. He sees God everywhere therein.To this sphere hath the aspirant come by the Path called Temperance, shot as an arrow from a Rainbow. He hathbeheld the Light, but only in division. Nor had he won to this sphere except by Temperance, under which name wemask the art of pouring freely forth the whole of our Life, to the last spilth of our blood, yet losing never the leastdrop thereof.66. Through the third, stones of precious water.Now once again the adept aspires and comes to the sphere called the Crown, numbered 1, referred to the God Ra-Hoor-Khuit himself in man, to the Beginning of Whirling-Motions, and the First Mode of Matter. (See Liber 777, theEquinox, and Book 4 for these attributions.) Its secret Truth is that Earth is Heaven as Heaven is Earth, and showsthe aspirant to himself as being a star. All that seemed to him reality is not even to be deemed illusion, but all onelight infusing star and star. The Many, each of them, are the One; each individual, no twain alike, yet all identical;this he knows and is, for now the Word hath lightened his Soul's girders. (The logic of the Ruach—the normalintellect—is transcended in Spiritual Experience. It is, evidently, impossible to \"explain\" how this can be.)In the Number 6 he saw God interlocked with Man, two trinities made one; but here he knows that there was neverbut one.Thus now this Book is \"stones of precious water\"; its Light is not the borrowed light of gold, but is shed through theBook itself, clear- sparkling, flashed from its facets. Each phrase is a diamond; each is diverse, yet all identical. Ineach the one Light laughs!"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Now to this sphere came he by the Path called the High Priestess; She is his Silent Self, virgin beyond all veils, madefree to teach him, by virtue of this third ordeal wherein, passing through the abyss, he has stripped from him everyrag of falsehood, his last complexes, even his phantasy that he called 'I'. And so he knows at last how the soiledharlot's dress was mere disguise; naked in Moonlight shines the maiden Body!67. Through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire.Beyond the One, how shall he pass on? What is this One, which is in every place the Centre of All? Indeed thelogic-girders of our souls need lightening, if we would win to freedom of such Truth as this!Now in the \"stones of precious water\" the Light leapt clear indeed, but they were not themselves that Light. Thissphere of the One is indeed Ra-Hoor-Khuit; is not our Crowned and Conquering Child the source of Light? Nay, heis finite form of Unity, child of two married infinities; and in this last ordeal the aspirant must go beyond even hisStar, finding therein the core thereof Hadit, and losing it also in the Body of Nuit.Here is no Path that he may tread, for all is equally everywhere; nor is there any sphere to attain, for measure is nowno more.There are no words to make known the Way or the End, where the End is one with the Way; this only is said, that tohim that hath passed through this fourth ordeal this Book is as \"ultimate sparks\". No more do they reflect or transmitthe Light; they themselves are the original, the not-to-be-analysed Light, of the \"intimate fire\" of Hadit! He shall seethe Book as it is, as a shower of the Seed of the Stars!68. Yet to all it shall seem beautiful. Its enemies who say not so, are mere liars.To all; i.e., to Pan; or to AL.The sudden degradation of the style and the subject, the petulance of the point of view; what should these thingsintend?There is no petulance unless the Author Himself were lying. And He isn't.It sounds as though the scribe had protested violently in his mind against the chapter, and was especially aggrievedat the first paragraph of this verse, which, taken at its face value, promises a phenomenon impossible in literature.(As if AL were literature! What is meant by the verse is that no matter who reads the Book shall find at least onepoint of affinity with it; and this point shall seem beautiful. There are also, of course, technical meanings.) Thesecond phrase may then be a contemptuous slap at the scribe who was perhaps thinking, \"Well, it seems otherwise tome, for one!\", and the hit was a bull's eye; for I was a mere liar when I thought it. I was so enraged at havingengaged myself on such an adventure, so hated \"the hand and the pen\" which I pledged to transcribe sentiments sorepugnant to mine, such a jargon of absurdities and vulgarities as seemed to me displayed in many parts of this thirdchapter, that I would have gone to almost any length, short of deliberate breach of my thoughtless promise to mywife to see it through, to discredit the Book. I did deface my diaries with senseless additions; I did carry out myorders in such a way as to ensure failure, I did lose the Manuscript more or less purposely. I did threaten to publishthe Book 'to get rid of it'; and at this verse I was one of the \"mere liars\". For its Beauty already constrained even theworld-infected man, the nigh-disillusioned poet, the clinker-clogged lover, the recusant mystic. And, as I know now,the thought that all these things were myself was a lie. Yet the Liar was at pains to lie to itself! Why did it so? Itknew that one day this Book would shine out and dissolve it; it feared and hated this Book and, gnashing its teeth,swore falsely, and denied the Beauty that bound it.As for my true Self, silent abiding its hour, is not this Book to it the very incarnation of Beauty? What is Beauty butthe perfect expression of one's own Truth? And is not this Book the Word of Aiwaz, and is not He mine HolyGuardian Angel, the master of my Silent Self, His virgin bride on whom His love hath wrought the mystery ofIdentity?69.

This is natural, for in Him must exist the Root of the Dyad.\"my nemyss\" (better spelt \"nemmes\") is the regular head-dress of a God. It is a close cap, but with wings behind theears which end in lappets that fall in front of the shoulders. It is gathered at the nape of the neck into a cylindrical'pigtail'. I think the shape is meant to suggest the Royal Uraeus serpent.It \"shrouds the night-blue sky\" because the actual light shed by the God when he is invoked is of this colour. It mayalso mean that he conceals Nuit.The Hawk's Head symbolizes keen sight, swift action, courage and mobility.71. Hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your time is nigh at hand.This is a clear statement as to the War which was to come, and did come, in 1914 e.v.I now (An XIX) no longer agree with the above paragraph. I think \"the pillars of the world\" mean \"the Pillars ofHercules\"— about the Straits of Gibraltar. And I think the really big war will start there.P.S. An XXXIII (September 8, 1937 e.v.). Can \"twin warriors\" imply a civil war? The Spanish troubles started inSpain and Morocco.The verse may refer to a great seismic catastrophe, similar to that which destroyed Atlantis, to occur in the Eighties.72. I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; the wand of the Force of Coph Nia— but my left hand isempty, for I have crushed an Universe; & nought remains.\"The Double Wand of Power\" is a curious variant of the common \"Wand of Double Power\"; the general meaning is\"I control alike the Forces of Active and Passive\".\"Coph Nia\": the original MS has—left incomplete as not having been properly heard. The present text was filled inlater in her own hand by the first Scarlet Woman.The Egyptian Gods are usually represented as bearing an Ankh, or sandal-strap, in the left hand, the wand being inthe right. This ankh signifies the power to go, characteristic of a god.But apparently Ra Hoor Khuit had an Universe in his left hand, and crushed it so that naught remains. I think this\"Universe\" is that of monistic metaphysics; in one hand is the \"Double Wand\", in the other \"naught\". This seems torefer to the 'None and Two' ontology outlined in previous notes.73. Paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold!This might have been done, of course, in several ways. I chose that which seemed most practical. So far I havenoticed nothing remarkable.74. There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnight is ever the son.I suspect some deeper and more startling arcanum than the Old Comment (Published in the Equinox I, 7.) indicates;but I have not yet discovered it.One of the technical meanings of this verse is that Darkness is not \"evil\". There are no \"demons of the dark\". Thereis no \"absolute Evil\". (Of course, there is no \"Absolute Good\", either!) The Sun is not \"dead\" at midnight; it isshining on the other side of the world.

Because midnight was the Hour of Terror in the Middle Ages. It was thehour when ghosts came to haunt the living, devils climbed out of hell to tempt the faithful.

Also, of course, the \"ChildJesus\". See Book 4, Part III, Chapter XVI, Part II, Section V, the last paragraph.\"Ever the son\" —or, \"the son who lives eternally\".
