Its venerable author was an adept familiar with many systems of symbolism, and able to harmonise them for him-self, even as now is accomplished for all men in the Book 777. In the year 1899 he was graciously pleased to receive me as his pupil, and, living in his house, I studied daily under his guidance the Holy Qabalah. Upon his withdrawal—whether to enjoy his Earned Reward, or to perform the Work of the Brotherhood in other lands or planets matters nothing here—he bequeathed to me a beautiful Garden, the like of which hath rarely been seen upon Earth. It has been my pious duty to collate and comment upon this arcane knowledge, long treasured in my heart, watered alike by my tears and my blood, and sunned by that all-glorious Ray that multiplieth itself into an Orb ineffable. In this Garden no flower was fairer than this exquisite discourse; I beg my readers to pluck it and lay it in their hearts. It should be studied in connection with the Book 777, and with the Sepher Sephiroth, a magical dictionary of pure number which was begun by the author of this essay, carried on by myself, and now about to be published as soon as the MS. can be prepared. The reader who is at all familiar with the sublime computations of the Qabalah will find no difficulty in appreciating this Essay to the full; but all will gain benefit form the study of the ratiocinative methods employed. These methods, indeed, are so fine and subtile that they readily sublime into the Intuitive. This study is truly a Royal Magistry, an easy and sure means of exciting the consciousness from Ruach to Neschamah.

The Evolution of the Numbers is the Evolution of the Worlds, for as it is written in the Clavicula Salomonis, “The Numbers are Ideas; and the Ideas are the Powers, and the Powers are the Holy Elohim of Life.” That which is behind and beyond all Number and all thought (even as the Ain Soph with its Mighty Veils depending back from Kether is behind and beyond all Manifestation) is the number 0. Its symbol is the very Emblem of Infinite Space and Infinite Time.* Multiply it by any active and manifested number; and that number vanishes—sinks into the Ocean of Eternity. So also is the Ain Soph. From It proceed all Things: unto It all will return, when the Age of Brahman is over and done, and the day of Peace-Be-with-Us is declared by Thoth, the Great God, and the Material Universe sinketh into Infinity. The first Number, then, is ONE; emblem of the All-Father; the Unmanifest Mind behind all Manifestation: the First Mind. Multiply by It any other Number—for the Multiplication of the Numbers is a Generation, as is the Multiplication of Men and Gods—and behold! the Resultant is a replica of the Number taken. So is One the All-Father, the All-begetter—generating and producing all. The next step is the division into TWO. Thus was manifested the Great Dual Power of Nature. As above, so below. And thus we find that the simple division into two is the method of multiplication of the Amœba, the lowest, simplest, and most absolute form of physical life that we know. The Dual Power of Nature is the Great Mother of the Worlds. Again, to draw an analogy from the Material World, consider the Moon, our Mother. Behold in her the Typic representative of the Powers of the Two. Light and Darkness, Flux and Reflux, Ebb and Flow—these are her manifested Powers in Nature—where also she binds the Great Waters to her Will. Now in the Yetziratic Attribution, is the second number, Beth (i.e. a House), an Abode, the Dwelling of the Holy One, shown to be equivalent to the Sphere of Kokab and his lords. And the symbolic    * “ Hidden behind my Magic Veil of Shows, I am not seen at all—Name not my Name.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"LIBER MMCMXI 6 weapon of # is the Caduceus, whose Twin Serpents show again the Dualistic Power. (Note.—Woden, the Scandinavian Mercury, was the All-Father, as it is written in the Ritual of the Path of the Spirit of the Primal Fire c. “For all things did the Father of All Things perfect, and delivered them over unto the Second Mind; whom all Races of Men call First.”) Behold, then, in these two great numbers 1 and 2 the Father and the Mother of the Worlds and of Numbers. Now these twain being Conjoined and manifest in ONE, produce the number 3; as it is written: “For the Mind of the Father said that ‘All Things should be cut into Three,’ Whose Will* assenting All Things were so divided. For the Mind of the Father said Into three, governing All Things by Mind. And there appeared in it the Triad, Virtue and Wisdom and Multiscient Truth.” Thus floweth forth the form of the Triad.† Thus is formulated the Creative Trinity which is, as it were, the essential preliminary to Manifestation. This Mystic Son of the Eternal Parents, having for his number 3, is typified in all the sacred scripts by that number. Thus it is written of the manifestation of the Son of God upon the Earth, “Shiloh shall come” (the initial of which Mystery-Name is c = 300). And in the Grecian tongue it is written: “In the beginning was the Word,” &c., which is logoj (l = 30). But the best of all the Examples is found in the Holy Tetragram hwhy.

Now in the first of these mysterious three verses in Exodus xiv. wherein the divided name is hidden it is written, “and went the Angel of the Elohim before the Camp,” &c. And this Angel of the Elohim, \\yhla ]alm, is the Manifestations of their Presence. Now ]alm hath the number 91, which is also the number of ynda hyhw, wherefore by Gematria “Tetragrammaton our Lord” is the Angel of the Elohim of the Divided Name. Therefore is the Tetragrammaton symbolic of the Manifested Presence of the Elohim; and if the Elohim be Male and Female, so also must be the Tetragram.

And this number is herein formulated by the Concentration of the Three in One. 3 + 1 = 4. Now in this Figure II. we behold six certain Paths; and in six days did God create the Heavens and the Earth. And the total numeration of its numbers is the Perfect Number, even the Decade of the Sephiroth. (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.) Thus can our Science teach us wherefore the Door* of Venus, d, is the Gateway of Initiation: that one planet whose symbol alone embraceth the 10 Sephiroth; the Entrance to the Shrine of our Father C.R.C., the Tomb of Osiris; the God Revealer, coming, moreover, by the Central Path of s through the midst of the Triangle of Light.

And 28 is 7 x 4, the seven stars shining throughout the four Worlds. One thing is significant, indeed. Let us take the Primal Three and convert those Numbers into Colours. So we get a, the Father, the Yellow Ray of the Dawning Sun of Creation; m, the Mother, the Blue Ray of the Great Primæval Waters; c, the Son, the Red Ray: the Ruach Elohim,‡ symbol of the Red Fire of God, which brooded (v. 2) upon the Face of the Waters: or like the Red Glory that lights up the Heavens at Dawn, when the Golden Sun illumines the Waters above the Firmament. Now this Red Glory is the IGNIS DEI: which is also the AGNUS DEI, or Lamb of God that destroyeth (literally burns out) the Sins of the World. As it is written in the Ordinary of the Mass: the Priest goeth unto the South of the Altar and prays: “O Agnus Dei! qui tollis—qui tollis Peccata Mundi—Dona Nobis Pacem!” And this Fire, this Lamb of God, is Aries, Symbol of the Dawning Year: whose colour also is as the Red Fire, and which is the head of the Fiery    * As it is written in the Path of the Child of the Sons of the Mighty: “And the Chaos cried aloud for the unity of Form and the Face of the Eternal arose. . . .

So also in the Grade of Neophyte in the Order of the Golden Dawn the Hierophant weareth a robe of flame-scarlet as symbolic of the Dawn. NOTE.—It may be objected to this enunciation of the colours that y, the Father, is Fire; that h, the Mother, is Water; that w, the Son, is Air, and Yellow instead of Red. This also is true, but it relates to the governance of the Elemental Kingdoms, which are in the Astral Worlds, and whose monads are on the descending arc of Life, whilst Man is on the Ascending; that scale is therefore inverted. For by the mighty sacrifice of the Man Made Flesh and by His Torturous Pilgrimage is evolved that Glorified Son Who is Greater than His Father. In Alchemy we have again the descending arc, for we find that the red powder cast upon the Water of the Metals produceth the Golden Sol. But it is important not to confuse. The Christians have terribly muddled their Trinity by making the Son the second instead of the third Principle; whilst with them the Holy Spirit at one Time symbolizes the Mother and at another the Son. Thus at the Annunciation and at the Baptism of the Christ the S.S. appeareth as a Dove, emblem of $ and the Mother: whilst the S.S. that descended upon the Apostles at Pentecost was in reality the Spirit of the Christ, and therefore symbolised by the c (see Lecture on Microcosmos in MSS. of R.R. et A.C.). In Theosophical nomeclature this latter was the ADMUanas or Jeheshua: the third principle. For the same reason I have drawn the triangle with the 3 uppermost 1D32 instead of 3C12. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 PART II IT was necessary that I should go thus somewhat at length into this Mystery of the Opening of the Numbers, because without this explan-ation much of the meaning of the verse must necessarily remain obscure. Now let us consider this most Mystic Verse! The first thing that strikes us is that it contains Seven Words: the Second that the number of its letters is twenty-eight. Thus does it perfectly symbolise in its entirety the third Symbol in the numerical evolution. Before proceeding to a detailed analysis, and following the Process of Creation by Time (i.e., beginning at the first letter, and so proceeding), let me point out a few general facts. First as to the number of letters in each word, which converted into figures stands thus: 4.3.5.2.5.3.6. (Hebrew direction). In the midst is 2, by Taro the Central Will: and this two-lettered word is ta. On either side of this is the pair of figures 35—53, balanced one against the other: as though symbolic of the great dawning of life of the Mothers—h and #, vitalised by the SON (3) as the Vice-Gerent of His Father. These balanced figures together make 16, whereof the Key is 7; the total number of letters in the third Symbol. Then we have left at either end 4 and 6 = 10,* the perfection of the Sephiroth, as if to declare that this verse from, beginning to end thereof reflected the Voices from Kether even unto Malkuth: and 6 - 4 = 2 again, the Central Will, b, Thoth, in the Heart of the Universe (as in the centre of the verse). Note, then, this perfect equilibrium of the verse, and remember that Mystery—that equilibrium is strength. Let us now look at the letters themselves. Counting them, we find that the two central ones are am, the Supernal Mother; even as the number of letters had the dual symbol in their midst. Now their numeration is 41, yielding by Gematria lya = Force: Might: Power:    * Vide Sepher Yetzirah for this division of the Holy Sephiroth into a Hexad and a Tetrad."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LIBER MMCMXI 12 lawag, Divine Majesty: and blja = Fecundity, all symbolic of the attributes of the Dual Polar Force and Mother. Moreover, 4 + 1 = 5 = h, Mother Supernal once again—and in its geometric symbol the Pentagram—the Star of Unconquered Will. Add the next two letters on either side, and we get EtDaC\\By, or a concealed Tetragrammaton. And this also reads \\y, the Great Sea, ta, Alpha and Omega, or Essence. Add the next two, so that the six central letters are obtained; and we read hta\\yh, which signifies \\yh, swollen, extended, or expanded; and hence Thou (i.e., God, Ateh, the All) in extension. But by Metathesis of these six letters is obtained tma hyh = “Truth Was,” as if affirming solemnly the presence in the Creation of the Supernal Truth. Now let us take the first and last letters of the verse and “cast into the midst thereof the Fire of the Sun”—i.e., w (6), “the Seal of Creation” —and we have {wb, an Egg. Where we see the whole universe enclosed in the Cosmic Egg of Hindu and Egyptian Mythology: and the Formulation of the Sphere of the Universe (or Magical Mirror in Man). As it were the Egg of the Black Swan of Time, the Kala Hamsa, the Triune A M U, or word of Power or of Seb, the Bird of Life, whose will was heard in the Night of Time. The total numeric value of the verse is fntd = 4459, of which the Key is 22, the number of the Paths from a to t; and the Key of 22 is 4, the Tetractys and the Threshold of the Universe. Now to proceed to what I have termed the Time Process, the first Word of the Law then is tycarb. Now in the Hebrew Scriptures the first word of a Book is also its Title. Thus Genesis is called by the Rabbins “B’rasheth,” or “In the Beginning,” wherefore we may regard this Word as not the first word—albeit that is shadowed forth therein—but as the seal and title and Key of the whole book. Holding this in mind, let us proceed to analyse it. The number of its letters is six, the Seal of Creation, and their total numeric value is 2911. 2911 = 13 = Death, the Transformer*—the distinct formulation of the Three in One, uniting once more to produce the 4.    * As it is written: “Thy youth shall be renewed as the Eagle’s.” Now the Eagle is n. For further consideration of this 13, vide in the Portal Ritual the explanation of that terrible Key. See account of this ritual in “The Temple of Solomon the King.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A NOTE ON GENESIS 13 Now Beth primarily signifieth a House or Abode, and in Taro it is #, the Magus—the Vox Dei—and Thoth, the Recorder. Coalesce these two ideas and we get b. “This is the Magical History.” r signifieth the Head or Beginning of Time and Things; and by Taro it is glory, Life, Light, Sun. Thus read: “Of the Dawning of Life and Light.” a is by shape the Svastika, symbolically Aleph, the Ox, as though showing the fearful force of the Spiritual “Whirling Motions” upon the Material Plane, as a terrible and destructive Power. This is also shown by the Foolish Man, as the Material Tarotic emblem of that which in its proper and higher manifestation is the Spiritual Ether. Therefore we read: “Begun are the Whirling Motions.” c signifieth mighty in flame, whereof it is also the Hieroglyph. It is that Ruach Elohim brooding upon the Face of the Waters. So read: “Formulated is the Primal Fire.” y is the Hand,* symbolising Power in Action, and its Taro Key is the Hermit and the Voice of Light, the Prophet of the Gods. Thus: “Proclaimed is the Reign of the Gods of Light.” t is the last letter of the Alphabet, the finis, the Omega, the Universe, Saturn, the outermost Planet, and it is also aurt, Throa, the Gate of the Universe; and by Qabalah of nine Chambers it is d, the Gateway of Initiation. Hence “At the Threshold of the Universe.”        Also, 13 is the numeration of dja = Unity, as also is the Great Name of God, la, by Aiq Bekar or Temurah. * The Hand of God, always the Symbol of His Power."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"LIBER MMCMXI 14 So the Whole Word reads: b This is the Magical History r Of the Dawning of the Light. a Begun are the Whirling Motions; c Formulated is the Primal Fire; y Proclaimed is the Reign of the Gods of Light t At the Threshold of the Infinite Worlds! Now compare this with the Particular Exordium (G∴ D∴ MSS.

The positions of the last two letters of the Word have been relatively changed, so as to render the meaning more harmoniously. We will now proceed to the first word of the text as thus decapitated, taking B’rasheth as the Title rather than as the first Word. This latter stands Bet-Resh-Aleph, which hath three Letters, symbolising thereby the Unmanifest Trinity. Now its letters further exemplify the Trinity, for that they are the initials of three Hebrew words, which are the Names of the Persons thereof, viz:    * Remember in the description of the “Caduceus” (see “The Temple of Solomon the King”) the Air Symbol vibrating between them.

Wherefore in them lieth concealed and hidden, not alone the Divine White Brilliance of the Three Supernals (awh, cwdqw, [wrb), but even also that Gleaming Glory which partaketh of the Redness, and which cometh from the Bornless Age, which is beyond Kether. As it is written in Ancient Hindu Scripture, “In the beginning Desire, TANHA, arose in It: which was the Primal Germ of Mind.” Now in the Aryan Mythology Tanha, Desire, was the God of Love, Kâmâ; whereof the symbolic tint was Pink: as it were the first pink blush of Dawn in the Macrocosmic Sky: Herald of the Rising Sun of the Worlds, when the Great Night of Brahma was over and done. The next word in the Great Name of God the Vast One: \\yhla. Let us meditate upon its Mystery! Herein behold five Letters: In its Centre is the Great Letter h, Mother Supernal. Five once more; and its first and last letters are once again \\a, 41, the Mother, and 5, the Maternal Essence. And its numeration is 86, whereof the Key is 14, whereof the Key is 5. Wherefore we say that this great name is 5 in its form symbolic, 5 in the Heart of its Power: the Beginning and the End thereof are 5; and 5 is it in its Venerable Essence! Turn now back unto the third Symbol; gaze at it steadily for a few moments, and see hidden in the Six-fold Seal of Creation the Five-fold Star of Unconquered Will. For this was the Divine Force which created the worlds! Power Eternal, Power Resistless, Power All-dominating, in its Absolute Supremacy—gleaming as the Great Name Elohim in the Heart of the Six- fold star!

The book Sepher Sephiroth was published as a supplement to Equinox I (8). It was reprinted in a slightly abridged form in The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley (a.k.a. 777 and other Qabalistic Writings), and in full as an appendix to the third edition of Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopædia. The text and footnotes contain a number of allusions to Golden Dawn rituals; summaries of these appeared in The Temple of Solomon the King in Equinox I (2). They may also be studied in Regardie (ed.)

The actual author was probably Lévi himself. “For all things did the Father of All Things perfect &c.” (p. 6): Chaldæan Oracles, fragment 13 in the Westcott edition (14 in Kroll’s collection); known from quotations by Psellus and Pletho.. “For the Mind of the Father said that ‘All things should be cut into Three’ ... governing All Things by Mind” (p. 6): ibid., fragments 28-9 in the Westcott edition (fragment 18 in Kroll) – assembled from two separate quotations by Proclus in his Parmenides and Timæus commentaries. “And there appeared in the Triad &c.”: ibid., fragment 35 in Westcott edition (Kroll 27); source unclear."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"A NOTE ON GENESIS 19 The “Lecture on Microcosmos in MSS. of R.R. and A.C.” is probably a reference to the lecture “The Microcosm: Man,” circulated to Adepti Minores in the Second Order. Bennett may be alluding to the passage which runs: ... But the human Neshamah exists only when the higher Will is reflected by the agency of aspiration from Kether into the lower body, and when the flaming letter c is placed like a crown upon the head of Microprosopus. Thus only doth the human will become the receptacle of the higher Will and the action of Neshamah is the link therewith. The lower will is the human Jehovah, an angry and jealous God, the Shaker of the elements, the manifestor in the life of the body. But illuminated by the higher Will, he becometh hwchy, no longer angry and jealous, but the self-sacrificer and the Atoning and Reconciling One. Crowley’s remark in the footnote on p. 16 concerning the counting of final forms of letters as higher values is largely mystification: as a general rule, higher values for final forms of letters are used when to do so would give a more interesting or useful result, e.g. }ma, Amen = 741 counting } = 700 = tcma, the letters referred to the 4 elements. To reduce hwchy to 29 (footnote p. 17) requires reducing the shin to 3 but still countin the yod as 10, i.e. 10+5+3+6+5 = 29; if every letter is reduced to units we get 1+5+3+6+5 = 20. Alternatively if we just take the ordinary Gematria value of the word, we get 10+5+300+6+5 = 326 which we can then reduce as 3+2+6 = 11. “The Characters of Heaven with Thy Finger &c.” is from an English translation of the “Rosicrucian Prayer” which appeared in the second part of Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer (an eighteenth century German Rosicrucian work), as used in the Adeptus Minor ritual of the R.R. et. A.C. The Latin motto on the final emblem translates as “May the Lord our God, who gave unto us the signs, be blessed.” It is a slight adaptation of a Latin motto which appeared on the figure of the “Golden and Rosy Cross” in Geheime Figuren (which design was in turn borrowed by Mathers for the reverse of the “Complete symbol of the Rose Cross” in the R.R. et A.C.).
