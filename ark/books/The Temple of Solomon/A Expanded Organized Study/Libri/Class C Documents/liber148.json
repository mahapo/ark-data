AND ?“Expect seven misfortunes from the cripple, and forty-twofrom the one-eyed man; but when the hunchback comes, say‘Allah our aid.’ ”ARAB PROVERB.IINQUIRY. Let us inquire in the first place: What is Scepticism? The word meanslooking, questioning, investigating. One must pass by contemptuously the Christianliar’s gloss which interprets “sceptic” as “mocker”; though in a sense it is true forhim, since to inquire into Christianity is assuredly to mock at it; but I am concernedto intensify the etymological connotation in several respects. First, I do not regardmere incredulity as necessary to the idea, though credulity is incompatible with it.Incredulity implies a prejudice in favour of a negative conclusion; and the true scepticshould be perfectly unbiassed.Second, I exclude “vital scepticism.” What’s the good of anyfink? Expects (as weused to learn about “nonne?”) the answer, “Why, nuffink!” and again is prejudice.Indolence is no virtue in a questioner. Eagerness, intentness, concentration,vigilance—all these I include in the connotation of “sceptic.” Such questioning ashas been called “vital scepticism” is but a device to avoid true questioning, andtherefore its very antithesis, the devil disguised as an angel of light.[Or vice versâ, friend, if you are a Satanist; ’is a matter of words—words—words.You may write x for y in your equations, so long as you consistently write y for x.They remain unchanged—and unsolved. Is not all our “knowledge” an example ofthis fallacy of writing one unknown for another, and then crowing like Peter’s cock?]I picture the true sceptic as a man eager and alert, his deep eyes glittering like sharpswords, his hands tense with effort as he asks, “What does it matter?”I picture the false sceptic as a dude or popinjay, yawning, with dull eyes, his muscleslimp, his purpose in asking the question but the expression of his slackness andstupidity.This true sceptic is indeed the man of science; as Wells’ “Moreau” tells us. He hasdevised some means of answering his first question, and its answer is anotherquestion. It is difficult to conceive of any question, indeed, whose answer does notimply a thousand further questions. So simple an inquiry as “Why is sugar sweet?”involves an infinity of chemical researches, each leading ultimately to the blankwall—what is matter? and an infinity of physiological researches, each (similarly)leading to the blank wall—what is mind?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK2Even so, the relation between the two ideas is unthinkable; causality is itselfunthinkable; it depends, for one thing, upon experience—and what, in God’s name,is experience? Experience is impossible without memory. What is memory? Themortar of the temple of the ego, whose bricks are the impressions. And the ego? Thesum of our experience, may be. (I doubt it!) Anyhow, we have got values of y and zfor x, and values of x and z for y—all our equations are indeterminate; all ourknowledge is relative, even in a narrower sense than is usually implied by thestatement. Under the whip of the clown God, our performing donkeys thephilosophers and men of science run round and round in the ring; they have amusingtricks: they are cleverly trained; but they get nowhere.I don’t seem to be getting anywhere myself.IIA fresh attempt. Let us look into the simplest and most certain of all possiblestatements. Though exists, or if you will, Cogitatur.Descartes supposed himself to have touched bed-rock with his Cogito, ergo Sum.Huxley pointed out the complex nature of this proposition, and that it was anenthymeme with the premiss Omnes sunt, qui cogitant suppressed. He reduced it toCogito; or, to avoid the assumption of an ego, Cogitatur.Examining more closely this statement, we may still cavil at its form. We cannottranslate it into English without the use of the verb to be, so, that, after all, existenceis implied. Nor to we readily conceive that contemptuous silence is sufficient answerto the further query, “By whom is it thought?” The Buddhist may find it easy toimage an act without an agent; I am not so clever. It may be possible for a sane man;but I should like to know more about his mind before I give a final opinion.But apart from purely formal objections, we may still inquire: Is this Cogitatur true?Yes; reply the sages; for to deny it implies thought. Negatur is only a sub-section ofCogitatur.This involves, however, an axiom that the part is of the same nature as the whole; or(at the very least) an axiom that A is A.Now, I do not wish to deny that A is A, or may occasionally be A. But certainly A isA is a very different statement to our original Cogitatur.The proof of Cogitatur, in short, rests not upon itself but upon the validity of ourlogic; and if by logic we mean (as we should mean) the Code of the Laws of Thought,the irritating sceptic will have many more remarks to make: for it now appears thatthe proof that thought exists depends upon the truth of that which is thought, to sayno more."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK3We have taken Cogitatur, to try and avoid the use of esse, but A is A involves thatvery idea,1 and the proof is fatally flawed.Cogitatur depends on Est; and there’s no avoiding it.IIIShall we get on any better if we investigate this Est—Something is—Existence is—hyha rca hyha?What is Existence? The question is so fundamental that it finds no answer. Themost profound meditation only leads to an exasperating sense of impotence. Thereis, it seems, no simple rational idea in the mind which corresponds to the word.It is easy of course to drown the question in definitions, leading us to furthercomplexity—but“Existence is the gift of Divine Providence,”“Existence is the opposite of Non-Existence,”do not help us much!The plain Existence is Existence of the Hebrews goes further. It is the most scepticalof statements, in spite of its form. Existence is just existence, and there’s no more tobe said about it; don’t worry! Ah, but there is more to be said about it! Though wesearch ourselves for a thought to match the word, and fail, yet we have Berkeley’sperfectly convincing argument that (so far as we know it) existence must meanthinking existence or spiritual existence.Here then we find our Est to imply Cogitatur; and Berkeley’s arguments are“irrefragable, yet fail to produce conviction” (Hume) because the Cogitatur, as wehave shown, implies Est.Neither of these ideas is simple; each involves the other. Is the division betweenthem in our brain a proof of the total incapacity of that organ, or is there some flaw inour logic? For all depends on our logic; not upon the simple identity A is A only, butupon its whole structure from the question of simple propositions, enormouslydifficult from the moment when it occurred to the detestable genius that invented“existential import” to consider the matter, to that further complexity andcontradiction, the syllogism.   1 Crowley is failing to distinguish different senses of the verb “to be” (identity vs. existential)– T.S."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK4IVThought is appears then (in the worst case possible, denial) as the conclusion of thepremisses:There is denial of thought.(All) Denial of thought is thought.Even formally, ’tis a clumsy monster. Essentially, it seems to involve a great dealbeyond our original statement. We compass heaven and earth to make one syllogism;and when we have made it, it is tenfold more the child of mystery than ourselves.We cannot here discuss the whole problem of the validity (the surface-question of thelogical validity) of the syllogism; though one may throw out the hint that the doctrineof distributed middle seems to assume a knowledge of a Calculus of Infinites which iscertainly beyond my own poor attainments, and hardly impregnable to the simplereflection that all mathematics is conventional, and not essential; relative, and notabsolute.We go deeper and deeper, then, it seems, from the One into the Many. Our primaryproposition depends no longer upon itself, but upon the whole complex being of man,poor, disputing, muddle-headed man! Man with all his limitations and ignorance;man—man!VWe are of course no happier when we examine the Many, separately or together.They converge and diverge, each fresh hill-top of knowledge disclosing a vast landunexplored; each gain of power in our telescopes opening out new galaxies; eachimprovement in our microscopes showing us life minuter and moreincomprehensible. A mystery of the mighty spaces between molecules; a mystery ofthe ether-cushions that fend off the stars from collision! A mystery of the fulness ofthings; a mystery of the emptiness of things! Yet, as we go, there grows a sense, aninstinct, a premonition—what shall I call it?—that Being is One, and Thought isOne, and Law is One—until we ask What is that One?Then again we spin words—words—words. And we have got no single questionanswered in any ultimate sense.What is the moon made of?Science replies “Green Cheese.”For our one moon we now have two ideas."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK5Greenness, and Cheese.Greenness depends on the sunlight, and the eye, and a thousand other things.Cheese depends on bacteria and fermentation and the nature of the cow.“Deeper, ever deeper, into the mire of things!”Shall we cut the Gordian knot? shall we say “There is God”?What, in the devil’s name, is God?If (with Moses) we picture Him as an old man showing us His back parts, who shallblame us? The great Question—any question is the great question—does indeed treatus thus cavalierly, the disenchanted Sceptic is too prone to think!Well, shall we define Him as a loving Father, as a jealous priest, as a gleam of lightupon the holy Ark? What does is matter? All these images are of wood and stone,the wood and stone of our own stupid brains! The Fatherhood of God is but a humantype; the idea of a human father conjoined with the idea of immensity. Two for Oneagain!No combination of thoughts can be greater than the thinking brain itself; all we canthink of God or say of Him, so long as our words represent thoughts, is less than thewhole brain which thinks, and orders speech.Very good: shall we proceed by denying Him all thinkable qualities, as do theheathen? All we obtain is mere negation of thought.Either He is unknowable, or He is less than we are. Then, too, that which isunknowable is unknown; and “God” or “There is God” as an answer to our questionbecomes as meaningless as any other.Who are we, then?We are Spencerian Agnostics, poor silly, damned Spencerian Agnostics!And there is an end of the matter.VIIt is surely time that we began to question the validity of some of our data. So far ourscepticism has not only knocked to pieces our tower of thought, but rooted up thefoundation-stone and ground it into finer and more poisonous powder than that intowhich Moses ground the calf. These golden Elohim! Our calf-heads that brought usnot out of Egypt, but into a darkness deeper and more tangible than any darkness ofthe double Empire of Asar."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK6Hume put his little ? to Berkeley’s God-! ; Buddha his ? to the Vedic Atman-!—andneither Hume nor Buddha was baulked of his reward. Ourselves may put ? to ourown ? since we have found no ! to put it to; and wouldn’t it be jolly if our own second? suddenly straightened its back and threw its chest out and marched off as ! ?Suppose then we accept our scepticism as having destroyed our knowledge root andbranch—is there no limit to its action? Does it not in a sense stultify itself? Havingdestroyed logic by logic—if Satan cast out Satan, how shall his kingdom stand?Let us stand on the Mount, Saviours of the World that we are, and answer “Get theebehind me, Satan!” though refraining from quoting texts or giving reasons.Oho! says somebody; is Aleister Crowley here?—Samson blinded and bound,grinding corn for the Philistines?Not at all, dear boy!We shall put all the questions that we can put—but we may find a tower built upon arock, against which the winds beat in vain.Not what Christians call faith, be sure! But what (possibly) the forgers of theEpistles—those eminent mystics!—meant by faith. What I call Samadhi!—and as“faith without works is dead,” so, good friends, Samadhi is all humbug unless thepractitioner shows the glint of its gold in his work in the world. If your mysticbecomes Dante, well; if Tennyson, a fig for his trances!But how does this tower of Samadhi stand the assault of Question-time?Is not the idea of Samadhi just as dependent on all the other ideas—man, time, being,thought, logic? If I seek to explain Samadhi by analogy, am I not often found talkingas if we knew all about Evolution, and Mathematics, and History? Complex andunscientific studies, mere straws before the blast of our hunchback friend!Well, one of the buttresses is just the small matter of common sense.The other day I was with Dorothy, and, as I foolishly imagined, very cosy; for hersandwiches are celebrated. It was surely bad taste on the part of Father BernardVaughan, and Dr. Torrey, and Ananda Metteyya, and Mr G.W. Foote, and CaptainFuller, and the ghost of Immanuel Kant, and Mr. Bernard Shaw, and young Neuburg,to intrude. But intrude they did; and talk! I never heard anything like it. Every onewith his own point of view; but all agreed that Dorothy was non-existent, or ifexistent, a most awful specimen, that her buns were stale, and her tea stewed; ergo,that I was having a very poor time of it. Talk! Good God! But Dorothy kept onquietly and took no notice; and in the end I forgot about them."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK7Thinking it over soberly, I see now that very likely they were quite right: I can’tprove it either way. But as a mere practical man, I intend taking the steamer—formy sins I am in Gibraltar—back to Dorothy at the earliest possible moment.Sandwiches of bun and German sausage may be vulgar even imaginary—it’s the tasteI like. And the more I munch, the more complacent I feel, until I go so far as to offermy critics a bite.This sounds in a way like the “Interior Certainty” of the common or gardenChristian; but there are differences.The Christian insists on notorious lies being accepted as an essential part of his(more usually her) system; I, on the contrary, ask for facts, for observation. UnderScepticism, true, one is just as much a house of cards as the other; but only in thephilosophical sense.Practically, Science is true; and Faith is foolish.Practically, 3 × 1 is the truth; and 3 × 1 = 3 is a lie; though, sceptically, bothstatements may be false or unintelligible.Practically, Franklin’s method of obtaining fire from heaven is better than that ofPrometheus or Elijah. I am now writing by the light that Franklin’s discoveryenabled men to use.Practically, “I concentrated my mind upon a white radiant triangle in whose centrewas a shining eye, for 22 minutes and 10 seconds, my attention wandering 45 times”is a scientific and valuable statement. “I prayed fervently to the Lord for the space ofmany days” means anything or nothing. Anybody who cares to do so may imitate myexperiment and compare his result with mine. In the latter case one would always bewondering what “fervently meant” and who “the Lord” was, and how many daysmade “many.”My claim, too, is more modest than the Christian’s. He (usually she) knows moreabout my future than is altogether pleasant; I claim nothing absolute from mySamadhi—I know only too well the worthlessness of single-handed observations,even on so simple a matter as a boiling-point determination!—and as for his (usuallyher) future, I content myself with mere common sense about the probable end of afool.So that after all I keep my scepticism intact—and I keep my Samadhi intact. The onebalances the other; I care nothing for the vulgar brawling of these two varlets of mymind!"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK8VIIIf, however, you would really like to know what might be said on the soldierly side ofthe question, I shall endeavour to oblige.It is necessary if a question is to put intelligibly that the querent should be on thesame plane as the quesited.Answer is impossible if you ask: Are round squares triangular? or Is butter virtuous? orHow may ounces go to the shilling? for the “questions” are not really questions at all.So if you ask me Is Samadhi real? I reply: First, I pray you, establish a connectionbetween the terms. What do you mean by Samadhi?There is a physiological (or pathological; never mind now!) state which I call Samadhi;and that state is as real—in relation to man—as sleep, or intoxication, or death.Philosophically, we may doubt the existence of all of these; but we have no groundsfor discriminating between them—the Academic Scepticism is a wholesale firm, Ihope!—and practically, I challenge you to draw valid distinctions.All these are states of the consciousness of man; and if you seek to destroy one, allfall together.VIIII must, at the risk of appearing to digress, insist upon this distinction betweenphilosophical and practical points of view, or (in Qabalistic language) betweenKether and Malkuth.In private conversation I find it hard—almost impossible—to get people tounderstand what seems to me so very simple a point. I shall try to make itexceptionally clear.A boot is an illusion.A hat is an illusion.Therefore, a boot is a hat.So argue my friends, not distributing the middle term.But thus argue I.All boots are illusions.All hats are illusions.Therefore (though it is not a syllogism), all boots and hats are illusions.I add:To the man in Kether no illusions matter.Therefore: to the man in Kether neither boots nor hats matter."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK9In fact, the man in Kether is out of all relation to these boots and hats.You, they say, claim to be a man in Kether (I don’t). Why then, do you not wearboots on your head and hats on your feet?I can only answer that I the man in Kether(’tis but an argument) am out of allrelation as much with feet and heads as with boots and hats. But why should I (frommy exalted pinnacle) stoop down and worry the headed and footed gentleman inMalkuth, who after all doesn’t exist for me, by these drastic alterations in his toilet?There is no distinction whatever; I might easily put the boots on his shoulders, withhis head on one foot and his hat on the other.In short, why not be a clean-living Irish gentleman, even if you do have insane ideasabout the universe?Very good, say my friends, unabashed, then why not stick to that? Why glorifySpanish gipsies when you have married a clergyman’s daughter?Why go about proclaiming that you can get as good fun for eighteenpence as usuallycosts men a career?Ah! let me introduce you to the man in Tiphereth; that is, the man who is trying toraise his consciousness from Malkuth to Kether.This Tiphereth man is in a devil of a hole! He knows theoretically all about theKether point of view (or thinks he does) and practically all about the Malkuth pointof view. Consequently he goes about contradicting Malkuth; he refuses to allowMalkuth to obsess his thought. He keeps on crying out that there is no differencebetween a goat and a God, in the hope of hypnotising himself (as it were) into thatperception of their identity, which is his (partial and incorrect) idea of how thingslook from Kether.This man performs great magic; very strong medicine. He really does find gold onthe midden and skeletons in pretty girls.In Abiegnus the Sacred Mountain of the Rosicrucians the Postulant finds but a coffinin the central shrine; yet that coffin contains Christian Rosencreutz who is dead andis alive for evermore and hath the keys of Hell and of Death.Ay! your Tiphereth man, child of Mercy and Justice, looks deeper than the skin!But he seems a ridiculous object enough both to the Malkuth man and to the Ketherman.Still, he’s the most interesting man there is; and we all must pass through that stagebefore we get our heads really clear, the Kether-vision above the Clouds that encirclethe mountain Abiegnus."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK10IXRunning and returning, like the Cherubim, we may now resume our attempt to drillour hunchback friend into a presentable soldier. The digression will not have beenall digression, either; for it will have thrown a deal of light on the question of thelimitations of scepticism.We have questioned the Malkuth point of view; it appears absurd, be it agreed. Butthe Tiphereth position is unshaken; Tiphereth needs no telling that Malkuth isabsurd. When we turn our artillery against Tiphereth, that too crumbles; but Ketherfrowns above us.Attack Kether, and it falls: but the Yetziratic Malkuth is still there . . . . until wereach Kether of Atziluth and the Infinite Light, and Space, and Nothing.So then we retire up the path, fighting rear-guard actions; at every moment a soldieris slain by a hunchback; but as we retire there is always a soldier just by us.Until the end. The end? Buddha thought the supply of hunchbacks infinite; but whyshould not the soldiers themselves be infinite in number?However that may be, here is the point; it takes a moment for a hunchback to kill hisman, and the further we get from our base the longer it takes. You may crumble toashes the dream-world of a boy, as it were, between your fingers; but before you canbring the physical universe tumbling about a man’s ears he requires to drill hishunchbacks so devilish well that they are terribly like soldiers themselves. And aquestion capable of shaking the consciousness of Samadhi could, I imagine, give longodds to one of Frederick’s grenadiers.It is useless to attack the mystic by asking him if he is quite sure Samadhi is good forhis poor health; ’tis like asking the huntsman to be very careful, please, not to hurtthe fox.The ultimate Question, the one that really knocks Samadhi to pieces, is such a stupendousIdea that it is far more of a ! than all previous !’s together, for all its ? form.And the name of that Question is Nibbana.Take this matter of the soul.When Mr. Judas McCabbage2 asks the Man in the Street why he believes in a soul,the Man stammers out that he has always heard so; naturally McCabbage has nodifficulty in proving to him by biological methods that he has no soul; and with asunny smile each passes on his way.But McCabbage is wasted on the philosopher whose belief in a soul rests onintrospection; we must have heavier metal; Hume will serve our turn, may be.   2 Joseph McCabe, a “rationalist” / atheist writer of the period – T.S."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK11But Hume in his turn becomes perfectly futile, pitted against the Hindu mystic, whois in constant enjoyment of his new-found Atman. It takes a Buddha-gun to knockhis castle down.Now the ideas of McCabbage are banal and dull; those of Hume are live and virile;there is a joy in them greater than the joy of the Man in the Street. So too theBuddha-thought, Anatta, is a more splendid conception than the philosopher’sDutch-doll-like Ego, or the rational artillery of Hume.This weapon, too, that has destroyed our lesser, our illusionary universes, everrevealing one more real, shall we not wield it with divine ecstasy? Shall we not, too,perceive the inter-dependence of the Questions and the Answers, the necessaryconnection of the one with the other, so that (just as 0 × ∞ is an indefinite) we destroythe absolutism of either ? or ! by their alteration and balance, until in our series? ! ? ! ? ! ? . . . ! ? ! ? . . . we care nothing as to which may prove the final term, anysingle term being so negligible a quantity in relation to the vastness of the series? Isit not a series of geometrical progression, with a factor positive and incalculably vast?In the light of the whole process, then, we perceive that there is no absolute value inthe swing of the pendulum, though its shaft lengthen, its rate grow slower, and itssweep wider at every swing.What should interest us is the consideration of the Point from which it hangs,motionless at the height of things! We are unfavourably placed to observe this,desperately clinging as we are to the bob of the pendulum, sick with our senselessswinging to and fro in the abyss!We must climb up the shaft to reach that point—but—wait one moment! Howobscure and subtle has our simile become! Can we attach any true meaning to thephrase? I doubt it, seeing what we have taken for the limits of the swing. True, itmay be that the end of the swing is always 360° so that the !-point and the ?-pointcoincide; but that is not the same thing as having no swing at all, unless we makekinematics identical with statics.What is to be done? How shall such mysteries be uttered?Is this how it is that the true Path of the Wise is said to lie in a totally different plane fromall his advance in the path of Knowledge, and of Trance? We have already been obliged totake the Fourth Dimension to illustrate (if not explain) the nature of Samadhi.Ah, say the adepts, Samadhi is not the end, but the beginning. You must regard Samadhias the normal state of mind which enables you to begin your researches, just as waking isthe state from which you rise to Samadhi, sleep the state from which you rose to waking.And only from Sammasamadhi—continuous trance of the right kind—can you rise up asit were on tiptoe and peer through the clouds unto the mountains."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK12Now of course it is really awfully decent of the adepts to take all that trouble over us,and to put it so nicely and clearly. All we have to do, you see, is to acquire Samma-samadhi, and then rise on tiptoe. Just so!But then there are the other adepts. Hark at him! Little brother, he says, let us ratherconsider that as the pendulum swings more and more slowly every time, it mustultimately stop, as soon as the shaft is of infinite length. Good! then it isn’t apendulum at all but a Mahalingam—The Mahalingam of Shiva (Namo Shivayanamaha Aum!) which is all I ever thought it was; all you have to do is to keepswinging hard—I know it’s hook-swinging!—and you get there in the End. Whybother to swing? First, because you’re bound to swing, whether you like it or not;second, because your attention is thereby distracted from those lumbar muscles inwhich the hook is so very firmly fixed; third, because after all it’s a ripping goodgame; fourth, because you want to get on, and even to seem to progress is better thanstanding still. A treadmill is admittedly good exercise.True, the question, “Why become an Arahat?” should precede, “How become anArahat?” but an unbiassed man will easily cancel the first question with “Whynot?”—the How is not so easy to get rid of. Then, from the standpoint of the Arahathimself, perhaps this “Why did I become an Arahat?” and “How did I become anArahat?” have but a single solution!In any case, we are wasting our time—we are as ridiculous with or Arahats as Herodthe Tetrarch with his peacocks! We pose Life with the question Why? and the firstanswer is: To obtain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.To attach meaning to this statement we must obtain that Knowledge andConversation: and when we have done that, we may proceed to the next Question. Itis no good asking it now.“There are purse-proud penniless ones that stand at the door of the tavern and revilethe guests.”3We attach little importance to the Reverend Out-at-Elbows, thundering in BareboardsChapel that the rich man gets no enjoyment from his wealth.Good, then. Let us obtain the volume entitled “The Book of the Sacred Magic ofAbramelin the Mage”; or the magical writings of that holy illuminated Man of God,Captain Fuller, and carry out fully their instructions.And only when we have succeeded, when we have put a colossal ! against our vital ?need we inquire whether after all the soldier is not going to develop spinal curvature.   3 Liber LXV, IV:12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK13Let us take the first step; let us sing:“I do not ask to see The distant path; one step’s enough for me.”But (you will doubtless say) I pith your ? itself with another ?: Why question life atall? Why not remain “a clean-living Irish gentleman” content with his handicap, andcontemptuous of card and pencil? Is not the Buddha’s goad “Everything is sorrow”little better than a currish whine? What do I care for old age, disease, and death?I’m a man, and a Celt at that. I spit on your snivelling Hindu prince, emasculatewith debauchery in the first place, and asceticism in the second. A weak, dirty, paltrycur, sir, your Gautama!Yes, I think I have no answer to that. The sudden apprehension of some vitalcatastrophe may have been the exciting cause of my conscious devotion to theattainment of Adeptship—but surely the capacity was there, inborn. Mere despairand desire can do little; anyway, the first impulse of fear was the passing spasm of anhour; the magnetism of the path itself was the true lure. It is as foolish to ask me“Why do you adep?” as to ask God “Why do you pardon?” C’est son métier.I am not so foolish as to think that my doctrine can ever gain the ear of the world. Iexpect than ten centuries hence the “nominal Crowleians” will be as pestilent andnumerous a body as the “nominal Christians” are to-day; for (at present) I have beenable to devise no mechanism for excluding them. Rather, perhaps, should I seek tofind them a niche in the shrine, just as Hinduism provides alike for those capable ofthe Upanishads and those whose intelligences hardly reaches up to the Tantras. Inshort, one must abandon the reality of religion for a sham, so that the religion may beuniversal enough for those few who are capable of its reality to nestle in its breast,and nurse their nature on its starry milk. But we anticipate!My message is then twofold; to the greasy bourgeois I preach discontent; I shockhim, I stagger him, I cut away earth from under his feet, I turn him upside down, Igive him hashish and make him run amok, I twitch his buttocks with the red-hottongs of my Sadistic fancy—until he feels uncomfortable.But to the man who is already as uneasy as St. Lawrence on his silver grill, who feelsthe Spirit stir in him, even as a woman feels, and sickens at, the first leap of the babein her womb, to him I bring the splendid vision, the perfume and the glory, theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. And to whosoever hathattained that height will I put a further Question, announce an further Glory.It is my misfortune and not my fault that I am bound to deliver this elementary Message.“Man has two sides; one to face the world with, One to show a woman that he loves her.”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE SOLDIER AND THE HUNCHBACK14We must pardon Browning his bawdy jest; for his truth is ower true!
