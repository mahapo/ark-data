INTRODUCTION TO “ASCENSION DAY AND PENTECOST” NOT a word to introduce my introduction! Let me instantly launch the Boat of Discourse on the Sea of Religious Speculation, in danger of the Rocks of Authority and the Quicksands of Private Interpretation, Scylla and Charybdis. Here is the strait; what God shall save us from shipwreck? If we choose to understand the Christian (or any other) religion literally, we are at once overwhelmed by its inherent impossibility. Our credulity is outraged, our moral sense shocked, the holiest foundations of our inmost selves assailed by no ardent warrior in triple steel, but by a loathy and dis-gusting worm. That this is so, the apologists for the religion in question, whichever it may be, sufficiently indicate (as a rule) by the very method of their apology. The alternative is to take the religion symbolically, esoterically; but to move one step in this direction is to start on a journey whose end cannot be determined. The religion, ceasing to be a tan-gible thing, an object uniform for all sane eyes, becomes rather that mist whereon the sun of the soul casts up, like Brocken spec-tres, certain vast and vague images of the beholder himself, with or without a glory en-compassing them. The function of the facts is then quite passive: it matters little or nothing whether the cloud be the red mist of Christianity, or the glimmering silver-white of Celtic Paganism; the hard grey dim-gilded of Buddhism, the fleecy opacity of Islam, or the mysterious medium of those ancient faiths which come up in as many colours as their investigator has moods.* * “In order to get over the ethical difficulties presented by the naïve naturalism of many parts of those Scriptures, in the divine authority of which he firmly believed, Philo borrowed from the Stoics (who had been in like straits in respect of Greek mythology) that great Excalibur which they had forged with infinite pains and skill—the method of allegorical interpretation. This mighty ‘two handed engine at the door’ of the theologian is warranted to make a speedy end of any and every moral or intellectual difficulty, by showing that, taken allegorically, or, as it is otherwise said “poetically’ or ‘in a spiritual sense,’ the plainest words mean whatever a pious interpreter desires they should mean.” (Huxley, “Evolution of Theology”).—A.C."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 If the student has advanced spiritually so that he can internally, infallibly perceive what is Truth, he will find it equally well symbolised in most external faiths. It is curious that Browning never turns his wonderful faculty of analysis upon the fundamental problems of religion, as it were an axe laid to the root of the Tree of Life. It seems quite clear that he knew what would result if he did so. We cannot help fancying that he was unwilling to do this. The proof of his knowledge I find in the following lines:— “I have read much, thought much, experienced much, Yet would rather die than avow my fear The Naples’ liquefaction may be false . . . I hear you recommend, I might at least Eliminate, decrassify my faith Since I adopt it: keeping what I must And leaving what I can ; such points as this . . . Still, when you bid me purify the same, To such a process I discern no end . . . First cut the liquefaction, what comes last But Fichte’s clever cut at God himself ? . . . I trust nor hand, nor eye, nor heart, nor brain To stop betimes: they all get drunk alike. The first step, I am master not to take. This is surely the apotheosis of wilful ignorance! We may think, perhaps, that Browning is “hedging” when, in the last paragraph, he says : “For Blougram, he believed, say, half he spoke,”* and hints at some deeper ground. It is useless to say, “This is Blougram and not Browning.” Browning could hardly have described the dilemma without seeing it. What he really believes is, perhaps, a mystery. That Browning, however, believes in universal salvation, though he nowhere (so far as I know) gives his reasons, save as they are summarised in the last lines of the below-quoted passage, is evident from the last stanza of “Apparent Failure,” and from his final pronouncement of the Pope on Guido, represented in Browning’s master-piece as a Judas without the decency to hang himself. “So (i.e., by suddenness of fate) may the truth be flashed out by one blow, And Guido see one instant and be saved. Else I avert my face nor follow him Into that sad obscure sequestered state Where God unmakes but to remake the soul He else made first in vain: which must not be. * Probably a record for a bishop.—A.C. This may be purgatory, but it sounds not unlike reincarnation. It is at least a denial of the doctrine of eternal punishment. As for myself, I took the first step years ago, quite in ignorance of what the last would lead to. God is indeed cut away—a cancer from the breast of truth. Of those philosophers, who from unas-sailable premisses draw by righteous deduction a conclusion against God, and then for His sake overturn their whole structure by an act of will, like a child breaking an ingenious toy, I take Mansel as my type.* Now, however, let us consider the esoteric idea-mongers of Christianity, Swedenborg, Anna Kingsford, Deussen and the like, of whom I have taken Caird as my example. I wish to unmask these people : I perfectly agree with nearly everything they say, but their claim to be Christians is utterly confusing, and lends a lustre to Christianity which is quite foreign. Deussen, for example, coolly discards nearly all the Old Testament, and, picking a few New Testament passages, often out of their context, claims his system as Christianity. Luther discards James. Kings-ford calls Paul the Arch Heretic. My friend the “Christian Clergyman” accepted Mark and Acts—until pushed. Yet Deussen is honest enough to admit that Vedanta teaching is identical, but clearer ! and he quite clearly and sensibly defines Faith—surely the most essential quality for the adherent to Christian dogma—as “being convinced on insufficient evidence.” Similarly the dying-to-live idea of Hegel (and Schopenhauer) claimed by Caird as the central spirit of Christianity is far older, in the Osiris Myth of the Egyptians. These ideas are all right, but they have no more to do with Christianity than the Metric System with the Great Pyramid. But see Piazzi Smyth!† Henry Morley has even the audacity to claim Shelley—Shelley !—as a Christian “in spirit.” Talking of Shelley :—With regard to my open denial of the personal Christian God, may it not be laid to my charge that I have dared to voice in bald language what Shelley * As represented by his Encylopædia article; not in such works as “Limits of Religious Thought.”—A.C. † An astronomer whose brain gave way. He prophesied the end of the world in 1881, from measurements made in the Great Pyramid."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE SWORD OF SONG 4 sang in words of surpassing beauty : for of course the thought in one or two passages of this poem is practically identical with that in certain parts of “Queen Mab” and “Prome-theus unbound.” But the very beauty of these poems (especially the latter) is its weakness : it is possible that the mind of the reader, lost in the sensuous, nay ! even in the moral beauty of the words, may fail to be impressed by their most important meaning. Shelley himself recognised this later : hence the direct and simple vigour of the “Masque of Anarchy.” It has often puzzled atheists that a man of Milton’s genius could have written as he did of Christianity. But we must not forget that Milton lived immediately after the most important Revolution in Religion and Politics of modern times : Shelley on the brink of such another Political upheaval. Shakespeare alone sat enthroned above it all like a god, and is not lost in the mire of controversy.* This, also, though “I’m no Shakespeare, as too probable,” I have endeavoured to avoid : yet I cannot but express the hope that my own enquiries into religion may be the reflection of the spirit of the age ; and that plunged as we are in the midst of jingoism and religious revival, we may be standing on the edge of some gigantic precipice, over which we may cast all our impedimenta of lies and trickeries, political, social, moral and religious, and (ourselves) take wings and fly. The comparison between myself and the masters of English thought I have named is unintentional though perhaps unavoidable ; and though the presumption is, of course, absurd, yet a straw will show which way the wind blows as well as the most beautiful and elaborate vane : and in this sense it is my pmost eage hope that I may not unjustly draw a comparison between myself and the great reformers of eighty years ago. * So it is usually supposed. Maybe I shall one day find words to combat, perhaps to overthrow, this position. P.S. As, for example, the Note to this Introduction. As a promise-keeper I am the original eleven stone three Peacherine.—A.C. I must apologise (perhaps) for the new note of frivolity in my work : due doubtless to the frivolity of my subject : these poems being written when I was an Advaitist and could not see why—everything being an illusion—there should be any particular object in doing or thinking anything. How I have found the answer will be evident from my essay on the subject.* I must indeed apologise to the illustrious Shade of Robert Browning for my audacious parody in title, style, and matter of his “Christmas Eve and Easter Day.” The more I read it the eventual anticlimax of that wonderful poem irritated me only the more. But there is hardly any poet living or dead who so commands alike my personal affection and moral admiration. My desire to find the Truth will be my pardon with him, whose sole life was spent in admiration of the Truth, though he never turned its formidable engines against the Citadel of the Almighty. If I be appealed of blasphemy of irreve-rence in my treatment of these subjects, I will take refuge in Browning’s own apology, from the very poem I am attacking : “I have done: and if any blames me, Thinking that merely to touch in brevity The topics I dwell on were unlawful— Or worse, that I trench with undue levity On the bounds of the holy and the awful— I praise the heart and pity the head of him, And refer myself to Thee, instead of him, Who head and heart alike discernest, Looking below light speech we utter Where frothy spume and frequent splutter Prove that the soul’s depths boil in earnest !” But I have after all little fear that I am seriously wrong. That I show to my critics the open door to the above city of refuge my be taken as merely another gesture of contemptuous pity, the last insult which may lead my antagonists to that surrender which is the truest victory.

Mallock, &c.) have been hitherto thrown away in attacking what is after all a problem of mere academic interest, the authorship of the plays our fathers accepted as those of Shakespeare. To me it seems of immediate and vital importance to do for Shakespeare what Verrall has done so ably for Euripides. The third tabernacle must be filled; Shaw and “the Human” must have their Superhuman companion. (This is not a scale: pithecanthropoid innuendo is to be deprecated.) Till now—as I write the sun bursts forth suddenly from a cloud, as if heralding the literary somersault of the twentieth century—we have been content to accept Shakespeare as orthodox, with common sense; moral to a fault, with certain Rabelasian leanings: a healthy tone (we say) pervades his work. Never believe it! The sex problem is his Speciality; a morbid decadence (so-called) is hidden i’ th’ heart o’ th’ rose. In other words, the divine William is the morning star to Ibsen’s dawn and Bernard Shaw’s effulgence. The superficial, the cynical, the misanthropic will demand proof of such a statement. Let it be our contemptuous indulgence to afford them what they ask. May I premise that, mentally obsessed, mono-maniac indeed, as we must now consider Shakespeare to have been on these points, he was yet artful enough to have concealed his * The lamented decease of the above gentleman forbids all hope (save through the courtesy of Sir Oliver Lodge) of the appearance of the companion article.—A.C. advanced views—an imperative necessity, if we consider the political situation, and the virginal mask under which Queen Bess hid the grotesque and hideous features of a Messaline. Clearly so, since but for this concealment even our Shakespearian scholars would have dis-covered so patent a fact. In some plays, too, of course, the poet deals with less dangerous topics. These are truly conventional, no doubt; we may pass them by; they are foreign to our purpose; but we will take that stupendous example of literary subterfuge—King Lear. Let my digress to the history of my own conversion. Syllogistically,—all great men (e.g. Shaw) are agnostics and subverters of morals. Shake-speare was a great man. Therefore Shakespeare was an agnostic and a subverter of morals. À priori this is then certain. But— Who killed Roussea? I, said Huxley (Like Robinson Cruesoe), With arguments true,—so I killed Rousseau! Beware of à priori! Let us find our facts, guided in the search by à priori methods, no doubt; but the result will this time justify us. Where would a man naturally hide his greatest treasure? In his most perfect treasure-house. Where shall we look for the truest thought of a great poet? In his greatest poem. What is Shakespeare’s greatest play? King Lear. In King Lear, then, we may expect the final statement of the poet’s mind. The passage that first put me on the track of the amazing discovery for which the world has to thank me is to be found in Act I. Sc. ii. ll. 132-149:— “This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune,—often the surfeit of our own behaviour,—we make guilty NOTES TO ASCENSION DAY AND PENTECOST. “Blind Chesterton is sure to err, And scan my work in vain; I am my own interpreter, And I will make it plain.” NOTE TO INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"NOTES 47 of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence ; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on ; an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star ! My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under ursa major ; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. ’Sfoot ! I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.” If there is one sound philosophical dictum in the play, it is this. (I am not going to argue with astrologers in the twentieth century.) It is one we can test. On questions of morality and religion opinions veer ; but if Shakespeare was a leader of thought, he saw through the humbug of the star-gazers ; if not, he was a credulous fool ; not the one man of his time, not a “debauched genius” (for Sir R. Burton in this phrase has in a sense antici-pated my discovery) but a mere Elizabethan. This the greatest poet of all time ? Then we must believe that Gloucester was right, and that eclipses caused the fall of Lear ! Observe that before this Shakespeare has had a sly dig or two at magic. In King John, “My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night” —but there is no eyewitness. So in Macbeth. In a host of spiritual suggestion there is always the rational sober explanation alongside to discredit the folly of the supernatural. Shakespeare is like his own Touchstone; he uses his folly as a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit. Here, however, the mask is thrown off for any but the utterly besotted ; Edmund’s speech stands up in the face of all time as truth ; it challenges the acclamation of the centuries. Edmund is then the hero ; more, he is Shakespeare’s own portrait of himself ; his ways are dark—(and, alas ! his tricks are vain !)—for why ? For the fear of the conven-tional world about him. He is illegitimate : Shakespeare is no true child of that age, but born in defiance of it and its prejudices. Having taken this important step, let us slew round the rest of the play to fit it. If it fits, the law of probability comes to our aid ; every coincidence multiplies the chance of our correctness in increasing proportion. We shall see—and you may look up your Proctor —that if the stars are placed just so by chance not law, then also it may be possible that Shakespeare was the wool-combing, knock-kneed, camel-backed, church-going, plaster- of-Paris, stick-in-the-mud our scholars have always made him. Edmund being the hero, Regan and Goneril must be the heroines. So nearly equal are their virtues and beauties that our poet cannot make up his mind which shall possess him—besides which, he wishes to drive home his arguments in favour of polygamy. But the great theme of the play is of course filial duty ; on this everything will turn. Here is a test : Whenever the question is discussed, let us see who speaks the language of sense, and who that of draggle-tailed emotionalism and tepid melodrama. In the first scene the heroines, who do not care for the old fool their father—as how could any sane women ? Remember Shakespeare is here about to show the folly of filial love as such—feel compelled, by an act of gracious generosity to a man they despise, yet pity, to say what they think will please the dotard’s vanity. Also no doubt the sound commercial instinct was touched by Lear’s promise to make acres vary as words, and they deter-mined to make a final effort to get some par-snips buttered after all. Shakespeare (it is our English boast) was no long-haired squiggle self-yclept bard ; but a business man—see Bishop Blougram’s appre-ciation of him as such. Shall we suppose him to have deliberately blackguarded in another his own best qualities? Note, too, the simple honesty of the divine sisters ! Others, more subtle, would have suspected a trap, arguing that such idiocy as Lear’s could not be genuine—Cordelia, the Madame Humbert of the play, does so; her over-cleverness leaves her stranded : yet by a certain sliminess of dissimulation, the oiliness of frankness, the pride that apes humility, she does catch the best king going. Yet it avails her little. She is hanged like the foul Vivien she is.* Cordelia’s farewell to her sistes shows up the characters of the three in strong relif. Cordelia—without a scrap of evidence to go on —accuses her sisters of hypocrisy and cruelty. (This could not have previously existed, or Lear would not have been deceived.) Regan gravely rebukes her ; recommends, as it were, a course of Six Easy Lessons in Mind- * I use the word Vivien provisionally, pending the appearance of an essay to prove that Lord Tennyson was in secret a reformer of our lax modern morals. No doubt, there is room for this. Vivien was perfectly right about the “cycle of strumpets and scoundels whom Mr. Tennyson has set revolving round the figure of his central wittol,” and she was the only one with the courage to say so, and the brains to strip of the barbarous glitter from an idiotic and phantom chivaly."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE SWORD OF SONG 48 ing Her Own Business; and surely it was unparalled insolence on the part of a dis- missed girl to lecture her more favourite sister on the very point for which she herself was at that moment being punished. It is the spite of baffled dissimulation against triumphant honesty. Goneril adds a word of positive advice. “You,” she says in effect, “who prate of duty thus, see you show it unto him unto who you owe it.” That this advice is wasted is clear from Act V. Sc. iii., where the King of France takes the first trivial opportunity* to be free of the vile creature he had so foolishly married. Cordelia goes, and the sisters talk together. Theirs is the language of quiet sorrow for an old man’s failing mind ; yet a most righteous determination not to allow the happiness of the English people to depend upon his whims. Bad women would have rejoiced in the banish-ment of Kent, whom they already knew to be their enemy ; these truly good women regret it. “Such unconstant stars are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment” (Act I. Sc. i. ll. 304-5). In Scene ii. Edmund is shown ; he feels himself a man, more than Edgar : a clear-headed, brave, honourable man ; but with no maggots. The injustice of his situation strikes him ; he determines not to submit.† This is the attitude of a strong man, and a righteous one. Primogeniture is wrong enough ; the other shame, no fault of his, would make the blood of any free man boil. Gloucester enters, and exhibits himself as a prize fool by shouting in disjointed phrases what everybody knew. Great news it is, of course, and on discovering Edmund, he can think of nothing more sensible than to ask for more ! “Kent banished thus ! And France in choler parted ! And the king gone to-night ! sub-scrib’d his power ! Confin’d to exhibition ! All this done upon the gad ! Edmund, how now ! what news ?” (Act I. Sc. ii. ll 23-26). Edmund “forces a card” by the simple device of a prodigious hurry to hide it. Glou-cester gives vent to his astrological futilities, and falls to axiomania in its crudest form,— “We have seen the best of our time : machi-nations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our grave” (Sc. ii. ll. 125-127). Edmund, once rid of him, gives us the * He leaves her in charge of Marshal Le Fer, whom alone he could trust to be impervious to her wiles, he being devoted to another ; for as an in-valuable contemporary MS. has it, “Seccotine colle même Le Fer.” † This may be, but I think should not be, used as an argument to prove the poet an illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth. plainest sense we are likely to here for the rest of our lives ; then, with the prettiest humour in the world takes the cue of his father’s ab-surdity, and actually plays it on his enemy. Edgar’s leg is not so easily pulled—(“How long have you been a sectary astronomical ?” ll. 169, 170)—and the bastard hero, taking alarm, gets right down to business. In Scene iii. we find Lear’s senile dementia taking the peculiarly loathesome form familiar to alienists—this part of my subject is so un-pleasant that I must skim over it ; I only mention it to show how anxious Shakespeare is to show his hidden meaning, otherwise his naturally delicate mind would have avoided the depiction of such phenomena. All this prepares us for Scene iv., in which we get a glimpse of the way Lear’s attendants habitually behave. Oswald, who treats Lear throughout with perfct respect, and only shows honest independence in refusing to obey a man who is not his master, is insulted in language worthier of a bargee than a king ; and when he remonstrates in dignified and temper-ate language is set upon by the ruffianly Kent. Are decent English people to compain when Goneril insists that this sort of thing shall not occur in a royal house ? She does so, in lan-guage nobly indignant, yet restrained : Lear, in the hideous, impotent rage of senility, calls her —his own daughter—a bastard (no insult to her, but to himself or his wife, mark ye well!). Albany enters—a simple, ordely-minded man ; he must not be confused with Cornwall ; he is at the last Lear’s dog ; yet even he in decent measured speech sides with his wife. Is Lear quited ? No ! He utters the most horrible curse, not excepting that of Count Cenci, that a father ever pronounced. Incoherent threats succeed to the boilings-over of the hideous malice of a beastly mind ; but a hundred knights are a hundred knights, and a threat is a threat. Goneril had not fulfilled her duty to herself, to her people, had she allowed this monster of mania to go on. I appeal to the medical profession; if one doctor will answer me that a man using Lear’s language should be allowed control of a hun-dred armed ruffians [in the face of Kent’s behaviour we know what weight to attach to Lear’s defence : “Detested kite ! thou liest” (I. iv. ll. 286)], should ever be allowed outside a regularly appointed madhouse, I will cede the point, and retire myself into an asylum. In fact, Lear is going mad; the tottering intellect, at no time strong (“’Tis the infirmity of age ; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himsef,” I. i. ll. 296-7), is utterly cast down by drink and debauchery : he even sees it himself, and with a pointless bestiality from the Fool, fit companion for the—king—and in that word"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"NOTES 49 we see all the concentrated loathing of the true Shakespeare for a despotism, massed in one lurid flame, phantasmagoric horror, the grim First Act rolls down. II. Act II. Sc. i. adds little new to our thesis, save that in line 80 we see Gloucester (ignorant of his own son’s handwriting!) accept the forged letter as genuine, as final proof, with not even the intervention of a Bertillon to excuse so palpable a folly, so egregious a crime. What father of to-day would disin- herit, would hunt down to death, a beloved son, on such evidence? Or are we to take it that the eclipse gave proof unshakable of a phenomenon so portentous ? In Scene ii. we have another taste of Kent’s gentlemanly demeanour ; let our conventionalist interpreters defend this unwarrantable bullying if they dare ! Another might be so gross, so cowardly ; but not our greatest poet ! A good portion of this play, as will be shown later, is devoted to a bitter assault upon the essentially English notion that the pugilist is the supreme device of the Creator for furthering human happiness. (See “Cashel Byron’s Pro-fession” for a similar, though more logical and better-worded, attack.) Coarse and violent language continues to disgrace Lear’s follower ; only Gloucester, the unconscionable ass and villian of Scene i., has a word to say in his defence. In Scene iii. we have a taste of Edgar’s quality. Had this despicable youth the con-sciosness of innocence, or even common courage, he had surely stood to his trial. Not he ! He plays the coward’s part—and his disguise is not even decent. In Scene iv. we are shown the heroic sisters in their painful task of restraining, always with the utmost gentleness of word and demeanour, the headstrong passions of the miserable king. Lear, at first quiet in stating his fancied wrongs “Reg. ‘I am glad to see your highness.’ Lear. ‘Regan, I think you are ; I know what reason I have to think so : if thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb, Sepulchring an adult’ress. (To Kent). O ! are your free ? Some other time for that. Beloved Regan, Thy sister’s naught : O Regan ! she hath tied Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here : (Points to his heart). I can scarce speak to thee ; thou’lt not believe with how deprav’d a quality—O Regan !’ Reg. ‘I pray you sir, take patience. I have hope.’ ”) (ll. 130-139), an excusable speech, at the first hint that he is not to have it all his own way, falls a-cursing again like the veriest drab or scullion Hamlet ever heard. Here is a man, deprived on just cause of half a useless company of retainers. Is this wrong (even were it wrong) such as to justify the horrible curses of ll. 164-168, “All the stor’d vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrate-ful top ! Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness ! You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes !” With this he makes his age contemp-tible by the drivel-pathos of ll. 156-158, “Dear daughter, I confess that I am old ; Age is unnecessary : on my knees I beg (Kneeling) That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food,” begging what none ever thought to deny him. Yet such is the patience of Goneril that even when goaded by all this infamous Billingsgate into speech, her rebuke is the temperate and modest ll. 198-200. “Why not by the hand, sir ? How have I offended ? All’s not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so.” If we ask a parallel for such meekness under insult, calumny, and foul abuse, we must seek it not in a human story, but a divine. The heroines see that no half measures will do, and Lear is stripped of all the murderous retinue—what scum they are is shown by the fact that not one of them draws sword for him, or even follows him into the storm—to which his bad heart clings ; yet for him—for him in spite of all his loathsomeness, his hatred, his revengefulness—is Regan’s gentle and loving, “For his particular, I’ll receive him gladly.” III In Act III. we have another illustration of the morality that passed current with the Tudors, and which only a Shakespeare had the courage to attack. Kent does not stick at treachery—he makes one gulp of treason—straining at the gnat of discipline, he swallows the camel of civil war. It was then, and is even now, the practice of some—for example, the emigrés of the French Revolution—to invite foreign invasion as a means of securing domestic reaction. The blackguardism implied is beyond language : Shakesepare was perhaps thinking of the pro-posal, in Mary’s reign, to react to Romanism by the aid of Spanish troops. But he will go further than this, will our greatest poet; it were ill that the life of even one child should atone for mere indignity or discomfort to another, were he the greatest in the realm. To-day we all agree; we smile or sneer if any one should differ. “King Lear got caught in the rain—let us go and kill a million men !” is an argument not much understood of Radical Clubs, and even Jingos would pause, did they but take the precaution of indulging in a mild aperient before recording their opinions."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE SWORD OF SONG 50 In Scenes iii., vi., and vii., Edmund, disgusted beyond all meaure with Gloucester’s infamies, honourably and patriotically denounces him. The other scenes depict the miseries which follow the foolish and the unjust ; and Nemesis falls upon the ill-minded Gloucester. Yet Shakespeare is so appreciative of the virtue of compassion (for Shakespeare was, as I shall hope to prove one day, a Buddhist) that Corn-wall, the somewhat cruel instrument of eternal Justice, is killed by his servant. Regan avenges her husband promptly, and I have little doubt that this act of excessive courtesy towards a man she did not love is the moral cause of her unhappy end. I would not that we should not attempt to draw any opinions as to the author’s design from the conversation of the vulgar ; even had we not Coriolanus to show us what he thought. IV. Act IV. develops the plot and is little germane to our matter, save that we catch a glimpse of the unspeakably vile Cordelia, with no pity for her father’s serious condition (though no doubt he deserved all he got, he was now harmless and should have inspired compassion), hanging to him in the hope that he would no reverse his banishment and make her (after a bloody victory) sole heiress of great England. And were any doubt left in our minds as to who really was the hero of the play, the partizan-ship of France should settle it. Shakespeare has never any word but ridicule for the French ; never aught but praise of England and love for her : are we to suppose that in his best play he is to stultify all his other work and insult the English for the benefit of the ridiculed and hated Frenchmen ? Moreover, Cordelia reckons without her host. The British bulldogs make short work of the invaders and rebels, doubtless with the con-nivance of the King of France, who, with great and praiseworthy acuteness, forsees that Cordelia will be hanged, thus liberating him from his “most filthy bargain” : there is but one alarum, and the whole set of scoundrels surrender. Note this well; it is not by brute force that the battle is won; for even if we exonerate the King of France, we may easily believe that the moral strength of the sisters cowed the French. This is the more evident, since in Act V. Shakespeare strikes his final blow at the absurdity of the duel, when Edmund is dis-honestly slain by the beast Edgar. Yet the poet’s faith is still strong : wound up as his muse is to tragedy, he retains in Edmund the sublime heroism, the simple honesty, of the true Christian ; at the death of his beloved mistresses he cries, “I was contracted to them both : all three Now marry in an instant——” At the moment of death his great nature (self-accusatory, as the finest so often are) asserts itself, and he forgives even the vilest of the human race,—“I pant for life : some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature.1 Quickly send, Be brief in it, to the castle ; for my writ Is on the life Lear and on Cordelia. Nay, send in time.” (ll. 245-249). And in that last supreme hour of agony he claims Regan as his wife, as if by accident ; it is not the passionate assertion of a thing doubt-ful, but the natural reference to a thing well known and indisputable. And in the moment of his despair ; confronted with the dead bodies of the splendid sisters, the catafalque of all his hopes, he can exclaim in spiritual triumph over material disaster—the victory of a true man’s spirit over Fate— “Yet Edmund was beloved.” Edgar is left alive with Albany, alone of all that crew; and if remorse could touch their brutal and callous souls (for the degeneration of the weakling, well-meaning Albany, is a minor tragedy), what hell could be more horrible than the dragging out of a cancerous existence in the bestial world of hate their hideous hearts had made, now, even for better men, for ever dark and gloomy, robbed of the glory of the glowing Gonerial, the royal Regan, and only partially redeemed by the absence of the harlot Cordelia and the monster Lear. V. It may possibly be objected by the censorious, by the effete parasites of a grim conventionalism, that I have proved too much. Even by con-ventional standards Edmund, Goneril, and Regan appear angels. Even on the moral point, the sisters, instead of settling down to an enlightened and by no means overcrowded polygamy, prefer to employ poison. This is perhaps true, of Goneril at least; Regan is, if one may distinguish between star and star, somewhat the finer character. This criticism is perhaps true in part ; but I will not insult the intelligence of my readers. I will leave it to them to take the obvious step and work backwards to the re-exaltion of Lear, Cordelia, Edgar and company, to the heroic fields of their putty Elysium (putty, not 1 This may merely mean “despite the fact that I am dying—though I am almost too weak to speak.” If so, the one phrase in the play which seems to refute our theory is disposed of.

While their Buddha I attack.30—Many Buddhists think I fill the bill with the following remarks on— PANSIL. Unwilling as I am to sap the foundations of the Buddhist religion by the introduction of Porphyry’s terrible catapult, Allegory, I am yet compelled by the more fearful ballista of Aristotle, Dilemma. This is the two-handed engine spoken of by the prophet Milton!* This is the horn of the prophet Zeruiah, and with this am I, though no Syrian, utterly pushed, till I find myself back against the dead wall of Dogma. Only now realising how dead a wall that is, do I turn and try the effect of a hair of the dog that bit me, till the orthodox “literary”† school of Buddhists, as grown at Rangoon, exclaim with Lear: “How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is To have an intellect!” How is this? Listen, and hear! I find myself confronted with the crux: that a Buddhist, convinced intellectually and philo-sophically of the truth of the teaching of Gotama; a man to whom Buddhism is the equivalent of scientific methods of Thought; an expert in dialectic whose logical faculty is bewildered, whose critical admiration is ex-torted by the subtle vigour of Buddhist reason-ing; I am yet forced to admit that, this being so, the Five Precepts‡ are mere nonsense. If the Buddha spoke scientifically, not popularly, not rhetorically, then his precepts are not his. We must reject them or we must interpret them. We must inqure: Are they meant to be obeyed? Or—and this is my theory—are they sarcastic and biting criticisms on existence, illustrations of the First Noble Truth; reasons, as it were, for the apotheosis of annihilation? I shall so that this is so. Let me consider them “precept upon precept,” if the introduction of the Hebrew visionary is not too strong meat for the Little Mary§ of a Buddhist audience. * Lycidas, line 130. † The school whose Buddhism is derived from the Canon, and who ignore the degradation of the professors of the religion, as seen in practice. ‡ The obvious caveat which logicians will enter against these remarks is that Pansil is the Five Virtues rather than Precepts. Etymologically this is so. However, we may regard this as a clause on my side of the argument, not against it; for in my view these are virtues, and the impossibility of attaining them is the cancer of existence. Indeed, I support the etymology as against the futile bigotry of certain senile Buddhists of to-day. And, since it is the current interpretation of Buddhist thought that I attack, I but show myself the better Buddhist in the act.—A.C. § A catch word for the stomach, from J.M. Barrie’s play “Little Mary.” THE FIRST PRECEPT. This forbids the taking of life in any form.* What we have to note is the impossi-bility of performing this; if we can prove it to be so, either Buddha was a fool, or his com- mand was rhetorical, like those of Yahweh to Job, or of Tannhäuser to himself— “ Go! seek the stars and count them and explore! Go! sift the sands beyond a starless sea!” Let us consider what the words can mean. The “taking of life” can only mean the re-duction of living protoplasm to dead matter: or, in a truer and more psychological sense, the destruction of personality. Now, in the chemical changes involved in Buddha’s speaking this command, living pro-toplasm was changed into dead matter. Or, on the other horn, the fact (insisted upon most strongly by the Buddha himself, the central and cardinal point of his doctrine, the shrine of that Metaphysic which isolates it absolutely from all other religious metaphysic, which allies it with Agnostic Metaphysis) that the Buddha who had spoken this command was not the same as the Buddha before he had spoken it, lies the proof that the Buddha, by speaking this command, violated it. More, not only did he slay himself; he breathed in millions of living organisms and slew them. He could nor eat nor drink nor breathe without murder implicit in each act. Huxley cites the “pitiless microsco-pist” who showed a drop of water to the Brahmin who boasted himself “Ahimsa”—harmless. So among the “rights” of a Bhikkhu is medicine. He who takes quinine does so with the deliber-ate intention of destroying innumerable living beings; whether this is done by stimulating the phagocytes, or directly, is morally indifferent. How such a fiend incarnate, my dear brother Ananda Maitriya, can call him “cruel and cowardly” who only kills a tiger, is a study in the philosophy of the mote and the beam!† Far be it from me to sugest that this is a defence of breathing, eating and drinking.

Let us pass on. THE SECOND PRECEPT The Second Precept is directed against theft. Theft is the appropriation to one’s own use of that to which another has a right. Let us see therefore whether or no the Buddha was a thief. The answer is of course in the affirmative. For to issue a command is to attempt to deprive another of his most precious possession—the right to do as he will; that is, unless, with the predestinarians, we hold that action is determined absolutely, in which case, of course, a command is as absurd as it is unavoidable. Excluding this folly, therefore, we may conclude that if the command be obeyed—and those of Buddha have gained a far larger share of obedience that those of any other teacher—the Enlightened One was not only a potential but an actual thief. Further, all voluntary action limits in some degree, however minute, the volition of others. If I breathe, I diminish the stock of oxygen available on the planet. In those far distant ages when Earth shall be as dead as the moon is to-day, my breathing now will have robbed some being then living of the dearest necessity of life. That the theft is minute, incalculably trifling, is no answer to the moralist, to whom degree is not known; nor to the scientist, who sees the chain of nature miss no link. If, on the other hand, the store of energy in the universe be indeed constant (whether infinite or no), if personality be indeed delusion, then theft becomes impossible, and to forbid it is absurd. We may argue that even so temporary theft may exist; and that this is so is to my mind no doubt the case. All theft is temporary, since even a millionaire must die; also it is universal, since even a Buddha must breathe. THE THIRD PRECEPT This precept, against adultery, I shall touch but lightly. Not that I consider the subject unpleasant—far from it!—but since the English section of my readers, having unclean minds, will otherwise find a fulcrum therein for their favourite game of slander. Let it suffice if I say that the Buddha—in spite of the ridicu-lous membrane legend,* one of those foul follies which idiot devotees invent only too freely—was a confirmed and habitual adulterer. It * Membrum virile illius in membrana inclusum esse aiunt, ne copulare posset. would be easy to argue with Hegel-Huxley that he who thinks of an act commits it (cf. Jesus also in this connection, though he only knows the creative value of desire), and that since A and not-A are mutually limiting, therefore interdependent, therefore identical, he who forbids an act commits it; but I feel that this is no place for metaphysical hair-splitting; let us prove what we have to prove in the plainest way. I would premise in the first place that to commit adultery in the Divorce Court sense is not here in question. It assumes too much proprietary right of a man over a woman, that root of all abomina-tion !—the whole machinery of inheritance, property, and all the labyrinth of law. We may more readily assume that the Buddha was (apparently at least) condemning incontinence. We know that Buddha had abandoned his home ; true, but Nature has to be reckoned with. Volition is no necessary condition of offence. “I didn’t mean to” is a poor excuse for an officer failing to obey an order. Enough of this—in any case a minor ques-tion; since even on the lowest moral grounds—and we, I trust, soar higher!—the error in question may be resolved into a mixture of murder, theft and intoxication. (We consider the last under the Fifth Precept.) THE FOURTH PRECEPT Here we come to what in a way is the fundamental joke of these precepts. A command is not a lie, of course; possibly cannot be; yet surely an allegorical order is one in essence, and I have no longer a shadow of a doubt that these so-called “precepts” are a species of savage practical joke. Apart from this there can hardly be much doubt, when critical exegesis has done its damnedest on the Logia of our Lord, that Buddha did at some time commit himself to some statement. “(Something called) Con-sciousness exists” is, said Huxley, the irreducible minimum of the pseudo-syllogism, false even for an enthymeme, “Cogito, ergo sum !” This proposition he bolsters up by stating that whoso should pretend to doubt it, would thereby but confirm it. Yet might it not be said “(Something called) Consciousness appears to itself to exist,” since Consciousness is itself the only witness to that confirmation ? Not that even now we can deny some kind of existence to consciousness, but that it should be a more real existence than that of a reflec-tion is doubtful, incredible, even inconceivable. If by consciousness we mean the normal con-sciousness, it is definitely untrue, since the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"NOTES 55 Dhyanic consciousness includes it and denies it. No doubt “something called” acts as a kind of caveat to the would-be sceptic, though the phrase is bad, implying a “calling.” But we can guess what Huxley means. No doubt Buddha’s scepticism does not openly go quite so far as mine—it must be remembered that “scepticism” is merely the indication of a possible attitude, not a belief, as so many good fool folk thing; but Buddha not only denies “Cogito, ergo sum”; but “Cogito, ergo non sum.” See Sabbasava Sutta, par. 10.* At any rate, Sakkyaditthi, the delusion of personality, is in the very forefront of his doctrines; and it is this delusion that is con-stantly and inevitably affirmed in all normal consciousness. That Dhyanic thought avoids it is doubtful; even so, Buddha is here repre-sented as giving precepts to ordinary people. And if personality be delusion, a lie is involved in the command of one to another. In short, we all lie all the time; we are compelled to it by the nature of things themselves—para-doxical as that seems—and the Buddha knew it! THE FIFTH PRECEPT. At last we arrive at the end of our weary journey—surely in this weather we may have a drink! East of Suez,† Trombone-Macaulay (as I may surely say, when Browning writes Banjo-Byron‡) tells us, a man may raise a Thirst. No, shrieks the Blessed One, the Perfected One, the Enlightened One, do not drink! It is like the streets of Paris when they were placarded with rival posters— Ne buvez pas de l’Alcool ! L’Alcool est un poison ! and Buvez de l’Alcool ! L’Alcool est un aliment ! We know now that alcohol is a food up to a certain amount; the precept, good enough for a rough rule as it stands, will not bear close inspection. What Buddha really commands with that grim humour of his, is: Avoid Intoxication. But what is intoxication? unless it be the loss of power to use perfectly a truth-telling set of faculties. If I walk unsteadily it is owing to nervous lies—and so for all the phenomena of drunkenness. But a lie involves the assump- * Quoted in “Science and Buddhism”, s.

KIPLING. † “While as for Quilp Hop o’ my Thumb there Banjo-Byron that twangs the strum-strum there.” —BROWNING, Pachiarotto (said of A. Austin) tion of some true standard, and this can no-where be found. A doctor would tell you, moreover, that all food intoxicates: all, here as in all the universe, of every subject and in every predicate, is a matter of degree. Our faculties never tell us true; our eyes say flat when our fingers say round; our tongue sends a set of impressions to our brain which our hearing declares non-existent—and so on. What is this delusion of personality but a profound and centrally-seating intoxication of the consciousness ? I am intoxicated as I address these words; you are drunk—beastly drunk !—as you read them; Buddha was as drunk as a British officer when he uttered his besotted command. There, my dear children, is the conclusion to which we are brought if you insist that he was serious! I answer No ! Alone among men then liv-ing, the Buddha was sober, and saw Truth. He, who was freed from the coils of the reat serpent Theli coiled round the universe, he knew how deep the slaver of that snake had entered into us, infecting us, rotting our very bones with poisonous drunkenness. And so his cutting irony—drink no intoxicating drinks! ———— When I go to take Pansil,* it is in no spirit of servile morality; it is with keen sorrow gnawing at my heart. These five causes of sorrow are indeed the heads of the serpent of Desire. Four at least of them snap their fans on me in and by virtue of my very act of receiving the commands, and of promising to obey them; if there is a little difficulty about the fifth, it is an omission easily rectified—and I think we should all make a point about that; there is great virtue in completeness. Yes! Do not believe that the Buddha was a fool ; that he asked men to perform the impossible or the unwise.† Do not believe that the sorrow of existence is so trivial that easy rules * To “take Pansil” is to vow obedience to these Precepts. † I do not propose to dilate on the moral truth which Ibsen has so long laboured to make clear: that no hard and fast rule of life can be universally applicable. Also, as in the famous case of the lady who saved (successively) the lives of her husband, her father, and her brother, the precepts clash. To allow to die is to kill—all this is obvious to the most ordinary thinkers. These precepts are of course excellent general guides for the vulgar and ignorant, but you and I, dear reader, are wise and clever, and know better. Nichtwar?

PREFACE* In the fevered days and nights under the Empire that perished in the struggle of 1870, * To a collection of MSS illustrating the “Psy-chopathia Sexualis of von Kraft-Ebing [Crowley’s White Stains—T.S.]. The names of the parties have been changed. that whirling tumult of pleasure, scheming, success, and despair, the minds of men had a trying ordeal to pass through. In Zola’s “La Curée” we see how such ordinary and natural characters as those of Saccard, Maxime, and the incestuous heroine, were twisted and dis-torted from their normal sanity, and sent whirl-ing into the jaws of a hell far more affrayant than the mere cheap and nasty brimstone Sheol which is a Shibboleth for the dissenter, and with which all classes of religious humbug, from the Pope to the Salvation ranter, from the Mormon and the Jesuit to that mongrol mixture of the worst features of both, the Ply-mouth Brother, have scared their illiterate, since hypocrisy was born, with Abel, and spiritual tyranny with Jehovah! Society, in the long run, is eminently sane and practical ; under the Second Empire it ran mad. If these things are done in the green tree of Society, what shall be done in the dry tree of Bo-hemianism? Art always has a suspicion to fight against ; always some poor mad Max Nordau is handy to call everything outside the kitchen the asylum. Here, however, there is a substratum of truth. Consider the intolerable long roll of names, all tainted with glorious madness. Baudelaire, the diabolist, debauchee of sadism, whose dreams are nightmares and whose waking hours delerium; Rollinat the necrophile, the poet of phthisis, the anxiomaniac; Péledan, the high priest—of non-sense ; Mendés, frivolous and scoffing sensualist ; besides a host of others, most alike in this, that, below the cloak of madness and depravity, the true heart of genius burns. No more terrible period than this is to be found in literature ; so many great minds, of which hardly one comes to fruition ; such seed of genius, such a harvest of—whirlwind ! Even a barren waste of sea is less saddening than one strewn with wreckage. In England such wild song found few fol-lowers of any worth or melody. Swinburne stands on his solitary pedastal above the vulgar crowds of priapistic plagiarists ; he alone caught the fierce frenzy of Baudelaire’s brandied shrieks, and his First Series of Poems and Ballads was the legitimate echo of that not fierier note. But English Art as a whole was unmoved, at any rate not stirred to any depth, by this wave of debauchery. The great thinkers maintained the even keel, and the windy waters lay not for their frailer barks to cross. There is one exception of note, till this day unsus-pected, in the person of George Archibald Bishop. In a corner of Paris this young poet (for in his nature the flower of poesy did spring, did even take root and give some promise of | a brighter bloom, till stricken and blasted in latter years by the lightning of his own sins) was steadily writing day after day, night after"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"NOTES 57 night, often working forty hours at a time, work which he destined to entrace the world. All England should ring with his praises; by-and-by the whole world should know his name. Of these works none of the longer and more ambitious remains. How they were lost, and how those fragments we possess were saved, is best told by relating the romantic and almost incredible story of his life. The known facts of this life are few, vague, and unsatisfactory ; the more definite state-ments lack corroboration, and almost the only source at the disposal of the biographer is the letters of Mathilde Doriac to Mdme. J. S., who has kindly placed her portfolio at my service. A letter dated October 15, 1866, indicates that our author was born on the 23rd of that month. The father and mother of George, were, at least on the surface, of an extraordinary re-ligious turn of mind. Mathilde’s version of the story, which has its source in our friend himself, agrees almost word for word with a letter of the Rev. Edw. Turle to Mrs. Cope, recommending the child to her care. The substance of the story is as follows. The parents of George carried their religious ideas to the point of never consummating their marriage !* This arrangement does not seem to have been greatly appreciated by the wife ; at least one fine morning she was found to be enceinte. The foolish father never thought of the hypothesis which commends itself most readily to a man of the world, not to say a man of science, and adopted that of a second Messiah ! He took the utmost pains to con- ceal the birth of the child, treated everybody who came to the house as an emissary of Herod, and finally made up his mind to flee into Egypt ! Like most religious maniacs, he never had an idea of his own, but distorted the beautiful and edifying events of the Bible into insane and ridiculous ones, which he proceeded to plagiarise. On the voyage out the virgin mother became enamoured, as was her wont, of the nearest male, in this case a fellow-traveller. He, being well able to support her in the luxury which she desired, easily persuaded her to leave the boat with him by stealth. A small sailing vessel conveyed them to Malta, where they disappeared. The only trace left in the books of earth records that this fascinating character was accused, four years later, in Vienna, of poisoning her paramour, but thanks to the wealth and influence of her newer lover, she escaped. The legal father, left by himself with a squall-ing child to amuse, to appease in his tantrums, * Will it be believed that a clergyman (turned Plymouth Brother and schoolmaster) actually made an identical confession to a boy of ten years old ? and to bring up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, was not a little perplexed by the sudden disappearance of his wife. At first he supposed that she had been translated, but, finding that she had not left behind the traditional mantle behind her, he abandoned this suppo-sition in favour of quite a different, and indeed a more plausible one. He now believed her to be the scarlet woman of the Apocalypse, with variations. On arrival in Egypt he hired an old native nurse, and sailed for Odessa. Once in Russia he could find Gog and Magog, and present to them the child as Antichrist. For he was no persuaded that he himself was the First Beast, and would ask the sceptic to count his seven heads and ten horns. The heads, however, rarely totted up accurately. At this point the accounts of Mr. Turle and Mathilde diverge slightly. The cleric affirms that he was induced by a Tartar lady, of an honourable and ancient profession, to accom-pany her to Tibet “to be initiated into the mysteries.” He was, of course, robbed and murdered with due punctuality, in the town of Kiev. Mathilde’s story is that he travelled to Kiev on the original quest, and died of typhoid or cholera. In any case, he died at Kiev in 1839. This fixes the date of the child’s birth at 1837. His faithful nurse conveyed him safely to England, where his relatives provided for his maintenance and education. With the close of this romantic chapter in his early history we lose all reliable traces for some years. One flash alone illumines the darkness of his boyhood ; in 1853, after being prepared for confirmation, he cried out in full assembly, instead of kneeling to receive the blessing of the officating bishop, “I renounce for ever this idolatrous church ;” and was quietly removed. He told Mathilde Doriac that he had been to Eton and Cambridge—neither institution, how-ever, preserves any record of scuh admission. The imagination of George, indeed, is tremend-ously fertile with regard to events in his own life. His own story is that he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1856, and was sent down two years later for an article which he had contributed to some University of College Magazine. No confirmation of any sort is to be found anywhere with regard to these or any other statements of our author. There is, however, no doubt that in 1861 he quarreled with his family ; went over to Paris, where he settled down, at first, like every tufthead, somewhere in the Quartier Latin ; later, with Mathilde Doriac, the noble woman who became his mistress and held to him through all the terrible tragedy of his moral, mental, and physical life, in the Rue du Faubourg-Poisson-nière. At his house there the frightful scene"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE SWORD OF SONG 58 of ’68 took place, and it was there too that he was apprehended after the murders which he describes so faithfully in “Abysmos.” He had just finished this poem with a shriek of triumph, and had read it through to the appalled Mathilde “avec des yeux de flamme et de gestes incohérentes,” when, foaming at the mouth, and “hurlant de blasphèmes indi- cibles,” he fell upon her with extraordinary violence of passion ; the door opened, officers appeared, the arrest was effected. He was com-mitted to an asylum, for there could be no longer any doubt of his complete insanity ; for three weeks he had been raving with absinthe and satyriasis. He survived his confinement no long time ; the burning of the asylum with its in-mates was one of the most terrible events of the war of 1870. So died one of the most talented Englishmen of his century, a man who for wide knowledge of men and things was truly to be envied, yet one who sold his birthright for a mess of beastlier pottage than ever Esau guzzled, who sold soul and body to Satan for sheer love of sin, whose mere lust of perversion is so intense that it seems to absorb every other emotion and interest. Never since God woke light from chaos has such a tragedy been un-rolled before men, step after step toward the lake of Fire ! At his house all his writings were seized, and, it is believed, destroyed. The single most fortunate exception is that of a superbly jewelled writing-case, now in the possession of the present editor, in which were found the MSS. which are here published. Mathilde, who knew how he treasured its contents, pre-served it by saying to the officer, “But, sir, that is mine.” On opening this it was found to contain, besides these MSS., his literary will. All MSS. were to be published thirty years after his death, not before. He would gain no spurious popularity as a reflection of the age he lived in. “Tennyson,” he says, “will die before sixty years are gone by : if I am to be beloved of men, it shall be because my work is for all times and all men, because it is greater than all the gods of chance and change, because it has the heart of the human race beating in every line.” This is a patch of magenta to mauve, undoubtedly ; but — ! The present collection of verses will hardly be popular ; if the lost works turn up, of course it may be that there may be found “shelter for songs that recede.” Still, even here, one is, on the whole, more attracted than repelled ; the author has enormous power, and he never scruples to use it, to drive us half mad with horror, or, as in his earlier most exquisite works, to move us to the noblest thoughts and deeds. True, his debt to contemporary writers is a little obvious here and there; but these are small blemish on a series of poems whose originality is always striking, and often dread-ful, in its broader features. We cannot leave George Bishop without a word of inquiry as to what became of the heroic figure of Mathilde Doriac. It is a bitter task to have to write in cold blood about the dread-ful truth about her death. She had the mis-fortune to contract, in the last few days of her life with him, the same terrible disease which he described in the last poem of his collection. This shock, coming so soon after, and, as it were, as an unholy perpetual reminder of the madness and sequestration of her lover, no less than his infidelity, unhinged her mind, and she shot herself on July 5, 1869. Her last letter to Madame J—— S—— is one of the tenderest and most pathetic ever written. She seems to have been really loved by George, in his wild, infidel fashion : “All Night” and “Victory,” among others, are obviously in-spired by her beauty ; and her devotion to him, the abasement of soul, the prostitution of body, she underwent for and with him, is one of the noblest stories life has known. She seems to have dived with him, yet ever trying to raise his soul from the quagmire ; if God is just at all, she shall stand more near to His right hand that all the vaunted virgins who would soil no hem of vesture to save their brother from the worm that dieth not ! The Works of George Archibald Bishop will speak for themselves ; it would be both im-pertinent and superfluous in me to point out in detail their many and varied excellences, or their obvious faults. The raison d’être, though, of their publication, is worthy of especial notice. I refer to their psychological sequence, which agrees with their chronological order. His life-history, as well as his literary remains, gives us an idea of the progression of diabolism as it really is, not as it is painted. Note also, (1) the increase of selfishness in pleasure, (2) the diminution of his sensibility to physical charms. Pure and sane is his early work ; then he is carried into the outer current of the great vortex of Sin, and whirls lazilky though the sleepy waters of mere sensualism ; the pace quickens, he grows fierce in the mysteries of Sapphism and the cult of Venus Aversa with women ; later of the same forms of vice with men, all mingled with wild talk of religious dogma and a general exaltation of Priapism at the expense, in particular, of Christianity, in which religion, however, he is undoubtedly a believer till the last (the pious will quote James ii. 19, and the infidel will observe that he died in an asylum) ; then the full swing of the tide catches him, the mysteries of death become more and more an obsession, and he is flung headlong into Sadism, Necrophilia,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"NOTES 59 all the maddest, fiercest vices that the mind of fiends ever brought up from the pit.

As Goethe wrote of him : “ They thought the master too Inclined to fuss and finick. The students’ anger grew To frenzy Paganinic.* They vowed they’d make him rue His work in Jena’s clinic.

Sattva.66—The Buddhists, denying an Atman or Soul (an idea of changeless, eternal, knowledge, being and bliss) represent the fictitious Ego of a man (or a dog) as a tem-porary agglomeration of particles. Reincar-nation only knocks off, as it were, some of the corners of the mass, so that for several births the Ego is constant within limits ; hence the possibility of the “magical memory.” The “Sattva” is this agglomeration.

It is true that evolution may bring us a moral sense of astonishing delicacy and beauty. But we are not there yet. A talented but debauched Irishman has composed the following, which I can deplore, but not refute, for this type of man is probably more prone to repro- duce his species than any other. He called it “Summa Spes.” I. Existence being sorrow, The cause of it deisre, A merry tune I borrow To light upon the lyre : If death destroy me quite, Then, I cannot lament it ; I’ve lived, kept life alight, And—damned if I repent it !

Let me die like a dog ; Die, and be done with it ! * Famous Adelphi villain. II. As far as reason goes, There’s hope for mortals yet : When nothing is that knows, What is there to regret ? Our consciousness depends On matter in the brain ; When that rots out, and ends, There ends the hour of pain. III. If we can trust to this, Why, dance and drink and revel ! Great scarlet mouths to kiss, And sorrow to the devil ! If pangs ataxic creep, Or gout, or stone, annoy us, Queen Morphia, grant thy sleep ! Let worms, the dears, enjoy us ! IV.

On that day I left Ceylon, where I had been for several months, practising Hindu meditations, and exposing the dishonesty of the Missionaries, in the intervals of big game shooting. The follow-ing day I wrote “Ascension Day,” and “Pente-cost” on the Sunday, sitting outside the dak-bangala at Madura. These original drafts were small as compared to the present poems.

Its original title was “Crowley-mas Day.” It was issued privately in Paris in January 1903. It and “Science and Buddhism” are added to complete the logical sequence from 1898 till now. All, however, has been repeatedly revised. Wherever there seemed a lacuna in the argument an insertion was made, till all appeared a perfect chrysolite. Most of this was done, while the weary hours of the summer (save the mark !) of 1902 rolled over Camp Misery and Camp Despair on the Chogo Ri Glacier, in those rare intervals when one’s preoccuption with lice, tinned food, malaria, insoaking water, general soreness, mental misery, and the everlasting snowstorm gave place to a momentary glimmer of any higher form of intelligence than that ever necessarily concentrated on the actual business of camp life. The rest, and the final revision, occupied a good deal of my time during the winter of 1902-1903. The MS. was accepted by the S. P. R.

The “fool” is He of the Tarot, to whom the number 0 is attached, to make the meaning patent to a child. “I insult your idol,” quoth the good missionary ; “ he is but of dead stone. He does not avenge himself. He does not punish me.” “I insult your god,” replied the Hindu ; “he is invisible. He does not avenge himself, nor punish me.” “My God will punish you when you die !” “So, when you die, will my idol punish you !” No earnest student of religion or draw poker should fail to commit this anecdote to memory. 767. Mr Chesterton.80—I must take this opportunity to protest against the charge brought by Mr. Chesterton against the English-men “who write philosophical essays on the splendour of Eastern thought.” If he confines his strictures to the translators of that well-known Eastern work the “Old Testament” I am with him ; any modern Biblical critic will tell him what I mean. It took a long time, too, for the missionaries (and Tommy Atkins) to discover that “Budd” was not a “great Gawd.” But then they did not want to, and in any case sympath and in-telligence are not precisely the most salient qualities in either soldiers or missionaries. But nothing is more absurd than to compare men like Sir W. Jones, Sir R. Burton, Von Hammer-Purgstall, Sir E. Arnold, Prof. Max Müuller, Me, Prof. Rhys Davis, Lane, and the rest of our illustrious Orientalists to the poor"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"NOTES 63 and ignorant Hindus whose letters occasionally delight the readers of the Sporting Times, such letters being usually written by public scribes for a few pice in the native bazaar. As to “Babus” (Babu, I may mention, is the equivalent to our “Mister,” and not the name of a savage tribe), Mr. Chesterton, from his Brixton Brahmaloka, may look forth and see that the “Babu” cannot understand Western ideas; but a distinguished civil servant in the Madras Presidency, second wrangler in a very good year, assured me that he had met a native whose mathematical knowledge was superior to that of the average senior wrangler, and that he had met several others who approached that standard. His specific attack on Madame Blavatsky is equally unjust, as many natives, not theoso-phists, have spoken to me of her in the highest terms. “Honest Hindus” cannot be ex- pected to think as Mr. Chesterton deems likely, as he is unfortunately himself a Western, and in the same quagmire of mis-apprehension as Prof. Max Müller and the rest. Madame Blavatsky’s work was to remind the Hindus of the excellence of their own shastras,* to show that some Westerns held identical ideas, and thus to countermine the dishonest representations of the mission-aries. I am sufficiently well known as a bitter opponent of “Theosophy” to risk nothing in making these remarks. I trust that the sense of public duty which inspires these strictures will not be taken as incompatible with the gratitude I owe to him for his exceedingly sympathetic and dispassionate review of my “Soul of Osiris.” I would counsel him, however, to leave alone the Brixton Chapel, and to “work up from his appreciation of the ‘Soul of Osiris’ to that loftier and wider work of the human imagina-tion, the appreciation of the Sporting Times !” ——— Mr Chesterton thinks it funny that I should call upon “Shu.” Has he forgotten that the Christian God may be most suitably invoked by the name “Yah” ? I should be sorry if God were to mistake his religious enthusiasms for the derisive ribaldry of the London “gamin.” Similar remarks apply to “El” and other Hebrai-christian deities. This note is hardly intelligible without the review referred to. I therefore reprint the * Sacred Books. portion thereof which is germane to my matter from the Daily News, June 18, 1901 :— To the side of a mind concerned with idle merri-ment (sic !) there is certainly something a little funny in Mr. Crowley’s passionate devotion to deities who bear such names as Mout and Nuit, and Ra and Shu, and Hormakhou. They do no seem to the English mind to lend themselves to pious exhilara-tion. Mr Crowley says in the same poem : The burden is too hard to bear, I took too adamant a cross ; This sackcloth rends my soul to wear, My self-denial is as dross. O, Shu, that holdest up the sky, Holy up thy servant, lest he die ! We have all possible respect for Mr. Crowley’s re-ligious symbols, and we do not object to his calling upon Shu at any hour of the night. Only it would be unreasonable of him to complain if his religious exercises were generally mistaken for an effort to drive away cats. ——— Moreover, the poets of Mr. Crowley’s school have, among all their merits, some genuine intellectual dangers from this tendency to import religions, this free trade in gods. That all creeds are significant and all gods divine we willingly agree. But this is rather a reason for being content with our own than for attempting to steal other people’s. That affecta-tion in many modern mystics of adopting an Oriental civilisation and mode of thought must cause much harmless merriment among the actual Orientals. The notion that a turban and a few vows will make an Englishman a Hindu is quite on a par with the idea that a black hat and an Oxford degree will make a Hindu an Englishman. We wonder whether our Buddhistic philosophers have ever read a florid letter in Baboo English. We suspect that the said type of document is in reality exceedingly like the philosophic essays written by Englishmen about the splendour of Eastern thought. Sometimes European mystics deserve something worse than mere laughter at the hands (sic !) or Orientals. If there was one person whom honest Hindus would ever have been justified in tearing to pieces it was Madame Blavatsky. ——— That our world-worn men of art should believe for a moment that moral salvation is possible and supremely important is an unmixed benefit. But to believe for a moment that it is to be found by going to particular places or reading particular books or joining particular socieites is to make for the thou-sandth time the mistake that is at once materialism and superstition. If Mr. Crowley and the new mystics think for one moment that an Egyptian desert is more mystic than an English meadow, that a palm tree is more poetic than a Sussex beech, that a broken temple of Osiris is more super-natural than a Baptist chapel in Brixton, then they"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE SWORD OF SONG 64 are sectarians, and only sectarians of no more value to humanity than those who think that the English soil is the only soil worth defending, and the Baptist chapel the only chapel worth of worship (sic). But Mr. Crowley is a strong and genuine poet, and we have little doubt that he will work up from his appreciation of the Temple of Osiris to that loftier and wider work of the human imagination, the appreciation of the Brixton chapel.

Truly, since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah,† and only adolescence can cure us, we are only too liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood, to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics, to regard them both on the same level, as interesting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and as nothing more. Even when we learn that the Bible, by a * This essay forms the introduction an edition of the “Goetia” of King Solomon † “A Thousand and One Nights,” commonly called “Arabian Nights.” profound and minute study of the text, may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance, we are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume, even if we are the lucky holders of Burton’s veritable edition. To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its proper place once more. I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all “magical” phenomena ; if they are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily life; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence of some cause.* Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art? Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer: “That cause lies in your brain.” English children are taught (pace the Education Act) that the Universe lies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akasa, which is the same thing. Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that the phenomenal Uni-verse is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under Hindu Gurus, are *This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to its extreme, against the Advaitist theories.—A.C."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"NOTES 65 told, that by Akasa is mean the Chitakasa. The Chitakasa is situated in the “Third Eye,” i.e., in the brain. By assuming higher dimen-sions of space, we can assimilate this face to Realism; but we have no need to take so much trouble. This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions are dependent on changes in the brain,* we must include illusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as “realities” are, in the class of “phenomena dependent on brain-changes.” Magical phenomna, however, come under a special sub-class, since they are willed, and their cause is the series of “real” phenomena called the operations of ceremonial Magic. These consist of: (1) Sight. The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, imple- ments, etc. (2) Sound.  The invocations. (3) Smell.  The perfumes. (4) Taste.  The Sacraments. (5) Touch.  As under (1) (6) Mind.  The combination of all these and reflection on their significance. These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence their summary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into the apparently phenomenal world is therefore unusual. Herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonial magic,† and I conceive that the apology is ample, so far as the “effects” refer only to those phenomena which appear to the magician himself, the appearance of the spirit, his conversation, possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on the one hand, and death or madness on the other. But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances ? Say you so ? I can, and will. The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer’s * Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weiss-man). Consciousness is a function of the brain (Huxley).—A. C. † Apart from its value in obtaining one-pointedness. On this subject consult tycarb, infra.—A.

(Establish-ment of functions relative to the subtle world). (b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit). (c) Control over one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.) The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to control a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit’s name. I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking. If, then, I say, with Solomon: “The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,” what I mean is: “Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be stimulated and developed by following out the process called ‘The Invocation of Cimieries.’ ” And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is independent of any objective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can only suspend judgement, pending a proper and methodical investigation of the facts alleged. Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we can (1) obtain information; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the voices of nature; (4) obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken these five powers at random; considerations of space forbid me to explain all. (1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness. (2) Here we come to an interestin fact. It is curious to note the contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter are disguises for sublime truths. “To destroy our enemies” is to realise the illusion of duality, to excite compassion. (Ah ! Mr. Waite,* the world of Magic is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.) (3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals he has studied long.

So for all the other phenomena. There is no effect which is truly and necessarily miraculous.

How rare will be appreciated when I say that no copy either of original or translation occurs in the British Museum ; the only known copy, that in the Bodleian, is concealed by the pre-Adamite system of cataloguing in vogue at that hoary but unvenerable institution.

The bulk of these poems was written when I was an Advaitist, incredible as the retrospect now appears. My revision has borne Buddhist fruits, but some of the Advaita blossom is left. Look, for example, at the dreadfully Papistical tendency of my celebrated essay : AFTER AGNOSTICISM Allow me to introduce myself as the original Irishman whose first question on landing at New York was, “Is there a Government in this country?” and on being told “Yes,” instantly replied, “Then I’m agin it.” For after some years of consistent Agnosticism, being at last asked to contribute to an Agnostic organ, for the life of me I can think of nothing better than to attack my hosts! Insidious cuckoo! Ungrateful Banyan! My shame drives me to Semetic analogy, and I sadly reflect that if I had been Balaam, I should not have needed an ass other than myself to tell me to do the precise contrary of what is expected of me. For this is my position; while the postulate of Agnosticism are in one sense eternal, I believe that the conclusions of Agnosticism are daily to be pushed back. We know our ignorance; with that fact we are twitted by those who do not know enough to understand"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE SWORD OF SONG 68 even what we mean when we say so; but the limits of knowledge, slowly receding, yet never so far as to permit us to unveil the awful and impenetrable adytum of consciousness, or that of matter, must one day be suddenly widened by the forging of a new weapon. Huxley and Tyndall have prophesied this before I was born; sometimes in vague language, once or twice clearly enough; to me it is a source of the utmost concern that their successors should not always see eye to eye with them in this respect. Professor Ray Lankester, in crushing the unhappy theists of the recent Times contro-versy, does not hesitate to say that Science can never throw any light on certain mysteries. Even the theist is justified in retorting that Science, if this be so, may as well be dis- carded ; for these are problems which must ever intrude upon the human mind—upon the mind of the scientist most of all. To dismiss them by an act of will is at once heroic and puerile : courage is as necessary to progress as any quality that we possess ; and as courage is in either case required, the courage of ignorance (necessarily sterile, though wanted badly enough when our garden was choked by theological weeds) is less desirable than the courage which embarks on the always desperate philosophical problem. Time and again, in the history of Science, a period has arrived when, gorged with facts, she has sunk into a lethargy of reflection accompanied by appalling nightmares in the shape of impossible theories. Such a night-mare now rides us ; once again philosophy has said its last word, and arrived at a dead-lock. Aristotle, in reducing to the fundamental contradictions-in-terms which they involve the figments of the Pythagoreans, the Eleatics, the Platonists, the Pyrrhonists ; Kant, in his reductio ad absurdam of the Thomists, the Scotists, the Wolffians,—all the warring brood, alike only in the inability to reconcile the ultimate antimonies of a cosmogony only grosser for its pinchbeck spirituality ; have, I take it, found their modern parallel in the ghastly laughter of Herbert Spencer, as fleshed upon the corpses of Berkeley and the Idealists from Fichte and Hartman to Lotze and Tren-delenburg he drives the reeking fangs of his im-agination into the palpitating vitals of his own grim masterpiece of reconcilement, self-deluded and yet self-conscious of its own delusion. History affirms that such a deadlock is invariably the prelude to a new enlightenment: by such steps we have advanced, by such we shall advance. The “horror of great darkness” which is scepticism must ever be broken by some heroic master-soul, intolerant of the cosmic agony. We then await his dawn. May I go one step further, and lift up my voice and prophesy? I would indicate the direction in which this darkness must break. Evolutionists will remember that nature cannot rest. Nor can society. Still less the brain of man. “ Audax omnia perpeti Gens human ruit per vetitum nefas.”* We have destroyed the meaning of vetitum nefas and are in no fear of an imaginary cohort of ills and terrors. Having perfected one weapon, reason, and found it destructive to all falsehood, we have been (some of us) a little apt to go out to fight with no other weapon. “FitzJames’s blade was sword and shield,”† and that served him against the murderous bludgeon-sword of the ruffianly Highlander he happened to meet; but he would have fared ill had he called a Western Sheriff a liar, or gone off Boer-sticking on Spion Kop. Reason has done its utmost; theory has glutted us, and the motion of the ship is a little trying; mixed metaphore—excellent in a short essay like this—is no panacea for all mental infirmities; we must seek another guide. All the facts science has so busily collected, varied as they seem to be, are in reality all of the same kind. If we are to have one salient fact, a fact for a real advance, it must be a fact of a different order. Have we such a fact to hand? We have. First, what do we mean by a fact of a different order? Let me take and example; the most impossible being the best for our purpose. The Spiritualists, let us suppose, go mad and begin to talk sense. (I can only imagine that such would be the result.) All their “facts” are proved. We prove a world of spirits, the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, etc. But, with all that, we are not really one step advanced into the heart of the inquiry which lies at the heart of philosophy, “What is anything?” I see a cat. Dr. Johnson says it is a cat. Berkeley says it is a group of sensations. Cankaracharya says it is an illusion, an incarnation, or God, according to the hat he has got on, and is talking through. Spencer says it is a mode of the Unknow-able. But none of them seriously doubt the fact that I exist; that a cat exists; that one sees the other, All—bar Johnson—hint—but oh! how dimly!—at what I now know to be—true?—no, not necesarily true, but nearer the truth. Huxley goes deeper in his demolition of Des-cartes. With him, “I see a cat,” proves “some- * Horace, Odes, I. 3. † Scott, The Lady of the Lake."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"NOTES 69 thing called consciousness exists.” He denies the assertion of duality: he has no datum to assert the denial of duality. I have. Consciousness, as we know it, has one essential quality: the opposition of subject and object. Reason has attacked this and secured that complete and barren victory of convincing without producing conviction.* It has one quality apparently not essential, that of ex-ceeding impermanence. If we examine what we call steady thought, we shall find that its rate of change is in reality inconceivably swift. To consider it, to watch it, is beweildering, and to some people becomes intensely terrifying. It is as if the solid earth were suddenly swept away from under one, and there were some dread awakening in outer space amid the rush of incessant meteors—lost in the void. All this is old knowledge; but who has taken steps to alter it ? The answer is forbidding: truth compels me to say, the mystics of all lands. Their endeavour has been to slow the rate of change ; their methods perfect quietude of body and mind, produce in varied and too often vicious ways. Regularisation of the breathing is the best known formula. Their results are contemptible, we must admit ; but only so because empirical. An unwarranted reverence has overlaid the watchfulness which science would have enjoined, and the result is muck and misery, the wreck of a noble study. But what is the one fact on which all agree? The one fact whose knowledge has been since reliigon began the all-sufficient passport to their doubtfully-desirable company? This: that “I see a cat” is not only an unwarrantable assumption but a lie ; that the duality of consciousness ceases suddenly, once the rate of change has been sufficiently slowed down, so that, even for a few seconds, the rela-tion of subject and object remains impregnable. It is a circumstance of little interest to the present essayist that this annihilation of duality is associated with intense and passionless peace and delight; the fact has been a bribe to the unwary, a bait for the charlatan, a hindrance to the philosopher; let us discard it.† * Hume, and Kant in the “Prolegomena,” discuss this phenomenon unsatisfactorily.—A. C. † It is this rapture which has ever been the bond between mystics of all shades; and the obstacle to any accurate observation of the phenomenon, its true causes, and so on. This must always be a stumbling-block to more impressionable minds; but there is no doubt as to the fact—it is a fact—and its present isolation is to be utterly deplored. May I entreat men of Science to conquer the prejudices natural to them when the justly despised ideas of mysticism are mentioned, and to attack the problem ab initio on the severely critical and austerely arduous lines which have distinguished their labours in other fields?—A. C. More, though the establishment of this new estate of consciousness seems to open the door to a new world, a world where the axioms of Euclid may be absurd, and the propositions of Keynes* untenable, let us not fall into the error of the mystics, by supposin that in this world is necessarily a final truth, or even a certain and definite gain of knowledge. But that a field for research is opened up no sane man may doubt. Nor may one question that the very first fact is of a nature disruptive of difficulty philosophical and reasonalbe; since the phenomenon does not invoke the assent of the reasoning faculty. The arguments which reason may bring to bear about it are self-destructive; reason has given consciousness the lie, but consciousness survives and smiles. Reason is a part of consciousness and can never be greater than the whole; this Spencer sees; but reason is not even any part of this new consciousness (which I, and many others, have too rarely achieved) and therefore can never touch it: this I see, and this will I hope be patent to those ardent and spiritually-minded agnostics of whom Huxley and Tyndall are for all history-time the prototypes. Know or doubt! is the alternative of the highwayman Huxley; “Believe” is not to be admitted; this is fundamental; in this agnosticism can never change; this must ever command our moral as well as our intellectual assent. But I assert my strong conviction that ere long we shall have done enough of what is after all the schoolmaster work of correcting the inky and ill-spelt exercises of the theological dunces in that great class-room, the world; and found a little peace—while they play—in the intimate solitude of the laboratory and the passionless rapture of research—research into those very mysteries of nature which our dunces have solved by a rule of thumb; determining the nature of a bee by stamping on it, and shouting “bee”; while we patiently set to work with microscopes, and say nothing till be know, nor more than need be when we do. But I am myself found guilty of this rôle of schoolmaster : I will now therefore shut the doors and retire again into the laboratory where my true life lies. 403, 405. Reason and concentration.45—The results of reasoning are always assailable : those of concentration are vivid and certain, since they are directly presented to conscious-ness. And they are more certain than con-sciousness itself, since one who has experienced them may, with consciousness, doubt con-sciousness, but can in no state doubt them. 412.

The condition was that the Almighty should have the odds of an unusually long line,—the place was really a swift stream, just debouching into a lake—and of an unusual slowness of drawing in the cast. But what does any miracle prove ? If the Affaire Cana were proved to me, I should merely record the facts : Water may under certain unknown conditions become wine. It is a pity that the owner of the secret remains silent, and entirely lamentable that he should attempt to deduce from his scientific knowledge cosmic theories which have nothing whatever to do with it. Suppose Edison, having perfected the phono-graph, had said, “I alone can make dumb things speak ; argal, I am God.” What would the world have said if telegraphy had been ex-ploited for miracle-mongering purposes ? Are these miracles less or greater than those of the Gospels ? Before we accept Mrs. Piper,* we want to know most exactly the conditions of the ex-periment, and to have some guarantee of the reliability of the witnesses. At Cana of Galilee the conditions of the transformation are not stated—save that they give loopholes innumerable for chicanery—and the witnesses are all drunk ! (thou hast kept the good wine till now: i.e. till men have well drunk—Greek, mequstwsi, are well drunk). Am I to belive this, and a glaring non sequitur as to Christ’s deity, on the evidence, not even of the inebriated eye-witnesses, but of MSS. of doubtful authorship and date, bear- ing all the ear-marks of dishonesty. For we must not forget that the absurdities of to-day were most cunning proofs for the poor folk of seventeen centuries ago. Talking of fish-stories, read John xxi. 1-6 * A twentieth century medium. or Luke V. 1-7 (comparisons are odious). But once I met a man by a lake and told him that I had toiled all the morning and had caught nothing, and he advised me to try the other side of the lake ; and I caught many fish. But I knew not that it was the Lord. In Australia they were praying for rain in the churches. The Sydney Bulletin very sensibly pointed out how much more reverent and practical it would be, if, instead of con-stantly worrying the Almighty about trifles, they would pray once and for all for a big range of mountains in Central Australia, which would of course supply rain automatically. No new act of creation would be necessary ; faith, we are expressly told, can remove mountains, and there is ice and snow and especially moraine on and about the Baltoro Glacier to build a very fine range ; we could well have spared it this last summer. 579.

IN presenting this theory of the Universe to the world, I have but one hope of making any profound impression, viz.—that my theory has the merit of explaining the divergences between the three great forms of religion now existing in the world—Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, and of adapting them to ontological science by conclusions not mystical but mathematical. Of Mohamme-dism I shall not now treat, as, in whatever light we may decide to regard it (and its esoteric schools are often orthodox), in any case it must fall under one of the three heads of Nihilism, Advaitism, and Dvaitism. Taking the ordinary hypothesis of the universe, that of its infinity, or at any rate that of the infinity of God, or of the infinity of some substance or idea actually existing, we first come to the question of the possi-bility of the co-existence of God and man. The Christians, in the category of the ex-istent, enumerate among other things, whose consideration we may discard for the purposes of this argument, God, an infinite being; man; Satan and his angels; man certainly, Satan presumably, finite beings. These are not aspects of one being, but separate and even antagonistic existences. All are equally real; we cannot accept mystics of the type of Caird as being orthodox exponents of the religion of Christ. The Hindus enumerate Brahm, infinite in all dimensions and directions—indistinguish-able from the Pleroma of the Gnostics—and Maya, illusion. This is in a sense the ante-thesis of noumenon and phenomenon, nou-menon being negated of all predicates until it becomes almost extinguished in the Nichts under the title of the Alles. (Cf. Max Müller on the metaphysical Nirvana, in his Dham-mapada, Introductory Essay.) The Bud-dhists express no opinion. Let us consider the force-quality in the existences conceived of by those two religions respectively, remembering that the God of the Christian is infinite, and yet discussing the alternative if we could suppose him to be a finite God. In any equilibrated system of forces, we may sum and represent them as a triangle or series of triangles which again resolve into one. In any moving system, if the resultant motion be applied in a contrary direction, the equilibrium can also thus be represented. And if any one of the original forces in such a system may be considered, that one is equal to the resultant of the re-mainder. Let x, the purpose of the universe, be the resultant of the forces G, S, and M (God, Satan, and Man). Then M is also the resultant of G, S, and -x. So that we can regard either of our forces as supreme, and there is no reason for worshipping one rather that the other. All are finite. This argument the Christians clearly see: hence the development of God from the petty 1902 tycarb AN ESSAY IN ONTOLOGY WITH SOME REMARKS ON CEREMONIAL MAGIC"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"tycarb 74 joss of Genesis to the intangible, but self-contradictory spectre of to-day. But if G be infinite, the other forces can have no possible effect on it. As Whewell says, in the strange accident by which he anticipates the metre of In Memoriam: “No force on earth, however great, can stretch a cord, however fine, into a horizontal line that shall be absolutely straight.” The definition of God as infinite therefore denies man implicitly; while if he be finite, there is an end of the usual Christian reasons for worship, though I daresay I could myself discover some reasonably good ones. [I hardly expect to be asked, somehow.] The resulting equilibrium of God and man, destructive of worship, is of course absurd. We must reject it, unless we want to fall into Positivism, Materialism, or something of the sort. But if, then, we call God infinite, how are we to regard man, and Satan? (the latter, at the very least, surely no integral part of him). The fallacy lies not in my demonstration (which is also that of ortho-doxy) that a finite God is absurd, but in the assumption that man has any real force.1 In our mechanical system (as I have hinted above), if one of the forces be infinite, the others, however great, are both relatively and absolutely nothing. In any category, infinity excludes finity, unless that finity be an identical part of that infinity. In the category of existing things, space being infinite, for on that hypothesis we are still working, either matter fills or does not fill it. If the former, matter is infinitely great; if the latter, infinitely small. Whether the matter-universe be 1010000 light-years in diameter or half a mile makes no difference; it is infinitely small—in effect, Nothing. The unmathematical illusion that it does exist is what the Hindus call Maya. If, on the other hand, the matter-universe is infinite, Brahm and God are crowded out, and the possibility of religion is equally excluded. 1 Lully, Descartes, Spinoza, Schelling. See their works. We may now shift our objective. The Hindus cannot account intelligibly, though they try hard, for Maya, the cause of all suffering. Their position is radically weak, but at least we may say for them that they have tried to square their religion with their common sense. The Christians, on the other hand, though they saw whither the Manichean Heresy1 must lead, and crushed it, have not officially admitted the precisely similar conclusion with regard to man, and denied the existence of the human soul as distinct from the divine soul. Trismegistus, Iamblichus, Porphyry, Boehme, and the mystics generally have of course substantially done so, though occa-sionally with rather inexplicable reservations, similar to those made in some cases by the Vedantists themselves. Man then being disproved, God the Person disappears for ever, and becomes Atman, Pleroma, Ain Soph, what name you will, infinite in all directions and in all categories —to deny one is to destroy the entire argu-ment and throw us back on to our old Dvaitistic bases. I entirely sympathise with my unhappy friend Rev. Mansel, B.D.,2 in his piteous and pitiful plaints against the logical results of the Advaitist School. But, on his basal hypothesis of an infinite God, infinite space, time, and so on, no other conclusion is possible. Dean Mansel is found in the im-possible position of one who will neither give up his premisses nor dispute the validity of his logical processes, but who shrinks in horror from the inevitable conclusion; he supposes there must be something wrong somewhere, and concludes that the sole use of reason is to discover its own inferiority to faith. As Deussen3 well points out, faith in the Christian sense merely amounts to 1 The conception of Satan as a positive evil force; the lower triangle of the Hexagram. 2 Encyclopedia Britannica, Art.

But though, always on the original hypo-thesis of the infinity of space, &c., the Ad-vaitist position of the Vedantists and the great Germans is unassailable, yet on practical grounds the Dvaitists have all the advantage. Fichte and the others exhaust themselves trying to turn the simple and obvious posi-tion that: “If the Ego alone exists, where is any place, not only for morals and religion, which we can very well do without, but for the most essential and continuous acts of life? Why should an infinite Ego fill a non-existent body with imaginary food cooked in thought only over an illusionary fire by a cook who is not there ? Why should infinite power use such finite means, and very often fail even then?” What is the sum total of the Vedantist position ? “‘I’ am an illusion, externally. In reality, the true ‘I’ am the Infinite, and if the illusionary ‘I’ could only realise Who ‘I’ really am, how very happy we should all be !” And here we have Karma, rebirth, all the mighty laws of nature operat-ing nowhere in nothing ! There is no room for worship or for morality in the Advaitist system. All the specious pleas of the Bhagavad-Gita, and the ethical works of Western Advaitist philosophers, are more or less consciously confusion of thought. But no subtlety can turn the practical argument; the grinning mouths of the Dvaitist guns keep the fort of Ethics, and warn metaphysics to keep off the rather green grass of religion. That its apologists should have devoted so much time, thought, scholarship and in- genuity to this question is the best proof of the fatuity of the Advaita position. There is then a flaw somewhere. I boldly take up the glove against all previous wisdom, 1 Or, as the Sunday-school boy said: “Faith is the power of believing what we know to be untrue.” I quote Deussen with the more pleasure, because it is about the only sentence in all his writings with which I am in accord .—A.C. revert to the most elementary ideas of canni-bal savages, challenge all the most vital premisses and axiomata that have passed current coin with philosophy for centuries, and present my theory. I clearly foresee the one difficulty, and will discuss it in advance. If my conclusions on this point are not accepted, we may at once get back to our previous irritable agnosti-cism, and look for our Messiah elsewhere. But if we can see together on this one point, I think things will go fairly smoothly after-wards. Consider1 Darkness ! Can we philosophi-cally or actually regard as different the dark-ness produced by interference of light and that existing in the mere absence of light ? Is Unity really identical with .9 recurring? Do we not mean different things when we speak respectively of 2 sine 60° and of 3? Charcoal and diamond are obviously dif-ferent in the categories of colour, crystallisa-tion, hardness, and so on; but are they not really so even in that of existence ? The third example is to my mind the best. 2 sine 60° and 3 are unreal and therefore never conceivable, at least to the present constitution of our human intelligences. Worked out, neither has meaning; un-worked, both have meaning, and that a different meaning in one case and the other. We have thus two terms, both unreal, both inconceivable, yet both representing intelligible and diverse ideas to our minds (and this is the point !) though identical in reality and convertible by a process of reason which simulates or replaces that apprehen-sion which we can never (one may suppose) attain to. Let us apply this idea to the Beginning of all things, about which the Christians lie frankly, the Hindus prevaricate, and the 1 Ratiocination may perhaps not take us far.

The Qabalists explain the “First Cause”1 by the phrase: “From 0 to 1, as the circle opening out into the line.” The Christian dogma is really identical, for both conceive of a previous and eternally existing God, though the Qabalists hedge by describing this latent Deity as “Not.” Later com-mentators, notably the illustrious2 Mac-Gregor-Mathers, have explained this Not as “negatively-existing.” Profound as is my respect for the intellectual and spiritual attainments of him whom I am proud to have been permitted to call my master,2 I am bound to express my view that when the Qabalists said Not, they meant Not, and nothing else. In fact, I really claim to have re-discovered the long-lost and central Arcanum of those divine philosophers. I have no serious objection to a finite god, or gods, distinct from men and things. In fact, personally, I believe in them all, and admit them to possess inconceivable though not infinite power. The Buddhists admit the existence of Maha-Brahma, but his power and knowledge are limited; and his agelong day must end. I find evidence everywhere, even in our garbled and mutilated version of the Hebrew Scriptures, that Jehovah’s power was limited in all sorts of ways. At the Fall, for instance, Tetragrammaton Elohim has to summon his angels hastily to guard the Tree of Life, lest he should be proved a liar. For had it occurred to Adam to eat of that Tree before their transgression was discovered, or had the Serpent been aware of its properties, Adam would indeed have lived and not died. So that a mere accident saved the remnants of the already be-smirched reputation of the Hebrew tribal Fetich. 1 An expression they carefully avoid using. — A.C. 2 I retain this sly joke from the first edition. When Buddha was asked how things came to be, he took refuge in silence, which his disciples very conveniently interpreted as meaning that the question tended not to edification. I take it that the Buddha (ignorant, doubt-less, of algebra) had sufficiently studied philosophy and possessed enough worldly wisdom to be well aware that any system he might promulgate would be instantly attacked and annihilated by the acumen of his numer-ous and versatile opponents. Such teaching as he gave on the point may be summed up as follows. “Whence, whither, why, we know not; but we do know that we are here, that we dislike being here, that there is a way out of the whole loathsome affair—let us make haste and take it!” I am not so retiring in disposition; I per-sist in my inquiries, and at last the appalling question is answered, and the past ceases to intrude its problems upon my mind. Here you are! Three shies a penny! Change all bad arguments. I ASSERT THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE QABALISTIC ZERO. When we say that the Cosmos sprang from 0, what kind of 0 do we mean ? By 0 in the ordinary sense of the term we mean “absence of extension in any of the categories.” When I say “No cat has two tails,” I do not mean, as the old fallacy runs, that “Absence-of-cat possesses two tails” ; but that “In the category of two-tailed things, there is no extension of cat.” Nothingness is that about which no posi-tive proposition is valid. We cannot truly affirm: “Nothingness is green, or heavy, or sweet.” Let us call time, space, being, heaviness, hunger, the categories.1 If a man be heavy 1 I cannot here discuss the propriety of representing the categories as dimensions. It will be obvious to any student of the integral calculus, or to any one who appreciates the geometrical significance of the term x4.—A.C."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"AN ESSAY IN ONTOLOGY 77 and hungry, he is extended in all these, besides, of course, many more. But let us suppose that these five are all. Call the man X; his formula is then Xt+s+b+h+h. If he now eat; he will cease to be extended in hunger; if he be cut off from time and gravitation as well, he will now be represented by the formula Xs+b. Should he cease to occupy space and to exist, his formula would then be X0. This expression is equal to 1; whatever X may represent, if it be raised to the power of 0 (this meaning mathematically “if it be extended in no dimension or category”), the result is Unity, and the unknown factor X is eliminated. This is the Advaitist idea of the future of man; his personality, bereft of all qualities, disappears and is lost, while in its place arises the impersonal Unity, The Pleroma, Parabrahma, or the Allah of the Unity-adoring followers of Mohammed. (To the Musulman fakir, Allah is by no means a personal God.) Unity is thus unaffected, whether or no it be extended in any of the categories. But we have already agreed to look to 0 for the Uncaused. Now if there was in truth 0 “before the beginning of years,” THAT 0 WAS EX-TENDED IN NONE OF THE CATE-GORIES, FOR THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO CATEGORIES IN WHICH IT COULD EXTEND! If our 0 was the ordinary 0 of mathematics, there was not truly absolute 0, for 0 is, as I have shown, de-pendent on the idea of categories. If these existed, then the whole question is merely thrown back; we must reach a state in which this 0 is absolute. Not only must we get rid of all subjects, but of all predi- cates. By 0 (in mathematics) we really mean 0n, where n is the final term of a natural scale of dimensions, categories, or predicates. Our Cosmic Egg, then, from which the present universe arose, was Nothingness, extended in no categories, or graphically, 00. This expression is in its present form meaningless. Let us dis- cover its value by a simple mathematical process! 000001111==−Multiply by1=nn Then 00011nn×=×∞. Now the multiplying of the infinitely great by the infinitely small results in SOME UNKNOWN FINITE NUMBER EX-TENDED IN AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF CATEGORIES. It happened, when this our Great Inversion took place, from the essence of all nothingness to finity ex-tended in innumerable categories, that an incalculably vast system was produced. Merely by chance, chance in the truest sense of the term, we are found with gods, men, stars, planets, devils, colours, forces, and all the materials of the Cosmos: and with time, space, and causality, the conditions limiting and involving them all.1 Remember that it is not true to say that our 00 existed; nor that it did not exist. The idea of existence was just as much un-formulated as that of toasted cheese. But 00 is a finite expression, or has a finite phase, and our universe is a finite universe ; its categories are themselves finite, and the expression “infinite space” is a contradiction in terms. The idea of an absolute and infinite2 God is relegated to the limbo of all similar idle and pernicious perversions of truth. Infinity remains, but only as a mathe-matical conception as impossible in nature as the square root of -1. Against all this mathematical, or semi-mathematical, reason-ing, it may doubtless be objected that our 1 Compare and contrast this doctrine with that of Herbert Spencer (“First Principles,” Pt. I.), and see my “Science and Buddhism” for a full discussion of the difference involved. —A. C. 2 If by “infinitely great” we only mean “indefinitely great,” as a mathematician would perhaps tell us, we of course begin at the very point I am aiming at, viz., Ecrasez l’Infini. —A.C."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"tycarb 78 whole system of numbers, and of manipulating them, is merely a series of conventions. When I say that the square root of three is unreal, I know quite well that it is only so in relation to the series 1, 2, 3, &c., and that this series is equally unreal if I make 3, p, 503 the members of a ternary scale. But this, theoretically true, is practically absurd. If I mean “the number of a, b, and c,” it does not matter if I write 3 or 503 ; the idea is a definite one ; and it is the funda-mental ideas of consciousness of which we are treating, and to which we are compelled to refer everything, whether proximately or ultimately. So also my equation, fantastic as it may seem, has a perfect and absolute parallel in logic. Thus: let us convert twice the pro-position “some books are on the table.” By negativing both terms we get “Absence- of-book is not on the table,” which is precisely my equation backwards, and a thinkable thing. To reverse the process, what do I mean when I say “some pigs, but not the black pig, are not in the sty” ? I imply that the black pig is in the sty. All I have done is to represent the con-version as a change, rather than as merely another way of expressing the same thing. And “change” is really not my meaning either; for change, to our minds, involves the idea of time. But the whole thing is inconceivable—to ratiocination, though not to thought. Note well too that if I say “Absence-of-books is not on the table,” I cannot convert it only “All books are on the table” but only to “some books are on the table.” The proposition is an “I” and not an “A” proposition. It is the Advaita blunder to make it so; and many a schoolboy has fed off the mantelpiece for less. There is yet another proof—the proof by exclusion. I have shown, and meta-physicians practically admit, the falsity alike of Dvaitism and Advaitism. The third, the only remaining theory, this theory, must, however antecedently impro- bable, however difficult to assimilate, be true.1 “My friend, my young friend,” I think I hear some Christian cleric say, with an air of profound wisdom, not untinged with pity, condescending to pose beardless and brainless impertinence: “where is the Cause for this truly remarkable change?” That is exactly where the theory rears to heaven its stoutest bastion! There is not, and could not be, any cause. Had 00 been extended in causality, no change could have taken place.2 Here then, are we, finite beings in a finite universe, time, space, and causality them-selves finite (inconceivable as it may seem) with our individuality, and all the “ill-usions” of the Advaitists, just as real as they practically are to our normal consciousness. As Schopenhauer, following Buddha, points out, suffering is a necessary condition of this existence.3 The war of the contend-ing forces as they grind themselves down to the final resultant must cause endless agony. We may one day be able to transform the categories of emotion as certainly and easily as we now transform the categories of force, so that in a few years Chicago may be im-porting suffering in the raw state and turning it into tinned salmon: but at present the reverse process is alone practicable. How, then, shall we escape? Can we expect the entire universe to resolve itself back into the phase of 00 ? Surely not. In the first place there is no reason why the whole should do so; xyis just as convertible as x. But worse, the category of causality has already been formed, and its inertia is 1 I may remark that the distinction between this theory and the normal one of the Immanence of the Universe, is trivial, perhaps even verbal only. Its advantage, however, is that, by hypostatising nothing, we avoid the necessity of any explanation. How did nothing come to be ? is a question which requires no answer. 2 See the Questions of King Milinda, vol. ii. p. 103. 3 See also Huxley, “Evolution and Ethics.”"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"AN ESSAY IN ONTOLOGY 79 sufficient to oppose a most serious stumbling-block to so gigantic a process. The task before us is consequently of a ter-rible nature. It is easy to let things slide, to grin and bear it in fact, until everything is merged in the ultimate unity, which may or may not be decently tolerable. But while we wait? There now arises the question of freewill. Causality is probably not fully extended in its own category,1 a circumstance which gives room for a fractional amount of freewill. If this be not so, it matters little; for if I find myself in a good state, that merely proves that my destiny took me there. We are, as Herbert Spencer observes, self-deluded with the idea of freewill; but if this be so, nothing matters at all. If, however, Herbert Spencer is mistaken (unlikely as it must ap-pear), then our reason is valid, and we should seek out the right path and pursue it. The question therefore need not trouble us at all. Here then we see the use of morals and of religion, and all the rest of the bag of tricks. All these are methods, bad or good, for extricating ourselves from the universe. Closely connected with this question is that of the will of God. People argue that an Infi-nite intelligence must have been at work on this cosmos. I reply No ! There is no intelligence at work worthy of the name. The Laws of Nature may be generalised in one—the Law of Inertia. Everything moves in the direction determined by the path of least resistance ; species arise, develop, and die as their collec-tive inertia determines; to this Law there is no exception but the doubtful one of Free-will; the Law of Destiny itself is formally and really identical with it.2 1 Causality is itself a secondary, and in its limitation as applied to volition, an inconceiv-able idea. H. Spencer, op. cit. This con-sideration alone should add great weight to the agnostic, and à fortiori to the Buddhist, position. 2 See H. Spencer, “First Principles,” “The Knowable,” for a fair summary of the facts under-lying this generalisation; which indeed he comes within an ace of making in so many words. It may be observed that this law is nearly if not quite axiomatic, its contrary being enormously difficult if not impossible to formulate mentally. As to an infinite intelligence, all philosophers of any standing are agreed that all-love and all-power are incompatible. The existence of the universe is a standing proof of this. The Deist needs the Optimist to keep him company; over their firesides all goes well, but it is a sad shipwreck they suffer on emerging into the cold world. This is why those who seek to buttress up religion are so anxious to prove that the universe has no real existence, or only a temporary and relatively unimportant one; the result is of course the usual self-destruc-tive Advaitist muddle. The precepts of morality and religion are thus of use, of vital use to us, in restraining the more violent forces alike of nature and of man. For unless law and order prevail, we have not the necessary quiet and re-sources for investigating, and learning to bring under our control, all the divergent phenomena of our prison, a work which we undertake that at last we may be able to break down the walls, and find that freedom which an inconsiderate Inversion has denied. The mystical precepts of pseudo-Zoroaster, Buddha, Çankaracharya, pseudo-Christ and the rest, are for advanced students only, for direct attack on the problem. Our servants, the soldiers, lawyers, all forms of govern-ment, make this our nobler work possible, and it is the gravest possible mistake to sneer at those humble but faithful followers of the great minds of the world. What, then, are the best, easiest, directed methods to attain our result? And how shall we, in mortal language, convey to the minds of others the nature of a result so beyond language, baffling even imagina-tion eagle-pinioned? It may help us if we endeavour to outline the distinction between the Hindu and Buddhist methods and aims of the Great Work. The Hindu method is really mystical in the truest sense; for, as I have shown, the Atman is not infinite and eternal: one day"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"tycarb 80 it must sink down with the other forces. But by creating in thought an infinite Impersonal Personality, by defining it as such, all religions except the Buddhist and, as I believe, the Qabalistic, have sought to annihilate their own personality. The Buddhist aims directly at extinction; the Hindu denies and abolished his own finity by the creation of an absolute. As this cannot be done in reality, the process is illusory; yet it is useful in the early stages—as far, at any rate, as the fourth stage of Dhyana, where the Buddha places it, though the Yogis claim to attain to Nirvikalpa-Samadhi, and that Moksha is identical with Nirvana ; the former claim I see no reason to deny them; the latter statement I must decline at present to accept. The task of the Buddhist recluse is roughly as follows. He must plunge every particle of his being into one idea : right views, aspirations, word, deed, life, will-power, medi-tation, rapture, such are the stages of his liberation, which resolves itself into a struggle against the laws of causality. He cannot prevent past causes taking effect, but he can prevent present causes from having any future results. The exoteric Christian and Hindu rather rely on another person to do this for them, and are further blinded by the thirst for life and individual existence, the most formidable obstacle of all, in fact a negation of the very object of all religion. Schopenhauer shows that life is assured to the will-to-live, and unless Christ (or Krishna, as the case may be) destroys these folk by superior power—a task from which almightiness might well recoil baffled !—I much fear that eternal life, and consequently eternal suffering, joy, and change of all kinds, will be their melancholy fate. Such persons are in truth their own real enemies. Many of them, however, believing errone-ously that they are being “unselfish,” do fill their hearts with devotion for the beloved Saviour, and this process is, in its ultimation, so similar to the earlier stages of the Great Work itself, that some confusion has, stupidly enough, arisen ; but for all that the practice has been the means of bringing some de-votees on to the true Path of the Wise, unpromising as such material must sound to intelligent ears. The esoteric Christian or Hindu adopts a middle path. Having projected the Abso-lute from his mind, he endeavours to unite his consciousness with that of his Absolute and of course his personality is destroyed in the process. Yet it is to be feared that such an adept too often starts on the path with the intention of aggrandising his personality to the utmost. But his method is so near to the true one that this tendency is soon corrected, as it were automatically. (The mathematical analogue of this pro-cess is to procure for yourself the realisation of the nothingness of yourself by keeping the fourth dimension ever present to your mind.) The illusory nature of this idea of an in-finite Atman is well shown by the very proof which that most distinguished Vedan-tist, the late Swami Vivekananda (no con-nection with the firm of a similar name1 across the street), gives of the existence of the infinite. “Think of a circle !” says he. “You will in a moment become con-scious of an infinite circle around your original small one.” The fallacy is obvious. The big circle is not infinite at all, but is itself limited by the little one. But to take away the little circle, that is the method of the esoteric Christian or the mystic. But the process is never perfect, because however small the little circle becomes, its relation with the big circle is still finite. But even allowing for a moment that the Absolute is really attainable, is the nothingness of the finity related to it really identical with that attained directly by the Buddhist Arahat? This, consistently with 1 The Swami Vive Ananda, Madame Horos, for whose history consult the Criminal Law Reports."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"AN ESSAY IN ONTOLOGY 81 my former attitude, I feel constrained to deny. The consciousness of the Absolute-wala1 is really extended infinitely rather than diminished infinitely, as he will himself assure you. True, Hegel says: “Pure being is pure nothing !” and it is true that the infinite heat and cold, joy and sorrow, light and darkness, and all the other pairs of opposites,2 cancel one another out: yet I feel rather afraid of this Absolute ! Maybe its joy and sorrow are represented in phases, just as 00 and finity are phases of an iden-tical expression, and I have an even chance only of being on the right side of the fence! The Buddhist leaves no chances of this kind; in all his categories he is infinitely unextended; though the categories themselves exist; he is in fact 0A+B+C+D+E+..+N and capable of no conceivable change, unless we imagine Nirvana to be incomprehensibly divided by Nirvana, which would (supposing the two Nirvanas to possess identical cate-gories) result in the production of the original 00. But a further change would be necessary even then before serious mischief could result. In short, I think we may dismiss from our minds any alarm in respect of this contingency. On mature consideration, therefore, I con-fidently and deliberately take my refuge in the Triple Gem. Namo Tasso Bhagavato Arahato Samma-sambuddhasa!3 Let there be hereafter no discussion of the classical problems of philosophy and religion! In the light of this exposition the 1 Wala, one whose business is connected with anything. E.g. Jangli-wala, one who lives in, or has business with, a jungle, i.e. a wild man, or a Forest Conservator. 2 The Hindus see this as well as any one, and call Atman Sat-chit-ananda, these being above the pairs of opposites, rather on the Hegelian lines of the reconciliation (rather than the identity) of opposites in a master-idea. We have dismissed infinity as the figment of a morbid mathematic: but in any case the same disproof applies to it as to God.—A.C. 3 Hail unto Thee, the Blessed One, the Perfect One, the Enlightened One! antitheses of noumenon and phenomenon, unity and multiplicity, and their kind, are all reconciled, and the only question that re-mains is that of finding the most satisfactory means of attaining Nirvana—extinction of all that exists, knows, or feels; extinction final and complete, utter and absolute ex-tinction. For by these words only can we indicate Nirvana: a state which transcends thought cannot be described in thought’s language. But from the point of view of thought extinction is complete: we have no data for discussing that which is unthinkable, and must decline to do so. This is the answer to those who accuse the Buddha of hurling his Arahats (and himself) from Samma Samadhi to annihilation. Pray observe in the first place that my solution of the Great Problem permits the co-existence of an indefinite number of means: they need not even be compatible; Karma, rebirth, Providence, prayer, sacri-fice, baptism, there is room for all. On the old and, I hope, now finally discredited hypothesis of an infinite being, the supporters of these various ideas, while ex-plicitly affirming them, implicitly denied. Similarly, note that the Qabalistic idea of a supreme God (and innumerable hier-archies) is quite compatible with this theory, provided that the supreme God is not in-finite. Now as to our weapons. The more ad-vanced Yogis of the East, like the Noncon-formists at home, have practically abandoned ceremonial as idle. I have yet to learn, however, by what dissenters have replaced it! I take this to be an error, except in the case of a very advanced Yogi. For there exists a true magical ceremonial, vital and direct, whose purpose has, however, at any rate of recent times, been hopelessly mis-understood. Nobody any longer supposes that any means but that of meditation is of avail to grasp the immediate causes of our being ; if some person retort that he prefers to rely on a Glorified Redeemer, I simply answer"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"tycarb 82 that he is the very nobody to whom I now refer. Meditation is then the means; but only the supreme means. The agony column of the Times is the supreme means of meeting with the gentleman in the brown billycock and frock coat, wearing a green tie and chewing a straw, who was at the soirée of the Carlton Club last Monday night; no doubt ! but this means is seldom or never used in the similar contingency of a cow-elephant desiring her bull in the jungles of Ceylon. Meditation is not within the reach of every one ; not all possess the ability ; very few indeed (in the West at least) have the opportunity. In any case what the Easterns call “one-pointedness” is an essential preliminary to even early stages of true meditation. And iron will-power is a still earlier qualifica-tion. By meditation I do not mean merely “thinking about” anything, however pro-foundly, but the absolute restraint of the mind to the contemplation of a single object, whether gross, fine, or altogether spiritual. Now true magical ceremony is entirely directed to attain this end, and forms a magnificent gymnasium for those who are not already finished mental athletes. By act, word, and thought, both in quantity and quality, the one object of the ceremony is being constantly indicated. Every fumiga-tion, purification, banishing, invocation, evocation, is chiefly a reminder of the single purpose, until the supreme moment arrives, and every fibre of the body, every force-channel of the mind, is strained out in one overwhelming rush of the Will in the direc-tion desired. Such is the real purport of all the apparently fantastic directions of Solomon, Abramelin, and other sages of repute. When a man has evoked and mastered such forces as Taphtartharath, Belial, Amaimon, and the great powers of the elements, then he may be safely be per-mitted to begin to try to stop thinking. For, needless to say, the universe, including the thinker, exists only by virtue of the thinker’s thought.1 In yet one other way is magic a capital training ground for the Arahat. True symbols do really awake those macrocosmic forces of which they are the eidola, and it is possible in this manner very largely to increase the magical “potential” to borrow a term from electrical science. Of course, there are bad and invalid pro-cesses, which tend rather to disperse or to excite the mind-stuff than to control it; these we must discard. But there is a true magical ceremonial, the central Arcanum alike of Eastern and Western practical transcendentalism. Needless to observe, if I knew it, I should not disclose it. I therefore affirm the validity of the Qabalistic tradition in its practical part as well as in those exalted regions of thought through which we have to recently, and so hardly, travelled. Eight are the limbs of Yoga: morality and virtue, control of body, thought, and force, leading to concentration, meditation, and rapture. Only when the last of these has been attained, and itself refined upon by removing the gross and even the fine objects of its 1 See Berkeley and his expounders, for the Western shape of this Eastern commonplace. Huxley, however, curiously enough, states the fact in almost these words.—A.C. 2 A possible mystic transfiguration of the Vedanta system has been suggested to me on the lines of the Syllogism— God = Being (Patanjali). Being = Nothing (Hegel). God = Nothing (Buddhism). Or, in the language of religion: Every one may admit that monotheism, exalted by the introduction of the ∞ symbol, is equivalent to pantheism. Pantheism and atheism are really identical, as the opponents of both are the first to admit.

AUM MANI PADME HOUM"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"84 I. THE purpose of this essay is to draw a strict comparison between the modern scien- tific conceptions of Phenomena and their explanation, where such exists, and the ancient ideas of the Buddhists; to show that Buddhism, alike in theory and practice, is a scientific religion; a logical superstructure on a basis of experimentally verifiable truth ; and that its method is identical with that of science. We must resolutely exclude the accidental features of both, especially of Buddhism; and unfortunately in both cases we have to deal with dishonest and shame-less attempts to foist on either opinions for which neither is willing to stand sponser. Professer Huxley has dealt with one in his “Pseudo-Scientific Realism”; Professer Rhys Davids has demolished the other in that one biting comment on “Esoteric Buddhism” that it was “not Esoteric and certainly not Buddhism.” But some of the Theosophic mud still sticks to the Buddhist chariot; and there are still people who believe that sane science has at least a friendly greeting for Atheism and Materialism in their grosser and more militant forms. Let it be understood then, from the outset, that if in Science I include metaphysics, and in Buddhism meditation-practices, I lend myself neither to the whittlers or “recon-cilers” on the one hand, nor to the Animistic jugglers on the other. Apart from the Theosophic rubbish, we find Sir Edwin Arnold writing: “Whoever saith Nirvana is to cease, Say unto such they lie.” Lie is a strong word and should read “translate correctly.”1 I suppose it would not scan, nor rhyme: but Sir Edwin is the last person to be deterred by a little thing like that. Dr. Paul Carus, too, in the “Gospel of Buddha,” is pleased to represent Nirvana as a parallel for the Heaven of the Christian. It is sufficient if I reiterate the unanimous opinion of competent scholars, that there is no fragment of evidence in any canonical book sufficient to establish such interpretations in the teeth of Buddhist tradition and practice ; and that any person who persists in tuning Buddhism to his own Jew’s harp in this way is risking his reputation, either for scholar-ship or good faith. Scientific men are common enough in the West, if Buddhists are not; and I may safely leave in their hands the task of castigating the sneak-thieves of the Physical area. II. The essential features of Bhuddism have been summed up by the Buddha himself. To me, of course, what the Buddha said or did not say is immaterial; a thing is true or not true, whoever said it. We believe Mr. Savage Landor when he affirms that Lhassa is an important town in Tibet. Where only probabilities are concerned we are of course influenced by the moral char- 1 See Childers, Pali Dictionary, s.v.

We are, I think, justified in discarding passages which are clearly Oriental fiction, just as modern criticism, however secretly Theistic, discards the Story of Hasisadra or of Noah. In justice to Buddhism, let us not charge its Scripture with the Sisyphean task of seriously upholding the literal interpreta-tion of obviously fantastic passages.2 May our Buddhist zealots be warned by the fate of old-fashioned English orthodoxy! But when Buddhism condescends to be vulgarly scientific; to observe, to classify, to think ; I conceive we may take the matter seriously, and accord a reasonable investigation to its assertions. Examples of such succinctness and clarity may be found in The Four Noble Truths ; The Three Characteristics ; The Ten Fetters; and there is clearly a definite theory in the idea of Karma. Such ideas are basic, and are as a thread on which 1 See Huxley’s classical example of the horse, zebra and centaur. 2 Similarly, where Buddhist parables are of a mystical nature, where a complicated symbolism of numbers (for example) is intended to shadow a truth, we must discard them. My experience of mysticism is somewhat large; its final dictum is that the parable x may be equated to a, b, c, d . . . z by six-and-twenty different persons, or by one person in six-and-twenty different moods. Even had we a strong traditional explanation I should maintain my position. The weapons of the Higher Criticism, supplements by comon Sense, are perfectly valid and inevitably destructive against any such structure. But I am surely in danger of becoming ridiculous in writing thus to the scientific world. What I really wish to show is that one ned not look for all the Buddhist fancy dishes to the peril of the scientific digestion. And by a backhanded stroke I wish to impress as deeply as possible upon my Buddhist friends that too much zeal for the accidentals of our religion will surely result in the overwhelming of its essentials in the tide of justly scornful or justly casuistic criticism.—A. C. the beads of Arabian-Night-Entertainment are strung.3 I propose therefore to deal with these and some other minor points of the Buddhist metaphysis, and trace out their scientific analogies, or, as I hope to show, more often identities. First then let us examine that great Summary of the Buddhist Faith, the Four Noble Truths. III. THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS. (1) SORROW.—Existence is Sorrow. This means that “no known form of Existence is seperable from Sorrow.” This truth is stated by Huxley, almost in so many words, in Evolution and Ethics. “It was no less plain to some of these antique philosophers than to the fathers of modern philosophy that suffering is the badge of all the tribe of sentient things; that it is no accidental accompaniment, but an essential constituent of the Cosmic Process.” And in the same essay, though he is disposed to deny more than the rudiments of consciousness to the lower forms of life, he is quite clear that pain varies directly (to put it loosely) with the degree of consciousness.

I take desire here to include such a phenomenon as the tendency of two molecules of hydrogen and chlorine to combine under certain conditions. If death be painful to me, it is presumably so to a molecule ; if we represent one opera-tion as pleasant, the converse is presumably painful. Though I am not conscious of the individual pain of the countless deaths in-volved in this my act of writin, it may be there. And what I call “fatigue” may be the echo in my central consciousness of the 3 See Prof. Rhys Davids on the “Jataka.”"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 86 shriek of a peripheral anguish. Here we leave the domain of fact; but at least as far our knowledge extends, all or nearly all the operations of Nature are vanity and vexation of spirit. Consider food, the desire for which periodically arises in all conscious beings.1 The existence of these desires, or rather necessities, which I realise to be mine, is unpleasant. It is this desire inherent in me for continued consciousness that is responsible for it all, and this leads us to the Third Noble Truth. (3) SORROW’S CEASING.—The cessation of desire is the cessation of sorrow. This is a simple logical inference form the second Truth, and needs no comment. (4) THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH.—There is a way, to be considered later, of realising the Third Truth. But we must, before we can perceive its possibility on the one hand, or its necessity on the other, form a clear idea of what are the Buddhist tenets with regard to the Cosmos; and, in particular, to man.2 IV. THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS. The Three Characteristics (which we may predicate of all known existing things: (a) Change. Anikka. (b) Sorrow. Dukkha. (c) Absence of an Ego. Anatta. 1 Change is the great enemy, the immediate cause of pain. Unable to arrest it, I slow the process, and render it temporarily painless, by eating. This is a concession to weakness, no doubt, in one sense. Do I eat really in order to check change, or to maintain my consciousness? Change I desire, for my present condition is sorrow. I really desire the impossible; completely to retain my present egoity with all its conditions reversed.—A. C. 2 For an able and luminous exposition of “The Four Noble Truths” I refer the reader to the pamphlet bearing that title by by old friend Bikkhu Ananda Maitriya, published by the Buddhasasana Samagama, 1 Pagoda Road, Rangoon.—A. C. This is the Buddhist assertion. What does Science say? (a) Huxley, “Evolution and Ethics”: “As no man fording a swift stream can dip his foot twice into the same water, so no man can, with exactness, affirm of anything in the sensible world that it is. As he utters the words, nay, as he thinks them, the predicate ceases to be applicable; the present has become the past; the ‘is’ should be ‘was.’ And the more we learn of the nature of things the more evident is it that what we call rest is only unperceived activity ; that seeming peace is silent but strenuous battle. In every part, at every moment, the state of the cosmos is the expression of a transitory adjustment of contending forces, a scene of strife, in which all the combatants fall in turn. What is true of each part is true of the whole. Natural knowledge tends more and more to the conclusion that “all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth” are the transitory forms of parcels of cosmic substance wending along the road of evolution, from nebulous potentiality, through endless growths of sun and planet and satellite, through all varieties of matter; through infinite diversities of life and thought, possibly, through modes of being of which we neither have a conception, nor are competent to form any, back to the indefinable latency from which they arose. Thus the most obvious attribute of the cosmos is its impermenance. It assumes the aspect not so much of a permanent entity as of a changeful process, in which naught endures save the flow of energy and the rational order which pervades it.” This is an admirable summary of the Buddhist doctrine. (b) See above on the First Noble Truth. (c) This is the grand position which Buddha carried against the Hindu philosophers. In our own country it is the argument of Hume, following Berkeley to a place where Berkeley certainly never meant to go—a curious parallel fulfilment of Christ’s curse against Peter (John xxi.). The Bishop demolishes the idea of a substratum of matter, and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 87 Hume follows by applying an identical process of reasoning to the phenomena of mind.1 Let us consider the Hindu theory. They classify the phenomena (whether well or ill matters nothing), but represent them all as pictured in, but not affecting, a certain changeless, omniscient, blissful existence called Atman. Holding to Theism, the existence of evil forces them to the Fichtean position that “the Ego posits the Non-Ego,” and we learn that nothing really exists after all but Brahm. They then distinguish between Jivatma, the soul-conditioned, and Paramatma, the soul free; the former being the basis of our normal consciousness; the latter of the Nirvikalpa-Samadhi conscious- 1 The Buddhist position may be interpreted as agnostic in this matter, these arguments being directed against, and destructive of, the unwarranted assumptions of the Hindus; but no more. See Sabbasava Sutta, 10. “In him, thus unwisely considering, there springs up one or other of the six (absurd) notions. “As something real and true he gets the notion, ‘I have a self.’ “As something real and true he gets the notion, ‘I have not a self.’ “As something real and true he gets the notion, ‘By my self, I am conscious of my self.’ “As something real and true he gets the notion, ‘By my self, I am conscious of my non-self.’ “Or again, he gets the notion, ‘This soul of mine can be perceived, it has experienced the result of good or evil actions committed here and there; now this soul of mine is permanent, lasting, eternal, has the inherent quality of never changing, and will contiue for ever and ever!’ “This, brethren, is called the walking in de-lusion, the jungle of delusion, the wilderness of delusion, the puppet-show of delusion, the writhing of delusion, the fetter of delusion.” There are, it may be noted, only five (not six) notions mentioned, unless we take the last as double. Or we may consider the sixth as the contrary of the fifth, and correct. The whole passage is highly technical, perhaps untrustworthy; in any case, this is not the place to discuss it. The sun of Agnosticism breaking through the cloud of Anatta is the phenomenon to which I wished to call attention.—A. C. ness; this being the sole condition on which morals, religion, and fees to priests can continue. For the Deist has only to advance his fundamental idea to be forced round in a vicious circle of absurdities.1 The Buddhist makes a clean sweep of all this sort of nonsense. He analyses the phe-nomena of mind, adopting Berkeley’s para-dox that “matter is immaterial,” in a sane and orderly way. The “common-sense Phi-losopher,” whom I leave to chew the bitter leaves of Professer Huxley’s Essay “On Sensation and the Unity of the Structure of Sensiferous Organs,” observes, on lifting his arm, “I lift my arm.” The Buddhist ex-amines this proposition closely, and begins: “There is a lifting of an arm.” By this terminology he avoids Teutonic discussions concerning the Ego and Non-ego.2 But how does he know this proposi-tion to be true? By sensation. The fact is therefore: “There is a sensation of the lifting of an arm.” But how does he know that? By percep-tion. Therefore he says: “There is a perception of a sensation, &c.” And why this perception? From the in-herent tendency. (Note carefully the determinist standpoint involved in the enunciation of his Fourth Skandha; and that it comes lower than Viññanam.) “There is a tendency to perceive the sensation, &c.” And how does he know that there is a tendency ? By consciousness. The final analysis reads: “There is a consciousness of a tendency to perceive the sensation of a lifting of an arm.” He does not, for he cannot, go further back. He will not suppose, on no sort of evidence, the substratum of Atman uniting 1 As Bishop Butler so conclusively showed. 2 I may incidentally remark that a very few hours’ practice (see Section VIII.) cause “I lift my arm” to be intuitively denied.—A. C."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 88 consciousness to consciousness by its eternity, while it fixes a great gulf between them by its changelessness. He states the knowable, states it accurately, and leaves it there. But there is a practical application of this analysis which I will treat of later. (See VIII. Maha-satipatthana.) We are told that the memory is a proof of some real “I.” But how treacherous is this ground! Did a past event in my life not happen because I have forgotten it? O the analogy of the river water given above is most valid! I who write this am not I who read it over and correct it. Do I desire to play with lead soldiers? Am I the doddering old cripple who must be wheeled about and fed on whisky and bread and milk? And is my difference from them so conspicuously less than from the body lying dead of which those who see it will say. “This was Aleister Crowley”? What rubbish it is to suppose that an eternal substance, sentient or not, omniscient or not, depends for its information on so absurd a series of bodies as are groups under that “Crowley”! Yet the Buddhist meets all arguments of the spiritual order with a simple statement which, if not certain, is at least not improb-able. There is, he will tell you, a “spiritual” world, or to avoid any (most unjustifiable) misunderstandings, let us say a world of subtler matter than the visible and tangible, which has its own laws (analogous to, if not identical with, those laws of matter with which we are acquainted) and whose inhabi-tants change, and die, and are re-born very much as ordinary mortal beings. But as they are of subtler matter, the cycle is less rapid.1 As a nominalist, I hope not to be misunderstood when I compare this to the relative mutability of the individual and the species.2 We have enough examples free 1 Cf. Huxley, cited supra, “possibly, through modes of being of which we neither have a conception, nor are competent to form any. . . .” 2 Cf. “Evolution and Ethics,” note 1. from such possibility of misinterpretation in our own bodies. Compare the longevity of a bone with that of a corpuscle. But it is this “Substratum” universe, which must not be confounded with the substratum, the argu-ments for whose existence Berkeley so utterly shattered,1 which may conserve memory for a period greatly exceeding that of one of its particular avatars. Hence the “Jataka.” But the doctrine is not very essential; its chief value is to show what serious difficulties confront us, and to supply a reason to struggle to some better state. For if nothing 1 Without an elaborate analysis of the ideas involved in the Ding an sich of Kant, and of H. Spencer’s definition of all things as Modes of the Unknowable, I may point out in passing that all these hypotheses are as sterile as the “vital principle” in biology, or “phlogiston” in chemistry. They lead literally nowhere. That the phenomenal world is an illusion is all very well; one girds up one’s loins to seek reality: but to prove reality unknowable is to shut all avenues to the truth-loving man, and open all to the sensualist. And, if we accept either of the above philosophies, it does not matter. That we feel it does matter is sufficient refutation, for we must obey the sentence awarded on our own testimony, whether we like it or not. I am aware that this is a somewhat cowardly way of dealing with the question; I prefer to insist that if we once admit that the unknowable (by reason) to consciousness may be known (by concentration) to super-consciousness, the difficulty vanishes. I think Huxley goes too far in speaking of a man “self-hypnotised into cataleptic trances” without medical evidence of a large number of cases. Edward Carpenter, who has met Yogis, and talked long and learnedly with them, tells a different story. Even had we a large body of evidence from Anglo-Indian medical men, the proof would still be lacking. They might not be the real men. The Indian native would take intense delight in bringing round the village idiot to be inspected in the character of a holy man by the “Doctor Sahib.” The Anglo-Indian is a fool; a minimum medical education is in most cases insufficient to abate the symptoms to nil, though perhaps it must always diminish them.

Why are we to be so altruistic as to avoid the reincarnation of a being in all points different from ourselves? As the small boy said, “What has posterity done for me?” But somethin does persist; something changing, though less slowly. What evi-dence have we after all that an animal does not remember his man-incarnation? Or, as Levi says, “In the suns they remember, and in the planets they forget.” I think it unlikely (may be), but in the total absence of all evidence for or against—at least with regard to the latter hypothesis !—I suspend my judgement, leave the question alone, and proceed to more practical points that are offered by these interesting but not over-useful metaphysical speculations. V. KARMA. The Law of Causation is formally identical with this. Karma means “that which is made,” and I think it should be considered with strict etymological accuracy. If I place a stone on the roof of a house, it is sure to fall sooner or later; i.e., as soon as the con-ditions permit. Also, in its ultimation, the doctrine of Karma is identical with deter-minism. On this subject much wisdom, with an infinite amount of rubbish, has been written. I therefore dismiss it in these few words, confident that the established identity can never be shaken. VI.

Does he stop in the midst, struck by the fear that his thermometer is inaccurate? No! he has, unless he is a fool, tested it previously. We must have our principia fixed before we can do research work. (3) A scientist hardly requires conviction on this point! (4) Do you think to combine Newton and Caligula? The passions, allowed to dominate, interfere with the concentration of the mind. (5) Does brooding on your dislikes help you to accurate observation?

THE RELATIVE REALITY OF CERTAIN STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS Whether we adopt Herbert Spencer’s dictum that the primary testimony of con-sciousness is to the existence of externality, or no;1 whether or no we fly to the extreme idealistic position; there is no question that, to our normal consciousness, things as they present themselves—apart from obvious illusion, if even we dare to except this—are undisprovable to the immediate apprehen-sion. Whatever our reason may tell us, we act precisely as through Berkeley had never lived, and the herculean Kant had been strangled while yet in his cradle by the twin serpents of his own perversity and termi-nology. What criterion shall we apply to the relative realities of normal and dream consciousness? Why do I confidently assert that the dream state is transitory and un-real? In that state I am equally confident that my normal consciousness is invalid. But as my dreams occupy a relatively small portion of my time, and as the law of causa-tion seems suspended, and as their vividness is less than that of ordinary consciousness, and above all, as in the great majority of cases I can show a cause, dating from my waking hours, for the dream, I have four strong reasons (the first explanatory to some extent of my reasons for accepting the others) for concluding that the dream is fictitious. But what of the “dreamless” state? To the dreamer his normal faculties and memo-ries arise at times, and are regarded as frag-mentary and absurd, even as the remembrance of a dream is to the waking man. Can we not conceive then of a “dreamless” life, of 1 Mahasatipatthana (Sec. VIII.) does admit this perhaps. Yet its very object is to correct consciousness on the lines indicated by reason. which our dreams are the vague and disturbed transition to normal consciousness? The physiological evidence goes literally for nothing. Even were it proved that the recipio-motor apparatus of a “dreamless” sleeper was relatively quiescent, would that supply any valid argument against the theory I have suggested? Suggested, for I admit that our present position is completely ag-nostic in respect to it, since we have no evidence which throws light on the matter; and study of the subject would appear to be mere waste of time. But the suggestion is valuable as affording us a possibly rational explanation, conform-able to the waking man, which the dreamer would indignantly reject. Suppose, however, a dream so vivid that the whole waking man is abased before its memory, that his consciousness of it appears a thousand times more real than that of the things about him; suppose that his whole life is moulded to fit the new facts thus re-vealed to him; that he would cheerfully re-nounce years of normal life to obtain minutes of that dream-life; that his time sense is uprooted as never before, and that these influences are permanent. Then, you will say, delirium tremens (and the intoxication of hashish, in respect more particularly of the time sense) afford us a parallel. But the phenomena of delirium tremens do not occur in the healthy. As for the suggestion of auto-hypnosis, the memory of the “dream” is a sufficient reply. However this may be, the simple fact of the superior apparent reality—a conviction unshakable, inépuisable (for the English has no word), is a sufficient test. And if we condescend to argue, it is for pleasure, and aside from the vital fact; a skirmish, and not a pitched battle. This “dream” I have thus described is the state called Dhyana by the Hindus and Buddhists. The method of attaining it is sane, healthy, and scientific. I would not take the pains to describe that method, had not illiterate, and too often mystical advo-cates of the practice obscured the simple"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 91 grandeur of our edifice by jimcrack pinnacles of stucco—as who should hang the Taj Mahal with fairy lamps and chintz. It is simple. The mind is compelled to fix its attention on a single thought; while the controlling power is exercised and a profound watchfulness kept up lest the thought should for a moment stray.1 The latter portion is, to my mind, the essential one. The work is comparable to that of an electrician who should sit for hours with his finger on a delicately adjusted resistance-box and his eye on the spot of light of a galvanometer, charged with the duty of keeping the spot still, at least that it should never move beyond a certain number of degrees, and of recording the more impor-tant details of his experiment. Our work is identical in design, though worked with subtler—if less complex—means. For the finger on the resistance-box we substitute the Will ; and its control extends but to the Mind ; for the eye we substitute the Introspective Faculty with its keen observa-tion of the most minute disturbance, while the spot of light is the Consciousness itself, the central point of the galvanometer scale the predetermined object, and the other figures on the scale, other objects, connected with the primary by order and degree, sometimes obviously, sometimes obscurely, perhaps even untraceably, so that we have no real right to predicate their connection.2 1 Huxley, Essays, V., 136. 2 This last sentence will be best understood by those who have practised up to a certain point. At first it is easy to trace back by a connected chain of thoughts from the thought which awakes us to the fact that we are wandering to the original thought. Later, and notably as we improve, this becomes first difficult, then impossible. At first sight this fact suggests that we are injuring our brains by the practice, but the explanation is as follows: Suppose we figure the central con- sciousness as the Sun, intent on seeing that nothing falls into him. First the near planets are carefully arranged, so that no collision can occur; afterwards Jupiter and Saturn, until his whole system is safe. If then any body fall upon the Sun, he knows that it is How any sane person can describe this process as delusive and unhealthy passes my comprehension; that any scientist should do so implies an ignorance on his part of the facts. I may add that the most rigid necessity exists for perfect health of body and mind before this practice can begin; asceticism is as sternly discouraged as indulgence. How would the electrician do his work after a Guildhall Banquet? The strain of watching would be too much, and he would go off to sleep. So with the meditatior. If, on the other hand, he had been without food for twenty-four hours, he might—indeed, it has been done often—perform prodigies of work for the necessary period; but a reaction must follow of proportionate severity. Nobody will pretend that the best work is done starving.3 Now to such an observer certain pheno-mena present themselves sooner or later which have the qualities above predicated of our imaginary “dream” preceded by a transition-state very like total loss of consciousness. Are these fatigue phenomena? Is it that this practice for some as yet unknown reason stimulates some special nerve-centre ? Perhaps; the subject re-quires investigation; I am not a physio-logist. Whatever physiology may say, it is at least clear that if this state is accom-panied with an intense and passionles bliss beyond anything that the normal man can conceive of, and unaccompanied with the slightest prejudice to the mental and physical health, it is most highly desirable. And to the scientist is presents a magnificent field of research.   not from any of those planets with which he is familiar, and, lord of his own system, cannot trace the course or divine the cause of the accident which has disturbed him. And he will accept this ignorance as a proof of how well his own system is going, since he no longer receives shocks from it.—A. C. 3 Hallucination especially is to be feared. Light-headedness from want of food is quite sufficient explanation for many “Mystic raptures.” I do not care to invoke hysteria and epilepsy without positive evidence.—A. C."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 92 Of the metaphysical and religious theories which have been built upon the facts here stated, I have nothing to say in this place. The facts are not at the disposition of all; from the nature of the subject each man must be his own witness. I was once twitted by some shallow-pated person with the fact that my position cannot be demon-strated in the laboratory, and that therefore (save the mark!) I must be a mystic, an occultist, a theosophist, a mystery-monger, and what not. I am none of these. The above criticism applies to every psychologist that ever wrote, and to the man who makes the criticism by the fact of his making it. I can only say : “You have your own laboratory and apparatus, your mind; and if the room is dirty and the apparatus ill put together, you have certainly not me to blame for it.” The facts being of individual importance, then, there is little use if I detail the results of my own experience. And the reason for this reticence—for I plead guilty to reticence—that to explain would damage the very apparatus whose use I am advoca-ting. For did I say that such and such a practice leads one to see a blue pig, the suggestion is sufficient to cause one class of people to see a blue pig where none existed, and another to deny or suspect the blue pig when it really appeared, though the latter alternative is unlikely. The con-scious phenomenon, and the bliss, is of so stupendous and well-defined a nature that I cannot imagine any preconceived idea power-ful enough to diminish it appreciably. But for the sake of the former class I hold my tongue.1 I trust it is now perfectly clear, if my statements are accepted—and I can only 1 On the advisibility of so doing I am open to conviction. The scientific mind, I might argue, will not readily fall into that error ; and for the others, they will be useless as a research phalanx, and may as well see blue pigs and be happy as not.

C. most seriously assure you that honest labo-rious experiment will be found to verify them in every particular—that whatever arguments are brought forward destructive of the reality of Dhyana, apply with far more force to the normal state, and it is evident that to deny the latter seriously is ipso facto to become unserious. Whether the normal testimony may be attacked from above, by insisting on the superior reality of Dhyana—and à fortiori of Samadhi, which I have not experienced, and conse-quently do not treat of, being content to accept the highly probably statements of those who profess to know, and who have so far not deceived me (i.e. as to Dhyana), is a question which it is not pertinent to the present argument to discuss.1 I shall, however, suggest certain ideas in the follow-ing section, in which I propose to discuss the most famous of the Buddhist medita-tions (Mahasatipatthana, its method, object, and results. VIII. MAHASATIPATTHANA. This meditation differs fundamentally from the usual Hindu methods by the fact that the mind is not restrained to the contemplation of a single object, and there is no interference with the natural functions of the body as there is, e.g., in Pranayama. It is essentially an observation-practice, which later assumes an analytic aspect in regard to the question, “What is it that is really observed?” The Ego-idea is resolutely excluded from the start, and so far Mr. Herbert Spencer will have nothing to object (“Principles of 1 The gravest doubts assail me on further examination of this point. I am now (1906) convinced that the experiences to which I refer constitute Samadhi. The accursed pedentry of the pundits has led to the introduction of a thousand useless subtleties in philosophical terminology, the despair alike of the translator and the investigator, until he realises that it is pedantry, and as worthless as the rest of oriental literature in all matters of exactitude."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 93 Psychology,” ii. 404). The breathing, motions of walking, &c., are merely observed and recording; for instance, one may sit down quietly and say: “There is an indrawing of the breath.” “There is an expiration,” &c. Or, walking, “There is a raising of the right foot,” and so on, just as it happens. The thought is of course not quick enough to note all the movements or their subtle causes. For example, we cannot describe the compli-cated muscular contractions, &c. ; but this is not necessary. Concentrate on some series of simple movements. When this through habit becomes intuitive so that the thought is really “There is a raising,” as opposed to “I raise” (the latter being in reality a complex and adult idea, as philosophers have often shown, ever since Descartes fell into the trap), one may begin to analyse, as explained above, and the second stage is “There is a sensation (Vedana) of a raising, &c.” Sensations are further classed as pleasant or unpleasant. When this is the true intuitive instantaneous testimony of consciousness (so that “There is a raising, &c.” is rejected as a palpable lie),1 we procede to Sañña, perception. “There is a perception of a (pleasant or unpleasant) sensation of a raising, &c.” When this has become intuitive—why ! here’s a strange result ! The emotions of pain and pleasure have vanished. They are subincluded in the lesser skandha of Vedana, and Sañña is free from them. And to him who can live in this third stage, and live so for ever, there is no more pain; only an intense interest similar to that which has enabled men of science to watch and note the progress of their own death-agony. Un- 1 “Why should you expect Vedana to make Rupa appear illusory?” asked a friend of mine, on reading through the MS. of this essay. The reason of my omission to explain is that to me it had seemed obvious. The fact had been assimilated. To meditate on anything is to perceive its unreal nature. Notably this is so in concentrating on parts of the body, such as the nose. On this phenomenon the Hindus have based their famous aphorism, “That which can be thought is not true.”—A. C. fortunately the living in such a state is conditional on sound mental health, and terminable by disease or death at any moment. Were it not so, the First Noble Truth would be a lie. The two further stages Sankhara and Viñ-ñanam pursue the analysis to its ultimation, “There is a consciousness of a tendency to perceive the (pleasant or unpleasant) sensa-tion of a raising of a right foot” being the final form. And I suppose no psychologist of any standing will quarrel with this.1 Reasoning in fact leads us to this analysis; the Buddhist goes further only in so far as he may be said to knock down the scaffolding of reasoning processes, and to assimilate the actual truth of the matter. It is the difference between the schoolboy who painfully construes “Balbus murum ædi-ficavit,” and the Roman who announces that historic fact without a thought of his grammer. I have called this meditation the most famous of the Buddhist meditations, because it is stated by the Buddha himself that if one practices it honestly and intelligently a result is certain. And he says this of no other. I have personally not found the time to devote myself seriously to this Mahasati-patthana, and the statements here made are those derived from reason and not from ex-perience. But I can say that the unreality of the grosser (rupa) relative to the sublter Vedana and still more subtle Sañña be-comes rapidly apparent, and I can only conclude that with time and trouble the process would continue. What will occur when one reaches the final stage of Vññanam, and finds no Atman behind it ? Surely the Viññanam stage will soon seem as unreal as the former have be-come. It is idle to speculate; but if I may escape the imputation of explaining the ob-scure by the more obscure, I may hint that such a person must be very near the state called Nirvana, whatever may be meant by 1 I deal with Mr. Spencer and “Transfigured Realism” in a note at the end of this section.—A. C."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 94 this term. And I am convinced in my own mind that the Ananda (bliss) of Dhyana will surely arise long before one has passed even up to Sankhara. And for the reality, ’twill be a brave jest, my masters, to fling back on the materialists that terrible gibe of Voltaire’s at the mystery-mongers of his day: “Ils nient ce qui est, et expliquent ce qui n’est pas.” NOTE TO SECTION VIII. Transfigured Realism. I will not waste my own time and that of my readers by any lengthy discussion of Mr. Herbert Spencer’s “Transfigured Realism.” I will not point out in greater detail how he proposes, by a chain of reasoning, to overthrow the conclusions he admits as being those of reason. But his statement that Idealism is but verbally intelligible is for my purpose the most admirable thing he could have said. He is wrong in saying that idealists are bewildered by their own terminology ; the fact is that idealist conclusions are pre-sented directly to consciousness, when that consciousness is Dhyanic. (Cf. Section XI.) Nothing is clearer to my mind that that the great difficulty habitually experienced by the normal mind in the assimilation of meta-physics is due to the actual lack of experi-ence in the mind of the reader of the phenomena discussed. I will go so far as to say that perhaps Mr. Spencer himself is so bitter because he himself has actual ex-perience of “Transfigured Realism” as a directly presented phenomenon; for if he supposes that the normal healthy mind can perceive what he perceives, Berkeley’s argu-ments must seem to him mere wanton stupidity. I class the Hindu philosophy with the Idealist; the Bhuddistic with that of Mr. Herbert Spencer; the great difference be-tween the two being that the Buddhists re-cognise clearly these (or similar) conclusions as phenomena, Mr. Spencer, inconsistently enough, only as truths verified by a higher and more correct reasoning than that of his opponents. We recognise, with Berkeley, that reason teaches us that the testimony of conscious-ness is untrue; it is absurd, with Spencer, to refute reason ; instead we take means to bring consciousness to a sense of its impro-bity. Now our (empiric) diagnosis is that it is the dissipation of mind that is chiefly re-sponsible for its untruthfulness. We seek (also by empiric means, alas!) to control it, to con-centrate it, to observe more accurately—has this source of possible error been sufficiently recognised?—what its testimony really is. Experience has taught me, so far as I have been able to go, that Reason and Conscious-ness have met together; Apprehension and Analysis have kissed one another. The re-conciliation (in fact, remember, and not in words) is at least so nearly perfect that I can confidently predict that a further pursuit of the (empirically-indicated) path will surely lead to a still further and higher unity. The realisation of the hopes held out by the hypothesis is then of clear evidential value in support of that hypothesis, empiric as it was, and is. But with the growth and gathering-together, classifying, criticism of our facts, we are well on the way to erect a surer structure on a broader basis. IX. AGNOSTICISM. It should be clearly understood, and well remembered, that throughout all these medi-tations and ideas, there is no necessary way to any orthodox ontology whatever. As to the way of salvation, we are not to rely on the Buddha; the vicious lie of vicarious atonement finds no place here. The Buddha himself does not escape the law of causation ; if this be metaphysics, so far Buddhism is metaphysical, but no further. While deny-ing obvious lies, it does not set up dogmas; all its statements are susceptible of proof—a child can assent to all the more important."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 95 And this is Agnosticism. We have a scien-tific religion. How far would Newton have got if he had stuck to Tycho Brahe as the One Guide? How far the Buddha had he reverenced the Vedas with blind faith? Or how far can we proceed even from partial truth, unless a perfectly open mind be kept regarding it, aware that some new pheno-menon may possibly overthrow our most fun-damental hypotheses ! Give me a reasonable proof of some (intelligent) existence which is not liable to sorrow, and I will throw the First Noble Truth to the dogs without a pang. And, knowing this, how splendid is it to read the grand words uttered more than two thousand years ago: “Therefore, O Ananda, be ye lamps unto yourselves. Be ye a refuge to yourselves. Betake yourselves to no external refuge. Hold fast to the truth as lamp. Hold fast as a refugee to the truth.. Look not for refuge to any one be-sides yourselves.” (Mahaparanibbana Sutta, ii. 33.) And to such seekers only does the Buddha promise “the very topmost Height”—if only they are “anxious to learn.” This is the corner-stone of Buddhism; can scien-tific men deny their assent to these words when they look back on the history of Thought in the West; the torture of Bruno, the shame of Galileo, the obscurantism of the Schoolmen, the “mystery” of the hard-pressed priests, the weapons carnal and spiritual of stake and rack, the labyrinths of lying and vile intrigue by which Science, the child, was deformed, distorted, stunted, in the interest of the contrary proposition? If you ask me why you should be Buddhists and not indifferentists, as you are now, I tell you that I come, however unworthy, to take up the sword that Huxley wielded; I tell you that the Oppressor of Science in her girlhood is already at work to ravish her virginity; that a moment’s hesitation, idle-ness, security may force us back from the positions so hardly won. Are we never to go forward, moreover ? Are our children still to be taught as facts the stupid and indecent fables of the Old Testament, fables that the Archbishop of Canterbury himself would indignantly repudiate ? Are minds to be warped early, the scientific method and imagination checked, the logical faculty thwarted—thousands of workers lost each year to Science? And the way to do this is not only through the negative common-sense of indifference ; organise, organise, organise! For a flag we offer you the stainless lotus-banner of the Buddha, in defence of which no drop of blood has ever been, nor ever will be shed, a banner under which you will join forces with five hundred millions of your fellow-men. And you will not be privates in the army ; for you the highest place, the place of leaders, waits; as far as the triumphs of the intellect are concerned, it is to Western Science that we look. Your achievements have shattered the battle-array of dogma and despotism; your columns roll in triumphant power through the breaches of false meta-physics and baseless logic; you have fought that battle, and the laurels are on your brows. The battle was fought by us more than two thousand years ago; the authority of the Vedas, the restrictions of caste, were shattered by the invulnerable sword of truth in Buddha’s hand; we are your brothers. But in the race of intellect we have fallen behind a little; will you take no interest in us, who have been your comrades? To Science Buddhism cries: Lead us, reform us, give us clear ideas of Nature and her laws; give us that basis of irrefragable logic and wide knowledge that we need, and march with us into the Universe ! The Buddhist faith is not a blind faith ; its truths are obvious to all who are not blinded by the spectacles of bibliolatry and deafened by the clamour of priests, presby-ters, ministers: whatever name they choose for themselves, we can at least put them aside in one great class, the Thought-stiflers; and these truths are thosse which we have long accepted and to which you have recently and hardly won. It is to men of your stamp, men of inde-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 96 pendent thought, of keen ecstasy of love of knowledge, of practical training, that the Buddhasanana Samagama1 appeals; it is time that Buddhism reformed itself from within; though its truths be held untarnished (and even this is not everywhere the case), its methods, its organisation, are sadly in need of repair; research must be done, men must be perfected, error must be fought. And if in the West a great Buddhist society is built up of men of intellect, of the men in whose hands the future lies, there is then an awakening, a true redemption, of the weary and forgetful Empires of the East. X THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH To return from our little digression to the original plan of our essay. It is time to note the “Noble Eightfold Path,” referred to and its consideration deferred, in Sec-tion III. In this Fourth Noble Truth we approach the true direction of Buddhism; progress is but another word for change; is it possible to move in a direction whose goal is the changeless? The answer is Yea and Amen! and it is detailed in the Noble Eightfold Path, of which I propose to give a short resumé. First, however, of the goal. It may be readily syllogised: All existing things are (by nature, inevi-tably) subject to change. In Nirvana is no change. ∴ No existing thing is or can be in Nirvana. Now here is the great difficulty; for this syllogism is perfectly sound, and yet we speak of attaining Nirvana, tasting Nir-vana, &c. [We must distinguish the Hindu Nirvana, which means Cessation of Existence in certain Lokas; never absolute Cessation, as 1 Or International Buddhist Society, founded in Rangoon in 1903. the Buddhist tradition, the etymology, and the logical value alike require for the word as applied to the Buddhist goal. See Chidders, Pali Dictionary, sub voce Nibbana.] The explanation is really as follows : only by this term Nirvana can we foreshadow to you the reality; for even as the Dawn of Dhyana is indescribable in language, à fortiori Nirvana is so. To give an example, for that something of the sort is necessary I freely admit, to defend so apparently mystical a statement, I may give the following from my own experience. In a certain meditation one day I re-corded: “I was (a) conscious of external things seen behind after my nose had vanished. (b) Conscious that I was not conscious of these things. These (a) and (b) were simultaneous.” I subsequently discovered this peculiar state of consciousness classified in the Ab-hidhamma. That it is a contradiction in terms I am perfectly aware; to assign any meaning to it is frankly beyond me; but I am as certain that such a state once existed in me as I am of anything. Similarly with Nirvana and its definition. The Arahat knows what it is, and describes it by its accidentals, such as bliss. I must raise, very reluctantly, a protest against the idea of Professer Rhys Davids (if I have understood him aright) that Nirvana is the mental state resulting from the continuous practice of all the virtues and methods of thought characteristic of Buddhism. No; Nirvana is a state belonging to a different plane, to a higher dimension than anything we can at present conceive of. It has perhaps its analogies and correspondences on the normal planes, and so shall we find of the steps as well as of the Goal. Even the simple first step, which every true Buddhist has taken, Sammaditthi, is a very different thing from the point of view of an Arahat. The Buddha stated expressly that none but an Arahat could really com-prehend the Dhamma."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 97 And so for all the Eight Stages; as regards their obvious meaning on the moral plane, I can do no better than quote my friend Bhikku Ananda Maitriya, in his “Four Noble Truths.” “He who has attained, by force of pure understanding, to the realisation of the Four Noble Truths, who has realised the fact that depends from that understanding, namely that all the constituents of bein are by nature endowed with the Three Character-istics of Sorrow, Transitoriness, and Absence of any immortal principle or Atma—such a one is said to be Sammaditthi, to hold right views, and the term has come to mean one of the Buddhist Faith. We may not have taken the other and higher steps on the Noble Eightfold Path; but must have rea-lised those Four Truths and their sequential three Characteristics. He who has attained Sammaditthi has at least entered upon the Holy Way, and, if he but try, there will come to him the power to overcome the other fetters that restrict his progress. But first of all he must abandon all those false hopes and beliefs; and one who has done this is called a Buddhist. And this holding of Right Views, in Pali Sammaditthi, is the first step upon the Noble Eightfold Path. “The second stage is Right Aspiration—Sammasankappo. Having realised the woe and transitoriness and soullessness of all life, there rises in the mind this Right Aspi-ration. When all things suffer, we at least will not increase their burden, so we aspire to become pitiful and loving, to cherish ill-will toward none, to retire from those pleasures of sense which are the fruitful cause of woe. The will, we all know, is ever readier than the mind, and so, though we aspire to renounce the pleasures of sense, to love and pity all that lives, yet perhaps we often fail in the accomplishment of our aspiration. But if the desire to become pitiful and pure be but honest and earnest, we have gained the Second Step upon the Path—Sammasankappo, Right Aspiration. “He whose motives are pure has no need to conceal the Truth—he who truly loves and who has a malice towards none, will ever speak only fair and soft words. By a man’s speech do we learn his nature, and that one whose Right Aspirations are bearing fruit attains to the Third Step, Right Speech, Sammaváca. Speaking only the Truth in all things, never speaking harshly or un-kindly, in his speech realising the love and pity that is in his heart—that man has attained to Stage the Third. “And because of the great power of a man’s thoughts and words to change his being, because by thinking of the pitiful our acts grow full of mercy, therefore is Stage the Fourth called Right Conduct. To him who has gained this Fourth Stage, his intense as-piration, his right understanding, his care-fully guarded speech—perhaps for many years of self-control—have at last borne outward fruit, till all his acts are loving, and pure, and done without hope of gain, he has attained the Fourth Step, called Sammakammanto. “And when, growing yet holier, that habit of Right Action grows firm and inalienable, when his whole life is lived for the Faith that is in him, when every act of his daily life, yea, of his sleep also, is set to a holy purpose, when not one thought or deed that is cruel or unpitiful can stain his being—when, not even as a duty, will he inflict pain by deed, word, or thought—then he has gained the Fifth High Path, the Living of the Life that’s Right—Sammá ajivo. Abstaining from all that can cause pain, he has become blameless, and can live only by such occupations as can bring no sorrow in their train.1 “To him who has lived so, say the Holy Books, there comes a power which is unknown to ordinary men. Long training and restraint have given him conquest of his mind, he can 1 From my point of view, this is of course impossible. See Sec. III. If wilful infliction of pain only is meant, our state becomes moral, or even worse!—mystical. I should prefer to cancel this sentence. Cf. Appendix I.—A. C. [“The Three Characteristics.” – T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 98 now bring all his powers with tremendous force to bear upon any one object he may have in view, and this ability so to use the energies of his being to put forth a constant and tremendous effort of the will, marks the attainment of the Sixth Stage, Sammávayamo, usually translated Right Effort, but perhaps Right Will-Power would come nearer to the meaning, or Right Energy, for effort has been made even to attain to Sammaditthi.1 And this power being gained by its use he is enabled to concentrate all his thoughts and hold them always upon one object—waking or sleeping, he remembers who he is and what his high aim in life—and this constant recollection and keeping in mind of holy things, is the Seventh Stage, Sammasati. And by the power of this transcendent faculty, rising through the Eight High Trances to the very threshold of Nirvana, he at last, in the Trance called Nirodha Samapatti, attains, even in this life, to the Deathless Shore of Nirvana, by the power of Sammasamadhi, Right Concentration. Such a one has finished the Path—he has destroyed the cause of all his chain of lives, and has become Arahan, a Saint, a Buddha himself.” But none knows better than the venerable Bhikkhu himself, as indeed he makes clear with regard to the steps Sammávayamo and above, that these interpretations are but reflections of those upon a higher plane—the scientific plane. They are (I have little doubt) for those who have attained to them mnemonic keys to whole classes of pheno-mena of the order anciently denominated magical, phenomena which, since the human mind has had its present constitution, have been translated into language, classified, sought after, always above language, but not beyond a sane and scientific classification, a rigid and satisfactory method, as I most firmly believe. It is to establish such a method; to record in the language, not of the temple, but of the laboratory, its results, 1 It is of course a special kind of effort, not mere struggle. that I make this appeal ; that I seek to enlist genuine, not pseudo-scientific men in the Research ; so that our children may be as far in advance of us in the study of the supernormal phenomena of the mind as we are in advance of our fathers in the sciences of the physical world.1 Note carefully this practical sense of my intention. I care nothing for the academic meanings of the steps in the Path; what they meant to the Arahats of old is indifferent to me. “Let the dead past bury its dead!” What I require is an advance in the Know-ledge of the Great Problem, derived no longer from hearsay revelation, from exalted fanati-cism, from hysteria and intoxication; but from method and research. Shut the temple ; open the laboratory! XI. THE TWILIGHT OF THE GERMANS.2 It is a commonplace of scientific men that metaphysics is mostly moonshine; that it is largely an argument in a circle cannot easily be disputed; that the advance since Aristotle is principally verbal none may doubt; that no parallel advance to that of science has been made in the last fifty years is certain. The reason is obvious. Philosophy has had two legitimate weapons —introspection and reason; and introspec-tion is not experiment. 1 A few weeks after writing these words I came across the following passage in Tyndall’s “Scientific Materialism” which I had not previously read: “Two-thirds of the rays emitted by the sun fail to arouse the sense of vision. The rays exist, but the visual organ requisite for their translation into light does not exist. And so, from this region of darkness and mystery which now surrounds us, rays may now be dartin, which require but the development of the proper intellectual organs to translate them into knowledge as far surpassing ours as ours surpasses that of the wallowing reptiles which once held possession of this planet.”—A. C. 2 A Note showing the necessity and scope of the Work in question."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 99 The mind is a machine that reasons; here are its results. Very good; can it do anything else? This is the question not only of the Buddhist; but of the Hindu, of the Mohammedan, of the Mystic. All try their various methods; all attain results of sorts; none have had the genuine training which would have enabled them to record those results in an intelligible, orderly form. Others deliberately set their face against such an attempt. I am not of them; humanity has grown up; if the knowledge be dangerous in unexpected ways, what of bacteriology? I have obtained one result; a result striking at the very condition of consciousness; which I may formulate as follows: “If a single state of consciousness persist unchanged for a period exceeding a very few seconds, its duality is annihilated; its nature is violently overthrown; this phenomenon is accompanied by an indescribable sensation of bliss.” Very well! but I want this formula verified a hundred times, a thousand times, by independent investigators. I want it better stated; its conditions modified, defined ex-actly. I want it to leave its humble station as my observation, and put into the class of regular phenomena. But I am verging back towards Hindu philosophy, and it is a reminder well needed at this moment. For this experience of the destruction of duality, this first phenomenon in the series, has, in all its illusory beauty, been seized upon, generalised from, by philo-sophers, and it is to this basis of partial and therefore deceptive fact that we owe the systems of Vedanta and Idealism, with their grotesque assumptions and muddle-headed “reconcilements” all complete. One fact, O Sri Çankaracharya, does not make a theory; let us remember your fate, and avoid generalising on insufficient evi-dence. With this word of warning, I leave the metaphysician to wallow in his mire, and look toward better times for the great problems of philosophy. Remember that when the solution is attained it is not the solution of one learned man for his fellows, but one realised and assimilated by every man in his own consciousness. And what the solution may be none of us can foreshadow. To hoist the problem on to the horns of a dilemma will avail nothing when A=A may be no longer true ; and this by no Hegelian word-juggle ; but by direct apperception as clear as the sun at noon. Therefore; no work more, but—to the work ! XII. THE THREE REFUGES. Buddham Saranangachami. Dhammam Saranangachami. Sangham Saranangachami. I take my refuge in the Buddha. I take my refuge in the Dhamma. I take my refuge in the Sangha. This formula of adhesion to Buddhism is daily repeated by countless millions of humanity; what does it mean? It is no vain profession of reliance on others; no cowardly shirking of burdens—burdens which cannot be shirked. It is a plain estimate of our auxiliaries in the battle; the cosmic facts on which we may rely, just as a scientist “relies” on the conservation of energy in making an experiment. Were that principle of uncertain applica-tion, the simplest quantitative experiment would break hopelessly down. So for the Buddhist. I take my refuge in the Buddha. That there was once a man who found the Way is my encouragement. I take my refuge in the Dhamma. The Law underlying phenomena and its unchanging certainty; the Law given by the Buddha to show us the Way, the inevitable tendency to Persistence in Motion or Rest—and Persist-ence, even in Motion, negates change in consciousness—these observed orders of fact are our bases."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 100 I take my refuge in the Sangha. These are not isolated efforts on my part; although in one sense isolation is eternally perfect and can never be overcome,1 in another sense associates are possible and desirable. One third of humanity are Buddhists; add men of Science and we form an absolute majority ; among Buddhists a very large proportion have deliberately gone out from social life of any kind to tread these paths of Research. Is the Way very hard? Is the brain tired? The results slow to come? Others are working, failing, struggling, crowned here and there with rare garlands of success. Success for ourselves, success for others; is it not Compassion that binds us closer than all earthly ties? Ay, in joy and in sorrow, in weakness and in strength, do I take my refuge in the Sangha. XIII CONCLUSION Let me give a rapid resumé of what we have gone through. (a) We have stripped Science and Buddhism of their accidental garments, and administered a rebuke to those who so swathe them. (b) We have shown the identity of Science and Buddhism in respect of: (1) Their fact. (2) Their theory. (3) Their method. (4) Their enemies. (c) While thus admitting Buddhism to be merely a branch of Science, we have shown it to be a most important branch, since its promise is to break down the walls at which Science stops. When Professor Ray Lankester has to write, “The whole order of nature, including living and lifeless matter—man, animal, and 1 i.e., on normal planes gas—is a network of mechanism, the main features and many details of which have been made more or less obvious to the wondering intelligence of mankind by the labour and ingenuity of scientific investi-gators. But no sane man has ever pre-tended, since science became a definite body of doctrine, that we know or ever can hope to know or conceive of the possibility of knowing, whence this mechanism has come, why it is there, whither it is going, and what there may or may not be beyond and beside it which our senses are incapable of appreciating. These things are not ‘explained’ by science, and never can be,” he gives a curious example of that quaint scientific pride which knows the limits of its powers, and refuses to entertain the hope of transcending them. Unfortunately, he is as one who, a hundred years ago, should have declared any knowledge of the chemistry of the fixed stars impossible. To invent new methods, and to revolutionise the functions of the senses by training or other-wise is the routine work of to-morrow.1 But, alas ! he goes even further. “Similarly we seek by the study of cerebral disease to trace the genesis of the phenomena which are supposed by some physicists who have strayed into biological fields to justify them in announcing the ‘discovery’ of ‘Telepathy’ and a belief in ghosts.” To talk of cerebral disease as the char-acteristic of one who merely differs from you (and that because he has more know-ledge than yourself) is itself a symptom familiar to alienists. (I may say I hold no brief for Professor Lodge, here attacked. I am not even interested in any of his results, as such of them as I am acquainted with deal with objective and trivial pheno-mena.) Of course, as long as what Darwin called variation is called disease by Professor Ray Lankester, we shall (if we accept his views, 1 See note p. 98"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM 101 and it will go hard with us if we do not !) regard all progress in any direction as morbid. So (as with Lombroso) “disease” will become a mere word, like its prede-cessor “infidelity,” and cease to carry any obloquy. If Science is never to go beyond its present limits; if the barriers which meta-physical speculation shows to exist are never to be transcended, then indeed we are thrown back on faith, and all the rest of the nauseous mess of medieval superstition, and we may just as well have vital principle and creative power as not, for Science cannot help us. True, if we do not use all the methods at our disposal! But we go beyond. We admit that all mental methods known are singularly liable to illusion and inaccuracy of any sort. So were the early determinations of specific heat. Even biologists have erred. But to the true scientist every failure is a stepping-stone to success; every mistake is the key to a new truth. And the history of our Science is the history of all Science. If you choose to ape Christendom and put the pioneers of rational investigation into the nature of consciousness on the rack (i.e. into lunatic asylums) I doubt not we shall find our Bruno. But it will add an additional pang that persecution should come from the house of our friends. Let us, however, turn away from the aspect of criticism which an accidentla controversy has thus caused me to notice, and so to anticipate the obvious line of attack which the more frivolous type of critic will employ, and return to our proper business, the summary of our own position with regard to Buddhism. Buddhism is a logical development of the observed facts; whoso is with me so far is Sammaditthi, and has taken the first step on the Noble Eightfold Path. Let him aspire to knowledge, and the Second Step is under his feet. The rest lies with Research.  Aum ! I take my refuge holy in the Light and Peace of Buddh. Aum ! I take my refuge, slowly working out His Law of Good. Aum ! I take my refuge lowly in His Pitying Brotherhood."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"102 “LISTEN to the Jataka!” said the Buddha. And all they gave ear. “Long ago, when King Brahmadatta reigned in Benares,1 it came to pass that there lived under his admirable government a weaver named Suraj Ju2 and his wife Chandi.3 And in the fulness of her time did she give birth to a man child, and they called him Perdu’ R Abu.4 Now the child grew, and the tears of the mother fell, and the wrath of the father waxed: for by no means would the boy strive in his trade of weaving. The loom went merrily, but to the rhythm of a mantra; and the silk slipped through his hands, but as if one told his beads. Where-fore the work was marred, and the hearts of the parents were woe because of him. But it is written that misfortune knoweth not the hour to cease, and that the seed of sorrow is as the seed of the Banyan Tree. It groweth and is of stature as a mountain, and, ay me! it shooteth down fresh roots into the aching earth. For the boy grew and became a man; and his eyes kindled with the lust of life and love; and the de-sire stirred him to see the round world and its many marvels. Wherefore he went forth, taking his father’s store of gold, laid up for him against that bitter day, and he took fair maidens, and was their servant. And he builded a fine house and dwelt therein. And he took no thought. But he said : Here is a change indeed ! 1 The common formula for beginning a “Jataka,” or story of a previous incarnation of the Buddha. Brahmadatta reigned 120,000 years. 2 The Sun. 3 The Moon. 4 Perdurabo. Crowley’s motto. “Now it came to pass that after many years he looked upon his love, the bride of his heart, the rose of his garden, the jewel of his rosary; and behold, the olive loveliness of smooth skin was darkened, and the flesh lay loose, and the firm breasts drooped, and the eyes had lost alike the glream of joy and the sparkle of laughter and the soft glow of love. And he was mindful of his word, and said in sorrow, ‘Here is then a change indeed !’ And he turned his thought to himself, and saw that in his heart was also a change: so that he cried, ‘Who then am I ?’ And he saw that all this was sorrow. And he turned his thought without and saw that all things were alike in this; that nought might escape the threefold misery. ‘The soul,’ he said, ‘the soul, the I, is as all of these ; it is impermanent as the ephemeral flower of beauty in the water that is born and shines and dies ere sun be risen and set again.’ “And he humiliated his heart and sang the following verse: Brahma, and Vishnu, and great Shiva ! Truly I see the Trinity in all things dwell, Some rightly tinged of Heaven, others duly Pitched down the steep and precipice of Hell. Nay, not your glory ye from fable borrow ! These three I see in spirit and in sense, These three, O miserable see ! Sorrow, Absence of ego, and impermanence ! And at the rhythm he swooned, for his old mantra surged up in the long-sealed vessels of sub-conscious memory, and he fell into the calm ocean of a great Meditation. 1902 THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS 103 II “Jehjaour1 was a mighty magician; his soul was dark and evil; and his lust was of life and power and of the wreaking of hatred upon the innocent. And it came to pass that he gazed upon a ball of crystal wherein were shown him all the fears of the time unborn as yet on earth. And by his art he saw Perdu’ R Abu, who had been his friend : for do what he would, the crystal showed always that sensual and frivolous youth as a Fear to him : even to him the Mighty One ! But the selfish and evil are cowards; they fear shadows, and Jehjaour scorned not his art. ‘Roll on in time, thou ball!’ he cried. ‘Move down the stream of years, timeless and hideous servant of my will! Taph ! Tath ! Arath !’2 He sounded the triple summons, the mysterious syllables that bound the spirit to the stone. “Then suddenly the crystal grew a blank; and thereby the foiled wizard knew that which threatened his power, his very life, was so high and holy that the evil spirit could perceive it not. ‘Avaunt !’ he shrieked, ‘false soul of darkness !’ And the crystal flashed up red, the swarthy red of hate in a man’s cheek, and darkened utterly. “Foaming at the fouth the wretched Jeh-jaour clutched at air and fell prone. III. “To what God should he appeal? His own, Hanuman, was silent. Sacrifice, prayer, all were in vain. So Jehjaour gnashed his teeth, and his whole force went out in a mighty current of hate towards his former friend. 1 Allan MacGragor Bennett (whose motto in the “Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,” was Iehi Aour, i.e. “Let there be Light”), now Ananda Metteya, to whom the volume in which this story was issued is inscribed. 2 Taphtatharath [more usually Taphthartharath – T.S.], the spirit of Mercury. “Now hate hath power, though not the power of love. So it came about that in his despair he fell into a trance; and in the trance Mara1 appeared to him. Never before had his spells availed to call so fearful a potency from the abyss of matter. ‘Son’ cried the Accursèd One, ‘seven days of hate unmarred by passion milder, seven days without one thought of pity, these avail to call me forth.’ ‘Slay me my enemy!’ howled the wretch. But Mara trembled, ‘Enquire of Ganesha concernin him!’ faltered at last the fiend. “Jehjaour awoke. IV. “ ‘Yes !’ said Ganesha gloomily, ‘the young man has given me up altogether. He tells me I am as mortal as he is, and he doesn’t mean to worry about me any more.’ ‘Alas !’ sighed the deceitful Jehjaour, who cared no more for Ganesha and any indignities that might be offered him than his enemy did. ‘One of my best devotees too !’ muttered, or rather trumpeted, the elephantine anachronism. ‘You see,’ said the wily wizard, ‘I saw Perdu’ R Abu the other day, and he said that he had become Srotapatti. Now that’s pretty serious. In seven births only, if he but pursue the path, will he cease to be reborn. So you have only that time in which to win him back to your worship.’ The cunning sorcerer did not mention that within that time also must his own ruin be accomplished. ‘What do you advise ?’ asked the irritated and powerful, but unintelligent deity. ‘Time is our friend,’ said the enchanter. ‘Let your influence be used in the Halls of Birth that each birth may be as long as possible. Now the elephant is the longest lived of all beasts—’ ‘Done with you !’ said Ganesha in great glee, for the idea struck him as ingenious.

But in spite of the young gently-ambling cows which Ganesha took care to throw in his way, in spite of the tender shoots of green and the soft cocoanuts, this elephant was not as other elephants. The seasons spoke to him of change—the forest is ever full of sorrow—and nobody need preach to him the absence of an ego, for the brutes have had more sense than ever to imagine there was one. So the tusker was usually to be found, still as a rock, in some secluded place, meditating on the Three Characteristics. And when Ganesha appeared in all his glory, he found him to his disgust quite free from elephanto-morphism. In fact, he quietly asked the God to leave him alone. “Now he was still quite a young elephant when there came into the jungle, tripping merrily along, with a light-hearted song in its nucleolus, no less than a Bacillus. “And the elephant died. He was only seventeen years old.” VI. “A brief consultation ; and the Srotapatti was reincarnated as a parrot. For the parrot, said the wicked Jehjaour, may live 500 years and never feel it. “So a grey wonder of wings flitted into the jungle. So joyous a bird, thought the God, could not but be influenced by the ordinary passions and yield to such majesty as his own. “But one day there came into the jungle a strange wild figure. He was a man dressed in the weird Tibetan fashion. He had red robes and hat, and thought dark things. He whirled a prayer-wheel in his hands; and ever as he went he muttered the mystic words ‘Aum Mani Padme Hum.’1 The parrot, who had never heard human speech, tried to mimic the old Lama, and was amazed at his success. Pride first seized the bird, but it was not long before the words had their own effect, and it was in meditation upon the conditions of existence that he eternally re-peated the formula. * * * “A home at distant Inglistan.

When the applause and praise and glory had a little faded, the Buddha, in that golden delight of sunset, explained these marvellous events. “Thou, Abhavananda,” he said, “art the Perdu’ R Abu of my lengthy tale.

It was at his 119th year,1 the Star Suaconch2 being in the sign of the Lion, that our Father set out from his Castle of Ug3 to attain the Quintessence or Philosophical Tincture. The way being dark and the Golden Dawn at hand, he did call forth four servants to keep him in the midst of the way, and the Lion roared before him to bid the opposers beware of his coming. On the Bull he rode, and on his left hand and his right marched the Eagle and the Man. But his back was uncovered, seeing that he would not turn. And the Spirit of the Path met him. It was a young girl of two and twenty years, and she warned him that without the Serpent5 his ways were but as wool cast into the dyer’s vat. Two-and-twenty scales had the Serpent, and every scale was a path, and every path was alike an enemy and a friend. So he set out, and the darkness grew upon him.

She held in leash the four Beasts, but he strode boldly to her, and kissed her full on the lips. Wherefore she signed and fell back a space, and he pressed on. Now at the end of the darkness a fire glowed: she would have hindered him: clung she to his neck and wept. But the fire grew and the light dazzled her; so that with a shriek she fell. But the beasts flung themselves against the burning gateway of iron, and it gave way. Our Father passed into the fire. Some say that it consumed him utterly and that he died; howbeit, it is certain that he rose from a sarcophagus, and in the skies stood an angel with a trumpet, and on that trumpet he blew so mighty a blast that the dead rose all from their tombs, and our Father among them. “Now away !” he cried. “I would look upon the sun !” And with that the fire hissed like a myriad of serpents and went out suddenly. It was a green sward golden with buttercups ; and in his way lay a high wall. Before it were two children, and with obscene gestures they embraced, and laughed aloud, with filthy words and acts unspeakable. Over all of which stood the sun calm and radiant, and was glad to be. Now, think ye well, was our Father perplexed; and he knew not what he would do. For the children left their foulness and came soliciting with shameless words his acquiscence in their sport ; and he, knowing the law of courtesy and pity, rebuked them not. But master ever of himself he abode alone, about and above. So he saw his virginity deflowered, and his thoughts were otherwere. Now loosed they his body ; he bade it leap the wall. The giant flower of ocean bloomed above him! He had fallen headlong into the great deep. As the green and crimson gloom disparted somewhat before his eyes, he was aware of a Beetle that steadily and earnestly moved across the floor of that Sea unutterable. Him he followed; “for I wit well,” thought the Adept, “that he goeth not back to the gross sun of earth. And if the sun hath become a beetle, may the beetle transform unto a bird.” Wherewith he came to land. Night shone by lamp of wining moon upon a misty land-scape. Two paths led him to two towers; and jackals howled on either. Now the jackal he knew; and the tower he knew not yet. Not two would he conquer—that were easy: to victory over one did he aspire. Made he therefore toward the moon. Rough was the hillside and the shadows deep and treacherous; as he advanced the towers seemed to approach onoe another closer and closer yet. He drew his sword : with a crash they came together; and he fell with wrath upon a single fortress. Three windows had the tower; and against it ten cannons thundered. Eleven bricks had fallen dislodged by lightning : it was no house wherein our Father might abide. But there he must abide. “To destroy it I am come,” he said. And through he passed out therewithal, yet ’twas his home until he had attained. So at last he came to a river, and sailing to its source he found a fair woman all naked, and she filled the river from two vessels of pure water. “She-devil,” he cried, “have I gone back one step ?” For the Star Venus burned above. And with his sword he clave her from the head to the feet, that she fell clean asunder.

And ill it was, for a temple was set up in his way, and there he saw the grisly Goat enthroned. But he knew better than to judge a goat from a goat’s head and hoofs. And the first week he sacrificed to that goat1 a crown every day. The second a phallus. The third a silver vase of blood. The fourth a royal sceptre. The fifth a sword. The sixth a heart. The seventh a garland of flowers. The eighth a grass-snake. The ninth a sickle. And the tenth week did he daily offer up his own body. Said the goat: “Though I be not an ox, yet am I a sword.” “Masked, O God !” cried the Adept. “Verily, an thou hadst not sacrificed—” There was silence. And under the Goat’s throne was a rainbow2 of seven colours: our Father fitted himself as an arrow to the string (and the string was waxed well, dipped in a leaden pot wherein boiled amber and wine) and shot through stormy heavens. And they that saw him saw a woman wondrous fair3 robed in flames of hair, moon-sandalled, sun-belted, with torch and vase of fire and water. And he trailed comet-clouds of glory upward. Thus came our Father (Blessed be his name!) to Death,4 who stood, scythe in hand, opposed. And ever and anon he swept round, and men fell before him. “Look,” said Death, “my sickle hath a cross-handle. See how they grow like flowers !” “Give me salt !” quoth our Father. And with sulphur (that the Goat had given him) and with salt did he bestrew the ground. “I see we shall have ado together,” says Death. “Aye!” and with that he lops off Death’s cross-handle. Now Death was wroth indeed, for he saw that our Father had wit of his designs (and they were right foul !), but he bade him pass forthwith through his dominion. And our Father could not at that time stay him: though for himself had he cut off the grip, yet for others—well, let each man take his sword! The way went through a forest. Now between two trees hung a man by one heel (Love was that tree).5 Crossed were his legs, and his arms behind his head, that hung ever downwards, the fingers locked. “Who art thou ?” quoth our Father. “He that came before thee.” “Who am I ?” “He that cometh after me.” With that worshipped our Father, and took a present of a great jewel from him, and went his ways. And he was bitterly a-cold, for that was the great Water he had passed. But our Father’s paps glittered with cold, black light, and likewise his navel. Wherefore he was comforted. Now came the sudden twittering of heart lest the firmament beneath him were not stable, and lo! he danceth up and down as a very cork on waters of wailing. “Woman,” he bade sternly, “be still. Cleave that with thy sword: or that must I well work?” But she cleft the cords, bitter-faced, smiling goddess as she was; 1 The sacrifices are the ten Sephiroth. 2 See Table. 3 Ancient form of the Key of s. 4 Considered as the agent of resurrection. 5 In the true key of m the tree is shaped like the letter d = Venus or love.

Now is our Father come to the Unstable Lands, ’Od wot, for the Wheel whereon he poised was ever turning. Sworded was the Sphinx, but he out-dared her in riddling : deeper pierced his sword: he cut her into twain: her place was his. But that would he not, my Brethren; to the centre he clomb ever: and having won thither, he vanished. As a hermit ever he travelled and the lamp and wand were his. In his path a lion roared, but to it ran a maiden, strong as a young elephant, and held its cruel jaws. But force he ran to her : he freed the lion—one buffet of his hand dashed her back six paces ! —and with another blow smote its head from its body. And he ran to her and by force embraced her. Struggled she and fought him: savagely she bit, but it was of no avail: she lay ravished and exhausted on the Lybian plain. Across the mouth he smote her for a kiss, while she cried: “O ! thou hast begotten on me twins. And mine also is the Serpent, and thou shalt conquer it and it shall serve thee: and they, they also for a guide!” She ceased; and he, having come to the world’s end, pre- pared his chariot. Foresquare he builded it, and that double: he har- nessed the two sphinxes that he had made from one, and sailed, crab-fashion, backwards, through the amber skies of even. Wherefore he attained to see his children. Lovers they were and lovely, those twins of rape. One was above them, joining their hands. “That is well,” said our Father, and for seven nights he slept in seven starry palaces, and a sword to guard him. Note well also that these children, and those others, are two, being four. And on the sixth day (for the seven days were past) he rose and came into his ancient temple, a temple of our Holy Order, O my Brethren, wherein sat that Hierophant who had initiated him of old. Now read he well the riddle of the Goat (Blessed be his name among us for ever ! Nay, not for ever !), and therewith the Teacher made him a master of Sixfold Chamber, and an ardent Sufferer toward the Blazing Star. For the Sword, said the Teacher, is but the Star unfurled.2 And our Father being cunning to place Aleph over Tau read this reverse, and so beheld Eden, even now and in the flesh. Whence he sojourned far, and came to a great Emperor, by whom he was well received, and from whom he gat great gifts. And the Emperor (who is Solomon) told him of Sheba’s Land and of one fairest of women there enthroned. So he journeyed thither, and for four years and seven months abode with her as paramour and light-of-love, for she was gracious to him and showed him those things that the Emperor had hidden ; even the cubical stone and the cross beneath the triangle that were his and un-revealed. And on the third day he left her and came to Her who had initiated him before he was initiated ; and with he he abode eight days and twenty days :3 and she gave him gifts. 1 Lamed means ox-goad; Aleph, an ox.

And she gave him the great and perfect gift of Magic, so that he fared forth right comely and well-provided. Now at that great wedding was a Suggler,3 a riddler : for he said, “Thou hast beasts : I will give thee weapons one for one.” For the Lion did our Father win a little fiery wand like a flame, and for his Eagle a cup of ever flowing water : for his Man the Suggler gave him a golden-hilted dagger (yet this was the worst of all his bargains, for it could not strike other, but him-self only), while for a curious coin he bartered his good Bull. Alas for our Father! Now the Suggler mocks him and cries: “Four fool’s bargains hast thou made, and thou art fit to go forth and meet a fool4 for thy mate.” But our Father counted thrice seven and cried: “One for the fool,” seeing 1 3, the number of g. 2, the number of the card g. 2 The equality of three and eight is attributed to Binah, a high grade of Theurgic attainment. 3 Scil.

For she would not any should know thereof. Yet all were right, both he and they. But truth ran quickly about; for that was the House of Truth; and Mercury stood far from the Sun. Yet the Suggler was ever in the Sign of Sorrow, and the Fig Tree was not far. So went our Father to the Fool’s Paradise of Air. But it is not lawful that I should write to you, brethren, of what there came to him at that place and time; nor indeed is it true, if it were written. For alway doth this Arcanum differ from itself on this wise, that the Not and the Amen,1 passing, are void either on the one side or the other, and Who shall tell their ways ? So our Father, having won the Serpent Crown, the Uræus of Antient Khem, did bind it upon his head, and rejoiced in that Kingdom for the space of two hundred and thirty and one days2 and nights, and turned him toward the Flaming Sword.3 Now the Sword governeth ten mighty King-doms, and evil, and above them is the ninefold lotus, and a virgin came forth unto him in the hour of his rejoicing and propounded her riddle. The first riddle :4 The maiden is blind. Our Father : She shall be what she doth not. And a second virgin came forth to him and said : The second riddle : Detegitur Yod. Quoth our Father : The moon is full. So also a third virgin the third riddle : Man and woman : O fountain of the balance! To whom our Father answered with a swift flash of his sword, so swift she saw it not. Came a fourth virgin, having a fourth riddle : What egg hath no shell ? And our Father pondered a while and then said : On a wave of the sea : on a shell of the wave : blessed be her name ! The fifth virgin issued suddenly and said : I have four arms and six sides : red I am, and gold. To whom our Father : Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani ! (For wit ye well, there be two Arcana therein.) Then saith the sixth virgin openly : Power lieth in the river of fire. And our Father laughed aloud and answered : I am come from the waterfall. So at that the seventh virgin came forth: and her countenance was troubled. The seventh riddle : The oldest said to the most beautiful: What doest thou here ? 1 This is obscure. 2 0 + 1 + 2 + . . . + 21 = 231. 3 The Sephiroth. 4 The maiden (Malkuth) is blind (unredeemed).

Thereat was commotion and bitter wailing, and the eighth virgin came forth with rent attire and cried the eighth riddle : The sea hath conceived. Our Father raised his head, and there was a great darkness. The ninth virgin, sobbing at his feet, the ninth riddle : By wisdom. Then our Father touched his crown and they all rejoiced : but laughing he put them aside and he said : Nay ! By six hundred and twenty1 do ye exceed! Whereat they wept, and the tenth virgin came forth, bearing a royal crown having twelve jewels : and she had but one eye, and from that the eyelid had been torn. A prodigious beard had she, and all of white : and they wist he would have smitten her with his sword. But he would not, and she propounded unto him the tenth riddle : Countenance beheld not countenance. So thereto he answered: Our Father, blessed be thou !— Countenance ? Then they brought him the Sword and bade him smite withal : but he said : If countenance behold not countenance, then let the ten be five. And they wist that he but mocked them ; for he did bend the sword fivefold and fashioned therefrom a Star, and they all vanished in that light ; yet the lotus abode nine-petalled and he cried, “Before the wheel, the axle.” So he chained the Sun,2 and slew the Bull, and exhausted the Air, breathing it deep into his lungs : then he broke down the ancient tower, that which he had made his home, will he nill he, for so long, and he slew the other Bull, and he broke the arrow in twain ; after that he was silent, for they grew again in sixfold order, so that this latter work was double: but unto the first three he laid not his hand, neither for the first time, nor for the second time, nor for the third time. So to them he added3 that spiritual flame (for they were one, and ten, and fifty, thrice, and again) and that was the Beast, the Living One that is Lifan. Let us be silent, therefore, my brethren, worshipping the holy sixfold Ox4 that was our Father in his peace that he had won into, and that so hardly. For of this shall no man speak. Now therefore let it be spoken of our Father’s journeyings in the land of Vo5 and of his sufferin therein, and of the founding of our holy and illustrious Order.

He took with him his Son,2 a Lamb, Life, and Strength, for these four were the Keys of that Mountain. So by ten days and fifty days and two hundred days and yet ten days he went forth. After ten days fell a thunderbolt, whirling through black clouds of rain: after sixty the road split in two, but he travelled on both at once: after two hundred and sixty, the sun drove away the rain, and the Star shone in the day-time, making it Night. After the last day came his Mother, his Redeemer, and Himself ; and joining together they were even as I am who write unto you. Seventeen they were, the three Fathers : with the three Mothers they were thirty-two, and sixfold therein, being as countenance and countenance. Yet, being seventeen, they were but one, and that one none, as before hath been showed. And this enumera-tion is a great Mysterium of our art. Whence a light hidden in a Cross. Now therefore having brooded upon the ocean, and smitten with the Sword, and the Pyramid being builded in just proportion, was that Light fixed even in the Vault of the Caverns. With one stroke he rent asunder the Veil; with one stroke he closed the same. And entering the Sarcophagus of that Royal Tomb he laid him down to sleep. Four guarded him, and One in the four; Seven enwalled him, and One in the seven, yet were the seven ten, and One in the ten. Now therefore his disciples came unto the Vault of that Mystic Mountain, and with the Keys they opened the Portal and came to him and woke him. But during his long sleep the roses had grown over him, crimson and flaming with interior fire, so that he could not escape. Yet they withered at his glance ; withat he knew what fearful task was before him. But slaying his disciples with long Nails, he interred them there, so that they were right sorrowful in their hearts. May we all die so ! And what further befell him ye shall also know, but not at this time. Going forth of that Mountain he met also the Fool. Then the discourse of that Fool, my Brethren ; it shall repay your pains.

Forth he went along the dusty desert and met an antient woman bear-ing a bright crown of gold, studded with gems, one on each knee. Dressed in rags she was, and squatted clumsily on the sand. A horn grew from her forehead; and she spat black foam and froth. Foul was the hag and evil, yet our Father bowed down flat on his face to the earth. “Holy Virgin of God,” said he, “what dost thou here ? What wilt thou with thy servant ?” At that she stank so that the air gasped about her, like a fish brought out of the sea. So she told him she was gathering simples for her daughter that had died to bury her withal. Now no simples grew in the desert. Therefore our Father drew with his sword lines of power in the sand, so that a black and terrible demon appeared squeezing up in thin flat plates of flesh along the sword-lines. So our Father cried : “Simples, O Axcaxrabortharax, for my mother !” Then the demon was wroth and shrieked : “Thy mother to black hell ! She is mine !” So the old hag confessed straight that she had given her body for love to that fiend of the pit. But our Father paid no heed thereto and bade the demon to do his will, so that he brought him herbs many, and good, with which our Father planted a great grove that grew about him (for the sun was now waxen bitter hot) wherein he worshipped, offering in vessels of clay these seven offerings :2 The first offering, dust ; The second offering, ashes ; The third offering, sand ; The fourth offering, bay-leaves ; The fifth offering, gold ; The sixth offering, dung ; The seventh offering, poison. With the dust he gave a sickle to gather the harvest of that dust. With the ashes he gave a sceptre, that one might rule them aright. With the sand he gave a sword, to cut that sand withal. With the bay-leaves he ave a sun, to wither them With the gold he gave a garland of sores, and that was for luck. With the dung he gave a Rod of Life to quicken it. * [Thus in Collected Works.

Tredecim Voces. Ordinis In- ceptio.  Vitae. Viae. With the poison he gave also in offering a stage and a maiden. But about the noon came one shining unto our Father and gave him to drink from a dull and heavy bowl. And this was a liquor potent and heavy, by’r lady ! So that our Father sank into deep sleep and dreamed a dream, and in that mirific dream it seemed unto him that the walls of all things slid into and across each other, so that he feared greatly, for the stability of the universe is the great enemy; the unstable being the ever-lasting, saith Adhou Bim Aram, the Arab. O Elmen Zata, our Sophic Pilaster ! Further in the dream there was let down from heaven a mighty tessaract, bounded by eight cubes, whereon sat a mighty dolphin having eight senses. Further, he beheld a cavern full of most ancient bones of men, and therein a lion with the voice of a dog. Then came a voice: “Thirteen1 are they, who are one. Once is a oneness : twice is the Name: thrice let us say not : by four is the Son : by five is the Sword : by six is the Holy Oil of the most Excellent Beard, and the leaves of the Book are by six : by seven is that great Amen.” Then our Father saw one hundred and four horses that drove an ivory car over a sea of pearl, and they received him therein and bade him be comforted. With that he awoke and saw that he would have all his desire. In the morning therefore he arose and went his way into the desert. There he clomb an high rock and called forth the eagles, that their shadow floating over the desert should be as a book that men might read it. The shadows wrote and the sun recorded ; and on this wise cometh it to pass, O my Brethren, that by darkness and by sunlight ye will still learn ever these the Arcana of our Science. Lo ! who learneth by moonlight, he is the lucky one ! So our Father, having thus founded the Order, and our sacred Book being opened, rested awhile and beheld many wonders, the like of which were never yet told. But ever chiefly his study was to reduce unto eight things his many. And thus, O Brethren of our Venerable Order, he at last succeeded. Those who know not will learn little herein: yet that they may be shamed all shall be put forth at this time clearly before them all, with no obscurity nor obfuscation in the exposition thereof. Writing this, saith our Father to me, the Humblest and oldest of all his disciples, write as the story of my Quintessential Quest, my Spagyric Wandering, my Philosophical Going. Write plainly unto the Brethren, quoth he, for many be little and weak ; and thy hard words and much learning may confound them. Therefore I write thus plainly to you. Mark well that ye read me aright ! Our Father (blessed be his name !) entered the Path on this wise. He cut off three from ten :2 thus he left seven. He cut and left three: he cut and left one : he cut and became. Thus fourfold. Eightfold.3 He opened his eyes : he cleansed his heart: he chained his tongue : he fixed 1 Achad, unity, adds to thirteen.

Mark ye all : it is declared. Now of the last adventure of our Father and of his going into the land of Apes, that is, England, and of what he did there, it is not fitting that I, the poor fool who loved him, shall now dis- course. But it is most necessary that I should speak of his holy death and of his funeral and of the bruit thereof, for that is gone into diverse lands as a false and lying report, whereby much harm and ill-luck come to the Brethren. In this place, therefore, will I set down the exact truth of all that happened. In the year of the Great Passing Over were signs and wonders seen of all men, O my Brethren, as it is written, and well known unto this day. And the first sign was of dancing: for every woman that was under the moon began to dance and was mad, so that headlong and hot-mouthed she flung herself down, desirous. Whence the second sign, that of musical inventions ; for in that year, and of Rosewomen, came A and U and M,1 the mighty musicians ! And the third sign likewise, namely, of animals : for in that year every sheep had lambs thirteen, and every cart2 was delivered of a wheel ! And other wonders innumerable: they are well known, insomuch that that year is yet held notable. Now our Father, being very old, came into the venerable Grove of our August Fraternity and abode there. And so old was he and feeble that he could scarce lift his hands in benediction upon us. And all we waited about him, both by day and night; lest one word should fall, and we not hear the same. But he spake never unto us, though his lips moved and his eyes sought ever that which we could not see. At last, on the day of D., the mother of P.,3 he straightened himself up and spake. This his final discourse was written down then by the dying lions in their own blood, traced willingly on the desert sands about the Grove of the Illustrious. Also here set down : but who will confirm the same, let him seek it on the sands. Children of my Will, said our Father, from whose grey eyes fell gentlest tears, it is about the hour. The chariot (Ch.)4 is not, and the chariot (H.) is at hand. Yet I, who have been car-borne through the blue air by sphinxes, shall never be carried away, not by the whitest horses of the world. To you I have no word to say. All is written in the sacred Book. To that look ye well ! Ambrose, old friend, he said, turning to me—and I wept ever sore—do thou write for the little ones, the children of my children, for them that understand not easily our high Mysteries; for in thy pen is, as it were, a river of clear water ; without vagueness, without ambiguity, 1 Aum!

For, as for him that understandeth not thy writing, and that easily and well, be ye well assured all that he is a vile man and a losel of little worth or worship ; a dog, an unclean swine, a worm of filfth, a festering sore in the vitals of earth: such an one is liar and murderer, debauched, drunken, sexless and spatulate ; an ape-dropping, a lousy, flat-backed knave: from such an one keep ye well away ! Use hath he little : ornament maketh he nothing : let him be cast out on the dunghills beyond Jordan; let him pass into the S. P. P., and that utterly ! With that our Father sighed deep and laid back his reverend head, and was silent. But from his heart came a subtle voice of tenderest fare- well, so that we knew him well dead. But for seventy days and seventy nights we touched him not, but abode ever about him: and the smile changed not on his face, and the whole grove was filled with sweet and subtle perfumes. Now on the 71st day arose there a great dispute about his body ; for the angels and spirits and demons did contend about it, that they might possess it. But our eldest brother V. N. bade all be still ; and thus he apportioned the sacred relics of our Father. To the Angel Agbagal, the fore part of the skull ; To the demon Ozoz, the back left part of the skull ; To the demon Olcot,1 the back right part of the skull ; To ten thousand myriads of spirits of fire, each one hair ; To ten thousand myriads of spirits of water, each one hair; To ten thousand myriads of spirits of earth, each one hair ; To ten thousand myriads of spirits of air, each one hair ; To the archangel Zazelazel, the brain ; To the angel Usbusolat, the medulla ; To the demon Ululomis, the right nostril ; To the angel Opael, the left nostril ; To the spirit Kuiphiah, the membrane of the nose ; To the spirit Pugrah, the bridge of the nose ; To eleven thousand spirits of spirit, the hairs of the nose, one each ; To the archangel Tuphtuphtuphal, the right eye ; To the archdevil Upsusph, the left eye ; The parts thereof in trust to be divided among their servitors ; as the right cornea, to Aphlek ; the left, to Urnbal ;—mighty spirits are they, and bold !

As to his magical weapons, all vanished utterly at the moment of his Passing Over. Therefore they carried away our Father’s body piece by piece and that with reverence and in order, so that there was not left of all one hair, nor one nerve, nor one little pore of the skin. Thus was there no funeral pomp; they that say other are liars and blasphemers against a fame untarnished. May the red plague rot their vitals! Thus, O my Brethren, thus and not otherwise was the Passing Over of that Great and Wonderful Magician, our Father and Founder. May the dew of his admirable memory moisten the grass of our minds, that we may bring forth tender shoots of energy in the Great Work of Works. So mote it be!
