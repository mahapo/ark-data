The use of the Name is therefore to invoke one’s own imost secrecy, considered as the result of the conjunction of Nuit and Hadit.

That is, it is the Concealed Place; and this, since all things are in thine own Self, is the Unconscious.” Liber CXI (Aleph) cap. Ds. † But compare the use of the same word in Section C. ‡ See explanation in Point II."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"11 POINT II Ars Congressus Cum Dæmone Section A Let the Adept be standing in his circle on the square of Tiphareth,12 armed with his Wand and Cup; but let him perform the Ritual throughout in his body of Light. He may burn the Cakes of Light, or the Incense of Abramelin; he may be prepared by Liber CLXXV, the reading of Liber LXV, and by the practices of Yoga. He may invoke Hadit by “wine and strange drugs”* if he so will.† He prepares the circle by the usual formulæ of Banishing and Consecration, etc. He recites Section A as a rehearsal before His Holy Guardian Angel of the attributes of that Angel. Each phrase must be realized with full concentration of force, so as to make Samadhi as perfectly as possible on the truth proclaimed. Line 1 He identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, and the Kether thereof; one formulation of Hadit in the boundless Body of Nuit. Line 2, 3, 4 He asserts that His Angel has created (for the purpose of self-realization through projection in conditioned Form) three pairs of opposites: (a) the Fixed and the Volatile; (b) the Unmanifested and the Manifest; and (c) the Unmoved and the Moved. Otherwise, the Negative and the Positive in respect of Matter, Mind and Motion. Line 5 He acclaims his Angel as “Himself Made Perfect”; adding that this individuality is inscrutable and inviolable. In the Neophyte Ritual of G∴D∴ (as it is printed in Equinox I (2), for the old æon) the Hierophant is the perfected Osiris, who brings the candidate, the natural Osiris, to     * [See AL II, 22.] † Any such formula should be used only when the adept has full knowledge based on experience of such matters."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 12 identity with himself. But in the new Æon the Hierophant is Horus (Liber CCXX I, 49);* therefore the candidate will be Horus too.13 What then is the formula of the initiation of Horus? It will no longer be that of the Man, through Death. It will be the natural growth of the Child. His experiences will no more be regarded as catastrophic. Their hieroglyph is “The Fool”: the innocent and impotent Harpocrates Babe becomes the Horus Adult by obtaining the Wand. “De reine Thor” seizes the Sacred Lance.14 Bacchus becomes Pan. The Holy Guardian Angel is the Unconscious Creature Self—the Spiritual Phallus. It is therefore advisible to replace the name Asar Un-nefer by that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit at the outset, and by that of one’s own Holy Guardian Angel when it has been communicated. Line 6 He hails Him as BESZ, the Matter that destroys and devours Godhead, for the purpose of the Incarnation of any God. Line 7 He hails Him as APOPHRASZ, the Motion that destroys and devours Godhead, for the purpose of the Incarnation of any God. The combined action of these two DEVILS is to allow the God upon whom they prey to enter into the enjoyment of existence through the Sacrament of dividual “Life” (Bread—the flesh of BESZ) and “Love” (Wine—the blood or venom of APOPHRASZ). Line 8 He acclaims His Angel as having “eaten of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil”; otherwise, having become wise (in the Dyad, Chokmah) to apprehend the formula of Equilibrium which is now His own, being able to apply Himself accurately to His self-appointed environment.     * [“Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor Khuit hath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa the sufferer, Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating.”]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"POINT II 13 Line 9 He acclaims His Angel as having laid down the Law of Love as the Magical formula of the Universe, that He may resolve the phenomenal again into its noumenal phase by uniting any two opposites in ecstatic passion. Line 10 He acclaims His Angel as having appointed that this formula of Love should effect not only the dissolution of the separateness of the Lover into His own impersonal Godhead, but their co-ordination in a “Child” quint-essentialized from its parents to constitute a higher order of Being than their, so that each generation is an alchemical progress towards perfection in the direction of successive complexities. As Line 9 asserts Involution, Line 10 asserts Evolution. Line 11 He acclaims His Angel as having devised this method of self-realization; the object of Incarnation is to obtain articulate apprehension of the soul by measuring its reactions to its relations with other incarnated Beings, and to observe theirs with each other. Section Aa Line 1 The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious com-munication with His Angel, on the ground that that Angel has Himself taught him the Secret Magick by which he may make the proper link. “Mosheh” is MH, the formation, in Jechidah, Chiah, Neschamah, Ruach—the Sephiroth from Kether to Yesod—since 45 is S1–9 which Sh, 300, is S1–24, which superadds to these Nine an extra Fifteen numbers. (See in Liber D the meanings and correspondences of 9, 15, 24, 45, 300, 345).15  45 is moreover ADM, man. “Mosheh” is thus the name of man as a God-concealing form. But in the Ritual let the Adept replace this “Mosheh” by his own motto as Adeptus Minor. For “Ishrael” let him prefer his own Magical Race, according to the obligations of his Oaths to Our Holy Order!16 (The Beast 666 Himself used “Ankh-f-n-khonsu” and “Khem” in this section.)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 14 Line 2 The Adept reminds His Angel that He has created That One Substance of which Hermes hath written in the Table of Emerald, whose virtue is to unite in itself all opposite modes of Being, thereby to serve as a Talisman charged with the Spiritual Energy of Existence, an Elixir or Stone composed of the physical basis of Life. This Commemo-ration is placed between the two personal appeals to the Angel, as if to claim privilege to partake of this Eucharist which cre-ateth, sustaineth and redeemeth all things. Line 3 He now asserts that he is himself the “Angel” or messenger of his Angel; that is, he is a mind and body whose office is to receive and transmit the Word of his Angel. He hails his Angel not only as “un-nefer,” the Perfection of “Asar” himself as a man, but as Ptah-Apophrasz-Ra, the identity (Hadit) wrapped in the Dragon (Nuit) and thereby manifested as a Sun (Ra-Hoor-Khuit). The “Egg” (or Heart) “girst with a Serpent” is a cognate symbol; the idea is thus expressed later in the ritual. (See Liber LXV, which expands this to the utmost.) Section B The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the Sections now following, B to Gg. He is to travel astrally around the circle, making the appropriate pentagrams, sigils and signs. His direction is widdershins.17 He thus makes three curves, each covering three-fourths of the circle.18 He should give the Sign of the Enterer on passing the Kiblah, or Direction of Boleskine.19 This picks up the Force naturally radiating from that point,* and projects it in the direction of the path of the Magician. The sigils are those given in The Equinox I (7), Plate X outside the square;20 the signs those shewn in Vol. I no. 2, Plate “The Signs of the Grades.”21 In these invocations he should expand his girth and his stature to     * This is an assumption based on Liber Legis II, 78 and III, 34."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"POINT II 15 the utmost,* assuming the form and the consciousness of the Elemental God of the quarter. After this, he begins to vibrate the “Barbarous Names” of the Ritual. Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost with the force of the Names; but let him formulate his Will, understood thoroughly as the dynamic aspect of his Creative Self, in an appearance symbolically apt, I say not in the form of a Ray of Light, of a Fiery Sword, or of aught save that bodily Vehicle of the Holy Ghost which is sacred to BAPHOMET,22 by its virtue that concealeth the Lion and the Serpent that His Image may appear adorably upon the Earth for ever. Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in this imagined Shape, and let it radiate with th eLight proper to the Element invoked, and let each Word issue along the Shaft with passionate impulse, as if its Voice gave command thereto that it should thrust itself leapingly forward. Let also each Word accumulate authority, so that the Head of the Shaft may plunge twice as far for the Second Word as for the First, and Four Times for the Third as for the Second, and thus to the end. Moreover, let the Adept fling forth his whole consciousness thither. Then at the final wWord, let him bring rushing back his Will within himself, steadily streaming, and let him offer himself to its point, as Artemis to Pan, that this perfectly pure concentration of the Element purge him thoroughly, and possess him with its passion. In this Sacrament being wholly at one with that Element, let the Adept utter the Charge “Hear Me, and make,” etc., with strong sense that this unity with that quarter of the Universe confers upon him the fullest freedom and privilege appurtenant thereto.     * Having experience of success in the practices of Liber DXXXVI, Batracofreno-bookosmomacia."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 16 Let the Adept take note of the wording of the Charge. The “Firmament” is the Ruach, the “mental plane”: it is the realm of Shu, or Zeus, where revolves the Wheel of the Gunas, the Three Forms* of Being. The Æthyr is the “Akasa”, the “Spirit,” the Æthyr of physics, which is the framework on which all forms are founded; it receives, records and transmits all impulses without itself suffering mutation thereby. The “Earth” is the sphere wherein the operation of these “fundamental” and æthyric forces appears to perception. “Under the Earth” is the world of those phenomena which inform those perceived projections,     * They correspond to the Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt of Alchemy; to Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas in the Hindu system; and are rather modes of action than actual qualities even when conceived as latent. They are the apparatus of communication between the planes; as such, they are conventions. There is no absolute validity in any means of mental apprehension; but unless we make these spirits of the Firmament subject unto us by establishing right relations (within the proper limits) with the Universe, we shall fall into error when we develop our new instrument of direct understanding. It is vital that the Adept should train his intellectual faculties to tell him the truth, in the measure of their capacity. To despise the mind on account of its limitations is the most disastrous blunder; it is the common cause of the calamities which strew so many shores with the wreckage of the Mystic Armada. Bigotry, Arrogance, Bewilderment, all forms of mental and moral disorder, so often observed in people of great spiritual attainment, have brought the Path itself into discredit; almost all such catastrophes are due to trying to build the Temple of the Spirit without proper attention to the mental laws of structrue and the physical necessities of freedom. The mind must be brought to its utmost pitch of perfection, but according to its own internal properties; one cannot feet a microscope on mutton chops. It must be regarded as a mechanical instrument of knowledge, independent of the personality of its possessor. One must treat it exactly as one treats one’s electroscope or one’s eyes; one must guard against the danger of disturbance due to the influence of one’s wishes. A physician calls in a colleage to attend his own family, knowing that personal anxiety may derange his judgement. A microscopist who trusts his eyes when his pet theory is at stake may falsify the facts, and find too late that he has made a fool of himself. In the case of initiation itself, history is scarred with the would inflicted by this Dagger. It reminds us constantly of the danger of relying upon the intellectual faculties. A judge must know the law in every point, and be detached from personal prejudices, and incorruptible, or iniquity will triumph. Dogma, with persecution, delusion, paralysis of progress, and many another evil, as its satraps, has always establsihed a tyranny when Genius has proclaimed it. Islam making a bonfire of written Wisdom, and Haeckel forging biological evidence; physicists ignorant of radioactivity disputing the conclusions of geology, and theologicans impatient of truth struggling against the tide of thought; all such must perish at the hands of their own error in making their minds, internally defective or externally deflected, the measure of the Universe."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"POINT II 17 and determine their particular character. “Dry land” is the place of dead “material things,” dry (i.e. unknowable) because unable to act on our minds. “Water” is the vehicle whereby we feel such things; “air” their menstruum wherein these feelings are mentally appre-hended. It is called “whirling” because of the instability of thought, and the fatuity of reason, on which we are yet dependent for what we call “life.” “Rushing Fire” is the world in which wandering thought burns up to swift-darting Will. These four stages explain how the non-Ego is transmuted into the Ego. A “Spell” of God is any form of consciousness, and a “Scourge” any form of action. The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control of every detail of the Universe which His Angel has created as ameans of manifesting Himself to Himself. It covers command of the primary projection of the Possible in individuality, in the antithetical artifice which is the device of Mind, and in a balanced triplicity of modes or states of being, whose combinations constitute the characteristics of Cosmos. It includes also a standard of structure, a rigidity to make reference possible. Upon these foundations of condition, which are not things in themselves, but the canon or code to which things conform, is builded the Temple of Being, whose materials are themselves perfects mysterious, inscrutable as the Soul, and like the Soul imagining themselves by symbols which we may feel, perceive, and adapt to our use without ever knowing the whole Truth about them. The Adept sums up all these items by claiming authority over every form of expression possible to Existence, whether it be a “spell” (idea) or a “scourge” (act) of “God,” that is, of himself. The Adept must accept every “spirit,” every “spell,” every “scourge,” as part of his environment, and make them all “subject to” himself; that is, consider them as contributory causes of himsef. They have made him"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 18 what he is. They correspond exactly to his own faculties. They are all—ultimately—of equal importance. The fact that he is what he is proves that each item is equilibrated. The impact of each new impression affects the entire system in due measure. He must therefore realize that every event is subject to him. It occurs because he had need of it. Iron rusts because the molecules demand oxygen for the satisfaction of their tendencies. They do not crave hydrogen; therefore combination with that gas is an event which does not happen. All experiences contribute to make us complete in ourselves. We feel ourselves subject to them so long as we fail to recognize this: when we do, we perceive that they are subject to us. And whenever we strive to evade an experience, whatever it may be, we thereby do wrong to ourselves. We thwart our own tendencies. To live is to change; and to oppose change is to revolt against the law which we have enacted to govern our lives. To resent destiny is thus to abdicate our sovereignty, and to invoke death. Indeed, we have decreed the doom of death every breach of the law of life. And every failure to incorporate any impression starves the particular faculty which stood in need of it. This Section B invokes Air in the East, with a Shaft of golden glory. Section C The Adept now invokes Fire in the South; flame-red are the rays that burst from his verendum.* Section D He invokes Water in the West, his Wand billowing forth blue radiance.     * [Lat., lit. “thing to be feared”; a term used for Levi (Rituel de Haute Magie, cap. VII) for the Magic Wand (“to which, however, an allegorical significance may perhaps be attributed” – Waite, Book of Ceremonial Magic).]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"POINT II 19 Section E He goes to the North to invoke Earth; flowers of green flame flash forth from his his weapon. As practice makes the Adept perfect in this Work, it becomes automatic to attach all these complicated ideas and intentions to their correlated words and acts. When this is attained, he may go deeper into the formula by amplifying its correspondences. Thus, he make invoke Water in the manner of water, extending his Will with majestic and irresistable motion, midnful of its impulse gravitation, yet with a suave and tranquil appearance of weakness. Again, he may apply the formula of Water to its peculiar purpose as it surges back into his sphere, using it with conscious skill for the cleansing and calming of the receptive and emotional elements in his character, and for the solution or sweeping-away of those tangled weeds of prejudice which hamper him from freedom to act as he will. Similar applications of the remaining invocations will occur to the Adept who is ready to use them. Section F The Adept now returns to the Tiphareth square of his Tau, and invokes Spirit, facing towards Boleskine, by the active Pentagrams, the sigil called The Mark of the Beast,23 and the Signs of L.V.X. (See plate as before.) He then vibrates the Names extending his Will in the same way as before, but vertically upward. At the same time he expands the Source of that Will—the secret symbol of self—both about him and below, as if to affirm that Self, duplex as is its form, reluctant to acquiesce in its failure to coincide with the Sphere of Nuit. Let him now imagine, at the last Word, that the Head of his Will, where his consciousness is fixed, opens its fissure (the Brahmarandhra Cakkra, at the juncture of the cranial sutres) and exudes a drop of clear crystalline dew, and"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 20 that this pearl is his Soul, a virgin offering to his Angel, pressed forth from his being by the intensity of his Aspiration. Section Ff With these words the Adept does not withdraw his Will within him as in the previous sections. He thinks of them as a reflection of Truth on the surface of the dew, where his Soul hides trembling. He takes them to be the first formulation in his consciousness of the nature of His Holy Guardian Angel. Line 1 The “Gods” include all the conscious elements of his nature. Line 2 The “Universe” includes all possible phenomena of which he can be aware. Line 3 The “Winds” are his thoughts, which have prevented him from attaining to his Angel. Line 4 His Angel has made “Voice,” the magical weapon which produces “Words,” and these words have been the Wisdom by which He hath created all things.24 The “Voice” is necessary as the link between the Adept and his Angel. The Angel is “king,” the One who “can,” the “source of authority and the fount of honour”; also the King (or King’s Son) who delivers the Enchanted Princess and makes her his Queen. He is “Ruler,” the “unconscious will”; to be thwarted no more by the ignorant and capricious false will of the conscious man. And He is “Helper,” the author of the infallible impulse that sends the Soul sweeping along the skies on its proper path with such impetus that the attraction of alien orbs is no longer sufficient to swerve it. The “Hear Me” clause is now uttered by the normal human consciousness, withdrawn to the physical body: the Adept must deliberately abandon his attainment, because it is not yet his whole being which burns up before the Beloved.

He now repeats the signs as before, save that he makes the Passive Invoking Pentagram of Spirit. He concentrates his consciousness within his Twin-Symbol of Self, and endeavours to send it to sleep. But if the Operation be performed properly, his Angel shall have accepted the offering of Dew, and seized with fervour upon the extended symbol of Will towards Himself. This then shall He shake vehemently with vibrations of love reveraberating with the Words of the Section. Even in the physical ears of the Adept there shall resound an echo thereof, yet he shall not be able to describe it. It shall seem both louder than thunder, and softer than the whisper of the night-wind. It shall at once be inarticulate, and mean more than he hath ever heard. Now let him strive with all the strength of his Soul to withstand the Will of his Angel, concealing himself in the closest cell of the citadel of consciousness. Let him consecrate himself to resist the assault of the Voice and the Vibration until his consciousness faint away into Nothing. For if there abide unabsorbed even one single atom of the false Ego, that atom should stain the virginity of the True Self, and profane the Oath; then that atom should be so inflamed by the approach of the Angel that it should overwhelm the rest of the mind, tyrannize over it, and become an insane despot to the total ruin of the realm. But, all being dead to sense, who then is able to strive against the Angel? He shall intensify the stress of His Spirit so that His loyal legions of Lion-Serpents leap from the ambush, awakening the Adept to witness their Will and sweep him with them in their enthusiasm, so that he consciously partakes their purpose, and sees in its simplicity the solution to all his perplexities.

This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost always; and also in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupendous and sublime in all cases, though its character may vary within wide limits.* The spate of stars shoots from the head of the Will-symbol, and is scattered over the sky in glittering galaxies. This dispersion destroys the concentration of the Adept, whose mind cannot master such multiplicity of majesty: as a rule, he simply sinks stunned into normality, to recall nothing of his experience but a vague though vivid impression of complete release and ineffable rapture. Repetition fortifies him to realize the nature of his attainement: and his Angel, the link once made, requents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive to His Holy presence and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after repeated success, that the Adept is not flung back into his mortality by the explosion of the Star-spate, but identified with one particular “Lion-Serpent,” continuing conscious thereof until it finds its proper place in Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a Truth, which the Adept may then take back to earth with him. This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to establish the relation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that the Adept is aware that his Angel is the Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements of his Self, that his normal consciousness contains alien enemies induced by the accidents of environment, and that this Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys all doubts and     * These phenomena are not wholly subjective; they may be perceived, though often under other forms, by even the ordinary man."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"POINT II 23 delusions, confers all blessings, teaches all Truth, and contains all delights.

Section Gg The Adept should have realized that his Act of Union with the Angel implies (1) the death of his old mind save insofar as his unconscious elements preserve its memory when they absorb it, and (2) the death of his unconscious elements themselves. But their death is rather a going forth to renew their life through love. He then, by con-scious comprehension of them separately and together, becomes the “Angel” of his Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voice is Thunder. Thus in this Section the Adept utters articulately, so far as words may, what his Angel is to Himself. He says this, with his scin-læca wholly withdrawn into his physical body; constraining his Angel to indwell his heart. Line 1 “I am He” asserts the destruction of the sense of separate-ness between self and Self. It affirms existence, but of the third person only. “The Bornless Spirit” is free of all space, “having sight in the feet,” that they may choose their own path.25 “Strong” is GBR, the Magician escorted by the Sun and the Moon (see Liber D and Liber 777). “The Immortal Fire” is the creative Self; impersonal energy cannot perish, no matter what forms it assumes.

Thus, an"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 24 hyperbola is a simple idea, but its construction exacts two curves. Line 3 The Angel, as the Adept knows him, is a being in Tiphareth, which obscures Kether. The Adept is not officially aware of the higher Sephiroth. He cannot perceive, like the Ipsissimus, that all things soever are equally illusion and equally Absolute. He is in Tiphareth, whose office is Redemption, and he deplores the events which have cause the apparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped. He is also aware, even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits and defects of his Attainment.26 Line 4 This refers to the phenomena which accompany his attainenment. Line 5 This means the recognition of the Angel as the True Self of his subconscious Self, the hidden Life of his physical life. Line 6 The Adept realizes every breath, every word of his Angel as charged with creative fire. Tiphareth is the Sun, and the Angel is the spiritual Sun of the Soul of the Adept. Line 7 Here is summed the entire process of bringing the conditioned Universe to knowledge of itself through the formula of generation;* a soul implants itself in sense-hoodwinked body and reason-fettered mind, makes them aware of their Inmate, and thus to partake of its own consciousness of the Light.

Nor should he omit to keep his Body of Light in close touch with the phenomena of its own plane, so that its privy consciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting his scattered ideas from obsession. But he should have acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of detatching these elements of his consciousness from their articulate centre, so that they become (temporarily) independent responsible units, capable of receiving communications from headquarters at will, but perfectly able (1) to take care of themselves without troubling their chief, and (2) to report to him at the proper time. In a figure, they must be like subordinate officers, expected to display self-reliance, initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of the Day. The Adept should therefore be able to rely on these individual minds of his to control their own conditions without interference from himself for the time required, and to recall them in due course, receiving an accurate report of their adventures. This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest Self, that part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs that has prevented him from perceiving that Soul. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 30 The effect of the Ritual has been (a) to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him; (b) to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths; (c) to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anæsthetize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of spiritual vivisection,33 just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen out the intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire; (d) to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and fling them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel, and (e) to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes Him. The method of the Ritual is thus manifold. There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to calculate his course of action. He can decide what must be banished, what purified, what concentrated.* He can then concentrate his will upon its one essential element, overcoming its resistance—which is automatic, like a physiological reflex—by destroying inhibitions through his ego-overwhelming enthusiasm.† The other half of the work needs no such compex effort; for his Angel is simple and unperplexed, ready at all times to respond to rightly-ordered approach.     * [qy. “consecrated”] † A high degree of initiation is required. This means that the process of analysis must have been carried out very thoroughly. The Adept must have become aware of his deepest impulses, and understood their true significance. The “resistance” here mentioned is automatic; it increases indefinitely against direct pressure. It is useless to try to force onself in these matters; the uninitiated Aspirant, however eager he may be, is sure to fail. One must know how to deal with each internal idea as it arises. It is impossible to overcome one’s inhibitions by conscious effort; their existence justifies them. God is on their side, as on that of the victim in Browning’s Instans Tyrannus. A man cannot compel himself to love, however much he may want to, on various rational grounds. But on the other hand, when the true impulse comes, it overwhelms all its critics; they are powerless either to make or break a genius; it can only testifyt tot the fact that it has met its master."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"POINT III 31 But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid description. One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the Adept need not retain any memory soever of what has occurred. He may be merely aware of a gap in his conscious life, and judge of its contents by observing that his nature has been subtly transfigured. Such an experience might indeed be the proof of perfection. If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel, it must be that some part of his mind is prepared to realize the rapture, and to express it to itself in one way or another. This involves the perfection of that part, its freedom from prejudice and the limitations of ration-ality so-called. For instance, one could not receive the illumination as to the nature of life which the doctrine of Evolution should shed, if one is passionately persuaded that humanity is essentially not animal, or convinced that causality is repugnant to reason. The Adept must be ready for the utter destruction of his point-of-view on any subject, and even that of his innate conception of the forms and laws of thought.* Thus, he may find that his Angel considers his “business” or his “love” to be absurd trifles; also that human ideas of “time” are invalid, and human “laws” of logic applicable only to the relations between illusions. Now, the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is sensitive to His influence. Such a point will naturally be one that is salient in the Adept’s character, and also one that is, in the proper sense of the word, pure.† Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty, is likely to receive a visual impression of his Angel in a physical form which is sublimely quintessiantial of his ideal. A musician may be rapt away by majestic melodies such as he never hoped to hear. A philosopher     * Of course, even false tenets and modes of the mind are in one sense true. It is only their appearance which alters. Copernicus did not destroy the facts of nature, or change the instruments of observation. He merely effected a radical simplification of science. Error is really a “fool’s knot.” Moreover, the very tendency responsible for the entanglement is one of the necessary elements of the situation. Nothing is “wrong” in the end; and one cannot reach the “right” point of view without the aid of one’s particular “wrong” point. If we reject or alter the negative of a photograph we shall not get a perfect positive. † This means, free from ideas, however excellent in themselves, which are foreign to it. For instance, literary interest has no proper place in a picture."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 32 may attain apprehension of tremendous truths, the solution of problems that had baffled him all his life. Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illuminations experienced by simple-minded men, such as a workman who “saw God” and likened Him to “a quantity of little pears.” Again, we know that ecstasy, impinging upon unbalanced minds, inflames the idolized idea, and produces fanatical faith fierce even to frenzy, with intolerance and insanely disordered energy which is yet so powerful as to affect* the destinies of empires. But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel are a side issue; the essence of the Union is the intimacy. This intimacy (or rather, identity) is independent of all partial forms of expression; at its best it is therefore as inarticulate as Love is. The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or a cry, some nature physical gesture of animal sympathy spasm. This is to be criticized as incomplete self-control. Silence is nobler. In any case, the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that his Soul is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms of intellect. It is evident that the stress of such spiritual possession must tend to overwhelm the soul, especially at first. It actually suffers from the excess of its ecstasy, just as extreme love produces vertigo. The soul sinks and swoons. Such weakness is fatal alike to its enjoyment and its apprehension: “be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy”† sayeth The Book of the Law.‡ The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing himself, to harden his soul. To this end, I The Beast have made trial and proof of divers devices. Of these the most potents is to set the body to strive with the soul.

But lest such muttering tend to disturb communiion with the Angel, speak only His Name. Until the Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perfect possession of his Belovéd. His most important task is thus to open his ears to the voice of his Angel, that he may know Him, how He is called. For hearken! this Name, understood rightly and fully, declareth the nature of the Angel in every point, wherefore also that Name is the formula of the perfection to which the Adept must aspire, and also of the power of Magick by virtue whereof he must work. He then that is as yet ignorant of the Name, let him repeat a Word worthy of this particular Ritual. Such are ABRAHADABRA, the Word of the Æon, which signifieth “The Great Work Accom-plished”; and AUMGN, already interpreted in this book;* and the name of THE BEAST, for that His number showeth forth this Union with the Angel, and His Work is no other than to make all men partakers of this Mystery of the Mysteries of Magick. So then, saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel and withstand Him,34 that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in communication until the consciousness becomes capable of clear comprehension, and of accurate transmission† of the transcendent Truth of the Belovéd to the heart that holds Him. The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to maintain the state of Union for several minutes, even at first.     * The essence of this matter is that the word AUM, which expresses the course of Breath (spiritual life) from free utterance through controlled concentration to Silence, is transmuted by the creation of the compound letter MGN to replace M: that is, Silence is realized as passing into continuous ecstatic vibration, of the nature of “Love” under “will” as shewn by MGN = 40 + 3 + 50 = 93 = AGAPH = QELHMA, etc.; and the whole word has the value of 100, Perfection Perfected, the Unity in completion, and equivalent to KF [sic., s.b.

VII, s. v.] † The “normal” intellect is incapable of these functions; a superior faculty must have been developed. As Zoroaster says: “Extend the void mind of thy soul to that Intelligible, that thou mayst learn the Intelligible, because it subsistith beyond Mind. Thou wilt not understand It as when understanding some common thing.” [Chaldæan Oracles, part of fragment 166 and fragment 167 in Westcott edition.]"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH 34 In any case, he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather as an encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. He should increase his efforts. Let him beware of the “lust of result,” of expecting too much, of losing courage if his first success is followed by a series of failures. For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create an inhibition fatal to subsequent attempts. One fears to fail; the fear intrudes upon the concentration, and so fulfils its own prophecy. We know how too much pleasure in a love affair makes one afraid to disgrace oneself on the next few occasions; indeed, until familiarity has accustomed one to the idea that one’s lover has never supposed one to be more than human. Confidence returns gradually. Inarticulate ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoyment of the elements of the fascination. Just so one’s first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one continues to gaze, to the appreciation of exquisite details of the view. At first they were blurred by the blinding rush of general beauty; they emerge one by one as the shock subsides, and passionate rapture yields to intelligent interest. In the same way the Adept almost always begins by torrential lyrics extravagences about “ineffable love,” “unimaginable bliss,” “inexpressible infinities of illimitable utterness.”* He usually loses his sense of proportion, of humour, of reality, and of sound judge-ment. His ego is often inflated to the bursting point, till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were not so pitifully dangerous to himself and others. He also tends to take his new-found “truths of illlumin-ation” for the entire body of truth, and insists that they must be as valid and vital for all men as they happen to be for himself.35 It is wise to keep silence about those things “unlawful to utter” which one may have heard “in the seventh heaven.”36 This may not apply to the sixth.

He must give time a chance to redress his balance, sore shaken by the impact of the Infinite. As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find his passionate ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligibility which adds power, while it informs and fortifies his mental and moral qualities instead of obscuring and upsetting them. He will by now have become able to converse with his Angel, impossible as it once seemed; for he now knows that the storm of souund which he supposed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions. The “infinity” nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly beyond his limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only call them “many.” The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of the Adept, is perfectly definite and precise. It does not deal in ambiguities and abstractions. It possesses form, and confesses law; in exactly the same manner and degree as any other body of truth. IT is to the truth of the material and intellectual spheres of man very much what the Mathematics of Philosophy with its “infintite series” and “Cantorian continuity” is to schoolboy arithmetic. Each implies the other, though by that one may may explore the essential nature of existence and by this a pawnbroker’s profits. This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole operation, to assimilate himself to his Angel by continual conscious communion. For his Angel is an intelligible image of his own true Will, to do which is the whole of the law of his Being. Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphareth, which is the heart of the Ruach, and thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind. It is also directly inspired from Kether, the ultimate Self, through the Path of “The High Priestess,” or initiated intuition. Hence the Angel is in truth the logos or articulate expression of the whole being of the Adept, so that as he increases in the perfect understanding of His Name, he approaches the solution of the ultimate problem, what he himself truly is.

And if it be in a town, the room shall have no window, and if it be in the country, then it is better if the window be in the roof. Or, if it be possible, let this invocation be performed in a temple prepared for the ritual of passing through the Tuat.37 From the roof he shall hang a lamp, wherein is a red glass, to burn olive oil. And this lamp shall he cleanse and make ready after the prayer of sunset, and beneath the lamp shall be an altar, foursuqare, and the height shall be thrice half the breadth or double the breadth. And upon the altar shall be a censer, hemispherical, supported upon three legs of silver, and within it an hemisphere of copper, and upon the top a grating of gilder silver, and thereupon shall he burn incense made of four parts of olibanum and two parts of stacte,38 and one part of lignum aloes, or of cedar, or of sandal. And this is enough. And he shall also keep ready in a flask of crystal within the altar, holy anointing oil made of myrrh and cinnamon and galangal.39 And even if he be of higher rank than a Probationer, he shall yet wear the robe of the Probationer, for the star of flame showeth forth Ra-Hoor-Khuit openly upon the breast, and secretly the blue triangle that descendeth is Nuit, and the red triangle that ascendeth is Hadit.

Lond. 46, a.k.a. PGM V). The original is titled “Stele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist (or “Painter”)” (Sthlh tou 'Ieou tou zwgrafou); it is also popularly known as the “Headless One” or “Bornless One” ritual, although the Headless One or Headless Daimon (Ð ¢kefaloj daimon) is also invoked in a number of other extant Greek magical papyri. A transcription and English translation of London Papyrus 46 was published in 1852 by Charles Wycliffe Godwin (Fragment of a Græco-Egyptian Work upon Magic). A modern English translation by D.E. Aune can be found in Betz (ed.), The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation. An intermediate version of the ritual was worked up by someone, possibly Allan Bennet, perhaps based on Godwin’s publication, and published under the title “Preliminary Invocation” at the start of an edition of the Goëtia (a 17th-century English ritual of Evocation, composited from various Renaissance works on magick) issued by Crowley in 1904. From this publication the ritual is sometimes cited as the “Preliminary Invocation of the Goëtia” although its only connection with the Goëtia derives from that publication (and possibly from private magical work by Crowley, Bennet and others in which the two were combined). There is no evidence that the “Bornless One” ritual in itself was an official G.D. paper; it may have been, but the evidence normally adduced for this proposition, the “Bornless Ritual for the Invocation of the Higher Genius” printed by Israel Regardie in vol. III of The Golden Dawn, was compiled by Regardie himself from the versions published by Crowley, incorporating elements of other G.D. rituals, as Regardie himself clearly stated in his Ceremonial Magic. According to his diaries published in Equinox vol. I, Crowley used this ritual for various purposes in private magical work between 1901 and 1906, most notably the extended series of “Augoeides Invocations” of 1906 (see “The Temple of Solomon the King” in Equinox I (8)), by which point he had already worked out the basics of the method: The preamble: he makes a general concentration of all his magical forces, and a declaration of his will. The Ar Thiao section. He travels to the infinite East among the hosts of angels summoned by the words. A sort of “Rising on the Planes,” but in a horizontal direction. The same remarks apply to the next three sections in the other quarters."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES 45 At the great invocation following he extends the Shivalingam to infinite height, each letter of each word representing an exaltation of it by geometrical progression. Having seen this satisfactorily, he prostrates himself in adoration. When consciousness begins to return, he uses the final formula to raise that consciousness in the Shivalingam, springing to his feet at the moment of uniting himself with it, and lastly uttering that supreme song of the Initiate beginning: “I am He, the Borneless Spirit, having light in the feet; strong, and the Immortal Fire!” (Thus performed, the Invocation means about half an hour of the most intense magical work imaginable—a minute of it would represent the equivalent of about twelve hours of Asana.) (Crowley, “The Temple of Solomon the King”, Equinox I (8), pp. 18-19) Copious MS annotations to the “Preliminary Invocation” are extant, in (a) Crowley’s personal vellum copy of the Goëtia and (b) a copy of the regular edition into which Gerald Yorke transcribed notes from (a) and one or more other annotated copies. Facsimiles of the annotated versions were published in the 1993 First Impressions edition of the Goëtia, and the annotations transcribed in the 1995 Weiser “second edition,” as well as the electronic edition produced by Celephaïs Press (online at http://www.geocities.com/tanzendstern93/library.html). Many of the ideas represented in said notes were incorporated into Liber Samekh. In the “Præmonstrance of A∴A∴” in Equinox III (1), we find listed among the forthcoming official publications: LIBER CCCLXV. THE PRELIMINARY INVOCATION OF THE GOETIA so-called, with a complete explanation of the barbarous names of evocation used therein, and the secret rubrick of the ritual, by the Master Therion. This is the most potent invocation extant, and was used by the Master Himself in his attainment. 365 might have been chosen as the number of ABRASAX. The same description appeared in the list of “Official Publications of A∴A∴” in Appendix I of Magick in Theory and Practice, but the number was given there as “LIBER CCCLXV vel CXX.” The latter numeration (120 = ]ms, Samekh “in full”) was applied by Crowley during work on the ritual circa 1920, and had been previously referred to another Class D ritual of A∴A∴, “Liber Cadavaris” (the Zelator initiation), in the latter case for reasons of “Rosicrucian Symbolism.” The number under which Samekh actually appeared in MTP, 800, was also assigned to an earlier work, The Ship, a mystery play published in Equinox I (10). In both instances the reference is probably to ctq, Qetesh, a bow and the three paths from Malkuth, from the centre of which Samekh, the Path of the Arrow, ascends. 800 is also, or so we are assured by the illustrious editor of the “Blue Brick” edition of Magick, the number of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH & LIBER VIII 46 “Samekh final”, an otherwise unknown Hebrew letter-form, but this it would seem is a mystery reserved for Initiates of a grade beyond that of the present transcriber. Frater Progradior (Lat. “I advance”) was Frank Bennett, an A∴A∴ member and also sometime head of the Australian section of the O.T.O. under Crowley, who was resident at the Abbey of Thelema in the summer of 1921 e.v. The text of Liber Samekh has been transcribed from the corrected edition in the 1994 edition of Magick: Book 4 parts I-IV. In Point I, three long parenthetical remarks which were originally embedded in glosses on words (to BAS-AUMGN in section F and GAIA and AEPE in section G) have been moved to footnotes for the sake of readability. The “Appendix” is an addition by the present editor; it was transcribed from the 1973 reprint of Papyri Græcæ Magicæ, edited by Karl Preisendanz (PGM V:96-172). A number of transcription errors in voces magica occurred in the version that went into the Goëtia, and were perpetuated in Samekh. The Greek text contains a few conjectural restorations (of damaged places in the MS; flagged by angle brackets) and corrections by Preisendanz, e.g. ARBAQIAW for AR . . QIAW, IABAWQ IAW for IB . . QIAW, `AGIE (‘holy’) for APE, etc. The Godwin transcription was reprinted in the 1994 “Blue Brick”, the 1995 Weiser edition of the Goëtia and Regardie’s Ceremonial Magic; the latter also includes Godwin’s translation. Liber VIII This is an excerpt from the Eighth Æthyr of Liber CDXVIII, The Vision and the Voice. Neither the printed text in Equinox I (5) nor Crowley’s commentary as published in Equinox IV (2) clearly delinate it, but the portion extracted here seems as good a demarcation as any. In the version of “Liber VIII” printed in Equinox IV (1), two additional paragraphs before and after the section here given were also included (comprising the remainder of the speech in which the portion here given is embedded). Later on in this vision the speaker identifies himself as Aiwass, who by that time Crowley had identified as his own HGA. The lengthy sub-title combines two references to this text in Liber XIII, “Graduum Montis Abiegni.” This extract is identified as Liber VIII in Class D in the “Syllabus of the Official Instructions of the A∴A∴” in Equinox I (10), the number assigned on the grounds that “[the] Tarot card numbered 8, the Charioteer, the bearer of the Holy Graal, represents the Holy Guardian Angel.” "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"47 WORKS CITED A.

BESZ (Bec[) is a Coptic spelling of the dwarf-god Bes, as employed in the Golden Dawn, where for some inexplicable reason he had become one of the three elements making up the “Evil Persona” and was described as the “Brutal Power of Demonic Force” (I am unaware of any evidence for Bes being regarded as a demonic or malignant power in Egypt) Oddly, in some of the Græco-Egyptian magical papyri, Bes is identified with the Headless One. 3 The Goëtia version has “Iapos” ('Iapoj). APOPHRASZ (Apovrac[) is a Coptic spelling of Apep (Hellenised as Apophis), the monster-serpent of Egyptian myth; in the G.D. Z documents, another element of the Evil Persona, dubbed the “Stooping Dragon” (the third part of the Evil Person was Set-Typhon; while not explicitly cited, the opening of section C is almost identically worded in the original Greek to the opening of an invocation of Set-Typhon in the Demotic and Greek magical papyrus of London and Leiden). 4 The Goëtia version has “Mosheh” (Mousej in the original Greek). “Ankh-f- n-Khonsu” was a Theban priest of the 25th Dynasty whom Crowley claimed as a previous incarnation after discovering his funary stélé as exhibit no. 666 in the Cairo Museum in March 1904 (see The Equinox of the Gods). See also Crowley’s remarks on this line in Point II. 5 i.e. Egypt. The Goëtia version has “Ishrael” ('Istrael in the original Greek); similarly in line 3. See also Crowley’s remarks on this line in Point II. 6 The Goëtia version has “Paphro Osorronophris” (Fapro 'Osoronnwfrij in the original Greek, probably meant for “Pharoah Asar un-Nefer”). 7 With a couple of exceptions (FF for UU in section G), F renders letters which were originally omega, long ‘o.’ The substitution, one suspects, was made for Qabalistic reasons. The letter digamma (#) had long fallen out of use in Greek except in standing for number 6 by the time PGM V was written down. 8 Ischure ('Iscure) is a Greek word and not a barbarous name; it simply the vocative form of Iscuroj, “Mighty” and is not repeated in the original. 9 Some printed editions omit this “IAF” while retaining the gloss. 10 This is intelligible Greek and Crowley’s gloss is a straightforward translation; however the original has Qeou (genetive singular), erroneously rendered as THEON in the Goëtia version, read as Qewn (genetive plural). 11 Liddel-Scott Intermediate Greek-English (sic) Lexicon glosses qoroj as “semen genitale.” However the original Greek has DIACANNA CORUN here. 12 The reference is presumably to the design for a magic circle given in Book 4, Part 2 (it appears on the dust jacket of the Symonds & Grant edition of Magick; see also the figure “The Triangle of the Universe” illustrating Liber CMLXIII in Equinox I (3)). Within the circle are three lozenges marking the corners of an equilateral triangle; enclosed within this notional triangle is an inverted Tau of ten squares referred to the Sephiroth, so that the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH & LIBER VIII 52 Tiphareth square is at the centre of the circle. The design is somewhat impractical unless one has the regular use of a room some thirty feet or more in both horizontal dimensions, since you are supposed to have a double cube altar – traditionally 44 inches high with a 22 inch square base – standing exactly on the Malkuth square. 13 A note to the corresponding line in one of Crowley’s copies of the Goëtia (transcribed by Yorke) runs: “Osorronophris = The perfected Osiris. The hierophant in the G.D. neophyte ritual. But for those who accept Qelhma variation, the formula is of Horus. Ever-growing child, not dying God. Candidate ∴ is Horus, & the perfected Horus is Ra Hoor Khuit.” 14 See Parsifal for this symbolism. 15 The Greek spelling in the original enumerates to 915, 3 × 5 × 61. 16 There is no obvious reference to any “Magical Race” in any of the Oaths of A∴A∴ grades up to and including Adeptus Minor as given in “Liber Collegii Sancti,” unless one considers the A∴A∴ itself to fit this billing (an early typescript of the A∴A∴ Neophyte ritual, “Liber DCLXXI vel uart,” is extant which refers to the order as the “M—— [Mysteries, presumably] of I—— [Initiation (boring but possible)? Isis? Iacchus? Israel? Israfel?],” possibly whatever the I stands for should be substituted). Israel Regardie, when he produced an adaptation of the “Bornless One” as an example ritual for the collection of Golden Dawn papers he edited, substituted “The Magic of Light”, a reference to the sub-title of the G.D. Z2 paper, with “prophets of the Sun” in line 3. DuQuette (in his Magick of Thelema) and others suggest THELEMA. 17 No clear explanation is given for this instruction. On the face of it, this is a ritual of invocation, and in chapter X, s. II, of MTP, Crowley says of circumambulations and spiral movements in the circle: “if performed deosil they invoke—if widdershins, they banish.” One possible explanation lies in the footnote to that passage: “Such, at least is the traditional interpretation. But there is a deeper design which may be expressed through the direction of rotation. Certain forces of the most formidable character may be invoked by circum-ambulation Widdershins when it is executed with intent towards them, and the initiated technique. Of such forces Typhon is the type and the war of the Titans against the Olympians the legend. (Teitan, Titan, has in Greek the numerical value of 666).” As noted, while in section A. the entity invoked is hailed as “Asar-un-Nefer”, the opening of section C. is strikingly close to the beginning of an invocation of Set-Typhon in the Leiden Papyrus (the Greek text of which was also, as it happens, printed by Crowley in his edition of the Goëtia, as a curse against Mathers). If on the other hand we do not want to admit that Kenneth Grant (see for example the notes to the edition of Magick he co-edited with John Symonds) was right about this ritual after all, we might consider the possibility that Samekh is, in fact, just as much an exorcism or banishing as the original “Stele of Jeu”: that is, it is intended to “deliver him, NN” – the operator himself – “from the daimon which restrains him” – his own mundane personality. 18 Possibly there is a qabalistic significance to this; one thus travels 2¼ circles total, or 810 degrees. The best I can manage off the top of my head is 810 = IW, Greek “Hail!” 19 The identification of the Direction of Boleskine with the Kiblah (an Arabic term denoting the direction one faces to pray) is presumably based on AL III, 10 (plus the other two verses cited, which are far more ambiguous). <COP> This involves the assumption that “it” in “it shall be your Kiblah forever” refers to “thy secret temple—and that temple is already aright disposed” and not “the stélé of revealing itself” </COP>. Assuming the thing has not been stolen (or sold by unscrupulous museum staff) and replaced with a replica in the meantime, the original Stélé is still closed “in locked glass” in a museum in Cairo. Incidentally the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ENDNOTES 53 name of the Victorious City can be fudged to 418 just as easily as that of Crowley’s country house. 20 Plate X in Equinox I (7) was an illustration to “A Brief Abstract of the Symbolic Representation of the Universe” (“Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh”) showing various sigils received during the Dee-Kelly workings; the four characters outside the square are said to be the sigils of the four “Angel Overseers”, referred to in Liber 84 (possibly following a Golden Dawn tradition) as “Supreme Elemental Kings.” In a copy of the Goëtia with annotations to the Preliminary Invocation, apparently transcribed by Gerald Yorke from at least two different copies annotated by Crowley, the names and sigils appear at the head of each elemental section. The names are as follows: Air (AR THIAO &c.) Tahoeloj; Fire (AROGOGOROBRAO &c.) Ohooohaatan; Water (ROUBRIAO MARIODAM &c.): Thahebyo-beeatan; Earth (MA BARRAIO &c.): Thahaaotahe. The characters (in order Air, Fire, Water, Earth) are: Ä Ç Å Æ 21 See “Liber O vel Manus et Saggittæ” (Liber VI) In the Yorke copy of the Goetia, in addition to the names and sigils mentioned in the previous note, at the head of each elemental section is a stick figure in the appropriate elemental grade sign, along with the appropriate invoking elemental pentagram and Hebrew name (again, see “Liber VI,” cap. IV, for these). At the head of the AOTH ABAOTH &c. section are shown the LVX signs, the Mark of the Beast (see note below) and the invoking Active Spirit pentagram with hyha; no signs, pentagrams or names are given for the IEOU PUR IOU &c. section. 22 i.e., the phallus. 23 In Yorke’s transcript of Crowley’s notes on the “Preliminary Invocation” this is given as the “Sun and Moon conjoined with two witnesses”, i.e.: Y 24 Even if we follow Aune’s translation of this line: “He is the one who made all things by the command of his voice; Lord, King, Master, Helper” most of this analysis stands. 25 One suspects the original idea was “having sight in the feet” owing to lack of head. “Bornless” is a ghastly G.D.-ism, the Greek has akefaloj, “headless.” 26 “Evil” is not that great a translation of the original Greek which has ¢dikhmata, approx. “unjust deeds”; “I am He, the Truth! who hate that iniquity be wrought in the kosmos” might perhaps be a better reading, the objection being to departure from the equilibrium represented hy the central position of Tiphareth. 27 Kenneth Grant, in a note to the RKP edition of Magick explains this thusly: “The ‘ten that is one’ is the I and the O conjoined: 1 + 0 = 1. The ‘one that is one in three’ is A (Aleph) = 1. IAO, Aleph is the one in three. Aleph conceals the I and the O ‘in six,’ i.e. Vau, the Son.” The modified formula VIAOV (= 93 counting the O as u) is expounded in some detail, as noted, in Magick. The footnote was misprinted in the first edition, reading “... will not be “The Fifteen by fucntion” instead of “Five,” etc. ...”; Symonds and Grant in the RKP edition realised this reading was erroneous, but assumed the error was “not” for “now.” The number of Vau is 6, which is also the number of the Sun; further, in the formula of Tetragrammaton Vau refers to the Son, who is referred to the Sephiroth from Chesed to Yesod but particularly to Tiphareth, again referred to 6 and the Sun; hence “The Sun—6—the Sun.” 28 One suggested solution to this (I claim no credit for it, I read it on an Internet discussion group): Yod, 10, reduces to 1 by summing digits or Aiq Bkr (“ten that is one”); Aleph"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"LIBER SAMEKH & LIBER VIII 54 expands to 111 by spelling it “in full” ALP (“one that is one in three”); Vau is six; multiplying these three together gives the magic number. 29 This using the Hebrew numerations and taking the S as Samekh. Taking the S as Shin we get 310 whose meanings include “To trample on, conquer”; “To govern, bind” and “A young Lion.” (Liber D, s.v.). Alternatively, Sabao may be a bad transliteration of the Hebrew for “seven.” Using the Greek values, and keeping F (digamma = 6) for the last letter, SABAF = 210, 2 × 3 × 5 × 7, the product of the first four primes, and also the number of N.O.X. See “An Essay on Number” in Liber LVIII, s.v. 210. IAF SABAF = 227 (prime) whose meanings includes rkz, referred in Liber D to the “Sacred Phallus.” Reading it as IAW SABAW we get 811 + 1004 = 1815 (3 × 5 × 11 × 11) a number for which I yet to fully work out the Qabalistic significance, although the factorisation is suggestive. In any case, the final declaration is not in PGM V and was presumably added by whoever worked up the ritual from Godwin’s publication. 30 v.l. (in the first printed edition and one of the extant TSS) “his”; while a reasonable reading if the sentence is taken in itself, “this” seems more plausible given the previous paragraphs. 31 Chaldæan Oracles, the first passage is somewhat rearranged from framgents 196 and 199 in the Westcott edn.; the second is fragment 198 in the same edition and is here quoted verbatim. For the former, Westcott gives: 196: If thou often invokest thou shalt see all things growing dark; and then when no longer is visible unto thee the High-arched Vault of Heaven, when the Stars have lost their Light and the Lamp of the Moon is veiled, the Earth abideth not, and around thee darts the Lightning Flame and all things appear amid thunders. 199: When thou shalt behold that holy and formless fire shining flashingly through the depths of the Universe: Hear thou the Voice of Fire. (“all the phantasms are vanished” is possibly a gloss by someone in the G.D. (the phrase appears in the Golden Dawn Practicus Ritual in the course of a long speech by the Hierophant consisting of extracts and paraphrases from the Oracles), on “no longer is visible unto thee ... the Earth abideth not”; it is not in the Westcott edition.) 32 Crowley, Tannhäuser, Act IV, Scene II. Emphasis added in MTP. 33 “... we’ll tear your soul apart” – the Lead Cenobite in Hellraiser. 34 ... until the Angel finally gets sick of playing nice and knees him in the groin – vide Genesis XXXII, 25. 35 Yes, Aleister. 36 The allusion is probably to II Corinthians XII, 12. Liber VIII 37 A Crowley ritual of this title (also known as Ritual CXX) has been published as facsimile MS, and transcripts thereof posted on the Internet, although the ritual in question does not contain a clear description of the temple, aside from the fact that it contains a ten and a half foot long green porcelain boat, presumably on wheels, which has to circle the temple. In any case I have been reliably informed (private communication) that a revised and more practical version of this ritual survives in an unpublished Crowley MS notebook. 38 Storax. 39 This is the Oil of Abramelin; see The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, Book II, cap. 11; the incense recipe is from the same source."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ENDNOTES 55 40 All the available evidence tends to indicate that the Robe of a Probationer of A∴A∴ was white with no hood, a pentagram on the front and a hexagram on the back as described.
