At the Hour of Fears When the lordly Lion rears In mid-heaven his bulk of bane Violently vivid, shakes his mane Majestical, and Snake and Bull Lamp the horizon, and the full Fire of the moon tops heaven, and spurs The stars, while Mars ruddily burns, And Venus glows, and Jupiter Ramps through the sky astride of her, Then, unattended, let the king Press on the little secret spring That guards the garden, and entering Lay once his hand upon him, even While in the white arms of his heaven He swoons to sleep. That dreadful summons From the wild witchery his woman’s. That shaft of shattering truth shall splinter The pine of his soul’s winter. Then do thou following cry once His name; as from eclipse the sun’s Supernal splendour springs, his sight Shall leap to light. PSYCHE Shall leap to light! Master, this wisdom how repay? HERMES I am sworn unto thy father -- Nay! Weep not and kneel not! See, mine art [The two other handmaidens are seen standing by their fellow.] Hath wrought such wonder in thine heart That -- look! PSYCHE Ah! Pistis, Elpis! how Are you here? You were not with me now! You fled me. Charis only came Through those dark dreams. HERMES Farewell! Proclaim For my reward my art’s success. More than yourself need happiness. PSYCHE Farewell and prosper greatly! [She goes out with her maidens. HERMES And thou, live high and stately In gory and gree tenfold That which thou hadst of old! [He draws the curtain. SCENE IV: THE ANTECHAMBER OF THE KING’S PALACE. It is a vast hall of black marble. At the corners four fountains play in basins of coloured marble. At the back a narrow door pillared by vast man-bulls in white marble. In mid-stage the LADY PSYCHE, seated on the ground, her long hair unloosed, her robe of shining silver, mourns. With her are the three handmaidens bowed and mourning at front of the stage R., C., and L. the aged women are grouped in front of stage C., on the steps which lead to the hall. No light comes save through the roves of the LADY PSYCHE from the jewels that adorn her. Their glimmer is, however, such as to fill the hall with moony radiance, misty dim, and lost in the vastness of the building. PSYCHE. Silence grows hateful; hollow is mine heart Here in the fateful hall; I wait apart. Dimmer, still dimmer darkness veils my sight; There is no glimmer heralding the light. I, the King’s daughter, am but serf and thrall Where Time hath wrought her cobweb in the hall. this blood avails not; where’s the signet ring Whose pussiance fails not to arouse the King? Heir of his heart, I am uncrowned; then, one that hath no art or craft in Babylon. I left my home and found a vassal’s house -- This lampless dome of death, vertiginous! O for the foam of billows that carouse About the crag-set columns! for the breeze That fans their flagging Caryatides! For the gemmed vestibule, the porch of pearl, The bowers of rest, the silences that furl Their wings upon mine amethystine chamber Whose lions shone with emerald and amber! O for the throne whereon my father’s awe, Lofty and lone, lets liberty love law! All justice wrought, its sword the healer’s knife! All mercy, not less logical than life! Alas! I wait a widowed suppliant Betrayed to fate, blind trampling elephant. I wait and mourn. Will not the dust disclose The Unicorn, the Unicorn that goes About the gardens of these halls of Spring, First of the wardens that defend the King? Wilt thou not bring me to the Unicorn? [The Unicorn passes over. He has the swiftness of the horse, the slimness of the deer, the whiteness of the swan, the horn of the narwhal. He couches upon the right side of the LADY PSYCHE.] Hail! thou that holdest thine appointed station, Lordliest and boldest of his habitation, Silence that foldest over its creation! [The Lion passes over. He is redder than the setting sun. He couches upon the left side of the LADY PSYCHE.] Hail! thou that art his ward and warrior, The brazen heart, the iron pulse of war! Up start, up start! and set thyself to roar! [The Peacock passes over. This peacock is so great"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"that his fan, as he spreads it on couching before the face of the LADY PSYCHE, fills the whole of the hall.] Hail! glory and light his majesty that hideth, Pride and delight whereon his image rideth, While in thick night and darkness he abideth! [The stage now darkens. Even the light shed by the jewels of the LADY PSYCHE is extinguished. then, from the gate of the Palace between the man-bulls there issueth a golden hawk. In his beak is a jewel which he drops into the lamp that hangs from the height above the head of the LADY PSYCHE. this lamp remains dark. During his darkness the Unicorn, the Lion, and the Peacock disappear.] Love me and lead me through the blind abysses! Fill me and feed me on the crowning kisses, Like flowers that flicker in the garden of glory, Pools of pure liquor like pale flames and hoary That lamp the lightless empyrean! Ah! love me! All space be sightless, and thine eyes above me! Thrice burnt and branded on this bleeding brow, Stamp thou the candid stigma -- even now! [The lamp flashes forth into dazzling but momentary radiance. As it goes out a cone of white light is seen upon the head of THE LADY PSYCHE, And before her stands a figure of immense height cloaked and hooded in perfect blackness.] THE KING. Come! for the throne is hollow. The eagle hath cried: Come away! The stars are numbered, and the tide Turns. Follow! Follow! Thine Adonis slumbered. As a bride Adorned, come, follow! Fate alone is fallen and wried. Follow me, follow! The unknown is satisfied. [The LADY PSYCHE is lifted to her feet. In silence she bows, and in silence follows him as he turns and advances to the gate while the curtain falls.] SCENE V: THE GARDEN OF THE LADY ASTARTE. THE LORD ESARHADDON is lying on the couch with his mistress. Their arms are intertwined. They and their slaves and maidens are all fallen into the abysses of deep sleep. It is a cloudless night; and the full moon, approaching mid-heaven, casts but the shortest shadows. The Murmur of the Breeze I am the Breeze to bless the bowers, Sigh through the trees, caress the flowers; Each folded bud to sway, to swoon, With its green blood beneath the moon Stirred softly by my kiss; I bear The sort reply of amber air To the exhaled sighs of the heat That dreams and dies amid the wheat, From the cool breasts of mountains far -- Their serried crests clasp each a star! The earth’s pulse throbs with mighty rivers; With her low sobs God’s heaven quivers; The dew stands on her brow; with love She aches for all the abyss above, Her rocks and chasms the lively strife Of her sharp spasms of lust, of life. Hark! to the whisper of my fan, My sister kiss to maid and man. Through all earth’s wombs, through all sea’s waves, Gigantic glooms, forgotten graves, I haunt the tombs of kings and slaves. I hush the babe, I wake the bird, I wander away beyond stars unstirred, Soften the ripples of the tide, Soothe the bruised nipples of the bride, Help stars and clouds play hide-and-seek, Wind seamen’s shrouds, bid ruins speak, Bring dreams to slumber, sleep to dream Whose demons cumber night’s extreme. And softer sped than dream or death Quiet as the dead, or slain love’s breath, I sigh for loves that swoon upon The hanging groves of Babylon. Each terrace adds a shower of scent Where lass and lad seduce content; Each vine that hangs confirms the stress Of purer pangs of drunkenness; Each marble wall and pillar swerves Majestical my course to curves Subtle as breasts and limbs and tresses Of this caressed suave sorceress’s That raves and rests in wildernesses Whose giant gifts are strength that scars Her soul and lifts her to the stars, Savage, and tenderness that tunes Her spirit’s splendour to the moon’s, And music of passion to outrun The fiery fashion of the sun. Hush! there’s a stir not mine amid the groves, A foot divine that yet is not like live’s. Hush! let me furl my forehead! I’ll be gone To flicker and curl above great Babylon. [The Gate of the Garden op ens. THE LADY PSYCHE advances and makes way for THE KING OF BABYLON. He is attended by many companies of warriors in armour of burnished silver and gold, with swords, spears, and shields. These take up position at the back of the stage, in perfect silence of foot as of throat.] [THE LADY PSYCHE remains standing by the gate;"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE KING OF BABYLON advances with infinite stealth, dignity, slowness, and power, toward the couch.] PSYCHE. Life? Is it life? What hour of fate is on the bell? Of this supreme ordeal what issue? Heaven or hell? I am stripped of all my power now when I need it most; I am empty and unreal, a shadow or a ghost. All the great stake is thrown, even now the dice are falling. All deeds are locked in links, one to another calling through time: from the dim throne the first rune that was ree’d By God, the supreme Sphinx, determined the last deed. [THE KING OF BABYLON reaches forth his hand and arm. It is the hand and arm of a skeleton. He touches the forehead of the sleeping lord. Instantly, radiant and naked, a male figure is seen erect.] PSYCHE Adonis! ADONIS Psyche! [They run together and embrace. PSYCHE Ah! long-lost! ADONIS My wife! Light, O intolerable! Infinite love! O life Beyond death! PSYCHE I have found thee! ADONIS I was thine. PSYCHE I thine From all the ages! ADONIS To the ages! PSYCHE Mine! [The KING passes over and departs. Chorus of Soldiers Hail to the Lord! Without a spear, without a sword He hath smitten, he hath smitten, one stroke of his worth all our weaponed puissiances. There is no helm, no hauberk, no cuirass, No shield of sevenfold steel and sevenfold brass Resists his touch; no sword, no spear but shivers Before his glance. Eternally life quivers And reels before him; death itself, the hound of god, Slinks at his heel, and licks the dust that he hath trod. [They follow their Lord, singing. PSYCHE. I am a dewdrop focussing the sun That fires the forest to the horizon. I am a cloud on whom the sun begets The iris arch, a fountain in whose jets Throbs inner fire of the earth’s heart, a flower Slain by the sweetness of the summer shower. ADONIS I am myself, knowing I am thou. Forgetfulness forgotten now! Truth, truth primeval, truth eternal, Unconditioned, sempiternal, Sets the God within the shrine And my mouth on thine, on thine. [THE LADY ASTARTE wakes. In her arms is the corpse of the LORD ESARHADDON.] ASTARTE O fearful dreams! Awake and kiss me! Awake! I thought I was crushed and strangled by a snake. [She rises. The corpse falls. He is dead! He is dead! O lips of burning bloom, You are ashen. [The jaw falls. The black laughter of the tomb! Then let me kill myself! Bring death distilled From nightshade, monkshood. Let no dawn regild this night. Let me not see the damnèd light Of day, but drown in this black-hearted night! Ho, slaves! [ADONIS and PSYCHE advance to her. ADONIS Thyself a slave! What curse (unbated Till patient earth herself is nauseated) Is worse than this, an handmaiden that creeps Into her mistress’ bed while her lord sleeps, And robs her? ASTARTE And what worse calamity Than his revenge? But leave me, let me die! [She falls prone at their feet. PSYCHE Add robbery to robbery! We need thee To serve us. Let us raise thee up and feed thee, Comfort and cherish thee until the end, Less slave than child, less servitor than friend. ADONIS Rise! let the breath flow, let the lips affirm Fealty and love. To the appointed term Within thy garden as belovèd guests Of thine, let us abide. Now lips and breasts"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Touching, three bodies and one soul, the triple troth confirm. PSYCHE The great indissoluble oath! ASTARTE Lift me! [They raise her; all embrace. By him that ever reigns upon The throne, and wears the crown, of Babylon, I serve, and love.

ADONIS Live’s great globe of gold! ASTARTE Come! let us break our fast. PSYCHE My long fast’s broken. ADONIS Let us talk of love. PSYCHE Love’s first-last word is spoken. ADONIS Nay! but the tides of trouble are transcended. The word’s begun, but never shall be ended. And through the sun forsake the maiden east, Life be for us a never-fading feast. [They go towards the house, singing. ALL. The Crown of our life is our love, The crown of our love is the light That rules all the region above The night and the stars of the night; That rules all the region aright, The abyss to abysses above; For the crown of our love is the light, And the crown of our light is our love.
