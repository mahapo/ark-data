It has not been possible to construct this book on a basis of pureScepticism. This matters less, as the practice leads to Scepticism, andit may be through it.]0. This book is not intended to lead to the supreme attainment. Onthe contrary, its results define the separate being of the ExemptAdept from the rest of the Universe, and discover his relation to thatUniverse.1. It is of such importance to the Exempt Adept that we cannotoverrate it. Let him in no wise adventure the plunge into the Abyssuntil he have accomplished this to his most perfectest satisfaction.2. For in the Abyss no effort is anywise possible. The Abyss is passedby virtue of the mass of the Adept and his Karma. Two forces impelhim: 1. the attraction of Binah, 2. the impulse of his Karma; and theease and even the safety of his passage depend on the strength anddirection of the latter."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"3. Should one rashly dare the passage, and take the irrevocable Oathof the Abyss, he might be lost therein through Aeons of incalculableagony; he might even be thrown back upon Chesed, with the terribleKarma of failure added to his original imperfection.4. It is even said that in certain circumstances it is possible to fallaltogether from the Tree of Life, and to attain the Towers of the BlackBrothers. But We hold that this is not possible for any adept who hastruly attained his grade, or even for any man who has really soughtto help humanity even for a single second (1), and that although hisaspiration have been impure through vanity or any similarimperfection.5. Let then the Adept who finds the result of these meditationsunsatisfactory refuse the Oath of the Abyss, and live so that hisKarma gains strength and direction suitable to the task at somefuture period.6. Memory is essential to the individual consciousness; otherwise themind were but a blank sheet on which shadows are cast. But we seethat not only does the mind retain impressions, but that it is soconstituted that its tendency is to retain some more excellently thanothers. Thus the great classical scholar, Sir Richard Jebb, was unableto learn even the schoolboy mathematics required for the preliminaryexamination at Cambridge University, and a special act of theauthorities was required in order to admit him.7. The first method to be described has been detailed in BhikkhuAnanda Metteya’s ʺTraining of the Mindʺ (EQUINOX, I. 5, pp. 28-59,and especially pp. 48-56). We have little to alter or to add. Its mostimportant result, as regards the Oath of the Abyss, is the freedomfrom all desire or clinging to anything which it gives. Its second"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"result is to aid the adept in the second method, by supplying himwith further data for his investigation.8. The stimulation of memory useful in both practices is also achievedby simple meditation (Liber E), in a certain stage of which oldmemories arise unbidden. The adept may then practise this, stoppingat that stage, and encouraging instead of suppressing the flashes ofmemory.9. Zoroaster has said, ʺExplore the River of the Soul, whence or inwhat order you have come; so that although you have become aservant to the body, you may again rise to that Order (the A.·.A.·.)from which you descended, joining Works (Kamma) to the SacredReason (the Tao).ʺ10. The Result of the Second Method is to show the Adept to whatend his powers are destined. When he has passed the Abyss andbecome NEMO, the return of the current causes him ʺto appear in theHeaven of Jupiter as a morning star or as an evening star.ʺ (2) Inother words, he should discover what may be the nature of his work.Thus Mohammed was a Brother reflected into Netzach, Buddha aBrother reflected into Hod, or, as some say, Daath. The presentmanifestation of Frater P. to the outer is in Tiphereth, to the inner inthe path of Leo.11. First Method. Let the Exempt Adept first train himself to thinkbackwards by external means, as set forth here following:(ʺaʺ) Let him learn to write backwards, with either hand.(ʺbʺ) Let him learn to walk backwards.(ʺcʺ) Let him constantly watch, if convenient, cinematograph films,and listen to phonograph records, reversed, and let him so accustomhimself to these that they appear natural, and appreciable as a whole."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"(ʺdʺ) Let him practise speaking backwards; thus for ʺI am Heʺ let himsay, ʺEh ma I.ʺ(ʺeʺ) Let him learn to read backwards. In this it is difficult to avoidcheating oneʹs self, as an expert reader sees a sentence at a glance. Lethis disciple read aloud to him backwards, slowly at first, then morequickly.(ʺfʺ) Of his own ingenium, let him devise other methods.12. In this his brain will at first be overwhelmed by a sense of utterconfusion; secondly, it will endeavour to evade the difficulty by atrick. The brain will pretend to be working backwards when it isreally normal. It is difficult to describe the nature of the trick, but itwill be quite obvious to anyone who has done practices (ʺaʺ) and (ʺbʺ)for a day or two. They become quite easy, and he will think that he ismaking progress, an illusion which close analysis will dispel.13. Having begun to train his brain in this manner, and obtainedsome little success, let the Exempt Adept, seated in his Asana, thinkfirst of his present attitude, next of the act of being seated, next of hisentering the room, next of his robing, et cetera, exactly as ithappened. And let him most strenuously endeavour to think each actas happening backwards. It is not enough to think: ʺI am seated here,and before that I was standing, and before that I entered the room,ʺetc. That series is the trick detected in the preliminary practices. Theseries must not run ʺghi-defabcʺ but ʺihgfedcbaʺ: not ʺhorse a is thisʺbut ʺesroh a si sihtʺ. To obtain this thoroughly well, practice (ʺcʺ) isvery useful. The brain will be found to struggle constantly to rightitself, soon accustoming itself to accept ʺesrohʺ as merely anotherglyph for ʺhorse.ʺ This tendency must be constantly combated.14. In the early stages of this practice the endeavour should be tometiculous minuteness of detail in remembering actions; for thebrain’s habit of thinking forwards will at first be insuperable.Thinking of large and complex actions, then, will give a series whichwe may symbolically write ʺopqrstu-hijklmn-abcdefg.ʺ If these be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"split into detail, we shall have ʺstu-pqr-o---mn-kl-hij---fg-cde-ab,ʺwhich is much nearer to the ideal ʺutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba.ʺ15. Capacities differ widely, but the Exempt Adept need have noreason to be discouraged if after a month’s continuous labour he findthat now and again for a few seconds his brain really worksbackwards.16. The Exempt Adept should concentrate his efforts upon obtaininga perfect picture of five minutes backwards rather than uponextending the time covered by his meditation. For this preliminarytraining of the brain is the Pons Asinorum of the whole process.17. This five minutes’ exercise being satisfactory, the Exempt Adeptmay extend the same at his discretion to cover an hour, a day, aweek, and so on. Difficulties vanish before him as he advances; theextension from a day to the course of his whole life will not prove sodifficult as the perfecting of the five minutes.18. This practice should be repeated at least four times daily, andprogress is shown firstly by the ever easier running of the brain,secondly by the added memories which arise.19. It is useful to reflect during this practice, which in time becomesalmost mechanical, upon the way in which effects spring fromcauses. This aids the mind to link its memories, and prepares theadept for the preliminary practice of the Second Method.20. Having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to thehour of birth, it should be encouraged to endeavour to penetratebeyond that period. If it be properly trained to run backwards, therewill be little difficulty in doing this, although it is one of the distinctsteps in the practice."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"21. It may be then that the memory will persuade the adept of someprevious existence. Where this is possible, let it be checked by anappeal to facts, as follows:22. It often occurs to men that on visiting a place to which they havenever been, it appears familiar. This may arise from a confusion ofthought or a slipping of the memory, but it is conceivably a fact. If,then, the adept ʺrememberʺ that he was in a previous life in somecity, say Cracow, which he has in this life never visited, let himdescribe from memory the appearance of Cracow, and of itsinhabitants, setting down their names. Let him further enter intodetails of the city and its customs. And having done this with greatminuteness, let him confirm the same by consultation with historiansand geographers, or by a personal visit, remembering (both to thecredit of his memory and its discredit) that historians, geographers,and himself are alike fallible. But let him not trust his memory toassert its conclusions as fact, and act thereupon, without mostadequate confirmation.23. This process of checking his memory should be practised with theearlier memories of childhood and youth by reference to thememories and records of others, always reflecting upon the fallibilityeven of such safeguards.24. All this being perfected, so that the memory reaches back intoaeons incalculably distant, let the Exempt Adept meditate upon thefruitlessness of all those years, and upon the fruit thereof, severingthat which is transitory and worthless from that which is eternal.And it may be that he being but an Exempt Adept may hold all to besavourless and full of sorrow.25. This being so, without reluctance will he swear the Oath of theAbyss."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"26. Second Method. Let the Exempt Adept, fortified by the practice ofthe First Method, enter the preliminary practice of the SecondMethod.27. Second Method. Preliminary Practices. Let him, seated in hisAsana, consider any event, and trace it to its immediate causes. Andlet this be done very fully and minutely. Here, for example, is a bodyerect and motionless. Let the adept consider the many forces whichmaintain it; firstly, the attraction of the earth, of the sun, of theplanets, of the farthest stars, nay, of every mote of dust in the room,one of which (could it be annihilated) would cause that body tomove, although so imperceptibly. Also the resistance of the floor, thepressure of the air, and all other external conditions. Secondly, theinternal forces which sustain it, the vast and complex machinery ofthe skeleton, the muscles, the blood, the lymph, the marrow, all thatmakes up a man. Thirdly the moral and intellectual forces involved,the mind, the will, the consciousness. Let him continue this withunremitting ardour, searching Nature, leaving nothing out.28. Next, let him take one of the immediate causes of his position, andtrace out its equilibrium. For example, the will. What determines thewill to aid in holding the body erect and motionless?29. This being discovered, let him choose one of the forces whichdetermined his will, and trace out that in similar fashion; and let thisprocess be continued for many days until the interdependence of allthings is a truth assimilated in his inmost being.30. This being accomplished, let him trace his own history withspecial reference to the causes of each event. And in this practice hemay neglect to some extent the universal forces which at all times acton all, as for example the attraction of masses, and let himconcentrate his attention upon the principal and determining oreffective causes. For instance, he is seated, perhaps, in a country place"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"in Spain. Why? Because Spain is warm and suitable for meditation,and because cities are noisy and crowded. Why is Spain warm? andwhy does he wish to meditate? Why choose warm Spain rather thanwarm India? To the last question: Because Spain is nearer to hishome. Then why is his home near Spain? Because his parents wereGermans. And why did they go to Germany? And so during thewhole meditation.31. On another day, let him begin with a question of another kind,and every day devise new questions, not only concerning his presentsituation, but also abstract questions. Thus let him connect theprevalence of water upon the surface of the globe with its necessity tosuch life as we know, with the specific gravity and other physicalproperties of water, and let him perceive ultimately through all thisthe necessity and concord of things, not concord as the schoolmen ofold believed, making all things for man’s benefit or convenience, butthe essential mechanical concord whose final law is ʺinertia.ʺ And inthese meditations let him avoid as if it were the plague anyspeculation sentimental or fantastic.32. Second Method. The Practice Proper. Having then perfected in hismind these conceptions, let him apply them to his own career,forging the links of memory into the chain of necessity. And let thisbe his final question: To what purpose am I fitted? Of what servicecan my being prove to the Brothers of the A.·.A.·. if I cross the Abyss,and am admitted to the City of the Pyramids?33. Now that he may clearly understand the nature of this question,and the method of solution, let him study the reasoning of theanatomist who reconstructs an animal from a single bone. To take asimple example:34. Suppose, having lived all my life among savages, a ship is castupon the shore and wrecked. Undamaged among the cargo is a"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ʺVictoria.ʺ What is its use? The wheels speak of roads, their slimnessof smooth roads, the brake of hilly roads. The shafts show that it wasmeant to be drawn by an animal, their height and length suggest ananimal of the size of a horse. That the carriage is open suggests aclimate tolerable at any rate for part of the year. The height of the boxsuggest crowded streets, or the spirited character of the animalemployed to draw it. The cushions indicate its use to convey menrather than merchandise; its hood that rain sometimes falls, or thatthe sun is at times powerful. The springs would imply considerableskill in metals; the varnish much attainment in that craft.35. Similarly, let the adept consider of his own case. Now that he ison the point of plunging into the Abyss a giant Why? confronts himwith uplifted club.36. There is no minutest atom of his composition which can bewithdrawn without making him some other than he is; no uselessmoment in his past. Then what is his future? The ʺVictoriaʺ is not awagon; it is not intended for carting hay. It is not a sulky; it is uselessin trotting races.37. So the adept has military genius, or much knowledge of Greek;how do these attainments help his purpose, or the purpose of theBrothers? He was put to death by Calvin, or stoned by Hezekiah; as asnake he was killed by a villager, or as an elephant slain in battleunder Hamilcar. How do such memories help him? Until he havethoroughly mastered the reason for every incident in his past, andfound a purpose for every item of his present equipment (3), hecannot truly answer even those Three Question what were first put tohim, even the Three Questions of the Ritual of the Pyramid; he is notready to swear the Oath of the Abyss.38. But being thus enlightened, let him swear the Oath of the Abyss;yea, let him swear the Oath of the Abyss."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(1) Those in possession of Liber CLXXXV will note that in every grade but onethe aspirant is pledged to serve his inferiors in the Order.(2) The formula of the Great Work ʺSolve et Coagulaʺ may be thus interpreted.Solve, the dissolution of the Self in the Infinite; Coagula, the presentation of theInfinite in a concrete form to the outer. Both are necessary to the Task of aMaster of the Temple.(3) A Brother known to me was repeatedly baffled in this meditation. But oneday being thrown with his horse over a sheer cliff of forty feet, and escapingwithout a scratch or a bruise, he was reminded of his many narrow escapes fromdeath.
