Within His skull exist daily thirteen thousand myriads of Worlds, whichdraw their existence from Him, and by Him are upheld. â€” I.R.Q. iii. 43.0. Let the Practicus study the textbooks of astronomy, travel, if need be, to aland where the sun and stars are visible, and observe the heavens with thebest telescopes to which he may have access. Let him commit to memorythe principal facts, and (at least roughly) the figures of the science.1. Now, since these figures will leave no direct impression with anyprecision upon his mind, let him adopt this practice A.A. Let the practicus be seated before a bare square table, and let anunknown number of small similar objects be thrown by his chela fromtime to time upon the table, and by that chela be hastily gathered up.Let the Practicus declare at the glance, and the chela confirm by hiscount, the number of such objects.The practice should be for a quarter of an hour thrice daily. Themaximum number of objects should at first be seven. This maximumshould increase by one at each practice, provided that not a singlemistake is made by the Practicus in appreciating the number thrown.This practice should continue assiduously for at least one year.The quickness of the chela in gathering up the objects is expected toincrease with time. The practice need not be limited to a quarter of anhour thrice daily after a time, but increased with discretion. Care mustbe taken to detect the first symptoms of fatigue, and to stop, if possible,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"even before it threatens. The practised psychologist learns to recogniseeven minute hesitations that mark the forcing of the attention.2. Alternating with the above, let the Practicus begin this practice B. It isassumed that he has thoroughly conquered the elementary difficulties ofDharana, and is able to prevent mental pictures from altering shape, sizeand colour against his will.B. Seated in the open air, let him endeavour to form a complete mentalpicture of himself and his immediate surroundings. It is important thathe should be in the centre of such picture, and able to look freely in alldirections. The finished picture should be a complete consciousness ofthe whole fixed, clear, and definite.Let him gradually add to this picture by including objects more andmore distant, until he have an image of the whole field of vision.He will probably discover that it is very difficult to increase the apparentsize of the picture as he proceeds, and it should be his most earnestendeavour to do so. He should seek in particular to appreciate distances,almost to the point of combatting the laws of perspective.3. These practices A and B accomplished, and his studies in astronomycompleted, let him attempt this practice C.C. Let the Practicus form a mental picture of the Earth, in particularstriving to realize the size of the Earth in comparison with himself, andlet him not be content until by assiduity he has well succeeded.Let him add the moon, keeping well in mind the relative sizes of, and thedistance between, the planet and its satellite.He will probably find the final trick of the mind to be a constantdisappearance of the image, and the appearance of the same upon asmaller scale. This trick he must outwit by constancy of endeavour.He will then in add in turn Venus, Mars, Mercury and the Sun.It is permissible at this stage to change the point of view to the centre ofthe Sun, and to do so may add stability to the conception.The Practicus may then a the Asteroids, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus andNeptune. The utmost attention to detail is now necessary, as the pictureis highly complex, apart from the difficulty of appreciating relative size"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and distance.Let this picture be practised month after month until it is absolutelyperfect. The tendency which may manifest itself to pass into Dhyana andSamadhi must be resolutely combated with the whole strength of themind.Let the Practicus then re-commence the picture, starting from the Sun,and adding the planets one by one, each with its proper motion, until hehave an image perfect in all respect of the Solar System as it actuallyexists. Let him particularly note that unless the apparent sizeapproximate to the real, his practice is wasted. Let him then add a cometto the picture; he may find, perhaps that the path of this comet mayassist him to expand the sphere of his mental vision until it include astar.And thus, gathering one star after another, let his contemplation becomevast as the heaven, in space and time ever aspiring to the perception ofthe Body of Nuit; yea, the Body of Nuit."}]
