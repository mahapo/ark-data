E.S.T.{alpha} APOLOGIAI have begotten thee, o my Son, and that strangely, as thou knowest, upon the Scarlet Woman called Hilarion,as it was mysteriously foretold unto me in The Book of the Law. Now therefore that thou art come to the Ageof Understanding, do thou give ear unto my Wisdom, for that therein lieth a simple and direct Way for everyMan that he may attain to the End.Firstly, then, I would have thee to know that Spiritual Experience and Perfection have no necessaryconnection with Advancement in our Holy Order. But for each Man is a Path: there is a Constant, and there isa Variable. Seek ever therefore in thy Work of the Promulgation of the Law to discover in each Man his owntrue Nature, that he may in due Season accomplish it not only for himself, but for all who are bound untohim. There are very many for whom in their present Incarnations this Great Work may be impossible; sincetheir appointed Work may be in Satisfaction of some Magical Debt, or in Adjustment of some Balance, or inFulfilment of some Defect. As is written: Suum Cuique.Now because thou art the Child of my Bowels, I yearn greatly towards thee, o my Son, and I strive stronglywith my Spirit that by my Wisdom I may make plain thy Way before thee; and thus in many Chapters will Iwrite for thee those things that may profit thee. Sis benedictus .{beta} DE ARTE KABBALISTICA.Do thou study most constantly, my Son, in the Art of the Holy Qabalah. Know that herein the Relationsbetween Numbers, though they be mighty in Power and prodigal of Knowledge, are but lesser Things. For theWork is to reduce all other conceptions to these of Number, because thus thou wilt lay bare the very Structureof thy Mind, whose rule is Necessity rather than Prejudice. Not until the Universe is thus laid naked beforethee canst thou truly anatomize it. The Tendencies of thy Mind lie deeper far than any Thought, for they arethe Conditions and the Laws of Thought; and it is these that thou must bring to Nought.This Way is most sure; most sacred; and the Enemies thereof most awful, most sublime. It is for the GreatSouls to enter on this Rigour and Austerity. To them the Gods themselves do Homage; for it is the Way ofUtmost Purity. Liber Aleph vel CXI{alpha} APOLOGIA5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"{gamma} DE VITA CORRIGENDA.Know, son, that the true Principle of Self−Control is Liberty. For we are born into a World which is inBondage to Ideals; to them we are perforce fitted, even as the Enemies to the Bed of Procrustes. Each of us,as he grows, learns Repression of himself and his true Will. \"It is a lie, this folly against self.\": these Wordsare written in The Book of the Law. So therefore these Passions in ourselves which we understand to beHindrances are not part of our True Will, but diseased Appetites, manifest in us through false early Training.Thus the Tabus of savage Tribes in such matter as Love constrain that True Love which is born in us; and bythis Constraint come ills of Body and Mind.

For Love wereto them the eternal Eden, save for the Repression signified by the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.Thus their Nature of Love was perfect; it was their Fall from that Innocence which drove them from theGarden.In the Love of Romeo and Juliet was no Flaw; but family Feud, which imported nothing to that Love, was itsBane; and the Rashness and Violence of their Revolt against that Repression, slew them.In the pure Outrush of Love in Desdemona for Othello was no Flaw; but his Love was marred by hisconsciousness of his Age and his Race, of the Prejudices of his Fellows and of his own Experience ofWoman−Frailty.{epsilon} GESTA DE AMORE.Now as Literature overfloweth with the Murders of Love, so also doeth History, and the Lesson is ever thesame.Thus the Loves of Abelard and of Heloise were destroyed by the System of Repression in which theychanced to move.Thus Beatrice was robbed of Dante by social Artificialities; and Paolo slain on account of Things external tohis Love of Francesca.Then, per contra, Martin Luther, being a Giant of Will, and also the Eighth Henry of England, as a mightyKing, bent them to overturn the whole World that they might have satisfaction of their Loves.

Thus the Consciousness of the Will isdirected to the sore Spot, as in Pain, and seeketh comfort in an Externalisation, or shew, of that Antagonism.And because the Will is sacred, such dreams excite an Ecstacy or Phrenzy of Horror, Fear or Disgust. Thusthe true Will of Oedipus was toward the bed of Jocasta, but the Tabu, strong both by Inheritance and byEnvironment, was so attached to that Will that his Dream concerning his Destiny was a Dream of Fear and ofAbhorrence, his Fulfilment thereof (even in Ignorance) a spell to stir up all the subconscious Forces of all thePeople about him, and his Realization of the Act a madness potent to drive him to self−inflicted Blindnessand fury−haunted Exile.{mu} DE SOMNIIS.{delta}SEQUENTIA.Know firmly, o my son, that the true Will cannot err; for this is thine appointed course in Heaven, in whoseorder is Perfection.A Dream of Horror is therefore the most serious of all Warnings; for it signifieth that thy Will, which is ThySelf in respect of its Motion, is in Affliction and Danger.

Nay, o my son, I like not this Word, govern, for a Law is but a Statement of thenature of the Thing to which it applieth.

For first of all thou art necessarily moved toward the One End from thine own Station,but secondly thou art moved toward the End proper to thine own Race, and Caste, and Family, as by Virtue ofthy Birth. And these are, I may say it, Conditions or limits, of thine own individual Will. Thou dost laugh?Err not, my Son! The Magus, even as the Poet is the Expression of the true Will of his Fellows, and hisSuccess is his Proof, as it is written in The Book of the Law. For his Work is to free Men from the Fetters of afalse or a superannuated Will, revealing unto them, in Measure attuned to their Needs, their true Natures.{Beta }{xi } DE POETIS.For this Reason is the Poet called an Incarnation of the Zeitgeist, that is, of the Spirit or Will of his Period.

Now then the Poet is Interpreter of the Hieroglyphs of the Hidden Will ofMan in many a matter, some light, some deep, as it may be given unto him to do. Moreover, it is notaltogether in the Word of any Poem, but in the quintessential Flavour of the Poet, that thou mayst seek thisProphecy. And this is an Art most necessary to every Statesman.

Thus, He, like Lao−Tze, based all upon a Movement, instead of afixed Point. And His Way of Truth was Analysis, made possible by great Intention of the Mind toward itself,and that well fortified by certain tempered Rigour of Life. And He most thoroughly explored and Mapped outthe Fastnesses of the Mind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hand of Man.

Of all the Occasions of this Grievance the most common is the Desire of Sexunsatisfied; and thou knowest already, even in thy young Experience, how in hat Delirium the Weal of theWhole Universe appeareth of no Account. Do thou wean thy Babes from that Simplicity, and instil the Senseof true Proportion. For verily this is a Way of Madness, Love, unless it be under Will.

But the Busy−body normindeth his own Business, nor leaveth others to mind theirs. Be thou instant therefore with such an one, tocure him by enlightening his Will, and speeding him therein. Remember also that if one speak ill of another,the Fault is first of all in himself, for we know naught but that which is within us. Did not the greatWitch−Finder end by confessing hat he also was a Sorcerer? We become that which obsesseth us, eitherthrough extreme Hate or Extreme Love.

Watch hen, and heed thyself; and pay no Heed to thy Fellows, insofar as theyimpede thee not. And let this be the Rule. For every Will is pure and every Orbit free; but Error bringethConfusion. See therefore that none leave his Path, lest he foul that of his Brother; and remember also thatwith Speed cometh Ease of Control.

For Men thought that the Sun died and was reborn alike in the Day and in theYear; and so also was the Mystery of Man. Now already are we well assured by Science how the Death of theSun is in Truth but the Shifting of a Shadow; and in this Aeon (o my son, I lift up my Voice and I makeProphecy!) so shall it be proven as to Death. For the Body of Man is but his Shadow, it cometh and goetheven as the tides of Ocean; and he only is in Darkness who is hidden by that Shadow from the Light of histrue Self.

QUORUM SUNT QUATTOURMINORES.I have already written unto thee, my Son, of the Paradox of Liberty, how the Freedom of thy Will dependethupon the Bending of all thy forces to that one End. But now also learn how great is the Oeconomy of ourMagick, and this will I declare unto thee in a Figure of the Holy Qabalah, to wit, the Formula of theTetragrammaton. Firstly, the Operation of Yod and He is not Vau only, but with Vau appeareth also a newHe, as a By−OProduct, and She is mysterious, being at once the Flower of the three others, and their Poison.Now by the Operation of Vau upon that He is no new Creation, but the Daughter is set upon the Throne ofHer Mother, and by this is rekindled the Fire of Yod, which, consuming that Virgin, doth not add a FifthPerson, but balanceth and perfecteth all. For his Shin, that is the Holy Spirit, pervadeth these, and isimmanent. Thus in three Operations is the Pentagram formulated. But in the Figure of that Star theseOperations are not indicated, for the five Lines of Force connect not according to any of them; but five newOperations are made possible; and these are the Works proper to the perfected man. First, the Work whichlieth level, the Vau with the He, is of he Yang and the Yin, and maketh One the Human with the Divine, as inthe Attainment of the Master of the Temple. Yet his Work hath his Perversion, which is of Death. Thus thenfor thee four Works, they pertain all to the Natural Formula of the Cross and Rose.

QUORUM SUNT QUATTUORMAJORES.O my Son, behold now the Virtue and Mystery of the Silver Star! For of these four Works not one leadeth tothe Crown, because Tetragrammaton hath his Root only in Chokmah. So herefore the Formula of the RosyCross availeth no more in he Highest. Now then in the Pentagram are two Lines that invoke Spirit, thoughthey lead not thereunto, and they are he Works of He with He, and of Yod with Vau. Of thee twain he formeris a Work Magical of the Nature of Music, and it draweth down the Fire of the HIGHER by Seduction orBewitchment. And the latter is a Work opposite thereunto, whose Effect forumlateth itself by direct Creationin the Sphere of its Purpose and Intent. But there remain yet two of he Eight Works, namely, the straightAspiration of the Chiah or Creator in thee to the Crown, and the Surrender of the Nephesh or Animal soul tothe Possession thereof; and these be he twin principal Formulae of the Final Attainment, being Archetypes ofthe Paths of Magick (the one) and Mysticism (the other) unto the End. From each of these Eight Works isderived a separate Mode of practical Use, each after his Kind; and it should be well for thine Instruction ifthou study upon hese my Words, and found upon them a System.

Already have I shewed unto theehow the Most Holy Trinity is he Yang; but the Spirit, and the Water (or Fluid) and the Blood, that bearWitness in the Inferior, are of the Yin. Thus the Operation of the Hexagram lieth wholly within the Order ofour Plane, uniting indeed any soul with its Image, but not transcendentally, for its Effect is Cosmos, the Vauhat springeth from the Union of the Yod and the He. Thus is it but a Glyph of that first Formula, not of theothers. But of all these Things shalt thou thyself make Study with ardent Affection; for therein lie manyMysteries of practical Wisdom in our Magick Art. And this is the Wonder and Beauty of this Work, that forevery Man is his own Palace. Yea, this is Life, that the Secrets of our Order are not fixed and dead, as are theFormulae of the Outer. Know that in the many thousand Times that I have performed the Ritual of thePentagram or the Invocation of the Heart girt with a Serpent, or the Mass of he Phoenix, or of the HolyGhost, there has not been one Time wherein I did not win new Light, or Knowledge or Power or Virtue, savethrough mine own Weakness or Error.{Delta }{epsilon } DE SUA FEMINA OLUN, ET DE ECSTASIA PRAETER OMNIA.My Son, I am enflamed with Love.

Yea, and more also, it is anecessary Rubric in this Ritual of Perfection. Turn not therefore away thine Eyes, for that they are too pure tobehold Evil; but look upon Evil with Joy, comprehending it in he Fervour of this Light that I have enkindledin thy Mind.

And it is this, to create by Artifice a Conflict in thyself, that thou mayst take thy Pleasure in itsResolution.

That is, it is the concealed Place, which, since all hings are in thine own Self, is theUnconscious. How then? Because Men were already aware how this Unconscious, or Libido, is opposed, forthe most Part , to the conscious Will. In the Salve−Ages this is a Truth Universal, or well night to it; for insuch Times are Men compelled to Uniformity by the Constraint of Necessity herself. Yea, of old it was acontinual Siege of every Man of every Clan, of every Environment; and to relax guard was then Self−murdr,or also Treachery. so then no Man might chose his way, until he were Hunter, Fighter, Builder; not anyWoman, but she must first be Breeder. Now in the Growth of States by Organisation came, steppingstealthily, a certain Security against the grossest Perils, so that a few Men could be spared from Toil tocultivate Wisdom, and this was first provided by the Selection of a caste Pontifical. By this Device came theAlliance of King and Priest, Strength and Cunning fortifying each the other through the Division of Labour.{Delta }{tau } DE ORDINE CIVITATUM.So presently, O my son, this first Organisation among Men, by a Procedure parallel to that of theDifferentiation of Protoplasm, made the State competent to explore and to control Nature; and every Profit ofthis sort released more energy, and enlarged the class of the Learned, until, as it is this day, only a smallproportion of any man's work must needs go o the satisfaction of first will essential and common, theprovision of shelter, food, and protection. Verily, also thou seest many women made free to live as they will,even o the admiration and delight of the Sage whose eye laugheth to contemplate mischief. Thus the duty ofevery Unit towards the whole is diminished, and also the necessity to conform with hose narrow laws whichpreserve primitive tribes in their struggle against environment. Thus the State need suppress only suchheresies as directly threaten its political stability, only such modes of life as work manifest and proven hurt toothers, or cause general disorder by their scandal. Therefore save and except he interferes thereby with theroot laws of common weal, a man is free to develop as he will according to his true nature.

Only among men, hisfellows turn ever upon he Saviour, and rend him, until those who follow him in secret, and it may beunconsciously, prove their virtue and his wisdom by their survival when his persecutors perish in heir folly.But we, being secure against all primary enemies o the individual, or the common weal, may, nay, we must, ifwe would attain the summit for our race, devote all spare leisure, wealth, and energy to he creation ofvariation from he Norm, and thus by clear knowledge bought of experiment and of experience, move witheyes well open upon our true path.

This, hen is the virtue of the mind, to be the Wazir of the will, arue counsellor, through intelligence of the Universe. But o, my Son, do thou lay this word beneath thineheart, that the mind hath no will, nor right thereto, so the Usurpation bringeth forth a fatal conflict in thyself.For the mind is sensitive, unstable as air, and may be led foolishly in leash by a stronger mind that worketh asthe cunning tool of a will.

Let then his tutor thee in thine own Art of Magick, that thou employWomen in all Practical Matters, to order them with Cunning, but Men in thy Need of Transfiguration orTransmutation. In a Trope, let the Woman direct the Chess−Play of Life, but the Man alter the Rules, if he sowill. Lo! in ill Play is Mischief and Disorder, but in a New Law is Earthquake, and Destruction of the Root ofThings. Therefore is Fear of any Man that is in Commerce with his Genius, for none knoweth if his Law shallamend the Game or do it Hurt; and of this the Proof is in Experience, won after the Victory of his Will, whenthere is no Way of Return; as saith the Poet, Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum. Nor do thou fear to create: for, evenas I have written in \"The Book of Lies (falsely so−called)\", thou canst create nothing that is not God.

Of its three Modes, the Scorpio destroyeth himself, asif it were a Type of animal Pleasure.

ThisGoat is called also Strength, and standeth in the Meridian at the Sunrise of Spring; and it is His Nature to leapupon the Mountains. So herefore he is a Symbol of true Magick, and his Name is Baphomet, wherefore did Idesign him as an Atu of Thoth, the Fifteenth, and put his Image in the Front of my Book, the \"Ritual of HighMagick\", which was the second Part of my Thesis for the Grade of Major Adept, when I was clothed aboutwith he Body called Alphonse Louis Constant. Now the Goat flieth not as doth the Eagle; but consider thisalso that it is the rue Nature of Man to dwell upon the Earth, so that his Flights are oft but Phantasy; yea, theEagle also is bound to his Eyrie, nor feedeth upon Air.

Thus is hy Will frustrated, and thy Minddistracted, and thy Work lamed, if it be not brought to Naught. Also thy Puissance in hine Art isminished, bya full Moiety, as I do esteem it. But the Eye of Horus hath no Need, and is free in his Will, not seeking aLevel, or requiring a Medicine, and is fit and worthy to be the Companion and the Ally of thee in thy Work,as a Friend to thee, not Mistress and not Slave, that seek ever with Slyness and Deceit to encompass theirown Ends.

Now this Ox is the Letter Aleph, and is that Atu of Thoth whose Numberis Zero, and whose name is Maat, Truth, or Maut, the Vulture, he All−Mother, being an Image of Our LadyNuith, but also it is called the Fool, who is Parsifal, \"der reine Tor\", and so referreth to him thatwalketh in theWay of the Tao.

Then about Himwere little Crosses, Greek, over−running the Heaven. These changed from Form to Form geometrical, Marveldevouring Marvel, a Thousand Times a Thousand in their Course and Sequence, until by their Movement wasthe Universe churned into the Quintessence of Light. Moreover at another Time did I behold All Things asBubbles, iridescent and luminous, self−shining in every Colour, Myriad pursuing Myrad until by theirperpetual Beauty they exhausted the Virtue of my Mind to receive them, and whelmed it, so that I was fain towithdraw myself from the Burden of that Brilliance.

Also, such was the multiplicity of these Ladders,and their Equivalence, that the Memory holdeth no more any one of them, but only a certain Comprehensionof the Method, wordless by Reason of its Subtilty.

For in it is an Implication of our SecretEnlightenment, concerning the Universe, how its Nature is utterly Perfection. Now every Thought is aSeparation, and he Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its Contradiction, as I have shewed formerlyin many Writings. And thou shalt clap the one to the other with Vehemence of Spirit, swiftly as Light itself,that the Ecstasy be spontaneous. So therefore it is Expedient that thou have ravelled already in this Path ofAntithesis, knowing perfectly the Answer to every Griph or Problem, and thy Mind ready therewith. For bythe Property of this Grass all passeth with Speed incalculable of Wit, and an Hesitation should confound thee,breaking down thy ladder, and throwing back thy Mind to receive Impression from Environment, as at hyfirst beginning. Verily; the nature of this Method is Solution, and the Destruction of every Complexity byExplosion of Ecstasy, as every Element thereof is fulfilled by its Correlative, and is annihilated (since itloseth separate Existence) in the Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed of hy Mind.{Digamma }{psi } SEQUITUR DE HAC RE.Thou knowest right well, o my Son, how a Thought is imperfect in two Dimensions, being separate from itsContradiction, but also constrained in its Scope, because by hat Contradiction we do not (commonly)complete the Universe, save only that of its Discourse. Thus if we contrast health with Sickness, we includein their Sphere of Union no more han one Quality that may be predicated of all Things. Furthermore, it is forthe most Part not easy to find or to formulate the true Contradiction of any Thought as a positive Idea, butonly as a Formal Negation in vague Terms, so that he ready Answer is but the Antithesis. Thus to \"White\"one putteth not the Phrase \"all that which is not white\", for this is void, formless, neither clear, simple, norpositive in conception; but one answereth \"BBlack\", for this hath an Image of his Significance. So theCohesion of Antitheticals destroyeth them only in Part, and one becometh instantly conscious of the Residuethat is unsatisfied or unbalanced, whose Eidolon leapeth in thy Mind with Splendour and Joy unspeakable.Let not this deceive thee, for its Existence proveth its Imperfection, and thou must call forth its Mate, anddestroy them by Love, as with the former.

Thus the Word \"Long\" hath no Meaning save it bereferred to a Standard; but Love is not thus obscure, because Hate is its Twin, partaking bountifully of aCommon Nature therewith. Now, hear this; it was given unto me in my Visions of the Aethyrs, when I was inhe Wilderness of Sahara, by Tolga, that above the Abyss, contradiction is Unity, and that Nothing could betrue save by Virtue of the Contradiction that is contained in itself.

Now there is the Restraint ofConflict which is Impotance and Disruption; the he Restraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will byRepose and by Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his Armies, and feedeth them, and looketh to theirFurniture and to their Spirit, before he joineth the Battle. Also, there is the Restraint of Art, which includeththat other of Discipline, and its Nature is to adorn the Will and to admire its Strength and its Beauty, and toenjoy its Victory by Anticipation in full Confidence, not fearful of Time that robbeth them that are ignorantconcerning him, how he is but Mirage and Illusion, incapable to besiege the Fortress of the Soul. Work houthy Will, as I said aforetime by the Mouth of Eliphas Levi Zahed, knowing thyself Omnipotent, and thineHabitation Eternity.

Now, o my Son, the fullComprehension of this Arcanum is the Fruit of Contemplation, if this be prepared by the Experience of thisArt in thine own Case. But to them that understand not, and have Grief and Separation, being deceived bythis Play so that they deem it he Division of Hate, She can but speak in Simplicity by that Word written in\"The Book of the Law\": \"To me!\" For until thou love, the Play of Love is but Emptiness; and its cruelty isCruelty indeed, except thou know it to be but a Sauce to wet Appetite, and to give Emphasis of Contrast, as aPainter dimmeth the Light by Cunning of his Shadows. But all this Delight that thou mayst have of theUniverse both in its Veils and in its Nakedness is a Reward of thine Attainment of Truth, and followeth afterit.

Therefore the Pain of any Sinner in his Division and HisSeparation is to Her a little Spasm of Pleasure. But as for him, let him apprehend this Doctrine, and dissolvehimself in Her Love. Thou then, being Initiate and Illuminated in this Truth, mayst accept thine own Sorrow,or rather that of thy Vehicle, as Lackey to the Joy hat thou hast in thy True Self, the Star among the Stars ofHer Body. The Adept of our Art is not compassionate concerning Sin, in his own Vehicle or another's, unlessthe Healing thereof were proper to his Will, for he is aware of he whole Truth of the Matter. So goeth heupon his Way, and ighteneth not a Rein upon the Horses of the Universe, but is content, beholding the Speedof their Course.

Nor do they see that theyrestrict their God (whom yet hey would have to be All) by admitting Opposites to this Nature, ever when theysum these Opposites as Illusion, since Illusion is the Denial of His Truth.

And her eagerness of purity doth encompass me with its soft enderness, and twineth about me with sweetscent so that my mind is enkindled with a gentle flame, luminous and subtle, and I write unto thee as in adream; for in this enchantment of her devotion I am caught up cunningly into beautitude, with great joy of theGods that have bestrewn my way with flowers, ay many flowers and herbs of magick and of holiness withal Liber Aleph vel CXI{Epsilon }{iota } RHAPSODIA DE DOMINA NOSTRA.58"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"to match their beauty. Nay, o my son, I will cease this epistle unto thee for awhile, that I may rest in thepleasure of this contemplation, for it is solace ineffable, and recreation like unto sleep among the mountains.Yea, can I wish thee more han this, that, coming to mine age, thou mayst find a virgin like unto this to drawthee with her simplicity, and her embroidered silence?{Epsilon }{nu } DE CONSTANTIA AMORIS, CORVO CANDIDO.Think it not strange, my Son, that I, praising adultery, should praise also constancy and delight therein. Forthis is o state ill thy question. Herein is truth and wisdom concerning this matter, that so long as love be notwholly satisfied, and equilibrated by entire fulfilment and exchange, constancy is a point of thy concentrationand adultery a division in thy will. But when thou hast the summit and perfection of any work, of what worthis it to continue herein? Hast thou two stomachs, as has a cow, to chew the cud of a digested love? Yet, o mySon, this constancy is not of necessity a stagnation. Hay, behold the body of our lady Nuith, therein are foundtwin suns, that revolve constantly about each other. So also it may be in love, that two souls, meeting,discover each in the other such wealth and richness of light and love, and in one phase of life (or incarnation)or even in may, they exhaust not that treasure. Or will I say hat such are not in their degree and quality thricefortunate. But to persist in dulness, in satiety, and in mutual irritation and abhorrence, is contrary to the wayof nature. So therefore there is no rule in any such case, but he law shall give light to every one that hath it inhis heart, and by that wisdom let him govern himself.{Epsilon }{xi } DE MYSTERIO MALL.Moreover, say not thou in thy syllogism that, since every change soever, be it the creation of a symphony, ora poem, or he putrefaction of a carcass, is an art of love, and since we are to make no difference between anything and any other hing, therefore all changes are equal in respect of our praise. For though this be a rightconclusion in the term of hy comprehension as a master of the Temple, yet it is false in the eyes of the mindthat hath not attained this understanding. So therefore any change (or phenomenon) appeareth noble or baseto the imperfect mind, according to its consonance and harmony with the will that governeth the mind. Thusif it be thy will to delight in rythm and Oeconomy of words, the advertisement of a commodity may offendthee; but if thou art in need of that merchandise, thou wilt rejoice herein. Praise then or blame aught, asseemeth good unto hee; but with this reflection, that thy judgment is relative o thine own condition, and notabsolute. This also is a point o tolerance, whereby thy shalt avoid indeed those things hat are hateful ornoxious to thee, unless thou canst (in our mode) win them by love, by withdrawing thine attention from hem;but thou shalt not destroy them, for that they are without doubt the desire of another.{Epsilon }{omicron } DE VIRTUTE TOLERANTIA.Understand then heartily, o my son, that in the light of his my wisdom all things are one, being of the body orour Lady Nuith, proper, necessary and perfect. There is then none superfluous or harmful, and there is nonehonourable or dishonourable more than another. Lo! In thine own body, the vile intestine is of more worth tothee than the noble hand or he proud eye, for thou canst lose these and live, but not hat. Esteem therefore athing in relation to thine own will, preferring the ear if thou love musick, and the palate if thou live wine, butthe essential organs of life above these. Have respect also to the will of thy fellow, not hindering him in hisway save as he may overly jostle thee in thine. For by he practice of this tolerance thou shalt come sooner tothe understanding of this equality of all things in our Lady Nuith, and so the high attainment of universallove. Yet in hy partial and particular action, as thou art a creature of illusion, do thou maintain the right Liber Aleph vel CXI{Epsilon }{nu } DE CONSTANTIA AMORIS, CORVO CANDIDO.59"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"relation of one thing to another; fighting if thou be a soldier, or building if thou be a mason. For if thou holdnot fast this discipline and proportion, which alloweth its true will to every part of thy being, the error of oneshall draw all after it into ruin and dispersion.{Epsilon}{pi} DE FORMULA DEORUM OCCISORUM.Alas, my son! this hath been fatal constantly to many a man of noble aspiration, that these words were hiddenfrom his understanding. For there is a balance in all things and the body hath charter to fulfil his nature, evenas the mind hath. So to repress one function is to destroy that proportion which is wholesome, and whereinindeed all health and sanity have consistency. Verily, it is the art of life to develop each organ of body andmind, or, as I may say, each weapon of the will to its perfection, neither distorting any use, nor suffering thewill of one part to tyrannize over that of another. And this doctrine (be it accursed!) that pain and repressionare wholesome and profitable in themselves is a lie born of sin and of ignorance, the false vision of theUniverse and of its laws that is the basis of the averse formula of the Slain God. It is true that on occassionone limb must be sacrificed to save the whole body, as when one cutteth away one hand that is bitten by aviper, or as when a man giveth his life to save his city. But this is a right and natural subordination of thesuperficial and particular to the fundamental and general will, and moreover it is a case extraordinary,relating to accident or extremity, not in any wise a rule of life, or a virtue in its absolute nature.{Epsilon }{koppa } DE STULTIS MALIGNIS.My Son, there are afflictions many and woes many, that come of the errors of men in respect of the will; butthere is none greater than this, the interference of the busy−body. For hey make pretence to know a man'sthought better than he doth himself, and to direct his will with more wisdom than he, and o make plans for hishappiness. And of all these the worst is he that sacrificeth himself for the weal of his fellows. He that is sofoolish as not to follow his own will, how shall be be so wise as to pursue that of another? If mine horse balkat a fence, should some varlet come behind him, and strike at his hoofs? Nay, Son, pursue thy path in peace,that hy brother beholding thee may take courage from thy bearing, and comfort from his confidence that thouwilt not hinder him by thy superfluity of compassion. Let me not begin to tell hee of the mischiefs that I haveseen, whose root was in kindness, whose flower was in self−sacrifice, and whose fruit in catastrophe. Verily Ithink there should be no end hereof. Strike, rob, slay thy neighbour, but comfort him not unless he ask it ofthee, and if he ask it, be wary.{Epsilon }{rho } APOLOGIA PRO SUIS LITERIS.How then, sayest thou, concerning this my Counsel unto hee? I say Sooth, it is of my will to bring up this myWisdom from its silence into my conscious mind, that I may the more easily reflect thereon. Thou art but apretext for my action, and a focus for my light. Nevertheless heed these my words, for they shall profit thee,thou being of age responsible in judgment, and free in the law of Thelema. Thus hou mayst read or no, concuror no, as thou wilt. Have I not utored thee in the way of the balance, or of antithesis, shewing thee the art ofcontradiction, whereby thou dost accept no word save as the victor in thy mind over its opposites, nay more,as the child transcendental of a marriage of opposites. This book then shall serve thee but as a food for thymeditation, as wine to excite thy mind to love and war. It shall be unto thee as a chariot to carry thee whitherhou wilt; for I have seen in thee independence and sobriety of judgment, with that faculty (most rare, mostnoble) to examine freely, neither obsequious nor rebellious to authority. Liber Aleph vel CXI{Epsilon}{pi} DE FORMULA DEORUM OCCISORUM.60"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"{Epsilon }{sigma } LAUS LEGIS THELEMA.This Property of thy Mind, my Son, is verily of sublime Virtue; for the Vulgar are befogged, and theirJudgment made null, by their emotional Reaction. They are swayed by the Eloquence of a Numscull, oroverpowered by a Name or an Office, or the Magic of a Tailor; else, it may be, they, being made Fools toooften, reject without Reflection even as at first they accepted. Again, they are wont to believe the best of theworst, as Hope or Fear predominateth in them at the Moment. Thus, they lose Touch of the Blade of Reality,and it pierceth them. Then they in Delirium of their Wounds increase Delusion fortifying themselves in Beliefof those Phantasies created by their Emotions or impressed upon their Silliness, so that their Minds have noUnity, or Stability, or Discrimination, but become Hotchpot, and the Garbage−Heap of Choronzon. O mySon, against this the Law of Thelema is a Sure Fortress, for through the Quest of thy True Will the Mind isbalanced about it, and confirmeth its Flight, as the Feathers upon an Arrow, so that thou hast a Touchstone ofTruth, Experience holding thee to Reality, and to Proportion. Now therefore see from yet another Art ofHeaven the Absolute Virtue of Our Law.{Epsilon }{tau } DE SPHINGE AEGYPTIORUM.It is now expedient that I instruct thee concerning the Four Powers of the Sphinx, and firstly, that this mostarcane of the Mysteries of Antiquity was never at any Period the Tool of the Slavegods, but a Witness ofHorus through the dark Aeon of Osiris to His Light and Truth, His Force and Fire. Thou canst by no meansinterpret the Sphinx in Terms of the Formula of the Slain God. This did I comprehend even when as EliphasLevi Zahed I walked up and down the Earth, seeking a Reconciliation of these Antagonisms, which was aTask impossible, for in that Plane they have Antipathy. (Even so may no Man form a Square Magical of FourUnits.) But the Light of the New Aeon revealeth this Sphinx as the true Symbol of this our Holy Art ofMagick under the Law of Thelema. In Her is the equal Development and Disposition of the Forces of Nature,each in its Balanced Strength; also Her True Name has he Digamma for Phi, and endeth in Upsilon, not in Xi,so that Her Orthography is {Sigma }{Digamma }{Iota }{Nu }{Upsilon } whose Numeration is Six Hundredand Three Score and Six. For the Root thereof is {Sigma }{Digamma }, which signifieth the Incarnation ofthe Spirit; and of Kin are not only the Sun, Our Father, but Sumer, where Man knew himself Man, and Soma,the Divine Potion that giveth Men Enlightenment, and Scin, Light Astral, and Scire also, by a far Travelling.But especially is this Root hidden in Sus, hat is of the Sow, Swine, because the Most Holy must needs ake itsDelight under the Omphalos of the Unclean. But this was hidden by Wisdom in Order that the Arcanumshould not be profaned during the Aeon of the Slain God. But now it has been given unto me to understandthe Heart of Her Mystery, wherefore, o my Son, by Right of the Great Love that I bear unto thee, I willinform thee thereof.{Epsilon }{upsilon } DE NATURA {Sigma }{Digamma }{Iota }{Nu }{Upsilon }.Firstly, this Sphinx is a Symbol of the Coition of Our Lady BABALON with me THE BEAST in itsWholeness. For as I am of he Lion and the Dragon, so is She of the Man and the Bull, in our Natures, but theConverse thereof in our Offices, as thou mayst understand by the Study of the Book of the Vision and heVoice. It is thus a Glyph of the Satisfaction and Perfection of the Will and of the Work, the completion of theTrue Man as the Reconcilor of the Highest with the Lowest, so for our Convenience conventionally todistinguish them. This hen is the Adept, who doth Will with solid Energy as the Bull, doh dare with fierceCourage as the Lion, doth know with swift Intelligence as the Man, and doth keep Silence with soaring Liber Aleph vel CXI{Epsilon }{sigma } LAUS LEGIS THELEMA.61"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Subtilty as the Eagle or Dragon. Moreover, this Sphinx is an Eidolon of the Law, for the Bull is Life, the Lionis Light, the Man is Liberty, the Serpent Love. Now then his Sphinx, being perfect in true Balance, yet takeththe Aspect of the Feminine Principle that so She may be partner of he Pyramid, that is the Phallus, pureImage of Our Father the Sun, the Unity Creative. The Signification of this Mystery is hat the Adept must beWhole, Himself, containing all Things in true Proportion, before he maketh himself Bride of the OneUniversal Transcendental, in its most Secret Virtue. And now herefore, o my Son, comprehending thisMystery by thine Intelligence, I will write further unto thee of these your Beasts of Power.{Epsilon }{phi } DE TAURO.Concerning the Bull, this is thy Will, constant and unwearied, whose Letter is Vau, which is Six, the Numberof he Sun. He is therefore the Force and the Substance of thy Being; but besides this, he is the Hierophant inthe Taro, as if this were said: \"that thy Will leadeth thee unto the Shrine of Light.\" And in the Rites ofMithras the Bull is slain, and his Blood poured upon the Initiate, to endow him with that Will and that Powerof Work. Also in the land of Hind is the Bull sacred to Shiva, that is God among that Folk, and is unto hemthe Destroyer of all Things that be opposed to Him. And his God is also the Phallus, for this Will operateththrough Love even as it is written in our Own Law. Yet again, Apis he Bull of Khem hath Kephra the Beetleupon His tongue, which signifieth that it is by this Will, and by this Work, that the Sun cometh unto Dawnfrom Midnight. All these Symbols are most similar in their Nature, save as the Slaves of the Slave− godshave read their own Formula into the Simplicity of Truth. For there is naught so plain that Ignorance andMalice may not confuse and misinterpret it, even as the Bat is dazzled and bewildered by the Light of theSun. See then that thou understand this Bull in Terms of the Law of this our Aeon of Life.{Epsilon }{chi } DE LEONE.Of this, Lion, o my Son, be it said that this is the Courage of thy Manhood, leaping upon all Things, andseizing hem for their Prey. His letter is Teth, whose Implication is a Serpent, and the Number thereof Nine,whereof is Aub, the secret Fire of Obeah. Also Nine is of Jesod, uniting Change with Stability. But in the\"Book of Thoth\" He is the Atu called Strength, whose Number is ELEVEN which is Aud, the Lifht Odic ofMagick. And therein is figured the Lion, even THE BEAST, and Our Lady BABALON with Her Hands uponHis Mouth, that She may master Him. Here I would have thee to mark well how these our Symbols arecognate, and flow forth the one into the other, because each Soul partaketh in proper Measure of the Mysteryof Holiness, and is kin with his Fellow. But now let me show how this Lion of Courage is more especially theLight in thee, as Leo is the House of the Sun that is the Father of Light. And it is thus: that thy Light,conscious of itself, is the Source and Instigator of thy Will, enforcing it to spring forth and conquer.Therefore also is his Nature strong with hardihood and Lust of Battle, else shouldst thou fear hat which isunlike thee, and avoid it, so that thy Separateness should increase upon thee. For this Cause he hat isdefective in Courage becometh a Black Brother, and to Dare is the Crown of all thy Virtue, the Root of theTree of Magick.{Epsilon }{psi } ALTERA DE LEONE.Lo! In the first of thine Initiations, when first the Hoodwink was uplifted from before thine Eyes, thou wastbrought unto the Throne of Horus, the Lord of the Lion, and by Him enheartened against Fear. Moreover, inMinutum Mundum, the Map of the Universe, it is the Path of the Lion that bindeth he two Highest Facultiesof thy Mind. Again, it is Mau, the Sun at Brightness of high Noon, that is called the Lion, very lordly, in our Liber Aleph vel CXI{Epsilon }{phi } DE TAURO.62"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Holy Invocation. Sekhet our Lady is figured as a lioness, for that She is that Lust of Nuith toward Hadithwhich is the Fierceness of the Night of the Stars, and their Necessity; whence also is She true Symbol of thineown Hunger of Attainment, the Passion of thy Light to dare all for its Fulfilling. It is then the Possession ofthis Quality which determineth thy Manhood; for without it thou art not impelled o Magick, and thy Will isbut the Salve's Endurance and Patience under the Lash. For this Cause, the Bull being of Osiris, was itnecessary for the Masters of the Aeons to incarnate me as more especially a lion, and my Word is first of all aWord of Enlightenment and of Emancipation of the Will, giving to every Man a Sprint within Himself todetermine His Will, that he may do that Will, and no more another's. Arise therefore, o my son, arm thyself,haste to the Battle!{Epsilon }{omega } DE VIRO.Learn now that this Lion is a natural Quality in Man, and secret, so that he is not ware thereof, except he beAdept. Therefore is it necessary for thee also to know, by the Head of the Sphinx. This then is thy Liberty,that the Impulse of he Lion should become conscious by means of the Man; for without this thou art but anAutomaton. This Man moreover maketh thee to understand and to adjust thyself with Environment, elsebeing devoid of Judgment, thou goest blindly upon an headlong Path. For every Star in his Orbit holdeth nothis Way obstinately, but is sensitive to every other Star, and his true Nature is to do this. Oh how many arethey whom I have seen persisting in a fatal Course, in Sway of the Belief that their dead Rigidity wasExercise of Will. And the Letter of the Man is Tzaddi, whose Number is Ninety; which is Maim, the Waterthat conformeth itself perfectly with its Vessel, that seeketh constantly its Level, that penetrateth anddissolveth Earth, that resisteth Pressure maugre its Adaptability, that being heated is the Force to drive greatEngines, and being frozen breaketh the Mountains in Pieces.
