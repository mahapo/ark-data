Dismiss from your mind the impetuous course of the Moon, for she moveth always by the power of Necessity. The pro-gression of the Stars was not generated for your sake.

BY Essential Dignity is meant the strength of a figure when found in a particular House. A figure is therefore strongest in what is called its House; very strong in its Exaltation; strong in its Triplicity; very weak in its Fall; weakest of all in its Detriment. A figure is in its Fall when in a House opposite to that of its Exaltation; in is Detriment when opposite to its own House. The following list shows the Essential Dignities; that is to say, they follow the Dignities of their Ruling Planets, considering the twelve Houses of the scheme as answering to the twelve signs, thus: Asc. to a, 2 to b, 3 to c, &c., . . . 12 to l.

Destroy it instantly, and erect a new figure not less than two hours afterwards. Your figure being thoroughly arranged as on p. 6, note first to what House the demand belongs. Then look for Witnesses and Judge in their special table, and see what is said under the head of the demand. Put this down. Note next what figure falls into the House required (if it spring into other Houses, these too should be considered); e.g. in a question of money stolen, if the figure in 2nd be also in 6th it might show the thief to be a servant in the house. Look next in the Table of Figures in the Houses, and see what the figure signifies in the especial House under consideration. Put this down also. Then by the Table of Aspects (p. 20) note down the figures Â À D and Á, putting good on one side, evil on the other; noting also the strength or weakness, friendliness or hostility to the figure of the House required, of these figures. Then add the meaning of the figure in the 4th, to signify the end of the matter. It may also assist you to form a Reconciler from the figure in the House required and the Judge, noting what figure results and whether it harmonises with one or both by nature (p. 20). Now consider all you have written, and according to the balance of Good and Evil, form your final judgement. Consider also always in money questions where the Part of Fortune falls. Take, e.g., the figure on p. 6, and form a judgement for loss of money in business therefrom. Table of Witnesses and Judge say: Moderate. In 2nd is x. Evil, showing obstacle, delay. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"LIBER GAIAS 22 Part of Fortune , is in Asc. with v, showing loss through Querent’s own blunders. x springs into no other Houses; ∴ this does not affect the question. The figures Â and D of 2nd are w, t, s, and u, all good figures and friendly in nature = Well-intentioned help of friends. The figures À and Á are t, w, {, which are not hostile to x; therefore shows opposition not great. The figure in the 4th is t, which shows a good end, but with anxiety. Forming a Reconciler we get t again, a sympathetic figure but denoting delay = Delay, but helping Querent’s wishes. Adding all together— 1. Medium. 2. Evil and obstacles, delay; 3. Loss through Querent’s self; 4. Strength for evil, medium only; 5. Well-intentioned aid of friends; 6. Not much opposition from enemies. 7. Ending good, but with anxiety; 8. Delay, but helping Querent’s wishes— we formulate this judgement: That the Querent’s loss in business has been principally owing to his own mismanagement; that he will have a long and hard struggle, but will meet with help from friends; that his obstacles will gradually give way; and that after much anxiety he will eventually recoup himself for his previous losses. *** ***** *** "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 24 Transcriber’s notes. This text was first published in Equinox I (2) in 1909. That publication was prefixed by a note reading: This MS is now first printed from the private copies of certain adepts, after careful examination and collation. It is printed for the information of scholars and the instruction of seekers. By the order of the A∴A∴ certain formulæ have been introduced into it, and omissions made, to baffle any one who seeks to prostitute it to idle curiosity or to fraud. Its practical use and the method of avoiding these pitfalls will be shown to approved students by special authority from V.V.V.V.V. or his delagates. This work derives in the first instance from a lecture on Geomancy which circulated in the Golden Dawn. Another version was published by F.I. Regardie in the two versions of the G.D. papers he edited; both of these however omitted the tables of Witnesses and Judge, though they included material omitted by Crowley. The method is in most respects similar to that taught in the Geomantica disciplina lectura by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa which appeared in vol. I of the Lyon edition of Agrippa’s Opera and was one of the six texts on magic and divination from that volume translated into English by Robert Turner (Henry Cornelius Agrippa’s Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy and of Geomancy &c. &c. &c., London, 1655) although elements appear to have been drawn from other late-mediæval and Renaissance works on the subject (the sigils of the planetary spirits and the tables of witness and judge, for instance, are not in Agrippa or the other short work on Geomancy, attributed to Gerald of Cremona, which was bound up in Agrippa’s Opera; the attributions of the figures to the signs of the Zodiac differ in a couple of cases). Geomantic divination is possibly of African or Middle Eastern origin: systems of divination employing the same set of figures have been recorded in West Africa and Malagasy, though these lack the elaboration of Agrippa’s method. Traditionally the figures would be obtained by making the marks in sand or dry earth with a stick rather than on paper. The quotation at the beginning attributed to “Zoroaster” is from the Chaldæan Oracles and forms fragment 144 in the Westcott edition (fragment 64 in the Kroll collection); it was quoted in the works of Michael Psellos, the Byzantine Platonist."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"A HANDBOOK OF GEOMANCY 25 The MACANEH square is from The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, Book III, cap. X, its is said to “hinder Sorcerers from operating.” The drawings which appear at the start and end are by Austin Spare, who at the time was a probationer of A∴A∴ (Spare contributed two other illu-strations to that issue of the Equinox, namely renditions of the Golden Dawn Eden diagrams). The sigils of the planetary spirits as used in Geomancy differ from the forms obtained by plotting their names on the planetary “magic squares,” and were deliberately omitted by Crowley when editing the lecture. Regardie gives them as follows (I have not so far managed to find an earlier source): Saturn Zazel  1 Jupiter Hismael 2 Mars Bartzabel 3 Sol Sorath 4 Venus Kedemel 5 Mercury Taphtartharath 6 Luna Chasmodai 7 The “appropriate Pentagram” (p. 4) is an invoking Earth pentagram, traced with the first stroke from top to bottom left. To clarify the rules for obtaining the remaining figures from the three Mothers (p. 5): the first Daughter is composed of the first row of each of the four Mothers in turn, the second from the second row of each, etc. (that is: row x of Daughter y is taken from row y of Mother x). Then figures are combined in pairs as stated by modulo 2 addition: i.e. take each row in turn: if the total number of dots in that row in the two figures is odd, one dot is marked in the corresponding row of the new figure. If the total number is even, mark two dots in the new figure. Note that owing to the method used to generate it, the Judge will always have an even number of points; if the total number of marks made when gen-erating the original four figures was even, both Witnesses will have an even number of points, otherwise they will both have an odd number of points. In the table of Essential Dignities on pp. 19-20, the geomantic figures were originally represented by binary numbers (1111 for Via, 1112 for Cauda Draconis, etc.). To explain the how this table was constructed: for each"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"LIBER GAIAS 26 house take the Zodiac sign corresponding (Aries for the ascendant, Taurus for the second house, etc.). In the column “House” place those figures that fall under the planet ruling the sign in question. Caput Draconis is placed with signs ruled by either Venus or Jupiter; Cauda Draconis with signs ruled by either Mars or Saturn. In the column “Exaltation” place the figures corresponding to the planet exalted in the sign in question; since the nodes of the moon are included in the scheme of exaltations, they are placed there and not with Saturn, Jupiter, Mars or Venus. In “Triplicity”, rather than following the Elements in the first table, place figures under Sol and Jupiter (including Caput Draconis) with Fire signs, figures under Luna and Venus (including Caput Draconis) with Water signs, figures under Saturn and Mercury (including Cauda Draconis) with Air signs, and figures under Mars (including Cauda Draconis) with Water signs. The remaining two columns are straightforward if one bears in mind that a planet is in its fall in a sign opposite one where it is exalted, and in its detriment in a sign opposite one it rules. The system taught in Gerald of Cremona’s Astronomical Geomancy differs radically from the Agrippa / G.D. approach. In this, a single Geomancy figure is obtained in the usual way, and the Zodiac sign corresponding placed in the Ascendent: the remaining 11 signs are then placed around the figure in their usual order (Gerard has a somewhat different set of Zodiacal attributions to Agrippa; but in any case the fact that there are 16 figures and 12 Signs mean some signs are more likely to occur than others); then for each of the Planets (in order ! \" $ # ' & %), and Caput Draconis, make four rows of points but instead of using these to obtain another figure, count up the total number of points and divide by twelve; take the remainder (or 12, if the number is exactly divisible by 12) and place that planet in the house corresponding. Cauda Draconis, obviously, is placed opposite Caput Draconis. This gives you an artificial astrological figure which can then be judged according to the rules for aspects, planets in signs and houses, etc. The Latin title and number (96 being the total number of points in the 16 figures of Geomancy) are as given in the Syllabus of the Official Instructions of A∴A∴ in Equinox I (10). ~"}]
