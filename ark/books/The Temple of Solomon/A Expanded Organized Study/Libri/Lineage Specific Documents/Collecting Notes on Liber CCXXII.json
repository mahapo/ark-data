[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Collecting Notes on Liber CCXXII What follows are conversational notes during the creation of Liber 222 between the two working on the document and two others with some interest. These notes are meant to give insight into the creative qabalistic process. * I am glad you are open to new ideas, especially ones that alter established theories. I have been sitting on this and working with it for a little while just to get the wrinkles ironed out. I think my scheme and method is good, however the proof of the whole thing is in the results. I don't have results yet but with adding new words and phrases to a compendium of number sums should allow us to make a more scientific decision. At present I can't imagine it not yielding the desired results. It has been quite exciting to see several find my ideas to spark their own creativity. When Ryan came out with Liber 27 and Paul used a similar technique to examine Liber AL, things simply got richer for us all. You’ve now come along and added to this and I am exultant over this. I’m especially delighted to see that you’ve been working so hard at it...and that you’ve got an obvious Qabalistic talent. My ideas are riding on the shoulders of a lot of people. ...the big secret that the copyright obsessed don’t want anyone to find out is that all our ideas are “riding...” as you say. The only originality is the love you put into the work...that originates from you. Those that go chasing copyrights aren’t practicing love and the ‘will’ part of the formula becomes a nasty distortion. Per results: we can see an egregore already growing steady with this and brainstorm on this and help it to grow. From my initial read of your post, I can see going directly into Liber 805 and including the formula you’ve found—but I think it even more stimulating that you compose an ‘alternate’ document so that ultimately, we’ll be chasing both lines to their natural ends. I'm on it. I'll get you a tentative draft as quickly as possible. I'm going to site references strait out of the gate as prerequisites and then bust the material wide open. I would like someone to double check my work, especially the order of the letters against Liber Legis and the sums in the calculator before a lot of work is thrown in the wrong direction. I have already calculated a list of words incorrectly due to an oversight on my part. I don't want to repeat that years from now and throw an entire book of number sums in the trash & start over because of a ridiculous error or programming bug. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Welcome to ‘hard work’ of Qabalah  That you obviously have the facility to be self-critical in your work; when there are so many out there that take all their initial errors and elevate them to their self-admiring ‘inspirational genius’ – well, that’s why there’s so much crap on the web in both Thelema and the spiritual community in general. They have no critical perspective. Most of this information is second hand. I have merely researched & recompiled with the exception of the new Tree of Life diagram I am proposing. All information is “second-hand” (there’s nothing new under the Sun)...just that there’s a lot of jerks out there that think they own their ‘inspirational genius.’ We always build upon what’s out there as our Gnosis continually evolves. So I don’t care about what person copyrighted whatever...just that you’ve put it together in a creative and intelligible manner. And I would be very interested in exploring your new ToL diagram. I heard about the 'initiated' scheme of Sephira from a podcast by Poke Runyon. Not exactly the kind of reference you'd site on a university thesis -- Being a Probationer, I have no idea if this is true or not. I guess it doesn't matter if it works -- success is the proof. Even the calculator was pilfered and re-wired. I don't believe in reinventing the wheel. (me neither ) I do take credit for discovering how 27 paths can be formulated with this 'initiated' scheme and the combination of the two popular diagrams -- the Jewish and Hermetic (I don't know the technical names) as Liber Legis directs. I do think that is a novel idea. Again, I’ll be eager to hear about this and the list would be a great place to discuss this. I’ll probably come at this with some initial skepticism, as these traditional paths are well-explored modes of consciousness...tried and proved over many centuries of exploration. But I always recognize that new Gnosis always butts at the foundations of the old Gnosis. These paths are only new on the surface. In the past we have chosen between the one diagram and the other. I’m aware of some early versions of the Tree...an interesting book on Qabalah, by Charles Ponce gives some of these; but more along the lines of the Sefirot and not the lesser paths...I’d love some material on this if you have any. There’s also something in my memory that I don’t believe I’ve retained in my archives (though I might have) where someone proposed adding some additional lines within (if I remember correctly) the Ruach...or even that it was through Da’ath as you describe below...my memory is a bit hazy here. My understanding is they are derived from the Zohar & the other from Sepher Yetzirah, the Jewish and Hermetic diagrams respectively. I am only combining the two into one. Then I take the heretical step of declaring Da'ath as a Sepiroth in its own right and dividing the 3 paths through it into six. I understand that even this reassignment of Sephira is established, but in secret. I wonder how contrived this whole"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pseudo-Sephiroth doctrine really is? Sounds like a blind to me. Sounds like the sort of thing Abrahamic religions do to promulgate slavery. They corrupt the knowledge and cut off half their children's dicks for the sake of appeasing a desert god. We are fallen and vile and there is a barrier between us and God? The vices of bragging & humility aside, I think our lineage will bring the English QBL that Liber Legis promised! Liber Legis said that this would not come from any expected house, I'm sure you know. Some real interesting thoughts here...I can’t wait to see your document. And I understand your point, re: Da’ath...also see it as simply a gate (sotospeak) in this one, I see PAN as the beautiful image moving downwards into manifestation, which looks quite hideous moving upwards as one attempts to flee manifestation—that not being the way of the godhead. It’s the shadow of this light that is ‘outside the thought’ of the godhead (as well described in ancient Gnostic literature: cf. my epistles on these documents: http://www.gclvx.org/?p=874) In The Red Goddess, by Peter Grey, he suggests that the Abyss is a further initiation into enlightenment and one that was given attention in modern Occultism as they ancients were only concerned with Tiphareth. I’m not all that certain about that, but it’s an interesting thought. But certainly that which is outside the thought of the godhead is the ‘nightside’ as well contemplated by Kenneth Grant (I’ve several writings on inspired by his work). And from here, we can even deduce an ‘anti-godhead’ that is much the origin of the N.O.X. and which eventually diffused into the material universe...the gross moving to the fine as the godhead is the L.V.X. seeking involution (the fine moving to the gross)...and of the whole, one great eucharist. It is the Aeon of the Child. Crowley spoke of the coming wave of children obsessed with children's games. I mentioned this to Ann and she said there was a difference between the childish and the childlike. Perhaps that is our dichotomy in this Aeon. A little more on subject, I think these lineages are satisfied to ride on the coat tails of those who may have known the Beast. Maybe Crowley's milk man should have started a lineage. A student of a student of a student... A copy of a copy. We are actually lucky to have this conversation. I almost joined your friend, Ray Eales', group. Divine intervention, perhaps. Well yes, it’s all about coattails (“I gave Crowley a blow-job and he put his spiritual essence in my mouth and I swallowed.”)..Ray would often say... “ it doesn’t matter that it’s right or wrong, it’s how Motta did it...it’s how we do it.” And he would use that to cover all sorts of inaccuracies and understandings that became apparent in his own philosophizing. So he knew Motta...well, I met Mel Stottlemeyer in my barbershop (we both had the same barber) when I was 8 years old...but I didn’t grow up to pitch for the Yankees. These sycophants are empty of spirit; exactly as Motta described when he wrote that when the Master dies, he abandons the current, which is why you don’t worship dead men...and also why you should become the master! ... after all, we are all gods!!! Of course, both Ray and Motta preach this crap that there is an ‘office of the Beast’ and that they each in turn, were/are the physical light of the Sun on Earth...as if Ray’s death without a successor would mean a day where the Sun fails to rise. Basically, like the Caliphate, they are trying to create a Papal succession...yet, they’ll run around complaining how Christist everyone else is."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Likewise. I will write what I can before venturing into these documents. If I stray into reading now nothing will be written. Seems like things are converging into a point and I am honored to have a part in it. I think so also...I’ve been considering my solution to the riddle in accord with this and the two recent documents I’ve added to the archives on this: THE RIDDLE SOLVED THE KEY TO AL & ITS THRSHRQ 93-ITS THRSHRQ & COMPLEMENT And I’ve been speaking with my Students for some time now about the fact that I don’t see any lineage but one; besides ours that produces new Gnosis—and that doesn’t make sense to me, as this is the key to Magickal work. Haven’t all these so-called Thelemites read Crowley? Why do they constantly play “My daddy’s bigger than your daddy?” I think if we can do this it will prove the validity of Thelema, revolutionize occultism, and promulgate the Law. No one could deny after that. Our Law and our Book are exactly what they say they are! It will make the study of other languages for the sake of Gematria purely optional to the English speaker. I think this new Tree of Life scheme when drawn out and presented is going to be devastating! There's going to be a lot of gnashing of teeth! At this point I think it is absolutely a true scheme, and as such will be all the more despised of our brothers and sisters. Sorry if I'm going over the top, but I'm excited about the mischief implied in this. I think also that English as the new holy language; made also the international language by America’s dominance in the world heralds much for us to consider. First, English has replaced Latin (and hence, Rome as the spiritual center) and second, it’s American English with the original doctrine of the divine right of all men and the Declaration of Independence as a herald of AL. However, I don’t know about revolutionizing Occultism—more about simply getting back to the true practice, which has been lost in a plethora of glamour seekers. (Say the Magick word, win fifty bucks.) I should clarify my statement. I define occultism as an understanding of a hidden truth. I think this will revolutionize aspects of the understanding, but leave the truth as it ever is/was/will be. You will probably have to provide some direction for me in writing a formal document. I don't really know the ins and outs of such a thing. I am not very good with anything of a formal nature. I would like to get this information out there into the hands of our fellow Thelemites, and occultists in general, and let it succeed or fail under its own power & merit in the light of day. You’ve already started writing it...what you sent me is a great start...expand your idea and show the full scope of it (including your ToL ideas). To help you with this, start discussing your ideas on the list...we can then work together on an organizational outline to collate the ideas...and with that, the document"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"will practically write itself. I’ll help you if need be...it will be fun to chat with you about this...so let’s connect on the phone at some point. Maybe we’ll even get to meet...my sister lives in North Carolina and I am planning to visit there on xmas. The problems I see in it are: With new paths should come new major arcana. Cool!...several things happening here along other lines as well...an allied lineage has produced a marvelous Tarot that I’ve commented on: CITATIZA-TET TAROT INTERPOLATED My friend Slobodan has also written another interesting document on Tarot (a real new Gnosis generator, which is why we admire the lineage). Liber Legis claimed the tarot was right except for Tzaddi. Does this contradict? How to number, or renumber the paths? This new scheme will completely destroy the ideas about the 'fall of man' and certain ideas about Da'ath -- and the whole upper end of the Tree will be cast in a different light. The Book claims that none will be lifted up or cast down. All is as it ever was. The 'fall of man idea' will dissolve. -wait- I say that, but I know people will not be able to let go. Old habits... I can give you a lot on this...I hope you’ll become interested in my translations of the Enochian Liber Loagaeth: THE FIRST LEAF (1A) Sorry, I just had to run this by JSK. -----Original Message----- From: Jake Stratton-Kent Sent: Wednesday, October 03, 2012 2:36 PM > Also, one of my A.'.A.'. students sent me the following e-mail message. I'm not a student of English QBL, but I can't believe that this is something new. Hasn't the question of the ampersand as a letter of the alphabet been raised before? yup. Don't know many words spelled with it though ;D As for 26 being 'some number' 19 to 7 is an important ratio in solunar calendars, and 26 pointed stars that produce the EQ order are pure geometry. Old School types like Pythagoras and John Dee would have appreciated that, but the average Crowleyite probationer doesn't, boo hoo. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"seriously, I quit as spokesman for EQ some years back. For for some reason - even though qabalah means tradition - its rare to find folks prepared to try an English gematria system they didn't invent themselves. The other approach is to ignore everything the originators said about their own system and use it for juvenile stuff instead. I'm not sure which is most presumptuous. So basically EQ is a system, you either use it or you don't, no claims for an 'only true way' were ever made by me. I just don't want to be the person fielding all the objections and examining umpteen alternative systems anymore. ALWays Jake ...some great info from Mr. Kent; his geometrical notes worth considering, as we strive to better improve our effort...and an interesting attitude from the inventor (so-called) of an EQ that has led towards a Hindu school of thought. I don't say that to denigrate his system; so much as what is Hindu stands behind much of what we call the Occult in the West. And there's an especial role for both Hindu and the Occult behind the American phenomenon. But I am I guess, also not surprised at his incredibly democratic-seeming condescension. What I mean is, by this democratic idea that everybody has to be equal in everything (a dumbass idea that's infused in European and American socio-political institutions), it's as if Mr. Kent was so sick of having to read everyone's equal approach (because of the retarded dictum: if it's good for you then it's good enough) and he'll just stick to his cool (to him) EQ--though I will agree that most of what's out there is quite worth the condescension that he exudes. But for AL to be meaningful and Thelema to be a coherent philosophical system, there must be only one solution to the order and value; it's a prophecy that may or may not be in the process of being solved by those of us whom are working on it...but we are approaching it with some credulity and with a qabalistic intelligence not displayed by most into Thelema. And despite the fact that I sincerely respect the work of JSK, it is a denomination of Thelema that is far more Eastern in its paradigm and seems only to validate the Holy Books (nore or less, really, just Liber AL as they really pay no attention to the rest of the philosophical system) for the sake of getting to its more esteemed Hindu concepts and Tantric symbols; ignoring Thelemic symbols--almost entirely. We have what Mr. Kent cannot appreciate nor could have any genuine interest in...in the elitist tone of his letter, like the tone of much of his work, he's beyond Thelema. Rather, I say, he's outside and should probably stick to his hinduized Nema-ism and Voudoun. And we'll note the misappropriated pop-particle physics with its time distortions and other elements that make fodder for untalented science fiction writers and short order cooks. I was hoping that he would elaborate on any research already done on the ampersand and his conclusions on whether it should be included/excluded from English QBL. I know I've spoken to him before on English QBL in general and he did have the same attitude. For whatever reason, he seems to want to distance himself from it. Perhaps, what it is today is something quite different than what he originally conceived and he's become weary of being at the center of some bastard child controversy. Perhaps more, as I really suspect, his system has become stagnant...it can no longer produce new Gnosis...it's no longer constructing the new mythos (the quest for the Grail into modern, shall we say, nomenclature)...and there's no one to renew that quest. A magickal lodge or lineage that does not produce new Gnosis is not a magickal lodge or lineage. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"As for 26 being 'some number' 19 to 7 is an important ratio in solunar calendars, and 26 pointed stars that produce the EQ order are pure geometry. Old School types like Pythagoras and John Dee would have appreciated that, but the average Crowleyite probationer doesn't, boo hoo. I will accept 'average Probationer'. That might even be giving me credit I don't deserve. I am certainly no John Dee or Pythagoras, but I still appreciate stars of various configurations and geometric purity levels. Maybe I was too harsh in what I said about 26. I think Mr. Kent must be who discovered the EQ with the 26 pointed star (ALWHS..)? I'm not exactly sure. I'm familiar with that system. It is very cunning and I still like how it was put together. I worked with that system for a few years on and off. It was very inspirational to me. I think Crowley set the tone for a twenty-seven based system with Liber Trigrammaton. I’m more critical of this idea that “19 to 7 is an important ration in solunar calendars”...how so?...and what solunar calendar?...I’ve never heard anything about this, and I really suspect this is something he either mis-remembers or mis-remembers on-purpose. The 26-pointed star with the magick number of 11 has never struck me as having any significance...what?...the number of letters in the alphabet mixed with the big magick number?...why?...this question was never answered. That Mr. Kent uses a geometric symbol (and a very unimportant one at that!) does not connect his ideas with Pythagoras or John Dee...maybe, had he considered a Tetractys or a more basic geometrical shape (cf. my work in the Greek Qabalah). Trying to assume sort pretense at arrogance as Mr. Kent refers to the “average Probationer” in the same thought with Pythagoras and Dee was more a manipulative statement on his part. Rather, your argument regarding Liber Trigrammaton is much more persuasive. I’m kinda saddened, but not so surprised that Mr. Kent made such a superficial statement overall...very defensive and arrogant on his part, and more an egoic projection. seriously, I quit as spokesman for EQ some years back.

The other approach is to ignore everything the originators said about their own system and use it for juvenile stuff instead. I'm not sure which is most presumptuous. I don't know how much of this is directed at me, if any, but I didn't invent anything. All I did was add something to an existing system that I thought it was missing. The system was in place, the numbering was in place, the Berashith method was already hashed out, and the scripture that calls for it's discovery has long been written. If I did anything I followed an established trail one step further. Results will prove or disprove. I've already tried two systems I didn't invent. I don't know what 'juvenile stuff' means in this context. Kabbalah can mean tradition and some other things, but the very act of creating an English Kabbalah goes against much tradition -- or maybe I should rather say there is not yet an established tradition in English gematria to go against. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I think that as Mr. Kent’s system; along with his dead magick has failed to continue to inspire the fire of spirit in him. And he deep-down realizes his Hindu ends brought him to nothing more than a bunch of Yantras. Besides, he’s more into his Goetic work today and working completely outside the Thelemic paradigm; yet, again. Per the ‘juvenile’ comment, JSK has watched a lot of people on these immature Thelema lists play with his EQ and he’s watched all their pettiness and the dumbass “juvenile stuff” that they called new Gnosis. They never acted in any cooperative manner, which for him was not to give him the adulation I think he felt he deserved for it. Nema got all the celebrity instead. What you did, Ed, to follow the tradition that has been started by those “few” of us that have been more honestly playing with it, has been a real Qabalah effort. The way the system of the Qabalah works, new Gnosis flows from the divine into any one of us (after all, we are all gods!) and then we must transmit that energy to those who are of “us.” A Qabalist doesn’t work exclusively alone; though much work is to be done alone...just being in an A.’.A.’. lineage is qabalistic work!...so many even in the A.’.A.’. that don’t understand this. So basically EQ is a system, you either use it or you don't, no claims for an 'only true way' were ever made by me. I just don't want to be the person fielding all the objections and examining umpteen alternative systems anymore. I could sympathize with that. translation: “I’m not interested in Thelema at all anymore...probably never really was...’cept that I got to hang out w/Grant and almost became a Thelema celebrity.” In JSK’s defense, I will say that his e-mail was directed to me personally, and I’m sure that if he knew we would be discussing it, he would have worded it much more diplomatically, and probably with a little more explanation. So take whatever is useful from his comments and disregard the rest. I really don't take anything personally. I think what he said speaks more about his frustrations with his system than my ideas or the gematria system that already existed in the Libri. I found it interesting that my grade of Probationer was used like an insult. I personally feel exalted to be a Probationer in this lineage that is doing important work. It's a matter of perspective. I take it as a cautionary tale about lust of result and attachment. Were he more of a gentleman I'd tell him how much his system inspired me and how much I enjoyed it -- because I really did! But he's not and I'm not going to dandle him in my arms and whisper sweet EQ correspondences in his ears to comfort him. As far as him being diplomatic to my face, no thanks -- I don't respect that kind of shit. I don't think he would have much of an explanation anyway. He says he's done with the EQ, yet he has time to crap all over anything that threatens it. His reaction proves that he doesn't care about finding the answer, yet is still too invested to let go.

You know, I've been noticing something. You go on these websites that Kent is on and there's a certain flavor of magickian there. Yeah, I know it's morbid and I have better things to do right now, but humor me for a second and I'll forget all about this whole thing. I followed a few links and I notice that all these people surrounding Kent have the same way of insulting everyone they can. Even their blurbs for their shitty books and lectures. They can't just say, \"this is who I am and this is what I'm about.\" No! It has to have back handed references to Crowley and Thelema in general and some stupid fantasy about how they have accomplished mastery of hoo doo and Enochian and they are some kind of Swiss Army knife of magickal potency. Note that for the most part, these authors are writing to 20+ year-old boys...that’s their principal demographic. These are boys becoming desperate for marriage and the high and holy blow-job. As the U.S. in general (even though Kent is in England, he markets to a primarily American audience) is a mostly illiterate audience (literally!...they can read labels and street signs, but that’s 99% of their reading), one has to dumb-down one’s material. This also brings ignorant forms of slander...the claim to fame being that one is better than ‘that other idiot.’ And since Americans don’t read anything that requires an education, in the field of Magick and even the larger field of spirituality, only beginner books are publishable...since those few who get to the next level aren’t a large enough audience to make advanced publishing profitable. So the same books get re-written over-and-over again...year-after-year (sigh). Okay, let me just show you something. \"This work has chiefly involved the promulgation and development of 'Engllish Qaballa' as a magical system, (not a way of wearing out calculator batteries proving Crowley's claims to messiah-hood).\" Of course, “promulgation” clearly implies that ‘the word’ is being spread to an audience, which is exactly what’s not happening...most people can’t figure out the Hebrew Qabalah; much less an English hybrid of any sort. But this is very typical promotional blurb...not that much different from selling cars by showing drivers playing field hockey on the cliff of a mountain. This is a blurb about him promoting a lecture he's inflicting on a dozen goths at a renaissance fair somewhere. What the fuck is that about? LOL What about promulgating the law of Thelema? Old hat. So Thelemites are wearing out calculator batteries trying to prove claims that Crowley didn't make. Most people are too wrapped up in themselves...these authors have to be incredibly self-promoting...they’re even competing w/Crowley.

And this sort of behavior has been going on since the mid-80s when the Caliphate won the lawsuit against Motta, which is also one of the main reasons why these lodges don’t house adults (people who’ve gotten over the pretense of going to nightclubs and actually have families with children and real jobs). Yet another one of these contacted me a couple of weeks ago...she wants to buy one of my books...but she needs to set up a lay-away.

Okay one more and I'm finished, but I hate to do this because I actually bought this guy's book, The Complete Magician's Tables Stephen Skinner. He's reduced to lecturing on another speaking event with Kent somewhere. This is about that book from his page: \"...in more than 800 Tables, four times as many tables as Aleister, Crowley's Liber 777, or any other imitator.\" He's wrote a book that's four times better than Crowley's. Nice. Then he implies that he is an imitator. At least he's honest. Rehash, rehash, rehash...I don’t think Skinner has ever had an original thought.

From: http://www.oocities.org/VVVVV93/ZEQ.html PJ, didn’t you know Marc Cohen/Joshua Zintel when you were working with Ray Eales in Florida?. Also, who is Frater 999? "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"VI. ENGLISH QABALAH OF 9 CHAMBERS (Please reference Table 1) You will have noticed that Da'ath - the \"invisible Sephirah\" - has thusfar been ignored. Frater 999 added the Ampersand (\"&\") to this system, as the 27th 'variable' to the 26 letter English Alphabet. He showed me a book detailing the history of the English Alphabet, which included the Ampersand with the 26 letters, giving historical validity to his inspiration: (ALPHABET: The History, Evolution, and Design of the Letters We Use Today; by Allen Haley; ISBN 0-8230-0170-9; c. 1995 e.v.) Utilizing the Ampersand as Da'ath makes sense, as Ampersand is not really a letter and Da'ath is not really a Sephirah. Indeed, even its shape (&) resembles the Great Serpent/Dragon itself. But moreover, this gives us 27 terms - the same number of versus with which it takes the Z.E.Q. to unfold the order & value, from Chapter I of Liber AL itself! Although the ampersand first appears in verse six (SIX= 718, cf. \"Abomination of Desolation\" referred to in AL), since it is not a letter proper, we reserve the right to put it at the end of the English Alphabet; as such, this 27th term will equal 900, allowing an English Qabalah of 9 Chambers. The use of a 27 (or 3 cubed) term Alphabet opens up many new possibilities, and shows the English Alphabet itself mimicking the dynamics of the interchange of 9/10 already discussed, giving us a 26/27 dynamic as well. Frater 999 has done much work with the Ampersand, and I mention his addition here chiefly to show the Qabalah of 9 Chambers that it allows. Those who feel uncomfortable with this exception to our Order & Value scheme may use 'H', which also represents Kether, being the 1st letter to appear in AL, as Da'ath - for H is also the first repeated letter in AL; or, the first duality, mimicking the first letter itself. Yet you will not have a Qabalah of 9 Chambers unless you utilize a 27th term, of which the Ampersand, which appears in The Book of the Law, is the historically most obvious choice. Thanks for this...I didn’t know that they went to the ampersand in their Z.E.Q. days. And yes, I knew both and had a big falling out w/both of them...Mark & I originally started the EQ idea w/Mark doing the original figuring on the order and value and my doing the ‘new symbols to attribute them to.’ Then we bought Joshua in and Mark and Joshua really got into both the assignment of Sephiroth and a whole range of decimal calculations. When I quit H.O.O.R., I tried to continue our collaboration, but they refused to talk to me anymore...then went around slandering me to a lot of people as a couple others in the order did four straight years of crank phone calls and threats.

H.O.O.R.’s website seems to be more a mini eCommerce site than a Magickal Order...and they’ve been kissing the Caliphate’s ass in the hopes of expanding their publishing interests. Damn, that's crazy. They figured it out, but why did they place the & at the end and not where it would fall in the Berashith method? That is an interesting question...it seems to me it should be in the order in which it appears, as per the other letters...or it is not a letter. This also goes to the problem I’ve seen with trying to attribute the letters to the Sefirot...there’s a reason why the letters aren’t a part of the Sefirot in the Hebrew QBL, why should it be any different w/the EQ. And if the EQ isn’t directly related to AL and/or the other Holy Books of Thelema, then how can it be a Qabalah?...What is the Hebrew QBL w/o the Torah? And it seems only natural that the next holy book of importance would be the next manuscript that comes closest to a Class A transmission...and that can only be Liber 418; a Class A-B document. The rest of the holy books are no higher than Class B. And here, we must look to Babalon and the Beast—the Goddess and her consort as the mythological characters in our epic mythos. And we must find in the Biblical references in AL (such as ‘abomination of desolation’) the proper connectors that show the evolution of an historical journey that connects the past w/the present and the future. These two got to a certain point and couldn’t go any further; though they had some moments of genius. I really believe that Marc and Joshua fell to their vanity when they decided to launch their highly energetic and sick campaign against me. They were obsessed w/me for years. I figured out why they deviated from the Berashith method and why it's faulty. It's faulty because Crowley spelled 'and' in I:3. He uses '&' in I:6. If the '&' should go at the end he would have continued to spell 'and' until after I:27. He doesn't. The reason why they are putting it at the end is because they do not believe it is a real letter due to its logogramic state. It is the closest thing we have to a hieroglyph and is the odd man out, but it's a letter all the same. Yes, I believe the issue really is; either it’s a letter or it isn’t...no matter the type of letter. This is the important decision and one that can’t be ignored or avoided, which is what I thought immediately, when I got your first email. That it is no longer considered a letter today also has its import. So it seemed then as it does now, that we let both lines run until we can see which answer plays out...or maybe even that both may be correct, which would be even more amazing. Though I gotta say, I like the idea of the ampersand a whole lot. It seems to have much to do with the direction to ‘change not so much as the style of a letter.’ "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Da'ath is also real. It represents knowledge; and because knowledge has, traditionally, been hidden, the sephiroth has been hidden also. I think that in this Aen knowledge can't be easily hidden. Every day knowledge is harder and harder to hide. Secrets are coming out and our private information is also harder to hide. Da'ath, also can no longer be hidden. I think this is of paramount importance and very perceptive of you to say this! Yes, I remember once, Marc and Joshua berating me because I touted knowledge; they were tying Da’ath in with Choronzon as evil and of the Black Lodge. I remember telling them they were idiots...knowledge is necessary to figure out how to tie your shoes...where would we draw the ‘evil’ line. At what point does one get to so much knowledge that he becomes evil. They were such jerks. If you want to see more of this style of thinking from Ray Eales—Mottants, read my ‘Defender of Eales’ article...David Stein does a whole other number; trying to make me look like a piece of shit for quitting Ray. They were all a part of a salacious cult that continues to this day. The reality of both of these things lies at the heart of the gematria and ToL I propose, but neither of these ideas has been accepted in the source page. They almost have it, but not quite. I want you to look at my Tree of Life diagram. I mapped the letters backwards the first time and was not impressed. I was trying to figure out whether it was any good and what might be the significance. When I realized my mistake I remapped them without much thought. When I got to looking at what I had I almost freaked. First a word, I did not manipulate this at all. I used the Berashith order and value that we established with the '&' included. I numbered the Sephira from 0 to 10 and included Da'ath, like I said. I combined the Jewish ARI and Christian Hermetic diagrams like I talked about. I mapped the paths by the traditional method -- in other words, 9 to 10 is the last path, 8 to 10 is the second to last, 8 to 9 is third last etc, etc, all the way up. Purely mechanical order with no artistic license. Here are two things I have noticed about it that I think are important: 1) Traditional path number 27 is '&' -- ampersand! LOL The blasted tower, the orgasm. 2) E I O and U are all connected to Da'ath on the newly added paths (new to our system, but not new to the ARI configuration). Why? because these four paths were missing completely in our Hermetic tree and these are all vowels that would not have existed in Hebrew. \"All these old letters of my Book are aright...\" I'm not going to comment any further -- I attached the file. I think this is brilliant...I had met someone some time back who added the same paths to the tree...but couldn’t convince me of anything as they were still working off the Hebrew for the paths...or maybe it was JSK’s EQ solution...I can’t remember for certain. With this, I not only like it, I think it all belongs back on the original document we were setting up...I’m going to prepare a draft copy for you to look at...you should have it shortly. An interesting note to add into this document... Noting that 69 (mentioned below, as one of the semiprimes who’s aliquote sum is 27; the other being 133, which means Gold and can here be referenced to the ‘golden path’ and suggesting Thelema as such) means Thelema in the EQ, we can consider that 69 is the number of orders and tractates in the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Hebrew Mishna. Now, the Mishna was the oral tradition that ultimately led to the formation of the Talmud. Noting that 69 is also the astrological sign of Cancer (turned on its side) and that Cancer is attributed to the Chariot Atu with its connection to 418/The Great Work is an added strong point. ...also, 27 is a ThRShRQ of 72; the Shemhamphorasch. Excellent. I'm glad you understand. It is hard to communicate something like this. It makes you feel alone. I want to propose a change in plan. As far as I'm concerned I have said what I want to say with the graphic. I have said more than I ever wanted to say! Use my original or have it duplicated in a better, cleaner version -- as you see fit. Add my Motto to a cover page and a title. Add a commentary of your own and sign it with your motto. You are far superior in your knowledge. I could only hinder people with my attempts at explanation. I don't even understand half of the ideas you have given me and probably won't for years. You have made this possible and I have been in the weird position to be able to see it. My mind is simple. I think about simple things. Besides, I would be honored. I think I want to title it Liber Revenge! Calculate it. The ampersand is a sideways view of the crown of Osiris. Osiris was cut into 14 pieces by Set. Set is the force of the black brothers. Osiris was destroyed by him just as Christianity was destroyed by Paul and Catholicism. Isis goes out to find the pieces and revive him with her magick, but returns with only 13. The 14th is his foreskin. In memory of this loss they placed the image of the foreskin on Osiris' head as a crown. Now that the practice of circumcision is winding down (as are the dumbass religions), the ampersand, the sign of physical love has returned to it's place (the Tower). We are Horus, we are taking revenge on these Setian cretins. Isis whored herself to Set to produce a child who would destroy him. The Hermetic knowledge mated with the Christist idiots of the Western tradition and finally children were born of a different stripe who would kill the influence of Set. Crowley and Nietzsche and were among the first and brightest. Liber Revenge! Mind blowing stuff, has anyone begun doing math with this revised system as of yet? It will be interesting to compare the quality of synchronicities with the system from Liber 805. The whole thing supports my main thesis in Liber 27, that the trigrams have a direct correspondence with the English alphabet in so far as forming an English Qabalah, and my previous observations connecting 27 and 108 as you quoted earlier. As you read the dialogue in the emails, you’ll see that Jake Stratton-Kent (creator of that other EQ) played with a real flimsy criticism of our EQ idea and then condescended to call Ed a “mere Probationer.” This also evoked much in the origin of 805 as connected to Marc and Joshua; my original partners in this enterprise and who then went on to develop what they called the Z.E.Q. (Z was the initial of Marc’s motto at the time—Zarathustra). Revenge = 222 in EQ; 222 is of course, Chokmah ... and the letters of Chokmah also equals 222 in EQ!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"27 = NO in EQ!!! (cf. Not) ... it’s also the number of verses in AL that it takes for all the letters to appear! ... and also, the word ‘hidden,’ which seems a reference to the riddles of AL—all these things being hidden for us to find. Yet a curious thing about the number 26 is its connection to the middle pillar and the shushuma, since there are 26 vertebrae in the human spine. Of course the Crown would make the 27th! All this has been discussed in my little book on EQ titled 'Liber 27'. I'm curious to use the new system to see what it gives us regarding our magickal formula such as Babalon Chaos etc... I think overall, there’s two strains that need to be followed...the original of 26 letters and the new possibilities of 27 letters and the re-design of the Tree...shown now, on the link I sent to the list. It may be that we have a much stronger view of the nature of knowledge/gnosis & intelligence in the modern, post-Internet world and that the extra paths from and through Da’ath, as well as the re-numeration of the Sefirot needs to be examined. The A.’.A.’. as a living Qabalah, is built on the old way and maybe the new Tree is still ahead of our time...maybe not (you can take the pun there as well...lol). What we do know is that we must remain open to what may be just ahead of us in the evolution of Occult Gnosis...or is it being sent by the Secret Chiefs and proscribed for now? That this ties in w/80-The Tower of Prophecy, we certainly need to do a good bit of ruminating on this. You have done well in writing the comment and I am glad I left this to you. You have spearheaded this whole thing for so long. When I first wrote you I feared sounding presumptuous speaking to the Order Head at the grade of 0=0 about such a thing. Now I feel presumptuous in claiming this thing to be mine, even in part. The Book of the Law would not have predicted it were it my invention. I think that a lot of shit is going to get thrown in the monkey cage at the zoo soon. I am not going to defend what we have done in any way. 222 will stand on its own. I think that a lot of people will crush themselves against this monument. PS 2x7=14, the pieces of Osiris 2+7 is “nine,” which equals 27 in EQ. It keeps getting deeper. I have found justification for my Da'ath theory 52. There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter. The modest woman is Binah. Her veil is Da'ath. Saturn belongs to Da'ath making it the veil of sorrow and pall of death. Tear down the veil, as we have done declaring Da'ath a real sephiroth. It is a lying specter of the centuries, meaning the tradition regarding Da'ath has been false. I think it's interesting that I said something about this and you find at least two or three more things to tie into that. I wasn't aware of half of the things that are now in the document. A slight criticism: It seems that the document is all preface and introduction -- which I think are both great. The image is present, but I think the reader might eventually ask, \"What is the Liber itself?\" not realizing. I suppose that is fine, leaving them hanging, looking for something that is right in front of their face, like what we were doing looking for the alphabet. Perhaps it is best that way, re-thinking it. I really think that last thing about Mary torn on wheels really elevates the perception of the verse from the black metal angst of the teenager, to an actual and useful commentary upon Kabbalistic theory of the highest order. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Actually, I’m a bit surprised that you say the move from Introduction to the document is unclear...there’s two clear sections to the main document: 222/Chokmah and 201=Vengeance...four sections in all; Preface, Introduction, 222, 201 & Epilogue. Every writing effort is a learning experience...I think I can also echo your statement...I wasn’t aware of half the things that are now in the document. ;-) The technical approach to Qabalah is as important as other methods, approaches and practices. And the march to Knowledge is vital; something I’ve known for a long time, as I’ve always known that Raja-Yoga is one of the approaches to enlightenment. That the new paths on the tree elucidate this is quite important. Next time we talk, ask me about this and Rosicrucian vision...as a matter of fact, I’ll call you in a few...I have a little time before I have to run out. You know, these video games that everyone is obsessed with. I'll tell you what good comes out of them. They get people used to the idea of controlling a person who is not actually them. It is like they incarnate in the alternate lower world. It's them but it isn't them. Using the reverse of this reasoning, you can more easily comprehend and accept that maybe the physical body is like this with a greater being or consciousness controlling us in this physical realm. Incarnation is a game like that in a way. It gets the masses more ready to accept a Hermetic idea about life. What I don’t like about this is both the obvious allusion to PKD and the nihilist philosophical position that there’s a better world than this one; somewhere else and not in this life. I'm glad you don't mince words. Not sure what PKD is and my idea on nihilism is different than looking for a world beyond. I thought nihilism is more to do with there not being anything beyond. Perhaps I was stretching this 'video' idea. I do, however, think there is a more permanent and powerful aspect of myself, and everyone else, not apparent in the physical incarnation. I agree with you that there is “some more power aspect” of the self; the Autoeides or Holy Guardian Angel...and PKD (Phillip K. Dick) was a cool author (B5 being my favorite Sci-Fi of all time), but his Gnosticism was about hating this world. People who get stuck in thinking the body is all there is aren't going to cross they abyss of death for fear. They are going to turn into black brothers and cling to the precipice of Da'ath. Cling to everything and build a snail's shell to protect them. Dissolution is all. Though I think yes, there’s still the idea of an over-identification with the physical body, that obviously must undergo change and die. However, the body as it is in this moment, interacts with spirit and is the vessel that hold joy. And as much as the body presents its own situation relative to soul and spirit...so the congealed soul must also ultimately be abandoned to move even deeper. The Universe emerges outwards from the godhead within. It is a strange riddle that we should cross the veil of death and not physically die. Were this the case there could be no incarnate Magister Templi. How can one claim to have crossed it and live? I’d like to be able to say that I’ll let you know when it happens....lol. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"IAO is all vowels and no consonants. He is all force and no modulation! The movement of the mouth in this pronunciation is opening - opening - opening, then closing and waning back to nothing. It is like a wave growing and receding. The power is there. Consonants modulate and direct the force. They make sense of the expression. Reason is flawed. Above reason is pure force, perhaps. Force looking for expression. IAO reformed to OIA produces a path from Chesed to Kether through Da'ath and Binah. I'm not sure if this is significant. Certainly it is...IAO/OAI is the nature of the movement of the involutionary and evolutionary processes—but they belong to another Qabalah. If you are looking for holy names in the EQ, you’d have to look to the EQ or find truly amazing synchronicities. I agree and that's a good point. The problem is there are few English holy names. Even Liber Al uses Egyptian names. Perhaps Liber Al is setting the precedent to absorb the Egyptian pantheon. I used IAO because of its connection with the Star Ruby. IAO is the Gnostic name for God...much on this in my work on the Greek Qabalah. What do you think about this 27 club? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club I came across this when I was doing some research off the original links you sent me...not too impressed by this. Nor am I, but the thing seems to be outside the realm of pure chance. Not really, for every young star that died at 27, I can show you 26, 22, 33, etc. This is the usual propagandistic exclusion of some facts to enhance others. It would seem to me that Da'ath is no longer a hurdle to be leaped across. The old magickians were trying to leap from 4 to 3, crossing Da'ath. Now we have a Kabbalah that says that Da'ath is 3! and is death and hate and a flawed knowledge. The knowledge is great below Da'ath but is blind above. Perhaps it is so frightening because this is the point where everything you worked for disintegrates. How do we contemplate without knowledge? The sound of one hand clapping, perhaps. What guides us then? Pure delight -- joy? I think there is a certain weariness at the ends of knowledge that produces a natural nihilism and moral decadence. One chooses to avoid a certain, maturing discomfort with a myopic vision that brings an over-concern for one’s immediate comfort, which is the maintenance of the congealed soul and vital ego. So I don’t know that it’s a leap nor that it has ever been a leap at that point. Moreover, it’s really the point at which one traverses the path from Chokmah to Kether (where the Fool Atu is placed) that has been traditionally where this leap has been said to be; moving to the mystery of Kether: Not self is self. \"Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you! \" The inclusion of the word 'wheels' is the key that confirms we are talking about Sephirah! You have done well to perceive this verse in connection with the verse I spoke about: "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\"There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter. \" I think these verses speak also about nuns and the burka and Victorian swimwear and modesty in the name of holiness. This is a mundane interpretation of the veil of Da'ath, but if all women are chaste and modest, they deny themselves and men the experience. Is Nuit saying that she is Binah, but not correctly perceived? This other verse speaks further: I think Nuit is as Reguli asserts; the daughter of Babalon, who is herself, the desire of the godhead to know itself. Babalon then births the field of play in which the godhead will act as a woman provides the garden in which you wills sew your seed. And every sexual act is procreative; that people should know what phantasmagoric things they are creating so much of the time. It’s almost a wonder that we continue to evolve as a race. However, when the chaste woman acts, she is manipulative as a witch and acts with volition but without love. In other words, her legs may be open, but her heart shut. Any child born of this union is an abomination—without divine presence...and the psychopaths and narcissists become more and more prevalent in our society. It could be argued that she is the one manipulated. Manipulated to believe she is a filthy creature who should not express sexuality except to hook a husband or manipulate men. A woman's real sexuality must remain in secret. I certainly don't view women as innocent victims. When i was a child I, too, was manipulated with a sin and guilt complex. When I emerged from this programming I realized how much I had lost my life to an idea that was false. I had wasted so much of my time in the name of a God who never was. It was both liberating and a slap in the face. In order to leave that mentality you have to admit you had been played for a fool. Women are, I think, more prone to social manipulation, especially when it comes to sexuality. The words whore and slut don't apply to men very well -- we are players or lady's men. It's a lot more complementary. This incomplete view of the self is promulgated by veiling the vices in virtuous words. You are right to say that our world is filled with incomplete people -- monsters. All these social problems in a Christist culture are one thing...but my point was that Babalon is of the nature of the godhead itself...and not merely some archetypal slut. That we attach the words, whore and harlot to her is more a symbolic expression that is more complicated than the oversimplified sexual mores of the Christists. I recommend you check my articles out on Babalon and the Beast. As well, Cammy on our eGroup will be turning out something interesting in the near future. \"I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness.

Such are men like DuQuette and all the Caliphate that have appeared over the last few decades...and the A.’.A.’. lineages that find round-a-bout ways to get money from their students...and the creative ones that hold back their prophecy and experience until coin is rendered...all shut ups (cf. Book of Lies, cap. 89 and our Liber 89). You are correct. They want to play. Magick is a Disney resort to these people. You go there on the weekend or when your OTO buddies are over. I never thought about this in terms of magickians as the soldiers. There is plenty of literature that describes the mystic as warrior...Star Wars being a modernized example and Castaneda, another. And as we spoke on the phone, we are taught in this literature that we have only one true enemy, ourselves. That the Caliphate has made a game of this for their young membership to be exploited is all about money and publishing power...they’ve traded spirituality for this...these perfect nihilists and narcissists. But then why should anyone be surprised...they didn’t look to the A.’.A.’. for spiritual authority, but rather, mocked Our Order and betrayed Our secrets, as they looked to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for their authority...secular, governmental authority.

Sometimes, sometimes they are the many different emotions involved in love-making as Grant has well detailed...sometimes they are the nature of one’s working morale. I had never thought about strange drugs in connection with the emotions and the natural chemicals produced by the body. This is interesting. I don't know why I hadn't seen this before. Grant writes about the 28 different lubricants in the vagina for the 28 days in her cycle...I found this fascinating when I first encountered it myself. I have your mailer all prepared and should get it in the mail to you tomorrow. A lifetime of experience in a single night. I said before that they want to cross the abyss before they have fucked. The want to die before they have lived. Luna is the small death, sex. They want the big death, Saturn, before the little death. What is the whole point of anything if not experience? The Christist egregore is one of pain...the Buddhist assertion that desire (Babalon) is the source of sorrow and hence, life itself is sorrow. And so why continue through to experience in this paradigm? Only if life is pure joy is such a goal as experience worth the effort. Desire is the source of pain because lust of results ruins the act of obtaining desire. They want to shoot their wad as fast as possible and get to heaven with Jesus and Grandma. This is why 'born again' is so popular. This lie tells them to say a magic prayer and they can avoid having to change their behavior and shoot straight to Jesus at death. Chaos can't intrude upon a sure thing like that. The game does not have to be played in Christianity or Buddhism. Their game is avoiding the real game? This is lust of result taken to it's natural conclusion. It's like the DuQuette ritual video. He wants to shoot straight to the conclusion and skip the ritual. The point of the ritual is the ritual. He wants to evoke 72 demons in 72 hours. I think it would be better to evoke a single demon correctly in 72 years. I have a new idea for the Tower. I can envision an eastern style tower like those of the Taj. Instead of the traumatic circumcision, it should be displayed as a symbol of power! It should no longer be blasted or shown with the mouth. I think the mouth is when the Rabbi sucks the bloody penis. What is going on"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"with that anyhow? It should be restored to a tower of Babalon that succeeds in reaching heaven, not a blasted tower that fails. Eternal joy, not limited orgasm. Confusion of our language is at an end with Liber 222. The symbol of the mouth is very important as the Tower is the mark of prophecy. And don’t forget the curse of the Magus (Grade of Chokmah 222); his truth being found as lies. Liber 222 is but the continuation of a journey started w/805 and moving through 27. 222 is excellent work, but closer to the beginning of yet, a much longer journey. It is very clear to me now. The tower is not only the penis but the destroyed libraries of Alexandria and of John Dee and of book and record burnings and the murder of those who know too much. These may not have been physical towers, but were intellectual towers. Yes! A part of the work of the Philosophus is through knowledge, to connect the past with the present as one begins to learn to take control of one’s destiny. It is the tower of Babel (Babalon -- \" the desire of the godhead to know itself.\"). It penetrates the night sky of Nuit. It is eternally growing in stature with each year. If a mouth is present in the image it is the mouth that makes the penis erect. It is no longer the fire breathing destroyer of the Book of Thoth. It is the circumcision of the tongue and not of the penis. It speaks clearly and unites the languages. It is educated speech. It is the education of the Trivium: grammar, logic and rhetoric. This is also what has been lost: the foreskin and the education. This is why the foreskin was on the head of Osiris. He lost part of his penis and part of his mind. So the tower represents consciousness comprehending itself...discovering truth...speaking prophetic words. Yes. I am beginning to think it may be the Tree and Kabbalah itself. Language is confounded, this was the 'steps' leading upwards -- letters. Jacob’s ladder is a great qabalistic story. The blind God wants to destroy the tower and send us scattered in ignorance, but we are stronger. It is us who will strike in this Aeon. Instead of the blasted tower, perhaps it is the tower that blasts against the forces of darkness. It is still the orgasm, but on the terms of Love and not hate. The orgasm freed from lust of results. The black brothers fuck to reproduce themselves and continue their hateful breed. For us it is joy. It is experience. It is a tower of knowledge that contains the force that might one day penetrate past knowledge -- past itself -- into the Triad where reason fails. Instead of God destroying us with the thunder of fear, we destroy this false God with the sword of education. This sword is the proud and learned tongue. I have said that the lecture magickians, cultists, and caliphate will crush themselves against the monument of 222. This is a vision of that obelisk inside the Tarot. It is the \"Knowledge & Delight\" unified of Liber Al. Our light will always burn in the darkness...but we are the few and will continue to be such for a long time. The world is still a place of ignorance and dark minds; closer to the N.O.X. as we are children of the L.V.X. The is the proverbial Black School of Magick that we distinguish ourselves from...different from the Black Lodge, yet both feed on human ignorance. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The monument is the righted QBL of Liber Al. 222, 805, 27 are the keys. That is more clear to me now. It is Kabbalah itself. They will not crush themselves against 222 (I was too concentrated on 222), although they will slander it and throw tantrums. It is the revelations of Liber Al that will destroy. Al is the prophecy of the mouth -- the tower is an aspect of it's Truth (Kabbalah). English QBL is the sorting out of the language that was confounded. English has not been confounded in any way; it has evolved like any other language. Don’t get hung up on the Tower of Babel story...it’s a slave story of God’s vengeance against those who would declare the divinity of man. Well, here we are again, building out tower...because the slave god’s an asshole. I don't mean to say that English was confounded in the myth (or that this was an actual event) but language itself was confounded through some sort of mechanism. Even were this story literally true, I realize English would not have been generated in that age. I am laboring under the idea that English will be the modern universal language, just as Latin was, and this mythical once-unified language of the Bible. I reference this story because I think we are in a similar place today, building a tower to reach the heaven of the Supernal Triad. The reason I like these stories is because of what is implied. Even when I was a child and this was inflicted on me I realized there would be no smiting of the tower were a real threat not implied. The whole book of Genesis is a story of the desert God retreating from the power of man. The garden of Eden's main plot device was God ass-covering and the prevention of man's usage of the Tree of Life -- half the battle had already been lost under the Serpent's influence while God was out 'getting his hair did'. In the time of Enoch, it was said that he walked with God. What this means is that in our pre-Cambrian state, we ‘thought’ with a different mind; that mind that today we call the cerebellum—the part of the brain that dreams and also handles our instinctual awareness. This is a pre-language (sotospeak) mind of symbols and basic urges. Eventually, that language was ‘confounded’ as we moved our consciousness to the cerebrum and the front of our brain structure. And here, the old symbolism became more a memory—when the dreaming began and trance & prayer became necessary to ‘walk with God.’..and also, language began. Has English not been confounded? I think perhaps it has if you look at the modern speech and the lack of knowledge about the ampersand. The Trivium was once the language art, now it's a metal band. A futuristic take on this theme is expressed wonderfully in the movie 'Idiocracy'. But of course, there are yet several letters to consider that also are no longer in the language. One I found immediately in the research that was connected with the ‘th’ sound and the letter ‘y’ (giving us ‘ye olde store’); another combines the ae into one letter. You have had an amazing qabalistic experience and one where I suspect the Secret Chiefs spoke through you. But no truth is absolute as is no one person. Keep the ‘Aha!’ as a L.V.X. within and let it transform every cell in your body. Here is an example from Merriam-Webster: \"Definition of BLING-BLING : flashy jewelry worn especially as an indication of wealth; broadly : expensive and ostentatious possessions"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Next Word in the Dictionary: blinger\" From Dictionary.com: dis·crim·i·na·tion noun 1. an act or instance of discriminating. 2. treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit: racial and religious intolerance and discrimination. 3. the power of making fine distinctions; discriminating judgment: She chose the colors with great discrimination. 4. Archaic . something that serves to differentiate. How is it that the word for one of the most powerful functions of a logical mind is confused with the idea of bigotry? Sometimes, there are really funny synchronicities and I don’t pretend to understand that I have any idea of how the term ‘bling-bling’ came to be. But it is interesting to me see that though ‘blinger’ is an act of discriminating...that part of such behavior would be to wear something that separates one from others. The wearing of bling-bling says to others, “I’m rich and you’re not” – as much as it says: “I’m black and you’re not.” And so I don’t see that the apple has really fallen that far from the tree. To make matters worse the improper bigotry definition (2) appears ahead of the real meaning of the word (3 & 4). This confusion is not present in the older Webster's Dictionary I inherited from my grandparents. I think that a confounding of language is simply a tactic of some sort of ignorance force that is still very much in play. The destruction of knowledge is a recurring theme. I understand where you're coming from, but I have to disagree on this point. It can be a tactic of an ignorant force of language in much the same way that ebonics was once trying to establish itself. But it can also be the sign of a living language that takes in new words and goes through the inevitable process of change (in contrast with dead languages like Latin). 'per se &' = 600 = 'Chokmah' ...great stuff here! But if the tower were to be the House of God, why would he strike it down? In Liber 222, I was working towards the idea of perhaps the Supernals to be that “holier place” and hence, the House of God; a place of ‘vengeance’ over the lowly who cannot attain to this place. What I like about this is ... well, being a smart guy (and sometimes, a smartass...lol) and say at least a guy who’s achieved a little bit of ‘awake-ness’ in this sleepwalking and dumbed-down world, I have to live within a tyranny of ignorance that I can’t escape in this life. I have to put up with the lack of spirituality in this world and in my neighborhood; sometimes, this even being dangerous for me (as the 50 Ways experience testifies!). I like that there is sanctuary and vengeance in the Supernals; that place where I can dwell with dignity and piss on those that have devoted their sleepingly miserable lives to pissing on me for choosing not to join the herd-mindset."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" \"57.

In the schematic that you set up, &=400 and in 805/EQ, 400 is equivalent to: ‘Union with the Many’ & ‘the slaves shall serve.’ By way of the Hebrew, 400 is the letter Tav—the cross of light.

The spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit is raised to [vengeance in the Supernals]—that vengeance being one’s transcendence and the leaving of the sleepers as if dead to bury the dead in the underworld. \"Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the Law of the Battle of Conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house.\" The secret house is the House of God, Tower. I have to admit, I do like this idea; something resonating, though I can’t rationalize it well. Because it's true, isn't it? The secret house is the ampersand, the House of God, the Tower. The worship is about the Tower because the magickian stands on the path of the Tower (#27) and invokes the Sephira in his body during Star Ruby. I especially like this now; considering the qabalistic story you told me of the 23rd letter and Adam’s ability to create. Especially the cubical nature of 27.

"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I think I'm on to something here. House of God - Temple of God? Yes, I think we have a way of looking at the Tower Atu as the creative conductor that channels the Logos into manifestation. As the mouth, it speaks prophecy; that is the words of manifestation and dharma...not prediction of the future, but manifestation of the present and the infinity that that holds for us. When I was first learning the Tarot; back in the late 70s/early 80s ev, I lived near the George Washington Bridge (at the top of Manhattan) in NJ. There was an African clan leader teaching the cards at the Magickal Childe (a famous shop you may have heard about) and who lived in the apartment complex over the bridge Port Authority. I had a profound experience with my first serious study of the cards...with the Hierophant Atu (from which the letter ‘H’ became an important letter—as shown in several of my writings)...the card told me that in using the Tarot, I was “invoking” and went on to describe invoking as a process of manifesting what I visualize. In the letter ‘H,’ I’ve visualized holiness and the profundity that accompanies it and my magickal career began, as a natural evolution of all that I had studied in spirituality since my childhood. It was the most profound vision I had had for quite a few years to come; until an important Neophyte vision—another story for another time. The Holier place in the Tower is ‘on fire’—the fierce fire of spirit that in its material expression rages with a vengeance. And note well that Liber AL, though very symbolic and with great spiritual import, is also a manual on material existence and here the fire burns literally in war and with that old curse: ‘may you live in interesting times.’ The Tower is the alchemical furnace (cf. Art Atu) and it is the ‘burning bush’ at the top of a mountain; a very particular human archetype—the holiness of the Tarot being that it presents a collection of images from that pre-Cambrian state when the gods dwelt amongst us and we could speak their language. I strongly recommend that you read Julian Jaynes: The Origins of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bi-cameral Mind. And then acquaint yourself with the workings of the Merkabah tradition. You will come much closer to the deeper importance of Thelema and its ancient Gnostic heritage. The Kabbalah is invoked in him during the Kabbalistic cross. The Khabs (Kabbalah) is in the Khu. Khabs is supposed to be a star, but isn't the Tree of life a star system? We are not in a Sephiroth, they are in us. ...this is the nature of the hologram. I have said that the tower is a library. A magickian is also a library. ...an archetypal library. A magickian is also a phallic power symbol. A magickian is also struck down by the world, if at all possible. A magickian has programmed his being with the ladder of Kabbalah. A magickian tries to reach God through her spiritual stature. A magickian may appear fallen. She may fall in actuality as if from a great spiritual height. I don't know if I spoke about everythng I wanted to. I got lost in all of this growing conversation. It appears that Ann was a bit concerned about us plotting revenge, LOL. I could say further that the House of God is the magickian's vehicle and Hadit.

The Tower is the House of God -- \"Le Maison Dieu\". It is a reference to an older tarot. Why he would strike it down? God is always cutting off his nose to spite his face according to the Old Testament. Maybe the problem is God refers to the Demiurge sometimes and IAO other times. Maybe the Demiurge strikes down the followers of the true Hermeticism whenever possible or maybe people just weren't ready for this or the Aeon was wrong. Could be a warning against falling to the black brotherhood. Maybe has something to do with the penis growing flaccid after orgasm. The last association was certainly appropriate...as well, as people are falling from the tower, they are incarnating and the tower is the archetypal production factory; Da’ath! Note also the fire of spirit above and the vengeance of a fire n a burning structure!!!

The tower of English Kabbalah will grow with each year -- more will be added to it all the time. The revenge is not just that of Liber 222 against pathetic magickians, but revenge for the destruction of the tower and confounding of language, revenge for Osiris. More rightly spoken it is the revenge of Horus and of Liber Al. The Vengeance is on a lot of different levels. AL:I.36 “My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khu-it.” AL:III.3 \"Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them.\" Liber Al is going to cull the weak from the strong. The revelations we are discovering will be the vehicle for that. Liber Al will be exposed, just as Da'ath is exposed, just as magickians will be exposed -- Christists of all stripes. What hides beneath those robes? The exposure will flatter some and humiliate others. I was hasty in what I wrote last night because I felt like I had to get it down or loose it. I don't pretend that Liber Al and 805, 27 or 222 will make Oprah's book club anytime soon, but things will change. We will probably be ignored for as long as possible. Denial.

Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.\"  I think these verses attack the same problems from the mundane as well as intellectual, Kabbalistic level. Note the 'Knowledge & Delight' phrase! Knowledge and delight should be tied together. Further confirmation that perhaps Da'ath is death to the ignorant, but bliss and delight through experience -- delight is the way forwards, both in sex and death. Knowledge is made true through experience? Without that experience knowledge is \"that lying spectre\". It is a farce and the hate of the lecture magickians and cultists for those among us who are relevant. Hate is their curse. They are diametrically opposed to the Book of the Law which proclaims love. They are ghosts, corpses that walk. The life energy has left them. They are liars! 19 to 7 ratio indeed! John Dee and Pythagoras were not among these sissies! Fuck them! Well said! Every move that we make with this will be a threat to them. Liber 222 will be vengeance and revenge! It is no wonder Liber Al was written as it was -- full of blood and fire. \"Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man, unto thee.\" Is this not saying then, thou shalt long for knowledge of Gnosis, which is then forbidden...in other words, all can’t be known and one can’t know all...as in Liber LXV when the swan asks: “But why sleekest thou the knowledge of their equivalence?” But yes, every step we take into Gnosis threatens the sleepers. Saturn again. The mystery of Da'ath is forbidden by Sepher Yetzirah 1:4 \"Ten and not nine, ten and not eleven etc.\" We, as magickians, long to cross the abyss and become Ipsissimus. Knowledge has always been linked with sex and death. To KNOW a woman, as the Bible would say. The Tree of Knowledge brought death to the man and woman in Genesis -- not really, but eventually they died. LOL Demiurgos didn't say instant death! Still, it was forbidden. And as the Gnostic gospels state, those with Gnosis shall not taste death. Now I feel very uncomfortable that I shared the JSK e-mail. As I said to Ed earlier, take what is useful out of his criticism and discard the rest. This talk of revenge is counterproductive – it brings in a completely unnecessary negative vibe to the whole project. I think in some of the follow-up conversations that have been held between just Ed and I, and what you actually find in the document itself is that the place of ‘vengeance’ is that ‘holier place’ that RHK, the ‘lord of vengeance’ goes to, which is then found to be the supernals and the abode of the truly righteous; the Gnostic Saints. AL III.3: \"Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance.

For some reason which I have not been able to trace, this God became ALASTOR, the Desert Daemon of the Rabbins, the later the \"Spirit of Solitude\" of Shelly.

It seems as thou this \"god of War and of Vengeance\" is then merely one who shall cause men to do their won Wills by Going as Gods do, instead of trying to check the irresistible course of Nature.) AL III.47: \"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine.

And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.\" From the Old Comment: These mysteries are inscrutable to me, as stated in the text. I note that the letters of the Book are the letters of the Book of Enoch; and are stars, or totems of stars. (See 15th Aire in Liber 418). From the New Comment: \"one cometh after him:\" 'one,' i.e. Achad. See Appendix{Appendix not yet recovered} for this and other points of this most 'evidential' verse. \"the Key of it all:\" all, i.e. AL 31 the Key! See MS for allusion to the \"line drawn\" and the \"circle squared in its failure.\" The attribution (in the Old Comment) of the letters to those of the Book of Enoch is unsupported. From Motta’s Comment: The injunction that AL be always translated along with a facsimile of the original is important, since no translation, no matter how good, can maintain all the keys, subtle double-meanings, and qabalistic puns of the original. If a student hopes to accomplish much, he will be forced to learn the English language very thoroughly. This suggests that English may in future centuries achieve the distinction of a hieratic language. AL III.48: \"Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I want to go on to the holier place.\" ...and again, this ‘holier place’ being the Supernals; or even the firmament of stars.

You’re trying to use intellect to explain your emotional reactions to both JSK and Marc/Joshua. I think there was some vitriol for Ed...for me, it was more a memory as a synchronicity. My personal vengeance re: Eales & Co., is my success...and I have carefully lulled Ed away from his eGroup attitude. Personally, I do not need to triumph over JSK either...but I am competitive (typical male: at least here) and do think that I am championing something more profound than JSK has produced. But that’s really neither here nor there...sotospeak. And Ed has naturally joined onto the competitive, male notion. And Ed is still championing himself against the external enemy...he will eventually find the real enemy is within. Ah....Probationers. It’s funny but I actually felt a physical reaction to the perceived attacks, and it was not pleasant. I try to teach my Probationers something that you actually taught me – to separate emotions from logic, not to bring in an emotional reaction where it is not necessary.

And I think he thought that I was still living in that time. Further, he has identified himself a bit with the idea he’s generated; but I think he’s pulling off that affectation. He really seems a very intelligent guy. But take it from another intelligent guy...that don’t mean we don’t step in doggy doo-doo every now and again.  I'm glad you shared the email. It was something that needed to happen. I'm in a very positive place. I think it was important because it showed me some things about the nature of the occult community in general. Nothing about me is ever truly personal. To say this is about Kent is to give him a lot of credit. He was a little bit of sand in my oyster. I understand why it would appear differently, though. It's kind of funny that you come back after all that has transpired. It must look like someone left the gas on or slipped something in our drinks. In the time of Enoch, it was said that he walked with God. What this means is that in our pre-Cambrian state, we ‘thought’ with a different mind; that mind that today we call the cerebellum—the part of the brain that dreams and also handles our instinctual awareness. This is a pre-language (sotospeak) mind of symbols and basic urges. Eventually, that language was ‘confounded’ as we moved our consciousness to the cerebrum and the front of our brain structure. And here, the old symbolism became more a memory—when the dreaming began and trance & prayer became necessary to ‘walk with God.’..and also, language began. I read a Kabbalistic legend that Adam was capable of creating through speech, just as God did. The 23rd letter of the Hebrew alphabet, according to legend, was removed from him to make his tongue impotent, just as a letter was removed from us. This is the basis for the number 23 craze of the nineties. I, personally, don't believe in evolution. I think it is a dogma. I don't believe in the Bible either, except on a mythical level -- and even that from the opposite perspective of where I am. There are a lot of things out there echoing this language problem. An interesting story with this 23rd letter...that Adam could be capable of creating through speech shows him to be the archetypal hologram or template for the human race. This works very well with what I’ve been pulling out of Loagaeth and other Gnostic literature. But of course, there are yet several letters to consider that also are no longer in the language. One I found immediately in the research that was connected with the ‘th’ sound and the letter ‘y’ (giving us ‘ye olde store’); another combines the ae into one letter.

It failed on several levels, mainly that it is nowhere seen in Liber Al. To be honest, Paul, the first time I heard someone say the ampersand was a letter I thought they were over the deep end. I had regarded it as no more of a letter than an exclamation point. It is still a real letter, the last hieroglyph, and mainstream sources have proven it beyond a doubt. All argument counter to it is instantly outside the realm of documented fact. It can be a tactic of an ignorant force of language in much the same way that ebonics was once trying to establish itself.

Are you saying that Bling-Bling is a word the English language was missing? I don't mean to sound overly traditional, but I think civilization could move forward faster were it unencumbered by such baggage. I’m not saying anything more than the fact that it’s slang that morphs contemporary languages into future languages...at least slang is included in a much larger evolutionary and cultural process that marks itself into quantifiable units of time. A side note about Ebonics, it failed because they discovered it was a Germanic language (sub-language?). It is a fact that English speakers will create Germanic sub-languages, if they are of a mind to differentiate their speech.. The brain creates what it is used to. Of course...and English and German evolved from the same ancient non-Aryan (ironically), Nordic language. It no longer had anything to do with Africa or white guilt, so the shepherds of the black victim community couldn't make hay off it anymore and buried this idiocy as quickly as possible. Sometimes, social engineers just go too far...ebonics being a perfect example of such. It had nothing to do with African or English tongue; except that it took uneducated ghetto slang and tried to make itself a tool of greater communication between educators and the hood. This had more to do with the politically correct movement and the crisis of evaluating cultural groups that aren’t born into the Amero-European and English-speaking culture. Great cultures of the past created great languages. Liber Legis advocates a separation between kings and slaves. This is probably a good idea. Liber AL does not advocate the ‘separation’ between kings and slaves; it merely says that the slaves shall serve...but so shall the kings! Some shall serve in servitude and others in servantry. The fact that other cultures aren’t born into our hybrid-English culture & its Puritan mythos doesn’t make them lesser...the only thing that distinguishes the king from the slave is consciousness.

If there were 23 letters, that means our Hermetic tree would have been complete for Hebrew with the insertion of Da'ath, thus making 23 paths.

There’s no such thing as coincidence; though we should be careful not to consider every event as an omen. Rather than type-casting energy...more a ‘Because’ function, going with the energy found in a qabalistic pursuit that engages ‘energized enthusiasm’ leads us right to that ‘Aha!’ experience and we have new Gnosis or we that much more, ‘become.’ And there are all the many forms of this elemental energy, as well delineated by the personalities of the Court Cards.

How does one make oneself ‘asar un nefer’? Did you know that 'coward and cower' have the same sum? The thing and the act are the same I suppose. I have uncovered so much strangeness with the Gematria calculator it is blowing my brain. Remember how I said the 13 peices of Osiris should be restored to 14 with the finding of the &? \"Phoenix 393\" = 1314. 'House of God' = 'letters' = 178. I updated the correspondences section of the page and attached it. Enjoy. I was glad to receive your letter today. I am much obliged. A discovery: \"41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed! Accursed be it to the aeons! Hell.\" Wife = 222. Refuse not thy Revenge, if she will! something to think about. So if we consider ‘revenge’ to be the holier place of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, much like the Buddha is the ‘refuge’ for the Buddhist awaiting enlightenment...the wife is the holier place, the mystery of initiation; holding the veil to the spiritual palace where we each ‘become’ and triumph over ourselves...revenge on the darkness (N.O.X.) is the effulgence of light (L.V.X.); though they each share an eternal relation and each originate in the infinite—one being the thought of God and the other, outside the thought and as such, the desire of God. Cf. my commentaries to the Gnostic Gospels for more on the ‘thought of the godhead.’ I suppose this Holy place gives us its broader unseen power. Perhaps it sets events in motion - an unseen hand. Of course, the spirit world is invisible in this world...but we can also see in this world an aggregate result (e.g. the market and its invisible hand ala Adam Smith) from the choices and actions of the many individuals that comprise society. When Osiris was slain by Set, it was Isis, his wife, who calculated the revenge."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"I am Libra rising and have thought about this in light of Treasurehouse of Images, but not in connection to Vengeance. I have thought about it in regards to balancing the Hermetic and Jewish Kabbalah. All of CCXXII from beginning to end is a balancing act. We are certainly making adjustments. I suppose justice hinges on vengeance. Is not justice but a vicarious vengeance? Through the medium of a legal procedure where one is declared guilty of transgression...of upsetting the natural order and in need of punishment in order to come to a new order; or the restoration of the old order...depending on the severity of the transgression. Well, is this not also the nature of evolution in a world whose formula is change=stability?...a world of constant change; constantly moving from stasis to disequilibrium and back to stasis. And so vengeance is always the new and higher ordering of reality and with the most egregious of transgressions or the most extreme of changes, it happens on a more spiritual plane. In other words, if the ‘crime’ is marcher, the murder victim is not un-murdered w/justice...but on a spiritual plane, the soul is said to find rest and so the loved one’s of the victim find spiritual restoration of equilibrium....peace. This law business ties into the title Book of the Law. I think we have struck at the heart of the whole matter with this. Law = 252 = laughter. He who laughs last -- vengeance on another level. AL II.63: \"Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress of Hell's own worm.\" THE OLD COMMENT Each breath, as He drew it in, was an orgasm; each breath, as it went out, was a new dissolution into death. Note that throughout these books death is always spoken of as a definite experience, a delightful event in one's career. THE NEW COMMENT This verse conceals a certain Magical Formula of the loftiest initiations. It refers to a method of using the breath, in connexion with the appropriate series of ideas, which is perhaps not to be taught directly. But it may be learnt by those who have attained the necessary degree of magical technique, suggested automatically to them by Nature Herself, just as newly-hatched chickens pick up corn without instruction. See Liber HAD. “Hell’s own worm” is, of course, Hadit. I have made another discovery: 'Love is the Law' equals 395, also coward and cower. This bothered me somewhat at first in that it might disprove the whole thing. The truth is that Just laws are based on Love, wouldn't you say? But it is the coward who loves because it is the law. He loves because he fears not to love. His love is of a discount nature, if it is love at all. The love of a dog showing belly flesh on command. This is the first half of our law, the half for the lower men. The second half is Love under Will, as I'm sure you know. This must be the Law for the courageous, who Love because it is directed by Will. I don’t know that I would go with the idea of a law made by man and written in books...but continue with the idea of ‘natural law’ like the law of gravity. And first thing that comes to mind here is: AL III.46: \"I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, & are abased. I will bring you to victory & joy: I will be at your arms in battle & ye shall delight to slay. Success is your proof; courage is your armour; go on, go on, in my strength; & ye shall turn not back for any!\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" THE NEW COMMENT Forty is Mem, Water, the Hanged Man; and Eighty is Pe, Mars, the blasted Tower. These Trumps refer respectively to the \"Destruction of the World by Water\" and \"by Fire.\" The meaning of these phrases is to be studied in my Rituals of Magick, such as Book 4, Parts II & III. Its general purport is that He is master of both types of Force. I am inclined to opine that there is a simpler and deeper sense in the text than I have so far disclosed. Next to mind is that I think of the lover as opposite the warrior: AL III.57: \"Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, but play; all fools despise!\" And don’t we “play” at love and in love? This line of thinking has evoked images of this scripture: 10. Get the stele of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple -- and that temple is already aright disposed -- & it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day. Close it in locked glass for a proof to the world. 11. This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. I will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trample down the Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat! The woman girt with a sword is an image of Justice, wouldn't you say? Flesh, animal, and Leo equals 75. It reminds me of Christians fed to lions, this eating flesh business. We will trample down the heathen, those Kabbalists who do not accept Liber Al, with the power of this Thelemic scriptural Kabbalah. The beginning of this verse speaks of the proof: obtaining the Stele. Color will return to it. I take this as applying our ideas of Kabbalah to the Stele. This way we might obtain it and cause its color to return. 260= color & copy. I have a copy of it! 290= colour & geometry - British spelling used in Al. both spellings yield interesting results. I’m not really sure of what you’re trying to say here...but there is reason to consider this idea of trampling down the heathen; as you say. Any Qabalah must hit into the mythos of a society in the same way that Crowley has created something around which a minor movement has established itself within the spiritual/occult community. But our work here is yet, a tiny subgroup that I can’t count ten people are even remotely interested in. So we’re not yet to smite anyone or anything at all. Our triumph is the Gnosis we’re sharing in this dialogue and the fire it is fueling for us here...this is where our passion is best placed. Whatever the future will bring it will bring and who are we to presume we have any idea at all of what that might be; especially when getting a grip on right now is presenting its own difficulties."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"3.

Leah Hirsig claimed she could direct this force with a look, like an evil eye. None shall stand before us could be interpreted as 0 shall stand before us, Kether by the numeration of CCXXII. Very good!...I like the 0 of Kether standing before “us” in the City of Pyramids. But of course, that is far more an anagogic interpretation of the line. So rather, I like the idea of “none shall stand before you” with the idea that “you” is each one of us in our own expression of pure will with no enslaver haunting our minds in much the same way that Hadit teaches that “no god shall deny” us. AL:II.22 \"I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.\" AL:II.23 \"I am alone: there is no God where I am.\" There is no God where I am ties in nicely with none shall stand before you. There is no God but Nuit and I. All other Gods are us -- or they are false. That is a dangerous heresy you have inspired in me. That's an uncomfortable level of responsibility! I don’t understand what you mean by this either. I wonder about our New Aeon. Is this an Aeon in itself, or is this a clearing of the way before the beginning of the Aquarian age in the 24th Century? There are a lot of leaves to rake up, if that's the case. Remember that the Aeons should not be confused with the astrological ages of the Platonic cycle. Rather that they are distinct stages in the evolution of humanity; the first being the Isis or Matriarchal period where humanity was entirely dependent upon nature in the most naïve manner; simply waiting to scoop up whatever resources nature handed out and women were like gods in that they made more people. The second age, the age of Osiris and the Patriarchy was when humanity began to understand nature and no longer depended on chance for its survival; but rather learned agriculture and to till the land, as much that men were involved in the process of childbirth. In a sense, we have the dialectic...point being nature as the divine provider and divine withholder...counterpoint being"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"humanity’s transcendence over nature and the formation of culture and the city-state. The third and transcendent point (the Integral Aeon) where we come to see both that nature herself is wonderous and as divine as is humanity and in our transcendence of her, we return to her as masters of ourselves! She was the behind the scenes element without whom the revenge of Horus would not have taken place. Hell hath no fury, they say. But of course, Isis relied on Thoth/Hermes for the Magick...and it was their ‘belated’ child (not from any expected house) that avenged Osiris. This is a good point and it supports the mythological interpretation of events in light of Al. The revenge of Horus' victory in battle was the capstone on a much larger work. I suppose women are free from the lust for glory, to a larger extent. I wouldn’t say that...perhaps a certain passivity has been conditioned into them in generations past...but that’s changing. I would agree with the idea that women are changing. Everyone is changing. I wonder what Crowley would say if he observed our time for a month? He would note that in the moment the women have taken too much power and that the women have to learn to mature in their power. I could see this in the emergence of Wicca as a female dominated religion. They seemed to go too far with the woman power mentality, an over correction. This is probably for the best in the long term. lol...get into the Alexandrian group...”my lady”, “my lady” all over the place...and the men willingly make themselves slaves of these women...I know, I used to date one...and let me assure you, I wasn’t her slave. And I can tell you a funny story about this...remind me some time. I should take a chance to thank you, PJ. I have grown quite a bit in this last couple of weeks. I feel head and shoulders above my previous stature in Kabbalah and philosophy. Our conversation and your guidance have fostered this. There have been times I over-reached and times I stumbled -- missed the mark, but more often we have both soared. I feel like Liber Al is opening up! I don't think that's a hollow boast, either. I think there is a lot more gold in this vein of thinking. That’s the way you learn...be courageous enough to spit out your ideas...some of them will be great, some mediocre and some will suck...then think through everything and prune...then rewrite, rewrite, rewrite...review, review, review...talk and converse with others....play around with some more ideas...improvise, bullshit...brainstorm...grow, think again...until at any such moment...all of a suddem...wait for it...here it comes.........."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Aha! of course, sit back now, have a cigarette and make sure that you cuddle for a bit. ;-) You are a natural teacher and a man of vast patience.

The Juggler is indeed a man of play, but I hadn't thought of this and his connection to Binah. I had thought about the connection between the wife and the play of lovers, as you had mentioned earlier. Taking revenge on the wife in bed had crossed my mind as well! I had also thought about how I have learned to despise those who claim to have crossed the abyss and thus become 'fools', making me lust for revenge of a more martial nature. For my answer I was thinking about Liber 222 in particular. I had recorded it and left it very simple: “A warning that strikes close to home, too much gematria and not enough ritual, does not a good magickian make.\" Allow me to write a moral: There are many jugglings in which a magickian can engage.

The riddle presented here must maintain consistency with the EQ. And there’s no way the graph page gives us the value of 7 for the letter ‘D’. All of this is JSK’s ridiculous idea. And G. Mortimer simply compounds the initial error by thinking he ‘discovered’ this. What discovery?...he invented this, as he found the end he wanted and made it work...this sort of reverse Qabalah practice is on a par with other forms of sophistry, like Christian Qabalah. And for your error; that the letters equal 400 and gives us the value in your system for the ampersand, what does that teach us?...where’s the sublimity and beauty that should accompany the solution?

That 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27 tells us nothing because on the other hand, 27 is not a key...that belongs to 31. What about the idea that the line connects words that give us the following sentence...?... chance, its failure is a key also...in other words, experience (the way of the Gnostic) is the best teacher. Also, the cross in the circle fails to touch the circle with 2 of the 4 arms; east and south...this is a Western Magick. The east is the path of the Chinese and the South is outside our zodiac (though my good friend Slobodan wrote a great book on the subject of the southern zodiac that I commented on: Citatiza-Tet Tarot Interpolated). “This circle squared in it's failure is a key also,” equals 2314.

However, the argument for 222"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"on its own is quite strong and I would sugges this: Put the ampersand at the end so that we get “x, y, z, and per se and” as the condensed word is a finalizing expression and not an expression for a middle term. Then the value changes to 900 and puts it on a par with the double-Pi of the Greek Qabalah: In few ancient Greek cities, the double sigma ΢΢ was represented as a T. This gradually took the form of a rotated Pi Π: , and in the byzantine times it took the name ςαμπι or ςαμπεί from: «ωσ αν πει» → (=as though -it was- Pi) *san`pi+ → *sam`pi+ *sam`bi+. Sampi represents the number 900. I've thought about what you said and I've decided to let the matter rest. I may have been rash or too close to the whole thing to get the right perspective. I'm going to put my grade work first and reconsider everything after some time has passed. I do have to address your last statement, though. The system you propose sounds like the Z.E.Q. I have no personal stake against it. I thought Cohen was very perceptive in including the ampersand but I think he didn't go far enough. I am convinced that the Berashith method must be applied to the order and value of all the letters including the ampersand; and I think the paths worked out in a very interesting way in 222. To my mind, excluding one letter from the method of the other 26 is like stopping at the finish line. & may have some things in common with sampi, but English is a different system with different values. I agree with you on all counts. Yes, the Task of your Grade is far more important than anything. However, that you continue to apply your qabalistic skills is a part of your Task. There’s a lot I like about what you’ve done and it is inspiring. There’s also the same feelings for the ideas Ryan and I have worked on. There’s strong argument for the ampersand and strong argument in keeping it out altogether as the natural evolution of the language has done. This is why initially I said...let’s pursue both tracks to see what happens. It’s even possible that both can have value. The problem with Cohen and Zintel is twofold...1) they got into all these values of less than one 0.011239455 etc. And these numbers are illusory: the difference between 666 and .666 is 665.334...so the two numbers aren’t even close. And the second problem is ego...they think they own their ideas and give the gods credit for nothing...they are the world type of atheist...narcissistic sociopaths...and I know this from living with them. I have to disagree with you again. The ampersand is a very well used letter. The fact that it is thought of as punctuation is more from ignorance and misguided education than any shortcoming of the letter itself. The ampersand is very commonly used in corporation names, especially in law firms and doctor's offices -- the legendary law practice of Dewey, Cheetham & Howe is one example. That it is not used in typed material is probably more due to it's unorthodox location on the keyboard. I certainly can't speak about Cohen and Zintel from a first-hand basis, but the A.'.A.'. would be a good place to go if you're a narcissist. You get to blow yourself up real big and you can build a pyramid of students under you. I don't know what to think about their Kabbalah skills. I applaud the fact that they use the ampersand. The fact that they assign letters to Sephiroth makes me doubt them very seriously. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"If they are Atheists it might explain their confusion.

You get to blow yourself up real big and you can build a pyramid of students under you. I don't know what to think about their Kabbalah skills. I applaud the fact that they use the ampersand. The fact that they assign letters to Sephiroth makes me doubt them very seriously. This is very much because of what you suspect below...and yes, the Sefirotic idea was too much for me...after our split, I was happy to remove that crap and all their decimal numbers. I watched the two of them go to work on this and told them to leave me out of those discussions...and knew it was taking them to senselessness. If they are Atheists it might explain their confusion. Perhaps they see the Tree as just a form - place values in the blanks - it doesn't really mean anything . The world is whatever you say it is. As far as these decimal numbers go, I don't see a need to split hairs and go into these increments. It's not like you're going to spell a word with a fraction of a letter.

I find it hard to believe people can remain in these mindsets when confronted with the occult for so long. You know what they say, people get the teacher they deserve. These people might not be ready for the introduction of infinite consciousness into their lives. It's too bad because I think science is going to go to that, in a big way with particle consciousness and quantum field theories. Knowledge is going to come out no matter what and I know these theories have been in the oven for a while now. A matter of time. I tell you this, not to toot my own horn, but I have found the secret to teaching children. You show them the Flower of Life Matrix first. It's like a magic trick to them if you get them at the right age because this thing just seems to build itself on paper. Then you can go all kinds of directions with it: art, geometry, religion, astronomy, myth, number theory, Platonic solids, Metatron's Cube -- or it can just be coloring flowers or a connect the dots type game. I was teaching my son about it just yesterday. My son would rather listen to me talk than play video games, not because I'm all that interesting -- no, I tie it into the Matrix of Life and the Tree of Life. Those are my hooks. Without this background the Tree, for many occultists, is just some abstract baloney. The same way that, for my son, school geometry was a practically useless formality. Now it's all different, geometry matters and is interesting. From that first circle I drew, many strange and varied subjects sprang, like magic -- like flowers blooming. They have to come up with a gimmick to sell Kabbalah to the Atheist -- this file cabinet idea. It isn't a bad tactic, but we both know its baby's milk. I suppose Eales must still be on this teat. My son was particularly impressed when I showed him the Tree growing from the intersections of the Matrix lines and how the planets relate to numbers and how God reflects through the flaming sword creating denser realms and number and natural law like a lightning bolt from nowhere. It's not some dry, schizophrenic, Atheistic 'facts' like he learns in school, it's dynamic and exciting and unified. There's a story involved. It turns on both sides of the brain. Kabbalistic primers would do well to start with the Matrix first and leave the Tree for later. On that background, the question of God is almost redundant. It becomes nearly self-evident: the first cause is intelligent. Then again, if the people are narcissists they aren't going to get it. Their equipment isn't functioning.

But more than for a few individuals; unless prophecy is accepted on a community scale, it can have no profound import; though it be profound in and of itself.

The problem with Ray Eales types is that they think ‘well and with business way’ is to make a profit...I think ‘well and with business way’ is about convincing other people to see great ideas. And great ideas are always ahead of their time; always someone that lays down and sacrifices (makes offerings) on their behalf. Thelemites still behave as though they were still Christians needs yet, to do this. But we are all victims of the conditioning of our culture in one way, shape or form. Still, some strive to see and others are more reactionary.

I am aware that this is a bit of an outside view, but I pose a thought; comment if you like. Crowley explained, geometrically, that Kether was the first point and Chokma the second. By this a line could be formulated. I pose a different scenario. I say that before a point can be made, an intelligent matrix, an awareness must be found upon which a point can"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"be formulated. Without this, observation of the point is impossible. The second point can never form a line unless the connection is observed, unless the points are charted. Kether, being zero, is the awareness in the empty space that must exist before any point, line, plane or three dimensional object can be observed at all. A point must be observable before it can exist. Kether is that prime awareness that is not a point in itself, thus zero -- it is intelligent space, but not a thing itself. It is an infinite perspective. It is raw, boundless awareness. The point is not the first step in geometry; the awareness that graphs the point is. This is the prime cause -- awareness fused into the very emptiness of the void. Perhaps it is like a child's awareness that a clean piece of paper exists without doodles -- a first cause that, in itself, does not mark the paper, but leads to its eventually being filled. By the way, I really enjoyed your latest publication. Very thought provoking. I particularly liked your treatment of the Sphinx. This treading on serpents business seems to be a recurring theme. Of course, your Tree is very controversial and flies in the face of the Pythagorean geometry that supports the traditional tree. The awareness that you speak of sounds much to me like the desire of Babalon, which puts it in the AIN SOPH AUR (the real zero or NOT). Kether is the concentrated point that is formulated in the AIN, which needs to be ignored to support your tree. This begs a whole new philosophy and geometry...so it would be safe to say you’ve more opened a can of worms than found a solution. But that’s ok too...isn’t that what it’s all about anyway? Is not the Thelemic Qabalah about innovation? With Tzaddi, Crowley found a way to innovate by re-establishing a traditional placement...an interesting balance for him, as it brought a greater symmetry to the cards; shown in the Moebius Ribbon. You’ve created an interesting internal construct...it works well in its own paradigm...but in the larger scheme of things, it has an uphill battle. And that’s ok...if you give it the time and proper detachment/objectivity to allow synchronicity to do its job.

I think our emerging quantum science places great emphasis on the influence of the observer. This observation of the original void of creation, I say, is the first emanation and not the point. I view it as the abstract zero of the Ain Soph becoming the very real zero of mathematics inside creation ('real' here defined as created reality). It goes from No-Thing, to the observation of actual nothing, meaning voidness. The zero of the three veils denote, to me, not a lack, but a lack of limit. Perhaps it is a difference between Nu and Nuit, Nu being a primordial, omni-gendered god existing before and outside of Tzimtzum. Tzimtzum can also denote the willed ignorance of God as a mechanism to enable true free Will. If this line is taken, the observer becomes much more important. I was thinking about the speed of planets, which is what got me on this track, not Kabbalah itself. I think it's strange that people say the Earth is moving at a certain speed. This can only be true relative to another object in space. Unfortunately there is no known stationary object in space, only other moving objects. True speed, therefore, can never be known, if it exists. The voidness of space is the zero point, the unknowable stationary point, that must be approximated somehow. Even this isn't really true because voidness cannot have speed or lack of speed. It is the observational point that precedes the mapping of the first point that is the most important aspect. My son was questioning me about astrology the other day. He said the school had taught him astrologers believed in the Geocentric model. I, of course, destroyed that misconception by telling him of weather astrology (and added the fact that Heliocentrism was discovered by astrologers). The whole thing is set up centered on the farm of the farmer who pays the astrologer for a weather prediction. This is why the almanac, I said, doesn't predict the weather much better than the news, because they are predicting for a whole region. Were the same people predicting for our own yard, we'd see a much more accurate forecast. Here again, the point of observation is overlooked and misunderstood. Each man is his own center regardless of what revolves around whatever else. This line of thinking can take us into the Axis Mundi, World Tree, Tree of Life, the Middle Pillar exercise, and beyond.

It reminds me, vaguely, of the Golden Dawn's Rose Cross lamen -- particularly the flower petals with the Hebrew letters. It also reminds me of the knowledge lectures of the Golden Dawn. Perhaps this was a circulated knowledge letter of some sort for a masonic group. Interesting is the word 'felon' used to refer to the fingers. Felon is a very old term for finger joints. There is some sort of grip that forms the hexagram. It also says something about this being a 'key' to reading something. I've certainly never seen this before. Were there anymore pages like this?

I say I was not ready for it, but what I mean is my brain was not ready. My thoughts rebelled against what was happening. Maybe my personality feared to be destroyed by this new perspective. I felt like I was going over the edge. I was totally sober too, no drugs or alcohol. The joy I felt was like the euphoria of the last half of an acid trip. It was euphoria and total fear all at once. Have you ever had an experience like that? This is an authentic spiritual experience that some describe as the awakening of the Kundalini Serpent. It was bring euphoria and paranoia...peace and horror. You’ve also seen at least a brief opening of the heart chakra as the Kundaline pushed energy around. This confirms my idea of greatness in you...you will have more of these in different and unexpected ways as time and your work with Our Order moves forward.  Here is another finding that I contributed to our EQ Sepher Sepheroth back in the summer of 2009.

[11:38:04 AM] William Higgins: (2/1) * * --- Now cometh the glory of the Single One, as an imperfection and stain. The glory of the single one is the brilliance of the LVX, the divine light of nature and creation. This is the first departure from equilibrium since the silence of no-thing-ness must now be broken in order to express a particular idea. This departure from silence begins with the establishment of a creative potential. A tendency or a verge to motion which is the creative impulse; this creative impulse can imply the Fool on one level, while its creative nature indicates the Magus Atu on another. The idea of a single thing, a potentiality has now been introduced. This is indicated by the solid line appearing below the three points. [The letter H with the value of 1 in the EQ] The letter H suggests the arising of the breath, in a way it suggests the breath of God, the Elohim passing over the Chaotic waters of genesis. The H also expresses the idea of a ladder in its shape, so here we have a connecting point. The H is assigned the number one being the first English letter to appear in the Book of the Law, thus the singularity is the holy spirit of creation acting as a ladder to the purity of no-thing-ness; or rather, energetic matter in its equilibrated state. One could also add that it is the breath of spirit which ruffles the equilibrium leading to manifestation. This breath refers to the prana or chi, as that electric component of the ether which moves the prime matter into its particular forms. The Magus"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"This idea of a single thing as the modus of creation suggests a primal creator analogous to the creativity expressed in the Magus Atu of the Tarot. The Magus is the creative Word and the subtle electric force informing all things, its subtlety and occult nature is similar to that expressed in this trigram. In the Book of Thoth Crowley explains that: “...He is the messenger of the gods, represents precisely that Lingam, the Word of creation whose speech is silence.”(Crowley p.70) He adds: “He is, in the language of modern physics, that electric charge which is the first manifestation of the ring of ten indefinable ideas, as previously explained. He is thus continuous creation.” (Cf: Crowley p. 70) (3/2) * * - - But by the Weak One the Mother was it equilibrated. Here the positive assertion of a nameless something, that idea of existence in general given in the last symbol is now equilibrated with its opposite idea. Crowley often asserts that above the abyss each idea contains and necessarily asserts its own contradiction: for instance one cannot have even the most basic undefined sensation of ‘I’ or ‘me’ without accepting the awareness of that which is ‘not I’. So here we have the idea of negative existence introduced as the condition of all positive existence. This is a different kind of ‘not’ however, unlike the silence of no-thing introduced by ‘nothing in its three forms’ we now have ‘not’ as the negation of a given thing. This however occurs on a much more universal and broader level since we are dealing with existence and non existence in general, the universal archetype informing the existence and non-existence of all particular things. [The letter A with the value of 2 in the EQ] The value of the number two connotes femininity since it is an even number capable of absorbing the masculine potencies of odd numbers such as the number one. The letter A connotes a sense of beginning and excellence suggesting that the logos can only begin to manifest itself in the presence of both opposites, thus invoking the necessity of equilibrium in all magickal operations. The shape of this letter suggests man as the pentagram who’s fulfilled potential is excellence. His consciousness is the feminine vessel which equilibrates that light. The Empress The Empress seems to support the ideas expressed in this particular verse, since she is the ‘mother’ and it is she who provides the gate or doorway to manifestation and initiation. (4/3) * --- * Also the purity was divided by Strength, the force of the Demiurge. If we picture the two contraries just discussed, that is the archetypal positive and negative forces as arising on a continuum, like the poles of a magnet, we can see that there is no strict division between opposites introduced: just opposite yet complimentary ideas. Now the Demiurge as the Gnostic creator god or the grand architect only begins creation once the idea of division is introduced. The strength referred to here is analogous to the creative power, much like the creative maya which is magickally projected as an expression of Shiva’s potency when he creates the universe in certain Hindu legends. Here it is helpful to refer to Liber Al vel Legis. In chapter one Nuit says: “For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union.” (ch. 1: l.29) And she adds: “This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.” (Cf: Al: ch.1 l.30) Following this she prescribes the following moral injunction: “For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all!...” (l. 31) This is"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"what differs the master of the Temple from the Black brother: the Master of the Temple is open about this selfishness and asserts it as enlightened self interest, while the black brother hides behind a façade of humility and selflessness as we will see when we look at the tenth trigram. [The letter D with the value of 3 in the EQ] This is one of the most obvious attributions since the letter ‘D’ suggests division. Also note that the letter ‘D’ can also connote ‘dunce’ within English nomenclature suggesting an ignorant quality as being part of the creative strength of the demiurge. This also deals with the themes of Liber Al in which power is associated with a-rationality: “If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops &does nought.” (Cf: Al: ch. 2 l. 30) The Emperor I associate the Emperor Atu in the Tarot with this trigram since the emperor suggests the intuitive logic used by those powerful leaders that are able to make those split second (and often arbitrary) ‘executive decisions’. The Emperor suggests strength, and the strength of will to ‘divide and conquer’ a quality associated with rulers throughout the ages. (5/4) * - - * And the Cross was formulated in the Universe that as yet was not. This division automatically gives rise to an underlying structure of equilibrium informing the universe as it is created by pure will. This implies the cross which portrays an underlying integral structure upon which all etheric manifestations are based. It implies law and equilibrium and it is this principle that informs our sense of ‘karma’ which is not concerned with morality in the personal sentimental sense, but with simple cause and effect. In our imagination we can have whatever we want, yet we cannot create anything in our imagination without establishing denotative limits. To imagine a circle implies that it is not a square. If you define a triangle as a three sided shape then you cannot imagine a four sided triangle. Nothing can be created without these preliminary parameters; similarly even though a game is just a game, one still needs to invent rules in order to give a game its particular character. Thus the rules we encounter in the ‘world’ reflect more conditions of the human mind: this means rules for interpreting and perceiving the world in a way that is intelligible to our consciousness. Thus natural law as ‘cause’ or ‘because’ described in Liber Al is an effect of Will not the other way around as vulgar science would have us believe. Hume says reason is a slave to the passions. The silent self in Liber Al vel Legis exclaims: “Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite and unknown; and all their words are skew-wise.” (l.. [11:38:09 AM] William Higgins: Not yet...

As a logogram, it is a non-letter and comes back to zero. The problem that you might be anticipating then is its placement on the Tree and I haven’t looked at this yet. But it seems to me we can find some way to keeping the placement on the tree in the same way that Crowley found the Moebius Ribbon for Tzaddi. About the new college it's hard to say, but the new atus is a given. [12:01:33 PM] Paul Rovelli: The new Atus would fall through Da'ath as its center...Da'ath becomes an active Sefira that has connections through both the rosy cross and the silver star I don't know what to tell you just yet. I was taking a break today. My son was sick and I'm not feeling much better. I'm a little drunk from the Vapor-rub fumes. We decided to watch Star Wars 4, 5, & 6. You guys really filled up my inbox while I wasn't looking, so give me some time to process the conversation. I do want to make one point, though. I disagree with the idea that the ampersand is not a member of the alphabet any longer. I say it is and will continue to be a letter until it is no longer used. This is the only requirement I recognize. It matters not who agrees or disagrees with it's status or how they order the letters, it is, pragmatically speaking, a letter until it is no longer used. For this reason it cannot be stricken from the true alphabet no matter what form the 'official' alphabet takes. I also think that in informal handwriting the ampersand tends to get more usage than Q and Z and J. I was reading an article that the ampersand appears in almost every European language. Try it out in Google Translate. I think the nearly universal nature of it cannot be taken lightly. I think it may be possible to keep it on the tree, much in the same manner as the fool as Qabalistic 0 is on the tree. I agree with you on the ubiquity of the ampersand and am seeing it as a necessary consideration. But a Qabalah is so much more than a single logogram...indeed, this difference from the phonograms (being the other 26) should give us flexibility. As you will see in the posts...some of this is discussed. == Sorry to hear you and your son have been ill. Looking forward to seeing you well and back in the saddle again. If the ampersand becomes the Fool...H...becomes the Magus. ...and of course, there is the issue of yet, five Atus to design...and maybe to re-design a whole new Tarot. 805 just addresses gematria and notariqon. 27 and 222 as well as Paul Thomas’ work on AL & ToL expand out from this. I think it also important, my recent work on the manuscript of AL and the work on the Starry Gnosis that I am preparing at this time. And the whole of the EQ has to find its way into the Thelemic canon that we include other components of the mythos and magick. And then the Tarot can be gleaned."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"I have written that prophecy needs a community to accept it...because it must en-fever (for want of a better term) a community...not just one or two. Otherwise it’s vain fancy...so that four of us together can lead to more as in time, we develop this more completely that it becomes edited into the discourse between teacher and student in the A.’.A.’.—and between congregant and mentor in our Gnostic churches. This is the challenge before us. something about H starting the order of the letters and Q at their end...HQ (headquarters)...the Alpha et Omega I don't think anyone here wants to exclude the ampersand from the alphabet; rather to recognize that it is of an entirely different character (pun intended) from the other letters in that it is more of a symbolic nature rather than a phonetic one. It is a single character that denotes an idea and a word first... it is also the only letter that can only be used for one meaning and which can only be used by itself. If we take it's odd nature into consideration in addition to qabalistic implications of it's shape: i.e. the infinity symbol with a small cross attached ( 8+ gives us &) we see a pictorial representation of the all as in the unity of infinity with finitude... the alpha and the omega, the hermaphrodite, and may I dare say the great work accomplished? p.s. Wishes of health and vigor to you and your family. My daughter has been struggling with the flu and I also just got over a lung infection... (not fun) but the winds of vitality are picking up for me again as I'm sure they will for you. That’s interesting...tying the ampersand w/the alpha et omega...as I was doing with H and Q in my previous post...and let’s now connect HQ – headquarters in terms of vengeance and the war-engine on that island that’s dunged about with enginery of war. The ampersand is a connector, it has a logical function, which is something that is much more than just a letter...and maybe in much the same way as in physics—where fermions are carried by bosons...bosons not really being particulate matter in the same ways as the sub-atomic particles called fermions. And the fact that the ampersand makes a 27 path Tree-of-Life available shows the new inroads to consciously that possibly even technology and the Kurzweil ‘singularity’ may be introducing. These may account for the extra five paths...and the connector...that mysterious link...the symbol of the Rosy Cross that can be veiled into the ampersand...this can also link the alphabet to spiritual force...that island, dunged about...et al. And it plays into the involutionary-evolutionary scheme that the Qabalah teaches; bringing the EQ to the status of a more full Qabalah for the philosophy, mythos and paradigm that is Thelema. So we get the HQ, Holy Qabalah, plus (Hebrew Qabalah/ the other half of the Jews) Also a reference to the alpha and the omega which is contained in the ampersand itself. As a connector it is a glyf for the astral light or the ether which connects all things. This HQ is also the head quarters by which Ra Hoor Khuit seeks his vengeance on the Demiurge, which seeks to blind us to our freedom and divinity. Wow...HQ...Holy Qabalah...didn’t see that...cool! As I was writing my commentaries to the ancient Gnostic texts, I came upon some ideas in the Sethian manuscripts; that shows the Demiurge and the Savior cooperating in the creation. The Savior originates from the ‘thought’ of the godhead and the Demiurge oringates ‘without the thought’ ... hence in my view, the creation is a conjunction (ampersand) of ‘Is’ and ‘Is-Not’ or ‘within’ and ‘without.’ This in more"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Thelemic terms would seem to be the L.V.X. (thought) and the N.O.X. (outside the thought). It grants acceptance to the material Universe and not the abhorrence of what most scholars have attached themselves (being more interested in Valentinian Gnosticism) along with the extreme and nearly psychotic behavior of PKD. Hi Guys...another thought...perhaps even the extra paths on the ToL might be the four watchtowers of the Abyss...showing Knowledge to be an articulate chasm. Hi PJ, this is an interesting thought, though I'd have to really meditate some more on it. The fifth would be the tablet of union? I haven’t fully thought this out at all...it was just a thought that filtered through my head while I was finishing the Starry Gnosis book. I remembered something Ed said during the original 222 project...something like: Knowledge is not a strange attainment in the modern world. Then of course, there are the ‘lonely towers’ – and I thought, in a dumbed-down society as we have today and in more traditionally, ignorant societies, knowledge is something that can make anyone very lonely. It is a strange world where so much information is available from so many sources, but people are more dull than ever. Ignorance is a choice. Knowledge was hidden in the past, but now it is unveiled -- and mostly neglected. I do not complain, this is just an observation without judgment.

The rearrangement of the vowels in EQ (AOUIE) is worth examination.

Also there is the matter of the crossed out sections of the MS etc. etc. how many ampersands in those? do they count? etc. etc. etc. ;-)93 93/93AL-Ways JSK.

Perhaps we are talking about Jesus Christ in the hidden, Gnostic sense, as opposed to the Pauline version. On a slight tangent away from the original topic: I'm beginning to see Liber Legis as linked with the Revelation of St. John. Liber Legis definitely promises the revelation of the new letters in English. 251 Revelations; old letters; The Revelation of St. John (which is almost always said pluralized, \"Revelations,\" by everyone I've ever heard say it) has 22 chapters, just as the old letters were 22 in number.

Perhaps we are talking about Jesus Christ in the hidden, Gnostic sense, as opposed to the Pauline version. I could accept better ‘Christ’ in the Gnostic sense...Jesus, though also the name attached is only in the modern sense a name with first and surname. In the Gnostic world, it was ‘Jesus the Christ’ and Christ was not a surname. In the original EQ, 848 (the total value of the name, Jesus Christ) has no value; nor does 655 (the value the ampersand position gives to Jesus). However, in the original EQ, Jesus Christ = Jesus/555 + Christ/193 = 748. 555 also equals Geburah, abstruction and peck (as in “I peck at the eyes of Jesus”) and 193 (same value in both systems) equals Holy One, Image of God, Saturnus, Creeds, Cries, Rapid. 748 (the combined number of Jesus + Christ) has no value in the original system, which is good again, because it’s not a real name. This increases the argument for putting the ampersand at the end of the alphabet. On a slight tangent away from the original topic: I'm beginning to see Liber Legis as linked with the Revelation of St. John. Liber Legis definitely promises the revelation of the new letters in English. 251 Revelations; old letters; The Revelation of St. John (which is almost always said pluralized, \"Revelations,\" by everyone I've ever heard say it) has 22 chapters, just as the old letters were 22 in number. I have even read that Revelation is explanatory of the Tarot. It's more often used as a tool of terror these days, however, which brings me to this little nugget: 241 Revelation; vampire; I think this captures the truer spelling and flavor of the book. It would probably be interesting for some qabalist to attempt to find a corollary between the Hebrew alphabet and each of the 22 chapters in Revelation(s). And perhaps, even some magickal value; may even cross-indexed with the English alphabet. Certainly, to understand the Book of Revelation in Thelemic terms, one needs to study Liber 418 carefully, as I’ve shown in my articles on Babalon and the Beast. I’ve also looked at Revelation from a few other angles, such as in Liber Restituo; wherein I show the letters to the seven churches to have some correlation with the seven chakras in a tantric process. And in other parts, we learn of John’s hatred for the goddess encoded into symbols of the Beast and Babalon; stated so eloquently in Peter Grey’s The Red Goddess. Of course also, the 4 Horseman are shown in the Enochian system with their sigils on the Enochian tablets...this feeds us back to the new paths on the ToL and placing them through Da’ath. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"848 here does suggest something very problematic, first for the reasons PJ noted, such as Jesus Christ not being a true name. However I would add more simply that Jesus Christ is definitely not the key to the rituals as per the context of Liber Al vel Legis, and thus throws into question this current valuation of the remaining letters in terms of their hermeneutica value. This is a contradictory statement. If 'Jesus Christ' isn't a true name, then the value is not true. For this reason the value must be thrown out, or it should be accepted as a name. It can't be both. I assume these first numbers are a reference that you are using...but don’t know why you’re concerned specifically with 500 and above...it’s the individual letters and the values that are different between the two alphabetical structures that we’re trying to analyze. The values of 500 and above are important here because nothing has changed that has a value less than 500. Everything above 500 either contains the letters &, K, J, Z, X, and Q, or, if not containing those letters, may, in many cases, be compared with words that do. I don't understand your statement here when you write: This is a contradictory statement. If 'Jesus Christ' isn't a true name, then the value is not true. For this reason the value must be thrown out, or it should be accepted as a name. It can't be both. What exactly is contradictory about my statement? My point is that the value may indeed not be true: a moot point. I figured that was implicit in the adjective 'problematic'. Am I missing something here? How is my response contradictory? "}]
