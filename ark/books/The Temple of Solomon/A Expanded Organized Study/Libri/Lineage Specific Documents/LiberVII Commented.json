These are the Birth-Words of a Master of the Temple. The full knowledge of the interpretation of this book is concealed from all save only the Sixfold Star. The Neophyte must nevertheless acquire a copy and thoroughly acquaint himself with the contents. He must commit one chapter to memory. By authority of V.V.V.V.V. This book is published and issued. The comments were composed at the end of the Neophyte period by Frater Orpheus and represent solely the Aspirant's limited viewpoint. That apology put forth, this work also represents that same Aspirant's understanding after having worked the Thelemic system with over a decade of Aspiration to the Great Work. The lined in Bold are by NEMO (NEMO is the Master of the Temple whose task it is to develop the beginner.) The comments of Frater Orpheus are in Italic. PROLOGUE OF THE UNBORN Comment pencilled Sol in 20 [degrees] [Pisces] An. V [March 10-11, 1910ev] by NEMO. 1. Into my loneliness comes -- \"loneliness\". i.e. of Babe of Abyss. 2. The sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the uttermost hills. \"flute\". The flute of Pan. 3. Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wilderness. \"river\". Phrath. [One of the four rivers of Eden in Genesis.] \"wilderness\". The Abyss where is Choronzon. 4. And I behold Pan. \"Pan\". Sire of NEMO. 5. The snows are eternal above, above -- \"snows\". The three Supernals. 6. And their perfume smokes upward into the nostrils of the stars. \"stars\". Nuith. 7. But what have I to do with these? \"I\" have nothing to do with these... 8. To me only the distant flute, the abiding vision of Pan. \"I\" am not as the prophet is in a state of Samadhi... 9. On all sides Pan to the eye, to the ear; In the Great Sea of Binah. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"10. The perfume of Pan pervading, the taste of him utterly filling my mouth, so that the tongue breaks forth into a weird and monstrous speech. Hence, the Prophet speaks. 11. The embrace of him intense on every centre of pain and pleasure. Each chakkra is enflamed. 12. The sixth interior sense aflame with the inmost self of Him, The third eye, the Ajna chakkra is given to seeing this great vision. 13. Myself flung down the precipice of being From Chesed to Binah. 14. Even to the abyss, annihilation. That annihilation that enables one to cross the Abyss. 15. An end to loneliness, as to all. For the re are other Masters in the City of the Pyramids. 16. Pan! Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan! And what is to come in this Holy Book is the recording of what the Prophet beheld. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter I (Attributed to the sacred planet Mars) 1. My God, how I love Thee! 2. With the vehement appetite of a beast I hunt Thee through the Universe. The Shekinah yearning for the nuptial with the god-head. 3. Thou art standing as it were upon a pinnacle at the edge of some fortified city. I am a white bird, and perch upon Thee. The heights--a view from the Supernals. 4. Thou art My Lover: I see Thee as a nymph with her white limbs stretched by the spring. The longing, the hunger, holy desire. 5. She lies upon the moss; there is none other but she: \"She is benediction. She is addicted to thee. She is the rude connection. She is connecting with he...She is sublimation. She is the essence of thee. She is concentrating on he, the chosen of she.\" Patti Smith. 6. Art Thou not Pan? Pan is Nuit. 7. I am He. Speak not, O my God! Let the work be accomplished in silence. The Prophet silences God!? How commandeering! How martial and so filled with testosterone! (The Adept has balls!) 8. Let my cry of pain be crystallized into a little white fawn to run away into the forest! Let desire reach out to stroke the hair of Nuit, the trees of eternity. 9. Thou art a centaur, O my God, from the violet-blossoms that crown Thereto the hoofs of the horse. The centaur is a symbol of Sagittarius which leads from Yesod to Tiphareth. This is an invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. 10. Thou art harder than tempered steel; there is no diamond beside Thee. 11. Did I not yield this body and soul? The Exempt Adept gives up all to cross the Abyss. \"For if thou dost not this with thy will, then shall We do this despite thy will. Sothat thou attain to the Sacrament of the Graal in the Chapel of Abominations.\" Liber Cheth, v.11. 12. I woo thee with a dagger drawn across my throat. \"dagger\" is equivalent to the Oathof the Abyss. \"throat\" is equivalent to Da'ath. 13. Let the spout of blood quench Thy blood-thirst, O my God! More blood for the Cup of Babalon. This si hte sacramental blood of the saints poured out on this plane. And yet I wonder that it is not the bitter dregs for the higher life. 14. Thou art a little white rabbit in the burrow Night. The Alchemical 'White Eagle'? 15. I am greater than the fox and the hole. The Alchemical 'Red Lion'? "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"16. Give me Thy kisses, O Lord God! 17. The lightning came and licked up the little flock of sheep. And the dire to the crucible? 18. There is a tongue and a flame; I see that trident walking over the sea. 19. A phoenix hath it for its head; below are two prongs. They spear the wicked. Phoenix Wand. 20. I will spear Thee, O Thou little grey god, unless Thou beware! 21. From the grey to the gold; from the gold to that which is beyond the gold of Ophir. Finally, the completion of the Alchemical process that I have been guessing at in my previous comments. 22. My God! but I love Thee! 23. Why hast Thou whispered so ambiguous things? Wast Thou afraid, Ogoat-hoofed One, O horned One, O pillar of lightning? Again, a challenge to teh god-head!? How impudent! 24. From the lightning fall pearls; from the pearls black specks of nothing. Still, such vigor seems but to arouse the god-head. 25. I based all on one, one on naught. It all seems so calculated. 26. Afloat in the aether, O my God, my God! 27. O Thou great hooded sun of glory, cut off these eyelids! 28. Nature shall die out; she hideth me, closing mine eyelids with fear,she hideth me from My destruction, O Thou open eye. 29. O ever-weeping One! Binah--The Great Mother. She is the mistress of all Sorrow. \"And this is the wrath of God, that these things should be thus. And this is the grace of God, that these things should be thus.\" Liber Cheth, v. 17-18. 30. Not Isis my mother, nor Osiris my self; but the incestuous Horus given over to Typhon, so may I be! This verse a thought from mention of a weeping one. 31. There thought; and thought is evil. A correction from Aiwass. 32. Pan! Pan! Io Pan! it is enough. Invocation to regain aspiration. 33. Fall not into death, O my soul! Think that death is the bed into which you are falling! 34. O how I love Thee, O my God! Especially is there a vehement parallellight from infinity, vilely diffracted in the haze of this mind. The Ray of shaft of Arrows strikes Daath which dispe rses it. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"35. I love Thee. I love Thee. I love Thee. 36. Thou art a beautiful thing whiter than a woman in the column of thisvibration. 37. I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above. An intimation of Sagittarius as in verse 9 of this chapter. 38. But it is death, and the flame of the pyre. 39. Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my soul! Thy God is like the cold emptiness of the utmost heaven, into which thou radiatest thy little light. And again, the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. 40. When Thou shall know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire inThy great N. O. X. \"N.O.X.\" = [Tzaddi] [Ayin] [Nun] = ÔÅñ NOX. N=Mentu. O=Amoun. X=Isis Virgin. 41. What shalt Thou be, my God, when I have ceased to love Thee? 42. A worm, a nothing, a niddering knave! Both Nuit and Hadit yearn to each other to complete each other and become as one... Ra-Hoor-Khuit. 43. But Oh! I love Thee. 44. I have thrown a million flowers from the basket of the Beyond at Thy feet, I have anointed Thee and Thy Staff with oil and blood and kisses. 45. I have kindled Thy marble into life--ay! into death. Such all-consuming energy (symbol for Mars). 46. I have been smitten with the reek of Thy mouth, that drinketh neverwine but life. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap I, v.14: \"Even as evil kisses corruptthe blood, so do my words devour the spirit of man.\" 47. How the dew of the Universe whitens the lips! CF. Liber LXV, Cap I, v.59: \"Stained isthe purple of thy mouth, O brilliant one, with the white glory of the lips of Adonai.\" 48. Ah! trickling flow of the stars of the mother Supernal, begone! The Adept reaches even unto Kether... 49. I Am She that should come, the Virgin of all men. To be wedded to the god-head as his Shekinah. 50. I am a boy before Thee, O Thou satyr God. 51. Thou wilt inflict the punishment of pleasure--Now! Now! Now! "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"52. Io Pan! Io Pan! I love Thee. I love Thee. 53. O my God, spare me! 54. Now! It is done! Death. The last few verses have shown the Adept's throes of ecstasy in union with the Supernals. 55. I cried aloud the word --- and it was a mighty spell to bind theInvisible, an enchantment to unbind the bound; yea, to unbind the bound. The marriage of earth and heaven. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Chapter II (Attributed to the sacred planet Saturn) 1. O my God! use Thou me again, alway. For ever! For ever! The Prophet surrenders to the MT. 2. That which came fire from Thee cometh water from me; let therefore Thy Spirit lay hold on me, so that my right hand loose the lightning. Yesod. \"fire\" S. \"water\" M. \"Spirit\" A. Cf. 777, 31bis.: Fire does a double duty as spirit. And the hand of the Prophet is loosed upon the pages of these scriptures. 3. Travelling through space, I saw the onrush of two galaxies, butting each other and goring like bulls upon earth. I was afraid. 9 & 8. Are the Sephiroth that NEMO appends as comments to this verse? And how does this verse reflect any of the elemnnts of these two spheres? Are these the two 'galaxies' that butt each other? 4. Thus they ceased fight, and turned upon me, and I was sorely crushed and torn. Cf. 777, 32 bis.: Saturn does a double duty as earth. And so these opening verses conclude with the Prophet being uplifted; and beyond the limitations described in Liber LXV, Cap I, v.11: \"Nor is it fitting for the cobbler to prate of the Royal matter. O cobbler! Mend me this shoe, that I may walk. O king! If I be thy son, let us speak of the Embassy to the King thy Brother. 5. I had rather have been trampled by the World-Elephant. ÔÅó=Lead; Yesod; Ganesha. Ganesha is the Hindu god of prudence. The Prophet's hesitance and fear is described. 6. O my God! Thou art my little pet tortoise! An ancient model of the world had teh firmament resting atop a giant turtle. And the tortoise is attributed to Yesod. 7. Yet Thou sustainest the World-Elephant. The elephant is attributed to the 22nd path; the Lust Atu. 8. I creep under Thy carapace, like a lover into the bed of his beautiful; I creep in, and sit in Thine heart, as cubby and cosy as may be. An Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. 9. Thou shelterest me, that I hear not the trumpeting of that World-Elephant. And a rising beyond the earth plane. 10. Thou art not worth an obol in the agora; yet Thou art not to be boughtat the ransom of the whole Universe. And an invocation unto the highest; even the Ain Soph Aur. 11. Thou art like a beautiful Nubian slave leaning her naked purple againstthe green pillars of marble that are above the bath. Atu VXII--As above so below. Also Cf. LXV, Cap I, v.20: \"O my beautiful, I have likened thee to a jet Nubian slave, a boy of melancholy eyes.\" And LXV, Cap II, v.1: \"I passed into the mountain of lapis-lazuli, even as a green hawk between the pillars of turquoise that is seated upon the throne of the East. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"12. Wine jets from her black nipples. Atu VXII--The universe in equilibrium. 13. I drank wine awhile agone in the house of Pertinax. The cup-boy favoured me, and gave me of the right sweet Chian. Pertinax=stick to it. 14. There was a Doric boy, skilled in feats of strength, an athlete. The full moon fled away angrily down the wrack. Ah! but we laughed. Yesod. 15. I was pernicious drunk, O my God! Yet Pertinax brought me to the bridal. Perdurabo. 16. I had a crown of thorns for all my dower. Isaiah of the Torah develops a similar prophecy. 17. Thou art like a goat's horn from Astor, O Thou God of mine, gnarl'dand crook'd and devilish strong. Markhor. {A wild goat of Northwest India.} 18. Colder than all the ice of all the glaciers of the Naked Mountain wasthe wine it poured for me. Nanga Parbat. {An Himalayan mountain} 19. A wild country and a waning moon. Clouds scudding over the sky. A circuit of pines, and of tall yews beyond.Thou in the midst! More Yesod and [Ayin] house of [Saturn]. This comment by NEMO confuses me. The Devil Atu is an intimation of the mastery of the earth plane and leads to Tiphareth. 20. O all ye toads and cats, rejoice! Ye slimy things, come hither! The toad is attributed to Yesod, as is the elephant and tortoise. The cat is attriubted to the Moon Atu. 21. Dance, dance to the Lord our God! The dance of Shiva. Or even better: Reguli and an invocation unto the Supernals. 22. He is he! He is he! He is he! 'I am that I am'--ARARITA. 23. Why should I go on? Cf. Liber AL vel Legis, Cap. II, vs. 73 & 74: \"Ah! Ah! Death! Death! Thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man, unto thee. The length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. He that lives long & desires death much is ever the King among the Kings.\" 24. Why? Why? comes the sudden cackle of a million imps of hell. ? "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"25. And the laughter runs. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. II, vs. 20-24: \"A little crazy boy that rode with me spake unto the swan, and said: Who art thou that dost float and fly and dive and soar in the inane? Behold, these many aeons have passed; whence camest thou? Whither wilt thou go? And laughing I chid him, saying: No whence! No whither! The swan being silent, he answered: Then, if with no goal, why this eternal journey? And I laid my head against the Head of the Swan, and laughed, saying: Is there not joy ineffable in this aimless winging? Is there not weariness and impatience for who would attain to some goal?\" 26. But sickens not the Universe; but shakes not the stars. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. II, v.12: \"Also it came to pass, that thereby she sickened, and corrupted before me. Almost I cast myself into the stream. 27. God! how I love Thee! 28. I am walking in an asylum; all the men and women about me are insane. [Saturn] melancholy. For the Neophyte, the study of one's chosen chapter of this book represents one's voice of the Khabs as painted with the sorrow of the Great Mother. 29. Oh madness! madness! madness! desirable art thou! The rites of Bacchus. 30. But I love Thee, O God! 31. These men and women rave and howl; they froth out folly. And Dionysis. 32. I begin to be afraid. I have no check; I am alone. Alone. Alone. Cf. Liber AL vel Legis, Cap. II, v.23: \"I am alone: there is no God where I am.\" Along with vs. 46-47: \"Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart? Where I am these are not.\" 33. Think, O God, how I am happy in Thy love. 34. O marble Pan! O false leering face! I love Thy dark kisses, bloodyand stinking! O marble Pan! Thy kisses are like sunlight on the blueAEgean; their blood is the blood of the sunset over Athens; their stink islike a garden of Roses of Macedonia. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. I, v.23: \"Not aloud shall they praise thee; but in the night watch one shall steal close, and grip thee with the secret grip; another shall privily cast a crown of violets over thee; a third shall greatly dare, and press mad lips to thine.\" 35. I dreamt of sunset and roses and vines; Thou wast there, O my God, Thoudidst habit Thyself as an Athenian courtesan, and I loved Thee. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. I, v.26-27: \"Now I am with thee; I will never leave thy being. For I am the soft sinuous one entwined about thee, heart of gold!\" 36. Thou art no dream, O Thou too beautiful alike for sleep and waking! 37. I disperse the insane folk of the earth; I walk alone with my littlepuppets in the garden. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. I, v.36-38: \"(From a certain world cam an infinite wail.) That falling petal seemed to the little ones a wave to engulph their continent. So they will reproach thy servant saying: Who hath set thee to save us? He will be sore distressed.\" 38. I am Gargantuan great; yon galaxy is but the smoke-ring of mineincense. Ring of [Saturn]."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 39. Burn Thou strange herbs, O God! 40. Brew me a magic liquor, boys, with your glances! For this and the previous verse, Cf. Liber AL vel Legis, Cap. I, v.63: \"Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you!\" 41. The very soul is drunken. Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. I, v.64: \"Intoxicate the inmost, O my lover, not the outermost!\" 42. Thou art drunken, O my God, upon my kisses. And I am reminded of part of Liber Legis, Cap. I, v.61: \"...I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you...\" 43. The Universe reels; Thou hast looked upon it. Atu X. 44. Twice, and all is done. 45. Come, O my God, and let us embrace! Cf. Liber LXV, Cap. II, v.5: \"I suffered the deadly embrace of the Snake and of the Goat; I paid the infernal homage ot the shame of Khem.\" It is even interesting to note that the goat is a symbol attributed to Capricorn and its ruler: Saturn. 46. Lazily, hungrily, ardently, patiently; so will I work. The virtues and vices of the gnomes. 47. There shall be an End. An intimation of the deliminating quality of Saturn. 48. O God! O God! 49. I am a fool to love Thee; Thou art cruel, Thou withholdest Thyself. A potent symbol for the dark night of the soul. Christ on the cross also felt this when he called out: 'My god! My god! Why has thou forsaken me?' 50. Come to me now! I love Thee! I love Thee! 51. O my darling, my darling --- Kiss me! Kiss me! Ah! but again. 52. Sleep, take me! Death, take me! This life is too full; it pains, it slays, it suffices. The weight of Saturn. 53. Let me go back into the world; yea, back into the world. And the Prophet is wearied from the weight of Saturn.

The pathof the Star Atu leading from Tiphareth ot Chokmah. 3. God! how I ran out in my rage and scattered the chorus! The frenetic energy of the Rites of Bacchus. 4. But in my temple stood Bacchus as the priest of Ammon-Ra. The Adeptus Exemptus. 5. Therefore I went wildly with the girls into Abyssinia; and there we abode and rejoiced. This is the starry Duant beyond the Abyss. 6. Exceedingly; yea, in good sooth! 7. I will eat the ripe and the unripe fruit for the glory of Bacchus. The orgiastic eucharist; the consummation of virgin and the whore; the mother and the daughter. 8. Terraces of ilex, and tiers of onyx and opal and sardonyx leading up tothe cool green porch of malachite. Ilex is the evergreen oak. Onyx is attributed to the 32nd path (Saturn). Opal is attributed to both the 8th and 12th paths (Mercury). Sardonyx is a striped onyx composed of Sard and Charledony. Malachite is a mineral consisting of concentric layers with a fibrous structure; used in making ornamental articles. 9. Within is a crystal shell, shaped like an oyster --- O glory of Priapus! O beatitude of the Great Goddess! Cf. My comment ot v.7 of this chapter and the third chapter of the Book of Lies...The oyster is a symbol of the Yoni. And the brothers of the A.'.A.'. are one with the mother of the child as they cause all men to worship her. 10. Therein is a pearl. This is the dissolution in the alembic of coitus. 11. O Pearl! thou hast come from the majesty of dread Ammon-Ra. Humanity is raised to royalty by the eugenic process of transformation. 12. Then I the priest beheld a steady glitter in the heart of the pearl. The seed of the Logos. 13. So bright we could not look! But behold! a blood-red rose upon a roodof glowing gold! 14. So I adored the God. Bacchus! thou art the lover of my God! 15.

Or is this a form a-sexuality as per v. 24-25 of this chapter? Or both? 17. Thou shalt have a lover among the lords of the grey land. That lover is Babalon, the guardian against the dispersion of the Abyss. 18. This shall he bring unto thee, without which all is in vain; a man'slife spilt for thy love upon My Altars.

Ithuriel is an angel in Milton's Paradise Lost who restored Satan to his proper shape. 28. So did they, and the archangels swept over the heaven. As unto Satan, the angels claimed their divinity and hence become our highest Aspiration. 29.

Thou art He, O God! O my darling! my child! my plaything! Thou art like a cluster of maidens, like a multitude of swans upon the lake.

Fasten the fangs of the hound Eternity in this my throat! With the darkness of the Sea of Binah comes silence; Abrahadabra. 9. I am like a wounded bird flapping in circles. This is the ordeal of the Abyss. 10. Who knows where I shall fall? And this is the confusion of the Abyss. For knowledge is confusion as per Liber AL vel Legis, Cap.

He shall fall down into the pit called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.\" 11. O blessed One! O God! O my devourer! And this is the formula of the Abyss; the casting off of all that one has and is.

Let me fall, fall down, fall away, afar, alone! And this is the momentum of the Abyss as provided by one's Holy Guardian Angel. 13. Let me fall! And this is the yearning unto Nuit. 14. Nor is there any rest, Sweet Heart, save in the cradle of royal Bacchus, the thigh of the most Holy One. And this is the comfort provided by one's Holy Guardian Angel in the Abyss. 15.

Tutulu! as it is written in the ancient book. {Osiris.} One star in a company of stars; Hadit in Nuit; Khabs in the Khu. Also we are given three magickal words of power through the Prophet. 7. Three words of that book are as life to a new aeon; no god has read the whole. 8. But thou and I, O God, have written it page by page. These three words of power and their utterance continuously repeated will invoke and shape the character of the new aeon. 9. Ours is the elevenfold reading of the Elevenfold word. Abrahadabra. How is this word 'read'? 10. These seven letters together make seven diverse words; each word is divine, and seven sentences are hidden therein. \"seven letters\" i.e., these 7 chapters. Are the chapters of this book seven specific lessons? And are there seven 'sub-lessons'? 11. Thou art the Word, O my darling, my lord, my master! The three planes of devotion to the 'other' (Nuit): as lover (darling); as a god (lord); and as the Holy Guardian Angel (master). 12. O come to me, mix the fire and the water, all shall dissolve. And the Alchemical process that consummates the relationship of the 'I' to the 'Not-I' (other). "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"13. I await Thee in sleeping, in waking. I invoke Thee no more; for Thou art in me, O Thou who hast made me a beautiful instrument tuned to Thy rapture. And this is the longing and the Aspiration. 14. Yet art Thou ever apart, even as I. In Liber AL vel Legis, Nuit says: \"For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.\" The overcoming of division is the 'dreadful issue' and the 'strife' as mentioned in the next verse. This verse seems like an hesitation before battle; much in the same way Arjuna knelt before Krishna immediately prior to the battle of Kuruksetra. 15. I remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the year, in the dusk ofthe Equinox of Osiris, when first I beheld Thee visibly; when first the dreadful issue was fought out; when the Ibis-headed One charmed away the strife. Nov. 18, 1898. This date is Crowley's introduction to Cecil Jones, the Golden Dawn, and MacGregor Mathers. 16. I remember Thy first kiss, even as a maiden should. Nor in the dark byways was there another: Thy kisses abide. The smattering of this illusion is the overcoming of the lie of innocence. 17. There is none other beside Thee in the whole Universe of Love. A vision of the Universe from the perspective of Union and the resulting adoration from the throes of that union. 18. My God, I love Thee, O Thou goat with gilded horns! ÔÅä. 19. Thou beautiful bull of Apis! Thou beautiful serpent of Apep! Thou beautiful child of the Pregnant Goddess! Apis literally means 'hidden' and is a bull that ancient Egyptians worshipped due to its connection with the god Ptah (equivalent to Kether). Apep was the personification of darkness and evil; a serpent god who was overthrown by Ra with the risinig of the sun. Are these not the I/Not-I archetypes of whose conjunction births the Universe? 20. Thou hast stirred in Thy sleep, O ancient sorrow of years! Thou hastraised Thine head to strike, and all is dissolved into the Abyss of Glory. Kundalini. And is this not a description of that union? 21. An end to the letters of the words! An end to the sevenfold speech. And yet it is so beyond description; even I can see that. 22. Resolve me the wonder of it all into the figure of a gaunt swift camel striding over the sand. G Still this is a key to crossing the Abyss. 23. Lonely is he, and abominable; yet hath he gained the crown. For G goes to rtk. O the agony and the joy of it all! As it must be. 24. Oh rejoice! rejoice! 25. My God! O my God! I am but a speck in the star-dust of ages; I am the Master of the Secret of Things. A star in a company of stars; successful in its orbit; the attainment of Nuit."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 26. I am the Revealer and the Preparer. Mine is the Sword--and the Mitre and the Winged Wand! {Hie reus, Hegemon, Hierophant.} The fact that the initial letter o the spelling of the names of these three officers begins with the Letter 'H' and signifies life as the character \"is one mode of representing the ancient Greek aspirate; Breathing and Breath, are the evidence of life.\" (from the Golden Dawn Neophyte Ceremony) The Hiereus is the mighty, avenging guardian of the sacred mysteries; placed at the lowest point of Malkuth; enthroned upon matter as well as the borders of the Qliphoth. To her is the sword as she is the Shekinnah. The Hegemon is the reconciler between light and darkness and represents the higher aspirations of the soul; his ensign is the mitre-headed scepter. The Hierophant is the Lord of hte Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts, his ensign is the Winged Wand. Yet does this verse also speak to a foreshadowing of prophecy? 27. I am the Initiator and the Destroyer. Mine is the Globe --- and the Bennu bird and the Lotus of Isis my daughter! [26-27.] {Wands of the Adepts in 5=6.} The Prophet having prepared the vessel is then filled with illumination; the god speaks from this vehicle. 28. I am the One beyond these all; and I bear the symbols of the mighty darkness. Binah. And the prophecy is given. 29. There shall be a sigil as of a vast black brooding ocean of death and the central blaze of darkness, radiating its night upon all. ‚äó. This sigil is described in this verse. Also is this highly devotional prophecy all consuming as per Liber LXV, Cap. I, vs. 16: \"As an acid eats into steel, as a cancer that utterly corrupts the body; so am I unto the spirit of man.\" Yet that refers to a different plane. 30. It shall swallow up that lesser darkness. The lesser darkness is the restriction of mortal limitation. God-hood is confirmed by its consumption. 31. But in that profound who shall answer: What is? In such a state of being there seems to the lower being a confusion. 32. Not I. NEMO. 33. Not Thou, O God! Verses 32 and 33 may allude to Liber Legis, Cap I, vs. 21: \"With the God & the Adorer I am nothing: They do not see me. They are as upon the earth; I am Heaven, and there is no other God than me, and my lord Hadit.\" 34. Come, let us no more reason together; let us enjoy! Let us be ourselves, silent, unique, apart. \"no more reason together\"--above Ruach. This is the peace unutterable, rest and ecstasy that Nuit promises in Liber AL vel Legis. 35. O lonely woods of the world! In what recesses will ye hide our love? The hair of Nuit! All these Phalluses and their vaginal hiding! "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 36. The forest of the spears of the Most High is called Night, and Hades, and the Day of Wrath; but I am His captain, and I bear His cup. 4th and 11th Aethyrs. The fourth aethyr concerns the Magus and the marriage of Chaos with the purified Virgin. The symbols of this verse are the night of Pan; the Chariot Atu and the Cup of Babalon. 37. Fear me not with my spearmen! They shall slay the demons with their petty prongs. Ye shall be free. Restriction is mastered with the courageous bon-vivance that comes in the heat of passion. 38. Ah, slaves! ye will not--ye know not how to will. The lower self remains confounded. 39. Yet the music of my spears shall be a song of freedom. It is an inspiration that results from the passion that pushes us onward in the spite of the lower self. 40. A great bird shall sweep from the abyss of Joy, and bear ye away to be my cup-bearers. This seems to allude to Liber LXV, Cap. II, vs. 17: \"Also the Holy One came upon me, and I beheld a white swan floating in the blue.\" But again, this is of a different plane. 41. Come, O my God, in one last rapture let us attain to the Union with the Many! [41-44.] See expl[anation] in Aethyrs. The union of the one (Hadit) with the many (Nuit). 42. In the silence of Things, in the Night of Forces, beyond the accursed domain of the Three, let us enjoy our love! The Ain Soph Aur is the greater silence and night of forces beyond the Supernal Triad and is the abode of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. This is the yew-groves of Yama referred to in LXV, Cap I, vs. 39. 43. My darling! My darling! away, away beyond the Assembly and the Law and the Enlightenment unto an Anarchy of solitude and Darkness! Again, beyond the Supernals! 44. For even thus must we veil the brilliance of our Self. And so is the L.V.X. within the N.O.X. 45. My darling! My darling! Pure rapture. 46. O my God, but the love in Me bursts over the bonds of Space and Time; my love is spilt among them that love not love. [46-47.] The spirit flashing down from NEMO. 47. My wine is poured out for them that never tasted wine. 48. The fumes thereof shall intoxicate them and the vigour of my love shall breed mighty children from their maidens. This is the divine intoxication of the innermost spoken of at the end of the first chapter of Liber LXV and breeds the power of prophecy. It is moreover, a description of the force of love that is beyond love and how that force generates the logos. 49. Yea! without draught, without embrace:--and the Voice answered Yea! These things shall be. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 50. Then I sought a Word for Myself; nay, for myself. [50-52.] Perdurabo speaks. Was this the logos? 51. And the Word came: O Thou! it is well. Heed naught! I love Thee! I love Thee! And is that the elevenfold word: Abrahadabra? 52. Therefore had I faith unto the end of all; yea, unto the end of all. Faith in the absolute despite the self. Without this, these great runes will be misunderstood and we will fall into megalomania and erotomania; the pit of reason in a culture of knowledge only for the sake of knowledge. {The text book of a Master of the Temple.}"}]
