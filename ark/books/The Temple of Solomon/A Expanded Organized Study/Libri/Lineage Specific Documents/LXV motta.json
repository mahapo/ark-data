I was given a signed,luxury copy of this book which I cherish, study and meditate upon to presentday.I am now giving the main body of this volume to the world for studyknowing that anything else within the contents of this Equinox can be publishedby others if they want to read the book reviews, announcements and other itemsthat include other than the commentaries themselves. I have decided thesecommentaries have remained dormant too long as a consequence of the moralinsanity and neglect of those failures who were named voters in the Declarationof Trust, given copyrights and failed completely to make this volume and otheravailable to the public as my Superior would of wished.I therefore give what should be studied, knowing what I give is what was,and still is the main concentration of my studies, the actual commentariesthemselves. One vital point that my Superior made so many years ago. Thateach Adept is going to develop coordinates from Liber LXV depending on theidiosyncrasies of the karma of the star.This has proven correct; and on many occasions of sublime and deepmeditation my insights have taken directions that have developed a completelyunique school of thought based on my particular initiations. Yet, without mySuperior's interpretations they could not of advanced in the direction they did.Therefore, bear this in mind; and study carefully these commentaries forthey will surely unlock that insight within the sincere aspirant; as it has over theyears with me.Love is the law, love under willINTRODUCTIONDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Several years ago we were talking to a gentleman who, at least at the time, hatedΘελημα and Aleister Crowley bitterly, and he told us: “I have done all the practicescounseled by the A∴ A∴, and I have never achieved a single solitary result.”At the time we were younger and more credulous, so it did not occur to us that hewas probably lying. We asked, very much concerned: “But did you ever sign the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Oath and Pledge of a Probabtioner?”“No,” he shook his head, “I never did.”We were relieved. “In that case, you couldn’t expect any results. You didn’t formthe Magickal Link with the Order. It is the transmission of the Wand, you know.”The gentleman, who belonged to a group of mystics who practice homosexuality,smiled at my unintentional pun.Although I have not seen this gentleman for many years, nor would I look forwardto meeting him again, he and his group have continued creating whatever interferencethey can with the work of the A∴ A∴ since that time. Slander on this plane, piratedpublications of Our works, instigation of egoic indiscipline in Aspirants — all this ispart of their routine. Of course, they make the Ordeals harder, which is quite alright.It is to people like them that LXV iv 11­16 refers.In parody of that gentleman, I am bound to say that I have not done all thepractices counseled by the A∴ A∴!Of, course, I bound myself, from the beginnning, by the Oath and the Pledge, to atrue Brother of the A∴ A∴, the late Frater SATURNUS, 8° = 3□ A∴ A∴.But although I had deep instruction from Frater SATURNUS, and once in a whiledirect magickal communication with Him, he always insisted the he was not myHierophant in the A∴ A∴; that to all those whose Aspiration is true and strong, aspiritual Hierophant is asssigned, and this Entity handles all the details of theAspirant’s progress.This spiritual Hierophant is, and is at the same time is not necessarily, theAspirant’s Holy Guardian Angel.But whenever the Trances of the Central Pillar are reached, the Spiritual Beingmanifesting itself is the Holy Guardian Angel.Who is the Holy Guardian Angel?That is what LXV tries to explain. The intelligent student soon realizes that nothingas naive as the old lore of good and evil geniuses can be meant here.Nor is the H.G.A. a manifestation of some idiotic Mahatma of the Theosophists.Not that Mahatmas do not exist; they exist. I am one myself, But I am not a HolyGuardian Angel.Let us put it this way: I am not yet grown up enough to be able to be that.The H.G.A. is not a Buddhi­Manas Image of your holy GURU, either. Beingscapable of functioning as H.G.A. are beyond Atman altogether.Are they human? That depends on your definition of humanity.Were they a product of the same evolution as ours? I do not know. But at the levelat which they exist, such questions are academic.Is the H.G.A. of the A∴ A∴ always the same?Yes and no. No, because the Central Task of the Inner Order is to achieve theKnowledge and Conversation, and once this is achieved the Adepti have a free"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"choice of whether they want to continue in the Discipline of the A∴ A∴ or not. Noone knows the name of the God of his brother, or sister, as the case may be. Thus didFrater Iehi Aour leave the A∴ A∴ to follow the Way of the Buddha on reachingAdeptship.And yet, I who speak to you would say yes. Because to those who continue in theA∴ A∴ after reaching the Knowledge and Conversation comes, little by little,understanding of the Spiritual Nature of that Black Star that shields itself in horrorbecause it cannot abide the touch of fear; wears a mask of utter sorrow because itwills to be known only by those who can know true joy; who was inveigled,slandered, cursed, feared and hated by the lords of the slums of the dead aeon underthe name of the Devil.Yes, we are followers of the Fallen One. Verily, does not that Somber Star pointdownward through the Abyss?Read then, who will. And let them who seek knock; for it shall be opened unto ye.Love is the law, love under will.EDITORIAL NOTEThe original text of the Holy Book is written in boldface. The Commentaries byFrater O.M. (Aleister Crowley) are in common type. The commentaries by Frater A.(Marcelo Motta) are in italics.The original text is, of course, in Class A. The Commentaries by Frater O.M. are inClass B. The commentaries by Frater A. are in Class C.The Author of the Holy Book is, of course V.V.V.V.V., Master of the Temple ofthe A∴ A∴. It is useless to speculate on His relationship to Aleister Crowley. Ratherwork to become Masters of the Temple yourselves, and you will understand.Let the reader by warned that although, for reasons of style, the male pronoun isused for the Candidate in most of these Commentaries, the A∴ A∴ accepts both menand women, and information valuable to one sex is just as valuable to the other.CHAPTER IThe five chapters refer to the five Elements. 1­Earth, 2­Air, 3­Water, 4­Fire, and 5­Spirit. Each shows its Element in the light of the relation between the Adeptus Minorand his Holy Guardian Angel. Thus in Chapter I the material world or sensible aspect"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of Nature is shown to be a mere symbolic picture of something altogether different.Of course the elements below Spirit are considered from the point of view of Spirit,since Akasha is the Center, or harmonization, of the lower Elements. Also, thepresentations given by O.M. in his commentaries are not as universal in scope as theimages in the original: they represent a limitation, the point of view of one Adept,only. The Commentaries are therefore useful as referentials, but candidates muststrive to build their own frames of coordinates, which can safely be done only fromthe verses themselves.Why, then, write Commentaries at all? There are many reasons. One of them, notthe least, is that Religion should be a Science as well as an Art. Sciences needmeasurement, which depends on fullness of data. The more landmarks available, theeasier to build frames, and eventually measurement will become possible. Then, ofcourse, LXV will become obsolete as a religious manual. But by that time its Author,or His disciples, will be ready to produce another just beyond the reach ofmeasurement. Or if not they, someone else.1. I am the Heart; and the Snake is entwinedAbout the invisible core of the mind.Rise, O my snake! It is now is the hourOf the hooded and holy ineffable flower.Rise, O my snake, into brilliance of bloomOn the corpse of Osiris afloat in the tomb!O heart of my mother, my sister, mine own,Thou art given to Nile, to the terror Typhon!Ah me! but the glory of ravening stormEnswathes thee and wraps thee in frenzy of form.Be still, O my soul! that the spell may dissolveAs the wands are upraised, and the aeons revolve.Behold! in my beauty how joyous Thou art,O Snake that caresses the crown of mine heart!Behold! we are one, and the tempest of yearsGoes down to the dusk, and the Beetle appears.O Beetle! the drone of Thy dolorous noteBe ever the trance of this tremulous throat!I await the awaking!

He ceases: and enters the midnight silence where he adores Khephra. Then heawaits the coming of his Lord.2. Adonai spake unto V.V.V.V.V., saying: There must ever be division in theword.3. For the colours are many, but the light is one."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4. Therefore thou writest that which is of mother of emerald, and of lapis­lazuli,and of turquoise, and of alexandrite.5. Another writeth the words of topaz, and of deep amethyst, and of graysapphire, and of deep sapphire with a tinge as of blood.6. Therefore do ye fret yourselves because of this.7. Be not contented with the image.8. I who am the Image of an Image say this.9. Debate not of the image, saying Beyond! Beyond! One mounteth unto theCrown by the moon and by the Sun, and by the arrow, and by the Foundation,and by the dark home of the stars from the black earth.10. Not otherwise may ye reach unto the Smooth Point.11. Nor is it fitting for the cobbler to prate of the Royal matter. O cobbler! mendme this shoe, that I may walk. O king! if I be thy son, let us speak of theEmbassy to the King thy Brother.The Angel says: Each men sees Nature in his own particular way. What he sees isonly an image. All images must be ignored; the adept must aspire single­heatedly tothe Smooth Point. This matter cannot be discussed in common language; the kingmust speak of kingly things in a kingly way.The references to precious stones should be understood in the light of qabalisticcorrespondences, but also, particularly, in the light of the Third Great Ordealmentioned in AL iii 66. If two men visit a country and then write a description of it,their descriptions will differ in what their normal idiosyncrasies differ, not matterhow general be their intention to make their descriptions. In talking about realms aslittle treaded as those of the subtler Sheaths of the Self, the almost total absence ofgeneral experience in the matter makes small differences in description moreconfusing, not only to the listeners but to the describer himself, than they shouldnormally be.In practice, what happens is that an Adept may be serenely minding his ownbusiness, and expounding his own system of achievement, and being successful inbringing other men to self­realization through his system, and suddenly he isconfronted with what appears to be a totally different set of symbols and plan oftraining which, nevertheless, he feels to be a least as valid as his own. This ‘feeling’is of course simply his spiritual perception at work. But his Lower Manas does notshare this spiritual perception (except in rarest cases) in its fullness, and worries. TheLower Manas is the “cobbler” whose function is merely to mend the shoe (rememberthe sandal­strap in the hand of the Egyptian god, signifying the power of Akasha, thepower of Going) so that the higher faculties may walk (he is elsewhere mentioned inthis Holy Book as the ‘scribe’, but the cobbler is a more complex concept. The"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"‘scribe’ is merely the Lower Manas, but he ‘cobbler’ is the complex Lower Manas +Kama + Prana + Linga Sharira + Sthula Sharira considered as the total ‘normalman’. Of course, in the case of an Adept, however, this ‘normal man’ is initiate, andwill have greater control of his vehicles, and a greater infusion in them of spiritualprinciples, than is the true norm of profane mankind).No matter what differences in approach there may be among legitimate Schools ifInitiation (there are false schools, and there are schools which are not false, but areso fragmentary in their training that it becomes impossible to call them legitimate),the human race is so constituted that it can only reach Integration, that is, Initiation,by the equilibrating Trances of the Middle Path of the Qabalah. These experiencesare, therefore, the crucial ones (if you will pardon the pun). Provided the system inquestion includes them in one form or another, the system is all right.Of course, other lines of evolution may be differently constituted. They all have incommon the Smooth Point, however, or so at least the Angel seems to intimate.Often ill­trained, or greenhorn Adepts (those who are reaching Tiphereth for thefirst time in one particular incarnation, and never reached it before, and thereforehave no Magickal Memory­the so­called Intuition­to help them), will becomedisturbed when making contact with another system which may seem to differ wildlyfrom their own (sometimes as if it were it complete opposite), and which yet they feel,rightly, to be true. In such cases it is fatal to leave your system and tackle the other. Itis mixing the planes. If there be a need of contact between your branch of activity andthat other, this contact should be made on the plane of Buddhi­Manas, and not onany lower plane. It is the “king’s son”, that is, the Prince, that is, the Tiphereth­consciousness, that should handle the “Embassy” to the other King involved. The“cobbler” must be made to do his work, that is to keep the lower vehicles in goodhealth and disciplined to the Call of the Highest.There is naturally, and exception to the rule of not going into the details of anothersystem: when you are trying to perfect a new system that should include the bestpoints of two­or more­others. Normally, however, the Impulse will be known, in thiscase, to come from the Prince­from Tiphereth. Do what thou wilt shall be the wholeof the Law.12. Then was there silence. Speech had done with us awhile. There is a light sostrenuous that it is not perceived as light.Silence. The Adept reports his impressions. (a) The highest degree of any givenkind of energy surpasses the receptive power of the observer. This it appears as if ofsome other order.13. Wolf’s bane is not so sharp as steel; yet it pierceth the body more subtly.The subtler the form of energy, the more potent, but it is less easily observed.The use of poisons and weapons as symbols indicates that the first result of theimpact of higher energy in lower vehicles is, apparently at least, destructive. The"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"charge produces a stepping­up in existing rates of vibration, with consequentexpansion and agitation of all psychosomatic processes. The purely physicalphenomena subside quickly because the human body, materially speaking, is thehighest developed vehicle that we possess, normally, at this stage of evolution.Emotionally we are also much better developed than mentally, so the ecstasiesconnected with the Trances are easily absorbed within a few days, at the most. Butsince our Manas is our most recently developed Sheath, mental disturbance may lastfor quite longer and, in some cases, may become irreversible. In short, we may goinsane as a result of Trance. Many have. This explains fanaticism, and religiouspersecution, throughout the history of mankind, but it also explains the excesses ofrevolutionaries and of conquering armies everywhere. Forget not, either, thebickering of scientists confronted with a new fact that fails to fit in with tier pettheories, or the existing concept of the Universe.14. Even as evil kisses corrupt the blood, so do my words devour the spirit ofman.Truth destroys the reason.It is not quite correct to say that truth destroys reason. The impact of a new datumupon one’s existing concept of the Universe destroys the nice house of cards whichwe had built, and may cause anguish, mental perturbation, and so forth. But reasonis nothing but the faculty of integrating data, and if the mind withstands the shock itsoon starts the process of building a new frame of reference which should include thenew fact introduced into our consciousness.Reason, in the sense decried in Liber AL, indicates a mental structure whichmakes of this organic integrator of ours the core and source of our consciousness.This kind of insanity is not as difficult to occur as it seems, if your consider that theinfusion of spiritual levels of energy in the Lower Manas may mislead a carelessthinker into believing that he is functioning in Buddhi Manas when he is merelywallowing in an over­energized Lower Manas. The qabalists indicate this possibilityof error by englobing both Lower Manas and Buddhi Manas in their concept of theRuach. As long as Daath remains fluid, ever­changing, ever­integrating, evertransmitting and receiving, there is no danger. The minute it becomes static andremains so, there is danger, no matter how beautiful the crystal may be. No staticview of the Universe, no matter how ample and how glorious, can be valid. For theUniverse is a living thing, and is continually changing.15. I breathe, and there is infinite dis­ease in the spirit.Life disturbs the placidity of the mind’s acceptance of dead symbols as reality.16. As an acid eats into steel, as a cancer that utterly corrupts the body; so am Iunto the spirit of man.The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel gives a new and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"higher form of energy which destroys the grosser types of existence.17. I shall not rest until I have dissolved it all.The process continues until complete.18. So also the light that is absorbed. One absorbs little, and is called white andglistening; one absorbs all and is called black.Phenomena result from resistance to “love.” Perfect union is silent.In one very important sense A.C. means here that the more dramatic andcatastrophic a samadhi is, the less perfect it is. True union is unconscious, effortless;to put it in Taoist language, it is the Way of the Tao. A very noticeable samadhi isindication that the parapsychosoma involved is not familiar with the higher plane ofexistence from which the energy is being instilled. As is gradually adjusts to its newlevel of existence the samadhi becomes less intense and eventually seems todisappear completely. The Lower Manas frequently becomes disturbed right then:‘Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani?’ But what actually happened is that the Angel’s energywent “underground”­that is, penetrated the subconscious. Only then can you reallysay that a particular Trance has been conquered. If the Lower Manas takes thetrouble to analyze behavior, day by day, it will soon realize that the total man nolonger reacts to the same stimuli as it used to in the past. An initiation into a newattitude toward life has been undergone.In another, and equally important sense, the verse warns clairvoyants against avery common mistake: That of thinking that a shiny aura necessarily indicatesspiritual advancement. This depends on the highest plane at which the clairvoyant issensitive. Energy impinging from the plane immediately above may quite simplyappear “black” to the inner eye. Since clairvoyants seldom have any sense ofperspective­or ego control, if you prefer­they seldom discount their own limitations asobservers. Hence, for instance, ‘Bishop’ Leadbeater’s glowing descriptions of theauras of ‘mahatmas’.Still another important sense, also useful to clairvoyants, is when you are (asoccasionally happens) witness to an initiation from the inner planes. The moreperfectly the initiate is able to make contact with the spiritual force involved, the lesshis aura will shine. In the best instances, at the crowning moment of the initiation theinitiate becomes invisible to other eyes. It is as if he had become enveloped in a cloudof total darkness. You do not even ‘feel’ his presence anymore.19. Therefore, O my darling, art thou black.20. O my beautiful, I have likened thee to a jet Nubian slave, a boy ofmelancholy eyes.21. O the filthy one! the dog! they cry against thee. Because thou art mybeloved."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"19­21. V.V.V.V.V. being perfectly Adeptus Minor appears evil.The problem is the same as with those clairvoyants mentioned above. When theysee a ‘black’ aura, it does not occur to them that maybe radiation is occurringbeyond their level of perception. To do so would be humiliating to them, since itwould admit an implicit inferiority. The sensitive capable of such an admission wouldbe well on the way of transcending his then limitations and of passing into a higherlevel of being.The subconscious antagonism is very real, and lower initiates, as a rule, resentand fear the Adept. They are incapable of understanding, for instance, how a mancan be sublime enough to produce, say, the Renaissance, and at the same time grossenough to want to fuck their wives (if you point out to them that this desire is a simplecorroboration of their good taste in wives, therefore a compliment, they don’t getmollified). We have­thank the Adepts!­become tolerant enough, the great majority ofus, to live with our little penises. But we still get incensed at the bigger penises of ourneighbors. Fear and hatred in the Ruach result from a psychological perception ofpersonal inferiority. Of course, this inferiority is illusory, and would be dispelled byAdepthood. But often the man sulks foolishly, stamps his foot, and refuses to becomean Adept. In such cases the initiator has no alternative but to strike hard and low,and to hell with them, master!22. Happy are they that praise thee; for they see thee with Mine eyes.Those who understand all this Work praise V.V.V.V.V.Those who praise an Adept, instead of condemning and persecuting him, havereached an equivalent level of insight. They see from the perspective Tiphereth, notfrom any lower perspective.23. Not aloud shall they praise thee; but in the night watch one shall steal close,and grip thee with the secret grip; another shall privily cast a crown of violetsover thee; a third shall greatly dare, and press mad lips to thine.24. Yea! the night shall cover all, the night shall cover all.23­24. They do so in secret ways.The reason for the secrecy is simple. The Inner College of the A∴ A∴ has a muchstronger influx from the Supernals than the Outer College, necessarily. Therefore itsMagickal Energy is most intense. Yet, for all its sublimity, the Inner College is belowthe Abyss, and subject to the laws of Duality and Glamour. The so­called “blackBrothers” and their currents are therefore easily attracted by any demonstration ofthe Inner College’s energy, and interference is intense here­more intense than at thelower levels.Silence and secrecy are therefore of the essence. The ancient so­called“Rosicrucians” had one single solitary rule for the outer world: they were not to beknown as “Rosicrucians”. Likewise, a prudent Adept will veil his energy and his"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"works with the utmost secrecy. As far as possible he will keep his operations subrosa­if you will pardon the pun.It is not possible to escape interference altogether, since you have crossed that Veilon one side of which is written ‘No Separate Existence’ and on the other side ofwhich is written ‘No Existence’. The very fact that you are alive, radiating, is enoughof a provocation to the “Black Brothers”. If, however, you can keep them fromidentifying the flesh from which your are working, and best of all, if you can keepthem from perceiving what you are trying to do, you will reduce most of theirinterference to a negligible level.Thus in A.C.’s novel Moonchild a magickal operation is conducted on two levelsat once, but only one level is meant to attract the attention of the opposition and does;therefore the other level accomplishes its purpose without interference.Normally, magickal operations are not conducted in such a way. Interference withany kind of operation, however, is very common. There are here several factorsapparently complex, but ultimately very simple, which hinge on the nature of thatgreat ‘devil’ Choronzon of which all “Black Brothers” are mere instruments.Crown of violets­the violet is purple, a Thelemically important color, and growsbest in hidden places, under cover of other plants.Much of the symbolism of LXV is homosexual. This perhaps due to the sex of theWriter’s body, since the Marriage that takes place in Tiphereth is that of the soul as abride to its god. Be that soul incarnated as a male or a female at the time, its formulais feminine in the Operation. Feminine reactions and attitudes are more naturallyexpressed if the body occupied at the time is female; but for some kinds of Orgia, insuch cases, other difficulties arise. In the case of the Magus of an Aeon, for instance,the work could hardly be done without the possession of the physical image of theCreative Power.25. Thou wast long seeking Me; thou didst run forward so fast that I wasunable to come up with thee. O thou darling fool! what bitterness thou didstcrown thy days withal.Perdurabo hindered his own success by over eagerness.A virtue not very common among Adepts, who usually feat the Angel at least asmuch as they aspire to Him, and therefore dance like crabs along the way. ButPerdurabo has always been an exceptional Star.26. Now I am with thee; I will never leave thy being.27. For I am the soft sinuous one entwined about thee, heart of gold!26­27. Union once made is permanent.28. My head is jewelled with twelve stars; My body is white as milk of the stars;it is bright with the blue of the abyss of stars invisible."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Angel is crowned with the Zodiac. His body is that of Nuit.In this verse it is emphasized that the Spiritual Being mentioned as “Angel” here isin reality above all the so­called Angelic hierarchies in depth of perspective. We arenot dealing with a planetary, or even with a starry nature. The Angel cannot beconnected with a particular Sign of the Zodiac, as human beings can. No: his natureis cosmic. He is identified with our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; but it is pointed outthat his power is somehow connected with our Sun, since the Zodiac exists only fromthe point of view of Sol, of course. Thus, we are dealing with a Being beyond us, yetof our own kind, in a sense. He is “of us”. See AL I.60.29. I have found that which could not be found; I have found a vessel ofquicksilver.Stability has been found on a basis of change.30. Thou shalt instruct thy servant in his ways, thou shalt speak often with him.Seems an injunction to the Holy Guardian Angel to keep in close touch with theAdept.Not so; it is an injunction to the Adept to keep in close touch with the “scribe”­hisphysical instrument of manifestation. The injunction comes from the Angel. Adeptsfrequently dislike going down into the filthy mud of matter to instruct that blindcreature of slime from which they emerged as butterflies from a cocoon. This kind ofattitude, carried too far, makes for “black brotherhood” on the Adept’s part. Thissubject has been treated at great length by many different systems.31. (The scribe looketh upwards and crieth) Amen! Thou hast spoken it, LordGod!The Adept accepts this as a definite promise.In this note we see the essential spiritual humility of Aleister Crowley, to whom theAdept was but the scribe to his Angel. But the verse says scribe, and means scribe:that syndrome linga sharira + sthula sharira+ prana + kama + manas of which wehave already spoken. Naturally the scribe jumps to the occasion and upholds theAngel’s decision.The worst mistake that a spiritual nature may do is to despise or neglect“material’ and “animalistic” things. Man, the great beast of the fields, is on thisplanet and at the present time the Crossroads or Creation: the being which unitesangel (do not confuse with the H.G.A.) and beast in one sole nature, the being wherethe Four Elemental Forces are to be harmonized, under the influence of Akasha, intothe pentagram. It is the god suspended on the cross. Should the Initiate neglect andscorn that lower (but is it lower, from the point of view of the Infinite Abyss of theVoid? For then what is up? what is down? what is above? what is below?) part ofthe sphinx whereon he rides, by that much neglect will be become less well­served bythose faculties thereby represented. And since, so far as we now are able to perceive,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the purpose of evolution is the spiritualization of blind matter, by that much neglectwill he turn against the cosmic tide. “My adepts stand upright, their head above theheavens, their feet below the hells.” Liber XC 40.32. Further Adonai spake unto V.V.V.V.V. and said:33. Let us take our delight in the multitude of men! Let us shape unto ourselvesa boat of mother­of­pearl from them, that we may ride upon the river of Amrit!32­33. Proposal to view phenomena from the new standpoint.34. Thou seest yon petal of amaranth, blown by the wind from the low sweetbrows of Hathor?35. (The Magister saw it and rejoiced in the beauty of it.) Listen!36. (From a certain world came an infinite wail.) That falling petal seemed tothe little ones a wave to engulph their continent.34­36. Two points of view: as a girl’s smile involves the death of many cells in herbody.37. So they will reproach thy servant, saying: Who hath set thee to save us?The above explains why men should resent their savior. They misinterpret his actsas destructive.And, of course, quite often they are right. If you are going to build a new house,you must first raze down the old one. The Magus destroys with the dagger; the moreskillful He is, the better He wields this weapon. A.C. ;himself, chipping away at apiece of wood in his retirement in Lake Pasquaney, suddenly realized how the workof destruction can result in creation: you chip away your material so that your visiontakes shape in what is left. But certainly you chip away. And the chipped­awaymaterial has every right to howl. Of course, so do you have every right to chip!There are several other meanings to the verse, all of them most subtle and mostwise. We would call the attention of Major Adepts, for instance, to the unusual verbalconstruction of the question.38. He will be sore distressed.He in his human mind, is distressed at this.The “servant” is, of course, the “scribe”, that is, the initiated instrument of flesh.39. All they understand not that thou and I are fashioning a boat of mother­of­pearl. We will sail down the river of Amrit even to the yew­groves of Yama,where we may rejoice exceedingly."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"40. The joy of men shall be our silver gleam, their woe our blue gleam — all inthe mother­of­pearl.39­40. But the whole relation is allusion. In reality the Angel and the Adept aresimply arranging to sail through eternity together; the Work of the Adept inredeeming Mankind is only an image seen as he fashions his mother­of­pearl.Well, not quite. The relation is very real: only, on the plane of men the Adeptseems to be busy “saving” mankind; on the plane where the river of Amrit flows, heand his Angel are fashioning a boat of mother­of­pearl. The boat, besides being afemale symbol, is a symbol of the persistence of life through generations. Mother­of­pearl is the substance that gives origin to the pearl, which is sacred to the Moon andto Binah. Mother­of­pearl indicates therefore She who is the Mother of Binah, that isto say, Nuit.The supposed process of “salvation” of mankind is therefore a magickal processof immortalization, or perpetuation, of that complex of energies which we call theAdept. To go deeper into this subject at present would be to foster speculation andfantasy in the inexperienced. Suffice it to say that this whole process is quitecommonplace. All adepts go through it. We refer serious students to AL II.44.41. (The scribe was wroth thereat. He spake: O Adonai and my master, I haveborne the inkhorn and the pen without pay, in order that I might search thisriver of Amrit, and sail thereon as one of ye. This I demand for my fee, that Ipartake of the echo of your kisses.)42. (And immediately it was granted unto him.)41­42. The human mind demands to be relieved of its sorrow by seeing Nature inthis light on the ground that it has served the Masters with unselfish devotion.Nonsense! The human mind demands the reward for which it has been willing tobear the inkhorn and the pen without material reward. Its devotion has been entirelyselfish, but intelligent. Else the mind would be unsound. It is a lie, this folly againstself. We do not serve the Masters because we are slaves who will to serve. We servethem in order to learn their “secrets” and become Masters ourselves. (They have, inreality, no “secrets”. Their only secret is their greater awareness and experience. Byserving them, we increase ours.) The scribe in the verses, indignant upon realizingthat the Adepts are not really “saving” anybody but themselves, demands thefulfillment of his contract. The accounting is immediately done, for the Masters,unlike “black brothers”, pay their debts.43. (Nay; but not therewith was he content. By an infinite abasement untoshame did he strive. Then a voice:)The mind demanded complete relief.Not so: complete initiation. It is based in shame because it realizes how gross andperceptionless it is compared to the Angel and its Master (the Buddhi­"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Consciousness).44. Thou strivest ever; even in thy yielding thou strivest to yield — and lo! thouyieldest not.45. Go thou unto the outermost places and subdue all things.46. Subdue thy fear and thy disgust. Then — yield!By “everything possible” is meant the “outermost”. This refers to the outermostboundaries of consciousness, which of course includes the microcosmic qliphoth. It isa well­known fact that we do not know the external universe, we know only thereaction produced in our consciousness by the contact of our “ego”­the Ahamkara­with it. This contact is constantly shifting, and the Ahamkara itself is a living,that is, adynamic, thing. The Universe includes “demons”, elementals, larvae, “shells” of theQabalists­it includes, indeed, all kinds of very nasty things of which we are notusually aware, for we rarely take the trouble of extending consciousness to theoutposts of our being. Yet, intelligence­in the sense of efficient communication­is oneof the priorities in a successful army. Our consciousness is a Legion, but unless thisLegion is disciplined and has a General in command, we are victims of some form ofinsanity or another. And if parts of our Legion are under our control, but we are noteven aware of the existence of others, it cannot be said that the Commander is truly aGeneral. The General commands all.All this is connected with the legend that the Christ­consciousness­the Adept­has togo down into hell. The forces which are strong enough, gross enough, insensitiveenough­and yet sensitive enough at the same time­to sustain our contact with theexternal Universe partake, of necessity, of the nature of this external Universe. Thusthe “pagans” and “godless” and “demons” which inhabit the boundaries of theCircle of the Magician. The circle must expand continuously, and control overenvironment is the aim of the Master. He must subdue all things­including his fearand his disgust of the most external things. Only when he is the true Commander ofhimself­the true Master of the Temple­is he qualified to yield to the Angel. Hisexpansion of consciousness is always in direct proportion to his extent of self­control.Thus it can be perceived that any Initiate who becomes static is undergoing apsychic state similar to that of the “black brothers”. Usually, however, the Enemy­the external Universe­soon comes to strike his shield and defy him to mortal combatin the eternal Comedy­Tragedy of Pan. If this does not happen­and sometimes, in thePlay of the Waters, a twig may remain stationary for a season (see Liber Aleph,166)­then the Initiate may temporarily become like a “black brother” indeed. Theonly difference will be in the telepathic influence­if any!47. There was a maiden that strayed among the corn, and sighed; then grew anew birth, a narcissus, and therein she forgot her sighing and her loneliness.48. Even instantly rode Hades heavily upon her, and ravished her away."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"47 — 48Persephone, the earth­bound soul. Corn = material nourishment; its result issorrow. Narcissus = the sexual instinct flowering as Beauty.Instantly the soul forgets the “corn” and desires the flower, Hades comes andcarries her off. Hades is the lord of “Hell,” i.e., the dark and secret but divine Soulwithin every man and woman. The rape thus means that the desire for Beautyawakes the Unconscious Self who then takes possession of the Soul, and enthronesher, only allowing her return to earth (Knowledge of the material world) at certainseasons, in order to attend to the welfare of mankind.49. (Then the scribe knew the narcissus in his heart; but because it came not tohis lips, therefore was he shamed and spake no more.)I was seized by the impulse to adore Beauty, and felt ashamed at my inability towrite a poem on the spot which should be worthy of the theme.Nevertheless, this is exactly what he was doing then, writing LXV! But of course, itwas not the scribe who was writing it...Or so the scribe thought.This kind of seesaw effect is characteristic of the operation of the Ahamkara, orEgo­making faculty, and must be carefully studied. See and compare LXV v 23­26.50. Adonai spake yet again with V.V.V.V.V. and said: The earth is ripe forvintage; let us eat of her grapes, and be drunken thereon.50­58. An elaborate Parable in dialogue.50. The Angel bids the Adept rejoice in certain events which are about to occur onearth.51. And V.V.V.V.V. answered and said: O my lord, my dove, my excellent one,how shall this word seem unto the children of men?The Adept doubts whether his doctrine will be understood rightly by mankind.52. And He answered him: Not as thou canst see. It is certain that every letter ofthis cipher hath some value; but who shall determine the value? For it variethever, according to the subtlety of Him that made it.The Angel agrees; but is more skeptical still, suggesting that any event may betaken as meaning anything one chooses.Not exactly this: The Angel rather intimates that messages produced from certainlevels of consciousness are universal in character, and can be translated by thelistener into terms related to his or her own from a of reference without therebydiminishing their basic meaning or import. Such is the case with all A∴ A∴publications in Class A.53. And He answered Him: Have I not the key thereof? I am clothed with the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"body of flesh; I am one with the Eternal and Omnipotent God.The Adept claims to be able to interpret phenomena rightly; that there is onespecial relation which is true, and all others false. He reminds the Angel that herealises Himself (as an unique Being always identical with Itself) alike in the lowestmatter and the highest spirit.As we can see, Masters (note the use of the capital H in both pronouns andcompare with 52) are not any more immune to the symptoms of the Ahamkara thanany other kind of human being. It is as if Picasso, indignant, protested that hispictures had only one legitimate meaning: the meaning that he himself found in them.Of course, the Angel soon puts his client right.54. Then said Adonai: Thou hast the Head of the Hawk, and thy Phallus is thePhallus of Asar. Thou knowest the white, and thou knowest the black, and thouknowest that these are one. But why seekest thou the knowledge of theirequivalence?The Angel asks why one who possesses absolute Sight and Lordship and power tosoar (the Head of the Hawk) who has creative energy able to fertilize Nature, hismother, sister, and wife (The Phallus of Asar) one who knows the pairs of opposites,and the fact of their identity, should trouble to calculate the equations which expressthe relations between the illusory symbols of diversity.55. And he said: That my Work may be right.The Adept replies that he must understand the laws of illusion in order to work inthe world of illusion.Not exactly: please note the lower­case h of the pronoun. Here it is no longer theAdept consciousness, the Master consciousness, speaking: it is the mere initiatedman, ego hurting, who wants to keep his cake at the same time that he eats it. Hisexplanation is a mere rationalization of his frustration at the fact that apparently hehas no control over his own work.56. And Adonai said: The strong brown reaper swept his swathe and rejoiced.The wise man counted his muscles, and pondered, and understood not, and wassad. Reap thou, and rejoice!The Angel replies that such calculations lead one to believe in the reality of theillusions, to become confused by their complex falsities, and ultimately, mistrustingone’s own powers, to fail to act for fear of making mistakes; whereas it does notreally matter what one does, since one set of illusions is just as good as another. Thebusiness of the Adept is to do his Work manfully and joyously, without lust of resultor fear of accident. He should exercise his faculties to the full; the free fulfillment oftheir functions is sufficient justification. To become conscious of any organ isevidence that it is out of order."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Actually, the point made is: Do what thou wilt. The scribe is merely sulking, he isnot really interested in the equations, as another star might be. Her serves aMagician, not an Accountant.57. Then was the Adept glad, and lifted his arm. Lo! an earthquake, andplague, and terror on the earth! A casting down of them that sate in highplaces; a famine upon the multitude!The Adept takes this advice, and puts forth his energy. The apparent result of hisWork is disaster.Not so: this is the preliminary razing of the old house ere the new one can be built.The last two world wars are but preliminary to the establishment of the Law ofΘελημα upon the earth.58. And the grape fell ripe and rich into his mouth.But the whole idea of his relation with Mankind as a Redeemer provesphantasmagoric. The truth of the matter is that he has “eaten a grape.” i.e., begun toenjoy the banquet with his Angel proposed in Verse 50. (Cf. CCXX I.31)The relationship of the Adept to mankind as Redeemer is not phantasmagoric onthis plane. He is a Redeemer; he is the new Christ. But on the plane of the “river ofAmrit” he and his Angel are merely fashioning their boat of mother­of­pearl. Thesetwo “truths” are not exclusive; in fact, the existence of one depends on the existenceof the other.59. Stained is the purple of thy mouth, O brilliant one, with the white glory ofthe lips of Adonai.Every act of the Adept is really the kiss of his Angel.Not exactly what is meant here; for the purple of the grape juice on the Adept’slips is stained with the white glory of the lips of the Angel. Better say that everymagickally creative act of the Adept is energized or guided or aided by the spiritualenergy of his Angel. See LXV III.13­17 and the comments thereon.60. The foam of the grape is like the storm upon the sea; the ships tremble andshudder; the shipmaster is afraid.The ecstasy of the relation between the Adept and his Angel disperses “normal”thoughts; the Ego fears to lose control of the course of the mind. This (of course)occurs in a less real sphere, that of normal consciousness. The Ego is justlyapprehensive, for this ecstasy will lead to a situation when its annihilation will bedecreed so that the Adept may cross the Abyss and become a Master of the Temple.Remember that the Ego is not really the centre and crown of the individual; indeedthe whole trouble arises from its false claim to be so.61. That is thy drunkenness, O holy one, and the winds whirl away the soul of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the scribe into the happy haven.The ecstasy of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angelbrings peace to “the soul of the scribe” (his conscious mind) by impressing suchenergy on his thoughts that their normal conflict (which causes sorrow) becomesnegligible, just as the personal antagonisms in a cavalry regiment are forgotten in theexcitement of a charge.62. O Lord God! let the haven be cast down by the fury of the storm! Let thefoam of the grape tincture my soul with Thy light!But the mind, knowing that the old quarrels will revive when the ecstasy haspassed, asks that this anesthesia may be removed. It aspires to enter into the rapturewith every element of its being, no matter of the pain. It knows that it can never betruly content until each separate fibre thrill harmoniously to that supremeenchantment.63. Bacchus grew old, and was Silenus; Pan was ever Pan for ever and evermore throughout the aeons.It knows that the lower types of intoxication were excitements, and in stupor andsenility. It demands the Madness of Pan, the building up of every particle of its beinginto a single symbol to include All. This symbol is to combine the intelligence(omniscience) of Man with the omnipotence typified by horns, and the creativerapture of the leaping Goat. This Pan is not intoxicated, but wholly insane, beingbeyond distinction (knowledge) as including all in itself; he is also immune to time,since whatever happens can only be within himself; that is, all events are equally theexercise of his functions, and therefore accompanied by rapture, since He hasincluded all possibilities in His unity so that any change is part of His life, an act oflove under will.64. Intoxicate the inmost, O my lover, not the outermost!This is presumable once more the voice of the Angel. He bids the Adept pay lessattention in the future to the transmutation of gross impressions into the raptures ofunion. The greater work is to cause the Unconscious to interpenetrate with the Angel.For such is the ultimate Sacrament is only too liable to be contented with theconscious joy of causing just those thoughts which have always been the source oferror to glow with purity and splendour at the touch of the Angel. But it is far moreimportant to renounce those rewards, ineffably holy and delightful though they be inorder to perfect the Inmost Self, to purge it of personality and unite it with theUniverse, though such Attainment lie too deep for direct conscious apprehension.In short, go to the outermost places and subdue all things, then yield­andintoxicate the inmost.65.

I have aimed at the peeled wand of my God, and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"I have hit; yea, I have hit.In a secret code the Adept affirms that he is of the same sex; (so to speak) as hisAngel. It is not a union of opposites to produce a tertium quid, but a realization ofidentity, like the return to consciousness from delirium, whose ecstasy bears no fruitinvolving new responsibilities, new possibilities of sorrow, but is all­sufficient toitself, with neither past nor future. The “peeled wand” is the creative Energy of theAngel, stripped of all veils, pointing to the Zenith, ready and eager to act. The Adeptexclaims with joy that he has aspired to unite himself with this Idea, and has attained.In short, by induction, spiritual puberty was achieved. The Angel is bi­sexual, orbetter, omni­sexual. He is a cosmic, or if you prefer, macrocosmic being. In it highestsense, of course, Pan is Nuit....Thus concludes the description of the relations of the Adept and his Angel so far asthe element of Earth, the concrete and manifest aspect of Nature, is concerned. Thewhole illusion has been destroyed; the bread has become the body of God. Yet this isbut the lowest form of existence; in the next chapter we shall understand how themind­as distance from the matter of thought­is concentrated and sanctified by theMagick of the Adept.CHAPTER IIThe previous chapter describes the effect wrought by the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel upon the outward appearances of thingsand the sensations caused and the corresponding part of the Soul, Nephesch.We now turn to the element of Air, the faculties called Ruach, that is, the mindconsidered as an instrument of intellectual apprehension, a machine proper to theanalysis of impressions and their interpenetration in terms of conscious thought. TheWork of attaining to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angelbeing in Tiphereth, the Centre of the Ruach, the result of success is to harmonize,concentrate, and glorify the medley of loose ideas which are suggested by themeaningless multiplicity of mental concepts.1.

So came I to Duant, the starry abode, and I heard voices crying aloud.Being now open to the whole Universe, the Soul hears whatever is spoken. (Air isthe vehicle of sound).To mix metaphor with objective scientific information is sometimes dangerous. Airis not the only vehicle of sound, and any way, in the mystical symbology of theelements, hearing is referred to Akasha. We might say, therefore, that here is spokenof Akasha Vay, Sub­Element of the Element of Air which is, so to speak, the Root ofemotions are referred to Water. But of course thought and emotion, in what theyinteract, partake of the nature of both, and sometimes more, Elements. It must alwaysbe kept in mind­if you will pardon the pun­that this Chapter refers to mind from thepoint of view of Spirit, that is, from the point of view of Initiation.3. O Thou that sittest upon the Earth! (so spake a certain Veiled One to me)thou art not greater than thy mother! Thou speck of dust infinitesimal! Thouart the Lord of Glory, and the unclean dog.A “Veiled One” (Isis) explains that no individual consciousness can be more thanthe sphere of which it is born and which constitutes its environment. It is equallysupreme and vile, these qualities being illusions produced by artificial relations, whichmay be chosen at will.May be chosen at will before incarnation, and even then within limits. Afterincarnation, you are bound by your genetic limitations. You can do much, as inInitiate; but you are limited by your inherited combination of chromosomes.This is one of the many reasons­all of them selfish, We assure­why the Adepts arecontinuously trying to improve mankind. The4 healthier, subtler, more complexcombinations are available, the greater the chances of expansion. Samadhiexperienced by the brain of a 75 IQ is not the same as that of a brain of 300 IQ. Evenif it happens to be the same kind of samadhi. You can’t make a silk purse out of asow’s ear. But you can make a beautiful purse out of pig leather, if you are skilful,and the pig healthy enough before death. In short, you must work with the material atyour disposal, you must accept the fact that this material is basically an animal, andyou must never make the mistake of denying or mortifying or restricting the beast inyou. It must be trained, not broken!4. Stooping down, dipping my wings, I came unto the darkly­splendid abodes."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"There in that formless abyss was I made a partaker of the Mysteries Averse.The Godhead, in order to realize itself, must involuntarily submit to undergo theexperience of imperfection. It must take the Sacrament which unites it with the darkglamour of “Evil,” the counterpart of that which exalts the “Sinner” to Godhead.The concept of God coming down into matter in order to “redeem” it is false,connected with the psychological hiatus between Chesed and Binah. The fable of theFall was invented to explain why man is so unfortunately constituted (from the pointof view of lazy men, of course), and to uphold the Father­Image at any cost. Inreality, the hiatus is due to the fact that man is a Spiritual entity quickening the bodyand mind of an animal. There is no physiological connection in the brain between thefaculties called the Supernals by the Qabalists and the highest faculty of the homosaps: Chesed. Daath is therefore an artificial construct (again the Ahamkara) withthe purpose of making possible integration between the God and the man. Itsinefficiency is due to its very recent apparition. All the faculties related to the higherManas and to Buddhi­Manas are liable to confusion and error at this stage ofevolution, because they are new, and still at the experimental stage. And the lowerfaculties, left to themselves, work well from a worldly point of view: the man (orwoman) is happy, contented, prosperous, and dead to the higher life. As soon as thehigher faculties become active, happiness of this sort disappears. The man, no matterhow brilliant, proves incapable of providing his own living or that of his family;becomes “anti­social” and quite often ends up in prison or in the asylum. In the landof the blind the one­eyed man had better run for his life. Check Liber VII II.27­33.The purpose is to create a human type capable of living the higher life while in thebody of flesh, and doing it without trouble, perturbation or unnecessary pain. Thispurpose may take Us a few hundred thousand years yet to accomplish, but that isOur program. Until then.Why then does God come into matter? To enrich His­Her­Its Experience. And thisenriching of experience is basically a selfish impulse. We are not trying to “save”man. Dammit, We are man. Without Us, there is only the monkey and the blind thingof slime here, as LXV itself will make clear later on.5. I suffered the deadly embrace of the Snake and of the Goat; I paid theinfernal homage to the shame of Khem.It accepts the formulae of: (a) Duality,i.e., life as vibration. (a­1) Death.

Therein was this virtue, that the One became the all.The object of this act is to realize the possibilities of one’s unity by representing itswholeness as an infinite number of particular cases, just as one might try to get anidea of the meaning of “poetry” by studying all available poems.

Moreover I beheld a vision of a river. There was a little boat thereon; and init under purple sails was a golden woman, an image of Asi wrought in finestgold. Also the river was of blood, and the boat of shining steel. Then I loved her;and, loosing my girdle, cast myself into the stream.The river is the stream of thought. The boat is the consciousness. The purple sailsare the passions that direct its course, and the woman is the pure Ideal which oneseeks to make the constant occupant and the guiding principle of one’s conscious life.Thus “woman”, though of gold, is only a lifeless image. The river is of blood; that is,the current of thought must be identified with the object of one’s like, not a meremedium for reflecting every casual impression.The boat is of steel; that is, the consciousness must be able to resist the intrusion ofall undesired thoughts. Loving this ideal, the Aspirant frees himself from all that bindshim (shame, selfishness, etc. — “loosing my girdle”) and loses his ego in Thoughtitself (cast myself into the stream).8. I gathered myself into the little boat, and for many days and nights did I loveher, burning beautiful incense before her.He identifies himself with pure consciousness, immune from, yet floating upon, thecourse of Thought, and devotes himself to this Ideal, with poetical and religiousfervour.9. Yea! I gave her of the flower of my youth.He consecrates his creative energy to the Ideal.10. But she stirred not; only by my kisses I defiled her so that she turned toblackness before me.This process destroys the superficial beauty of the Ideal. Its purity is corrupted bythe contact of mortality.11. Yet I worshipped her, and gave her of the flower of my youth.Despite the disappointment, the Aspirant persists in “love under will”. He giveshimself up utterly to Truth, even now when it seems so dark and dreadful.12. Also it came to pass, that thereby she sickened, and corrupted before me.Almost I cast myself into the stream.The Ideal now breaks up into loathsome forms, no longer recognizable as theobject of his love.

His ideal appears in its true form, a living womaninstead of a dead image of gold. Her substance is now purer than starlight itself; herlips — the instruments of her speech and her caresses — are full of life and warmth asthe sunset — i.e., they promise repose, love and Beauty (Hathor, goddess of theWest). She is alive with the pure energy of the centre of the system to which theAspirant belongs; i.e., she is the realization of the creative idea of which he has tillnow been only one part.14. Then rose she up from the abyss of Ages of Sleep, and her body embracedme. Altogether I melted into her beauty and was glad.The darkness of the past disappears as his Ideal possesses the Aspirant; and hisEgo dissolves in the ecstasy of union with Her; he becomes the essence of all Joy.15. The river also became the river of Amrit, and the little boat was the chariotof the flesh, and the sails thereof the blood of the heart that beareth me, thatbeareth me.Now then do his thoughts themselves become immortal; his consciousness isunderstood to be the vehicle of his physical life — instead of vice­versa, as theuninitiate supposes. His passions are no longer symptoms of discontent, but identicalwith his individual life. There is thus no conflict with Nature. The Will is itself theSelf.This is of course a description of Integration, or Initiation. Also, however, thewhole operation is viewed from another plane, and according to another possibleformula of Attainment­not the one of the Savior­Adept, of course.In each aeon there is an Adept who is chosen to the Christ of the aeon. In thisaeon, he is ΤΟ ΜΕΓΑ ΘΗΡΙΟΝ, 666, who was incarnated as Aleister Crowley. Thechoice is karmic, that is to say, cosmic. The Adept is chosen because the complex ofenergies which he represents harmonizes best with the cosmic complex of energieswhich provides the magickal currents of the aeon. He is, of course, the Magus of theAeon.16. O serpent woman of the stars! I, even I, have fashioned Thee from a paleimage of fine gold.My own conception of Nuit is the result of the Magical Operation which Iperformed to give life to the ideal which I originally had in my heart, adored, andresolved to realise.The whole passage describes the process of dealing with any given idea so as tobring it to perfection."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"17. Also the Holy One came upon me, and I beheld a white swan floating in theblue.17­26. The swan is the ecstatic Consciousness of the Adept. It is poised in infinitespace, supported by Air — i.e., the medium of thought.The Holy One came upon me” is an expression with double meaning. In a sense itmeans, “I was taken up in samadhi”. In another sense it means that theconsciousness of the Angel, or guru (a lower case, but the expression is common inHindu mysticism), enveloped the Adept, or the chela, thereby stimulating the lowermind into spiritual perception. The effect of this “overshadowing” depends entirelyon the level of development of the overshadowed. The more awake you are, theampler the experience resulting from the interpenetration of your aura by the aura ofthe Angel. See Liber Samekh and the Scholia thereon.Do not, either, misunderstand the expression “overshadowed”. It is not hypnotismor domination or possession, but rather a phenomenon akin to resonance, in which,if a violin vibrates near another, the cords of the other instrument will tend to vibratealso.18. Between its wings I sate, and the aeons fled away.In Ecstasy time does not count.Rather say the time flows at a different rate of speed. It counts, but according toanother formula.19. Then the swan flew and dived and soared, yet no whither we went.The Ecstasy moves from one sublimity of Joy to another; but there is no progresspossible in perfection, therefore no aim to be attained by such movements.Again, this state is not “perfection”. Perfection is a limit to which we tend, but theday we believe we reached it we are dead. Hence Goethe’s Faust andMephistopheles.20. A little crazy boy that rode with me spake unto the swan, and said:The boy is the human reason, which demands measurement as the first condition ofintelligible consciousness. Aware of time, he cannot understand why all this motionhas not brought the swan nearer to some fixed point, or how the relation of the pointof origin to its present position is not an ever­present anxiety. He cannot conceive ofmotion without reference to fixed axes.The most interesting point in this is the description of the human reason as “a littlecrazy boy”. We have, therefore, a faculty that is very young and which has not yetbecome fully harmonized.21. Who art thou that dost float and fly and dive and soar in the inane?

No whither!I reply that, apprehending the continuum (Nuit) as such, no “space­ marks” exist.It is utter folly to ask when the Universe began and when it will end, or to ask whocreated everything. We are mortal creatures, that is, creatures of vibration, and weperceive the external universe through our instrument of perception, which is vitiatedby its own limitations. Why should things have had to be created? Why should theyhave to have a beginning or an end? Actually, the energy which animates us in ourshort crawl over the surface of this planet (or our occasional jumps away from it) isnot affected by the transmutations of our flesh. It has existed before we did, and willcontinue to exist after we no longer do. For us there is whence and whither, but ifthere is the same for it, it will be according to rather different parameters. All thingsare, and have always been, changing. There is no “Reason” to think that they notalways will. Theories such as entropy are merely extrapolations of our own sense offiniteness. Actually, scientists are beginning to suspect that matter is continuouslybeing created and dying all over the universe. Precisely as human beings, not to sayall other forms of life.23. The swan being silent, he answered: Then, if with no goal, why this eternaljourney?The swan is of course silent: Ecstasy transcends expression. Reason asks themotive of motion, in the absence of all destination.The swan has always been, in toe Orient, a symbol of samadhi. Hence the mysticaltitle Paramahanse­the Transcendental Swan, that is, the mystic who has conqueredSamadhi perfectly.24. And I laid my head against the Head of the Swan, and laughed, saying: Isthere not joy ineffable in this aimless winging? Is there not weariness andimpatience for who would attain to some goal?The Adept bringing this thought closes to Ecstasy, laughs, both for pure joy, and asamused by the incongruous absurdities of “rational” arguments from which he is nowfor ever free, expresses his idea thus: Thus free exercise of some object thereby, itwould imply the pain of desire, the strain of effort, and the fear of failure.It must be understood that the planes cannot be mixed. On the plane in which wenormally live, that indeed where the ‘little boy’ holds sway, the pain of desire, thestrain of effort and the fear of failure are normal mind­kama states. It is theperception that they are relations, and not absolutes, that produces in Initiates thatstrange (strange to normal mankind, it must be understood) detachment that makesthem sometimes laugh in situations where other men might cry. Nevertheless we mustact, on this plane of the ‘little crazy boy’, according to the rules of the game, if wewant to ‘win’ on this plane.

And the swan was ever silent. Ah! but we floated in the infinite Abyss. Joy!Joy! White swan, bear thou ever me up between thy wings!Ecstasy remains undisturbed. But the dialogue has caused the Adept to reflect moredeeply on his state of bliss, so that the Ecstasy becomes motionless, realizing itsperfect relation to the Infinity of the continuum.The Adept demands that ecstasy shall be constant.26. O silence! O rapture! O end of things visible and invisible! This is all mine,who am Not.Silence ends the imperfection implied in speech — all words being evidence ofduality, of a breach in Perfection.Rapture: the end of the conflict between any two things; they are dissolved byLove; and, losing the sense of the Ego which caused the pain of feeling itsseparateness from the All, its imperfection, the release from strain is expressed asrapture.“O end of all things visible and invisible!” This not only means that all things —being imperfect — are destroyed, but that this is their true end — Τελος — theirperfection.“This is all mine, who am Not.” The Adept is now possessed of all things, beingcome to the state called “Not” which contains them all, and of which they are merelyimages.So long as he was a positive Ego, he was one of them, and opposed to them; theywere not his. To make them his he must become the continuum in which all thingsexist potentially as members of any series that may be selected to illustrate anydesired properties of its Nature.The state of ‘Not’ may also be defined as the Nuptials of Nuit and Hadit, or theawakening and interaction of Ajna and Sahashara.27. Radiant God! Let me fashion an image of gems and gold for Thee! that thepeople may cast it down and trample it to dust! That Thy glory may be seen ofthem.The Adept is moved to manifest the Godhead which he has beheld by means ofpoetry. He foresees that the vulgar will be enraged, despise his books and stamp themunder foot; but by their thus acting, their eyes will be opened to the glory of the God.This may mean that my work may reawaken real religious fervour in those who havelost all faith and vision; their wrath against me will arouse them to realize that at thebottom of their hearts there is the instinct that they are spiritual beings.‘That Thy glory may be seen of them’ is a phrase so awkwardly constructed as tobe interpreted also as “That they may perceive that the glory they see is their own.”This is obviously on purpose.Whenever a man says “I am God” he awakens the indignation of most of his"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"fellows. They do not realize that this indignation comes from the fact that whetherthey worship a God or not, subconsciously they identify their own innermost naturewith Godhead. The indignation actually means: “No, you sonofabitch, you can’t beGod, because I am.” Adepts are therefore usually prudent enough no to declare theirdivinity. Friedrich Nietzsche, who reached Tiphereth only through his own genius,unfortunately had not sufficient magickal training to be discreet, and went aroundacting and speaking like the incarnation of Dionysus that he was. As a consequence,he ended his days in an insane asylum. The same kind of fate greeted Ezra Poundand Wilhelm Reich among others. That such men were sent to insane asylums doesnot condemn them, but shames the society in which they happened to move. Ancienttribes, being closer to nature, respect madmen and say, rightly, that they are“possessed by the gods.” Left strictly alone, and being treated with gentleness andrespect, people passing through mystical trances of this sort will graduallyequilibrate their divers planes of consciousness and achieve a state of integrationmuch ampler than the one they had before, thereby enriching the life of their society.Indeed, this is true of most psychological disturbances. Hopeless insanity may be theresult of going through a spiritual awakening amongst “normal” people­who are,most of them, totally insane (‘a little crazy boy’) as well as immature from the pointof view of the Supernals.28. Nor shall it be spoken in the markets that I am come who should come; butThy coming shall be the one word.My religious work will not result in my bing acknowledged as the Redeemer: butmen will admit that the Spirit of the Sun God Horus has breathed upon them andinfused their clay with life.“Radiant God” is, of course, in any aeon, the God or Goddess ‘enthroned in Ra’sseat’, and here we are treating of problems of the Hierarchy. In any aeon there isRa’s viceroy, a minister of Hoorpakraath (that is, a Hierophant of the Magi), and theMagus of the aeon (sometimes there is more than one, although this will not be thecase in the present aeon), who is the Hierophant of the Masters of the Temple. Weare, of course, using thelemic terms and dealing with thelemic classification.Therion is an Adept of such high order that He is not in the least interested inbeing acknowledged as Redeemer: he wants mankind to experience direct contactwith the Supreme Hierophant, Heru­ra­ha in this aeon. Θελημα has come to lift thehuman race to a degree hitherto undreamed of civilization and spiritual progress.Therefore he withdraws into being simply the Channel whereby normalconsciousness may get in touch with that Radiating Force of the Spiritual Sun. (Theviceroy, of course, stimulates Kether­consciousness.)29. Thou shalt manifest Thyself in the unmanifest; in the secret places men shallmeet with thee, and Thou shalt overcome them.Horus will be recognized as the explanation of all those energies of the Universewhich we know must exist, although our senses cannot perceive them. Men shall"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"perceive Horus when they explore the mysteries of Nature — e.g., the Unconsciousin Man, or the structure of the Atom. He shall compel them to admit that He is theultimate principle underlying all manifestation, against their old theories.(The exact meaning of “Horus” in this passage must be drawn from CCXX Cap;III.)We are going a little too far here. Horus is not the ultimate principle underlying allmanifestation: this principle is Nuit. Nevertheless, because of His position as Kether­Consciousness, He will lead scientists and artists into a greater perception of theUniverse­a perception which will be naturally tinted by the complex of energies thatform the present Aeon of Aquarius­Leo, and tinted by the Nature of the God itself. Heis, in Himself, a Star­gigantic in comparison to normal mankind, an Ipsissimus of thehighest order. He is, also, the Absolute Monarch of Initiation in this Aeon. To gocounter Him is the ultimate failure, and to disobey or disrespect Him is fatal. This isdue to the enormous potential of energy concentrated around His work, of which Heis the center and point of balance. To go against him is to lose yourself in amaelstrom of forces which go nowhere and which will tear you apart. And yet­howdare they who dare touch their spear to this Shield! The God laughs His rapture, andproves Himself.

I saw a pale sad boy that lay upon the marble in the sunlight, and wept. Byhis side was the forgotten lute. Ah! but he wept.Verses 30­36. The Boy is Ganymede, the eagle, the bird of Jupiter. Here he is animage of the Adept.He is pale, as having given his blood to his Work. He is sad, as understanding theSorrow of the Universe. (His Work has itself made him aware of this). He is lyingdown, as weary and in doubt whether it be worth while to work. He is on the marble;that is, the hard bare facts of existence, despite all polish, hurt his flesh. He is in thesunlight; he sees only too clearly into Nature. His Angel shines upon him, but frominaccessible heights. He weeps; he whose duty is to pour wine for the Gods, can butshed forth salt water upon the bare ground. He has laid down and even forgotten hislute. He cannot make music; he has even lost the memory that he could do so of old.31. Then came an eagle from the abyss of glory and overshadowed him. Soblack was the shadow that he was no more visible.The Eagle symbolizes the influence of the Father of the Gods, also the highestform of Magical Life, and the Lordship of Air, i.e., power to rule the world ofthoughts. This overshadows him so as to conceal his personality from sight.The Hawk, the Swan and the Eagle are cognate symbols of Air, but each with adifferent type of function.

But I heard the lute lively discoursing through the blue still air.Thus inspired, he resumes his music joyfully; the air itself becomes still, that is, nothoughts disturb him, and it is blue, being filled with the spirit of holiness, love andpurity.33. Ah! messenger of the beloved One, let Thy shadow be over me!The Adept invokes the Word of his Angel to silence all personal thoughts.Not so: to harmonize them, that is, to organize his human life from the point ofview of Spirit.34. Thy name is Death, it may be, or Shame, or Love. So thou bringest metidings of the Beloved One, I shall not ask thy name.He will accept this in whatever from it may appear; whether death itself benecessary to end the annoyance of the Ego, or Disgrace to make it ashamed to assertitself, or Love to destroy its ambitions.This is the equivalent attitude to the Master of the Temple’s, who swears tointerpret all phenomena as a personal dealing between God and his soul. OswaldSpengler put this in terms more apprehensible by abstract intellection when he said:“Everything of which we are conscious...has for us a deeper meaning still, a finalmeaning. And the one and only means of rendering this incomprehensiblecomprehensible must be a kind of metaphysics which regards everything whatsoeveras having significance as a symbol.”35. Where is now the Master? cry the little crazy boys. He is dead! He isshamed! He is wedded! and their mockery shall ring round the world.His “rational” prejudices will presumably ask — in such a case — “What of yourmagical ambitions? You are not the Master that you wanted to be; you are simply theslave of this Angel of yours ­whatever that may mean­your personality smothered,your ambitions crushed, your sole occupation to echo his remarks, of which you donot even approve.”“You have destroyed your Self; you have earned the abuse of your friends; youhave abandoned your career, and tied yourself to a woman’s whims.”It is not only the Adept’s rational prejudices who will speak to him so; the ‘littlecrazy boys’ indicates all normal minds around him, echoed in or echoing his own.36. But the Master shall have had his reward. The laughter of the mockers shallbe a ripple in the hair of the Beloved One.The Adept admits that his body and mind, left to their fate, have met with thosedisasters.

The truth is to be found in Chapter I.41­46and the Commentaries thereon. What the Adept is trying to attain is beyond th graspof the ‘little crazy boys’. To them he is a fool carrying an empty sack and assaultedby wild beasts, nose turned up into emptiness and an abyss gaping at his feet. Yet thisis the Fool of the Taro, the First Emanation of Kether, the Perfect. See AL I.45Once the Work has been accomplished, however, the Adept must­if he still hastime left in that particular existence­consolidate his gains on the lower planes too.See AL II.2437. Behold! the Abyss of the Great Deep. Therein is a mighty dolphin, lashinghis sides with the force of the waves.37­44. This passage is a parable with several applications.I. It describes the method of attaining Concentration by “the Ladders” (See LiberAleph).II. It indicates how to deal with people whom one wishes to initiate.III. It gives a method for passing from one state of mind to another at Will.The main idea in all three matters is that one must apply the appropriate remedy towhatever malady may actually exist, not some ideally perfect medicine. The firstmatter must be brought step by step through each stage of the process; it is useless totry to obtain the Perfect Tincture from it by making the Final Projection.IV. It describes the whole course of Initiation.These four meanings demand detailed exposition, verse by verse.37. I. The Abyss is the Mind; the Dolphin the uneasy Consciousness.II. Men are ruled by pride and other passionsIII. The dolphin signifies any state of mind that is uneasy, ill​content, and unable toescape from its surroundings.IV. The dolphin is the profane.38. There is also an harper of gold, playing infinite tunes.I. The harper is the teacher whose praise of the Path of the Wise induces theprofane to seek initiation; he is the Guru who stills the mind by making it listen toharmonious sounds, instead of torturing itself by thinking of its pains and its passions.These sounds are produced by mechanical means; they refer to practices like Asana,etc.II. They are best reached by praise of beauty, shown in its most glittering dress.III.

Then the dolphin delighted therein, and put off his body, and became abird.I. Freed from its grossness and violence, the consciousness aspires to lofty ideals. Itis, however, unable to keep quiet, and has little intelligence. It is trained by hearingthe harmony of life — breath inspiring a reed, instead of muscle agitating metal. Thisrefers to Pranayama, but also to apprehending that inspiration is in itself morefluttering; it must learn the art of using every breath to produce harmony.II. 39­40. When taught to aspire, and clean of the baser appetites, teach them theseven sciences.III. Your thought will thus become lyrical; but this will not satisfy your need. Youwill feel the transitory nature of such a thought.40. The harper also laid aside his harp, and played infinite tunes upon the Pan­pipe.I. 40 ­ 41. The consciousness now acquires divine and human completeness. (41):The faun symbolized firm aspiration, creative power, and human intelligence. Thewings of ideal longing are laid down; the thought accepts the fact of its true nature,and aims only at possible perfections.III. Transform it by looking at it as a necessary and important fact in the frameworkof the Universe.IV.

The lyrical exaltation will now pass into a deep realization of yourself and allthat concerns you as an Inhabitant of Nature, containing in your own consciousnessthe elements of the Divine, and the Bestial, both equally necessary to the Wholenessof the Universe. Your original discomfort of mind will now appear as pleasant, since,lacking that experience, you would have been eternally the poorer.IV.

It now hears the harmony of the Universe as expressed in the human voice; thatis, as articulate and intelligible, so that every vibration, besides its power to delight thesenses, appeals to the soul.

Now interpret that experience “as a particular dealing of God with your soul.”Discover an articulate explanation of it: compel it to furnish an intelligible message.IV. 42­43. He then understands all Things, and at last becomes the All.43. Then the faun was enraptured, and followed far; at last the harper wassilent, and the faun became Pan in the midst of the primal forest of Eternity.I. The final stage is reached. All possible positives are known to be errors from theNegative. There is Silence. Then the faun becomes the All. Gone is the limited forestof secondary ideas in which he once dwelt, and left in order to follow the Word thatenchanted him. He is now in the world of Ideas whose nature is simple (primal) andare not determined by such conditions as Time. (A tree is an idea, being phallic andbearing branches.)II. Once they are on the Path, be silent; they will naturally come to Attainment.III. Follow up this train of thought until you enter into Rapture, caused by therecognition of the fact that you — and all else are ecstatic expressions of a sublimeSpiritual spasm, elements of an omniform Eucharist. Truth, no matter how splendid,will now lose all meaning for you. It belongs to a world where discriminationbetween Subject and Predicate is possible, which implies imperfection; and you arerisen above it. You thus become Pan, the All; no longer a part. You thrill with the joyof the lust of creation, become a virgin goddess for your sake. Also, you are insane,sanity being the state which holds things in proper proportion; while you havedissolved all in your own being, in ecstasy beyond all measure.44. Thou canst not charm the dolphin with silence, O my prophet!I. Practice Elementary Yoga until you are perfect: do not try to attain Nibbana tillyou know how.II.

I was alone in a great park, and by a certain hillock was a ring of deepenamelled grass wherein green­clad ones, most beautiful, played.50­52. The park is the world of well­planted and carefully tended Ideas: such asthe scholar and the Man of Letters enjoy. Here I found a place where I could exaltmyself (the hillock). Thereby was a ring (my poetry) in which were fairies (mycharacter, my phrases, my rhythm, etc.)51. In their play I came even unto the land of Fairy Sleep. All my thoughts wereclad in green; most beautiful were they.Playing thus, I reach a state of poetic ecstasy (Fairy Sleep). Here I was happy.52.

Crush out the blood of me, as a grape upon the tongue of a white Doric girlthat languishes with her lover in the moonlight.His presence must leave me no light of my own.Readers may consider the juxtaposition of blood, grape and girl as a poeticmetaphor, and it may be so; however, it can also be a unification of severalmemories into a ‘ripple of His hair’. This is a difficult subject and caution leads usnot to encourage the overly imaginative by enlarging on it at present. We refer theserious student to LXV I.33­40, LXV II.30­33, LXV III.40­46, LXV IV.7, LXV V.47and the Commentaries thereon.55. Then let the End awake. Long hast thou slept, O great God Terminus! Longages hast thou waited at the end of the city and the roads thereof. Awake Thou!wait no more!The End means “The True Self.” Terminus is the Phallic Stone which lies beyondthe mind (city) and its thoughts (roads). By this Union with the Angel I hope to cometo the True Self, the fixed eternal creative individual.This “fixedness” is of course in relation to the Smooth Point, center of the complexof energies called ‘star’.56. Nay, Lord! but I am come to Thee. It is I that wait at last.Having attained the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (bya male effort so to speak) the Adept become receptive, feminine, patient, surrenderinghis will wholly to that of his Angel.The result of this surrender is the awakening of the True Will. See AL I.61 And seethe corresponding paragraphs in Liber NV. It would be possible to explainintellectually this apparent paradox, but we prefer to recall the image of theresonating violin. The Angel is doing His Will; the surrender of the Adept impels himin the direction of his own true orbit. See AL I.45­48 and the Commentaries thereon.57.

But these thy prophets; they must cry aloud and scourge themselves; theymust cross trackless wastes and unfathomed oceans; to await Thee is the end,not the beginning.As things are, though, one is so constituted as to be unable to rest in simplicity.One must go through the mill in order to learn how to wait!The problem arises from the fact that the mind­which, by the way, is very strictlyconnected with the Ahamkara­is a new faculty, just developed. The simplicity towhich A.C. refers is not the simplicity of absence of data, but the simplicity ofharmonization of every single part of one’s mind into an integrated, living whole. Inorder to achieve this, the mind must ‘go to the outermost places and subdue allthings.’63. Let darkness cover up the writing! Let the scribe depart among his ways.The consciousness of the scribe, hitherto required that he might record the sayingsof that part of his Being which we call “the Adept” and of his Angel, is now releasedto attend to its normal affairs.These ‘normal affairs’, nevertheless, are not the affairs of a ‘normal man’, sincethe scribe’s mind is an initiated mind.64. But thou and I are stretched at our ease among the vines; what is he?The Adept and his Angel remain reposing in Rapture: they do not cease to existwhen the scribe no longer perceives them. On the contrary, he seems rather unreal tothem.This is one of the reasons why the Angel orders the Adept­Consciousness to ‘speakoften’ to its servant in LXV I.30­31.

There is “an end,” aPurpose proper to his individuality.The Angel therefore bids him withdraw from the Trance of Union. He is to assumethe form of Hermes (runner — Word­bearer) and deliver the Word entrusted to him tothe “Mighty cities.” This may mean “to the greatest minds of the world.”It will be noted that the Adept echoes the question of the ‘little crazy boy’.The same answer is given, there is no end to rapture; but there is an ‘end’­apurpose­in it. This is related to the Magickal Oath of the A∴ A∴, whose everymember is pledged to help the evolution of mankind. The Adept; must impartinformation; not only the scientific method, but also the scientific ethics of free andfull imparting of information openly to all, are Our way.CHAPTER IIIThis chapter is attributed to Water; it deals with the preliminary reflections of Truthas apprehended by intuition,beyond any intellectual apprehension; and with thenature of the Understanding and the sexual instinct.The Element of Water is of course identified with Emotions and Feelings.Passions, although they partake of water, are initiated by the element of Fire. Thusthe problems (and the solution thereof) of kama, prana and sthula sharira are moreespecially treated here. Manas is involved only insofar as the intellect is affected byApas.1. Verily and Amen! I passed through the deep sea, and by the rivers ofrunning water that abound therein, and I came unto the Land of No Desire.1­2. The sea is the Sensorium of the Soul, and the currents his tendencies — thoseactivities in which he finds pleasure. Until one has passed through the totality ofpossible experience (as divined by estimation of the actualities available in one’s owncase) one cannot reach the state in which all Desire is recognized as futile. Only whenthis is fixed can one perceive the Unicorn­ Μονοκερως de Astris­the single purePurpose (it is white) whose name is written in the way now to be explained.The collar represents completeness­the “infinity” or “eternity” symbolized by aring.

Thename of this Unicorn (whose horn signifies the creative power) is “The Green Linewinds about the Universe.” Note the etymology of Viridis, connected with vir andvis; also the idea of gyrat, reminding one of the aphorism “God is He with the Headof the Hawk, having a spiral force.” The Green Line, here chosen to connote theLimit of the Universe, suggests the Girdle of Venus. The boundary of Existence isthus not a fixed idea, but an ever­growing Vegetable Principle of Life, of the natureof Love. Summing up the doctrine, one may say that the intelligible expression of thepure creative Idea is the omniform principle of Growth.2. Wherein was a white unicorn with a silver collar, whereon was graven theaphorism Linea viridis gyrat universa.3. Then the word of Adonai came unto me by the mouth of the Magister mine,saying: O heart that art girt about with the coils of the old serpent, lift up thyselfunto the mountain of initiation!The Angel then speaks to the human consciousness of the Adept through themedium of his Initiated Self — otherwise he could not understand so exalted amessage. He bids the man as a man (the heart, Tiphereth, the seat of the consciousEgo) acquire the point of view of the Initiate. The old serpent represents the naturalDesire, which is the “cause of Sorrow,” binds man to grovel in the dust, and uniteshim with base animal life.See LXV ii 5. The message is given through Binah, that is, Buddhi itself: the Angelis communicating at a very high level. As to grovelling in the dust, and base animallife, that is part of man; only, the Initiate must turn these forces into Service to theHigher Faculties. When the Eqyptian Initiate said ‘There is no part of me that is notof the Gods’, he did not mean by this that his material body, his etheric and astralbodies, his lover manas, his vitality and his passions had suddenly become divine inthe sense of transcending the planes where they normally functioned. He meantsimply that all his faculties were geared to the purpose of the Gods, that is to say, hisTrue Will was being done without interference from any part of his being; andtherefore saying this he was stating that he was God Made Flesh. And so does thepriest mean it today when he says these words during the Gnostic Mass (See LiberXV).4. But I remembered. Yea, Than, yea, Theli, yea, Lilith! these three were aboutme from of old. For they are one.Than, Theli, and Lilith are three serpentine forms described in the Qabalah. Than isreally Tanha — no pun is suggested, but Th is the letter of Matter, and N representsthe reptilian or piscian idea of Life. It is connected with the “Gluten in the blood”which von Eckharthausen calls “the body of sin.”Theli: li means secret satisfaction — an idea connected with shame. Lilith: lireduplicated and so become tedious ending in material darkness."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Than and Tanha: there is no pun involved, but simply a direct derivation, just asSatan, the Enemy, and SANATANAS, the Eternal, titles of the Suns of the Trimurti.Contact between the Jews and the Eastern systems was always feared by the Jewsbecause of their great emphasis on monotheism and their centuries of conditioning tothe worship of’Jehovah’, with attendant punishments for default.From the point of view of the Initiate, every movementof semen, or every passion,or every desire, or every feeling that is not directly concentrated on Service to theHighest is a breach of Chastity­the most important of the Virtues of an Adept, sincethe sexual instinct connects all the lower faculties directly with the Higher. ThoseSerpentine forms represent thus waste of Kundalini, which is the famous ‘sin againstthe Holy Ghost’. It is a waste of your Life Force itself.Let it be understood that common men are not affected by this ‘sin’. Their normalfate is to be born, live and die. Their troubles begin the moment they take the Oath ofAspiration. It is not exactly that they are swimmin against the tide­not in this Aeon,fortunately. But they were floating along, and now they are trying to swim and thusgo forward faster than their fellows. Energy must be saved, because it is needed forthe extra effort that Initiation costs. If you waste it, you waste your substance itself.Thus Prudence is sister to Chastity, nay, its twin, nay, they are both the self­sameVirtue! See Atu IX in the Taro, and Chapter 53 of Liber Aleph.5. Beautiful wast thou, O Lilith, thou serpent­woman!5­12. The Adept analyses this Demon­Queen of his Nephesch. He recalls hersensory appeal, and notes that, the dissolution of all things being inevitable, the loveof them leads to sorrow and destruction. In verses 11­12, furthermore, he shows thatapart from all considerations of time, the nature of this Desire, properly apprehended,is corruption.6. Thou wast lithe and delicious to the taste, and thy perfume was of muskmingled with ambergris.7. Close didst thou cling with thy coils unto the heart, and it was as the joy of allthe spring.The nature of “Love” should be studied in Little Essays Toward Truth, chapter ofthe same name, particularly the last paragraph. It cannot be too well understood thatall manifestations of human love, even the most lyrical, the happiest, the purest, theones that all churches, from the Roman to the Buddhist, all States, from Italy toChina, approve the “sanctify” with ceremonies and laws, are simply theconvolutions of the old serpent, the activity of an animal instinct, the grunts andcontortions, shomewhat refined in appearance no doubt, of the great apes.8.

I gazed upon the Crystal of the Future, and I saw the horror of the End ofthee.The end here means both the purpose of this force, which is purely animal, and theconsequence of yielding to it, which is severance form the Higher Faculties.11. Further, I destroyed the time Past, and the time to Come — had I not thePower of the Sand­glass?12. But in the very hour I beheld corruption.13. Then I said: O my beloved, O Lord Adonai, I pray thee to loosen the coils ofthe serpent!13­14. It is useless to ask the Angel to free the Adept from such coercion; hismagical force, which is necessary for this Work, is prevented by Desire from so muchas beginning.14. But she was closed fast upon me, so that my Force was stayed in itsinception.This is a very important point: it is useless to ask your Angel to do for you thethings that you must do yourself. The Angel is not a master with a slave, or apuppeteer with his puppets: he is a Teacher to whom the Law of Θελημα is foremost.“So with thy all; thou has no right but to do thy will.” (AL I.42)15. Also I prayed unto the Elephant God, the Lord of Beginnings, whobreaketh down obstruction.The Adept invokes Ganesha, who represents the power of breaking downobstructions. The elephant, “the half­reasoner with the hand,” is the moral force inman, partly intelligent and docile to the control of its Spiritual Master.16. These gods came right quickly to mine aid. I beheld them; I joined myselfunto them; I was lost in their vastness.This moral force brought into action, the Angel also becomes an efficient assistant,and the constraint of Desire disappears altogether.17. Then I beheld myself compassed about with the Infinite Circle of Emeraldthat encloseth the Universe."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Adept now realizes himself as bounded only by the Green Line of verse 2.You will ntoe that the Serpentine Force is the same, but now, so to speak, themagnetic poles have been changed. In essence, the Blind Worm of Slime is also theworm of Hell, Hadit, which is Life, and the giver of Life. Kundalini is sent from theMuladhara up, which is enough to transofrm it form the Demon­Queen Lilith into aManifestation of Nuit. It is not the material at hand that is important, but what you dowith it; or rather, it is not the material at hand which is malignant or “evil”, but youwho surrender your lower self to gross indulgence.18. O Snake of Emerald, Thou hast no time Past, no time To Come. VerilyThou art not.This Line is recognized as equivalent to the Negative — to Nuith Herself.19. Thou art delicious beyond all taste and touch, Thou art not­to­be­beheld forglory, Thy voice is beyond the Speech and the Silence and the Speech therein,and Thy perfume is of pure ambergris, that is not weighed against the finestgold of the fine gold.19­20. This idea of Pure Love is free from all bonds; it gives the true utmostgratification; its perfume (spiritual significance) is not mingled with any imperfectconception. (Ambergris is the perfume of Kether; musk refers to Love in a somewhatanimal sense.)20. Also Thy coils are of infinite range; the Heart that Thou dost encircle is anUniversal Heart.The Angel also is identified with this Green Line, and thereby the consciousness ofthe Adept expands to include the Universe.21. I, and Me, and Mine were sitting with lutes in the market­place of the greatcity, the city of the violets and the roses.21­26. The idea of the Ego must not be used to unite the experience of the Adept.The music of life ceases (in such a case) whenever doubt darkens, trouble disturbs, ortime wearies the consciousness. The Adept must lose himself wholly in theconsciousness of his Angel, which is beyond all such limitations and immune to allattachments — for He is not to be expressed by any fixed Image, such as might bedestroyed.This is not exactly what is supposed to be done. The idea of the Ego must be usedto unite the experience of the Adept below the Abyss; it is impossible to function as ahuman being without the Ahamkara. It is for this purpose that the Ahamkara wasconstructed. But the consciouysness of the Ego must be realized as a convenience,and as relative, not an absolute. The normal lines unting Kama, Manas andAhamkara must be dissolved and replaced by new lines­the lines of Initiation.

The Ahamkara still exists, and still functions; but now the mindknows itself as an instrument and mediator­a “scribe”­and the Kama no longer isattached to the reactions of the Ahamkara.“I”­the active aspect of the Ahamkara. “Me”­the passive aspect of the Ahamkara.“Mine”­the attachment to anything below the Abyss, possible only when some partor another of the Ahamkara becomes static, either through lack of energy at thatspot, or through the formation of energy knots­complexes, as the psychoanalystswould say.“The city of the violets and the roses” is, of course, the mind of Aleister Crowley,which is thus splendidly described.22. The night fell, and the music of the lutes was stilled.Doubt arises: “If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops &does nought.” Compare LXV I.54­56.Note that although only “I” is “under attack”, all three lutes are stilled. This isdue to Attachment; each function of the untrained Ahamkara reacts upon the other.23. The tempest arose, and the music of the lutes was stilled.The tempest represents either anger, fear, or some other passion, being aturbulence of Kama arisen from the sensitiveness of the Ahamkara to whatever itinterprets as an “attack” against its integrity.24. The hour passed, and the music of the lutes was stilled.“Mine” is a necessary concept only insofar as the Ahamkara must study adetermined fact to convey information to Buddhi. Any memory of th brain is a case of“Mine”. But attachment to possessions, be they of any sort, is a vice of the untrainedAhamkara. Obviously the hour must psas, that is, the Universe must flow. Nothing ispermanent in the Universe.There is an apologue, narrated if I am not mistaken by Swami Vivekananda, of ayogi who saw a raj seated by a private like in fron of his castle and loosing hisloincloth and depositing it on the steps to the castle went and bathed in the lakewithout previosly asking permision of the owner. After his bath the yogi, still naked,approached the raja nd began to upbraid him for his attachment to possissions. Atthis point both perceived that the castle had caught fire.

But Thou art Eternity and Space; Thou art Matter and Motion; and Thouart the negation of all these things.Again, resonance is the key. By concentrating on the Angel, the Adept learns howto reorganize the Ahamkara so that it will report truly and interfere not.26. For there is no Symbol of Thee.Compare LXV I.7­1127. If I say Come up upon the mountains! the celestial waters flow at my word.But thou art the Water beyond the waters.27­30. The Adept learns to control all varieties of image with present themselves,and to create any he may wish, but his Angel represents the Ideal which is his limit inthis matter. All ideas of which he may be capable are comprised in the nature of hisAngel.This point is debatable and, in my opinion, correct only relatively to each StepinInitiation. But in these matters it is Experience that counts. Let each find out forhimself. Certainly all ideas of which the Adept is capable at present are comprised inthe nature of his Angel. But human stars grow. The Angel also grows. Lee LiberA’ash, verse 16.28. The red three­angled heart hath been set up in Thy shrine; for the priestsdespised equally the shrine and the god.29. Yet all the while Thou wast hidden therein, as the Lord of Silence is hiddenin the buds of the lotus.28­29. These verses are especially obscure, and must to a certain extent so remain.For they contain an allusion to the most secret and critical issue of the Magical careerof TO MEGA OHPION. “The red three­angled heart” is the peculiar symbol of Ra­Hoor­Khuit; and the Prophet objected to accepting the Book of the Law, whichproclaims Him, as being incompatible with his Oath to attain the Knowledge andConversation of his Holy Guardian Angel. Not until nineteen years later did he fullyrealize that the Holy Guardian Angel was concealed in this symbol Ra­Hoor­Khuit.The “priests” seem here to represent the Secret Chiefs of the A∴ A∴ who executedtheir purpose of establishing the Law by means of TO MEGA OHPION in completedisregard of his personal ideas of what his Work (Shrine”) and the object of hisadoration (“god”) might be. The metaphor at the end of verse 29 reminds us that thelotus (Isis­Nature) conceals beneath it outward semblance, the secret perfections ofthe Child."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"30.

This passage, purely lyrical, requires no special comment. It asserts theultimate identity of all Ideas with the Angel, including himself, whom he recognizesas united with Him in the triune relation of Father, Ruler, and Bride­groom, thesource of his Being, the determinant of his Will, and the inspiration of his Joy and hisFertility.No passage of a Holy Book of Θελημα is “purely lyrical”.

All day I sing of Thy delight; all night I delight in Thy song.This refers to a very high grade of Initiation, which very few Adepts are as yetcapable of keeping permanently in manifestation while in the body of flesh.35. There is no other day or night than this.36. Thou art beyond the day and the night; I am Thyself, O my Maker, myMaster, my Mate!37. I am like the little red dog that sitteth upon the knees of the Unknown.The dog is the base animal nature — “red” the symbol of its energy, sensibility,and power to love.

He is, of course, Hadit. Cf. AL II.4.38. Thou hast brought me into great delight. Thou hast given me of Thy flesh toeat and of Thy blood for an offering of intoxication.The Angel replaces this attitude by full satisfaction and nourishment. It is in Himthat the Adept lives, and His life that intoxicates him.This is of course related to Chrisitan symbolism, but this symbolism muchprecedes Christianity­see The Golden Bough of Sir James Frazer, either the full orthe condensed edition authorized by the author.Actually, the relationship Angel­Adept­Scribe is one of symbiosis with fullexchange of energy between the parts.39.

So am I, O Adonai, my lord, and such are the waters of Thine intolerableEssence.45­46. The text confirms this interpretation of Initiation as equivalent to extendedpsychoanalysis.46. So am I, O Adonai, my beloved, and Thou hast burst me utterly in sunder.Again A.C.’s modesty carries away with him. Not psychoanalysis;parapsychoanalysis, maybe, since faculties of man of which psychoanalysts do noteven begin to be awre are involved in the process. Certainly, however, the analogyholds. But it is merely an analogy, else analysts will start advertising Initiation as theresult of twenty or thirty years of analysis at a hundred dollars an hour!There are three fundamental problems with psychoanalysis. First, it touches onlythe lower levels of kama and manas, and is totally unaware of the higher faculties.The only attempt we know of by a psychologist to study those faculties is Varieties ofReligious Experience by William James. It is deplorable he was not taken up bysomeone else.Second, Freud, although a genius, unfortunately did not undergo analysis­howcould he, poor fellow? Pioneers always suffer from this handicap. He neverperceived that his definition of the libido as immoral resulted from his early up­bringing in a Judeo­Christist society. His entire theory of psychoanalysis is vitiatedby the dogma of Original Sin. Marx sufferd from the same hang­up. Rare indeed isthe Jew who doesn’t. (Perhaps you can’t be a Jew if you don’t.)Third, either because of a misinterpretation of the application of statistics tobehaviorism, or because of a marxist approach to the concept of normality, modernpsychoanalysis does not try to integrate the individual within himself, but rather toadapt him to society. If the peg is square or in zigzag, chip away until it can fit theround hole­or vice­versa. A beautiful new term is indeed dancing the rounds of theintelligentsiz: sociopathy, that is, the condition of being incapable of adaptation to thestatus quo. The sheep consider it a disease. The opinion of the goats has not beenasked. After all, they are the villains of the piece.47. I am shed out like spilt blood upon the mountains; the Ravens of Dispersionhave borne me utterly away."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The life of the Ego is dispersed over all salient ideas. The ravens are the birds ofNetzach the sphere of Venus, i.e., the life of the Adept is carried away aloft byUniversal Love.Note Dispersion=333, which is a number of Binah, and note that the Guaridan ofthe Abyss is BABALON, who is a form of Venus (Her Star is seven­pointed, amongother things). Cf. Liber CLVI.4­6.48. Therefore is the seal unloosed, that guarded the Eighth abyss; therefore isthe vast sea as a veil; therefore is there a rending asunder of all things.This process leads to the full crossing of the Abyss ­ for which see Liber 418 andLiber VII.49. Yea, also verily Thou art the cool still water of the wizard fount. I havebathed in Thee, and lost me in Thy stillness.50. That which went in as a brave boy of beautiful limbs cometh forth as amaiden, as a little child for perfection.49­50. The above ideas are here repeated in another symbol. The “fount” isSalmacis (A nymph who lived in a fountain of the same name in Caria. She lovedHermaphroditus, who rejected her. He then bathed in her fountain. She seized him,praying that they might never be separated, and their bodies fused into that of ahermaphrodte. Traditionally, any man who bathes in the fountain in Caria becomeseffminate.). The positive Individuality becomes the Universal and perfect Virgin ofthe World. See again Liber 418.Also Liber VII I.49 The process of rendering asunder changes the formula of theEgo into the Formula of the Femal, and then into the Rejoicing Mother. The “babe”is of course the Babe of the Abyss, and also, of course, a form of Heru­ra­ha: Ra­Hoor­Khu. It will grow into a Master of the Temple, fed by the ‘Mother’, that is, theold complex of energies which has been, so to speak, “raped” by th Lord of Hell.There is an analogy here with the wasp that paralyzes a spider and leaves it to feedits larvae with its living flesh; but in this case the larvae are children of the wasp withthe spider. Hence the Angel is the Vampire that comes forth only at night (the Nightof Pan) to such the blood of human beings. All symbols, both the most sublime andthe most foul, have their reverse side. Indeed, without showing both sides of the coin,they can not be true above the Abyss. Thus we saw, in vv. 4­20, how the old serpent,the source of all evil, is in truth a form of the Zodiac, the girdle of our lady Nuit.51. O Thou light and delight, ravish me away into the milky ocean of the stars!52. O Thou Son of a light­transcending mother, blessed be Thy name, and theName of Thy Name, throughout the ages!51­52. A lyrical outburst on this theme. Note Nuit, and the new True Self born ofHer, not the old False Ego which is annihilated."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Of course the dissolution of the complex of energies that formed the old ego resultsin an identification of the entire being of the Adept with Nuit: See AL I.27­30, 58, 61;AL II.21, 44, 62, 72; AL III 43­45. The \"kisses of the stars\" are the impact of thedirectional energy of the True Will of those who already crossed the Abyss; thebuffeting upon the neutrally floating Smooth Point creates a Resultant falling towardthe Infinite; this Resultant is the True Will of the new Magister, who shall be reflectedbelow the Abyss as a Morning Star or an Evening Star(The above explanation is an attempt to put into astronomical language some ideawhat happens at the birth of the Babe of the Abyss; astronomical language beingclosest to pure mathematics, which the crown of the Manas, that is, the brain cellgroup that best represents the Ahamkara of the Initiate. The wise reader willunderstand the analogy must not be carried too far. But pure mathematics, is, in ouropinion, the faculty most likely to bridge the gap between Daath and Binah in thefuture evolution of mankind. We are speaking, of course, or intellectual faculties.)Thus the True Will is, at the same time, the expression of the position of theindividual star in the cosmos. Free Will and Necessity are thus One ­ nay, are None,as the next verses show.53. Behold! I am a butterfly at the Source of Creation; let me die before thehour, falling dead into thine infinite stream!The reference is to Atu XVII. The butterfly is the Neschamah (pure Ψυχη). Itsnature is that of a being separated momentarily and painlessly from Nuit.The butterfly was chosen as a symbol of Initiatic Rebirth because it is a beautifulwinged being that emerges from an ugly cocoon. Also it feeds upon the nectar offlowers (which are symbols analogous to the stars), is totally harmless and looks likea moving jewel.54. Also the stream of the stars floweth ever majestical unto the Abode; bear meaway upon the Bosom of Nuit!The stream of souls (stars) flows ever toward Nuit; i.e., each man and woman hasthe same True Will — to regain its original Mother.She is the Infinite, into which all stars are falling. Our Destination is the same.This is also the river of Amrit spoken of in LXV I.33­40. The Boat of mother­of­pearl, being a female symbol, becomes now clear. Cf. LXV III.47­50.55. This is the world of the waters of Maim; this is the bitter water thatbecometh sweet. Thou art beautiful and bitter, O golden one, O my LordAdonai, O thou Abyss of Sapphire!The above is declared to be a Mystery of the Atu XII.

The Waters beyond this duality arethe Waters of the Great Sea.The Path of Initiation has to fight the natural inertia of the flesh and the entirecomplex of energies related to animal life, passive reaction to environment, in short,everything that makes of man merely that creature that Olaf Stapledon first called“homo saps” in his brilliant and prophetic novel, Odd John. This passive resistance(it is purely automatic) seems to become active and malignant as the Aspirantprogresses. No mater where he turns, he sees a malignant corrupt face mocking him.He seemeth there is an actively malicious, fiendishly subtle Enemy ready to pounceon him at every corner. As it is written: “Thou shalt be vexed by dispersion.”In truth, it is his own effort to swim faster than his fellows that creates ripples in thetide.

In no way shall he come to the Identityof Thee!57­59. The “foolish man” is the natural man, the uninitiate. “Foolish” is empty,vain full of wind (Air = א = The Fool). He is contrasted with the “Great Fool” Atu 0,Alelph, who is the first path from Kether.(Cf. AL I.11, 31, 45, 48 and the Commentaries thereon.)Hoor­paar­kraat or Harpocrates, the “Babe in the Egg of Blue,” is not merely theGod of silence in a conventional sense. He represents the Higher Self, the HolyGuardian Angel. The connection is with the symbolism of the Dwarf in Mythology.He contains everything in Himself, but is unmanifested. See CCXX II.8. SeeCommentary to CCXX I.7This man cannot be brought to perfection, for he is composed of Qliphoth orexcrement. His emancipation is from just such parts of his being; they are not of hisessence.This is not quite correct. There is no ‘emancipation’ involved: the essence isincorrputed and incorruptible. But the Path of Initiation consists in using theqliphotic material of which common man is composed to create a “scribe”, that is,an Initiate. It would be more correct then to say that this man cannot be brought toperfection in his present state, which is but the materia prima of the Work. And hewill not undergo the painful transmutations necessary to produce the Quintessentce­the Fifth element, Akasha­the Pentagram, or the Crucified God, or the Hanged Man­unless it be his True Will.

Me doth theWoman of the Mysteries instruct in vain; I have burst the bonds of Love and ofPower and of Worship.The Adept identifies himself with this Pure Fool. He is indifferent to the Illusion ofPhenomenal existence caused by the Magician (Pekht, Extension, Atu I, Beth, 2,;Mercury Mayan). The woman of the Mysteries (Isis, Atu II, Gimel, 3, Luna) doesnot spoil his purity with her phantastic reflections of Truth. He is no more at themercy of the “The Empress” (Atu III, Daleth, 4, Venus), “The Emperor” ( Atu IV,Tzaddi, 90, Aries) and the “The Hierophant” (Atu V, Vau, 6, Taurus). That is,neither the subtle distinctions (I, II) of Truth nor their gross images (III, IV, V) injurehis perfection of Zero.Actually, it is not correct to call Daleth a “gross image” of Truth: it is entrielyabove the Abyss, and should not be confused with Netzach or even with Eros of theGreeks. It is the Emperor and the Hierophant that, crossing the Abyss, necessarilypartake of the grossness of Duality. More likely by “Love” is meant Atu VI, TheLovers. Cf. AL I.41, and the Commentaries thereon.59. Therefore is the Eagle made one with the Man, and the gallows of infamydance with the fruit of the just.It follows that the symbols of Royalty and Spirituality are now equivalent to thoseof plastic life (Aquarius and Scorpio) and vibratory manifestation.The gallows is found in Atu XII (Mem, 40, Water [Cf verse 55]), and on it issuspended, free from earth, the joyously moving ('dance') form of the extended ormanifested man (Atu VIII, Lamed, 30, Libra: the positive or expressed form of Atu 0,(Aleph, 0, Air); (Aleph and Lamed the Key of CCXX).Again, it seems to us this interpretation is unnecessarily complex. The Eagle(referred to Scorpio) and the Man are the two feminine powers of the Sphinx. Scorpiois referred to BABALON, Aquarius to NUIT (see Liber V).

Since I am InfiniteSpace, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bind nothing! Let there be nodifference made among you between any one thing and any other thing; for therebythere cometh hurt.”The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel resolves allthought into the identity of insignificance. He exists equally in the Unity of Ra­Hoor­Khuit and in every detail of phenomenal manifestation.True, but misses the point. “I have found Thee alike in the Me and the Thee,” thatis, upper case M and T, the Supernal Selves involved are identical, are one, nay, arenone. Above the Abyss there is no difference; below, there is plenty of difference. Butthis is not what is meant by the verse, anyway. Things are not Kings, or rather, Kingsare special cases of things... Cf. AL I.45, 48, 52 and the Commentaries thereon.The Many in a sense is Dispersion, and another name for Choronzon, because it isnot the All, which, of course, is perfect. Cf. LXV III.30­33.CHAPTER IVThis Chapter is attributed to Fire. It deals with the salient rays of Positive Idea,beyond any intuition to apprehend, and with the nature of the Will and the sexualenergy, the dynamic shape of the Self.Being thus actually beyond Understanding, being the Utterance of the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Unconscious, it becomes naturally impossible for even the Initiate to apprehend thechapter as it stands. It deals with the Original Unities; and it is for the Master of theTemple (the Adept in Tiphereth cannot understand the Chapter at all) to receive,interpret, bring to birth and conscious expression Their sublime gesture.It is obvious from the above the 666 has a special preference for the element offire. This is due to the Nature of the Star, and this is one of the reasons why He waschosen for Magus of an Aeon where Leo is one of the two key signs. His tremendouscapacity of organizing intellection is another, since it harmonizes him with Aquarius,the other key sign.Another Adept might have identified another Chaper more specially with theUnconscious, and produced a different type of work (LXV I.2­10). Nevertheless,since this is the Aeon of Aquarius­Leo, his bias makes His words even more useful tous. In a sense, this Chapter is an Adumbration of the Aeon in the HumanConsciousness of the Initiate.1. O crystal heart! I the Serpent clasp Thee; I drive home mine head into thecentral core of Thee, O God my beloved.1­10. This section is the address of the Angel. He explains His Knowledge andConversation from His own standpoint. The aspiration towards Him is masculine. Atthe moment of achievement it is replaced by passivity as explained in previouschapters. The aspiration has its parallel in the will of the Angel to communicate. Butthis will is superficially of a different character. Its nature is now explained.1. He calls the Adept “Crystal heart” implying that he is a concentration of light,energy, love, lucidity, and purity. It is these qualities in the Adept with which hecommunicates. This is the object of the preparation. The Adept must present thisimage perfectly before the Knowledge and Conversation can operate. That is,purification and consecration must precede invocation. It is extremely difficult evenfor a Master of the Temple even after years of contemplation to get it firmly into hisconsciousness that his material part is not he at all any more than any other collectionof phenomena. The Angel describes Himself as the serpent. The serpent is, of coursethe symbol of wisdom, immortality, royalty, and other similar qualities. The Angelnot only winds himself about the heart of the Adept but drives His head into thecentre. He addresses the Adept as “God my beloved” obviously any member of sohigh an order of being has long assimilated the truth of Pantheism.The Angel identifies Himself with Kundalini, that is, with the vital­fiery­spiritualforce of the linga­sharira, and activates this force to the level at which Hadit becomesmanifest in His charge: “I drive home mine head into the central core of Thee”. It isagain that phenomenon of resonance of which we have spoken before. The seriousstudent will remember, of course, that Kundalini is a female force to the Hindus. Nuand Hu are complemental and exist in each other.2.

She is here the symbol of the Angel as represented by the Pathof Gimel where is “The High Priestess.” This Path connects Macroprosopus (Kether)and Microprospus (Tiphereth), the supreme divinity and its human manifestation. TheSun is attributed to Tiphereth and so symbolizes the Adept. The Angel thinks ofHimself as “plunging into the wet heart of the Creation,” i.e., the reflection in matterof the True Self of the Adept whom He loves.3. There is a beauty unspeakable in this heart of corruption, where the flowersare aflame.The Angel finds beauty in “this heart of corruption” by which he means the life ofmutability. “The flowers are aflame.” Phenomena blossom and enkindle, i.e., touch.4. Ah me! but the thirst of Thy joy parches up this throat, so that I cannot sing.The intensity of the passion of the Angel is so great that He cannot express it evenin music.5. I will make me a little boat of my tongue, and explore the unknown rivers. Itmay be that the everlasting salt may turn to sweetness, and that my life may beno longer athirst.The boat is here the symbol of consciousness, as in II:7­16. The tongue is theLogos of the Angel, and the unknown rivers new spheres of thought. The everlastingsalt is the sorrow which tinctures the great sea of Binah, and the hopes by the abovemethod to transcend the Trance of Sorrow in reference to all these possibilities.Of course the Angel, as such, has already transcended such a simple Trance asthat of Sorrow. But as here He identifies Himself with the Adept in love, He partakesof the sitation of the Beloved, as all true lovers do. For this motive, if no other, lovemust be under will, else we trun from our way, or turn someone else from his or hers.The exception to this rule is a lower form of being, which can only benefit by ourlove, be this expressed sexually, or in a relationship of master and pet, orgastronomincally. This, by the way, is the triple relation Angel­Adept. It parallelsvery well, on a much higher plane of course, the relation man­dog, or the rleationman­female animal (or vice­versa), or the relation obese citizen­fried chicken.

Water is a symbol of pleasure, and desire is impregnated withsorrow. To act in this way maddens the deluded race of men. He bids them “Comeup through the creeks,” i.e., the narrow passages of thought, the concentrated currentsof thought which lead to pure pleasure — “the fresh water.” When men succeed intravelling by means of controlled will to true pure pleasure they find him waiting toadminister the Sacrament.Creeks means very small streams of water, hence not thought is meant here, butclean remifications of desire, which come from the fresh water, and taken counter­current­‘come up through the creks’­lead unto it.

Hence the immediate identification with‘narrow passages of thought’, denying that desire itself could lead to the pure water,the fresh water. This ‘fresh water’ is, of course, that ‘fountain of living water’ thatChristists spoke so much, and did so little, about.7. As the bezoar­stone that is found in the belly of the cow, so is my lover amonglovers.7­8. The bezoar­stone is a ball composed chiefly of hairs which represent closely­woven forces. He compares the Adept to this stone seeing him as a complex ofdiverse energies. The limbs of the Adept are the instruments of his activity. TheAngel invites him to repose with Him in the orchard, i.e., in the place where naturalprocesses have culminated in fructifying. The cool grass seems to be a symbol ofvegetative life, and the Angel proposes to use this evergreen freshness of Nature asthe field for rejoicing and nourishment. He calls to the slaves, that is, to theinstruments of action, controlled any put to use to bring wine, i.e., to furnish themeans of ecstasy, for He wishes the Adept to be enkindled with rapture and manifestits glow in his face, i.e., his outer consciousness.This is related with ‘coming up through the creeks to the fresh water’: it describesthe results­or some of the reults­of having done so. The image of the ‘bezoar­stone’ isextremely important to all those who desire to reach Adeptship. For, of course, theAdept is this: a comlex of energy­fluxes integreated and harmonized around a centralcore. (The analogy with the “atom” so­called is obvious.)8. O honey boy! Bring me Thy cool limbs hither! Let us sit awhile in theorchard, until the sun go down! Let us feast on the cool grass! Bring wine, yeslaves, that the cheeks of my boy may flush red.‘Honey boy’ is a symbol equivalent to that of ‘bezoar­stone’, or rather, theycomplement each other closely.

Make Thy"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"mouth an opium­poppy, that one kiss is the key to the infinite sleep and lucid,the sleep of Shi­loh­am.A garden usually symbolizes a place of cultivated beauty; Oriental poets use it toexpress a collection of poems or wise sayings. The immortal kisses are the tokens ofthe operation of “love under will” which is perpetual. The Angel calls upon theAdept to display his brilliance as if the Knowledge and Conversation were atranscendental sacrament beyond that implied in all acts. The opium poppy is asymbol of peace, exaltation, and delight, the giver of sleep, by which is meant thesilencing of all possible distractions. The mouth of the Adept, the organ by which heis nourished, expresses his thoughts, and symbolizes his passions; by the kiss of thismouth is meant its surrender to the Angel, the act of marriage, and this is the key tothe infinite sleep and lucid. Sleep has been explained above. It is infinite, being freedfrom the limitations of condition, and lucid as being characterized by pure vision.Shi­loh­am: the word means peace.ש = Fire, ♎ = למ = Water :✡.People are so accustomed to read about occultism, and to find the mostpreposterous claims turn to nothing in face of the behavior or the ineffectualness ofthe writers on “great mysteries” and “transcendental methods” and “illuminatedavatars” that they tend to discount everyting. And they do well. Let it be stated thenthat nothing the A∴ A∴ writes about is illusion: everyting can be tested by yourself,and you can be your own witness. This writer has experienced the Knowledge andConversation of his Angel; this writer has experienced the Sleep of Shi­loh­am; thiswriter has crossed the Abyss and this writer has beome a Magister Templi followingthe discipline and the rules ofhte A∴ A∴. There is not a word in “One Star in Sight”(BOOK FOUR, Part III, pp. 229­244), the Manifesto of the A∴ A∴, which is a lie oran exaggeration: Our method is that of Science, and Our experiments can be verifiedby those brave enough, persistent enough, and sincere enough to want to test themand Us.10. In my sleep I beheld the Universe like a clear crystal without one speck.The Angel explains that (in the reposeful ecstasy of love, I might even say in theorgasm of love, the reference is to the particular Samadhi of the attainment of theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel) in his “sleep” heobtained the vision of the Universe as a continuous and immaculate phenomenon.This is contrasted implicitly with the effect of the same act on the Adept, to whom itsimply means union with Godhead. The Angel has found perfection in his ownAdept: this completes Perfection."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"11. There are purse­proud penniless ones that stand at the door of the tavernand prate of their feats of wine­bibbing.11­14. The Adept now speaks, or rather, the Master of the Temple speaks.11. The tavern is the temple of spiritual intoxication. Without it are the BlackBrothers boasting of their own attainments.The expression “black brothers” is, unfortunately, very misleading. It is used by usbecause there is simply no word extant to describe the parapsychological state of aperson who undergoes the particular symdrome so badly described by that name.(There exists the Black School of Magick, which has nothing to do with these “blackbrothers”.) They are also sometimes called “brothers of the left­hand path”, which iseven more misleading. “Brothers of the left­hand path” were the Tantrists, who usedwomen in their mystical rites, activating the left­hand path of the spinal column. Theywere piously decried in Tibet and India by “brothers of the right­hand path”, that is,those who followed the path of pederasty (pretending, like Roman priests and monksand nuns, to abstain) in their rites. De gustibus non est disputandum, butunfortunately the pedants will dispute anyway. (Cf. AL I.57.)Readers should therfore avoid attaching any idea of racial slur (the Black Schoolof Magick is connected with the racial strain of the same color, but no the “blackbrothers”, who can be of any skin color, and most of the time are white) or ofmystical method to the idea of the “black brothers”. It is to be hoped that during thisAeon of Horus, with the increase of awareness, a clinical name will be found for thisparapsychopathological condition that will not evoke false associations to mind.Acutally, the blackest are the shiniest! Cf. LXV I.18­22 and the Commentariesthereon.12. There are purse­proud penniless ones that stand at the door of the tavernand revile the guests.They are purse­proud, i.e., mean and selfish, yet penniless, i.e., their attainmentsare worthless. They also revile those who have attained the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: the Black Brother for all his arrogance isaware like Klingsor of his real condition, and he therefore blasphemes the WhiteLodge.A.C. considered the “Black Lodge” simply a corruption fo the White School ofMagick. We are inclined to make the membership a little more extensive than that,but each Adept must decide on this question by his or her own experience.13.

This may mean that theyhave passed beyond the stage where the act is unique with one such as described in"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"vv. 8­9. The foolish man: see II:37. Noise is a symbol of distraction and lack ofharmony. It is “hidden from them” — a stronger phrase than “unheard by them.”14. Only the inn­keeper feareth lest the favour of the king be withdrawn fromhim.The innkeeper is the Guardian of the Mysteries, and the king the Authority bywhich men’s lives are governed. It is his business to protect the guests from thearrogance of the Black Brothers, but also to prevent their malice from making thesacrament unlawful. (Levi has a passage on this point. He says that when thearcanum was divulged in the time of the French Revolution it became impossible toput it into practice. The adepts consequently quarreled among themselves and chaosresulted. We must not suppose that this is a mere matter of the vow of secrecy. Nordoes it imply that the publication of the means of attainment may lead to disaster. It isthe fourth power of the Sphinx which was somehow lost.) It seems strange that theMagister in the midst of his rapture with the allocution of his Angel yet ringing in hisears should find nothing less incongruous in reply. The difficulty is easily explained.For one thing his ecstasy is ineffable. For another, it is perfect, so that he cannotpossibly speak about it. Thirdly, he is aware that part of the price of his attainment ishis responsibility as Guardian of the Mysteries. He therefore calls the attention of hisAngel to what I may describe as the political situation.On the question of Levi, and the vow of secrecy, and the revelation of arcana: truearcana cannot be divulged, because perception of them depends on living with them,experiencing them, their problems, their technicalities, the success and failure in theiapplication, which comes only with long practice. See LXV V.48­57. The old O.T.O.made a great hullabaloo over the simple fact of sexual magick, known all over theFar East for centuries, and capitalized on it in the ignorant West. When AleisterCrowley discovered the “Secret” by his own genius (and his Magickal Memory) andpublished it openly (as true scientists do about their discoveries), the Outer Head ofthe O.T.O. came running in from Germany and conned him into taking the O.T.O.“vow of secrecy”. Crowley, who when young could not resist a title, fell for it. Whenhe repented, years later, he was already bound. It became necessary therefore toreorganize the O.T.O. according to Thelemic principles. In order that this be done,rituals and “secrets” have been openly published by instruments of the “blackbrothers”, who think, very naively as usual, that they are “destroying” the Order.Everybody with the slightest degree of intelligence and a modicum of scholarship cannow perceive whtat the “secret of the IX° Degree” was, and some are stupid enough(one of them even likes to pass himself for the Outer Head, having been expelledfrom the Sanctuary for indiscipline many years ago!) to believe they know the “scretof the XI° Degree”. In point of fact, these indiviuals who try the “secret” in practiceare not, as a rule, even capable of “drinking damnation unto themselves”. It is notenough to know that when you pull the trigger a gun shoots; it is still necessary tomake sure that the gun is in good repair, properly loaded, and to know here, when,and how to aim."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"What happened at the time of the French Revolution was that the theory of the“arcanum” (whatever this arcanum was at the time) was openly given, but thepractice of the arcanum in the lower levels became clogged by the telepathicinterference of a mob of would­be adepts clamoring for this or that gewgaw that theymistook for the jewels of the Sanctuary. The Fourth Power of the Sphinx had notbeen lost, or even diminished, since the Adepts responsible for that Revolution, whichwas the mother of every nation at present existing on the Eastern Hemisphere, and ofmany existing in the Western, not only wielded their power, but also worked terriblyand skillfully through the nightmare of blood and madness. Cagliostro and “St.Germain”, among others, although “St. Germain”, who is now quite dead, onlyworked in the preparation, while Cagliostro was chiefly responsible, with his Master“Althotas”, for the conflagration itself.15. Thus spake the Magister V.V.V.V.V. unto Adonai his God, as they playedtogether in the starlight over against the deep black pool that is in the HolyPlace of the Holy House beneath the Altar of the Holiest One.15­21: The above peculiarity of the previous dialogue is the subject of part of thispassage. Generally it discusses the question of the relations between certain powers ofNature.15: The circumstances of the dialogue are carefully explained. He is the Master ofthe Temple, V.V.V.V.V., not merely the Adept, who has simply attained union. TheAngel is moreover identified specifically with the symbol of Adonai. They areplaying together, i.e., in conscious communion; in the starlight, i.e., in the presence ofNuit; and the place of their meeting is the “deep black pool” symbolic of Binah, thesphere of the sorrow of Motherhood, the place of conception and the abodeofUnderstanding. The holy place is the three first Sephiroth, i.e., above the Abyss. Theholy house is the Tree of Life. And the Altar of the holiest one is Kether.16. But Adonai laughed, and played more languidly.Adonai replies to the passage, vv. 11­14, by simply changing the rhythm of hismusic to a more languid measure. In this way he implies that there is no need forhaste or anxiety17. Then the scribe took note, and was glad. But Adonai had no fear of theMagician and his play. For it was Adonai who had taught all his tricks to theMagician.The scribe who is the conscious human being charged to report these mattersunderstands by this that all is well. The Magician is Atu I, Mayan (see II:58) and thereferences in Liber 418. The Angel has no fear that the forces of illusion can everinterfere with the Great Work. He is himself Macroprosopus. This phrase needsexplanation. Just as a man aspires to the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel and attains it, so too does the Angel aspire to the “unity uttermostshowed;” for his position is the Path of Gimel. In his attainment he has therefore"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"reached Kether, from which spring not only his own Path Gimel (leading toTiphereth) but that of Beth (leading to Binah). To understand properly the full natureof Binah we must remember this point. The sorrow connected with the idea of thisSephira is due to the fact that she is the recipient of the original illusion. There is nosorrow in the other current, the Path of Daleth through which her lord communicateshis essence.In this qabalistic explanation there occurs a very subtle confusion between theAngel that is growing, Babe of the Abyss, inside the Adept, and the Holy GuardianAngel itself. The H.G.A. is not in Gimel; Gimel simply represents the path thatdirectly connects Kether to Tiphareth. It is natural that the Angel should theremanifest His­Her­Its vibration, quickening the perceptions of the Adept until the latteris able to glow of his own light, but the Angel is equally present in very path of thTree, in every Sephira, and He­She­It is identified, or rather, identifies himself­herself­itself with the Trinity Heru­ra­ha­Nuit­Hadit right at the beginning of LXV.The Master of the Temple will, eventually, become a H.G.A. Himself (see TheWake World in KONX OM PAX), but it is he, as a human being, who aspires to the‘unity uttermost showed’ (Heru­ra­ha). The Angel, being at least an Ipsissimus, isalready identical to that Essence in His own Essence, though differing inmanifestation. It is useless for us to try to explain more clearly what cannot beexpressed clearly through the intellect. We refer readers to AL I.45 and AL I.52 onceagain.It must be kept in mind that the Qabalah is an ingenious and to a great extenthighly efficient attempt to create a set of symbols capable of transmitting Neschamicinformation (Buddhi movements) through Ruach (Manas). Its letters and numbersare not things in themselves; we tend to think of them as such because of our longfamiliarity with their use, but we must avoid this pitfall, which is the pitfall oftheology. There perished the overwhelming majority of Jewish qabalists. It is the pitcalled Because in AL II.27. The materialization of symbols has always been the birthof religions (and consquent fanaticism) and the death of theurgy.The sorrow connected with the idea of Binah exists only for those who are in thegrasp of the ‘old serpent’ of Cap. III 4­20. They lament the loss of desire, but this isanimal desire. Binah is described either as an arid desert full of rocks and nakedmountains, or as a black sea. Only those who have become truly human dare livethere. Cf. LXV V.60­63.18. And the Magister entered into the play of the Magician. When the Magicianlaughed he laughed; all as a man should do.The Magister whose abode is Binah now uses illusion itself as a means ofenjoyment. He behaves naturally like a child without fear that there may be somesinister significance in the operations of Nature.He follows the Way of the Tao, that is, he lives according to AL I.44. Tounderstand this it is necessary to study Liber II and to practice Liber NV.One word on the Magician. The “black brothers” would like to reach Chokhmah"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"without having to pass through Binah; they would like to wield power withoutsurrendering self. The Magus of the Aeon therefore manifests in the path of Beth intheir consciousness and, as it is written, confounds their understanding. Thisoperation is purely automatic. The Magus is exerting his power by doing his Will,that is, vibrating his Word. Should the “black brethren” swim with the tide, the Wordwould be a beacon to their Annihilation­Binah. By rebelling, they create counter­currents in their own consciousness. They become incapable of spirtualunderstanding, because their path of Beth vibrates inharmoniously, being turnedagainst the Word of the Magus. Thus does He then send forth Illusion and Falsehoodto enslave their souls. It is His curse. He would rather explain things to them kindly,and He does; but they will not hear, and as a result the words are transformed intheir consciousness into the image of their own inmost greed­which is also theirinmost fear. Thus works the Ahamkara.The same mechanism works with common human beings everywhere, but not sointensely. To escape the slavery of the Magician it is enough to do your True Will. Itis as simple as that. And as difficult!...For the slaves will not; they know not how towill. Cf. VII VII.36­3919. And Adonai said: Thou art enmeshed in the web of the Magician. This Hesaid subtly, to try him.To test him the Angel suggests that his enjoyment of illusion is identical with thatof the profane.20. But the Magister gave the sign of the Magistry, and laughed back on Him: OLord, O beloved, did these fingers relax on Thy curls, or these eyes turn awayfrom Thine eye?The Magister replies that although apparently enjoying the good things of life (soto speak) he has never for one instant forgotten that he is enjoying the love of hisAngel. Neither by action of the fingers which grasp the curls or spiral energies of theAngel, nor by loss of concentration upon the eye (symbol of sight, creative energy,unity, etc. See also “Eye of Horus”) of his lover did he fall from the summit of hisSamadhi. The Magister is therefore shown as perfectly initiated: he deliberatelyembraced the terrible illusion which is the source of all sorrow, and made it partintegrally of the Great Work. There being no other direction from which misfortunemight touch him, since he is protected by the Guardians of the Abyss from theinterference of the Paths of Zayin and Cheth, he is henceforth immune.This does not mean that the Magister cannot fail; it merely means that he can nolonger fail through these faults. Similarly, once a child learns to walk, it cannot failfrom walking, and it is safe from the problems of a child that does not know how towalk. This does not mean that the child may not beocme incapable of walking forsome reason. But this reason shall be extraneous to its newly acquired faculty ofwalking.Impossibility of failure means inevitability of success, and spells tedium. “It is pure"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"chance that rules the Unvierse; therefore, and only therefore, life is good.”21.

The Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel represents the descent of the element Spiritinto the midst of his being, according to the regular formula of the formation of thePentagram IHShVH from IHVH. The chief difficulty of interpretation lies in thecomplication introduced by the Equinox of the Gods.vv. 22­27 describes this Event.28­29 describes the state of the scribe.30­32 describes the preparation of the scribe for his Attainment.33­37 describes the Threshold of his Initiation.38­41 describes the Initiation itself.42­44 describes the Understanding thereby given of the necessary relations ofSpirit and Matter.45­53 describes the results of Initiation.54­56 brings together the Attainment and the Equinox of the Gods.57­60 answers the question thus propounded.61­65 a prophecy concerning the future of the individual scribe, thecircumstances in which he shall come to the Perfection of his Attainment.Readers may ask why pay so much attention to Aleister Crowley’s personalattainment? The explanation is in LXV I.33­40 and the Commentaries thereon. Whaton a certain plane is the Initiation of an Adept on another plane is his effect onmankind. 666 being the Christ of the Aeon of Horus, the importance of his initiationin general becomes evident.23. I who was the priestess of Ahathoor rejoice in your love. Arise, O Nile­God,and devour the holy place of the Cow of Heaven!

He calls upon the forces of the Nile and of Sebek the crocodile that is dwellerthereof. They are to put an end to the regimen of the Mother (Aeon of Isis).This is incorrect. The verse, and the following, indicate the Magickal currents atwork in the passage from the last Aeon to the present Aeon, beginning with therecollection of the present situation of Philae (which was imperilled by the AswanDam).

In the same way Sebek shows himself more powerful that all the“good” gods, in particular Osiris, whose enemy he is. In short, when it is time for atransition, the change is catastrophic, to all appearances; the “evil powers”­whichbourgeois mentality throughout the ages always equates with change, and even moreso does peasant mentality­suddenly prove themselves more powerful than the “goodones”. All words and signs that “banished” or “restricted” them become inoperant.To the theologic mentality, as to the bourgeois and peasant mentality, this meanschaos.25. For Thou art He! Yea, Thou shalt swallow up Asi and Asar, and thechildren of Ptah. Thou shalt pour forth a flood of poison to destroy the works ofthe Magician. Only the Destroyer shall devour Thee; Thou shalt blacken histhroat, wherein his spirit abideth. Ah, serpent Apep, but I love Thee!AIWASS (identified with the Holy Guardian Angel of Aleister Crowley) is todestroy the formulae of Isis and Osiris (Aeon of the Dying God). There is here areference to the Legend of Shiva who drank up the poison caused by the churning ofthe “Milk of the Stars” or manifestation of Phenomenal Existence. His throat becameblack (or indigo blue) as a result. AIWAZ has thus turned Apophis against himself, tomake way for the Aeon of Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child. Apophisloved; i.e., vanishes in ecstasy at the caress of AIWAZ the “mighty serpent” of verse26 (the throat is the seat of the element of Spirit ­ Akasha dwells in the VisuddhiCakkram). The meaning is that the formula given by AIWAZ destroys the idea ofDestruction as such. What was until now called “Death.” the means of resurrection inthe Formula of Osiris IAO, is to be understood henceforth as “love under will.”That is, as Change (see Little essays on Love). There are several inaccuracies inthe above paragraph. The verse identifies Apep with He, the Unknown God, Ra,ofwhom all other gods are merely viceroys throughout the Aeons. (This does notmean that Apep is the Unknown God; it means that this apparently malignant force­Apep was as feared by the Egyptians as the “devil” was feared by the Christists­isalso a divine force, also partakes of the Essence of Ra. This is the explanation of itssudden power to defeat all the other gods.) The scribe understands this, and lovesApep, identifying him, righrtly, with his own H.G.A., (Cf. LXV III.30­31) Of all thegods ‘attacked’ by the poison of the “Evil One” only Shiva, the destroyer, shallsurvive the attack; but his throat shall be ‘blackened’ by the influence of the poison ofApep. This means, of couxrse, that Shiva is one of the influences that will hold swayin the Aeon of Horus (Cf. ‘The Spiritual Name of Aleister Crowley in the HinduTradition’, as given in Eight Lectures on Yoga); but the interpretation of the power of"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"thismember of the Trimuti­the Sanatanas­shall be influenced by Our concept of theElement of Spirit, which foolish Brahmins and Yogis know is the original concept oftheir own Tradition, but which for laziness, or fear, or malice, they have modified inthe last few centuries. Cf. LXV I.12­19.26. My God! Let Thy secret fang pierce to the marrow of the little secret bonethat I have kept against the Day of Vengeance of Hoor­Ra. Let Kheph­Rasound his sharded drone! let the jackals of Day and Night howl in thewilderness of Time! let the Towers of the Universe totter, and the guardianshasten away! For my Lord hath revealed Himself as a mighty serpent, and myheart is the blood of His body.This Day of Vengeance is the Aeon of Horus — beginning with the SpringEquinox of 1904 E.V. (Note CCXX III:3 and the Avenger.) The “little secret bone”is found in the Phallus of the Bear. (Hebrew 6 = דב). This is an anatomical fact. TheBear is symbolic of part of TO MEGA OHPION 666 according to the descriptiongiven of Him in the Apocalypse:I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon hishorns ten crowns, and upon his hands the name of blasphemy.And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet ofa bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, andhis seat, and great authority.And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly woundwas healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast; and theyworshipped the beast, saying Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make warwith him?And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, andpower was given unto him to continue forty and two months.And he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, andhis tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: andpower was given him over all kindreds, and tongues and nations.And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not writtenin the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.If any man have an ear, let him hear.He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the swordmust be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth: and he had two horns like alamb, and he spake as a dragon.And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earthand all which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"healed.And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven onthe earth in the sight of men.And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles whichhe had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth,that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, anddid live.And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of thebeast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image ofthe beast should be killed.And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive amark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of thebeast, or the number of his name.Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: forit is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. (Rev:Cap: XIII.)We have copied this piece of nonsense because it is part of the originalcommentary by A.C.. Nevertheless, we refer students to ‘Liber 418’ for informationon the nature of “Revelations” and the worth of its contents, which is minimal. A.C.was so obsessed by this piece of trash that he prepared certain regulations andprocedures of the O.T.O. to comply with parts of the prophecies of the lazy, cruel,sly, mad Church Fathers responsible for this idiocy.We continue with his Commentary.This bone is consequently the Quintessential Individuality of the Unconscious ofAleister Crowley; he having retained his human personality in order to serve as theInstrument of the Logos of this Aeon. He now demands that the “fang”(Tooth=ש=Spirit) of his Angel shall penetrate to his inmost self.“He having retained his human personality in order to serve as the Instrument ofthe Logos ofthis Aeon”: This sort of apology for the existence of self must stop oncefor all. The Adept whom we may call PERDURABO was born as a man AleisterCrowley on this planet. The purpose of his incarnation was to reach the Grade ofMagus. He first reached the Grade of Magister Templi, which he had reached beforein previous existences, but never on all planes. Then he reached the Grade of Magussufficiently perfectly that the consequence of his Initiation was the Passage of theAeons.The Logos of the Aeon is that Magickal Being who was incarnated as AleisterCrowley. Human personalities are retained as long as we are regularly incarnatedon this planet, the Grade of Ipsissimus being the highest that we can be aware ofwhile so. It is not that we cannot be higher than Ipsissimi while in a body of flesh. It issimly that our physical brain will retain no memory of any experience that we mayhave above that plane while incarnated. From a practical point of view, from the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"point of view of material life, this is the same as not being able to have the spiritualexperiences corresponding. Also, it does not follow that the Grade of Ipsissimus willstill be the last of which we can have conscious incarnated awareness a hundredthousand, or even ten thousand, years from now. Evolution consists in beingconscious of more on all planes all the time, and of being able to correlate moreplanes and more consciousness all the time.We must stop once for all with that nauseating nastiness of Theosophists andIllumnates of the Master Joe Doe or the Master Kilroy incarnating themselves inpoor little me or you out of their infinte mercy for mankind, who deserve theircompassion so little. We are the cream of the crop on this planet, and whateverincarnates is Us­and not someone else. There is no God where any human being is.A.C., knowing the brutishness characteristic of the existing religions, aware of thefalse humility and utter hypocrisy instilled by them, felt sufficiently apologetical aboutreaching Godhead to evade the issue. We, heirs of his experience, are not under thesame compunction. We refer the reader to LXV V.23­26. Aleister Crowley was notthe tool of 666. He was 666 Himself.And he continues being 666 Himself. Only, now there is no more Aleister Crowley,except that which was assumed into the Highest. And this is the Ascension of whichthe Christists cackled so much, and about which they did so little in the age of theirsickly power.We continue with A.C.’s Commentary:Khephra, the Scarabaeus Beetle, is the Sun at midnight. He appears in Atu XVIII(The Moon, referred to Pisces in the Zodiac) at the bottom of the hieroglyph, in apool (the firmament of the Nadir). Above this is a path leading between twomountains crowned by towers. Beneath the Moon symbolic of glamour and illusionas opposed to the Moon of the Path of Gimel symbolic of Purity, Aspiration, etc.,where goes the Holy Guardian Angel. This Path is guarded by two dogs or jackalssymbolic of Anubis, guarder of the Threshold (see verse 34). The meaning of theverse is thus that AIWAZ (revealed “as a mighty serpent” — see above) hasdestroyed the principle of illusion. In particular, the belief of man that he is mortal(Osiris) must yield to the consciousness that he is the Crowned Child (Horus). My“heart” — i.e. the human will and consciousness of Aleister Crowley is identifiedwith the essence of the life of AIWAZ (the blood of His body is used by Him as thephysical basis of His manifestation in CCXX).27. I am like a love­sick courtesan of Corinth. I have toyed with kings andcaptains, and made them my slaves. To­day I am the slave of the little asp ofdeath; and who shall loosen our love?Aleister Crowley has abandoned all his personal ambitions to “die” at the caress ofAIWAZ in His function as his Holy Guardian Angel. (The little Microcosmic “littleasp” as opposed to the “mighty serpent” who is responsible for the MacrocosmicEvent the Equinox of the Gods). The images of the love­sick courtesan and ofCleopatra show the implication of the Nephesch or “animal soul” of Aleister Crowley"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"in this matter.Yet the entire verse may be connected with the memory of a past incarnation: itwas fashionable among women for while, even before Cleopatra, to commit suicidein this manner. It could well then be another instance of a ‘ripple of His hair’.28. Weary, weary! saith the scribe, who shall lead me to the sight of the Raptureof my master?The scribe confesses the utter weariness of his human consciousness so far as it isdivorced from communion with the rapture of the Adept (“my master”) who controlshim.This explanation is again inadequte and incorrectly termed. The scribe would liketo become conscious of the Rapture of that part of his consciousness which functionin Binah (not the ‘Adept’ consciousness in Tiphereth), but finds no way of doing so.This and the next verse complement themselves in description of the mental andphysical state involved. The weariness is not exactly physical: when you come out ofTrance, you find that you are not muscularly tired, nor in need of physical sleep. Butwhile seeking to attune, you are conscious of thisextraordinary feeling of lassitude. Itwould be easy to speculate as to the cause; perhaps the prana energies of the lingasharira are being assumed into the culmination of nerve­brain cell­subtler energylinkage that makes contact between Neschamah and the Higher Ruach possible(Buddhi and Buddhi­Manas, in Hindu nomenclature). The description is remarkablyapt in every detail, and it is to hoped that future experimenters will be able toestablish what the problem really is. Perhaps it is akin to overload in an electriccircuit. It eventually vanishes, or at least it did so in the case of this writer, whoexperienced it during his Neophyte initiation. Perhaps the circuitry becamestrengthened by use?29. The body is weary and the soul is sore weary and sleep weighs down theireyelids; yet ever abides the sure consciousness of ecstacy, unknown, yet knownin that its being is certain. O Lord, be my helper, and bring me to the bliss of theBeloved!The “soul” means Nephesch. The scribe is supported, even in his consciousweariness, by the certainty of his “Unconscious” that he has come to his Attainment,despite his human conscious forgetfulness of the fact. He appeals to the Angel toflood the human consciousness with the “Bliss of the Beloved,” as heretoforeexpressed in this Book.30. I came to the house of the Beloved, and the wine was like fire that flieth withgreen wings through the world of waters.This is granted: the human consciousness enters into the pleasure­house ofAdeptship. The wine of spiritual rapture which intoxicates him is likened to “fire thatflieth” (Shin) “with green wings” (Daleth, Love) “through the world of waters”"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"(Mem). Previous passages should enable the aspirant to understand this symbolismquite thoroughly. שמ is in the Qabalah “The Name” and “Heaven”; שר means“Almighty Power,” and דמ means “Blood.” These symbols thus explain the text indetail.We call the attention of Alchemists and Brothers of the O.T.O. to the fact that thewine, which is another name for the Elixir, was like fire that ‘flies with green wings’(moves through the Air, or has the Power of Air, since it flies) through ‘the world ofwaters’. Thus ‘wine’ is a harmony, or Quintessence, of the Four Elements into aFifth State (Akasha), obtained through Love (green, the color of Daleth). A.C.’sexplanation then becomes clearer and complements this one aptly.Unless you come to the house of the Beloved,your best efforts to produce theElixir, or the Wine of the Sabbath, will be in vain. Let this be a warning to theprofane, but hlet them also remember that in the Aeon of Horus the catastrophicdisasters that followed experimentation along these lines by the uninitiate are at anend. The Forces of the Aeon are harmonic with any serious, or sincere, or naïve, orspontaneous attempt to produce the Elixir.Only those who would profane it by use against the True Will must beware.31. I felt the red lips of nature and the black lips of perfection. Like sisters theyfondled me their little brother; they decked me out as a bride; they mounted mefor Thy bridal chamber.Nature and perfection are Isis and Nephthys, who prepare Osiris (see Papyrus ofAni and The Book of the Dead generally) for Initiation. The Candidate is hererepresented as their brother (Aleister Crowley is Vau of IHVH, “the stone,” thehuman consciousness in Tiphereth — male) but decked out as a bride (for he issymbolically feminine towards his Holy Guardian Angel, the Heart about to meet theEmbrace of the Serpent. (See, too, Cap. III:49­50 [Crowley made the followingobservation in his diary for May 4, 1906: “Indeed, this work of Augoeides requiresthe Adept to assume the woman’s part: to long for her bridegroom, it may be, and tobe ever ready to receive his kiss; but not to pursue openly and to use as it were force.Yet the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence­Matt. 11:12­ may it not be, though,that such violence should be used in order to attain that passive state? And of course,to shut out all rivals?”]).We must make a remark for the benefit of Probationers and would beProbationers. The expression ‘human consciousness in Tiphereth’ is misleading.Tiphereth is the focal point of Hindu Buddhi­Manas; it is totally above humanconsciousness as this is experienced by the average brain.The difference between the brain of the Initiate and brain of the profane is that theInitiate’s brain can remember Trance, or even be conscious of it while it ishappening. We do not know if careful examination of the brain of an Adept wouldshow any anatomic or physiological difference from a profane’s brain. We suspectthat present experiments with so­called ‘aura photography’ initiated by the Russianswill eventually provide the first scientific means to identify parapsychological states"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and their reaction on the brain.What is important is that Probationers should not confuse Tiphereth­consciousnesswith brain­memory of Tiphereth states. The central experience of the Grade ofNeophyte (and the obtaining of this experience is the sign that the Probationerreached Initiation in the Order) is the Vision of the Holy Guardian Angel. This Visionmust not be confused with the Operation described in Liber VIII: it is not theKnowledge and Conversation, but a much more elementary contact. Every singleInitiation, or passage through the Grades, provides a renewal of contact with theAngel, each time more intense and more expanded.If the Neophyte (ex­Probationer) becomes convinced that he (or she) obtained theK. and C., he stops working towards the Grade of zelator, and becomes sure that heis an Adeptus Minor (to say the least!...). He can then become not only verydangerous to those below him, but something of a drag to his colleagues, as well aspathetically ridiculous to those of higher grades than himself, be they A∴ A∴ or not.The Key to Initiation consists in never to become satisfied with whatever you haveachieved up to now, no matter how sublime it may seem to you. Of course, you areoccasionally exhausted by an Initiation, and must spend years recharging while youconsolidate the ground already reached. But you should not lose sight of Aspirationbecause of that. As The Wake World makes abundantly clear, you must kiss yourAngel again and again. Cf. AL II.69­72. It must also be remarked that A.C.’sattribution of the Atman to Kether is incorrect; Atman is attributed to Chokhmah.The Plane of Consciousness corresponding to Kether is Nirvana, or Nibbana. TheLower Manas corresponds to Netzach, Hod, and has its crown in Tiphereth (AdeptusMinor Within). Buddhi corresponds to Binah, and the Ahamkara to Daath.The excessive importance attributed to Atman by the Brahmins is an example ofthat laziness we mentioned a while ago in talking of Neophytes who think they areAdepts, although on a higher plane. Actually, Atman, as understood by mostBrahmins, is nothing but a figment of the Ahamkara. Cf. VII IV.50­5332. They fled away at Thy coming; I was alone before Thee.The Ego is deprived of its attributes before it can receive the impact of the HolyGuardian Angel. It must be the pure Human Self as an Individual independent of itsmanifestations as such, the phenomena of its relation with its environment.This verse can of course be interpreted on other planes. A study of the attributionsof Isis and Nephthys is helpful. This remark, or course, in no wise invalidates theabove explanation.33. I trembled at Thy coming, O my God, for Thy messenger was more terriblethan the Death­star.The Ego realizes that the Holy Guardian Angel will annihilate it. It trembles, andthis shaking of its identity is the token of its surrender (Compare the ecstasy of fear ofAmfortas at the onset of his Healing; and see II:60 and 62 with several similar"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"passages elsewhere. The doctrine is everywhere implicit; but compare also Liber 418,14th Aethyr, etc.) Also, the first appearance of the Angel is necessarilymisunderstood; for while the human Ego exists, it is bound by the conditions of itsbeing; and this implies a certain falsity of apprehension, the root of which is in thevery illusion of Separateness which makes the Idea of an Ego possible.But there are Egoes and Egoes, and Angels and Angels. We cannot generalize toofar from known data, which are scanty. Before the A∴ A∴ was reformulated by P.and D.D.S. at the beginning of this centry, the scientific method was not used toinvestigate and describe religious experience. Whatever descriptions of theKnowledge and Conversation we have, therefore, are either fictional or unintelligibleor were simply lost, or destroyed by the Adepts concerned.In what concerns the present writer, he has always been treated with the utmostpatience and gentleness by his Angel. Simultaneously, the Ordeals have been as hardas he could possibly stand. These statements may seem mutually exclusive to theprofane; it is unfortunate that this should be so. Perhaps those whose intuition isawake will understand us.We recall at least two instances of Ordeals which were quite close in conditions tothese described here. We must also point out that the verse quite clearly states ‘Thymessenger’. We refer the serious student to LXV II.33­36 and the Commentariesthereon. A messenger may synthesize all the conditions therein described, and otherand subtler conditions which can be even more terrible and harder to withstand,some of which are described in the following verses and A.C.’s Commentariesthereon.34. On the threshold stood the fulminant figure of Evil, the Horror of emptiness,with his ghastly eyes like poisonous wells. He stood, and the chamber wascorrupt; the air stank. He was an old and gnarled fish more hideous than theshells of Abaddon.The “threshold” is before the “door” or “pylon” of Daleth. (Daleth means a door;its attribution is Venus, pure Love, and its Path is from Chokmah to Binah, the baseof the Triangle of the Supernals. This “door” is thus in all ways a fit symbol of theentrance to Initiation). The “threshold” is then below the Path of Daleth on the Treeof Life; i.e., it is in the Abyss. The above symbolism refers strictly to the Attainmentof Master of the Temple; but its Truth is reflected into the technically correct accountof the Initiation of the Dominus Liminis to Adeptus Minor. Here the “door” is thethird Reciprocal or Transverse Path (Daleth is the first) Pe which means a mount —the door of the vital organs. Pe is the letter of Atu XVI the “House of God” or“Blasted Tower.” The Hieroglyph represents a Tower — symbolic of the Ego in itsPhallic Aspect, yet shut up, i.e., separate. This Tower is smitten by the LightningFlash of Illumination, the impact of the Holy Guardian Angel and the Flaming Swordof the Energy that proceeds from Kether to Malkuth. Thence are cast forth twofigures forming by their attitude the letter ע: these are the twins וח (Horus andHarpocrates) born at the breaking­open of the Womb of the Mother (the second"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"aspect of the Tower as a “spring shut up, a fountain sealed”). The represent in respectof the male aspect of the Tower the spermatozoa (ע is ♑ the sign in which is the Sunat the Winter Solstice, when the New Year begins) emitted when the Phallus issmitten by the ecstasy of the Orgasm (Lightning Flash) and “blasted” by losing itserection.On the “threshold” the Dominus Liminis is menanced by the Paths נ ,ס ,ע, theAtus XIII, XIV, XV. (Temperance or Restriction, Death, and the Devil, which issuefrom Tiphereth the abode of His Angel to ward off the profane of the Outer Order ofG.D.The main difference (in essence) between the formulae of the two Initiations, intothe R.R. et A.C. and the S.S., respectively, are that the Adeptus Exemptus is belowDaleth altogether, though he has crossed the Second Reciprocal Path Teth on his wayto become an Adeptus Exemptus, and has no Path by which he may travel (saveGimel, which leads from Tiphereth to Kether, not from Chesed, to Binah, whither heis bound. This is to ward off the profane of the Inner Order of R.R. et A.C.) while theDominus Liminis has already traversed the Path of Pe to attain the Grade ofPhilosophus, and the threshold is within, instead of without, the Pylon.The significance of this is as follows: ­In crossing the Abyss the aim is to annihilate the Ego and its appurtenancesaltogether. In Qabalistic symbolism to attain to Zero. The peril is therefore that ofidentification with any of the products of disingegration. Choronzon, therefore, bywhich same we signify the idea of Dispersion, has no place within the SupernalTriad. The threshold of initiation, the Abyss, lies wholly without the door Daleth. Thecompleteness of the disintegration, the impotence (ακρατωρ) and idleness (αεργια), isguaranteed by the absence of the love (Daleth) which might otherwise bind togetherthe dissipated events to form a unity (in the 7th Aethyr, Liber 418, we learn that if theBlack Brothers were only able to look up to the Goddess of Love (Daleth) abovethem they might yet attain to Understanding.)In the Initiation to Adeptus Minor, the conditions are altogether other. The aim isthe attainment of unity not negativity, and there is no such perfection in the Sephirothof the Ruach, Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth, which compose the Grades of the InnerOrder (R.R. et A.C.) as necessarily excluding Choronzon from the three Grades ofthe A∴ A∴. The student is now referred to the Elemental Watch­Towers of SirEdward Kelly (See The Equinox I:7and8). The four Elemental Tablets (12 ;tm 13)are bound together by the little Tablet of Spirit ( 4 x 5), or, when the Tablets arearranged to show them each as a sub­section of the unity of Tetragrammaton by ablack cross containing the letters of this little Tablet of Spirit. The names of evildemons are found notably by taking some imperfect and unbalanced symbol for theWatch­Towers such as a bilateral name from beneath the bar of the Calvary Cross inany of the Lesser Angles — and prefixing the appropriate letter from the Black Cross.The doctrine implied is that the nature of Spirit is not only represented by Shin, theHoly Spirit, whose descent into the midst of Tetragrammaton sanctifies andilluminates the blind forces of the Elements, but is also soulless matter, dark, formless"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"and void, the mere basis or background for the manifestation of all phenomenaindifferently; and this truth is also symbolized by the blackness and undevelopedpotentiality of Akasa as explained by the legend of Shiva mentioned in a previousparagraph.Spirit may therefore be manifested either as the Holy Guardian Angel or as the EvilPersona, the Dweller on the Threshold, portrayed sensationally for trade by SirEdward Bulwer­Lytton in his romance Zanoni. The doctrine is also frequently foundin folk­lore, where man is represented as attended by both a good and an evil genius.The horror of the latter is intensified by his function as the alternative to the HolyGuardian Angel.Now, in the case of Exempt Adept, should he be beaten back fromthe City of thePyramids by failure to comply perfectly with the formula of “love under will” heremains lost in the Abyss with no future possibility than to identify himself in turnwith each incoherent and unintelligible phenomenon that appears in the sensorium ofthe man, who has been disintegrated as the first to each and every imperfection whichclaims to be.Entirely different is the case of the Dominus Liminis whose operation, ifunsucessful, may be a simple failure perhaps due to no serious error of his own. Apartfrom slight discouragement he should be able to try again without disadvantage.Indeed he should have used his failure as a means of instruction. But he may also failfrom not having thoroughly assimilated the injunction of the Hieraeus in theceremony of his initiation into the Grade of Neophyte: “Fear is failure and theforerunner of failure. Be thou therefore without fear! for in the heart of the cowardVirtue abideth not!” Similarly, he may have been unable to fulfil the formula of theHierophant in that ceremony: “Remember that Unbalanced Force is evil. UnbalancedMercy is but weakness: Unbalanced Severity is but oppression.” Once more thefascination of evil may be no less perilous than the fear. In any case he may expect tobe confronted first of all by his Evil Genius (cf., further, the ceremony of Zelator inG.∙.D.∙. — the appearance of the Angels Samael, Metatron, and Sandalphon). Hemay fail to abide the onslaught. He may be thrust back from the threshold, and hisdefeat may be more or less damaging according to circumstances. But his fear may beso great as to induce him to transform it into fascination, or his exhaustion socomplete that he isprepared to purchase rest at any price. In either case the result maybe that he accepts his Evil Persona as his Guardian Angel.I should be loth to assert that even so fearful a form of failure is necessarily fataland final although evidently it must always create a disastrous Karma as involving theassertion fortified by the most solemn oaths and sealed by the most intense ecstasy ofthe absolute existence of evil, in a sense of the word, actually and ad hoc defined byhimself, i.e., he has acquiesced in duality, established an interior conflict in himself,and ceremonially blasphemed and denied the unity of his own True Will. Appallingas is such a catastrophe, it lacks the element of finality since the principles involveddo not extend above Tiphereth. He has become a Black Magician no doubt, but thisis far indeed from being a Black Brother. It cannot even be said that such an onethereby manifests any tendency to become a Black Brother when the time is ripe; for"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"his union even with the personification of Evil is also an act of love under will,though that will be false and vitiated by every conceivable defect and error. His chiefdanger is presumably that the intensity of the suffering which results from this may, asin the case of Glyndon in Zanoni, lead him to seek to escape altogether from Magick,to refrain from any act of love for fear lest he stray still farther from his true path. Lethim remember the words of my brother: “If the fool would persist in his folly hewould become wise.” Let him resolutely continue in iniquity, invoking the vengeanceof the Gods, so that at the end the excess of his love and its transcendence of anguishmay bring him back into the way of truth. From the above it should have becomeclear how it is that the Evil Genius is within the Sanctuary of the Temple of the RosyCross whose formula is “love under will,” while Choronzon is excluded alike fromthat shrine and from the City of the Pyramids whose law, although still “love underwill,” understands both those terms as without limit.But the Evil Genius is a form of Choronzon, implying as it does Duality. It merelyseems more consistent and coherent because the Dominus Liminis ahs still notreached that psychological state wherein dissociation of the impressions results fromthe slightest stimuli. He is working towards Coagula, not towards Solve. Of course, itdoes not follow that he will have any tendency to become a Black Brohter whenconfronted with the Abyss. He has made Evil the Image of his Ideal, but provided heachieves coherence, the Faculty above all associated with Tphereth, he will becomea Minor Adept. Since his Formula is Love, and since the Evil Genius, though apartial view of the Universe, is nevertheless a projection of the External, he mayaspire to the City of the Pyramids just as much as a “Good” Minor Adept. Thisdifficult subject is covered in LXV I.54 and in Liber Tzaddi 33­42.By the time the “Evil” Dominus Liminis becomes a Minor Adept, his conception ofEvil will have expanded to include much that is called “Good”­the more so the betterthe mans mind may be. Such was the case of Crowley himself, who started byrevolting against the “Good” that he saw produce so much misery in the worldabout him. But the mind of Aleister Crowley was already so ample and deep ins copethat his vision of the Evil Persona was never so partial as to make possible to him tobecome what we might call a Sorcerer. He invoked Satan, true; but he got not theimage of his ego and its appetites, but htat Dark Star which trhoughout the ages haswaited for men to ask themselves: “But is there not something more in theUniverse?”The Evil is now described. The language is of course symbolic. At the same timethe appearance here given might correspond very closely with the actual expressionsof experience.This, however, only in the case of a Dominus Liminis who had not swerved fromthe Middle Path: “Good and Evil are one to Him.”The man who accepted his Evil Genius as his Angel might see a formidable,austere, or powerful Image, ready to help him satisfy his desires and acquirematerial power over his surroundings and his fellowmen. We refer the seriousstudent to The Sacred magic of Abramelin the Mage, where the wily author"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"mentions, alsmost in passing, that at the beginning of the Operation the operatormight see a man of good and benevolent aspect who would pretend to be his Angeland promise him riches, etc. etc. in exchange for adoration. The author goes on tomention damnation of the soul as a result of falling for this promise, if we mistakenot. The Abramelin book is, of course, spurious and mostly fiction; calculated,moreover, to awaken sympathy for the Jews at a time when they were, as a religion,persecuted everywhere. The ethical outlook is remarkably modern, and religioustolerance speaks to the intellect rather than the heart of the reader. The Operationitself, however, is possible, and the Magick Squares really have power, and aredangerous to anyone who has not yet achieved the balance of Tiphereth. Cf.Pantanjali on the Siddha and their worthlessness to the real Yogi. The Aspirant iswise to go straight to the Highest; then the powers will be seen in their properperspective, and he will not make mistakes in their application, but will follow theThelemic injunction: “So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will.”Further, we must remark on the concept of ‘vengeance of the Gods’.First we refer the serious student to AL II.22, particularly the words: “Be strong, oman! Lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall denythee for this.” And finally we refer him to AL I.52 Perhaps he will undersand now inwhat circumstances he can expect retaliation. And last, but not least, he is referred toAL III.16. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.We are twice told that he “stood” which is to be contrasted with the activity of“going” of the Holy Guardian Angel (see verses 37 ­ 41). It is the peculiar token ofany God that he should go. For this reason he bears the Ankh or sandal­strap in theEgyptian monuments. This antithesis is connected with the conception of the BlackBrothers as shutting themselves up, or resenting change. The thelemic conception ofthe Universe is dynamic, so that stasis is inevitably the symbol of conflict withNature. It is the equivalent of Death; for Death being a change, it is an event, i.e., ahenomenon of activity of life. This doctrine should be studied very thoroughly inCCXX.Let the student attend, moreover, to the contrast between the symbols of the HolyGuardian Angel and those of the Evil Genius. The former, (See verses 38 ­ 41) arepositive, active, solid, dynamic; of chariots, horseman, spearmen, the weapons ofJupiter and Pan are tremendously vital in his hands. Per contra the Evil Genius isvague, unreal and inactive. His characteristics are horror and emptiness. His eyesare ghastly, which I take in its strict sense as connected with geist. And this epithet ispeculiarly abhorrent since the sense of sight is attributed to Fire, and should beclear­cut and luminous. Such activities as he commands are slow, cozy andvermicular. They resemble wells of poisoned water, i.e. they lurk and receive as littlelight as possible, whereas the ideal eye should dart forth flame. He causes even theair about him to stagnate and stink. Anatomically he resembles a fish, a cold­bloodedinhabitant of the passive element. (Note the fish as the accepted symbol of Jesus).Even so, he is old, slow­moving, while the chief virtue of fish is to be quickly gliding.And he is gnarled, offering unnecessary resistance to his own movement, andincreasing its friction. Hideous!"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Actually, the eyes of those “dwellers” are quite capable of glowing. Their glow,however, is like the glow of putrefying gases accidentally ignited, it is not a cleanflame. And its most noticeable quality is a hatred of poisonous intensity.

He enveloped me with his demon tentacles; yea, the eight fears took holdupon me. His method of combat as distinct from that of the Angel which is topierce with a spear or smite with a thunderbolt is to envelope with hisdemoniacal and therefore illusory tentacles. This method is to restrict theAspirant well knowing that “the word of Sin is restriction.” He succeeds incommunicating the “eight fears,” which are connected with the eight heads ofthe stooping dragon. (See, for this symbolism, “The Temple of Solomon theKing,” The Equinox I:1;nd3) They are the restrictions to the Supernal Triadattempted by the seven lower Sephiroth and Daath. Hence the Stooping Dragonis shown on the Tree of Life below the Abyss after the Fall, and on the floor ofthe Vault of Christian Rosencreutz. In the older symbolism they are the eightKeys of Edom.36. But I was anointed with the right sweet oil of the Magister; I slipped fromthe embrace as a stone from the sling of a boy of the woodlands.The Aspirant is “anointed with the right sweet oil of the Magister.” The Magisterpertaining to Binah, this oil may be taken to symbolize his Neschamah or aspiration.See the account of the Holy Oil given in Book 4, Part II. Also the essential propertyof oil is to diminish friction and increase ease of movement. It is therefore theprecisely right reply to this type of attack.Furthermore, the Aspirant compares himself to a stone, which refers to the cubicstone symbolic of perfect adeptship, being the squared and equilibrated perfection ofthe spiritual Masonry; it is bounded by six squares which signify protection byMacroprosopus. See also the symbolism of the Stone in the Zohar, a subject far tooextensive to make more than this single indication practicable. There is, furthermore,an identification of the Stone with the Sacred Phallus and of the Sun as worshipped inthe Temple of Diana at Ephesus and in the word ABRASAX. In our own holybooks, see V:6 and 58 of this Book and Liber VII V:2. In this last connection notethe proper juxtaposition of stones as symbolic of the Great Work. This is to be foundalso in The Voice of Silence, where those who have attained build themselves into awall to protect mankind. See also Liber VII VII:6This stone is a missile in the “sling of a boy of the woodlands” who may be takento represent the most youthful and active form of Pan, i.e. the aspirant considershimself as flung forth from the infinite and released from his swathings. (Cf. Liber"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"XVII, VII:3 ­ 5) that he may perform the Great Work.37. I was smooth and hard as ivory; the horror gat no hold. Then at the noise ofthe wind of Thy coming he was dissolved away, and the abyss of the great voidwas unfolded before me.The aspirant is smooth; his qualities have been perfectly harmonised. He is hard,having perfected his resistance to extreme pressure. The analogy is with ivory. Ivoryis the substance of the tooth, the letter Shin of the Holy Spirit and also of thesubstance of the skeleton on which his being is being built. The sound Sh moreoverrepresents the power of silence as well as the activity and alertness which accompanythe will to manifest oneself through one’s True Will. I here quote from my originalnotes on the intrinsic meaning of the letter: “S is the serpent­hiss, the sharp breath,teeth bared yet clenched, which is the natural token of alarm, hate, defiance, natural toa man who meets his fellow­berration from legitimate monkeyhood. By it herecognizes his brother, and names him accordingly, when need was. (Later, whenalarm had died, we have still “sh!” — Hush! ­ not a call for Silence, which it breaks,but a claim on the Attention of other men.) In S is this idea of fear and anger,combines these ideas; so the first S­gods were storm­gods. Later, this breath, airmoving in men, might be known for a proof that he lived; then this breath­letter, S,might come to mean “life.” For instance, God breathes on Adam to make him a“living soul,” and Elisha raises a boy to life by breathing on him. The Ruach Elohimagain is a Breath that broods Chaos. At last we find a Holy Ghost begetting by dint ofa breath. And was not Maut the Mother­Vulture impregnated by the wind? Perhapstoo the hiss of the rain which fertilizes earth, as even a savage must observe intropical lands where the result is so swift, may have helped him to the convention thatS should mean life. This rain comes from the air which he breathes, though frombeyond him; it seems then to him natural to make Zeus or Shu rain­gods and life­godsas well as air­gods, storm­gods, names for the fierce, the fearful anger which at firstonly meant “an enemy” — his fellow­man!” (Diary, June 1920).The Evil Genius is accordingly unable to dominate the aspirant. He having provedhis virtue is now ready to receive the Holy Guardian Angel. Firstly is the noise of Hiscoming. “For the Lord shall descend from Heaven, with a shout, with the voice oftheArchangel, and with the trump of God.” “The Lord” is Adonai — which is theHebrew for ‘my Lord’; and He descends from Heaven, the supernal Eden, theSahasrara Cakkra in man, with a ‘shout,’ a ‘voice’ and a ‘trump,’ again airy symbols,for it is air that carries sound. These sounds refer to those heard by the Adept at themoment of rapture.” (Book 4, Part II). This by itself is sufficient to destroy the illusionof the Evil Genius. The “abyss of the great void” is unfolded before the aspirant, i.e.,all positive phenomena disappear. What remains is the “infinite space” of Nuit. Thecontinuous body of infinite possibilities.A correction must be made here. It is not the Sahashara that is active in theInitiation of the Adeptus Minor, bu the Visuddhi, ‘home of Akasha’. Phenomena ofsound are referred to Akasha, the symbol of which is an ear. The Abyss of courseunfolds before the Adept­it is related to the Initiation, which immediatley opens the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"perspective of the Next Step. Cf. LXV III.47­48. Also, although the Spiritual forcecomes from Visuddhi, it activates the Anahata. It comes dextro=rotatory, that is,from an “awakened Kundalini”. (Although in these matters the rate of vibration andthe plane of vibration are more important than the direction of movement.)38. Across the waveless sea of eternity Thou didst ride with Thy captains andThy hosts; with Thy chariots and horsemen and spearmen didst Thou travelthrough the blue.“The waveless sea of Eternity” repeats this idea. It is the timeless menstruum ofaction, unstirred by any vibration, while ready to receive and transmit that which isimposed thereupon by the will. The Holy Guardian Angel approaches rapidly(‘rides’) accompanied by his hosts (Note ; Tzaddi Beth Aleph, an host = 93).39. Before I saw Thee Thou wast already with me; I was smitten through byThy marvellous spear.The arrival of the Angel is too rapid for the perception of the Adept. Cf. II:60 etc.The symbolism of the spear should be studied in the legends of the Crucifixion, ofParzifal, and others. The matter is further elucidated in Bagh­i­Muattar.40. I was stricken as a bird by the bolt of the thunderer; I was pierced as thethief by the Lord of the Garden.The Thunderer is Jupiter, here considered as the creative paternal, and warriorLord of the Air. The bolt is the Swastika, or Disc of Zeus. Its symbolism is ultimatelyidentical with that of the sphere. The bird is the natural symbol of the aspiring soul.Cf. II:39­41. The Swastika has the shape of the letter Aleph whose Temurah is PLA,(see Sepher Sephiroth) by which we mean the instantaneous destruction of the Ego inSamadhi. The second phrase echoes the two former. The Lord of the Garden is Panor Priapus whom my brother Catullus constantly represents as punishing thieves inhis peculiar manner. There is a special symbolism of the thief in which perhaps wefind trances of the Legend of the Crucifixion and the ritual of the priest of Nemi butits detailed signification has been to a great extent lost or abandoned.41. O my Lord, let us sail upon the sea of blood!Cf. II:15, similar passage. I:33­41 especially verses 33 and 39. Immediately theAdept has attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angelhe loses no time, but goes on the way of his True Will, borne upon the flood of thephysical life which he has spilt in order to enjoy the impersonal and effortless life incommunion with his Angel.Let it be understood, however, that the impersonal and effortless life is the Trancestate, and when the Adept returns from this to do his True Will he is subject to thenormal problems of material life. The planes must not be confused. We remember thecase of an Adept who, walking along a city street still in the aftertase of ecstasy, saaw"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"a man in the habit of a roman Catholic priest coming twoards him As everybodyknows, Aspirants to the A∴ A∴ are supposed to exorcize people in the vestments ofany of the religions cursed in AL III.51­53. The Adept, however, refrained fromdoing so, accepting, as he thought, this person in its habit as part of the Universalbeauty he had just beheld in his Angel. As a result, his aura was blasted by a powerso malignant that for five years afterwards the astral wound then produced still gavehim trouble in Magickal Operations. He had simply mistaken the Plane of Tiphereth,where he had been, for the plane of matter, where he now was. It took him ten yearsto understand this.Let this be a warning to others. Let them also remember that it is advisable toremain in retirement for several days after any Trance of Union, doing simple androutinary work of a temporal kind, to give the mind time to adjust to its newfoundparameters, and to give the aura time to become sufficiently sedate not to shockpeople you may come in contact with. Exceptions to this rule are only Initiates ofgreat experience or who practiced Liber III to perfection.42. There is a deep taint beneath the ineffable bliss; it is the taint of generation.Verses 42­44 present a lyrical picture of the Mystery of Evil.Lyrical it may be; but describes a perception that comes to all of us some time oranother during the Path.42: The bliss of the union of the Adept and his Angel appears to contain a flaw, inthat being an operation of change “the taint of generation” it shares the impermanenceof all complex phenomena and therefore the liability to sorrow. See Cap. III vv. 21­25.Actually, the perception involved is deeper than the mere sense of empermanence,and sorrow at this: it is a sense of something that partakes of that filthi of the blindworm of slime from which mankind evolved. You might say that it is the “angel” partof our consciousness lamenting its connection with the beast.43. Yea, though the flower wave bright in the sunshine, the root is deep in thedarkness of earth.Admits that the most admirable manifestations spring from deep­seated mysteries.Corruption lies at the heart of all things.44. Praise to thee, O beautiful dark earth, thou art the mother of a millionmyriads of myriads of flowers.No attempt is made to contradict the above or to explain it away. The solutioncomes from looking at the other side of the matter. Corruption itself and all themysteries of sorrow are to be held matters for rejoicing, since they are the engineswhose work results in truth and beauty. Cf. CCXX Cap. I, vv. 29 and 30.You can’t explain away a fact of life: you can only enlarge your perspective toinclude it. The tendency to avoid “lower things” is very dangerous. On one side, it"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"stops development; on another, it may produce a habit of living that may lead to“black brotherhood” someday. The Adept to which we referred above refused toaccept the “taint of generation” when he saw the Roman priest approaching. As aresult, his aura was blasted by the demonic force which that priest represented. Hewas doubly wrong in not exorcising the priest, anyway, since it is a command thatcomes from the Lord of the Aeon Himself.That same Adept, while still a Probationer, on a certain occasion had a gift fromthe Gods: a perfectly fromed, still warm hawk, met with on a solitary walk. TheProbationer had been planning to furnish a Magickal Temple, and he needed a fan.Forthwith he started pulling out the pinions of the dead bird. The last one, however,came out hardly, and with a piece of flesh attached. Disgusted, instead of cleaning upthe feather, the Probationer crushed it and threw it away. Then he had “anintimation” and counted the remaining feathers: he had only ten. The eleventh,which would have completed the fan perfectly, he had thrown away. At this momentthe perception of the meaning of these verses came to him, although he had not yetread or learned them by heart: the perception that filth is part of life, and thatsometimes you must go down into filth to get the pearl of great price. Although hekept the feathers he then had, he never made his fan. Nor did he complete his temple.He had disobeyed the rules of the A∴ A∴ and had learned Liber AL by heart insteadof Liber LXV, reasoning that if he msut learn something by heart, he would “startwith the highest”. He remained a Probationer for nine years, and it was only afterseveral ordeals that he became sufficiently humble to do his job properly. In threemonths he psased to Neophyte. While learning LXV by heart (he learned the entireBook) he came to the present passage. The incident of the dead hawk cameimmediatley to his consciousness. But as we can see from the incident of hisAdeptship already mentioned, he still did not entriely learn is lesson. Let us hope heknows better now.45. Also I beheld my God, and the countenance of Him was a thousandfoldbrighter than the lightning. Yet in his heart I beheld the slow and dark One, theancient one, the devourer of His children.45­53. This passage is the most difficult in the Chapter. It is difficult to consider itsverses separately. Yet there seems to be no proper coherence in them, no singleorderly idea is their diversity. The solution seems to be in the direction of a realisationthat the passage is in the nature of progressive discovery. It resembles the account of amental journey. One of the keys to it is the sudden shifting of the point of view notedabove, vv. 43­44. The contemplation of Beauty leads to the reflection upon theelements of Beauty which we do not recognise as beautiful because our sensorium isnot djusted to that stage of existence. Cf. my poem on “Ovariotomy”, where theplastic beauty of woman seems to be destroyed by cutting her up. Yet the beautyreappears in a different form when the cells of which she is composed are examinedunder the microscope. Let us apply this key to the passage here under consideration.45. In the first sentence attention is called to the brilliance of the appearance of theAngel. The second sentence recognises that beneath this appearance is a symbol of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"terror, viz., Saturn, who is here understood by his astrological and legendaryattributions. We must be at pains to note that Saturn is the god of generation. Thisestablishes a reference to verse 42. Saturn is called the devourer of his childrenbecause he is Time who conceals in oblivion the phenomena he has brought forthfrom the inane. But there is a further meaning which is that he is not bound by theresults of his action. Whatever he does results only in a transitory phenomenon whichvanishes automatically as time goes on. Shallow minded people are accustomed toregret impermanence. They fail to realize that if everything that happened remained inexistence the burden of facts would soon become intolerable. Nature requires anexcretory system or she would soon become clogged with the multiplicity of her ownillusions. The progress of the human mind depends upon its power to assimilate thedetails of any work. They constitute the finished product and appear therein only in achanged form. The rough working must be destroyed. The process is continuous. Theart of progress is to compose constantly more complex and more comprehensivesynthesis; just as the words of a poem surrender their intrinsic meaning in order tocompose the unity of the impression made by the poem as a whole, so again thepoems of the poet. This formula is universally applicable. It is particularly the subjectof biology.46. In the height and the abyss, O my beautiful, there is no thing, verily, there isno thing at all, that is not altogether and perfectly fashioned for Thy delight.Is to Verse 45 as verse 44 is to verse 43. The work of Saturn seems no longermysterious and terrible because its nature changes and is lost in the admirable result ofits operation.47. Light cleaveth unto Light, and filth to filth; with pride one contemnethanother. But not Thou, who art all, and beyond it; who art absolved from theDivision of the Shadows.Cf. CCXX, Cap. I vv. 22 ­ 23 and similiar passages. It is natural to us to make adistinction between things, to prefer one thing to another. But the Angel is abovesuch duality. All things equally contribute to his perfection. He is said to be “absolvedfrom the Division of the Shadows”, i.e. from the illusion of dividuality. It is only anillusion that difference is apparent between diverse phenomena. The most fatalmistake that the Adept can make is to emphasise the desirability of one set of thingsand the undersirability of another. If he persist in so doing his sectarianism will thwarthis ideal so that his Angel, instead of being complete, comprehensive, and perfect,will represent his personal prejudices. In such a case the Adept will suffer wheneverhis attention is called to any idea in Nature which is not successfully transmuted andincluded in the scope of his aspiration.We must however, remember that the Adept, like anyone else, has his work to do.We try to modify environment, and we either succeed or fail. Philosophicalperception, for instance, of the existence of a Roman Catholic Church, must bebalanced by the resolve­if you have this resolve­to eradicate the possibility of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"existence of such a symptom of disease from the surface of the globe. In short, wework upon the raw material of phenomena with the intention of producing change.This is Magick. And we may feel reasonably disgusted by the presence of evidence ofthe continued existence of something we are trying to destroy. ‘To make no differencebetween things’ must not be interpreted as Laissez­faire. We refer the reader to thecase of the Adept we just mentioned a while ago. The planes must not­repeat not­bemixed.48. O day of Eternity, let Thy wave break in foamless glory of sapphire uponthe laborious coral of our making!This doctrine is restated. The coral is the Karma produced by the accumulation ofour acts. This construction has taken place in time and its need is to be covered by therhythm of Eternal Delight. The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel set as a point of contact between two continua. Neither is comprehensivewithout the other.49. We have made us a ring of glistening white sand, strewn wisely in the midstof the Delightful Ocean.The symbolism of the previous verse is carried on. The ring indicated theperfection of our own being on the synthesis of our actions. We have constitutedourselves as a positive phenomenon situated in a realm of infinite possibilities, withwhich we can make contact, as we choose. To understand this passage properly wemust keep in mind the teaching of CCXX about the nature of existence. Theappearance of the Khu, a series of marriages of Hadit and Nuit, lead to thecongregation of what may be called a positive individuality of the Second Orderwhich is ready to act as a unit, and to invoke Nuit.There is another meaning to this verse, possibly more cogent. It refers to the use ofthe Quintessence to produce certain results. Verse 51 give its use to produce anotherand a different result. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.50. Let the palms of brilliance flower upon our island; we shall eat of their fruit,and be glad.Vv. 50­51 show the two forms in which this plan can be executed.50: Acts of love under will may be directed to the creation of masterpieces. Thereare the “palms” whose flower delights, whose fruit nourishes our personality. Suchacts may also be directed inwardly — the mystical process as opposed to the magical,the dissolution of the personality regarded as imperfection. The text indicates apreference for the latter process. This is natural, the work at issue being theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and this is primarily awork of dissolution rather than of further construction.The text indicates a preference for the latter process on the part of AleisterCrowley. There is no necessary relation between the process and the Work of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Tiphereth, which is not of dissolution, but of harmonization, not Solve, but Coagula.51. But for me the lustral water, the great ablution, the dissolving of the soul inthat resounding abyss.What this actually means is that the Work of the IX ° Degree O.T.O. can lead tothe Crossing of the Abyss. The Adepts are of many types and of many fields ofactivity. If they are like 666, they do not stop at Initiations to gather their laurels, butgo straight on. This is not supposed to be a model of behavior. Suum Cuique.52. I have a little son like a wanton goat; my daughter is like an unfledgedeaglet; they shall get them fins, that they may swim.The symbolism is here particularly obscure. The son is presumably Ruach and thedaughter Nephesch. The former seems to be described in respect of its capriciousnessand the latter of its poor undevelopment in the matter of aspiration. They are to befurnished with the means of rhythmical motion. The defect of the goat of theNephesch is its idleness, its lack of wings. They are then to be rendered capable ofordered movement within the element of the nature of the Angel.This is entirely incorrect. The Angel states that He has a little son like a wantongoat: that is, He has produced in the Adept, by His Creative Energy, the birth of anew seed of Ruach possessing the potentialities of Pan. And he has equally producedthe birth of a new Nephesch possessing the potentialities of the Eagle, which must bestudied in Alchemy. This daughter has wings; they are merely unfledged as yet. Theyshall get them fins that they may swim in the “warm honey” of the Adept’s being. Cf.v. 8.Of course, the opposite point of view may be taken. The Adept may be speaking, inwhich case his children by the Angel must become capable of traveling in the Beingof their Begetter, and thereby growing through that process of resonance that wehave already spoken about. It makes no difference. Both views are simultaneouslycorrect.It must always be understood that the Lower Sheaths of the Self are fashioned bythe Self in its search for Self­Realization. Manas and both Shariras are porduced bythe Ahamkara, which is itself nothing but the expression of the Higher Triad’s Will toincarnate. The process of Initiation consists in the destruction of those lowerprinciples and their reconstruction on a higher evolutionary coil of the spiral. In this,those of Our Order have the assistance of the Holy Guardian Angel. But there isnever any question of obsession or implantation of “alien” material. Theseinterpretations belong to the unregenerated Ahamkara. The Magister Templi isalways of the seed of the man in whom He manifests. Cf. AL I.21, 29, 30, 45, 48, 52;Liber VII i.41­45, iii.1­15, 53­60, iv.55­59, vi.17­41, vii.11­14, 29­52.53.

This heart of mine is girt about with the serpent that devoureth his owncoils.The symbols of the heart and the serpent are retained to represent the Adept andthe Angel, but the Angel is now shown as identical with the great Snake, Ananta,which surrounds the Universe and by constantly devouring its own coils graduallyrestricts the manifested Cosmos.This is, of course, a continuation of the perception started in 42­46. In man, thisSnake Ananta manifests as Death. Cf. AL ii.6.55. When shall there be an end, O my darling, O when shall the Uni verse andthe Lord thereof be utterly swallowed up?The Adept enquires with regard to the process. (The answer is apparently given inverse 65.) Despite the perfection of his rapture, the Adept appears to recognise that itis only so to speak an oasis in the desert. He extends his aspiration from the personalproblem of his own sorrow to the contemplation of the Universal Sorrow.This, of course, is rather presumptuous on the Adept’s part, since he simply equatethe Universe of Men, of which he as just become aware by passing the Veil ofParoketh), with the Cosmic Universe. In Liber VII the Magister Templi makes nosuch mistake, since the word “universe” either comes in lower case or in capitals,depending on what universe is being spoken about. But the Magister’s point of viewis ampler, of course.“The Lord of the Universe,” who appears quite often in this Book and Liber VII, isto be interpreted in four main acceptions. First of all, it is Chesed, “whom all mencall the First”, and any Father­Image that you happen to connote therewith: God­the­Father in the case of the Christists, Jehovah in case of Jews, any image ofBuddha or Krishna obtained through Dhyana, etc. Second, it is Daath, whichmanifests through Chesed, and which is projected on the External Unvierse. This is aslightly subtler perception, and pertains precisely to those lower initiates who letthemselves be deceived by Dhyana. The Black Brothers go one step further andidentify themselves with it. Certain Brahmins, of course, confuse it with Atma. Third,in a very special acception, it is Ra­Hoor­Khuit, one aspect of the Lord of the Aeon.Wen the phrase is used in this sense it can be, as a rule, identified. Finally, it isequated with some inaginary Creator above and beyond all known concepts,including Kether. This, by they way, is risible, since such a concept could only arisein a Ruach, and not an enlightened one, at that. If there were such an animal, itwould be Hadit.56. Nay! who shall devour the Infinite? who shall undo the Wrong of theBeginning?The Adept appears to be overwhelmed by this consideration. It seems to himtheoretically impossible to “undo the wrong of the Beginning.” This means that hehas now understood the doctrine that the beginning (Berashith) is necessarily of the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"nature of error. Any separateness, any sense of finitude represents imperfection. It is amatter of plain logic that it should be so. He has of course succeeded in making hispersonal imperfection the means of attaining self­consciousness and thereby aspiritual state beyond anything of which he seemed capable. But his attainmenthaving made him aware of the whole Universe and identified it with the conditions ofhis own sublime being he experiences the Trance of Sorrow.Which shows, of course, what an ass he is, and how further he must still go.“Plain logic,” indeed! The Adept resents that fact that there is a “deep taint”beneath all bliss. He wants Perfection. He resents Change. He resents the existenceof anything that disturbs the calm and peace of his position as center of the kingdomof his soul, and he does not realize that it is the Angel Himself, and the existence ofthe Angel Himself, that thus disturbs him. He does not realize that he is reacting likethat self­same savage of a hundred thousand years ago, to whom any stranger wasan enemy. He does not realize the Formula of Nuit, for which see AL I.28­30. Hedoes not perceive that Sorrow is an illusion, and the worst of the illusions, because itseems­only seems­to mortify the Ahamkara. Actually, it is the most insidious finalstronghold of the Ego. Whatever is Sorrow for thee is Joy for some other part of theUnivewrse­the true Universe. Therefore have the manhood to understand AL II.9,and to practice AL II.60. “But always unto me.” We continue with A.C.’sCommentary:It must be borne in mind that Qabalastically the Adept has no special cognizance ofany Sephira above Tiphereth until he has attained thereto. This postulate ispromulgated simply for convenience of calculation. In actual practice it is of courseusual for the aspirant to be imbued by wiser motives than those determined by hisrecognition of his personal imperfections.The point of the passage is to show how the attainment, instead of being as thepostulate was apt to image the completion of the Great Work, may extend hisconception of that work from a personal to an impersonal sphere. The first lesson thathe learn in fact is that he must apply himself immediately to fitting himself to enter theThird Order, now that at least he is admitted to the Second. I quote Liber 418, the14th Aethyr. It states the doctrine with singular insight and eloquence.57. Thou criest like a white cat upon the roof of the Universe; there is none toanswer Thee.This verse throws light on the three previous. The Angel is now clearly understoodas only concerned with the Adept as such in total fraction of his whole function. He isno longer the goal and crown of the Adept. That work being accomplished it is seenin proper perspective. The Adept begins to apprehend the nature of the Angel as he isin himself, i.e., as he is a relation of the Macrocosm. Now in the particular case of666, the Angel being Aiwass, the pertinence of verses 54­56, which were at first sightrather puzzling, as indicating a new and unfamiliar aspect of the Angel, is seen to beabsolute. Aiwass is the Logos of the Aeon, his number being 93, like that of Θελημαthe word of the Law. 666 is the instrument of which he and the Secret Chiefs of the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"A.∙.A.∙. prepared and employed as an instrument by which the Law might beproclaimed. 666 is the 4th number of Sol whose House is Leo, the Lion, which againis the Sign of the man 666 (rising at his birth). This man therefore apprehending hisAngel as the perfection of his own symbol likened him to a white (Kether) cat (lion)and, since he is the Logos, says to Him “Thou criest.” This is the link with verses 54­56, for 666 looks to Aiwass to undo the Wrong of the Beginning by the utterance of aWord. It seems, however, to the nature of the Word is altogether sublime. The roof ofthe Universe is a symbol of Kether, or of Kether with the Paths א and ב which issuefrom it forming symbolically a roof to the Tree of Life. “There is none to answerThee”. Above Kether is None or the Negative, the three kinds of Ain or Nothing.The complaint of 666 is therefore that this Word will find no echo save in the heart ofNuit.Some remarks are necessary here. First, Aiwass is not the Word of the Aeon,being, as he himself states very clearly, the minister of Hoor­paar­kraat. The Word ofthe Aeon, the Logos thereof, is 666. The “secret chiefs” are all those Initiates whocrossed the Abyss. Some are so immeasurably advanced that they may function asviceroys of the Unknown God, and sit on the thone of Ra. All of them function asHoly Guardian Angels as they pelase. Speculation as to their nature can only lead todisaster. They are, of course, unknown, since they have no function to declare tomankind at large except when they assume an Office such as Lord of the Aeon,Hierophant of the Magi, or Hierophant of the magistrie Templi. Aiwass was, ofcourse, the Logos in the last Aeon; the Logos of an Aeon is always the Initiator of theLogos of the Aeon following. Aiwass, of course, is not Heru­ra­ha. He is Aiwass. Butabove the Abyss, and at hteir level of initiation, these distinctions are as academic asthey seem important at our level.58. Thou art like a lonely pillar in the midst of the sea; there is none to beholdThee, O Thou who beholdest all!This verse Repeats the idea of verse 57. The “lonely pillar” represents Chokmah,the Creative Word, the Phallic Mercury, the Wisdom by which the world werecreated. The sea is Binah, the natural abode of Chokmah. The nature of Binah thoughindeed to understand is to be the great darkness. This is the conventional symbolism.Many examples of it are given in this and other sacred books. But see in particularLiber 418:Twelfth AethyrThis is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of Abominations, and this is themystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything that liveth, andhath become a partaker in its mystery. And because she hath made herself the servantof each, therefore is she become the mistress of all. Not as yet canst thoucomprehended her glory.Beautiful art thou, O Babylon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself toeverything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength.

For ever thus must she veil brilliance of Her Self.”O Babylon, Babylon, th# might Mother, that ridest upon the crowned beast, let mebe drunken upon wine of thy fornications; let thy kisses wanton me unto death, thateven I, thy cup­bearer, mayunderstand.Now, through the ruddy glow of the cup, I may perceive far above, and infinitelygreat, the vision of Babylon.

O thou that art master of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg?Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul and lo! even I, who am the solelight, a spark shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.Liber VII VII:28­33.I am the One beyond these all; and I bear the symbols of the mighty darkness.There shall be a sigil as of a vast black brooding ocean of death and the centralblaze of darkness, radiating its night upon all.It shall swallow up that lesser darkness. But in that profound who shall answer:What is? Not I.Not Thou, O God!A principal symbol of Chokmah as the Phallic Mercury is the eye I quote from thevision of Him as observed in The Paris Working: “He (Mercury) is essentially phallic,but he has a book in his hand, the Book which has one hundred and six pages. Onthe last page, as a colophon, is a four­pointed star, very luminous, and this is to beidentified with the eye of Shiva, and the book pertains to the Grade of 7° = 4▫. TheSub­title of the Book is BIA, which is said to mean ‘force”‘.In this aspect although Chokmah is the Word he sees and does not speak. TheWord is in fact Act itself, rather than any intelligible utterance. The complaint of 666seems then to be that neither by word nor deed can Aiwass undo the Wrong of theBeginning. Θελημα which is itself an absolute symbol of Chokmah is beyond thecomprehension of the Universe whose imperfection its function is to remedy.59. Thou dost faint, thou dost fail, thou scribe; cried the desolate Voice; but Ihave filled thee with a wine whose savour thou knowest not.The epithet ‘desolate’ attracts the attention immediately. The word is derived fromde­solare, de having an intensive force, so that desolate means “utterly alone.” The"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Hierophants have however been accustomed to communicate arcana in the presenceof the profane by taking advantage of the similarity of sound between Sol and solus,especially in such parts of the declension as soli which is genitive singular of solusand dative singular of Sol, and solis, genitive singular of Sol and ablative plural ofsolus. The word desolate may therefore be intended to indicate the attribution of theAngel both to Kether (Solus) and to Tiphereth (Sol). The de may imply a reference tohis relation with the adept through the Path of ד, Love, especially in view of the factthat His word Θελημα, 93, contains the idea of Agape, 93.We must remark once more that there is no communication between and Adeptand ד except through the Guardian of the Abyss; Daleth pertains to the Supernals.The Angel is implying the relation between Chokhmah and Binah, not betweenHimself and the Adept. His ‘normal’ contact with the Adept is through the HighPriestess, ג.The verse is a direct reply of Aiwass to 666 who was actually very disheartened atrealising that the Great Work which he had accomplished, for all its raptures of hispersonal sorrow, was but the gateway of the Path of the stupendous task ofrediscovering the Universe as he had done for himself. Aiwass explains that he hasactually made the magical link necessary between Himself and the World through theman 666. My fainting under the sense of my responsibility, my feeling that my workfor the world was foredoomed to failure, were due to my ignorance of what Aiwasshad done.He claims that he has filled me with “a wine whose savour thou knowest not”.Wine is the universal symbol for spiritual ecstasy and the means of producing it. 666does not know precisely how this ecstasy which throbs his life will affect others.More remarks are necessary. The man is not 666, but Aleister Crowley the“scribe”; the verse is perfectly clear as to this. Also, it is this man, this commonvessel of flesh, who has been filled with a wine whose savor he knows not. Thereader is referred to AL II.10­13, and the Commentaries thereon. 666 knowsperfectly well of what wine is being spoken. The process is normal in Our Order; seeLiber VII, VII.46­52. “Thou dost fain, thou dost fail.” This writer has, throughout theyears, read many criticisms of Aleister Crowley’s character, many complaints of thediscrepancy (assumed by the complainers, at any rate) between his words and hisactions. Leaving aside the lack of intelligence of the complainers, and their lack ofspiritual stature to criticize the instrument of the Logos, try to visualize what it musthave meant, for a creature of flesh and blood, to start a new current of energy in anocean of currents going nowhere, knotted up in their own inertia. Try to visualize theenmity awakened by such a man, try to envision the currents of hostile force, ofhatred of the utmost intensity, directed against him.

It shall avail to make drunken the people of the old gray sphere that rolls inthe infinite Far­off; they shall lap the wine as dogs that lap the blood of abeautiful courtesan pierced through by the Spear of a swift rider through thecity.“The old gray sphere that rolls in the infinite Far­off” is the earth; for the place intowhich the Adept is caught up tohold communion with his Angel is remote from the material Universe.Nevertheless this wine which may symbolise CCXX itself or even the poetry or thebiography of the man 666 is guaranteed to posses the virtue of intoxicating theinhabitants of this planet.The final symbol is strangely and even formidably vivid. The reference to the dogs,the blood, and the swift rider suggest the story of Jehu and Jezebel, but the allusion isnot accurate or altogether intelligible. The general symbolism is neverthelesssufficiently clear. Cf., in the first place, Cap III:40.8 and Liber VII VII.15­16. Cf. alsothe uniform representation of the Adept as a maiden or harlot. For the swift rider Cf.Cap. IV:38­39 and the general symbolism of the Angel as bearer of the sacred lanceor phallus and as mounted on a horse to indicate his swiftness and his power overthe animal nature.Blood is constantly used as a symbol of the flowing life the vehicle of animalenergy.The meaning of the verse is then that this spilth of the orgia of the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel becomes the nourishment and the meansof intoxication of the dogs, i.e. of animals of a lower stage of evolution. It is however,hinted that they contain in themselves the hidden godhead. See CCXX II:19. Theyhave only to reverse their magical formula to attain the divinity. Note also the use ofthe word ‘lap’ which suggests their thirst, eagerness and enjoyment,but also isconnected with the symbolism of the number 111. This implies the ‘thick darkness’and the ‘sudden death’ involved in the process of Initiation. There is also the wholedoctrine of “The Fool.” Besides all this, the word ‘lap’ is in the Angelic Language.(See The Equinox I:8, The 48 Calls or Keys.”) Because thus indicating that thelimitation and sorrow of these dogs is due to their subservience to the faculty ofreason. ‘There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shallmake a great miss.

He should then construct a visualprojection of the scene described in this verse. In this way he should eventually arriveat a direct intuitive apprehension of the way in which the life work of 666 may availhim to become partaker of the sacrament of initiation. Cf. also Liber VII III:16, 20­25(24!), 49­50, 56­60, IV:17­24, VII:47­49.I have emphasized the importance of this passage on the following consideration:My own magical career began by my taking an oath to attain Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel on entirely selfish and personal grounds. Ihad, it is true, experienced the Trance of Sorrow, but the motive power in this Tranceto formulate the oath was strictly confined to my individual dissatisfaction with thesituation in which I found myself — as far as I know without any intention of myown. In the course of preparing to carry out the Operation of the Sacred Magic ofAbremelin the Mage, I discovered that my interests were inseparable from those ofhumanity at large. I however formulated my True Will in this way. My mission onearth was to teach men “the next step,” i.e. to induce them to devote themselves toattain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel as opposed tomore philosophically universal tasks such as the Hindu and Buddhist sages proposed.It was my own attainment that compelled me to extend the scope of my Work to thefunction of the Logos of the Aeon much as has been explained in the passages of thisChapter just discussed. The two most important works of strictly inspired originwhich I have produced are LXV and VII and it now becomes clear that it is naturaland necessary that this should be so. For Liber LXV covers every possible point thatmay arise in connection with the Grade of Adeptus Minor, and Liber VII of MagisterTempli.As to Liber VII, this is not quite correct. The book contains several keys that leadto the study of Liber AL as the true Book for Magistri Templi, to which Liber VII isbut an introduction. This, by the way, is true of all of Aleister Crowley’s writings afterhe finally accepted the Book of the Law: all his works became Commentaries uponIt.61. I too am the Soul of the desert; thou shalt seek me yet again in thewilderness of sand.61­63. Beginning with verse 54 the subject of this Chapter and indeed of the wholebook has undergone a process of modification. Perviously it had been concernedalmost exclusively with the relation between the Angel and the man, the only varietybeing due to the division of the man for convenience into Nephesch, Ruach, and soon. Indeed if we identify the Angel with Jechidah it might be fair to say that LiberLXV is nothing but an extended comment upon Column LXVII of Liber 777. Butnow we reach firstly the consciousness of the Universe in its totality and then the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"peculiar relation of 666 with his fellow men. We have seen that his function in the lifeof the Planet has been defined, and it is consequently not unnatural that the Angelshould indicate the actual physical condition of His future relations with 666.This interpretation by A.C. is totally wrong, and had he been a less advancedInitiate might have led him to personal disaster. As it was, the pressure of his truebusiness­being a focus and radiating source of the Law of Θελημα ­ soon took hismind away from personal interpretations of physical conditions of future meetingswith his Angel.The reader should discount, in the Commentaries that follow, any reference to thepersonal interests of the scribe Aleister Crowley.The Angel declares Himself to be the Soul of the Desert. This remark may betaken generally as a reference to His attribution to the Path of ג which joins Ketherand Tiphereth crossing the Abyss or Desert whose essential characteristic is theabsence of a soul. See Liber 418, 10th Aethyr. Choronzon is defined as soullessness.Protean as are the forms of his appearance this quality is common to them all thatthere is no essence behind them. They are the Qliphoth (shells or husks), devoid ofmeaning or substance because mere categories uninformed by any individuality. גincidentally means a camel ‘the ship of the desert’. Cf.

Foolish Rabbins have included this symbol in their listof demons. To the well­fed Pharisee as to the modern bourgeois nothing seems morefrightful than solitude in which the mind is compelled to face reality. Such people fearnothing so much as the wilderness. The very legend of their tribe deals with the “landof milk and honey”, the Promised Land, the wish phantasm of the sensual.Observe that this is merely a matter of point of view. V:59­62. What is to the smugJew with his Oedipus complex the extreme abomination is to us a “land beyondhoney and spice and all perfection,” though we call it ‘Naught.’ We consider them‘weary ones’ and their ideal of comfort and civilisation as ‘old grey land’. Degustibus non est disputandum. But there is a criterion in this case by which we candetermine whether we or they have chosen the better part. For it is evident that nocondition of existence can be really satisfactory if its joy is liable to be disturbed. Thequestion is whether its nature is harmonious with that of the Universe. For stabilitydepends thereon. We should find consequently that the ideal of the bourgeois isrepose and his conception of the Cosmos static. Now we find that this is not the case.The Universe is a constant flux. To desire repose is thus contrary to Nature herself.We accept this fact and define the Black Brothers directly as those who seek to checkthe course of events. The bourgeois is for us therefore a clumsy ignorant amateurBlack Magician. Our idea of joy is unchecked free motion, and the stability of our joyis assured by our very conception of Yesod. We find the change the more fixed weare in our joy. (Refer to the 11th and 3rd Aethyrs, and several similar passages in theHoly Books.) We are guaranteed by the nature of things in themselves whereas thebourgeois is constantly upset by such trivial matters as the efflux of time and the rateof exchange.The hardships of desert life and in particular its psychological horror indicate thecorrespondence emphatically.Apart from this reference to Alastor the word again recalls the historic events ofthe 3rd of December, 1909 e.v. at Bou Saada when 666 ceremonial underwent theInitiation into the Grade of Magister Templi. This points the allusion. From this it isevident that the import of these verses is entirely practical. They are not to be taken ina mystical sense, but as definitely predicting a Great Magical Retirement, to beundertaken by 666 at some period in the future. There do not seem to be any clearindications as to the date of this journey, but its conditions are laid down withconsiderable precision and the actual place the ‘consummation’ is described in termswhich should leave no room for doubt.The student should refer to the accounts of such events as the finding of the VillaCaldarezzo if he would learn to interpret the instructions communicated by means ofvisions and oracles.I have always taken this passage in this sense. I have expected to find sooner orlater that my circumstances were such that afterwards it would be found to have beena precise and exact fulfilment of this prediction. At the moment of writing this"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Comment some such journey is actually in contemplation and it may be part of thepreparation for that journey that I should have been moved to devote my energies tothe analysis of this Book. It is therefore immediately pertinent to my own work andshould be exceedingly useful in the most practical way to the student to trace out asminutely as possible the probable bearings of the symbolism of the text.In view however of the extreme importance of this Great Magical Retirement itwould be in the last degree improper to discuss it coram populo while yet inchoate.Moreover it is a well­known characteristic of all true prediction that while some of theallusions should be intelligible at the time of utterance so that its general bearingshould be unmistakeable there should be other passages altogether beyond thepossibility of interpretation until the occurence of the event foretold. In Macbeth andPart II of Henry VI, Act I, Scene 4 and Act IV, Scene 1, lines 30­35, and Act V,Scene II, lines 67­69 illustrate this condition. The student is also referred to theinterpretation and fulfilment of CCXX III:47. No amount of investigation would haveenabled me to say in what sense the words of the prediction would justify themselves.62­63. In the case of the Great Magical Retirement indicated in these verses thedata are singularly precise. Even in the matter of the effect of the Work, verse 63,there are a number of unusual expressions — ‘bedecked’, ‘anointed’, Consummation’— which are at present and must be, until the event, perfectly obscure. The verse issuperficially the maximum of vagueness. These expressions might apply to almostany form of intercourse between Aiwass and the Beast. When the Retirement is amatter of history it will appear that these express with the almost mathematicalprecision the nature of the orgia, and that no other words exist which could replacethem adequately. This circumstance should be irrefutable proof to those whounderstand anything of the laws of Nature expecially in regard to the doctrine ofprobability that Aiwass possesses the power of foretelling future events and bringingthem to pass in conformity with His plans. The vagueness of the expression at presentis evidently an essential part of this proof. For if I were able to interpret them withcertainty in the striking and convincing way which time will permit me to do, I shouldbe able by the exercise of prudence to arrange for the fulfilment of the prediction andthereby destroy its evidential character. (This paragraph was dictated by me to FraterO.P.V. on the evening of 17th July, 1923, E.V. (In fact 10­10.20 p.m. Tuesday, 17thJuly, 1923, at the Hotel Au Souffle du Zephir, Marsa Plage, Tunisia). (An XIX, Solin 24 Cancer, Luna in 14 Virgo). The passage will be shown for confirmation toEddie.)I.e., Frater O.P.V.. This “prediction” of course never came to pass. The verserefers to verses 52­53, of which it is the ocnclusion. The ‘great lord and a comely’ isthe outgrowth of the little boy ‘like a wanton goat’ the ‘woman clad in gassamer andgold and having the stars of her har’ is the late ‘unfledged eaglet’. They have grownup, that is, developed, and the Adept returns to meet the Angel ‘armed, like theGoddess’. The ‘land of pertilence and evil’ refers to Cap. I, vv. 45­46; the river of a‘foolish city forgotten’ is the source of the human, material mind, perhaps the verybrain.There is something about the Initiatic Process that must be understood. Initiations"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"are not necessarily complete on all planes at any one time, and need to be passedagain and again until all planes are covered. This is not a rule; there is no rule ininitiation, it is the most personal thing possible, and it must vary with the Movementof the Universe itself. And Universe can be interpreted as the inner, subjectiveuniverse, or the Human Universe, or the External Universe, or the Solar Universe,or the Cosmic Universe, and so on. Some Initiations may be complete on all planes,but the same individual might have to pass through his next Initiation several times,each time on a different plane.The Initiation of the Neophyte reflects the Initiation of the Minor Adept; theInitiation of the Zelator reflects the Initiation of the Magister Templi; the Initiation ofthe Practicus reflects the Initiation of the Magus; the Initiation of the Philosophusreflects the Initiation of the Ipsissimus. The process starts again with the DominusLiminis, whose circumstances and ordeals are analogous to those of the Probationer,Again, the Initiation of the Adeptus Minor is analogous to that of the Neophyte,though on a higher plane, and the Initiation of the Adeptus Major is analogous tothat of the Practicus, and the Initiation of the Adeptus Exemptus is analogous to thatof the Philosophus. (The Initiation of the Aelator is analogous, here, to the point ofview of the Adeptus Minor Within.) The Crossing of the Abyss is again analogous toProbation and to the position and progress of the Dominus Liminis.In practice this means that it is impossible to pass through an Initiation withoutproducing a reflexive awakening in parts of one’s higher consciousness which arenot particularly concerned with the initiation per se (at least in appearance). This ofcourse is not true, really, since we are living porcesses of energy and every part of usis connected with every other part, but we hope the reader will understand what wemean. An Initiation reverberates on all parts of us, but concentrates especially on acertain faculty on a certain lane.The result of this is that we must go through the same Initiation again and againuntil it becomes so perfect that we no longer become conscious of having undergoneit. Thus did Aleister Crowley, for instance, run through the grades of the Outer withastonishing rapidity. These Grades he had conquered, repeatedly, in past lives, untilthey had become part of his Magickal Memory, that is to say, of his Magickal Self.An example at everybody’s disposal: the Crossing of the Abyss must be undergoneon two planes: that of Nephesch and that of Ruach. This does not mean that a personwho undergoes the Crossing from Nhephesch’s point of view does not cross inRuach; but when the Ruach exists in function of Nephesch, as is the case withintensely mystical temperaments, for instance, Ruach passes by virtue of Nephesch.Nevertheless, to become a balanced Adept, the person in question will have toundergo the Crossing again from the point of view of Ruach; and will have to do thisin a new incarnation, where his or her temperament becomes more balanced invirtue of training in the positive sciences, or environmental conditioning, or geneticboosting from one of the parents or both, unless he or she is strong enough to controlNephesch, train Ruach, and cross twice in the same incarnation. Such cases dohappen. The Instruction referring to the Crossing in Nephesch is Liber 156, and theInstruction referring to the Crossing in Ruach is Liber 474 (Os Abysmi vel Da’ath)."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Since we define evolution as expansion of consciousness, and measure SpiritualBeings by the extent of their awareness, we must admit that a Magister Templi whoshould cross the Abyss only in Nephescfh (or rather, from Nephesch’s point of view)is inferior to a Magister Templi who crossed the Abyss from both points of view,Nephesch and Ruach. (This, again, is not quite true, for it depends on the depth andscope of the Stars involved, as for instance an Albert Einstein with just one collegedegree and a Joe Schmoe with several, but again we hope the reader will understandthe limitations under which we must struggle to communicate ideas like these.)We can safely say that even the greatest of the Stars will try, again and again, toincrease its awareness on all planes in the most all­encompassing way possible. “MyAdepts stand upright, their head above the heavens, their feet below the hells.”The Adept in LXV has just complained of the Error of the Beginning, which simplymeans that he has not yet perfected his Initiation (there was no error at thebeginning, and there was no beginning! Cf. Cap. II, vv. 17­22); and has asked theAngel in what circumstances he may expect full satisfaction from the Knowledge andConversation. The answer is given very explicitly, and we suggest that seriousstudents meditate and practice.62. At thy right hand a great lord and a comely; at thy left hand a woman cladin gossamer and gold and having the stars in her hair. Ye shall journey far intoa land of pestilence and evil; ye shall encamp in the river of a foolish cityforgotten; there shall ye meet with Me.63. There will I make Mine habitation; as for bridal will I come bedecked andanointed; there shall the Consummation be accomplished.64. O my darling, I also wait for the brilliance of the hour ineffable, when theuniverse shall be like a girdle for the midst of the ray of our love, extendingbeyond the permitted end of the endless One.The language of this verse is curiously extravagant yet curiously exact. Theimpression is that the Angel is doing violence to the language by compellingambiguous glyphs to assume definite form. Refer to III:12 and my Comment uponthem. Verses 64­65 apparently fix the connotation of the word ‘consummation’ inverse 63.It is difficult to assign any exact reason for my impression, but that impression isthat the love will extend no more as hitherto merely to Tiphereth (Liber LXV) or toBinah (Liber VII) but to Kether and the Ain Soph (Limitless).The endless One seemed to be Kether. At least, I cannot think of any alternative. Itmay legitimately be described as endless on account of its unity. But in that case whatmeaning can we assign to ‘permitted end’? The suggestion is that there are really twoends, one permitted, i.e., arbitrarily assigned, the other inherent in its nature. Thereference might then be either to Malkuth or to the Ain.Alternatively, ‘end’ may not represent ‘finis’ but ‘telos’. The permitted end may be"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"paraphrased the lawful goal.Again ‘endless’ might be taken as equivalent to objectless. The canon of perfectionof will is given in CCXX, I, 44: AL I.44: “For pure will, unassuaged of purpose,delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.”Kether as unity may be described as endless because it is itself a result, a product of‘love under will,’ the resolution of the Dyad.The Universe is compared to a ‘girdle for the midst of the ray of our love,’ as if thatray were a limitless line of light. The totality of manifested existence would then bethe boundary of the [simple/central SECTION] of this love.This state of things will arise when each of the two lovers has become identifiedwith the infinite idea of which he is naturally a (centralized or constricted) particularcase. In other words, the Angel and the Adept will each have attained to self­annihilation or dissolution in the being of Nuit and Hadit respectively, and thus thepoint of junction, the bridal chamber, will be in the midst of the Universe of the finitephenomena precipitated by the union of the infinite complementaries. The Universewill in fact be determined by the ray which represents the will to love of these two.The phenomenon is therefore parallel with that of the fundamental act of creation.This formula is so profound and important that it must be apprehended andassimilated by study of the theories concerning it in CCXX before the student canexpect to attach any truly definite meaning to the ideas which I have endeavoured totranslate into the language of intellectual concepts.Besides all this there is undoubtedly a Neschamic or Samadhic meaning to verse64 which is not in any way susceptible of intellectual interpretation unless by aMagister Templi who has made a special effort to construct a language capable ofbeing the Abyss between Neschamah and Ruach, between the Samadhic and thenormal conditions of consciousness.65. Then, O thou heart, will I the serpent eat thee wholly up; yea, I will eat theewholly up.The conclusion­and be it remembered that this whole chapter concerns itself withthe expression of the Unconscious Will — is that the ‘Consummation’ of the K. andC. of the H.G.A. whose connotation is fixed by verse 64 is the complete andirrevocable absorption of the human consciousness of the Adept in that of his H.G.A.The symbol of the heart i.e. of the passive passionate life of the Adept is consumed(consummation) in the divine and eternal life represented by the serpent. The serpentis a vibration of energy whose complementary curves appear as death and life. It isthe change of direction at the solstitial points of the curves which produce the illusionof stasis and therefore invite nomenclature on the part of those who fail to understandthe continuity of the line, seeing as they do only a minute arc of it. The idea iscognate when the serpent is taken as in verse 54. Whatever glyph be chosen thethought is the same. The consummation implies the transformation of thereverberatory vibration of human life into the continuous serpentine spiral vibration ofthat pure energy which is not assuaged by its results, which neither lusts for its results"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"nor is assuaged by them.CHAPTER 5This Chapter is attributed to the element of Spirit; it deals consequently with theharmonization, in terms of humanity, of the Four Blind Forms of Energy. In previouschapters the man 666, being so gross and complex an idea, had no natural right to anyplace in the relations of his Angel, and the Adept which he has selected and perfectedin himself. 666, ‘the scribe’ (etc., as he is called in various passages) must formulate alink between himself and those others. (See Cap. v. 31, vv. 41­49,etc.)The four elements are usually called “blind” in occult tradition, but the term ismisleading. What they are, actually, is automatic: they work on the Law of Balance,or Adjustment, and take no account of such qualities as “goodness” or “badness”on the part of people, as for instance in the fact that if you drink arsenic by mistake orif you drink it with the conscious intention of committing suicide you will equally diein either case unless purely mechanistic measure are taken to neutralize the effect ofthe arsenic.The laws of nature, insofar as so­called “profane science” studies them, are theBlind Operations of the Elements. Consciousness, human or otherwise, is onlybeginning to be taken into account now, and wise scientists still isolate the purelymechanistic form of elemntal permutation in order to establish “laws”. Left tothemselves, the Elements will follow a certain pattern of behavior. The enunciation ofthis pattern is the quotation of scientific laws.The introduction of the Element of Spirit produces a change in all patterns. This isthe so­called “supernatural” element in phenomena, which is now beginning to bestudied in such scientific new branches of knowledge as parapsychology, genetics,ecology and mathematics. Of course it is not “supernatural”. It only seems to be soby the introduction of factors that alter the normal behavior of the Four “Blind”Forces.There is, and both scientists and students of occultism should keep this in mind, amechanistic or “blind” element of behavior in Akasha itself. Its faculty consists inharmonizing the lower four in relation to itself, but this harmonization may occurwithout voluntary exertion of the part of individuals whose constitution partakes ofthe Five, be they from whatever line of evolution. Also, there are elementals of Spirit.Certain orders of “demons” and “angels” pertain to Elemental classification, andonly seem to be Microcosms because of the peculiasr integrating or harmonizingproperty of Akasha. It hsould be kept in mind that isnce the Four originate in Akasha,it is natural that it should have this influence on them. It is analogous to the propertyof valence in chemistry. Recognition of true “humanhood” in beings on the AstralPlane depends on the capacity to pierce beyond this mechanistic quality of Akasha."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Unless the Sixth Element is present in a Being in the subtler planes, this being is notqualified to be dealth with on a level of equality with normal mankid.

Cf. Chapter I:41, ‘the echo of your kisses’;because the reality of such relations is beyond articulate apprehension; one can beconscious only of the reflection (in terms of the Ruach) of Neschamic intuition.The fact accounts for the impotent babble of the Mystics of old time: they arecompelled to rely on rhetorical devices like the use of such words as ‘ineffable’ andof magnificently mysterious metaphors.

The Pearl is zro (see the Bagh­i­Muattar; TheLost Continent, etc. a cloudy Nebula containing the Rashith­ha­Gilgalim of the newUniverse created of the Quintessence of the Substance of the Unity of the Angel andthe Adept, expressed therefrom by virtue of “love under will” at the moment ofRapture.In Chapter I, the Chapter of Earth, the scribe or prophet 666 is wroth, importunate,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"laborious, and ashamed. He had not succeeded in establishing the proper relations.He has now succeeded: “let me listen” is not a demand or request. It implies thepoweras in a true subjunctive.

Am not I the flying spark of light whirled away by the great wind of yourperfection?He continues with absolute confidence to indicate the source of his powers. Henotes that the starry heaven (Nuit) is ‘shaken’ i.e., its continuum is disrupted by theChymical Marriage. At the other extreme his own static condition is destroyed.Heunderstands himself not as a fixed being of wrath but as the “the flying spark oflight” — a pure dynamic vibration. This conception, first formulated in Liber CCXX,and explained already in this Comment, is in fact the first condition of what theBuddhists call Samma Dithi — right views. So long as a man thinks of himself as abeing rather than as an energy he attributes to himself not, as the profane supposestability, but stagnation, which is death. Moreover this spark is practically identifiedwith the rapture of the Chymical Marriage.3. Yea, cried the Holy One, and from Thy spark will I the Lord kindle a greatlight; I will burn through the great city in the old and desolate land; I willcleanse it from its great impurity.It has been explained that the absolute surrender of the false self is the firstcondition of the existence of the True Self. While 666 seemed to himself a separateexistence he remained impotent. Immediately he understands himself as “whirledaway by the great wind of your perfection.” The Angel tells him of his success onjust that plane of illusion which he has abandoned. The sorrow and failure of 666arise from his contemplation of his fellow men, of the imperfection and wretchedness,the weariness of existence of this planet. He had found that his personal efforts, so farfrom remedying the mischief, tended rather to increase it. Now however, that hispersonality has been destroyed, it becomes efficient. It is impossible to change anyfixed state by working upon it from the same level. At most one can rearrange itscharacter by the formula of ALIM (see Book 4, Part III, Chapter IV), the formula ofwitchcraft. However one may manipulate the digits of a number divisible by 9, itremains a multiple of that number. (Consider attentively the whole doctrine connectedwith the number 9. The references have already been indicated in this Comment.).The world of Assiah is a crystallization of the Atziluthic idea Briah and Yetzirah. Itcan be effectively modified by the import of some other Atziluthic quintessence. It istherefore useless for 666 as being of Assiah to attempt to redress it. He can only do soby exalting himself to Atziluth by the Attainment of the Knowledge andConversation of the H.G.A., and approaching Assiah through Briah from Yetzirah.The Angel spontaneously promises 666 that his True Will shall be made operative.The minute spark of his individuality shall be enkindled to a great light and this lightshall consume the impurity of the ‘grey city in the old and desolate land’."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"This Book was written down in London, and the apparent reference in the firstinstance is to that city. The text may mean that in some way or other 666 will become‘a great light’, a portentious phenomenon pregnant with destruction in the eyes of itsinhabitants.It is a pity the Angel did not choose Tokyop, or Los Angeles, where the pollutionproblem is rather harder!... Of course this “grey city” is the same referred to Cap.IV.62, and Cap III.21. And the process of becoming ‘a whirling spark of light’ isgeneral to all Adepti Minori, to which this Book is dedicated. The above paragraph isan example of that ‘taintness’ in the scirbe mentioned in Cap. IV.59­60, where againthe city is mentioned. He looks around and finds himself ignored (except by hisenemies, who revile yhim, try to entrap him, and to disperse his efforts) by all. Nowonder he yearns for some symptom of his importance!On this interpretation it is not clear what is meant by “its great impurity” or how themanifestation of 666 should “cleanse it therefrom.” The proper method of exegesiswhich immediately suggests itself is to collate the passages in the Holy Books whichrefer to that city, and to study them in the light of the historical events in which 666has taken part. Even so, despite certain possibly significent incidents it would appearthat some such event is still in the future.There is of course no sure token that this interpretation is valid. An alternativemight be sought in the numerical value of the Greek equivalent of “grey city” or itmay transpire that some city has a peculiar right to be designated as grey.Further, the allusion may be strictly poetic metaphor; “grey city” may mean nomore than a place where men assemble, a gloomy, foggy place where men assemble.(Vide Cap. IV vv. 59­60)Readers are seriously warned to refrain from trying to find actual material placesor happenings relating to themselves as persons in any of the Holy Books. SeveralAspirants, obsessed in this manner, met ruin, and at least one very high intiiateseriously heoparidzed his work by flaling into this trap. The only material citymentioned in the Holy Books is Cairo, in AL III.11. Otherwise the word is used in astrictly symbolical sense. Although ‘grey’ is the color of Chokmah, it has also anormal sense of people without enthusiasm or great intelligence or finer feelings­people such as the ‘grey men’ of J.B. Priestley’s amusing allegory. There is arelation ship between those ‘grey men’ and Kipling’s poem on the ‘Gods of htreCopy­book Headings’, but we are personally inclined to the idea that Kipling’sconcept is nobler.The insistence of the scribe Aleister Crowley in these last few comments inidentifying himself with 666, of whom he is but the pale reflex in teyh ‘old greyshpere’, shows how depressed he was at the time of writing by the circumstances ofhis material environment. As a matter of fact, the influence of 666 in the world hasjust started. Future centuries may see a type of ‘success’ that Crowley himself wouldhave considered too much. Cf.

There is a quite different referenceto the Equinox of the Gods, ABRAHADABRA, the magical Formula of the Aeon(not to be confused with the Word of the Law of the Aeon) represents theestablishment of the pillar or phallus of the 5 Alephs. Aleph is a void or kteis, beingthe Atu marked 0.The general symbol is repeated in particular terms. Isis and Osiris governrespectively the two Aeons (of the Kether and the Dying God) through which wehave passed. The fulfilment of Asi by Asar indicates that their operation is complete,their conjunction having resulted in the appearance of Horus (Heru­ra­Ha in his twinaspects (a) Force and Fire, and (b) Silence).The verse tells us that that has come to pass which it was the Great Work of 666, inhis official relation to the A.∙.A.∙. as opposed to his personal career as a magician, toproclaim.The “Animal Soul of things”, i.e., the Nephesch of the World. The Lord of theAeon represents more than a new stage in the progressive infiltration of the darknessof matter by light.

Three hundredyears ago, such theories would have been awarded, at least in the West, withreligious persecution and possbily torture and burning alive. Darwin himselfexperienced all kinds of attacks from existing religions. Including Marxism.6. Through the midnight thou art dropt, O my child, my conqueror, my sword­girt captain, O Hoor! and they shall find thee as a black gnarl’d glittering stone,and they shall worship thee.The symbolism of midnight and of the “black gnarled glittering stone” suggests areference to Atu XVIII where Kephra the Beetle, the Sun of Midnight, appearstravelling in his bark under the Heaven. (The stone is everywhere conventionallyaccepted as a symbol of ☉.) Despite the promise of the symbol — “there is a buddingmorrow in midnight” — this first appearance of Horus is obscure and frightful. YetHe is found in this form and worshipped.The nature of the symbol is rendered unmistakable by the additional epithets; a“child” indicates the irresponsible and innocent mischievousness. “My conqueror”further defines Him as overcoming the opposition of the inertia or natural prejudice ofthe ‘old guard’ of the profane.

For it is as the abyss of the Arcanum that is opened in the secret Place ofSilence.“My prophet”, as in verse 4, refers to 666. Cf. Liber CCXX I:26, etc. This title isgiven to him more frequently than any other. The term ‘prophet’ or ‘forth­speaker’ iscontrasted with ‘The Beast’ which is connected with my function in Tiphereth,implying my manhood, kingship, my mastery of ecstasy, and as fulfilling the functionreferred to in the Apocalypse so far as the confusion caused by the corruption of thetext of that Book permits us to calculate.The title “priest” refers to the function of serving the Gods proclaimed in LiberCCXX, and administering the Sacrament (the new Magick, formula A.∙.A.∙., etc).The title “prince” may be connected with the attribution to Tiphereth, sinceMicroprosopus is the Vau of Tetragrammaton, Vau having the value of 6, andcorresponding to the four princes (sometimes called Emperors) of the Tarot.The “prophecy” here mentioned is first of all CCXX Chapter III, this book itself,and various other poems, essays and rituals. Liber 418, Aethyr I.The second paragraph indicates Horus in his active and adult aspects. The studentis referred to the complete exposition of the meaning of the letter Aleph, in particularto that part of it in which it is explained that ‘the babe in the egg of blue, Harpocratesin whom all power is latent, he being Harpocrates, Bacchus Diphues, Zeus,Baphomet, Parzifal as the ‘pure fool’, the Great Fool of the Celtic legends, the childHermes, etc., in the first stage of pantomorphous innocence, develops at puberty intoParzifal the Knight­errant, who obtains the Crown by winning the King’s daughter (amystery on which the actual customs of many primitive races are founded).

At the same time his present appearance is in a sense an originalphenomenon. For He is represented in CCXX as the third to Nuit and Hadit, nayrather as the first, Nuit and Hadit being wholly beyond the comprehension of any butThe Beast and his Bride and “the winners of the Ordeal X” (CCXX III:22). He istherefore shown as springing spontaneously. There is no reference to Isis and Osiristhe traditional father and mother of Horus in the Egyptian theology.‘Around thee the maidens shall dance, and bright babes be born unto them.’ One isreminded of the almost universal practice of circumambulating or dancing round thelingam, Maypole, or other cognate symbol of the creative faculty. The voice ofscandal suggests that the women who adopted this rite made it effective byphysiological precautions. But even so the aptness (congruity) of the two methods isevident and philoprogenitiveness is justified of her children no less than Wisdom. ThePuritans rightly asserted that the Maypole was a lingam and May­day a Priapicfestival.The remaining section of the verse is extremely obscure. Humility seems to bediscountenanced by The Book of the Law as incompatible with the properunderstanding of oneself as a star, a king, or sovereign being, no less than the greatestof the Gods. It is further likely to lead to Sin, i.e., Restriction, since the humble areliable to fail to assert their independence and their right. From this it would appearthat in some sense or other humility must be a positive virtue whose climax in an“ecstacy of abasement” is no less worthy of respect than any other form of trance. SeeI Ching, XV, on the Ch’ien Hexagram. This Hexagram is composed of the trigram ofthe female principle ☷ modifying the symbol ☶ of earth. See the last Trigram inLiber Trigrammaton. “Therefore was the end of it sorrow; yet in that sorrow a sixfoldstar of glory whereby they might see to return unto the stainless Abode; yea, unto thestainless Abode.” (Liber XXVII.) Abasement means movement towards the base,towards the foundation, Yesod, which represents the resolution of the antinomyStability — Change. Observe the sympathetic harmony of all these symbols andcompare them further with the doctrine of the Tao Teh King with regard to thesupreme strength of water, low­lying and the apotheosis of weakness in the senseunderstood in the Tao Teh King throughout. I take this opportunity, moreover, toquote The Book of Lies.PEACHESSoft and hollow, how thou dost overcome the hard and full!It dies, it gives itself; to Thee is the fruit!Be thou the Bride; thou shalt be the Mother hereafter.To all impressions thus.

The humility of Uriah Heep andPecksniff, of Tartuffe, the “crucified Jesus” of the Y.M.C.A., C.I.C.C.U., and similarassociations of the herd, which goes with hypocrisy, envy, low, cunning, and thatwhole complex of fear qualities which are characteristic of those who knowthemselves inferior. It is curious to reflect that in England we associate this frame ofmind with Christianity, especially with Romish Christianity, whereas on theContinent those precise recessions are attributed to Judaism.However, this type of ‘humility’ is not related to that false, egoic humility that hehas been speaking about; it is merely social postruing, adopted by all minoritieseverywhere as a defense. In countries where Roman Catholicism predominates onlythe false humility described before is shown, we should rather say boasted, and thisonly towards “God”, the “Virgin”, or “Jesus”, as the case may be; the inhabitants,and particularly their priests, showing a patronizing (or hostile, though the hostility isopenly expressed only in their inner circles) attitude to other relitgions. As to the Jew,he ahs been singing new tunes lately, but is still, as a rule, humble (or tries to be)towards his concept of God.In this matter of humility as a defensive mimetism the serious tudent is referred toAL III.9 and to The Book of Lies, Chapter 19, “The Leopard and the Deer”, and theCommentary thereon by A.C.Note that this is realistic adaptation to circumstances, not false humility that hopesto deceive God, or who else, into “rewarding” the devotee. See also AL II.58­60.The “humble ones” in this passage are evidently employing a definite magicalformula with their absolute energy and confidence."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The serious student is referred to AL I.49 and the Commentaries thereon.

But there are two approaches to theSecret Chiefs: one, you recognize that you are potentially one of them, and you try toshow yourself worthy of their company and their support. Another, you are consciousof your total worthlessness, but you trust in the generosity of Someone greater thanyourself. The key to success in both attitudes is utter sincerity. The secret of thesecond formula is that you couldn’t be conscious of your worthlessness if you werelookintg at it from the plane of flesh. Cf. VII I.41­43, “If the fool would persist in hisfolly, he would become wise.” And those inclined to criticize the Lord of the Aeon forhis choice of company would do well to read The Hawk and the Babe (The WingedBeetle) and ponder, particularly, the last stanza.The results of the manifestation of Horus are now said “to transcend the Knownand the Unknown with somewhat that hath no name.” It is quite clear that this is so,but far from obvious why the fact should be so firmly emphasised and explained,especially in such unusual and obscure terminology. The word “it” in the lastsentence may refer to the nameless “somewhat” or to “all this”.The “secret Place of Silence” is the womb of Nuit or “egg of blue” which concealsthe babe Harpocrates.The “Arcanum that is opened” may perhaps be paraphrased “the secret truth that ismanifested.” The Abyss may always be taken to signify “absence of ground.” It is theform or means of manifestation of anything which is not so manifested. Alternatively,it may be the abyss that is opened, that is to say made available for investigation.“All this” has no name because it is “the unity uttermost showed” (see CCXXIII:37) of Horus. His identity absorbs these diverse phenomena with equalabsoluteness. In the perfect purity of the child, or pure fool, (Parzifal, asked hisname,answers “Ich weiss nicht”) all differences vanish for ever; see CCXX I:4 and22­23. This verse 7 may therefore be summarised somewhat as follows:The proclamation of Horus by 666 will enable every person to fulfil his properfunction of True Will, and by so doing to reach the perfection of his own nature,whereas the illusion of dividuality is entirely destroyed. As it is written in LiberCCXX I.44­5.“For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is everyway perfect.”“The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!”8.

Cf. Cap. II:4­6, 7­16, III:4­12, 40­48, IV:2­3, 5, 33­37, 42­44. See also Liber VII, several passages, which maybe discovered by the right ingenium of the Exempt Adept.9. But I have burnt within thee as a pure flame without oil. In the midnight Iwas brighter than the moon; in the daytime I exceeded utterly the sun; in thebyways of thy being I flamed, and dispelled the illusion.Despite the above, the Holy Guardian Angel has always indwelt the being of theAdept, not even needing the nourishment represented by “oil.” (For this symbol seeBook 4, Part II, Chapter 5.)The Angel exceeds alike Sol, Luna and Agni, the three principles which (in theHindu symbolism) come into course successively during each twenty­four hours, thusdetermining the character of Dhyana attained at any given period of the day.10. Therefore thou art wholly pure before Me; therefore thou art My virginunto eternity.The relation of the man with his Angel is independent of his acts qua man. HisNephesch, considered as in relation to the non­Ego, is incapable of interfering withhis true Nephesch.This is utter idocy. The relation of the man with his Angel totall depends on his‘binding together the words and the deeds so that in all is one Thought’­confer verse58.

They shall change in their destruction, even as two dark stars that crashtogether in the abyss, and blaze up in an infinite burning.The reference seems to be a theory (at present unfashionable) of the formation ofnebulae. The point here is simply that the intimate contact of two apparently ‘dark’ or‘evil’ ideas leads to their transmutation into Light. It is “love under will.”14. All this while did Adonai pierce my being with his sword that hath fourblades; the blade of the thunderbolt, the blade of the Pylon, the blade of theserpent, the blade of the Phallus.Adonai: אדני. Aleph is the swastika or Thunderbolt by shape: Daleth means Dooror Pylon: Nun refers to Scorpio, the Serpent: Yod is the Phallus (Yod of IHVH —considered as the inmost and simplest idea).15. Also he taught me the holy unutterable word Ararita, so that I melted thesixfold gold into a single invisible point, whereof naught may be spoken.See Liber Ararita (DCCCXIII sub figura DLXX) for this. The symbolic mode ofwriting the Word is [to place all the Hebrew letters of the work ARARITA on thepoints of the Hexagram (non­unicursal) with Aleph on the top point and movingwiddershins: Resh; Aleph; Tav; Aleph and Resh­Yod is then placed in the center.A separate volume might be — and should be and shall be! — written upon theArcana of this Hieroglyph.16. For the Magistry of this Opus is a secret magistry; and the sign of the masterthereof is a certain ring of lapis­lazuli with the name of my master, who am I,and the Eye in the Midst thereof.The reference is to a material ring: see The Spirit of Solitude for some account of it.The lettering about the Eye is V.V.V.V.V. See Liber LXI vv. 22 sqq. These are theinitials of the Motto of 666 as Magister Templi, 8 °= 3▫“Vi Veri Univers Vivus Vici” also V is the Latin letter signifying 5, and its value (וor ) is 6. The allusion is thus to 5 °= 6▫, the Great Work. Again, the arrangements ofthe letters on the lapis lazuli indicated the Pentagram.17. Also He spake and said: This is a secret sign, and thou shall not disclose itunto the profane, nor unto the neophyte, nor unto the zelator, nor unto the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"practicus, nor unto the philosophus, nor unto the lesser adept, nor unto thegreater adept.18.

TheMagister Templi communicates, as such, only with Adeptus Exemptus: that isdirectly.Meaning in Samadhi, of course. The Magister Templi is a Spiritual Being; wemight even say, he is a God. He cannot communicate directly with any initiate belowthe level of the Crossing of the Abyss. He can communicate indirectly, through theman in whom he is incarnated, but this is like sending a telegram to your favorite girl(or favorite boy). Hardly the same as a kiss. However, true lovers are content withvery little, especially if it is a token of what is to come. Or so says the Song of Songs,and the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita, and a few thousand other texts,including poems. (Perhaps I should say million, if I include poems.)19. Accept the worship of the foolish people, whom thou hatest. The Fire is notdefiled by the altars of the Ghebers, nor is the Moon contaminated by theincense of them that adore the Queen of Night.Again personal and practical to 666. I have done much mischief by insisting onmaking everything clear to people who were not ready for it.Ghebers: fire­worshippers in Persia. (See Compte d Gobineau: Trois Ans en Asie.)Generally, the abuse of a formula does not injure the passive party, who isunconcerned, and incurs no responsibility.There is a more general meaning, and we feel that A.C. is accusing himselfunduly. When you get to a certain plane, you become conscious of the fact that youare the source of the spiritual energy from which a number of religions draw theircontact­if any­with the higher planes. You can then become rather irritated with theidiocy of those worshippers, particularly since you know that you are the worshippedpart. As an example: Crowley’s Magickal Name as Minor Adept Within was SATAN­JEHESHUA. You can imagine what he felt like on contemplating, on one side, thehypocritical sobs of the Christiests, and on the other the frantic antics of theSatanists! The ‘scribe’ part of an Adept may, under these circumstances, sometimesfeel that he is responsible for the follies of the Popes or of the Messrs. Huysmans, deGuaita, et al. It is for this and many other reasons that Liber III should beassiduously practiced by the beginner. He does not know that he is going to need it,but he is. The guilt­complex can develop into mental disorder. Serious students arereferred to O.M.’s note to Frater V.I.O.’s Record, Equinox III No. 1, p. 169, starting“(1) You are emotional.” The “certain Gate” he was talking about refers to this. Theproblem arises in connection to other circumstances. Once your consciousnessbridges higher Trances, mental control becomes essential, otherwise you may go"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"mad. Incidentally, this does not refer to the Crossing of the Abyss, when you go madanyway. It refers to the initiations below the Abyss, and particularly those you incurwhen you become Dominus Liminis. The Dominis Liminis, if he is not careful, caneven think he is a Magister Templi (again!). Liber III, well conquered at thebeginning, will avoid all of these problems in the mind of the scribe. Aspirantsneglect it at their own risk. Take it from the horse’s mouth. I took three years torecover common­sense after reaching Neophyte, and seven years to recovercommon­sense after reaching Zelator. It took me less time after Adeptus Minor, butonly because I didn’t realize I ahd reached that Initiation until several years after.This wait, which delayed the Work I was supposed to do for the Order, could havebeen avoided if I had simply taken the trouble to conquer Liber III thoroughly when itwas part of my Task.20. Thou shalt dwell among the people as a precious diamond among cloudydiamonds, and crystals, and pieces of glass. Only the eye of the just merchantshall behold thee, and plunging in his hand shall single thee out and glorify theebefore men.Still personal and practical. 666 is to continue to live his normal life as a man of theworld, unrecognised for what He is save by the ‘just merchant’ the man who canrightly assess values. It is the duty and privilege of some such man to bring to 666 hisdue measure of fame.Of course, there is a more general sense. This admonition is directed at any Adept.Cf. AL II.24 and the Commentaries thereon. Not that an Adept is a Hermit, ofcourse! Still, he better start practising to become one.21. But thou shalt heed none of this. Thou shalt be ever the heart, and I theserpent will coil close about thee. My coil shall never relax throughout the fons.Neither change nor sorrow nor unsubstantiality shall have thee; for thou artpassed beyond all these.666 will (naturally) care as little for fame as he has always done formisunderstanding, abuse, and infamy. He will be wholly absorbed in His attainmentof the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. This is thesempiternal. Change, sorrow, unsubstantiality: Anicca, Dukka, Anatta; The ThreeCharacteristics. See my “Science and Buddhism” and other references.Again, the verse applies to any Adept.22.

I am thou, and the Pillar is established in the void.Compare this refrain with verses 5, 24, 25. In verse 5 the Great Work is announcedimpersonally. Here it is identified with the Attainment.We refer readers to LXV I.32­46, and the Commentaries thereon. The Work thatwas then imperfect is now accomplished. The reference to the Passage of the Aeonsof course arises from the fact that the fashioning of their ‘boat of mother­pearl’ byAiwass and 666 produced this effect in the life of mankind.24. Also thou art beyond the stabilities of Being and of Consciousness and ofBliss; for I am thou, and the Pillar is ‘stablished in the void.Being, Consciousness, Bliss: Sat, Chit, Ananda. See my writings on HinduPhilosophy. Contrast with verse 21. The attainment emancipates the Adept from allconditions soever.25. Also thou shalt discourse of these things unto the man that writeth them,and he shall partake of them as a sacrament; for I who am thou am he, and thePillar is ‘stablished in the void.The human consciousness of Aleister Crowley is to be enlightened on this point.He is to be sanctified thereby, and ‘consumed’ or ‘consummated’. This ChymicalMarriage unites him with the Angel and the Adept, Three in One and One in Three:This is the final perfection of union. Hence the repetition of the fourth time of thesymbol of the Pillar in the Void. Cf. the Four consecrations in the Neophyte Ritual ofG∴D∴.It is not Aleister Crowley­or any other ‘scribe’­who shall be consummated; it is thespiritual experience that the Angel is imparting that shall be assimilated by him. Ofcourse it is in the nature of a sacrament, as those who learn this Book by heart insincerity know. The consummation of the scribe only occurs in the Crossing of theAbyss, which is not the Operation here. Every part of the Being of the Adept must beconsecrated, integrated, harmonized: the ‘scribe’ is part of the Adept’s Being, and bythe Grace of the Angel becomes part of the Angel’s Being (the process of resonancethat we already spoke of). Eventually, he shall experience the Wrath. Cf. Liber 156,vs. 17­18. It will be noticed that the Magister Templi is not mentioned; in one sense,He does not exist yet; in another sense, the Angel has identified with Him. Cf. AL I.45again. Actually, in practice, as usual, the obtention of any Initiation simply meansthat consciousness has been raised to the plane immediatley above it; as A.C. says,you cannot modify a substance by acting upon it in its own plane. At the moment ofthe Union in Tiphereth, Binah stirs, as indeed She has at every intitiation, sincewithout Aspiration initiation is impossible, and Aspiration is symbolized by the HolyOil, which pertains to Her.It must not surprise the Practicus — “him, even!” — to find the private affairs of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"666 discussed in a Class A publication of A∴A∴ purporting to deal with the GreatWork of 5 ° = 6▫. This book is primarily concerned with the Attainment of 666 to thatGrade; and it is only because all true Attainment is so almost wholly impersonal thatits contents are actually valid for the Aspirant in general.This is not quite correct. In the first place, 666 isnot implicated in Crowley’sCommentaries; 666 as such only speaks in Publications in Class A and D of theA∴A∴, and does this, or course, through the mediacy of V.V.V.V.V. who uses Hisinstrument O.M. or P. who writes through the hand of Aleister Crowley. 666’s“private affairs” cannot be discussed because 666 has no “private affairs”­that ispart of the Curse of His Grade. Furthermore, being the Magus of the Aeon, Hisattainments are of course of general import. This is also part of the Curse... It isincorrect to say that true Attainment is almost wholly impersonal. I suppose I amdriving my readers up the walls, and I refer them to AL I.28­30, 45, 48, and 52, as Isuspect I have done before. This time please add AL II.3, 6­8, 22­23, 45­49.To give a practical example: I have found that my Initiations have followedentriely the process described by Aleister Crowley in his writings, and particularlythey have echoed at every step the insights contained in the Holy Books. Yet,although I have been able to recognize experiences from his descriptions (or Hisdescriptions, or Aiwass’s descriptions, as the case may be), and quite often have beenable to improve on my chances by grace of the warning they may provide me, mypersonal experiences in the Path remain intensely personal. I am not repeatingCrowley’s steps; I am paralleling them. The personal factor exists always, except intrance. I am not Aleister Crowley; I am Marcelo Motta, anotyher person entirely. Iam also not V.V.V.V.V.; I am antoher Magister entrely. Finally, although I amauthorized to use the Sigil and Number of the Beast, as Head of Θελημα, I am notfool enough to think , for one moment, that I am the Beast. Or at least, that Beast! Iam antoher Star entriely. This, of course, does not chage the fact that... but I referyou once more to AL I.45, as if you didn’t know!In short, Aspirants may quietly and peacefully assme that the Holy Books ofΘελημα refer to precisely that attainments they are said to refer to in the Curriculum,regardless of all mentions of Aleister Crowely, pardon me, the ‘scribe’, and hispersonal problems and experiences. More: the personal aspect makes Liber VII less‘identifiable­with’ than LXV, which refers to Coagula. The operation of producing aMagister Templi is less ‘generalizeable’. Let this be a “consolation” to those whothink that becoming a Magister Templi is to lose one’s identity. On the contrary, it isto acquire an Identity for the first time.(Of course, it may not be the identity that you would have chosen for yourself, butone can’t have everything. Only None can have it! I better stop here, lest myimmoirtal wit run away with me. Besides, I was joking for the benefit of the “blackbrethren”­but if they could understand the joke they wouldn’t be “black brethren”.They would be babes in the woods, like me.)26.

Also the limitlesssphere shall glow with the brilliance thereof."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Crown, Kether, the Abyss, either Daath or that which is beyond Malkuth.

Thou shalt rejoice in the pools of adorable water; thou shalt bedeck thydamsels with pearls of fecundity; thou shalt light flame like licking tongues ofliquor of the Gods between the pools.The pools, and the flame between them, refer to the Sephiroth and the Paths. Thegeneral meaning is that the Attainment has fitted the Adept to perform creative workin all spheres.This depends on the interpretation, and would only be true of a full Adept, that is,who had achieved the K. and C. in Tiphereth of Tiphereth of Atziluth. In any othercase, he would have to perfect his work by achieving the K. and C. again and again,“ordering up” his House, so to speak, and this the verse descirbes. The “liquor ofthe Gods” is, of course, the Elixir, and here is another hint for tantrists. The“damsels” are the Nepheschs of Aspirants whom the Adept­at that level of fullinitiation become, on his turn, an “Angel”­might take under his cahrge. See TheWake­World.28. Also thou shalt convert the all­sweeping air into the winds of pale water,thou shalt transmute the earth into a blue abyss of wine.It enables him, moreover, to perform transmutations: it is not clear why thesespecial examples should have been chosen, save on purely poetic grounds. (They arein essence Air to Water, and Earth to Fire).Not so exclusively, since wine partakes of Water, also, and the next versecompletes the sequence with Fire by mentioning the “ruddy gleams”. Of course, fullcommand of Akasha (which is given only by perfect Adeptship) enables one tocontrol fully the lower Four, and transmute them into each other. They are butmodifications of Akasha, anyway.29. Ruddy are the gleams of ruby and gold that sparkle therein; one drop shallintoxicate the Lord of the Gods my servant.For the colours in this and the last verse, Cf. CCXX: “Blue am I and gold in thelight of my bride: but the red gleam is in my eyes; & my spangles are purple &green.”The Lord of the Gods is presumably Jupiter; he may be chosen because the wholetransmutation refer to Chesed, or because of his position as the highest Sephira ofMicroprosopus.Actually, Chesed is meant here, and this process of intoxication is described in VIIin various chapters and according to various circumstances: Cf. VII II.13 (Pertinaxis, of course, Perduabo), 11­12, 40­41; III.24, 49­50, 57­58; IV.21 7­13, 36­41;VII.36, 46­49.

See, also, Atu VII in the Book of Thoth; Liber418, quoted under LUST, pg. 136­139.Why is Chesed so directly influenced? Because it is the Sephira form which manstarts the Crossing of the Abyss, and the Wine comes from the Cup of BABALON, theGuardian thereof. Cf. AL III.18­20 and the Commentaries thereon.“The Lord of the Gods my servant:” of course, in the true Initiate. The “blackbrethre” rebel against the Angel’s authority, with the results already describedelsewhere.30. Also Adonai spake unto V.V.V.V.V. saying: O my little one, my tender one,my little amorous one, my gazelle, my beautiful, my boy, let us fill up the pillarof the Infinite with an infinite kiss!30­33. The identification of the various elements into which Initiation has analysedthe original individual is now complete. The Great Work — Solve et Coagula — hasbeen accomplished. There is no distinction between the personal Attainment ofAleister Crowley and the Proclamation of the Word of the Law of Θελημα throughhim. Those who realise what this means rightly assume that it marks the end of anAeon.31. So that the stable was shaken and the unstable became still.32. They that beheld it cried with a formidable affright: The end of things iscome upon us.The “affright” comes from the element of chance involved in any change of thislatitude. Nobody knows how the Aeon will develop, not even the Magus Himself. It isnot known even whether the Lord (or Lady) of the Aeon knows. Consequently, thosewho had “fried all their seeds”, and felt quite comfortable about htings, run just asmuch danger of finding themselves in the grip of “karma” as anybody else. It is as ifyou built a nice comfortable house somewhere, with fire warnings and burglaralarms, and settled down to enjoy your Social Security and your savings, andsuddenly a dam burst, or a meteor fell, or your country declared war or wasinvaded, or there was an earthquake.33. And it was even so.34. Also I was in the spirit vision and beheld a parricidal pomp of atheists,coupled by two and by two in the supernal ecstasy of the stars. They did laughand rejoice exceedingly, being clad in purple robes and drunken with purplewine, and their whole soul was one purple flower­flame of holiness.34­40. This passage is perhaps the most obscure in the whole book.Actually, it must be so. It describes the hermits, for which see AL II.24­25.“Parricidal”. They have slain their fathers; i.e., they have won to manhood and the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"consciousness of the Independence of the Individuality.“Pomp”. They celebrate their attainment of Freedom by means of a Pageant. Theymanifest the Godhead which they have won. Atheists. “Allah’s the atheist! He ownsno Allah!” (Bagh­i­Muattar).They are free of the obsession of mortality anddependence.'Coupled'. They unite with their comrades in “love under will”, being equal andidentical despite their apparent difference. (See CCXX I:1­4, 22, 50 etc..) By virtueof the ecstasy of their common relation to Nuit.'Laugh and rejoice'. (See CCXX I:26, 58, II:9, 19­25, 35­44, 62­64, 70, III:46.)“Purple”. See CCXX I:61, II:24, 50­51. Purple is the royal colour and that ofecstasy, in particular, of the Chymical Marriage of Nuit and Hadit.35. They beheld not God; they beheld not the Image of God; therefore werethey arisen to the Palace of the Splendour Ineffable. A sharp sword smote outbefore them, and the worm Hope writhed in its death­agony under their feet.This verse carries on the idea of ‘atheists’. Cf. too Chapter I:7­9, etc. Their naturalplace being Yesod (whose colour is purple) they, having destroyed the Foundation,are risen to Hod (whose colour is also purple). See Liber 777, Column XVII, Col.XV.'Sword'. Their weapon of Intellectual Destruction.'Hope' is a crawling worm, being the token of non­realisationof one’s Self assupreme Enjoyment.36. Even as their rapture shore asunder the visible Hope, so also the FearInvisible fled away and was no more.Cf. “The City of Dreadful Night.”At a certain stage of Initiation, as long as you don’t acquire complete perception ofyour parameters, this Fear Invisible is your constant companion. There is no rationalanswer or emotional defense from it. The only remedy is AL II.45­49 and AL III.17­20. It is a matter of the Will. Ultimately, this Fear is the remnant of the Father Imagein your soul. It can only be excised by courage. Nothing else will do. Cf. LXV IV.35­37.37.

See thewhole symbolism of the Cup. See Book 4, Part II, Chapter VII. See in particularChapter III and my Comment.That is, Cap. III of this Book. There is a further initiatic connection of the freshsprings with that ‘Fountain of Living Water’ of which the Gospels speak, and, if we"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"are not mistaken, so does the Talmud, and so did the Master of Righteousness of theEssenes.

It all refers to the Quintessence in one of itsforms, or to the Mystery of the Grail, for which study Wagner’s libretto to Parzifal,Libri 156 and 418 and The Golden Bough. It was the corruption of this most ancientArcane which resulted in the outgrowth of Christism. Cf. Also Atus VII and XII inThe Book of Thoth.41. And again I was caught up into the presence of my Lord Adonai, and theknowledge and Conversation of the Holy One, the Angel that Guardeth me.The passage 34­40 was ‘in the spirit vision’. It follows 30­33. 34­40 thus becomeintelligible; it is my vision of mankind in the New Aeon of which I have proclaimedthe Word. I now return to the contemplation of my personal relation with mine Angel.It was not a ‘vision of mankind in the New Aeon’ but, as we said before, anadumbration of the Grade of Hermit, and how it influences (in the subtle planes) thelife of mankind (the folk athirst) as a whole. If it were a vision of mankind, ‘couple bytwo and by two’ would be a rather limiting concept. Look at the multiplicity of thedance of the stars: many go alone, many by twos, amny by threes, fours, fives...many by thousands, many by millions. The only thing they all have in common is thatthey all go.It should be noted that the conversation of the Angel is suggested to be moreimportant than the knowledge. The Conversation is that effect of resonance of whichwe have already spoken. There is an old Portuguese saying, “Tell me who you goaround with, and I’ll tell you who you are.” It probably has its equivalent in alllanguages.42. O Holy Exalted One, O Self beyond self. O Self­Luminous Image of theUnimaginable Naught, O my darling, my beautiful, come Thou forth and followme.I repeat the Invocation. He is the Image of Nuit. The propriety of these phrasesbecomes manifest on studying the account already given of this nature.43. Adonai, divine Adonai, let Adonai initiate refulgent dalliance! Thus Iconcealed the name of Her name that inspireth my rapture, the scent of whosebody bewildereth the soul, the light of whose soul abaseth this body unto thebeasts.The first sentence is an acrostic of ‘Ada Laird’. This was one of the girls withwhom I was intimate at the time of writing this Book. In these verses I deliberatelyidentify my sexual exhilaration with my spiritual ecstasy, thus finally denying any"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"difference between any two parts of my conscious being.This is easier said than done. The numeration of ‘Ada Laird’ contains a furthermystery. It is becoming easier in our days for people to conceive that the sex act canbe a form of prayer, thanks to the Influence of the Beast. Of course, it is the mostefficient form of prayer, since the sexual energy is the only function in normalmankind that is connected with all planes in which a human being exists. It is a formof samadhi that even the man (or the woman) in the street can cultivate, and it maylead to the highest attainments if only the fools persist in their folly long enough.However, they often get rather afraid. Cf. V. 62.44. I have sucked out the blood with my lips; I have drained Her beauty of itssustenance; I have abased Her before me, I have mastered Her, I have possessedHer, and Her life is within me. In Her blood I inscribe the secret riddles of theSphinx of the Gods, that none shall understand, save only the pure andvoluptuous, the chaste and obscene, the androgyne and the gynander that havepassed beyond the bars of the prison that the old Slime of Khem set up in theGates of Amennti.This constitutes a profound Riddle of Holiness. (Note in Greek, ‘the Sphinx’ or‘the Strangler” equals 781 = 71 x 11.) (Note H Σφιγξ ­ Γρακος) The Greek work forUraeus also equals 781. See authorities for special meanings of these words.Those only understand it who combine in themselves the extremes of Moral idea,identifying them through transcendental overcoming of the antinomy. They musthave gone further yet, beyond the fundamental opposition of the sexes. The malemust have completed himself and become androgyne; the female, and becomegynander.This does not refer necessarily to homosexual intercourse; it refers to thepolarization of the Sheaths. A person could be androgyne or gynander withoutshowing homosexual behavior on the physical plane. On the other hand, there is noreason why they shouldn’t, if so inclined, go to bed with people involved. The key,however, consists in that they wouldn’t go to bed only with people of their own sex, ifthey did. Otherwise they would be homosexual, not androgyne or gynander.This incompleteness imprisons the soul. To think “I am not woman, but man” orvice versa, is to limit one’s self, to set a bar to one’s motion. It is the root of the‘shutting­up’ which culminates in become “Mary inviolate” or a “Black Brother.”It must be always remembered, however, that the planes cannot be mixed. You arelimited by the parameters of your physical incarnation in one type of body oranother, at least at the present stage of scientific knowledge. Those people whodeliberately change their sexual characteristics by surgical means may be simplygiving in to the social pressure of disapproval of their ‘irregular’ behavior. They arelike blacks (so­called) crossing “the color line”. This is no solution, but cowardlyevasion. The idea is to do away with the color line, and with sexual prejudice of anysort. Do not change yourself­change society. You are not a function of the majority.Fuck the majority. Society as a whole­“all”­is a function of you.

Note that this is not ‘evil’, but merely thestoppage of the Energy of the Universe. The ‘contending forces’ of Good and Evilare complementary, and to be united by “love under will” — as I too often do,loosely and clumsily, thanks to my education and the limitations of language — tomean “that which is against my True Will,” the implication is not of anything active,however, loathsome or terrible it might appear. Any such idea is to be assimilated by“love under will” with its contradictory, thus reaching, in ecstacy, to a newConception transcending the plane of these opposites.Actually, nothing is against your True Will. Cf. Cap. IV, v. 46. It must beassimilated by the Formula of Nuit: 2=0. Your “enemy” is but a beacon of yourRoyal Road. But do not mix the planes!Thus, my chief obstacle is the belief that any active Idea soever is ‘evil’ and it istherefore the main tenet of the Slave Gods, ‘Original Sin’, the existence of a Personal‘Devil’ opposed to an Almighty Goodness — Ahrimanes and Aormuzdi as above —which threatens my Will.The expression ‘Slave Gods’ means the gods worhipped by slaves (in the sense ofLiber AL). These must always be “black brethren”­not lords of the earth, but lords ofits slums.Amennti — the West — the Place of Death — is the quarter attributed to Osiris inhis aspect as the Slain God, that is, in modern slang, to ‘Jesus’. To us “The word ofSin is restriction.” The only possibility of ‘evil’ is that the Will may be hampered. Onthe contrary, to the slaves of ‘Jesus’, there is scarce an act which is not of the natureof ‘sin’. Even our “righteousness is as filthy rags.” “There is none good, no, not one,”etc., etc., ad nauseam — et praetor! To us, then, ‘Jesus’ is the very fount and origin ofall possible ‘evil’, for he synonymous with the idea of Restriction on every plane. TheChristian conception of sin as the will of the natural man, the ‘Old Adam’, is the basisof all internal conflict — of moral insanity. It is true that some writers callingthemselves Christian have declared for Antinomianism; but orthodoxy has alwayscondemned these; it is evident that these doctrines imply Pantheism. The sophisms ofPaul demonstrate clearly enough how deeply false to one’s self one must be, even tomake the essay to disengage the mind from the dilemma implicit in the theses that‘Salvation’ emancipates from ‘Sin’, and that the ‘Saint’ is morally bound by the ‘lawsof God’. The passages here following would be laughable had not Historystigmatized them as atrocious.That is, the passages following those, in the “Epistels”, where Paul gives theexample to Aquinas. The many abuses of the Christist chruches against mankindwere based on these sophisms. Of course, any people always have the governmentthey deserve, or the God they deserve.

I am to “invoke often,” not to criticize.}. By July 6, Crowley had semminglyaccepted his role, writing “Unto thee Adonai do I commit my way. Unto thee theAugoeides, unto thee the Self­glittering one.

But unless the disciple is so truly promising that the Order decides tospend the necessary magick energy to discipline him, he must discipline himself. Andthe temptation to ‘go one better than the Instructor’ is almost irresistible, particularlybecause the Instructgor is so meek, so mild, so accomodating, seems so fearful anduncertain of himself! (Cf. Tao Teh King, Cap. XV.)Yet to disobey your Instructor is deadly from a spritiual point of view. You cut thelink with Authority, for the Instructor is the representative of the Lord of the Aeon,and you become the plaything of forces beyond the control of mortal man. Youi maybeocme rich (usually in the way of a thief) or famous (usually in a way that the Orderwould consider infamous); but your Work, to which you had obligated yourself whenyou signed the Oath, is abandoned, and by that much mankind, who needed yourliberation to increase its own, is diminished.

Here is the quote from ‘Hagiography’ This is a unpublishedpassage that was not included in the Crowley ­ Motta Commentaries of LXV. It is sointeresting and informative that I've included it.).Meredith Starr, whose real name was Herbert Close, was a typical mattoid. Thereare two calsses of disciples who turn one’s hair prematurely white. There is the stolidclass who find it very difficult to make out what I mean, and who are resistant to thepractices. I do not mind taking trouble with such people, despite the patiencerequired, for when they at last succeed in getting results, it is sure to be somethingworth having, and one can rely on its genuineness. Their difficulty comes from thebest qualities of their minds: scepticism and common sense. The other class has nobrains at all. It lives by the breath of its vanity. These people attain more sublimemystic success in an hour than the greatest men in history have ever managed in aquarter of a century. Meredith Starr was an extreme case.One of his delusions was that he was a great poet. I was at first surprised when hecame along with a poem so clearly imitated from the last that I happened to havewritten that it seemed more like an inaccurate copy than anything else. When this waspointed out, he claimed vehemently and quite seriously that it was an independentinspiration. One could not convince him about even the most glaring cases.In one sense, the inspiration was, now and again, quite original. When I broughtout ‘Amphora’ [Crowley’s volume of devotional verse to the Virgin Mary (1909),later republished as ‘Hail Mary!’ (1912)], the Spirit, by a strange coincidence, movedhim also to write hymns to the Blessed Virgin. He may have thought that he ought togo one better by introducing learned allusions. He produced one couplet, which Iregard as more worthy of immortality than anything else he wrote. It ran:In Khem of old thou wast a cow;Thou art the Virgin Mary now."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"I had very little experience of disciples in those days, and simply could notunderstand people claiming success in such subtle and difficult matters withouthaving applied every possible sceptical safeguard. For the first few days, I wasactually fooled into believing that Starr had really attained the success he claimed. Butwhen I found that he completely forgot his successes 24 hours later, I saw that theremust be womething wrong, and it did not take me long to understand that his infantilevanity simply took every wish­phantasm for absolute truth. It was simply impossibleto keep track of the miraculaous powers which he possessed. It was also impossibleto shake his belief in the powers of his purusa on its at home day.However, as luck was with me, he turned up one afternoon and informed me thathe had just acquired the power of taking any poison without affecting him. Isuggested that I try him out, and he was besotted enough to receive the suggestionjoyfully. “Ring up Whineray” [E.P. Whineray, Corwley’s favorite pharmacist and theauthor of ‘A Pharmaceutical Study of Cannabis Sativa,” The Equinox Vol. I, No. 1 Isaid to Neuburg, (1909).],I said to Neuburg [Victor Benjamin Neuburg (1883­1940),poet, coeditor of ‘The Equinox’, and early A∴A∴ member.], with the aplomb and‘savior faire’ peculiar to the English race, “and tell him to send a boy down at oncewith ¼ ouce of Strychnine.” Neuburg went to the telephone­and a faint gleam ofcommon sense flashed across Starr’s mind. He asked me if I could not think ofsomething that would be less devastating in its effect in case he had not got the powerquite perfect yet. I said yes, I could accommodate him, and fetched 10 grains ofCalomel [A laxative.] from my medicine case. He placed the tablets in his open lefthand and picked them up one by one and swallowed them, on each occasion grindingout between his teeth, with the most horrific groans­which he intended to representthe power of will­“Strength beyond Strength, Pow­wer beyond Pow­wer, Adonai!”.We then proceded to talk about other matters. An hour or so later, he said he wouldgo home, having demonstrated his power over Calomel. I suggestd that perhapssomething might happen later on. But he laughed the idea to scorn. He promised,however, to let us know if anything happened after all.About 11 o’clock that night, the telephone rang. It was Meredith Starr to explainthat the incident in his career which had recently embellished it was due to the normaloperation of nature and not in any way the Calomel. When we had masted ourselvessufficiently to reply, we congratulated him on the efficiency of his alimentaryarrangements and hoped to hear form him shortly. We stopped counting after a time,but the telephone calls became constantly more frequent and urgent, and hisexplanation of the facts progressively more ingenious, though sometimes a littledifficult to follow or even to catch, perhaps because, he being destined to attain themastery of the fourth power of the Sphinx, or for some other reason which I will notventure to suggest, his voice had become strangely weak.As I said above, this is an extraordinary case. But the general type constitutes, as amoderate estimate, at least 70% of so­called occult students. Even quie seriousaspirants fall into the trap before they are any good. I have to drill them in scepticismand the scientific method of verifying one’s results for months on end."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"My honesty in this matter, I firmly believe, the main reason for my unpopularity asa teacher. I refuse to flatter people’s vanity. I may as well say that I doubt whethereven the best minds can be trusted on this point, unless they have been previouslytrained pretty thoroughly in some physical science. Few people have any idea of whatis meant by “possible sources of error”, even when they asre anxious to maintain anagnostic attitude.Descartes said that there must be a moment in the life of every teacher when heresolved to stand outside all his preconceived ideas, withyout exception, no matterhow apodeictically certain teny appear. I entirely agree. Let me add that I attach novalue to any experiment of any sort unless it is not only checked and verified in everypossible way, but is itself the logical result of previous work. I believe it is quiteuseless to go out for a casual stroll, so to speak, on the Astral Plane, or even into highspiritual states. The disconnectedness of the experience constitutes a liability todelusions. It should be obvious from the fact that ‘amasati’ is the effective test ofspiritual progress, that any expiriment which is outside the true path of the individualis not in the least likely to mean anything to him. All magical work ought to be rigidlysystematic.It may be objected to, that in my own case, the most important events in mymagickal career came entirely unsought and indeed altogether against my will. Butthe exception is only apparent. Inded my failure to understand itas the necessaryclimax of my previous work threw my career into absolute confusion iuntil I hadsucceeded in reconciling the seeming opposites. But, of course, it was not merely myown karma but that of the planet that was involved. Unknown to myself,I hadbrought myself to a state which made me useful to the chiefs of the Order in a waywhich I had not contemplated, even though I had formally requested to be employedon such a business. In any case, the character of the exception is such that nothing ofthe sort is likely to arise again for some hundreds of years, so that the general rulehere laid down may very well be taken as absolute.Later developments of this remarkable youth were interesting. People began tonotice something, don’t you know, and acted accordingly on certain occasions. But inone interval, he beat it over to Steiner [Dr. rudolf Steiner (1861­1925] was a prolificauthor and founder of the Anthroposophical Society.

But Starr was not content tobe with a mere disciple of Jesus. Nothing would do for him but the Master himself.He discovered this amiable Semite somewhere in India [Meher Baba (1894­1969)].He had given up carpentering and set up as a school master, and was very anxious toget English and American parents to send their boys to him for training.

Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. who instead of plodding steadily through theappointed Task of a Zelator, took advantage of a subtle Regulation of the A∴A∴which permits any man, whatever his grade, to declare himself a Master of theTemple, and by mere virtue of the Oath, to become one [Charles Stansfeild Jones(Frater Achad or Frater O.I.V.V.I.O.), “Liber CLXV, A Master of the Temple,” partI, ‘The Equinox III(I) (1919 e.v.).

In this case the intense purity of the aspirationof our Brother, and the Magical Necessity — in a matter not directly connected withhis personal career in the Order — that he should take this appalling step, with hiseyes open to the responsibility and danger involved, saved him from theconsequences which would have smashed any arrogant, insolent, or presumptuouspretender. Nevertheless, his ignorance of the details of the intermediate Grades, ledhim constantly into the most deplorable errors, from the devastating penalties ofwhich he was saved by the loving vigilance of his Superior in the Order, at leastinsofar as the more critical catastrophes were concerned[This was written in 1923 e.v.

The foundationsof the pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset; did the king weep atdawn that the crown of the pyramid was yet unquarried in the distant land?There is yet a third consideration to be made in connection with this doctrine ofThe Next Step. It does in fact seem far easier to wander in the Wonderland of theSupernal Triad than to dig one’s way painfully through the Path of Tau, to make theRenunciation of a Dhamma­Buddha than to acquire Asana by dint of Anguishedapplication and acutest agony of that detested and despised physical phantom, thevery soul of Distraction, Dispersion, Degradation, Distress, and Despair!But this is a ‘damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion’ arising from the simplefact that nobody can possibly form any idea soever of the Nature of the Task of anygrade beyond his own — and I say this with every emphasis, despite by devotion anddetermination to describe the details of the Path of the Wise — even being at thepains of inventing what is practically a new language for this very purpose.True, I have succeded thus far, that the Initiate, on arriving at any given Grade,instantly recognizes the accuracy of my account, thus confirming his confidence in"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"my knowledge of the matter, and his assurance that he has really attained thereto andis not being fooled by his own vanity. But, until he has actual experience of this partof the Faith, he is bound to misunderstand my plainest presentation of its most evidentsymptoms.Unless the Aspirant fully comprehend and freely acquiesce in this inherentincapacity, he is only too likely to try to sneak through the dim dreary dreadfuldiscipline of his Grade — the more loathsome precisely because it represents hisactual limitation of the moment, and have a perfectly lovely time fancying himself anExempt Adept or an Arahat or even — I have known one such unhappy expert inself­delusion — an Ipsissimus! It was nothing to the great Him that the only referenceto that Grade in all our Holy Books is to indicate a certain practice (itself beyondcomprehension of any but the mightiest­minded Masters of the Temple!) as “theopening of the Grade.”The Parable of the Pyramid requires no commentary: it is as lucid as it is sublime.The whole passage (vv. 48­51) may be summed as an appeal to ordinary GoodSense — called “Common Sense” (Lucus a non lucendo) as being the rarest ofHuman qualities. Yet the truth lies deeper than this cynical apothegm.Good sense is in reality common to all men: it is the property of the Unconsciouswhose Omniscience matches its Omnipotence. The trouble is that in practically everyparticular case the Intellect insists on interfering: Vanity craves to be flattered by‘improving’ what is by nature perfect ­with uniformly disastrous results. This is oneof the main interpretations of the repeated diatribes in The Book of the Law against“the Reason,” against “because and his kin” (CCXX, ii, 27­33, etc.) or any similarusurpation of the royalty of the Individual by his own self­created illusions. Theintellect should be a machine whereby one can express the facts of Nature. But itcannot even interpret them; that is the function of Neschamah. Even its critical facultyis limited to the object of seeming internal coherence, of avoiding any appearance ofconflict. When it arrogates to itself any further function it is ultra crepidam [Lat., lit.“Above the foundation,” a paraphrase of ‘ne sutor supra crepidam judicaret’, “Let notthe shoemaker criticize beyond his last”; the meaning here is “beyond itscompetence.”].Note the word But in CCXX, ii, 34, marking the antithesis of the right course ofaction (vv. 34­51) against the wrong (vv. 27­33).52. There was also an humming­bird that spake unto the horned cerastes, andprayed him for poison. And the great snake of Khem the Holy One, the royalUraeus serpent, answered him and said:52­56. The Parable of the Ibis, the Humming­Bird, and Uraeus Serpent.Any comment would be impertinent: the signification of the Parable, deep thoughit be, is lucid as any passage in literature; and the language, exquisitely ornate as itis, a sublimity and a simplicity all its own.The moral value, in particular, challenges that of the boasted parables of the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Gospels.

Live thou and thy children as I and my fathers have lived, even unto anhundred millions of generations, and it may be that the mercy of the MightyOnes may bestow upon thy children a drop of the poison of eld.This last sentence intimates a very important fact about Initiation: it can produce agenetic change, that is, a modification in the DNA code. We must remark, inaddition, that this modification is not necessarily transmited through the normalgenerative process. It is primarily an effect of telekinetics. This is the scientific factbehind the universal legends about “virgin births”. It will perhaps be ascertained byso­called orthodox science within the next few hundred years. We leave this statementas a suggestion for research by parapsychologists, knowing they will need very fullcooperation from many other branches of science, especially themore exact ones,before they determine, not theprocess, but its manifestations. In this way­only­Lysenko was right.54. Then the humming­bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew unto theflowers, and it was as if naught had been spoken between them. Yet in a littlewhile a serpent struck him that he died.55. But an Ibis that meditated upon the bank of Nile the beautiful god listenedand heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways, and became as a serpent, sayingPeradventure in an hundred millions of millions of generations of my children,they shall attain to a drop of the poison of the fang of the Exalted One.56. And behold! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Uraeus serpent, andthe poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and forever.The attitude of the Ibis could be defined as ‘pure will without lust of result’. ‘Themoon waxed thrice’: three lunar months, or a station of the sun, is the minimum timenecessary to establish a new psychosomatic rhythm, if it is volitive.57.

The final passage summarizes the whole Book. It demands intimate studyand adroit handling on the part of the Commentator; for each verse, while complete initself, is an integral and necessary element of the whole.58. “I”: the Scribe: Cf. Verse 48.The significance of the number LXV has been explained in the prefatory note. Themetaphors in this text are peculiar. One is of gold — fine gold — beaten with finegold to form a circlet to adorn a bride and queen. The reference is to the Adept in thisrelation with Adonai.The metaphor of the stones is, on the other hand, of Tiphereth. (The text assumesthat the Great Pyramid of Gizeh as in fact designed as a Temple of Initiation whereinright fitly he celebrated the Ritual of the Slain God). For the whole symbolism of thestone, see the Qabalah, the rituals of Freemasonry, etc.Here A.C. apparently confused Gizeh the city with Kheops the king, unless it wasthe copyist’s mistake. We remind the reader that this commentary was originallydictated to Frater O.P.V..Note that words and deeds, being rightly wrought into one, lose their grossness andbecome pure thought.

And they that read the book and debated thereon passed into thedesolate land of Barren Words. And they that sealed up the book into theirblood were the chosen of Adonai, and the Thought of Adonai was a Word anda Deed; and they abode in the Land that the far­off travellers call Naught.Intellectual criticism of this Book leads to barren controversy — the wilderness ofpedantry. It must be appreciated as a poem (sealed up into the blood) taken as thenourishment of the inmost life itself. Those who do this become chosen candidates forthe K. and C. of the H.G.A. Their Aspiration (Thought) is then crystallized intoWord and Deed: they accomplish the Operation of the Sacred Magick.The “Land:” the reference is to Nuit.

This doctrine is the most deadly poison for the unworthy (even the ChristianMystics gathered some faint idea of this “eating and drinking damnation untothemselves”Unhappily, they stopped there. ‘Smitten of disease’: the tribulation of ordeal,which is bliss. ‘The abomination’: the Law of Θελημα, or 666, or Heru­ra­haHimself. ‘Thick black smoke of the evil abode’: the Light of the so­called‘Rosicrucians’. Hell, the core of the star. Of coruse, all this is very disagreeable atfirst. Most fools do not persist in their folly, consequently.It is strange that the text refrains from specifying the nature of the error: apparentlythe only point at issue is whether one is or is not “chosen.” (v. 63).Note the word “weary,” and the symbols of stagnation and passivity (a) hath holdupon them, (b) thick, (c) black, (d) smoke, (e) abode. Contrast with these the stigmataof Attainment in v. 64 all fiery, active, and eager, even in the sphere ordinarilyassociated with the idea of repose — “eventide.” The Crown of the Sun himself istheir girdle (Cf. the Rosicrucian adjuration “Be thy mind open, etc.)­ —the girdle ofthe “death­kisses” this identifying death with love, the creative energy.The mystery becomes clear on reference to verse 59. To be “chosen” is a matter forone’s own Will to decide. If this Book be alien to the student, it will poison himthrough and through; he must “seal” it up into his blood; then, drinking of it as aWine which is identical with his life itself, it intoxicates them to the realization ofthemselves as the Lord Adonai, the Soul of the Book itself.This student remembers that the Book did not poison him at the time of reading"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"and learning by heart; on the contrary, it led him to the Neophyte Initiation. But hehath quaffed many a poinsoned cup since, and suffered the torment, and felt thepresence of the evil one. Cf. VII III.40­48. And Cf. LXV IV.46. My Lord, I love Thee!63. But the chosen ones drank thereof, and became even as my Lord, mybeautiful, my desirable one. There is no wine like unto this wine.‘Became even as my Lord’: see The Wake World.64. They are gathered together into a glowing heart, as Ra that gathereth hisclouds about Him at eventide into a molten sea of Joy; and the snake that is thecrown of Ra bindeth them about with the golden girdle of the death­kisses.‘Joy’: 26=2x13. (But also 2+6=8.)65. So also is the end of the book, and the Lord Adonai is about it on all sideslike a Thunderbolt, and a Pylon, and a Snake, and a Phallus, and in the midstthereof he is like the Woman that jetteth out the milk of the stars from her paps;yea, the milk of the stars from her paps.Cf. v. 14: meditate strictly upon the propriety of the first appearance of thisparticular symbol in just this place.The symbol is now completed by the introduction of Nuit into its midst. Comparethe similar appearance of Shin in IHVH. (If this is not explained, do so fully).Shin, the Holy Ghost, by descending in the midst of the Tetragram of the BlindForces, transforms the Cross of the Elements into the Pentagram, Symbol of Man,IHShVH, ‘Jeheshua’. Sh is, of course, the Element of Spirit. The letter has to dodouble work in the Hebrew Alphabet, which is perhaps why the Jews keep confusingSpirit with Fire to this day.What letter, then significant of Nuit, will transmute אדני as Shin does יהוה?The usual letter is He, “The Star,” Atu XVII, ♒ (Note that by the precession of theEquinoxes the sun is now in Aquarius instead of Pisces at the Vernal Equinox. In theAeon of the Dying God men worshipped ♍ and ♓, the Virgin and the Fish. Wereplace this by ♒, Nuit and ♌, Babalon and the Beast conjoined. But as צ is ‘notthe Star’, and ♈ swing around ♓ as ♌ and ♎ about ♏: Atus VIII and XIinterchanged, and so Atus XVII and IV. But the Actual God worshipped hasprogressed from ♉ the laborious slain Bull of Mithras, ☉ in the North, to ♊ theChildren (R.H.K. and H.P.K.). We thus obtain a Pentagrammaton אדהני whosevalue is 70, ץ, the Eye, Set or Saturn, Atu XV “The Devil.”"}]
