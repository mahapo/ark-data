[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" I1 Liber Gon Theurgia Goetia Summa Congressus Cum Daemone Sub Figura DCCCLXXXVIII2 Being the Ritual employed by Centaurus as an initial formulation of his Holy Guardian Angel during his Practicus period. Prepared An C in  R in  by Frater Centaurus 3º=8▫ Revised by Frater Apollonius 4º=7▫ “The Practicus should revise this Ritual throughout in the Light of his personal researches in the Qabalah, and thus make it his own peculiar property.” –Book Four, Appendix IV, pg. 522   1 The Enochian letter Gon (also the letter of the Filius Lucii Angel associated with Sol; Semeliel) is equivalent to the English letter I and the Hebrew Yod. In Enochian and Hebrew, it has a value of ten, while in the English Qabalah (cf. Liber 805), it has a value of nine, suggesting the ̳foundation‘ of the Ruach; consistent with the fact that this ritual has much to do with the Body of Light. Ten plus nine is nineteen; the number of the Sun Atu. The ̳Letter Essence‘ of Gon presents the root energy of enablement and signifies an increasing rate of growth. This is consistent with the final proclamations of the Aspirant at the end of the invocations (Cf. etymological interpolation of GAIA in Section G). And as GAIA is also the Earth, we can infer Malkuth, the tenth Sephira, consistent with the Hebrew and Enochian value for Gon. 2 800 (DCCC) is the sub-figure for the Master Therion‘s Liber Sameck and is of course, 8 times 100 with 8 referring to Hod and I would surmise the 100 reflecting Liber C. In my personal rendering, the sub-figure is 888, pertaining specifically to Hod."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"―Liber Sameck becomes a key ritual for this Grade. The ritual and its scholion should be carefully studied and then rewritten in light of the Practicus‘ personal researches in the Qabalah. Note the word SABAO (SABAO/SABAF) in the text. This is a variant of IAO and equals 70; the number of the Devil Atu. Study this carefully. Additionally, SABAO is to be replaced with ZBAV (TzBA—F), of which the root has the value of 93 and the final Vau3 has a value of 6. There is an alternative spelling TzBA-F Where the Root, (ABz) \"an Host\", has the value of 93. The Practicus should revive this Ritual throughout in the Light of his personal researches in the Qabalah, and thus make it his own peculiar property. The spelling here suggested implies that he who utters the Word affirms his allegiance to the symbols 93 and 6 that he is a warrior in the army of Will and of the Sun. 93 is also the number of AIWAZ and 6 of The Beast.‖ Consider the following verse from Liber AL vel Legis in light of the phonetic similarity that TzBAF with the word, Kaaba. As you were informed in your Zelator Grade papers: In the Wake World, Lola asks her Fairy Prince when in Yesod: ―Shall we be married in this House?‖ and the Fairy Prince responds: ―No, this is only the House where the business is carried on.‖ AL III.41: \"Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house: all must be done well and with business way.\" Draw correspondences between these two words in an essay that explains the changes brought to Liber Sameck as directed above. Additionally, consider the following (below) in that same essay to be entitled: [Motto]‘s Journey with the Sun. AL I.60: \"My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.\" 60. Nuit: Her symbolic Figure. Nuit declares her Nature in a Riddle of Number and Colour and Form: this also is elsewhere explained being a matter of Magick and Wisdom proper to vowed Students rather than to the profane. THE OLD COMMENT Nu = 56 and 5 + 6 = 11. The Circle in the Pentagram? See Liber NV. The uninitiated perceive only darkness in Night; the wise perceive the golden stars in the vault of azure. Concerning that Secret Glory it is not here fitting to discourse. THE NEW COMMENT The general significance of the number 11 is Magick, particularly that form of it which is Love under Will; for it unites the 5 and the 6. Thus Abrahadabra has 11 letters; and 418 = 11 x 38. This number must be thoroughly studied by the Qabalah. See Appendix {NOTE: Appendix not yet recovered.} In the original MSS. the second paragraph begins \"The shape of my star is\" -- and then breaks off -- the Scribe was unable to hear what was being said. This was presumably because his mind was so full of preconceived ideas about the different kinds of stars appropriate to various ideas. An alternate phrase was subsequently dictated to the Scarlet Woman, and inserted in the manuscript by her own hand. This star is the pentagram, with the single point at the top. The points touch the parts of Nuith's body as shown in the Stele. The earth-point marks the position of her feet, the fire-point, that of her hands, the other three points -- air, spirit, and water respectively -- refer to \"my secret centre, my heart, and my tongue.\" See Liber NV for all this. “...who are of us.” US=6+60=66. “Who are of the Sun and use the Positive Current of Force.” (6x11=66).   3 Cf. Scholion to Liber Reguli"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Also, 66=12, which is a number of the Zodiac.4 US, therefore, indicates “those who belong to the Sun, who use the Force of AUD, and who are of the Woman “that jetteth out the milk of the stars from her paps’”—the Milky Way, our particular Galaxy5. The Law “is for all”, but Thelemites are defined as those who fulfill the above conditions. You must make no mistake. There are people who are of the Sun, but use the Force of AUB; they are not Thelemites. There are people who use the Force of AUD, but are not of the Sun, nor of any other star of our Galaxy—they are guests in our system, so to speak. They, also, are not Thelemites. It is with those two cases that a mistake is most likely, since there are some points of sympathy, or rather, empathy; “thou hast no right but to do thy will.” This note is for member of the Grades of Practicus, Philosophus, and Dominus Liminis. But the Zelator will be wise if he tries to fathom it, since he “begins to study the formula of the Rosy Cross.” Note: Some of the Master Therion’s original commentary is included in this text. However, much of it has been edited by Centaurus in accordance with his own approach to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.   4 The importance of this is gleaned through an understanding of the Starry Gnosis. 5 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"POINT I Evangelii Textus Redactus THE INVOCATION Re-paraphrased And translated into Enochian In accord6 with the Gematric value of the BARBAROUS NAMES Transliterated to their Hebrew valuations with considerations of the Etymological significance of their English derivations7 Section A Let the Philosophus be standing in this circle on the square of Tiphereth, armed with his Wand and Cup; but let him perform the Ritual throughout in his Body of Light. He may burn the Cakes of Light, or the Incense of Abramelin; he may be prepared by Liber CLXXV, the reading of Liber LXV, and by the practices of Yoga. He may invoke Hadit by \"... wine and strange drugs\" if he so will.8 He prepares the circle by the usual formulae of Banishing and Consecration, etc. He recites Section A as a rehearsal before His Holy Guardian Angel of the attributes of that Angel. Each phrase must be realized with full concentration of force, so as to make Samadhi as perfectly as possible upon the truth proclaimed. The Oath 1. Thee I invoke, the Bornless One. He identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, and the Kether thereof; one formulation of Hadit in the boundless Body of Nuith. 2. Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens. 3. Thee, that didst create the Night and the Day. 4. Thee, that didst create the darkness and the Light. He asserts that His Angel has created (for the purpose of self-realization through projection in conditioned Form) three pairs of opposites: (a) The Fixed and the Volatile; (b) The Unmanifested and the Manifest; and (c) the Unmoved and the Moved. Otherwise, the Negative and the Positive in respect of Matter, Mind and Motion.   6 By AIQ BKR, the Enochian phrases are equal to the gematric value of the barbarous words in their Hebrew transliterations. 7 For the most part, I have tried to use the etymological derivations of the Greek and the French, which derives from the Greek. There are some exceptions. 8 Any such formula should be used only when the adept has full knowledge based on experience of the management of such matters."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5. Thou art OL ON DE IAIADIX OL ON DE IAIADIX (\"Myself made to Honor\"9): Whom no man hath seen at any time. He acclaims his Angel as brought to honor (the full consciousness that is the success of the Adept); adding that this Individuality is divine in nature (AIAD is the root of the word for God). The numeration of the phrase reduces to ten; suggesting Atu X (Fortune), ruled by Jupiter.10 The idea is then of royalty; the kingship that a Thelemite must assume and possess. Jupiter also rules Sagittarius (the present Manifestation of time), which points directly to Tiphareth (the sixth Sephira; the Sun) and suggests the Ethical Triad. 6. Thou art IABES G TOFGLO IABES G TOFGLO (\"the Supreme Life11 in All things\"). He hails Him as IABES G TOFGLO, the great Alchemical secret that causes the Alchemist to seek the perfection of matter. Such ―Truth‖12 inherent in matter brought to its most regal manifestation alludes again, to Jupiter. Here, we have the fourth Sephirah within the Ethical Triad. Note here also, that the numeration comes to seven hundred, suggesting Venus; who as Isis, brings us to the Chemical Wedding13 that unites the macrocosm with the microcosm. 7. Thou art A VOOAN NUAM A VOOAN NUAM (\"the Truth Continuance14\"). He hails Him as A VOOAN15 NUAM, the idea of continuance clearly suggests time or this Manifestation of Sagittarius; whose nature is Truth. The entire phrase numerates by AIQ BKR to five; giving us the fifth Sephira and completing our survey of the Ethical Triad. In the Pythagorean analysis of the Tree-of-Life, time is associated with Geburah. 8. Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust. He acclaims His Angel as having \"eaten of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil\"; otherwise, having become wise (in the Dyad, Chokmah) to apprehend the formula of Equilibrium which is now His own, being able to apply Himself accurately to His self-appointed environment. 9. Thou didst make the Female and the Male. He acclaims His Angel as having laid down the Law of Love as the Magical formula of the Universe, that He may resolve the phenomenal again into its noumenal phase by uniting any two opposites in ecstatic passion. 10. Thou didst produce the Seeds and the Fruit. He acclaims His Angel as having appointed that this formula of Love should effect not only the dissolution of the separateness of the Lovers into His own impersonal Godhead, but their co-ordination in a \"Child\" quintessentialized   9 The formal title of Philosophus is: Honored Frater and this will be performed at that Grade. 10 Jupiter is the second Sun as per the Starry Gnosis; Cf. Gnostic Cycles. 11 Hadit; the conception of the Khabs as that unchangeable source of life in all beings; the spark of Universal Consciousness. The angel is conceived of this substance and its dual relation between that Universal Consciousness and the mind of the Higher Self. The essence of self that is ultimately squeezed out the Sahasrara Chakra at the climax of this rite; the secreted seed of self that the Angel feeds on, by which it fuses itself to the Khu of the Aspirant. 12 The original paraphrase in Liber Samekh is: ―the Truth in Matter.‖ 13 Cf. the Rosicrucian document: The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz. 14 The Everlasting Truth; Dharma; both Universal and Individual and so of a dual-nature. 15 This is the pronunciation of the Enochian word for Truth, used by the ̳fallen angels,‘ which is a clear suggestion of the Nephilim. Cf. my article: Reign of the Demiurge."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"from its parents to constitute a higher order of Being than theirs, so that each generation is an alchemical progress towards perfection in the direction of successive complexities. As Line 9 asserts Involution, Line 10 asserts Evolution. 11. Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another. He acclaims His Angel as having devised this method of self-realization; the object of Incarnation is to obtain its reactions to its relations with other incarnated Beings and to observe theirs with each other. Section Aa. 1. I am APOLLONIUS, thy servant, unto whom thou dost commit thy Word and who prophecies16 in thy Name. The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious communication with His Angel, channeling his voice so that it seems as if prophecy to the scribe. This is an important point for the Practicus, traveling on the path of Peh, which is the mouth; the oracle. 2. Thou didst produce the moist and the dry, and that which nourisheth all created Life. Elpizo17 is the Word I have fashioned for Thee as thou art the object of my faith. The Adept reminds his Angel that He has created That One Substance of which Hermes hath written in the Emerald Tablet, whose virtue is to unite in itself all opposite modes of Being, including the microcosm and the macrocosm and thereby to serve as a Talisman charged with the Spiritual Energy of Existence, an Elixir or Stone composed of the physical basis of Life. The word inscribed on the Zelator‘s Knife is presented as the utterance of the Angel and the number on the Cup is used talismanically to draw the Angel, who is the Aspirant‘s whole Universe. This Commemoration is placed between the two personal appeals to the Angel, as if to claim privilege to partake of this Eucharist which createth, sustaineth and redeemeth all things. 3. Hear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of Ra-Hoor-Khuit: this is Thy True Name,18 handed down by Aiwass and through his scribe19 Ankh-af-na-Khonsu. He now asserts that he is himself the \"Angel\" or messenger of his Angel; that is, that he is a mind and body whose office is to receive and transmit the Word of his Angel. He hails his Angel as a Sun (Ra-Hoor-Khuit), presented by the Secret Chiefs of whom Aiwass is a representative. Other such representatives may be of the Nephilim, to include Bartzabel, Amalantra, Lam, Abuldiz, etc.   16 He who speaks forth the Word of the Angel. 17 Elpizw is the Greek word, which means ̳to hope for‘ or ̳to expect.‘ It alludes to the power of faith, which itself is an expectation; being open to that which we hope to receive. It‘s value is 932, which in the Hebrew Qabalah is the value of the Hebrew phrase ̳The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.‘ 932 is also the value of Frater Apollonius‘ motto as Zelator: Zephyros. Elpizw is the Word to ̳represent the Universe‘ and that was carved into the Knife of the Zelator. This word represents the Universe in relation to the Angel; it is the whole comprehension that the Aspirant can hold in his being. So its influx breaks up the lower vehicle; a catastrophe to the psyche that precedes the emergent Alchemical integration; Solve et Coagula. In Enochian, ILPIZ means: ―He whose place is in the Aethyrs.‖ 18 True in that it belongs to the Collective Consciousness of our race. 19 Apollonius is the scribe for his as yet, un-named Angel as Ankh-af-na-Khonsu was the scribe for Aiwass. The purpose of the ritual is to cry for an ̳apocalyptic‘ epiphany as comes with the vision of the Angel. This is the shamanistic ̳crying for a vision.‘"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Section B. The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the sections now following B to Gg. He is to travel astrally around the circle, making the appropriate pentagrams, sigils, and signs. His direction is widdershins. He thus makes three curves, each covering three-fourths of the circle. He should give the sign of the Enterer on passing the Kiblah, or Direction of Boleskine. This picks up the force naturally radiating from that point and projects it in the direction of the path of the Magician. The sigils are those given in the Equinox Vol. I, No. 7, Plate X outside the square;20 the signs those shewn in Vol. I, No. 2, Plate \"The Signs of the Grades\". In these invocations he should expand his girth and his stature to the utmost, assuming the form and the consciousness of the elemental god of the quarter. After this, he begins to vibrate the \"Barbarous Names\" of the Ritual.  Air is invoked in the East with a shaft of golden glory, using the invoking Air Pentagram. Draw the appropriate Enochian sigil and make the corresponding N.O.X. sign for this quarter. While vibrating the barbarous words, the visual conception is of Air, glowing yellow, inhabited by the appropriate Guardian from the Star Ruby.

Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost with the force of the Names; but let him formulate his Will, understood thoroughly as the dynamic aspect of his Creative Self, in an appearance symbolically apt, gathering up the Aethyr as a substance from which the Angel will be composed. It will be this image that the Dominus Liminis will pray to in working Liber VIII. Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in this imagined Shape and let it radiate with the Light proper to the element invoked, and let each Word issue along the Shaft with passionate impulse, as if its voice gave command thereto that it should thrust itself leapingly forward. Let also each Word accumulate authority, so that the Head of the Shaft may plunge twice as far for the Second Word as for the First, and Four Times for the Third as the Second, and thus to the end. Moreover, let the Adept fling forth his whole consciousness thither. Then at the final Word, let him bring rushing back his Will within himself, steadily streaming, and let him offer himself to its point, as Artemis to PAN, that this perfectly pure concentration of the Element purge him thoroughly, and possess him with its passion.

He now repeats the signs as before, save that he makes the Passive Invoking Pentagram of Spirit. He concentrates his consciousness29 within his Twin-Symbol of Self,30 and endeavors to send it to sleep. But if the operation be performed properly, his Angel shall have accepted the offering of Dew, and seized with fervor upon the extended symbol of Will towards Himself. This then shall He shake vehemently with vibrations of love reverberating with the Words of the Section. Even in the physical ears of the Philosophus there shall resound an echo thereof, yet he shall not be able to describe it. It shall seem both louder than thunder, and softer than the whisper of the night-wind. It shall at once be inarticulate, and mean more than he hath ever heard. Now let him strive with all the strength of his Soul to withstand the Will of his Angel, concealing himself in the closest cell of the citadel of consciousness. Let him consecrate himself to resist the assault of the Voice and the Vibration until his consciousness faint away into Nothing. For if there abide unabsorbed even one single atom of the false Ego, that atom should stain the virginity of the True Self and profane the Oath; then that atom should be so inflamed by the approach of the Angel that is should overwhelm the rest of the mind, tyrannize over it, and become an insane despot to the total ruin of the realm. But, all being dead to sense, who then is able to strive against the Angel? He shall intensify the stress of His Spirit so that His loyal legions of Lion-Serpents leap from the ambush, awakening the adept to witness their Will and sweep him with them in their enthusiasm, so that he consciously partakes this purpose, and sees in its simplicity the solution of all his perplexities. Thus then shall the Philosophus be aware that he is being swept away through the column of his Will Symbol. and that His Angel is indeed himself, with intimacy so intense as to become identity, and that not in a single Ego, but in every unconscious element that shares in that manifold up-rush. This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost always, and also in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupendous and sublime in all cases, though its character may vary within wide limits.31 The spate of stars shoots from the head32 of the Will-Symbol,33 and is scattered over the sky in glittering galaxies. This dispersion destroys the concentration of the Practicus, whose mind cannot master such multiplicity of majesty; as a rule, he simply sinks stunned into normality, to recall nothing of his experience but a vague though vivid impression of complete release and ineffable rapture. Repetition fortifies him to realize the nature of his attainment; and his Angel, the link once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive to his Holy presence, and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after repeated success, that the Practicus is not flung back into his mortality by the explosion of the Star-spate, but identified with one particular \"Lion-Serpent\", continuing conscious thereof until it finds its proper place in Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a truth, which the Adept may then take back to earth with him. This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to establish the relation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that the Practicus is aware that his Angel is the Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements of that Self, that his normal consciousness contains alien enemies introduced by the accidents of environment, and that his Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys all doubts and delusions, confers all blessings, teaches all truth, and contains all delights. But it is important that the Practicus should not rest in mere inexpressible realization of his rapture, but rouse himself to make the relation submit to analysis, to render it in rational terms, and   29 Consciousness is moved into the symbol by being in Samadhi with it; it is squeezed until it becomes a drop of dew and through the fissure previously made in the Sahasrara. The dew drop is shaped as a Yod; that Gon transliterates into. As the Angel feeds on the dew, the Magickal Link is established. 30 This is the ̳Secret Symbol of Self;‘ the Vedantic twin. 31 These phenomena are not wholly subjective; they may be perceived, though often under other forms, by even the ordinary man. 32 Cf.

The Attainment The Practicus should have realized that his Act of Union with the angel implies35 the death of his old mind save in so far as his unconscious elements preserve its memory when they absorb it, and36 the death of his unconscious elements themselves. But their death is rather a going forth to renew their life through love. He then, by conscious comprehension of them separately and together, becomes the \"Angel\" of his Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voice is Thunder. Thus in this section the Practicus utters articulately so far as words may, what his Angel is to Himself. He says this, with his Scin-Laeca wholly withdrawn into his physical body, constraining His Angel to indwell his heart. 1. I am He! the Bornless Spirit! having sight in the feet: Strong, and the Immortal Fire! \"I am He\" asserts the destruction of the sense of separateness between self and Self. It affirms existence, but of the third person only. \"The Bornless Spirit\" is free of all space, \"having sight in the feet\", that they may choose their own path. \"Strong\" is G B R,37 The Magician escorted by the Sun and the Moon (See Liber D and Liber 777). The \"Immortal Fire\" is the creative Self; impersonal energy cannot perish, no matter what forms it assumes. Combustion is Love. 2. I am He! the Truth! \"Truth\" is the necessary relation of any two things; therefore, although it implies duality, it enables us to conceive of two things as being one thing such that it demands to be defined by complementals. Thus, an hyperbola is a simple idea, but its construction exacts two curves. 3. I am He! Who hate that evil should be wrought in the World! The Angel, as the Practicus knows him, is a being Tiphereth, which obscures Kether. The Practicus is not officially aware of the higher Sephiroth. He cannot perceive, like the Ipsissimus, that all things soever are equally illusion and equally Absolute. He is in Tiphereth, whose office is Redemption, and he deplores the events which have caused the apparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped. He is also aware, even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits and defects of his Attainment. 4. I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth! This refers to the phenomena, which accompany his Attainment. 5. I am He, from whom is the Shower of the Life of Earth! This means the recognition of the Angel as the True Self of his subconscious self, the hidden Life of his physical life. 6. I am He, whose mouth ever flameth! The Practicus realizes every breath, every word of his Angel as charged with creative fire. Tiphereth is the Sun, and the Angel is the spiritual Sun of the Soul of the Adept.   35 That is, Yod He realizing Themselves Will and Understanding in the twins Vau He, Mind and body. 36 But see also the general solution of the Riddle of Existence in The Book of the Law and its Comment - Part IV of Book 4. 37 Gimel , Beth , Resh ; these letters comprise the Hebrew word that translates as ̳mighty‘ and ̳hero.‘"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"7. I am He, the Begetter and Manifester unto the Light! Here is summed the entire process of bringing the conditioned Universe to knowledge of itself through the formula of generation; a soul implants itself in sense-hoodwinked body and reason-fettered mind, makes them aware of their Inmate, and thus to partake of its own consciousness of the Light. 8. I am He, The Grace of the Worlds! \"Grace\" has here its proper sense of \"Pleasantness\". The existence of the Angel is the justification of the device of creation. 9. \"The Heart Girt with a Serpent\" is my name! This line must be studied in the light of Liber LXV (Equinox XI. p. 65). Section H. The \"Charge to the Spirit\" Come thou forth, and follow me: and make all Spirits subject unto Me so that every Spirit of the Firmament, and of the Ether, upon the Earth and under the Earth: on dry Land, or in the Water: of Whirling Air or of rushing Fire, and every Spell and scourge of God, may be obedient unto me! Section J. The Proclamation of the Beast 666 Let I and F face all;38 yet ward their A from attack. The Hermit to himself, the fool to foes, The Hierophant to friends, Nine by nature, Naught by attainment, Five by function. In speech swift, subtle and secret; in thought creative, unbiassed, unbounded; in act gentle, patient and persistent. Now this word SABAF, being by number Three score and Ten, is a name of Ayin, the Eye, and the Devil our Lord, and the Goat of Mendes. He is the Lord of the Sabbath of the Adepts, and is Satan, therefore also the Sun, whose number of Magick is 666, the seal of His servant the BEAST. But again SA is 61, AIN, the Naught of Nuith; BA means go, for Hadit; and F is their Son the Sun who is Ra-Hoor-Khuit. So then let the Practicus set his sigil upon all the words he hath writ in the Book of the Works of his Will. And let him then end all, saying, Such are the Words!39 For by this he maketh proclamation before all them that be about his Circle that these Words are true and puissant, binding what he would bind, and loosing what he would loose. For know that the true Formula40 whose virtue sufficed the Beast in this Attainment, was thus:   38 If we adopt the new orthography VIAOV (Book 4 Part III Chap. V.) we must read \"The Sun-6-the Son\" etc. for \"all\"; and elaborate this interpretation here given in other ways, accordingly. Thus O (of F) will not be \"The Fifteen by function\" instead of \"Five\" etc., and \"in act free, firm, aspiring, ecstatic\", rather than \"gentle\" etc. as in the present text. 39 The consonants of LOGOS, \"Word\", add (Hebrew values: sGL) to 93. And EPH, \"Words\", (whence \"Epic\") has also that value: EIDE TA EPH might be the phrase here intended: its number is 418. This would then assert the accomplishment of the Great Work; this is the natural conclusion of the Ritual. Cf. CCXX. III. 75. 40 The Oracles of Zoroaster utter this: \"And when, by often invoking, all the phantasms are vanished, thou shalt see that Holy and Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashes through all the Depths of the Universe; hear thou the Voice of the Fire! \"A similar Fire flashingly extending through the rushings of Air, or a Fire formless whence cometh the Image of a voice, or even a flashing Light abounding, revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud.

At the time, I was not only new to Thelema, but came to it through my membership in the corporate culture of the Caliphate O.T.O., located in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. For me, this meant being responsible and acting to keep my word. If I volunteered for a project or took on any position of responsibility, I had to make sure that I followed through with proper action. In organizing a camp for the order, I responded to inquiries promptly and led by example. This was done in contrast to my original complaint that the hierarchy could take years to respond to letters of inquiry on joining the order; something that didn‘t make sense to me. Over time, I came to see that keeping one‘s word directly affected the integrity of one‘s personal logos, which of course, is the Sun coming through the sheaths of the self. I recalled a lecture of a college professor of mine from which I took a class on mysticism. She had been instructed by her guru on the importance of such honesty and was sharing with the class, how difficult this could be. With my own rearing on integrity and honesty, particularly from my father (Sun), I immediately took to this lecture. This is something that has stayed strong with me. Cf. my article: Morals and Magickal Integrity. Kaaba by Hebrew valuation is fifteen, the number of the Devil Atu, which is the path that leads from Hod (Practicus) to Tiphareth (Sol). And of course, Crowley has shown SABAF to equal seventy, which is the value of Ayin; the Hebrew letter attributed to the Devil Atu. In the Judeo-Christian tradition from which the Devil archetype emanates, Satan is considered the Prince of this world. And of course, the great arcana here is that Tiphareth (66642) is Satan, the true Christ; so cleverly maligned by demiurgic forces. And Tiphareth has attributed to it, the four Princes of the Holy Tarot. Our deepest nature, our Hadit (Shaitan) is our Sun; our personal Star at the helm of our personal solar system. As per AL I.3: ―Every man and every woman is a star.‖ On AL I.60, it is appropriate here to quote from my article: Ethical Gnosis: And of course, those on the side of the demiurge will see all of this as evil. The ancient images of the Light-Bringer have been shown forth as representative of the author of evil that we might be confounded. And the consoler god has pacified our fears aroused by our ignorance of the mystery of existence so that people in their hearts prefer that consoler god and they are beguiled. Consider together, these verses from Liber AL vel Legis: AL I.60: \"My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to the blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.\"   42 In the Book of Revelations, 666 is given as the number of the anti-Christ. It should now be seen more as the number of the anti-Jesus; the anti-Consoler."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"AL II.50: \"Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in my eyes; & my spangles are purple & green.\" AL III.38: \"So that thy light is in me; & its red flame is as a sword in my hand to push thy order. There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters, (these are the adorations, as thou hast written), as it is said: The light is mine; its rays consume Me: I have made a secret door Into the House of Ra and Tum, Of Khephra and of Ahathoor. I am thy Theban, O Mentu, The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu! By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell. Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit! Bid me within thine House to dwell, O winged snake of light, Hadit! Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!\" To expound upon the relation of these verses, I will quote from my book: Thelemic Qabalah: Notice also, the Blue and Gold in [these] verses; that ―blue & gold‖ that is ―seen of the seeing‖ is Hadit, who is ―Blue‖ (interestingly enough, the color that the Hindu deities are depicted in) consistently, yet shows up as ―gold in the light of my bride;‖ gold, the color of the Sun and Tiphareth (center of the Tree-of-Life and the sixth Sephira; 6 being the only perfect number on the Tree) when united with Nuit (manifest as Ra-Hoor-Khuit). Liber Gon is then, my own formula for approaching the construction of my Holy Guardian Angel. It is my personal approach to Initiation and represents the Gnosis gleaned from my magickal career. As my work has enabled me to perceive the Aethyr43 directly, as a physical force, I have formulated the rite to gather up and mold this substance, enable it with a life force that emanates from my innermost essence; eventually, to work a Vedantic, ̳Gnostic Dialogue,‘ which will be my ̳Knowledge & Conversation.‘ At the time of this creation, there‘s still much preparation needed, before the ritual can be attempted. But such preparation is in process and I‘ve a clarity of mind and a knowledge of this science and art, consistent with one sitting in the Mercury ruled Hod. My body of written work proves this quite efficaciously. The present work crystallizes what I have learned in my magickal career. And now onto the ultimate crystallization, the Knowledge & Conversation of mine Holy Guardian Angel...   43 Cf. my article: Scientific Proof of Levi‘s Aethyr"}]
