Thou art the mighty and unconquered Lord of theUniverse: I am a spark of Thine unutterable Radiance.How should I approach Thee? - but Thou art Everywhere.But Thou hast graciously deigned to call me unto Thee, to this Exorcism of Art, that I may be ThyServant, Thine Adept, O Bright One, O Sun of Glory! Thou hast called me - should I not then hastento Thy Presence?With unwashen hands therefore I come unto Thee, and I lament my wandering from Thee - butThou knowest!Yea, I have done evil!Yea, I have done evil!Yea, I have done evil!Yea, I have done evil!If one blasphemed Thee, why should I therefore forsake Thee? But thou art the Avenger; all is withThee.I bow my neck before Thee; and as once Thy sword was upon it, so am I in Thy hands. Strike if Thouwilt: spare if Thou wilt: but accept me as I am.My trust is in Thee: shall I be confounded? This Ritual of Art; this Forty and Fourfold Invocation; thisSacrifice of Blood - these I do not comprehend.It is enough if I obey Thy decree; did thy fiat go forth for my eternal misery, were it not my joy toexecute Thy Sentence on myself?For why? For that All is in Thee and of Thee; it is enough if I burn up in the intolerable glory of Thypresence.Enough! I turn toward Thy Promise.Doubtful are the Words: Dark are the Ways: but in Thy Words and Ways is Light. Thus then now asever, I enter the Path of Darkness, if haply so I may attain the Light.Hail!"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IIIIStrike, strike the master chord!Draw, draw the Flaming Sword!Crowned Child and Conquering Lord,Horus, avenger!(At every “Thee I invoke,” give Sign of Apophis.)1.1.1.1.O Thou of the Head of the Hawk!
