[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Liber DN Vel Sub figura ND by Bishop Tao To Logos "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Hot Death The DN occurs in Layad1 (Laya D) and on the cover of Liber L. There is the gesture of Venus de Milo, with a D beside it. And there‟s another drawing with an N beside it. This is a drawing of the most common Mudra of the Hindu gods. It means NO FEAR; pointing towards the riddle of Maat‟s Uniculum: No fear is the gear of No Man ### But ###. The DN formula is a very important and deep-seated instinct in us all. I could explain it as the hedonistic formula of sex and death, but much would be lost as it implies more. The Daleth is desire, attraction and the Nun is death but when explaining these as: D the hermeneutic approach, the desire of enlightenment, engagement and integration with whatever is focused upon, and then N is the completion of this desire; the fulfillment, we then see that this formula is the way, which combines the way of the Hermetic Magickian, the warrior and the upright human. The D of DN is Kama or Kamadeva (world of desire), which is a kind of afterlife that means that Kama also goes through „hot death.‟ And the myth is quite clear - he is burnt to ashes. Other myths show him to be castrated, but to no avail, he just becomes better after this. And this is a central mystery of Laiad, which translated in Enochian is as simple as meaning the \"One God.\" (Kama - the Brahma born, the first) The king is dead - long live the king. This instinct or fiat that we may call the way of bud-will; to do and execute our intent in such a manner that it will be done, is what I have identified with the innermost spirit of Perdurabo and   1 Layad or Laiad means „secret‟ in Enochian."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the Book of the Law. It also provides a new level of understanding to the saying by Nuit - \"...But always unto me,\" as we take hold of our desire and formulate our intention and say: I will endure to the end, to fulfillment, as we understand that the Goddess of Nothing must be the end and death to everything - to all that endures. Remember, “The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end.” AL:I.66 AL:II.72 Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine-and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous!-death is the crown of all. So Nuit is also the embodiment of DN as she figures just as well as Venus and Death; being NOT. The difference in the imagery of her, which we choose, will determine and change a lot. As she is Venus, she will arouse us to the forces of life, vigor and will, while if we see her as an nihil (NOT) and death, she is likely to turn us off. Therefore the following saying in the Gnostic Mass is particularly significant. \"...soul of infinite space, before whom Time is ashamed, the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto thee may we attain, unless Thine image be Love.\" So the DN formula is a way of expressing the small actions we do in life - as we can recognize the theme of doing one‟s will without the lust of result herein, as the end is death or just the completion of the favored action. But DN is also illustrative of the main method of climbing the Tree-of-Life. The total focus on one‟s desire and intent will bring one in touch with the corresponding Sephira. The continued focus upon the same, will accumulate more of these powers with the whole being attained as one sorts out the non-fitting elements (belonging to other levels) and who reacts to occurring obstacles with the energized enthusiasm; knowing that such obstacles turned to one‟s own advantage is practically the only victory we can obtain. The Sephira will at last shine with full power as we intimate with the Sephira. So then, as that Sephira is completed and there is nothing more to put into it, our progression will next, lead us to the succeeding Sephira, as we die away from the one we are leaving. There are variations on the Sephiroth and from human to human on how this death phase is experienced. But in general, if the progress goes fast and yet, the obsession on the leaving Sephira is still hard, it will feel like one is dying. And this hard death phase usually occurs while turning to the left on the tree of life (leaving Yesod, Netzach, Tiphareth, Chesed and Chokmah). One then dies away from the ego in its prior form, but is resurrected in a higher mode, as soon one gets back on track on the middle or right pillars. Then one regains the ego back in a higher mode, as consciousness will always manifest in an ego construction. Centaurus Comment: The formula of ON as discussed in Liber Laiad uses the Priestess, seated in Netzach (Venus and a lower manifestation of Binah as much as having a correspondence to Daleth), to take the energy to Tiphareth, by way of Nun (The Death Atu). With this of course, the Veil of Paroketh is pierced and the Magickal Child created. But all manifestation must first coalesce in Briah, where of course, Daleth resides. Note also that Daleth (The Empress Atu) is traditionally rendered as a pregnant woman, certainly giving us the idea of a new birth or incarnation.

What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chosen one, to be me; to follow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word. Osman was my original mentor in the c.O.T.O. I have since come to regard him as a Black Brother as much as a revealer or dark prophet. The insidious nature of his work is found in his solution to the riddle, which draws some of the letters out from AL:II.76 to get Latin roots as follows: AB ALG MOR STO VAL. This translates as “From cold death stand strong.” From the remaining letters he got: Crux = Cross , and through swapping between Latin and Greek letters KRY & PYR = cold & Fire. But the main formula he derived was found by placing the remaining letters in one point, ending with X & P, which is the Greek monogram for Rex Christeous - King Christ, the demiurgic Slave God.2 So; Osman was setting up his project without telling anyone, but under false flag. I watched and partaked as I was sincerely interested in Thelema and OTO. As it grew and got attention and more partakers, i suddenly also saw that none of the newcomers were able to work with the upright tree of life, all of those capable of having a magickally induced vision were reporting things which only could make any sense if we refered these visions as being of the nightside, the underground, the qliphoth, the tree of death. I realized that he had succeeded in breeding a culture   2 Centaurus Note: This is the familiar ChiRo symbol of the Roman Catholic heresy."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"by his many lectures of those days. These lectures were usually ending in discussions which were accompanied by a mixture of \"resonable scepticism\", awe (fear) and romanticism and powerhunger. I saw the potent mix as being of fear towards the impenetrable and unapproacheable mystery; this would prevent people from taking a clear move towards our subjects, but instead release the mystic inside whose way is sinking and assimiliation. But of course, consistency was hard to find, and inconsistency such an appropriate environment of the filthy. The slogan \"From cold death stand strong\" contains a contradiction. It cannot be said that it takes death seriously as the result stands strong. The person, who has died in working this formula, defies that natural destiny of finite beings and is not dead. The employment of this formula simply denies the word or logos of death to function truly as death. Therefore, the formula would be the process of creating the Undead, the Vampire. Magick is about using language to recreate itself in the world, so if the formula of „cold death‟ is employed properly, its results would be to force a lie upon the world; creating demiurgic reality where fake death is death enough, and the supreme result would become an initiation into the legions of the Undead. Really, the likely result of its use would be in gaining access to the Thelemic Qliphoth. Current 23. This current was ready available in those days or maybe in its height, as it had been well bred in europe mostly under the label \"chaos magick\", but I would rather like to name it current 23 as to specify it further. 23 is described as the glyph of nascent life by Crowley, and if I shall pin this further, sperm or ov power are this numbers virtue. Sperm and eggs are symbols of that which isnt yet, but likely will come. It is the number of the hypotetic and the potential. And to us it means expectations, excitement and thrills. Hope and fear are the two reactions which the potential triggers in us. The fear side was unfortunately the only side exposed during the eighties, but as this current was more activated by artists than magickians, a lot of great art music was the result. *The groups; to name some; PTV, Current 93, NWW, Coil, Organum, Lustmord, SPK & 23 Skidoo. Listen to \"The culling is coming\" by 23 Skidoo, to get an impression on how the eighties could be. From my meet with Hadit in 93, I was faced with the premium source of current 23; Hadit in his role as Magickian, vielding the serpent power to the creation of unspeakable excitement. To him there was no question whether we should fear or hope - the full range of tension was his aim. Looking at the concepts of hope and fear, I see fear reduces fast to expectation of death, physical death, while hope reduces fast to expectation of attainment; spiritual (subjective) attainment, and this latter is also some kind of death; the death induced by success. So both leads to death, which is natural as thats what is close to nascent life. Further work on current 23 is likely to occur. Because potential is natural as a doublecurrent too. *The numerical relation of 23 to 93 is ie. 23 + 23 + 1 + 23 +23. This could be used as basic for a formula of serpent worship. The class of hope and fear relates to values and qualities. These are insubstantial but to the subjective mind. Osman didnt care about Chaos magick or any music more modern than Strauss, but used what the air was filled with. He though had his only mentor in UK `83. He only respected Crowley and read him eagerly, to find his warnings, to see how he could exploit these"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"holes. Osman couldnt have succeeded in guiding/trapping so many people into this kind of work, if he hadnt done it himself. And he explained me once in detail how his basic attitude towards sephiroth working or dealing with the personal initiatory current. From this explanation I also recognized ND. On Temperature There are natural attitudes connected to these forms of death. Hot death is a very painful and unattractive form of death; as repulsive to the living being as could be imagined. The physical equivalent of Cold death is probably not well-known in southern climates as it doesn‟t offer such conditions too often. In northern climates, we know that freezing to death is one of the most beautiful ways of dying as told by people rescued from the threshold of it. Coldness is not comfortable to meet, but when the coldness creeps in and takes charge, numbness sets in and an inversion happens. People start to feel very warm and it is reported that many people who have frozen to death have even undressed in the process. From my own experiments in the north, I discovered that on this stage happiness enters and the mood becomes blissful and reckless about any physical and mundane matter. I also learned from experience, the fact I already knew, if any part of the body gets 2nd degree frostbite, that same part of the body becomes particularly vulnerable to frostbite later on. And will be the first part of the body where one will start to freeze, when again, exposed to cold. First-degree frostbite is just the state of receiving the numbness and lack of feeling. This is relatively harmless, yet when getting into the heat again, the numb parts experience pain as they begin to warm up. I have seen that these physical facts do bear a close resemblance with the conditions that appear when using the cold death as a formula for spiritual development. The sign of the cold death complex upon the psyche shows up as a sweet melancholia. Nietzsche‟s fight against Transcendentalism is a part of the history of philosophy now. Leading with the slogan: \"God is dead,\" he argued that the struggle to reach beyond, to the transcendental is in vain, as it is only here in life that spiritual experience can be apprehended. In this light, „From cold death stand strong‟ is a direct and blatant use of Transcendentalism in the worst possible way. It‟s like saying: \"Come here and die and later you will get your reward.\" But as the slogan is self-contradictory and in short just a lie. There is nothing afterwards for those who use this formula; just the Undead and the fallen. And these minions will crumble to dust in the light of the true Sun. The hot death slogan can‟t evoke any path to resurrection, as it simply is the painful end. It shows that death is forever and as such, Life is now and thus the moral becomes: Live Now for tomorrow, we die! The solution to the problem of attaining immortality appears as a signature; by a Fool, BHDT, who is a God and has no physical body. Its Magickal implication is found in accepting this solution as one accepts the so-called mundane reality that is empirically present. This resolves any mixing of the planes3 that one may have acquired earlier. One will no longer   3 On mixing the planes : The candidate on the path has advanced to Yesod and is ready for going, but is reading too much into the religious truths of those Saints that have attained in the past. He or she may resonate with certain conclusions and then incorporates these perspectives into their own ideology. Such ideas as \"the world doesn‟t really exist\" are added into his or her own paradigm as a truth instead of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"accept the idea of altruism and unconditional love etc, if one doesn‟t feel it. It will then make one‟s interaction with the actual paradigm within which one is living, so much more powerful, especially as there are no other interfering paradigms that swallow up the energy one is accumulating. There is sure no life after death, but there may be consciousness, as we know there are discarnate entities, and that consciousness may take the ontological status of zero and still be vital. Life I regard as something that occurs in the process of birth; the appearance of material substance joined with consciousness and containing will. Death I define as the total separation of the will principle from its previous inhabited material. (This definition is made to be able to be used on planes that go higher than Assiah as well.) Today many people are still abusing language as they speak about life after death. I regard this as just being imprecise, but when used in the paradigm of Magick the quality of the error may take on a demiurgic power. The first Magick was writing and language remains the prime tool of the Magickian. It must be concise and it must be protected against the abbreviations of mundane culture. The moral of this I regard as mainly being a recommendation to evaluate one‟s own use of language. The Magickian must be able to accurately express his or her thoughts outside the temple as much as within it. Be aware that one‟s day-to-day use of language is what reflects and defines one‟s daily reality to oneself. One‟s Magick will get more powerful as one proclaims accurately, that, which is substantial in reality; thus referring to actual objects and objectives, rather than talking about expressions one really doesn‟t understand. Work it with knowledge of forethought and learn with your heart, body and mind in depth; get a concrete relation to those expressions that others uses to generate the fog of mindlessness. On False Love My mentor; the false prophet experimented a lot with how to commit the worst possible things with his ability to love. He fell in love with some girl named Asita, and explained this in terms of Gematria, how divinely inspired this love had to be. She was a bright girl who understood that she couldn‟t do anything else, other than simply trying to ignore and avoid this creep.4 So Mr. Slimy did his daily Venus hexagrams to arouse the most embarrassed spirit of love; who really wanted to stay away, and went on his evening promenade to her house, hoping to catch a glimpse of her, through the window. She was married as well, but as she was meant for Mr. Black Adder, he had to rescue her. He cursed her husband; and when the gentleman lost a toe in the lawn       classifying them as a belief. This then prejudices subsequent investigations into the nature of the world and leads to false conclusions. Ideals are good as ideals, when they make us struggle to achieve them, but Magick as a path to illumination is ruthlessly egoistic, it is only the sole viewpoint of yours, which is the main concern. What others see and experience is not your point-of-view, and the ideas of these Saints must be regarded as theories, hypothesizes, testimonies, etc. It is vital to nurture one‟s own viewpoint as it is what can make your egoism flower into something that accurately assesses your environment, as the true sun of ego loves its world and wants to make the best out of its relationship. Therefore, the greatest idealism is founded by a great egoism. The work of sorting out one‟s own reality, classifying things correctly, will at last create a world, which seems far more predictable in course with more accurate observations. The power of one‟s own evaluation becomes enhanced, and becomes an important tool for interacting with the world in a conscious manner. 4 He fed well on contempt and pity too."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mower, Mr. Slack Bladder went out to pubs and clubs, telling everyone what a brilliant Magickian he was. When he told me this story, I really didn‟t understand the implications of this practice, but it all is part of his practice of the Ab Alg Mor Sto Val formula (From cold death stand strong). This formula creates Qliphoth, it turns what‟s in focus to schizophrenia, as the formula itself is contradictory. And yes - its a story of the ND formula. Centaurus comment: Even the cold heart finds value in the beauty of another. But rather than harmonize with such beauty, it seeks to possess it. There is no electromagnetic charge in the cold heart, hence no polarity is possible and by which an harmonic relationship can be formulated. And so the cold heart seeks rather to enslave. Here, the transformation of self into the yearning for another is as a cold death. And in standing strong, one works the Magick of the vampire...standing strong...enslaving that other. The schizophrenia that is the broken heart is as the yearning for another; that one's heart alone is but half the formula or in actuality, half a heart. When it conjoins with the heart of another, then one is complete and whole...a wondrous Alchemy. Cf. AL:I.30: \"This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. \" No we don‟t turn to sadism because of rejection if we‟ve got a reasonable response to that rejection. But I have noticed there are many around that don‟t understand the Thelemic formula of Love under will. For those clinging to the „sacred‟ monogamy and the Christist virtues (that are actually are becoming more and more puritan these days) the law of Love is put ahead of everything else and if love strikes someplace, the tendency is to force it to stay there, even if it doesn‟t work. It is this formula that allows unrequited love to stay around until it turns sour and freezes over. It is natural for the human to compensate for emotions upheld without reason in some way, and as the love upheld in the wrong place causes sorrow and pain, the response from the body machinery is to try to bring it back.5 It‟s just as stupid as the immediate lust of revenge that occurs if a branch fell of a tree and hits one on the head, but it‟s the easiest way to handle the anger caused by a feeling of weakness. As a result we have got something, which resembles the „Double Current‟ (Sadism), but note that it is being itself, which has become splintered. The true schizophrenia is a split or broken heart, approaching the double current in a whole and harmonious manner. Utterance of a Magus So what about me? Am I a Prophet? In that I have channeled new Gnosis, yes! And so was Osman amongst others. As I have been compelled to live through the cowering eighties, I know how many were called to partake in digging out of the pit of pits, but it was Osman who hit an all time low. It seems I have been the only one able to understand his work and a certain torch has been passed to me. Therefore, as seen from Maat‟s Uniculum, the lineage that the secret chiefs will inaugurate, comes through me and my work. I am A prophet among others, and to those of   5 Centaurus Note: This is a physical mourning process; natural and inevitable in a healthy person, but dangerous if not handled in a wholesome manner."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"US, the following applies: \"All words are sacred and all prophets true; save only they understand a little\" AL:I.56.6 This has been my method for gaining wisdom, catch that little understanding and leave the rest. The word STO The solution that I have brought forth catches the essence of Perdurabo,7 the foursquare name to be worshipped as per the prophecy of The Book of the Law. I have purged Osman‟s solution and picked out a word, which is that Will that I have become and from the complexities of the riddle. STO means „stand‟ with several possible interpretations. What I see first and foremost in this is the act of bidding all to rise up, to stand up with dignity and greater awareness in order to bid the world appear as itself. It‟s the appropriate word of an Avatar of Amsu; whose name means rising. And it is concordant with Perdurabo in that it says Persist. It is a word that can initialize the path of Perdurabo in a Karma-yogic8 manner. It is the promotion of the personal and individual life with its Gnostic truths. And the word can also be used for restoring the confused paths and paradigms that is the work of this Aeon of Horus. The resulting, healthy egregore would then become capable of holding and accumulating energy so that our collective life would then evolve and transform in its wake. The way the Qliphoth is integrated in this word so that even if „stand‟ is employed as a verb, it denotes an action which maintains an equilibrium in that it then sets up a span from the right to left pillar where the „Golden Pillar‟ or the „Golden Way‟ is revealed. It is therefore a Yellow School word that can be used at any place on the path; also in Taoist manner. There are also phallic inferences that can be drawn from this. The stoic ideal applies as well; cf. the writings of Zeno, Epicurus and M. Aurelius. The word is no ordinary word of power, and the ritualist may at times be surprised to feel how little power it casts off, or how dead it can be, but its power is a continuance that pervades both creation and realm of the dead, and therefore this continuance is a superior power in that it can hold power. It is perfect. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none! AL:I.45 This word is that one, which is my individuality as discussed above. It is the word of my Magushood. And what is the word of the Magus supposed to be and to contain? As the Magus degree is connected to the Sephira, Chokhmah, it therefore must be the word, which makes the Magickian an harmonius exponent of the powers that the Sephira contains. This Sephira is the place where the creation is conceptualized in a word that contains the inherent divine being and which initiates action. It is of course a Luciferian word like \"let there be light\" or „becoming.‟ The formulation of the Logos is the key to all action and paradigms of the formulator; it is his or her whole system condensed into a singularity. I regard the word STO to be clearly, a catalyst word; reflecting in itself the nature of Kether. In this time, there should come more like words of   6 Centaurus Note: Despite the confusion, there are significant moments in the prophecies coming from Nema and Aquino. Though they are actually in alignment with the forces of the Black Lodge, certain „understandings‟ have come through them that Runar has managed not only to capture, but to address through his own prophetic work. 7 Centaurus Note: See the Fire Opal. 8 The root of ethics lies in the belief that certain structured ways of action will lead to certain results, directly connected to one‟s spiritual equilibrium. Karma yoga is an ancient Hindu method of attainment, which may be approached in several ways. But the way of „Ahimsa‟ may be the most well-known is superficially translated as nonviolence. Sveccachara is the word of an old tantric cult, taken up by the Thelemically inspired Order Amookos, and can be translated as \"following own natural path.\" This is a good example of a Karma-yogic motto, which is also harmonious with Thelema and STO."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"power.

I so did, and the event proceeded, but not in any way as I expected. During the first quarter of the text while she was speaking, the name Wilkinson was chanted slowly and aloud from all quarters of the world. To say that I was surprised is an understatement. The passage \"Manyfold is bound to gloom\" was chanted by a sudden choir of unspeakable beauty. I was beginning to realize that I was having audience with the Mother of Theater. And she was not in her best mood. I became increasingly divided within as the text proceeded and as the riddle suddenly was announced; something in me was taking completely control and I wrote down the words in the full conviction that I understood and was able to interfere.

The main and great work to come is the revitalize the Hermopolis school of Magick, The Ogdoad of Tahuti. This school is dated to have started about 2200-2000 BC, but it preceedes all the others. That it grew to a size which took the hold of a whole city is due to the success of the schools of the Ennead. The Ennead is the basic magick, while the Ogdoadic mysteries all take place in the transcendent; outside the creation. The success of the ennead school in initiating more people was the possibility to formulate the Hermopolitan school. Tahuti and his adepts was busy with setting up the ennead schools before this time. There is no need to create structures around the Tahutian school of magick as its done around the Orders which deals with the Tree of Life. The partakers of the Ogdoad are far more than adepts; they see through all things as they are dead and masked. There cannot be any charlatans connected herein, for the connection that is vital for community herein is but real - its the connections that are basic, as a unique star to another unique star. I have no intention of being the one who reinitializes the Ogdoad, but the signs of the time is clear to me. The wasteland beyond is stirred and i meet and get letters from people which dont ask for exactly basic questions on reality - revealing clearly that their area of concern is lofty. The ancient adepts are stirred, and they shall increasingly be stirred untill Tahuti is fully awakened and reformulates his wisdom for this aeon. Nema didnt go for setting up any Ogdoad either; but she managed to get a group to engage in ToL workings; that is the Ennead school. So do I, but in the A:.A:., and there the sephiroth workings are different. This btw, takes most of my time. There is no need at this time to set up the Ogdoad, but getting the education system aright - whose purpose is to extol and align our microcosmos in and with the macrocosmos. Thereby can we obtain Moksha and be free of and to our own human nature as well as creation with its necessities. Maats uniculum has as its purpose to capture the final essence of us and lead us behind the foundation of nothing. There where truth can exist independently without having to give of itself as a medium of measurement. It will take the Hadit in you and quench it, leaving only the secret Hadit to persist - The hidden god is a part of the Ogdoad, as Amen. The unknown factor. So this work will be able to initate one further from the heights which a proper and serious order of today can raise one to. It is supported by Maat herself, and she will also guide her devotees from the day they make their commitment. On the practice, there is to say that I have been ordered to chew on my first and wild rites of Maat as I did them 15 yrs ago. I anyway believe those close to this mystery can get what they need directly from Maat. The work is likely to include sexual communion with the Godess.

I wrote this sometime in 98 to the eq-list: Kenneth Grant did take up up many of the themes from Liber Pennae Praenumbra and also the story behind this receiving, in what I consider as his best and most interesting book \"Outside the circles of time\". I believe it was him which translated the word into that translation which Nema has kept on using. Ipsos is the word, and Grant saw this as a word composed by two latin words; Ipse and Os ( self -same and mouth) and the translation became \"by the same mouth\".(Ipse is btw also the root of the degree of Kether Ipsissimus.) This I am convinced is wrong, (though Nemas thoughts around \"the same mouth\" is not and does stand without support.) Ipsos does not have to be seen as a composite word since Ipsos is a word in itself and is used in latin. It is the masculine, plural and accusative form of Ipse and Themselves is the proper translation. The way the word appears in the text seems actually to be done deliberate - to confuse. It is shown or spoken in nearly the end of the text, - but it is spoken about in nearly the beginning of the book. Thereby it becomes easy to neglect the context it first appears in - when contemplating on the word - where it appears. Here follows a quotation of the part of the text where the word is written and I would say that my translation makes sense to this context. LPP: \"But now ! As priests within the Temple are ye here, as Kings and Warriors, Magickians all. The way is in the work. The Hidden one of the Abyss now gives the two wherein is wrought the higher alchemy: Supporting Earth is Chthonos - learn it well, and all bonds shall be loosened for the Will's working. Surmounting spirit, there is Ychronos, whose nature is duration and the passing- away thereof. The two are one, and form the Kingdom's essence. Who masters them is Master of the world. They are the utter keys of transmutation, and keys of the Power of the other elements. The Warrior-priests received the Keys, and placed them within their robes, to hold them hidden well above their hearts. The Black Flame danced and dwindled, becoming small, a quill pen, plumed and pointed. There being naught upon which to write, one among the Priests came forth, and laid his body's skin upon the altar as living parchment. She-who-moves wrote thereupon a word, but shew it not before them. In patience waited all the Kings and Hermits, assured full well of final understanding.

Medicine uses only the diagnosis (secondhand knowledge)- checking the symptoms for stating death. While The magician needs more as he encounters several levels where the substances are different and life may be apparent. I made a definition of death which is made to the magickian and his need to determine status quo on the levels he/she may encounter. My definition of Death is: The total separation between an object and its ideal functioning. (will). This definition makes the entire universe to a living thing - A stone is living in so far it is a stone. Unless one makes this stone become sand, it will remain stone. When applying this to humans, one sees there are those that are able to completely close the inspiration that derives from its ideal of functioning. Like some of the few hard and psychiatric cases that criminals may be. They cannot be seen to conform to this definition and may therefore be termed undead, and then specified into classes as zombies, vampires. The magickian may also encounter other rare cases. The energies which are directly contradictory (i.e. fire which doesnt burn or is not-fire) are not of the same reality as the usual elements. These can in general be considered qliphotic, as the qliphoth is of that other side or tree of death. However, the inherent threat of this verse lies latent in the first will of any thing; the will to to remain and to preserve itself as it was. Herein lies the temptation of restriction lurking, and when restriction have been duly misapplied; by those who doesn‟t see the spirit and doesn‟t feel the values to reformulate, but only preserves the form - war and revolt in any form seems to be the natural answer to heavy coagulated constructions. 6"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Careless - Ruthless- Bloodgeysirs- the outpouring of laments together with the release of Power - Freed Power. 7 I am AMSU, I am old. - My Love is unconditionally and wild.

Even you, who delivered the Diabolicon from Asia, did not know it for what it was. But he that I had fashioned a Magus knew, and he thought often of the Diabolicon as he guided the Church of Satan. Upon the ninth solstice, therefore, I destroyed my pact with Anton Szandor LaVey, and I raised him to the Will of a Daimon, unbounded by the material dimensions. And so I thought to honor him beyond other men. But it may have been this act of mine that ordained his fall. Were I my self to displace the cosmic inertia, I should be forced to become a new measure of consistency. I would cease to be One, for I should become All. To make of man a daimon, then, may be to break his Self-reference to the bounds in which his semblance must exist. I cannot undo the hurt that has come of this, but I shall restore to Anton Szandor LaVey his human aspect and his degree of Magus in my Order. Thus all may understand that he is dearly held by me, and that the end of the Church of Satan is not a thing of shame to him. But a new Aeon is now to begin, and the work of Anton Szandor LaVey is done. Let him be at ease, For no other man has ever seen with his eyes. In April of the common year 1904, I came forth in Africa as my Opposite Self and brought into being an Aeon to end the horrors of the stasis of the death-gods of men. This new Aeon was a purification, to prepare men for that which would follow it. And Aleister Crowley received the Book of the Law, and my Opposite Self declared him Magus of the Aeon. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"But HarWer, my Opposite Self, is a strange and fitful presence. I, Set, am my Self distinct from the Order of the Cosmos, yet am ordered in and of my Self. HarWer I was when I was once part of the Cosmos and could achieve identity only be becoming what the cosmic order was not. By HarWer I cancelled the imbalance, leaving a void in which true Creation could take form as Set. But, as I have said, I cannot destroy the cosmic inertia without having to assume its place. And so HarWer must exist while Set exists. The Aeon of Harwer endured until the Equinox of the common year 1966, when Harwer and Set were fused as one composite being. And so commenced the time of Set-HarWer - known as the Age of Satan - which was to bridge the expiring Aeon of HarWer and the Forthcoming Aeon of Set. Truth there was in the words of my Opposite Self, but a truth ever tinged with the inconsistency and irrationality of which I have spoken. And so the Book of the Law was confusion to all who came upon it, and the creative brilliance of the Magus Aleister Crowley was ever flawed by mindless destructiveness. He himself could never understand this, for he perceived HarWer as a unified Self. And so he was perplexed by a mystery he could not identify. And I, Set, spoke too in the Book of the Law - \"Aye! listen to the Numbers and the words - 4638 ABK 24 ALGMOR 3Y x (24) (89) RPSTOVAL - \"What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest Not; now shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it.\" And many of the Aeon of HarWer sought to read this but could not. Nor could the Magus himself, though he guessed rightly at its simplicity. It was said that every number is Infinite - hence each number or sum of joined numbers became merely the corresponding letter. Even so the sequence remained unknown - and so, after its issue, to me as well. For, while I may pass free of the boundaries of time, memory of the future cannot exist. Now it has come to pass, and the Book of the Law is laid bare - \"Destined First Century heir - Aquino - breaking keys of doctrines Anton LaVey - great Magus of Reconsecration coming Year Xeper - Founding his rightful Priesthood - Set - true origin Volume AL.\" Michael Aquino, you are become Magus V of the Aeon of Set. I, Set, am come again to my Friends among mankind - Let my great Nobles be brought to me. In Khem I remain no longer, For I am forgotten there, and my house at PaMat-et is dust. I shall roam this world, and I shall come to those who seek me. Magus of my Aeon - Manifest the Will of Set."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Reconsecrate my Temple and my Order in the true name of Set. No longer will I accept the bastard title of a hebrew fiend. When I came first to this world, I gave to you my great pentagram, timeless measure of beauty through proportion. And it was shown inverse, that creation and change be exalted above rest and preservation. With the years my pentagram was corrupted, yet time has not the power to destroy it. Its position was restored by the Church of Satan, but its essence was dimmed with the Moorish Name, and the perverse letters of the hebrews, and the goat of decadent Khar. During the Age of Satan I allowed this curious corruption, for it was meant to do me honor as I was then perceived. But this is now my Aeon, and my pentagram is again to be pure in its splendor. Cast aside the corruptions, that the pentagram of Set may shine forth. Let all who seek me be never without it, openly and with pride, for by it I shall know them. Let the one who aspires to my knowledge be called by the name Setian. I seek my Elect and none other, for mankind now hastens toward an annihilation which none but the elect may hope to avoid. And alone I cannot preserve my Elect, but I would teach them and strengthen their Will against the coming peril, that they and their blood may endure. To do this I must give further of my own essence to my Elect, and, should they fail, the Majesty of Set shall fade and be ended. Behold, it is I who call you, because you are the guardians of the Aeon of Set, zealous in what you do. The Satanist thought to approach Satan through ritual. Now let the Setian shun all recitation, for the text of another is an affront to the Self. Speak rather to me as to a Friend, gently and without fear, and I shall hear as a friend. Do not bend your knee nor drop your eye, for such things were not done in my house at PaMat-et. But speak to me at night, for the sky then becomes an entrance and not a barrier. And those who call me the Prince of Darkness do me no dishonor. The Setian need conjure neither curse nor kindness from me, for by the magic of my great pentagram I shall see with his eyes. And then the strength that is mine shall be the strength of the Setian, and against the Will of Set no creature of the universe may stand. And I think not of those who think not of me. The years of the Aeon of HarWer were confused, and I do not wish to think of them save as curiosities. But I wish to remember the Church of Satan and the Magus of that Age. Therefore let the years of my Aeon by counted from the conception of the Church of Satan. And now, having looked upon the past with affection and reverence, we shall turn our gaze to the times before us. Think carefully of the Word of Set, for it is given in witness to my Bond. Behold, O West, I have established my Aeon. I punish the enemies who are in it, placed in the Place of Destruction. I deliver them to the examiners from whose guard there is no escape. Lo, I pass near to thee, I pass near to thee!

The Word of the Aeon of Set is  Xeper - - Become. "}]
