Subtly enough, this change came about bydiverting me from the public action to which I had so long beenbound by the sheer necessity of producing The Equinox on definitedates. I began to pay more attention to my own personal progress.It must here be explained that my innate diffidence forbad me toaspire to the Grade of Magus in any full sense. Such beings appearonly in every two thousand years or so. I knew too well my ownlimitations. It is true that I had been used as a Magus in the Cairoworking; that is, I had been chosen to utter the Word of a New Aeon.But I did not regard this as being my Word. I felt myself ridiculouslyunworthy of the position assigned to me in The Book of the Lawitself. When therefore I proposed to devote myself to my owninitiations, I meant no more than this: that I would try to perfectmyself in the understanding and powers proper to a Master of theTemple. At the end of 1913, I found myself in Paris with a Zelator of theOrder, Frater L.T. I had been working on the theory of the magicalmethod of the O.T.O.; and we decided to test my conclusions by aseries of invocations.We began work on the first day of the year and continued withoutinterruption for six weeks. We invoked the gods Mercury andJupiter; and obtained many astonishing results of many kinds,ranging from spiritual illumination to physical phenomena. It isimpossible to transcribe the entire record, and to give excerpts wouldonly convey a most imperfect and misleading idea of the result. Asan example of actual intellectual illumination, however, I may quote"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the very impressive identification of the Christ of the gospels withMercury. This came as a complete surprise, we having till thenconsidered him as an entirely solar symbol connected especially withDionysus, Mithras and Osiris.Our occasional failures produced results as striking and instructiveas our successes. For instance, having made an error in invokingMercury, and thus having created a current of force contrary to hisnature, we observed that events of a Mercurial character, no matterhow normal, failed to occur. For one thing, all communications withthe outer world were completely cut off for sometime. It had beenarranged that I should receive a daily report from London from mysecretary. None arrived for five days; and that although nothing hadgone wrong in London. No explanation was ever forthcoming. Thisis one of the many incidents tending to similar conclusions, allexplicable only on the theory that the natural energy, which isnormally present and is necessary to the occurrence of certain typesof event, had somehow been inhibited.The Jupiterian phenomena were especially remarkable. Weperformed in all sixteen operations to invoke this force. It seemed atfirst as if our work actually increased the normal inertia. Jupiterianphenomena which we had every right to expect simply failed tohappen. Even in the matter of banqueting, which we were supposedto do lavishly in his honour, the opposition became overwhelming.Hungry as we might be, we seemed unable to force ourselves to eateven a light meal. Quite suddenly the invisible barrier broke downand Jupiterian phonemena of the most unexpected kind simply rainedon us. To mention one incident only; a Brother who had always beendesperately poor suddenly came into a fortune and insisted oncontributing five hundred pounds to the use of the Order.I must mention one incident of the Paris working as being ofgeneral interest, outside technical Magick. During the operation I hada bad attack of influenza, which settled down to very severebronchitis. I was visited one evening by an old friend of mine and heryoung man, who very kindly and sensibly suggested that I shouldfind relief if I smoked a few pipes of opium.1 They accordingly1 Opium, by the way, is sacred to Jupiter, and to Chesed, Mercy, as being"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"brought the apparatus from their apartment and we began. Mybronchitis vanished; I went off to sleep; my guests retiring withoutwaking me. In my sleep I dreamt; and when I woke the dreamremained absolutely perfect in my consciousness, down to theminutest details. It was a story, a subtle exposure of Englishstupidity, set in a frame of the craziest and most fantasticallygorgeous workmanship. Ill as I was, I jumped out of bed and wrotedown the story offhand. I called it \"The Strategem\". No doubt it wasinspired by Jupiter, for it was the first short story that I had everwritten which was accepted at once. More: I was told  nothing inmy life ever made me prouder  that Joseph Conrad said it was thebest short story he had read in ten years.We ourselves became identified with Jupiter, but in differentaspects. Frater L.T. was for some months following thepersonification of generosity, through himself with the most meagreresources. All sorts of strangers planted themselves on him and heentertained them. In my own case, I became that type of Jupiterwhich we connect with the idea of prosperity, authority andamativeness. I received numerous occult dignities; I seemed to haveplenty of money without quite knowing how it happened; and I foundmyself exercising an almost uncanny attraction upon every womanthat came into my circle of acquaintance.To me, however, as a student of nature, the one important result ofthis work was the proof of the efficacy of the magical methodemployed. Henceforth, I made it my principal study, kept a detailedrecord of my researches, and began to discover the rationalexplanation of its operation and the conditions of success.More important yet, in the deepest sense, was a feature of theresult which I failed to observe at the time, and even for some yearsafter. In veiled language are hints, unmistakable as soon a detected,that I was even then, by means of the working itself, being preparedfor the initiation thereto. The actual ceremony (using the word in itswidest and deepest sense) extended over some years and is in fact thesole key to the events of that period.sovereign against pain, and also as enabling the soul to free itself from its grossintegument and realize its majesty."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"LIBER CDXVThe Paris Working9 = 28 A.A.The Book of the High Magick Artthat was Worked byFrater O.S.V. 6 = 58 and Frater L.T. 2 = 98(JanuaryFebruary 1914 E.V.)1This is the preliminary account of this Operation of Magick Art.SOL IN LIBRA, An.

Thenimmediately did Mercury manifest in his first form, as it is written in“Liber Ararita” I:8: “Thou hast appeared to me as a young boy mischievous and lovely,with thy winged globe and its serpents set upon a staff.”Astrally the Temple was full of thousands of flashing Caducei ofgold and yellow, the serpents alive, and moving, Hermes bearingthem.

The Versicle began at 11:40 and ended at 11:55 circa.Immediately Fra. L.T. completely lost control; although a man ofsome education, degraded himself and dispersed the holy invokedPrana by defacing this volume with the meaningless scrawlsopposite, declaring them to be the inspiration of Thoth which wereunworthy even of his ape. In this way a great part of the virtue of theRite was lost. Some results were however obtained, and these were recorded inthe esoteric account of this Working.

The sub-title of the book is BIA, which is said to mean'force'.Every drop of semen which Hermes sheds is a world. Thetechnical term for this semen is KR. Those worlds are held inchains, but invisibly. People upon the worlds are like maggots uponan appleall forms of life bred by the worlds are in the nature ofparasites. Pure worlds are flaming globes, each a conscious being.Number of worlds ejected, 7,482,135 = $.The name of this Phallus is Thoth, Hermes or Ma. Ma is the godwho seduced the Phallus away from the yoni; hence the physicalUniverse. All worlds are excreta; they represent wasted semen.Therefore all is blasphemy.

The only way to be really born is by annihilationto be borninto Chaos, where Pan is the Saviour.I may say no more because the process is secret.With regard to Genesis; when Adam died, Heva becamemasculine, in order to escape the temptations of the serpent; but shefailed. Her failure cut the serpent in two; hence the Caduceus:because if there were only one serpent, Hermes could not be themessenger of the gods. It is the quality of this serpent business thatgives Him power to travel.

You canget magic force from either women or men; but to use the former ismore dangerous to the career of the magician, and there is the dangerof impregnation, which, however, can be guarded against in theobvious way.In order to get this god more perfectly, a cock should be slain inhis honour, and the blood drunk, as a sacrament. The throat of thecock should be cut over the great image that is upon the altar; theimage should be placed in a vessel so as to catch the blood.He should be invoked on 8 consecutive nights, beginning withWednesday. He says we should feed in greater abundance: he willprotect us. There is a gate to knock down between us and mastery ofthe Universe; and Frater L.T. has a fault, which is introspection. Thepoint is that he is a man of thought, rather than of action. O.S.V. hasalso faults; his chief fault is contradiction.

Of course the linga andyoni are only convenient standards of reduction: the point is thatillusions destroyed leave no trace or effect, but merely vanish. Asthis process becomes general in one's life, it really diminishes one'suniverse. The bourgeois is subconsciously aware that this mustresult, and is therefore right in his own way in refusing to destroyeven one illusion, and in persecuting those who shatter them. Alsothere is only one right path; to either side leads not merely off, but tothe abyss. I remember in my dream mimicking the bourgeois a-tiptoemarking time, trembling and blind.

They must not be admitted to the invocations of male gods.L.T.:What is the immediate task?O.S.V.:The four-fold invocation of Juppiter should have been performed four times; this week, however, it has been interfered with by “The Mass of the Phoenix”. You will therefore employ it in experiments, invoking Priapus, Bacchus, Mars, unless you find suitable women. You must bevery careful with Mars, if you invoke Him. If it is still necessary to invoke Juppiter, begin on Monday, four times a week, for four weeks. But why should it be necessary? Abramelin squares may be used as Versicles. This was the use of the child in the Abramelin operation.1 Respectability is the greatest of all blinds. The general key in reading ancient documents of a magical nature, is to suspect the worst.

Aswe conquer the conditions of a planet, we incarnate on the nextplanet inward until we return to the Father of All, when ourexperiences link together, become intelligible, and star speaks to star.Terra is the last planet where bodies are made of earth; in Venus theyare fluid; on Mercury aerial; while in the Sun they are fashioned ofpure fire. It is most important to develop the fluid body, to pack awayall your powers in it. He insists on the importance of a pure body,instancing Frater AaTaOon as an example of a failure to do this.I now see the eight-fold star of Mercury suddenly blazing out, it iscomposed of four fleurs-de-lys with rays like antlers, bulrushes inshape between them.

There is no middle pathfor it is impossible to escape the ring of divine karma created.In any series of Rites the roles of the celebrants should not beinterchangeable.

In this death-like trance the spirit becomesfree to wander, and is united to the invoked God. In the case of deaththis is permanent, and goes to increase the body of the God on theplanet. We should, therefore, when we can, obtain a closed andinviolable precinct, and slay therein victims daily. In the meantime,let one of the Brethren at least be reduced always to exhaustion bywine, and by the infliction of wounds, and by the ceremony itself.And if he utter oracles, let them be not consciously given.

Shewas finally choked in the bull's blood (in orgasmo). Within theTemple was a circular domed shrine about 40 feet across.2 Thepriestesses used to carry their offerings to the altar of Incense in the1 Asteria is the exact name of the Great Mother Goddess in Tyre.

Globes of fireused to gather on the font, and from the other altar, and begin torevolve in the shrine.They would coalesce and then become one, which stood singleand unmoving all night, only fading with dawn. Astarte surprised thesecret, and penetrated into the shrine at the midnight sacrifice andadoration of this globe. She was slain instantly by the priests, whopassed their swords again and again through her body. This deathwas extreme pleasure. The body was thrown out upon the court at thefoot of the Temple steps, and made tabu, so that it might be“devoured by the Sun”.She had incurred this incarnation as the result of variousmisdemeanors in Greece about an hundred years before. Herincarnations had always been at short intervals. It appears that in thebeginning most people cannot bear frequent incarnations, and needlong restorative periods of rest and peace. But superior spirits take agreat oath, and get on faster. They suffer more in proportion. Youcan recognize them by sensitiveness, which is sometimes in thepainful or morbid degree. This is the case when the Great Work hasbeen forgotten for an incarnation, or a part of it; the idea is to impressthe fact of the oath upon the sufferer.Astarte in her Grecian avatar had been a rather worldly priest. Herchildhood was one of great misery. She had been taken by piratesand ill-treatedshe came from Leghorn or its neighbourhood. Aship-wreck left her on the coast of Sicily. People found her, andfinding her an excellent prostitute (she was now 14), put her in abrothel. She hated the life. At a spring festival she was lucky enoughto attract a young priest who took her, put her through a year'spurification, and added her to the Temple staff. But she only saw adull routine, though applying herself to advancement in herprofession by the skill of her embraces. However, by the age of 20 orthere-abouts she “got religion”, and began to act con amore. Fromthis time she was rather the terror of the Temple. She used to dostrange things, excesses, record-breaking acts, and so on. In fact shewas a little mad; had a touch of the Sun, as it were. However, she gotthe name of being inspired now and then, and was used in some of1 The door of this shrine was in the North; in the South was a statue of a Sun-God of a Syrian typerather more like Bacchus than Apollo."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"the public ceremonies.

In this way she made him tellher the secret of the Temple; she then killed him the same night, sothat he should never betray the fact that he had betrayed theMysteries.She was a slim, lean, nervous girl with a long face, a Roman nose,rather full lips, very strong from constant exercise, a habit ofwriggling as if consumed by an inward itch, abundant and very wiryblack hair which she sometimes dyed, very strong and very sharp andwhite regular teeth, deep violet eyes, very wide apart, and setobliquely like Chinese eyes.

Half measures were punished by havingtheir testicles removed by a special instrument on the principle of acandle-snuffer, but with a regular cup instead of a guard. After the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"operation the instrument was thrust upon the brazier, and the manwas thrust into the earthquake fissure, where he perished miserably.When all the flesh was gone, and the bones had dropped to thebottom, the next initiation could take place.This Temple had pillars, a black floor shining like glass, mirrorsto render the chase difficult. There were three priests, the lion-mask,the bull-mask, and the eagle-mask.The initiate himself was the Fourth Kerub. These mysteries arethe sameor very nearly the sameas the Samothracian mysteries.O.S.V. had 28 handmaidens. She was dressed in silver tissues,representing the way in which the moon slips away from the sun, andthen falls back into his embraces: that is the idea of the dance.O.S.V.'s name was Aia, which is really Gaia.Twelve virgins were sacrificed annually, one a month.Released on menstruation, because they became inpure, and socould not live in the Temple.This is the great idea of magicians in all time:To obtain a Messiah by some adaptation of the sexual process.In Assyria they tried incest; also in Egypt; the Egyptians triedbrothers and sisters, the Assyrians mothers and sons. Phoenicianstried fathers and daughters; Greeks and Syrians mostly bestiality.This idea came from India. The Jews sought to do this by invocationmethods.1 The Mohammedans tried homosexuality; mediaevalphilosophers tried to produce homunculi by making chemicalexperiments with semen.But the root idea is that any form of procreation other than thenormal is likely to produce results of a magical character.Either the father of the child should be a symbol of the sun, or themother a symbol of the moon.SPRING CEREMONIES IN CRETEThere was a labyinth there; they had the worship of Apis from Egypt.2There was a sacred bull in this labryinth, quite white.

You don't want to in the least; thatis because we both have hold of the wrong end of the stick. If only Icould leave you, and you could love me. It would be lucky.” But thathas apparently never happened. Mutual indifference and mutualpassion, and so on.ÇWe played instruments in Corinth as girls.? had white skin. L.T. Chryssipe had yellow hair. O.S.V.We made popular Lesbian songs all day We went on for years, and years, and years. We were sixty, andterribly famous ... Like Zena and Phyllis Dare. This devotion of oursbecame proverbial in Corinth; we had to keep it up, exactly like avicar and his wife in public.After forty-three and a half years it got awful: then we retired toour country estates; but we had the habit over there. We turned intoold maids. We had really loved with the most intense and truepassion for a year or so; and then kept it up for profit.1 ?

O.S.V. being completely exhausted. TheJovian pheonomena continue with steadiness, but not with such forceas to enable to say that the success of the operation is assured. Duringthe afternoon we went to the house of a lay sister, and invoked theLord Juppiter by incense of his sacred herb. This rested us mentallyand physically, but caused some illness of a slight and temporaryorder.OPUS XVThe Fifteenth Working[Wednesday, Jan. 28Thursday, Jan. 29.]The Temple opened at 11.15 P.M. and closed at 12:10. But theversicle was prolonged and very quiet, probably owing to theexperience of the afternoon. Hence the force was coherent, crescentin a flat curve, but very strong in its culmination. The atmosphere ofthe Temple is now extremely good, not only in the ceremonies, whenit is mellow, rich, velvety, luminous (purple, gold, green are the chiefcolours) strong without violence, calm, opulent, etc, etc, butthroughout the day.

The planetary spirits bythe way are now plain to see, next week the God demands that theimage shall be placed in a vesica, and a sparrow (or if not a pigeon)shall be slain therein before the Accendat, with these words: “Nuncflavi Jovi spumantem sanguine sævo passerem”or such otherwords as may be suggested by the Art-Batchelor W.

The blood onlyof a sparrow is to remain in the vesica, and to be connected (after theVersicle) with the magi by the Sigil & on L.T's heart, right breast, leftbreast and navel on the four nights. The body is to be burnt for thelast 4 nights both flesh and blood are to be sacrificed.

A marvellousmatter followed, but no further rite was accomplished. At 1 A.M. Fra.L.T. was still too exhausted to speak. O.S.V. doubts if he did well toavoid the apparent and obvious meaning of the instructionvouchsafed last Thursday night. This should be decided by the eventsof TuesdayThursday.
