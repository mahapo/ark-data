In the Sign of the Enterer he reaches West across the Altar, and cries: Hail Ra, that goest in Thy bark Into the Caverns of the Dark! He gives the sign of Silence, and takes the Bell, and Fire, in his hands. East of the Altar see me stand With Light and Musick in mine hand! He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell 3 3 3ó5 5 5 5 5ó3 3 3 and places the Fire in the Thurible. I strike the Bell: I light the flame: I utter the mysterious Name. ABRAHADABRA He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell. Now I begin to pray: Thou Child, Holy Thy name and undefiled! Thy reign is come: Thy will is done. Here is the Bread; here is the Blood. Bring me from midnight to the Sun! Save me from Evil and from Good! That Thy one crown of all the Ten Even now and here be mine. AMEN.

He makes them as in Liber Legis,1 and strikes again Eleven times upon the Bell. With the Burin he then makes upon his breast the proper sign.2 Behold this bleeding breast of mine Gashed with the sacramental sign! He puts the second Cake to the wound. I staunch the blood; the wafer soaks It up, and the high priest invokes! He eats the second Cake. This Bread I eat. This Oath I swear As I enflame myself with prayer: ìThere is no grace: there is no guilt: This is the Law: DO WHAT THOU WILT!î He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell, and cries ABRAHADABRA. I entered in with woe; with mirth I now go forth, and with thanksgiving, To do my pleasure on the earth Among the legions of the living. He goeth forth. 1 [This is generally taken to refer to the four stanzas of Crowleyís paraphrase from the StÈlÈ in cap.
