II Other Pantacles were obtained in a similar manner. Here (Plate II.) is the principal one,3 which, carved in wax, was placed upon the top of the table. On four others stood the feet of the table.4 Note first the Holy Sevenfold Table containing seven Names of God which not even the Angels are able to pronounce.

He symbolized the Four-Dimensional Universe in two dimensions as a square surrounded by 30 concentric circles (the 30 ∆thyrs or Aires) whose radii increase in a geometrical proportion. The sides of the square are the four great watch-towers (Plates IV.-VII.) which are attributed to the elements. There is also a ìblack crossî (or ìcentral tabletî according to the arrangement shewnócompare the black cross bordering the tablets in Plate III. with Plate VIII.).6 Plate III gives the general view. [The reversed letters which form the word PARAOAN are written in Enochian for convenience, as our A and O are not distinguishable reverse from forward.] Plate IV. gives the complete attribution of the tablet of Air. The 6th file is called Linea Patris. The 7th file is called Linea Filii. The 7th line is called Linea Spiritus Sancti. This great cross divides the Tablet into four lesser (sub-elemental) Tablets, the left-hand top corner being Air of Air, the right-hand top corner Water of Air, the left-hand bottom corner Earth of Air, the remaining corner Fire of Air. Each of these lesser Tablets contains a Calvary Cross of ten squares, which governs it. Plates V., VI., and VII. are similar for the other elements. This is the way in which the names are drawn from the great Tablets. [Examples taken from Water Tablet.] 1. Linea Spiritus Sancti gives the Three Holy Names of God of 3, 4 and 5 letters respectively. MPH. ARSL. GAIOL 2. A whorl around the centre of the Tablet gives the name of the Great Elemental King, RAAGIOSL [similarly for Air BATAIVAH, for Earth ICZHHCAL, for Fire EDLPRNAA]."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 53. The 3 lines of the central cross of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost give the names of 6 seniors.

These three sets of names rule the whole tablet, and must be invoked before specializing in the lesser angles of the sub-elements. 4. The Calvary Crosses. The name upon the cross read vertically is the name which calls forth the powers of the lesser angle.7 NELAPR (water of water) OLGOTA (air of water) MALADI (earth of water) IAAASD (fire of water) The name read horizontally on the cross is that which compels the evoked force to obedience. OMEBB (water of water) AALCO (air of water) OCAAD (earth of water) ATAPA (fire of water) 5. Above the bar of the Calvary Cross remain in each case four squares. These are allotted to the Kerubim, who must next be invoked.8 They are TDIM  DIMT  IMTD  MTDI, being metatheses of there four letters. The initial determines the file governed; e.g. TDIM governs the file which reads T(o)ILVR. These angels are most mighty and benevolent. They are ruled by names of God formed by prefixing the appropriate letter from the ìblack-crossî to their own names."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE 6THE FOUR GREAT WATCH-TOWERS AND THE BLACK CROSS WITHIN GENERAL VIEW9 PLATE III r Z i l a f AytlpaeTa OAdvptDnima r d Z a i dpaLam aa lcooromebbc z o n s a roYaubxTo gconzinlGmT o i T t x oPacoCanh odDialaaocS i g a s o mrbznhrpa tAxioVsps] f m o n d a TdiaripSa aIzaarVroio r o i b A h aoz pi mp h a r s l g a i o lc N a b a V ixgazdhMa mgloinLirx^ i i i t T palOai ol aaDagaTapa[ b a m o o oaCucaCpa LcoidxPacnN a o c O T tnpratond azNziUaasao c a n m a gotroimii dPonsdAspIS h i a l r apmzoxaxr inhtarndi\\ m o t i b aTnan na nTa bitomb o a Z a R ophaRaado npaTdanVaau N n a x o PSondn ol oaGeoobavaa i g r a n oomaggmOP amnoOGmdnmo r p m n i ngbealoab lsTedecaopr s O n i z irlemuCsc miaonAmloxI z i n r C ziaMhlhVa rsGdLbriapM O r d i a lh C t G a o i PteaapDoce` O a n c c hiasompps uacnrZirZa[r b i z m iilpiz Si odaoinrzfmO p a n a B amSmaLrda ltTdnadired O l o P i nianbaadi xomonsiospr x p a o c sizixpxOo dpziApanlIa x t i r V astrimerg oann_[Crar"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 7THE GREAT WATCH-TOWER OF THE EAST, ATTRIBUTED TO AIR.

Here, beneath the presidency of the Kerubim, rule four mighty and benevolent angelsó INGM LAOC VSSN RVOI 7. Trilateral names of demons or elementals are to be formed from these 16 squares, using the two letters on either side of the upright of the cross with a letter chosen crom the Central Tablet or black cross in accordance with rules which will be given in their due place.10 Thus GM IN OC LA et cetera, form bases for these trilateral names. The following rules explain how the sides of the pyramids of which the squares are formed are attributed to the Sephiroth, Planets, Elements and Zodiacal signs.11 1. Great Central Cross. This has 36 squares, for the decantes of the Zodiac. On the left side of the Pyramid, Linea Patris has the Cardinal signs, the sign of the Element itself at the top, in the order of Tetragrammaton (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) going upwards. Linea Filii has the Common signs in the same order. Linea S.S. has the Cherubic signs, that of the element on the left, in the same order, right to left. But the order of the decans in each sign is reverse, and thus the planets which fill the right-hand side of the Pyramids go in the first two cases downwards, and in the third from left to right. The upper sides of the Pyramids are all attributed to the Element of Spirit, the lower sides to the Element of the Tablet. Each square is also referred to the small card of the Tarot which corresponds to the Decan (see 77712). "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 132. Calvary Crosses. Each has 10 squares. The upper sides of the Pyramids are uniformly given to Spirit, the lower sides to the Sephiroth, in the order shewn.13 The left-hand sides are attributed to the element of the Tablet, the right-hand sides to the sub-element of the lesser angle.14 3. Kerubic Squares. The upper sides pertain to the element of the Tablet, the lower sides to the sub-element. Right- and left-hand sides in this case correspond, according to a somewhat complex rule which it is unnecessary to give here.15 The attributions to the Court Cards of the Tarot naturally follow.16 4. Lesser Squares. The upper side of each pyramid is governed by the Kerub standing on the file above it. The lower side is governed by the Kerub also, but in order descending as the are from right to left above. [See angle of Air of Water; the Kerubs go Earth, Fire, Water, Air (from the square marked D, the fifth from the left in the top rank of the Tablet), and downward the lower sides of the squares marked O, D, E, Z go Earth, Fire, Water, Air.] The left-hand side refers to the element of the Tablet, the right-hand side to the sub-element of the lesser angle.17 5. The Black Cross or Central Tablet. The upper and lower sides are equally attributed to Spirit.

Liber Chanokh was first published in two parts as ìA Brief Abstract of the Symbolic Representation of the Universe derived by Doctor John Dee through the scrying of Sir Edward Kellyî in Equinox vol. I nos. 7-8. The second part bore an A∴A∴ Class B imprimatur on first publication. The alternate title and number (84 = ]wnj, the Hebrew name anglicised as Enoch) were given in the list of Class B publications in Equinox vol. I no. 10, where it was also stated ìIts publication is at present incomplete.î In the Blue Equinox, a continuation of Chanokh was advertised for publication in Equinox vol. III, but along with many things in that list it was never published, and quite possibly never written. The present e-text consists of the two published sections. No attempt has been made to retain pagination. All footnotes are from the Equinox publication; all endnotes by the present transcriber. Of course in some senses Liber Chanokh is redundant as there are now far better guides to both ìDee puristî and Golden Dawn Enochian magick out there; the present edition was part of a project of producing good electronic copies of the magical instructions from Equinox vol. I. Some indication of what was intended for inclusion in the unpublished parts may be had from an advertisment which appeared in Equinox I (3) promising for a future issue: ìThe Elemental Calls or Keys, with the Great Watch-Towers of the Universe. A complete treatise, fully illustrated, upon the Spirits of the Elements, their names and offices, with the method of calling them forth and controlling them. With an account of the Heptarchicall Mystery Öî It was originally intended to publish this together with The Vision and the Voice which appeared in Equinox I (5). To adequately deal with all the matters mentioned in Crowleyís ìprefatory noteî would probably take a few books. At the time Crowley was writing, the Tables of Soyga were mostly lost (eight of the tables had been copied into Sloane MS 3189) and known mainly by passing references in the Dee diaries and papers by Elias Ashmole. The ìBook of Soygaî was rediscovered by Dee scholar Deborah Harkness in 1994; copies exist in the British Library (Sloane MS 8) and the Bodleian (Bodley 908); the former is believed to be the copy owned by Dee. Besides various writings on magick this book contains 36 cryptic tables of letters. These were solved (that is, the process by which they were generated was reverse-engineered) in 1998 by Jim Reeds, a cryptographer working for AT&T Labs (see Reedsí article ìJohn Dee and the Magic Tables in the Book of Soygaî; unfortunately, since Reeds left AT&T this is no longer online). Note that these tables predate the Dee-Kelly workings, and Dee does not seem to have known what they were or what to do with them: he repeatedly asked about them and received vague or evasive answers from Kelly and/or the angels. The Heptarchic system of planetary magick is covered by Turner (1983) and James (1984); a ìGolden-Dawn-izedî version is presented by Zalewski (1990). It is set out in two MS digests by Dee, De Heptarchia Mystica in Sloane 3191, and Compendium Heptarchia Mystica (Add. MS 36,674). This material is drawn from the skrying"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 39sessions recorded in Sloane MS 3188, principally Tertius and Quartus but incorporating material from all the books. It is not clear whether what Dee meant by the ìBook of Enochî was the ìTablets of Enochî which are definitely identical with the tablets composing the Great Table (Table of Watchtowers), or Liber Logaeth, though the latter seems to be the favoured interpretation. Logaeth survives in BL Sloane MS 3189, Liber Mysteriorum Sextus et Sanctus, in Edward Kellyís handwriting. This copy has the title ìThe Book of Enoch, revealed to Dr. John Dee by the Angelsî, interpolated by Elias Ashmole. To the best of my knowledge nobody has deciphered Logaeth to date. Thomas Head (in Regardie (ed.), 1984) claimed to have been able to solve some of the tables and tentatively translate some of the material in the ìAngelic languageî contained in the book; he did not give further details and as far as I am aware has not published his findings. Some researchers (e.g. Laycock, 1978) are of the opinion that the material recorded in Logaeth may be a glossolalia. It appears that some unacknowledged work in the compilation of the published parts of Chanokh was done by James Windram, Crowleyís South African lieutenant; and that Crowley later attempted to palm off the work of writing the continuation onto him, but without result. Correspondence relating to this was recently (2003) published in the O.T.O. internal magazine The Magical Link. The first part of Chanokh was reprinted as The Symbolic Representation of the Universe by Unicorn Press of Seattle in the 1970s. Both published parts were included in the compilation Gems from the Equinox edited by F.I. Regardie, the plates vilely reproduced and the number of the work erroneously given as LXXXIX, under which number it has occasionally been cited by later writers. I have adapted as a convenience Regardieís interpolation of ìThe Symbolic Representation of the Universeî as a sub-title for the first part. It was again reprinted in Enochian World of Aleister Crowley (Enochian Sex Magick) by C.S. Hyatt and Lon Milo DuQuette (New Falcon: 1991). The present key entry was made from a facsimile of Equinox I (7-8). The Holy Table, Ensigns of Creation, and Sigillum Dei ∆meth were redrawn based on material in Ben Roweís Enochian Magic Reference and Clay Holdenís PDFs of Mysteriorum Liber Secundus and Mysteriorum Liber Tertius. The general view of the Great Table was entered from the version in the Equinox; the views of the Watchtowers and Tablet of Union as pyramid squares were redrawn, the letters checked against Plate III and the symbols checked according to the Golden Dawn rules printed in Regardie (ed.), The Golden Dawn. The version of the ìEnochianî alphabet used in Plates IV-IX is the NI EnochianA typeface constructed by the present editor, closely based on the final forms of the letters from Quinti Libri Mysteriorum Appendix, as printed by Laycock (1978). Plate X has been redrawn and corrects a few minor errors (omission of some numbers and direction markers). As regards the text I have only corrected what seemed to me to be obvious typographical errors (the only significant ones being three in the table of ∆thyrs, all discussed in endnotes); other doubtful readings have been left intact and remarked on in endnotes. I would like to thank Frater o.b. for technical advice, however I take full responsibility for any errors in the above or in the following notes. Love is the law, love under will.

"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"NOTES 42 Notes to Part I 1: These talismans, the Ensigns of Creation, are referred to the seven planets (clockwise from top) Venus, Sol, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Luna. The details of the ensigns are not visible on the graphic of the Holy Table (Plate I). The seven ensigns and an account of their reception can be found in Mysteriorum Liber Tertius; they are reproduced in Turner (1989). 2: The letters on the Holy Table itself are derived from the names of the Heptarchic Kings and Princes. The method is described in Deeís Libri Mysteriorum Quinti Appendix and in various secondary sources such as Turnerís notes to De Heptarchia Mystica, Ben Roweís Enochian Magic Reference and Zalewski (1990). Most printed editions reverse the arrangement of the letters left to right from the design described in the Dee diaries, following the version printed in TFR (most likely the result of an engraverís error). Since in Chanokh Crowley simply reproduced the plate of the table from Casaubon and did not treat of it in detail, I have seen fit to reconstruct the figure. Note though that in Crowleyís vision of the 15th ∆thyr in The Vision and the Voice the ìHoly Twelvefold Table of OITî was probably conceived according to the Casaubon printing, i.e. reading O I T R L U L R L O O E so the names OIT, RLU and OOE (LRL is palindromic) mentioned in that vision would be read left to right on the table as printed in Casaubon and the Equinox, but right to left on the table reconstructed from the angelsí directions (there is evidence in the Dee MSS that ìEnochianî should be written right to left). 3: A full account of the reception of the Sigillum Dei Æmeth is contained in Mysteriorum Liber Secundus. The plate of the seal has been redrawn based on the account in Secundus and on Clay Holdenís reconstruction: the rendition in the Equinox printing, which has been much reproduced, contained a number of errors. 4: That is, four others similar in design; they were to be encased in ìhollow things, of Sweet Woodî mounted on the end of each table leg. The size does not appear to be specified in those sections of the Dee diaries I have been able to consult (Primus through to Tertius plus TFR), but those made by Dee are still extant and are 5 inches in diameter. 5: Most of these names consist of a transliteration of the Hebrew for the ìSphere of the Planetî with ì-elî stuck on the end. See Agrippa De occulta philosophia lib. III cap. XXVIII, where most of these names appear: ìÖ the spirit of Saturn is called Sabathiel; the spirit of Jupiter Zedekiel; the spirit of Mars, Madimiel; the spirit of the Sun Semeliel, or Semeschia; the spirit of Venus Nogahel; the spirit of Mercury Cochabiah, or Cochabiel; the spirit of the Moon, Jareahel, or Levanael.î A Corabiel is cited as one of the ìAngels of the First Heaven ruling Mondayî in the Heptameron of pseudo-Abano, but there has no particular connection to Mercury. Crowley omits to mention the names formed from the letters written along the outer heptagon; the ìSeven Angels which stand in the presence of Godî mentioned by Agrippa (De occ. phil., tom. II cap. X). These should be arranged, thus:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 43 Zl l RH i aa ZCa a c bp a u p n h rhdmh i a i k k a a e e ei i e e l l l e e l l M G+then reading down columns we get ZAPHKIEL, ZADKIEL, CUMAEL, RAPHAEL, HANIEL, MICHAEL, GABRIEL for the seven classical planets, with the final + signifying the Earth. 6: While there does indeed appear in TFR (p. 179) an arrangement of the letters from the black cross as a five by four table, this appears to have been a convenience adopted during the communication of the Great Table (Table of Watchtowers); as the letters were immediately afterwards written into the cross between the four tablets, described as the ìcrosse of union, or black crossî (ibid., p. 180). The importance it assumed in the Golden Dawn appears to derive from an intermediate source, possibly Sloane MS 307, an edited extract from which became ëHí, Clavicula Tabularum Enochii. 7: It is stated (see, e.g. the working of 26th June 1584, TFR p. 180) that this name and the following should be reversed to call forth and compel the kakodaimons (the three-letter names). 8: Examples in this and the two following are taken from the C of C lesser angle. 9: I have transcribed this table directly from the Equinox version. It does not appear to follow directly any of the versions of the Great Table in the Dee MSS; that is, some letters match the 1584 Great Table as delivered by AvÈ, some match the 1587 version as reformed by Raphael, and some disagree with both these but agree with the Great Table that can be constructed from the names of the ìParts of the Earth as imposed by Godî of Liber Scientiæ communicated by Nalvage, using their characters on the Table of Watchtowers (Dee noticed the discrepency between the latter two at the time: in the working of 2nd June 1584, a week after the original delivery of the Great Table (TFR p. 188), Dee asked Ave ìAs concerning the diversity of certain words in these Tables and those of the portions of the Earth delivered by Nalvage, what say you?î and was told simply ìThe Tables be true.î). Possibly it follows a Golden Dawn ìcorrectionî of the Tablets. 10: The rules for prefixing black cross letters to names drawn from the Kerubic and Servient squares are nowhere stated in Chanokh. The rule apparently used by Dee (vide the lists of names in the ìBook of Supplications and Invocationsî in Sloane MS. 3191) was to use the black cross letter on the same row of the general view of the tablets as the name you were working with; thus only the letters E, X, A, R, P, H, C, O, M, A were thus used. These were used to (a) generate Divine Names ruling the angels of the four squares above the bar of the cross in each lesser angle, and (b) generate the names of kakodaimons from pairs of letters below the bar of the cross. The Golden Dawn rule, per contra (apparently deriving from Sloane 307), was to refer one of the four lines of the ìTablet of Unionî to each Watchtower; thus EXARP to Air, HCOMA to Water, NANTA to Earth and BITOM to Fire. The first letter of each row was prefixed to names drawn from the Kerubic squares of each lesser angle, the second to names drawn from Servient squares of the Lesser Angle"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"NOTES 44 of Air, the third to names drawn from the Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Water, the fourth to names drawn from the Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Earth, and the fifth to names drawn from the Servient squares of the Lesser Angle of Fire. As Crowley gives no examples it is not clear which system he intended. 11: The following is all derived from Golden Dawn teaching rather than the Dee manuscripts. 12: Columns CXXXIII to CXXXVI. 13: More precisely, each square is referred to the Sephirah modified by the element of the Lesser Angle; or to that Sephirah in the Qabalistic world corresponding (thus Fire ñ Atziluth, Water ñ Briah, etc.). Regardie gives the positions of Binah through to Geburah differently; Zalewski (1990) gives the same reading as Chanokh, stating this arrangement appears in Westcottís Notanda to the G.D. Enochian papers. 14: In addition the upper six are referred to the Planets according to the scheme in 777 col. CXXIV, ìThe Heavenly Hexagram,î and to the Tarot Trumps corresponding. 15: See Regardie (ed.), The Golden Dawn, vol. IV. 16: Suit by element of lesser angle, rank by element of column; so in the Lesser Angles of Water, the square with the left and right sides referred to Fire is attributed to the Knight of Cups. 17: Each square is additionally referred to one of the 16 figures of Geomancy, and to one of the Signs or Elements (Saturn replacing Earth as per the dual attribution of the Path of Tau), and thence to the Hebrew letter and Tarot card corresponding: thus Row Column Attributions Fire a Puer h IV ñ The Emperor Water d Populus j VII ñ The Chariot Air g Puella l VIII ñ Justice Fire (Cardinal signs) Earth j Carcer o XV ñ The Devil Fire e Fortuna Minor f XI ñ Strength Water h Rubeus n XIII ñ Death Air k Tristesia x XVII ñ The Star Water (Fixed signs) Earth b Amissio w V ñ The Hierophant Fire i Acquisitio s XIV ñ Temperence Water l Laetitia q XVIII ñ The Moon Air c Albus z VI ñ The Lovers Air (Mutable signs) Earth f Conjunctio y IX ñ The Hermit Fire B Cauda Draconis c XX ñ The Last JudgementWater C Via m XII ñ The Hanged Man Air D Fortuna Minor a 0 ñ The Fool Earth (Elements) Earth ' (E) Caput Draconis t XXI ñ The Universe (If using the Book of Thoth attributions, exchange h and x and change titles of Tarot Trumps accordingly.

Most"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 45 ìEnochianî typefaces generally used do not reflect this; this is unfortunate, since Deeís angels insisted strongly on the correct orthography of the letters. 19: See in particular the Book of Enoch; though at the time of the Dee-Kelly workings this was known only by reputation in Europe. The name ìEnochianî for the alphabet and language is modern; for Dee it was the ìAngelicî or ìAdamicalî alphabet and language. 20: In Liber Scientiæ this column is headed ìParts of the Earth as imposed by God.î Crowleyís gloss is based on the statement in True Relation (spelling modernised) that the Call of the Thirty Aires summons the ì91 Princes and spiritual Governers, unto whom the earth is delivered as a portion. They bring in and depose Kings and all the governments upon the Earth, and vary the nature of things with the variation of every moment; Unto whom the providence of Eternal Judgment is already opened. These are generally governed by the 12 angels of the 12 tribes, which are also governed by the 7 who stand before the presence of God.î (TFR p.139-140; working of 21st May 1584). A passage in Latin immediately following appears to indicate that it is the Angels of the 12 Tribes who are the governers of the 91 parts, some having many, some fewer, under their rule (ìPer tota terra distributa sub 12 Principibus Angelis, 12 Tribuum Israel: quorum 12 aliqui plures, aliqui pauciores partes habent sub sua regimine ex 91 partibus in quas tota terra hic demonstratur esse divisa.î), suggesting that the seven-letter names in this column are the names of the Parts themselves rather than denoting discrete angelic entities associated with the Parts. The names of the 91 Parts were delivered on the 21st and 22nd of May 1584 (TFR pp. 141-5, 148-152). The Equinox publication omitted the numbers of the 91 Parts; however as these numbers are used to identify their characters on the Table of Watchtowers (Plate X) they have been restored. The Angels of the Tribes are as follows : Angel Tribe Quarter OLPAGED Dan East GEBABAL Asshur East S-E LAVAVOTH Gad South S-E ZIRACAH Reuben South ZURCHOL Simeon South S-W ZINGGEN Zebulon West S-W HONONOL Judah West ALPUDUS Issachar West N-W ARFAOLG Ephraim North N-W ZARNAAH Manesseh North CADAAMP Benjamin North N-E ZARZILG Napthali East N-E James (1984) gives a set of attributions of these to the signs of the Zodiac which results in a rather strange arrangement of the signs around the circle of the quarters; as I am not sure what his source for it was, it is here omitted. Another arrangement appears in Zalewski (1990), based on some notes by Mathers to a Golden Dawn lecture on the astrological attributions of the 12 Tribes, but this appears to disregard Deeís attribution of Angels to Tribes &c.; it is thus also omitted. Turner (1989) argues that the column ìquartersî (4 plagi mundi tribibus dispersis"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"NOTES 46 assignatæ) refers to the arrangement of the tribes around the square wall of the symbolic plan of Jerusalem; this is supported by a diagram in Sloane 3191 (following the table of Ayres) titled ìOrdo Dispersi IsraÎlis, hac Êtate 1585î; thus ìNorth N-Wî refers to the Western side of the North wall, ìNorthî to the centre of the North wall, ìNorth N-Eî to the Eastern side of the North wall, and so forth. 21: The characters associated with this name in the table of Ayres and the figure of characters on the Great Table in Sloane 3191 differ slightly; both are ambiguous as neither can be traced in a single continuous stroke without doubling-back; however there does not appear to be any way to read OCCODON using the former character on either the Ave or Raphael Great Table versions. 22: This reading agrees with Sloane 3191, TFR and Turnerís typeset of Liber Scientiæ (James has DIALIOAI which is blatantly wrong at it has one letter too many); the character on the Great Table will read DIALOIA on the 1584 and 1587 tables (or the version in Chanokh). The matter is complicated by the fact that in Sloane 3191 the character on the Great Table differs from the character given with this name in the table of Ayres in Liber Scientiæ which will give DIALIOA from the Ave or Raphael Great Table. 23: Thus in Equinox publication, and in Jamesís and Turnerís typesets of Liber Scientiæ.

From this and the other instances above (VIROCHI / VIROOLI, ABAIOND / ABRIOND, etc.) we might conclude that the letters written in under the names of the Parts in the table in Liber Scientiæ were not necessarily ëcorrections,í simply Dee noting specific discrepancies between the Great Table as delivered by Ave and that reconstructed from the names of the 91 Parts and their characters as delivered by Nalvage. In most cases James and Turner appear to have treated them as if they were corrections and thus given the amended reading, consistent with the Great Table as delivered by Ave, rather than the name as given by Nalvage; Crowley (or Windram) also appears to have assumed a ëcorrectioní in a number of cases. 33: The Equinox publication had ORPAMB, as does Turner; this is possibly from a misreading of Sloane 3191 but is blatantly erroneous as it has the wrong number of letters, and in any case the ëií is clearly dotted; it has thus been corrected to the reading in Liber Scientiæ which matches Plate III and the Ave Great Table; the Raphael Great Table gives CRPANIB. 34: The Equinox publication had TAONGLA which has been changed as a typo: in this instance it is not plausible as a misreading of Sloane 3191. The reading given is from Liber Scientiæ and is consistent with the Ave Great Table. Plate III gives TAAOGLA, and the Raphael Great Table gives TAAOGBA. 35: Thus in Equinox publication; this reading is consistent with the table in Plate III and as far as I can tell is what is actually written in Sloane 3191 (James has DOXINAL, Turner has DAZINAL, Casaubon has DOZINAL). Both the Ave and Raphael versions of the Great Table give DOXMAEL. 36: More normally given as THAHEBYOBEAATANUN (some of the vowels are interpolations to make it pronouncable; the name as initially constructed ñ see note below ñ is ThHBYBAATNN). 37: These names are derived by the Golden Dawn from the perimeter of the Sigillum Dei ∆meth by an excruciatingly complex process using various rules of counting, then interpolating additional vowels, in many cases more than strictly necessary to make the names pronouncable. As far as I am aware these ìSupreme Elemental Kingsî (or ìAngel Overseersî) are nowhere mentioned in the Dee MSS, although the characters referred to them by the G.D. do appear in the Dee material, associated with the Watchtowers (the G.D. elaborated the characters somewhat and rendered them in ëflashing coloursí). One of the names, THAAOTH (became THAHAAOTAHE) appears in Secundus, since in that instance the G.D. used Deeís rule of counting which gives a total of seven names from the perimeter, one starting from each of the capitalised letters (with the exception that starting from 11/A and 6/A give the same name), although Dee was then told to strike the duplicated ëAí, giving THAOTH. TAHOELOG is obtained starting from 4/T and counting clockwise by 4 (for the 4 flames above the T in the character) regardless of the number in the space, giving THAOLOG; OHOOOHATAN starting from 6/ω counting clockwise by 12 (for the 12 rays in the character) giving OHOOOHATN; THAHEBYOBEAATANUN by a convoluted and seemingly arbitrary rule: starting at 4/T for the cross in the character, taken as a Tau; count 4 to 22/h; then put in the ëbí from the 4/b in the character rather than the perimeter of the sigil; then jump to the y/15 which is in position 22 on the perimeter (counting clockwise from 4/T as 1); then count 4 to 10/b, then from the b/6 in the character count by 6 to 6/A, a/5, t/9, 14/n, n for THBYBAATNN. 38: The numbers identifying sigils are a modern interpolation; they are not in Sloane"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"NOTES 48 3191, although as each character is unique (taking orientation into account), they can be identified by comparison with the characters as given in the table of Ayres in Liber Scientiæ (as noted, two differ slightly). The bar across the start of each sigil marks the start point; the arrowhead the finish point. In some of the characters some doubling-back is necessary. Character 59 is drawn making the first stroke top left to bottom right, the second left to right, and the third bottom to top. The character numbered 65 forms the name of LAXDIZI who is not mentioned in Liber Scientiæ; according to Turner (1989) this character is the sigil of PARAOAN, 65; no character is given for part 65 in Sloane 3191. Notes to Part II 1: The attribution of the first eighteen Calls to the Tablets is either a Golden Dawn innovation or derives from an intermediate source; it is not in the Dee material. 2: This from G.D. pronunciation rules. AC has also adopted, without mentioning it, other elements of these rules: z is always pronounced extended as ëzodí or ëzodaí; g is pronounced either hard or soft; i may be pronounced as a vowel, ëií, or a consonantal ëyí. c is generally pronounced hard, although in some of the calls it is transliterated as Á in which case it is pronounced soft. An alternative discussion of Enochian pronunciation issues may be found in Laycock (1978). 3: This ritual fragment is abbreviated from the opening of the Portal grade (attributed to Spirit) in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Similarly the rituals preceding the Third through Sixth Keys are abbreviated versions of the appropriate Elemental Grade openings. 4: The following text of the Keys or Calls is a phonetic rendition, inserting vowels where necessary according to the G.D. pronunciation rules. Note that final ëeís are pronounced separately. The English translations have been slightly modified from those in the Dee MSS., in addition to the modernisation of spelling. 5: Thus in Equinox printing; in the Dee MSS and most other printed editions the word vonpho (vonupeho), ìwrathî appears at this point. This omission may derive from an error by Crowley when copying the Calls from G.D. MSS., since it appears that in his Enochian versions of the conjurations in the Goetia (ca. 1903) he glosses calz (caelazod) as ëfirmament of wrathí rather than simply ëfirmament.í 6: All other printed sources I have been able to consult (except those deriving from Chanokh) give loholo. The sobolo reading probably derives from a careless reading of Sloane 3191, mistaking the initial ëlí for a narrow ësí and the ëhí for an incomplete ëb.í 7: Vooan was originally received, here and in the Third Key, but Dee was informed at the time by Nalvage that: ìVooan is spoken with them that fall, but Vaoan with them that are, and are glorified. The devils have lost the dignity of the sounds.î Nalvage may well have been using ëwithí to mean ëbyí or ëamongí rather than ëwhen addressing.í In Sloane 3191, Vooan is written with an a above the first o. 8: A doubtful modernisation; Sloane 3191 has ìa strong Seething.î 9: In Sloane 3191, avavago is glossed simply ìthe thundersî in the Eighth Key; but in the Fourth Key it is glossed ìthunders of increaseî (as opposed to Coraxo, ìthe thunders of judgement and wrathî in the Tenth Key). 10: The translation in the footnote is more plausible. ozol (ozodola in the phonetic rendition) is likely to be a compound of zol, glossed ìhandsî in the First Key (it is glossed ìtheir hedsî in Sloane 3191, although in the line above the same gloss is"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"LIBER LXXXIV 49 given for Dazis). collal (colalala) is not elsewhere attested, but is glossed ìsleuesî in Sloane 3191. 11: Much confusion in this passage. In Sloane 3191 the translation of vohim ol gizyax od eors (ìwith a hundred mighty erthquakes and a thowsand times as manyî [the last three words repeat the intralineal translation of cocasg plosi]) is in the margin rather than intralinearly. I am not sure of the source for the ëechoingí gloss; matorb is untranslated in Sloane 3191. 12: There is an apparent lacuna in the Enochian: the translation has English words with no corresponding Angelic (see note below). A tentative suggestion (Tyson, 1998) is od aldon od noas (od aladonu od noasa). 13: In Sloane 3191 appears a cross after ìNiisoî with a corresponding note in the margin apparently reading, ìHere lacketh, and they gathered themselues together and became.î The reading in Chanokh is erroneous; the missing words clearly go before ìsalman telochî (ìthe House of Deathî). 14: sic., should be ìreign.î dasonuf (dsonf) is a contraction of ds (which) and sonf (reign). Sloane 3191 has ìrayngî both here and for sonf in the First Key. 15: ìbe friendly unto meî inadvertently omitted at this point; but the closing formula of Keys 13-18 is identical in the originals; that is, Dee was simply told to repeat the same formula. 16: See TFR p. 199-200 (working of 11th July, 1584). Compare also this statement by Nalvage prior to the delivery of the Calls (spelling as in TFR): ìI am therefore to instruct and inform you, according to your Doctrine delivered, which is contained in 49 Tables. In 49 voyces, or callings: which are the Natural Keyes to open these, not 49 but 48 (for One is not to be opened) Gates of Understanding, whereby you shall have knowledge to move every Gate, and to call out as many as you please, or shall be thought necessary Öî (working of 12th April 1584, TFR p. 177). 17: Disregard Crowleyís footnote. There is no indication in the digests or in TFR that this name should be varied according to the Aire being invoked, and there is no particular connection between the name IDOIGO, which appears on the vertical bar of the cross in the Air of Air sub-quadrant, and the First Aire; the names of the Parts contained in the First Aire are all drawn from the Water Tablet. There was some confusion in the communication of this name, it was initially gives as IDUIGO but corrected shortly afterwards. 18: Most other printed versions of the Calls give moooah here (the final ëeí is just a product of Crowleyís phonetic rendering). Probably another instance of someone reading one of Deeís lowercase ëhís as an incomplete ëbí (see note above re sobolo / loholo in the First Key). 19: A variant translation of this Call appears in The Vision and the Voice, Second ∆thyr: this includes a few glosses by Crowley as well as some reinterpretations of a couple of phrases (e.g., orsba od dodrmni zylna, ìdrunken and vexed in itselfî is rendered ìecstasy and irritation of orgasmî and Moooah ol cordziz, glossed ìit repenteth me that I made manî by Kelly, is interpreted ìit rejoiceth me concerning the Virgin and Manî). 20: These names are presumably an innovation by either the Golden Dawn or Crowley; Turner (1989) states that no indication of any such thing is found in any of the Dee material. They are generated by a process effectively reversing that used to derive the Shem ha-Mephorash or Divided Name of God; that is, the first name is created by taking the first letter from each of the names of the Aires in order, inserting vowels rules to make it pronouncable; similarly for the second and third."}]
