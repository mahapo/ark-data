The Temple being in darkness, and the Speaker ascended into his place, let him begin by a ritual of the Enterer, as followeth. 1. w Procul, O procul este profani. 2. Bahlasti! Ompehda! 3. In the name of the Mighty and Terrible One, I proclaim that I have banished the Shells unto their habitations. 4. I invoke Tahuti, the Lord of Wisdom and of Utterance, the God that cometh forth from the Veil. 5. O Thou! Majesty of Godhead! Wisdom-crowned Tahuti! Lord of the Gates of the Universe! Thee, Thee, I invoke! O Thou of the Ibis Head! Thee, Thee I invoke. Thou who wieldest the Wand of Double Power! Thee, Thee I invoke! Thou who bearest in Thy left hand the Rose and Cross of Light and Life: Thee, Thee I invoke. Thou, whose head is as an emerald, and Thy nemmes as the night-sky blue! Thee, Thee I invoke. Thou, whose skin is of flaming orange as though it burned in a furnace! Thee, Thee I invoke. 6. Behold! I am Yesterday, To-Day, and the Brother of To-Morrow! I am born again and again. Mine is the Unseen Force, whereof the gods are sprung!

Who keep watch over the Universe! Ye who company the Bier to the House of Rest! Who pilot the Ship of Ra advancing onwards to the heights of heaven! Lord of the Shrine which standeth in the Centre of the Earth! 8. Behold, He is in me, and I in Him! Mine is the Radiance, wherein Ptah floateth over the firmament! I travel upon high! I tread upon the firmament of Nu! I raise a flashing flame, with the lightning of Mine Eye! Ever rushing on, in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra: giving my life to the Dwellers of Earth. 9. If I say “Come up upon the mountains!” the Celestial Waters shall flow at my Word. For I am Ra incarnate! Khephra created in the Flesh! I am the Eidolon of my father Tmu, Lord of the City of the Sun! 10. The God who commands is in my mouth! The God of Wisdom is in my Heart! My tongue is the Sanctuary of Truth! And a God sitteth upon my lips. 11. My Word is accomplished every day! And the desire of my heart realises itself, as that of Ptah when He createth!
