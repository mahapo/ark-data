This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the most minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have done in its preparation. 2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things that may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things, certain results will follow; students are earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philo-sophical validity to any of them. 3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these: (a) A widening of the horizon of the mind. (b) An improvement of the control of the mind. 4. The student, if he attain to success in the following practices, will find himself confronted by things (ideas or beings) too glorious or too dreadful to be described. It is essential that he remain the master of all that he beholds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion, and the prey of madness. Before entering upon any of these practices, the student should be in good health, and have attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama, and Dharana.1 5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fail to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, obsessed and overwhelmed by his results, even though it be by those which it is necessary that he should attain. Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well begun."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"LIBER O 2 It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result the importance which it at first seems to possess. 6. First, then, let us consider the Book 777 and its use; the preparation of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally the methods which follow in Chapter V. ìViator in Regnis Arboris,î* and in Chapter VI. ìSagitta trans Lunam.îÜ (In another book will it be treated of the Expansion and Contraction of Consciousness; progress by slaying the Cakkr‚ms; progress by slaying the Pairs of Opposites; the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, &c. &c.2) II 1. The student must FIRST obtain a thorough knowledge of Book 777, especially of columns i., ii., iii., v., vi., vii., ix., xi., xii., xiv., xv., xvi., xvii., xviii., xix., xxxiv., xxxv., xxxviii., xxxix., xl., xli., xlii., xlv., liv., lv., lix., lx., lxi., lxiii., lxx., lxxv., lxxvii., lxxviii., lxxix., lxxx., lxxxi., lxxxiii., xcvii., xcviii., xcix., c., ci., cxvii., cxviii., cxxxvii., cxxxviii., cxxxix., clxxv., clxxvi., clxxvii., clxxxii.3 When these are committed to memory, he will begin to understand the nature of these correspondences.

Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure science. In column xlv., line 12, you will find ìKnowledge of Sciences.î By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that the Planet corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its   * [Lat. ìThe traveller in the Kingdoms of the Tree (scil. of Life).î] Ü [Lat. ìThe arrow beyond the Moonî (the reference being to the path of Samekh on the Kircher Tree).]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"VEL MANVS ET SAGITT∆ 3 lineal figures the octagon and octagram, the God who rules that planet Thoth, or in Hebrew symbolism Tetragram-maton Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael, its Choir of Angels Beni Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit Taphtatharath, its colours Orange (for Mercury is the sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8), Yellow, Purple, Grey, and Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfumes Mastic and others, its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal or Agate, its sacred animal the Snake, &c. &c. 3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accord-ing. In an orange circle you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you would place eight lamps. The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found in Cornelius Agrippa4 and other books) you would draw in the four colours with such other devices as your experiences may suggest. 4. And so on. We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary preparations; and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper books, of which the ìGoetiaî is perhaps the best example. These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary the student should do nothing the object of which he does not understand; also, if he have any capacity whatever, he will find his own crude rituals more effective than the highly polished ones of other people. The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows: 5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be his wish to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about him directly suggest that idea. Thus in the ritual quoted, if his glance fall upon the lights, their number suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and again Mercury is brought to his mind. In other words, the whole magical apparatus and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics.

As to possibility of producing results external to the mind of the seer (objective, in the ordinary common-sense acceptation of the term) we are here silent.] 6. There are three important practices connected with all forms of ceremonial (and the two Methods which later we shall describe). These are: (1) Assumption of God-forms. (2) Vibrations of Divine Names. (3) Rituals of ìBanishingî and ìInvoking.î These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous Methods of Chapters V. and VI. are attempted. III 1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt5 should be made thoroughly familiar. This can be done by studying them in any public museum, or in such books as may be accessible to the student.6 They should then be carefully painted by him, both from the model and from memory. 2. The student, seated in the ìGodî position, or in the characteristic attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His image as coinciding with his own body, or as enveloping it. This must be practiced until mastery of the image is attained, and an identity with it and with the God experienced. It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain tests of success in this practice exist. 3. The vibration of God-names. As a further means of identifying the human consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the name of some God, let him act thus: 4. (a) Stand with arms outstretched. (See Illustration).7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"VEL MANVS ET SAGITT∆ 5 (b) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of the God desired entering with the breath. (c) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the solar plexus, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet. (d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance the left foot about twelve inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn back to the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical position of the God Horus,* and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing up through the body, while you breathe it out through the nostrils with the air which has been till then retained in the lungs. All this must be done with all the force of which you are capable. (e) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger, so that you are in the characteristic position of the God Harpocrates.Ü 5. It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a single ìVibrationî entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should cause him to grow hot all over, or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken him that he will find it difficult to remain standing. 6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it perceived, when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself. In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but the God-form and name should be absolutely blotted out; and the longer it takes for normal perception to return, the better.   * See Illustration in Equinox Vol. I.

These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn appear in flame, in flame so near to physical flame that it would perhaps be visible to the eyes of a bystander, were one present. It is alleged that some persons have attained the power of actually kindling fire by these means. Whether this be so or not, the power is not one to be aimed at. 3. Success in ìbanishingî is known by a ìfeeling of cleanlinessî in the atmosphere; success in ìinvokingî by a ìfeeling of holiness.î It is unfortunate that these terms are so vague. But at least make sure of this: that any imaginary figure or being shall instantly obey the will of the student, when he uses the appropriate figure. In obstinate cases, the form of the appropriate God may be assumed. 4. The banishing rituals should be used at the commence-ment of any ceremony whatever. Next, the student should use a general invocation, such as the ìPreliminary Invocationî in the ìGoetia,î as well as a special invocation to suit the nature of his working. 5.

Practice will make the student infinitely wary in these matters. 11. It is usually quite easy to return to the body; but should any difficulty arise, practice (again) will make the imagination fertile. For example, one may create in thought a chariot of fire with white horses, and command the charioteer to drive earthwards. It might be dangerous to go too far, or stay too long, for fatigue must be avoided. The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or loss of memory or other mental faculty. 12. Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which he supposes himself to have been travelling to coincide with the physical, tightening his muscles, drawing in his breath, and putting his forefinger to his lips. Then let him ìawakeî by a well-defined act of will, and soberly and accurately record his experiences. It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is perfectly easy to perform. It is best to learn by ìtravellingî with a person already experienced in the matter. Two or three experi-ments should suffice to render the student confident and even expert.

But it is susceptible of a develop-ment which merges into a form of Dharanaóconcentrationóand as such may lead to the very highest ends. The principal use of the practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the student with every kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may be perfect master of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it, to cause it instantly to obey his will."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"LIBER O 16 2.

Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a line exactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his physical body is situated (or, to put it more simply, straight upwards). 4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost overcomes him. If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do so, and that figure appear, let him at all costs rise above them.

The edition of the English translation edited by Donald Tyson (St. Paul, Minnestoa: Llewellyn, 1993) has an appendix explaining how these characters are derived. 5 The reason for using the Egyptian forms is simply that they have the best-defined Magical Images. There are also techniques for deriving Magical Images from names in Hebrew or Greek, which can be applied to this practice as well as in the construction of Telesmatic Images. You should also find out about forms from any other pantheons which particularly appeal to you. 6 See for example Budgeís Gods of the Egyptians. 7 A footnote by Crowley at this point in the Magick in Theory and Practice version of Liber O reads: ìThis injunction does not apply to gods like Ptah or Harpocrates whose natures do not accord with this gesture.î 8 This represents the G.D. practice, derived from Levi; there are variations around this point. 9 A more usual practice is to begin facing East; if using the ritual to banish or clear a space, at this point advance to the East edge of your circle, and make the remaining pentagrams at the other cardinal points of the circle, returning to the centre for points x. ñ xxi. 10 Some practitioners prefer to vibrate IHVH ìspelt outî i.e. as YOD HEH VAU HEH."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"VEL MANVS ET SAGITT∆ 19 11 You should turn back to the East thus completing the circle before doing this. 12 This is generally interpreted as: the Active Equilibrating pentagram with the name AHIH and the sign of Rending the Veil to be given before the pentagram of Air or Fire, the Passive Equilibrating pentagram with the name AGLA and the sign of Closing the Veil to be given before the pentagram of Earth or Water. The G.D. Ritual of the Pentagram (as printed by Regardie) states that ìthe saluting sign of the 5∞=6∞ Gradeî rather than the Portal signs should be used with the Spirit Pentagrams. This probably refers to the Sign of Osiris Slain but I am not totally sure about this. The G.D. also taught a ìSupreme Ritual of the Pentragramî the routine for which in each quarter runs as follows: make appropriate Spirit pentagram while vibrating the Tablet of Union name (EXARP, BITOM, HCOMA, NANTA) corresponding to the quarter; trace wheel of Spirit symbol in centre while vibrating AHIH (actives) or AGLA (passives); give Spirit sign; trace Elemental pentagram while vibrating the 12-letter name from the appropriate Elemental Tablet (ORO IBAH AOZPI, etc. ñ see Liber Chanokh); trace Kerubic symbol while vibrating the Hebrew name; give Elemental sign. 13 The hexagrams shown in this part are all the invoking form. To make the banishing forms, trace the triangles in the same order and starting from the same point, but trace each triangle in the opposite direction. 14 See 777, col. v. Generally for the Planets use the name for the Sephirah corresponding, and for the Signs, the name of the Sephirah corresponding to the ruling Planet. In the version taught in the Golden Dawn, the letters of ARARITA were attributed to the points of the Hexagram in ìlightning flashî order (A to Saturn, R to Jupiter, A to Mars, etc.) and the particular letter was to be vibrated along with the other names. 15 The Hexagram of Sol is formed by tracing the hexagrams of the other six planets in order, thus twelve triangles in total. In the diagram, numbers are placed by the starting point of the first stroke."}]
