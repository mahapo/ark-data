In the East, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which is situated on the south-eastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland, two miles east of Foyers, is a shrine or High Altar. Its dimensions should be 7 feet in length, 3 feet in breadth, 44 inches in height. It should be covered with a crimson altar-cloth, on which may be embroidered fleur-de-lys in gold, or a sunblaze, or other suitable emblem. On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk, with counterchanges in black and white. Below it should be the dais of three steps, in black and white squares. Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the StËle of Revealing in reproduction with four candles on each side of it. Below the stËle is a place for The Book of the Law; with six candles on each side of it. Below this again is the Holy Graal, with roses on each side of it. There is room in front of the Cup for the Paten. On each side beyond the roses are two great candles. All this is enclosed within a great veil. 1 This ritual was written by Crowley about 1913, and revised in 1916. A German translation with some alterations was published by Theodor Reuss through the O.T.O. in 1917. First English-language publication in The International (New York), March 1918, where it was spuriously described as ìedited from the Ancient Documents in Assyrian and Greek by The Master Therion.î Published again in The Equinox vol. III no. 1 (Detroit, 1919) and again in Magick in Theory and Practice. There are minor variations between all these publications. The present text for the most part follows the rescension in the 1994 ìBlue Brickî edition of Magick (Weiser) but one obvious error in that printing has been corrected. Stage directions have been rubricated for ease of comprehension.

Compare Crowleyís idiosyncratic use of the word ìchastity.î The editor of the 1994 Blue Brick stated that there was no such note in any annotated copy used in preparing that edition (but also that at least one copy from which Gerald Yorke had transcribed MS. notes by Crowley was believed to exist but was not available for consultation). In any case the citation point for the ìsworn whoreî remark should probably actually be ìspecially dedicated to the service of the Great Order.î"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ECCLESI∆ GNOSTIC∆ CATHOLIC∆ CANON MISS∆ 3III. Of the Ceremony of the Introit. The DEACON, opening the door of the Temple, admits the Congregation, and takes his stand between the small altar and the font. (There should be a door-keeper to attend to the admission.) The DEACON advances and bows before the open shrine where the Graal is exalted. He kisses The Book of the Law three times, opens it, and places it upon the super-altar. He turns West. The DEACON: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I proclaim the Law of Life, Light, Love and Liberty in the name of ΙΑΩ. The CONGREGATION: Love is the law, love under will. The DEACON goes to his place between the altar of incense and the font, faces East and gives the step and sign of a Man and a Brother. All imitate him.4 The DEACON and all the PEOPLE: I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes. And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all; and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name BABALON. And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET. And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love and Liberty, the Word of whose Law is ΘΕΛΗΜΑ. And I believe in the communion of Saints. And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass. 4 In any performances where members of the general public, or O.T.O. members below III∞, are present, the old versions of the O.T.O. I∞ to III∞ signs and steps are employed. These are nigh-identical to those of English Craft Freemasonry. The step of a Man and Brother (Entered Apprentice) stand erect, feet square: left foot pointing forward, right heel in hollow of left foot. Hands held together loosely in front, thumbs linked. Take a short step forward with left foot, bringing the right heel into its hollow.

The VIRGIN enters with the Sword and the Paten. The child enters with the censer and the perfume. They face the DEACON, deploying into line, from the space between the two altars. The VIRGIN: Greeting of Earth and Heaven! All give the Hailing Sign of a Magician, the DEACON leading.5 The PRIESTESS, the negative child on her left, the positive child on her right, ascends the steps of the High Altar. They await her below. She places the Paten before the Graal. Having adored it, she descends, and with the children following her, the positive next her, she moves in a serpentine manner involving 3½ circles of the Temple. (Deosil about altar, widdershins about font, deosil about altar and font, widdershins about altar and so to the Tomb in the West.) She draws her sword and pulls down the Veil therewith.6 The PRIESTESS: By the power of !7 Iron, I say unto thee, Arise. In the name of our Lord the ! Sun, and of our Lord ! Ö, that thou mayest administer the virtues to the Brethren. She sheathes the Sword. The PRIEST, issuing from the Tomb, holding the Lance erect with both hands, right over left, against his breast, takes the first three regular steps.8 He then gives the Lance to the PRIESTESS and gives the three penal signs.9 He then kneels and worships the Lance with both hands. Penitential music. 5 ìMagicianî is II∞ O.T.O. The ìpublicî version is: hands open, thumbs squared. Right hand on left breast, left arm raised: upper arm horizontal, forearm vertical.

The ìpubicî II∞ penal sign is a similar motion across the breast at heart level, the III∞ sign a similar motion across the lower abdomen at navel lavel, concluding by bringing the thumb back up to the navel. These are the penal signs of English Craft Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ECCLESI∆ GNOSTIC∆ CATHOLIC∆ CANON MISS∆ 5The PRIEST: I am a man amongst men. He takes again the Lance and lowers it. He rises. How should I be worthy to administer the virtues to the Brethren? The PRIESTESS takes from the child the water and salt, and mixes them in the font. The PRIESTESS: Let the salt of Earth admonish the Water to bear the virtue of the Great Sea. (Genuflects) Mother, be thou adored! She returns to the West. ! on PRIEST with open hand doth she make, over his forehead, breast and body. Be the PRIEST pure of body and soul!

She returns West, and makes ! with the censer before the PRIEST, thrice as before. Be the PRIEST fervent of body and soul! (The children resume their weapons as they are done with.)

Be the flame of the Sun thine ambiance, O thou PRIEST of the SUN! The DEACON brings the crown from the High Altar. (The crown may be of gold or platinum, or of electrum magicum; but with no other metals, save the small proportions necessary to a proper alloy. It may be adorned with divers jewels; at will. But is must have the Uræus serpent twined about it, and the cap of maintenance must match the scarlet of the robe. Its texture should be velvet.) Be the Serpent thy crown, O thou PRIEST of the LORD!

By the power of the lifted Lance! He raises the Lance. All repeat Hailing Sign. A phrase of triumphant music. The PRIEST takes the PRIESTESS by her right hand with his left, keeping the Lance raised. I, PRIEST and KING, take thee, Virgin pure without spot; I upraise thee; I lead thee to the East; I set thee upon the summit of the Earth. He thrones the PRIESTESS upon the altar. The DEACON and the children follow, they in rank, behind him. The PRIESTESS takes The Book of the Law, resumes her seat, and holds it open on her breast with her two hands, making a descending triangle with thumbs and forefingers. The PRIEST gives the lance to the DEACON to hold; and takes the ewer from the child, and sprinkles the PRIESTESS, making five crosses, forehead, shoulders, and thighs. The thumb of the PRIEST is always between his index and medius, whenever he is not holding the Lance. The PRIEST takes the censer from the child and makes five crosses as before. The children replace their weapons on their respective altars. The PRIEST kisses The Book of the Law three times. He kneels for a space in adoration, with joined hands, knuckles closed, thumb in position as aforesaid. He rises and draws the veil over the whole altar. All rise and stand to order. The PRIEST takes the lance from the DEACON and holds it as before, as Osiris or Ptah. He circumambulates the Temple three times, followed by the DEACON and the children as before. (These, when not using their hands, keep their arms crossed upon their breasts.) At the last circumambulation they leave him and go to the place between the font and the small altar, where they kneel in adoration, their hands joined palm to palm, and raised above their heads.

Therefore by seed and root and stem and bud and leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke Thee. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus: that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous! During this speech the PRIESTESS must have divested herself completely of her robe. See CCXX I:62. The PRIESTESS: But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy.

There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times. A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride! A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.

A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death! A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight! The PRIEST mounts the third step.
