Class ìAî consists of books of which may be changed not so much as the style of a letter: that is, they represent the utterance of an Adept entirely beyond the criticism of even the Visible Head of the Organization. Class ìBî consists of books or essays which are the result of ordinary scholarship, enlightened and earnest. Class ìCî consists of matter which is to be regarded rather as suggestive than anyhting else. Class ìDî consists of the Official Rituals and Instructions. [Class ìEî consists of manifestoes, broadsides, epistles, and other public statements.] Some publications are composite, and pertain to more than one class.

I will go through the changes I have made in order. Major additions or alterations are indicated in the text by square brackets. Description of document classes. Class ìEî was added ca. 1919 and used in the Blue Equinox (Equinox III (1)) for four tracts, two of which had been previously published in The International. H.B. in notes to Appendix I of the ìBlue Brickî observes that three of these (Libri 2, 300 and 837) had earlier been placed in Class ìBî by Crowley in correspondence with C.S. Jones. The description is by the present editor. Class ìAî documents. The designation of Liber XXXI for the MS. of The Book of the Law was first used in a private publication as photographic prints of the MS in 1926, although it was probably introduced a few years previously, when Crowley changed the title of the typeset from ìLiber Lî to ìLiber AL.î A slightly shorter version of the full title (omitting the Hebrew and Greek for Aiwaz and Therion), was used in The Equinox of the Gods. The description is by the present editor. The full title of Liber CCXX has been conformed to that used in the 1938 and subsequent publications. In the 1913 ìSyllabusî the title was ìLiber L vel Legis sub figur‚ CCXX as delivered by LXXVIII to DCLXVI.î While in New York, Crowley had the correct Hebrew spelling of Aiwaz communicated to him by one Samuel A. Jacobs, who knew it for the simple reason that it was his middle name (patronymic, rather), and lo and behold it enumerated to 93; hence in the Blue Equinox the title was given as ìLiber L vel Legis sub figur‚ CCXX as delivered by XCIII to DCLXVI.î Subsequently, following work by Frater Achad (C.S. Jones) on the Qabalistic ìkeyî to the book, Crowley changed the title again, from ìLiber Lî to ìLiber ALî; and finally, on discovering that the name of Aiwass (spelt thus in CCXX I. 7) in Greek could be made to add to 418 by reading the ëwí as a digamma, put this alternate numeration in the title. Class ìBî documents. ìLiber LXI vel CausÊî was listed in Class B in the 1913 ìSyllabusî (it was Class A when printed in the first edition of Θελημα), but when first generally published in the Blue Equinox it was Class D. It therefore appears in Class D in this list. Works published in Class B subsequent to 1913 are included in this list. Where a description was given in the Blue Equinox, that has been used. Where none was so given, one has been written, or taken from some other source."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SYLLABUS OF A∴A∴ 19The description for The Book of Thoth was attached in the 1919 ìPrÊ-monstranceî to the designation Liber LXXVIII which had been previously used for ìA description of the cards of the Taro,î a slight adaptation of a Golden Dawn instruction, published in Equinox I (8). The Book of Thoth bore no number on publication although it is cited as Liber 78 by some. For One Star in Sight I used the sub-title from Magick in Theory and Practice in place of a description. The descriptions of Eight Lectures on Yoga, Little Essays Toward Truth and The Heart of the Master are by the present editor, the last being slightly paraphrased from a reference within the text of the work. The promised completion of Liber LXXXIV was never published and probably never written. The latter part of the description of Liber DCCLXXVII appeared in the 1919 ìCurriculumî and referred to a planned expanded edition of 777. It was never completed and put into order by Crowley, but materials believed to be intended for it were posthumously published as 777 Revised in the 1950s.

It seems likely that ìEnergized Enthusiasmî was intended for inclusion in the 1913 ìSyllabusî in Class C; 811 appears in the list explaining why numbers were given to works; in the 1919 ìCurriculumî it is listed as Liber 811. Again the classification is from Crowley-Jones correspondence. No official description was given in the Blue Equinox, so again the sub-title alone is given. Class ìDî documents. The long title of Liber VIII conflates together two references to this text in Liber XIII. In Equinox IV (1) it was published as ìThe Ritual proper for the invocation of Augoeides.î Liber V and Liber DCCC were published in Class D in Magick in Theory and Practice, from which the description of the former is taken. The description of the latter was originally applied in the 1919 ìPrÊmonstranceî to Liber 365 which was apparently a preliminary designation for this ritual, then still a work in progress. ìLiber Samekhî has also been cited as Liber 120. Liber LXX was said to be in Class D by Crowley in correspondence with Jones. A note on the MS. also refers it to the VI∞ of O.T.O. The long sub-title of the work is used as a description."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"LIBER CCVII 20In the 1913 ìSyllabus,î Libri XVII and CDLI and ìLiber Collegii Interniî were said to be unpublished; the last bore no other description. They are still unpublished. Liber XVII (ìLiber IAOî) was unknown to both Yorke (ìlostî) and the editor of the 1994 ìBlue Brickî (ìpossibly not extantî); I hear occasional rumours of it but have not been able to verify these. Liber 451 (ìLiber Siloamî) is alluded to elsewhere in Crowleyís writings from the Equinox period, and there are also references to a practice called the ìSleep of Siloamî (a term previously used in 19th-century occultist literature) which appears to denote some kind of deliberately induced clairvoyant trance state. A short untitled ritual from around this period which refers to the ìSleep of Siloamî is extant and has been published in The Magical Link; this document is otherwise believed lost. The number 451 has also been applied to a chapter from Liber CDXIV O.T.O., ìDe Arte Magica,î entitled ìOf Eroto-Comatose Lucidityî which describes a technique for achieving a trance state through sexual exhaustion; this though is said to be in Class B, and is believed to have been written ca. 1914. ìLiber Collegii Interniî is not known to survive under that title; possibly related material (i.e., concerning the theory and practice of running a Magical Order) survives in one of Crowleyís notebooks, but is unpublished. Liber XXVIII survives in typescript. It is unpublished, although transcripts of doubtful reliability are in Internet circulation. Two rituals under the number 120 survive in MS. (as noted, this number has also been referred to ìLiber Samekh.î One, believed to be the earlier, gives a rather impractical ritual of initiation with a single officer (although assistants might be required) and Candidate; internal evidence casts doubt on whether it is the A∴A∴Zelator initiation. It has been published as facsimile MS., and transcripts, mostly with a number of lacunÊ, are in Internet circulation. The other is unpublished and I have no information concerning it; the MS. notebook containing it is in the possession of a group claiming to be the A∴A∴ who as far as I know use it as the Zelator initiation and thus do not intend to publish it. Two rituals under the number 671 are extant. ìLiber DCLXXI vel aort,î a scripted initiation ritual with two officers and a candidate, survives in TS. in the collection of Syracuse University, and is unpublished. ìLiber Pyramidos,î a versified solo ritual deriving from the former, survives in a number of MS. and TS. versions, many of which have been published. Neither contains numbered subrituals as stated in the description, though it is easier to see how a later version of the former might have done. While a case could be made for the inclusion of the original Liber 207 in Class D, the present text has been so heavily revised by an editor with no A∴A∴ affilation that it would be misleading to claim an A∴A∴ classification for it.

In the 1913 ìSyllabus,î Libri 418 and 963 were listed, each under its own sub-heading, between the Class ìAî and Class ìBî lists. Liber 333 was included in the Class ìCî list, although the first publication bore a notice proclaiming it to be in ìClasses C and D.î The description of Liber 963 is from the 1919 ìCurriculumî; none was given in the 1913 ìSyllabus.î Liber 415, ìThe Paris Workingî appears in Class AB in a list of A∴A∴ papers prepared by C.S. Jones based on correspondence from Crowley. The subtitle is used in lieu of an official description. The Equinox of the Gods bore a Class E imprint facing the main title page, but ìGenesis Libri AL,î which forms the bulk of the book, bore a Class B imprimatur and Libri XXXI and CCXX are of course Class A. The description is by the present editor. Parts I-III of Book 4 bore no classification on first publication. Parts I and II bore a notice proclaiming them to be ìIssued by order of the GREAT WHITE BROTHERHOOD, known as the A∴A∴.î The Equinox of the Gods, retroactively proclaimed to be Part IV of Book 4 some years after publication, is itself composite as noted. The appendices to Part III include works in classes A, B, and D; parts I and IV also include extracts from ìAha!î (Class C). The subtitles of the four parts are as given in Magick in Theory and Practice; the Blue Equinox gave them as ì(1) Mysticism (2) Magical Theory (3) Magical Practice (4) The Law.î Part I bore the internal title ìMeditationî on first publication (1912) but was cited as ìMysticismî in advertisments around the period; Part II bore the internal title ìMagickî on first publication (1913), corrected to ìMagick (Theory)î in the errata, by which title it was cited in advertisments at the time. Unclassified or unknown. This includes extant works listed in the 1919 ìPrÊmonstranceî or ìCurriculumî which have not within my knowledge had a document class assigned by Crowley either on publication or subsequently. It is beyond the scope of the present treatment to speculate on which class they belong in. Liber LXXIV, ìLiber Testis Testudinisî was lost for some time and only recovered in the mid-1990s; it is not referenced in any of Crowleyís other works that I am aware of. The description is mine. ìThe Rites of Eleusisî is given the number 850 in a MS. note by Crowley to The Equinox. The description is from Appendix I of MTP. All other descriptions in this section are from the Blue Equinox. Liber 1264 was never completed by Crowley, although some of his notes on Greek and Coptic numerology are extant; a reconstruction of the work from some of these notes was published in the O.T.O. newsletter in the 1970s in Class B, but the authority for this classification is dubious in the extreme."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"LIBER CCVII 22Omission of O.T.O. documents. Certain documents of O.T.O., both public and internal, have had A∴A∴ classes assigned to them at various occasions, mostly in correspondence between Crowley and C.S. Jones. These include: * The public documents Liber CI, ìAn Open Letter to those who may wish to join the Orderî and Liber CLXI, ìConcerning the Law of Thelemaî (both Class B). * The high-degree instruction papers, Liber XXIV, ìDe Nuptiis Secretis Deorum cum Hominibus,î Liber C, ìAgape Azoth Sal Philosophorumî (or ìLiber [kî), Liber CCXXVIII, ìDe Natura Deorum,î Liber CCCLXVII, ìDe Homunculoî and Liber CDXIV, ìDe Arte Magica secundum Ritum Gradus NonÊ O.T.O.î (all Class B with the exception of Liber C which was listed Class D in the 1913 ìSyllabusî). They are all omitted from the present edition of the ìSyllabus.î The public documents bore no A∴A∴ imprint on their Equinox publication, but instead bore an O.T.O. ìIssued by orderî notice. As regards others, there is the problem that Probationers of A∴A∴ were required (Liber 185, Task of a Probationer) to study publications in class B, but these texts, prior to their publication (and there are doubts about the completeness and reliability of the published texts) would only have been available to initiates of an appropirate O.T.O. degree. The public O.T.O. document Liber XV, ìEcclesiÊ GnostiÊ CatholicÊ Canon MissÊî was listed in the ìPrÊmonstrance of A∴A∴î in the Blue Equinox, but did not bear an A∴A∴ imprint on any of its publications and does not appear to have ever had an A∴A∴ class referred to it; it is thus here omitted. The 1919 ìPrÊmonstranceî lists a Liber CVI as ìA treatise on the nature of Death, and the proper attitude to be taken towards it.î In Jonesí notes (cited in the Blue Brick) Liber 106 is listed in Class B. This work is generally identified as identical with ìAn Epistle of Baphomet to the Illustrious Damozel Anna Wright Ö Concerning Death,î which was first published in The International in December 1917 (this work had no number attached on publication but was identified as Liber 106 in Appendix I of Magick in Theory and Practice) and on internal evidence is a public O.T.O. document; the identification is reasonable and no other plausible candidate for Liber 106 is known; it is thus here omitted. The paper ìArtemis Iota vel de coitu scholiÊ triviÊî is said to be Liber 666 in Class B (according to the editor of the ìBlue Brick,î this classification appears on the MS.); again, this appears to have originally been an O.T.O. paper, first generally published in Magick Without Tears. Liber LXXVII, ìOZ,î while published without either A∴A∴ or O.T.O. imprint and signed by Crowley with his mundane name, was said in corres-pondence to pertain to O.T.O., and derives from material written for O.T.O. circa 1916 (later included in the New Comment on Liber AL)."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"SYLLABUS OF A∴A∴ 23Other omissions A few works from the 1919 ìPrÊmonstranceî which are unpublished and believed lost or unwritten are omitted, as are some other ìlost works.î These include: Liber V. In ìLiber Viarum ViÊ,î a Liber V is referred to the Path of h and described as ìThe Formulation of the Flaming Star.î In Liber 185 it is written that the Philosophus shall study and practice the meditations described in Liber V. This cannot be ìLiber V vel Reguliî because of the dates involved; nor can it be Crowleyís ìTrue Greater Ritual of the Pentagramî as published in the Magical Link as that is said to be for the use of Adepts only and in any case does not contain any ìmeditationsî as such. Liber XXV. In ìLiber Viarum ViÊ,î a Liber XXV is referred to the Path of n and described as ìThe Preparation of the Corpse for the Tomb.î In ìLiber RV vel Spiritus,î a Liber XXV is mentioned in connection with the practice of mahāsatipatthāna, and in Liber XIII mahāsatipatthāna is referred to the Path of n (the aspirant is there directed to Crowleyís Science and Buddhism for the practice). While there have been some ingenious arguments put forward as to how this could mean the Star Ruby, the dates involved are problematic. Liber XLIX, ìShi Yi Chiíen.î Believed no longer extant and probably never completed; also mentioned in Crowleyís article on ìGeomancyî in the International, which appears to suggest it describes a scheme akin to I Ching but with 7 binary elements for a total of 128 figures. Liber LXXIII. Mentioned in ìLiber Viarum ViÊî under the heading ìThe Supreme Ecstasy of Purityî and referred to the Path of g. Because of the dates involved, cannot be ìThe Urnî which is mentioned in the 1919 ìPrÊmon-stranceî as Liber LXXIII and is extant in part. Liber XCVII, ìSoror Achithaís Vision.î Cited in ìThe Abuldiz Workingî and the ìNew Commentî on Liber AL; no work of this title is known to survive. It may be identical to Liber 729, ìThe Amalantrah Workingî (Soror Achitha was Roddie Minor, principal skryer on the Amalantrah working); the passages quoted do not appear in the surviving TSS. of Liber 729, but these are incom-plete and the original MS. is lost so the identification remains an open question. Liber CCLXV, ìThe Structure of the Mind.î Listed in the 1919 ìPrÊmon-stranceî as ìa treatise on psychology from the mystic and magical standpoint.î Not completed; an outline survives in Crowleyís diaries. Liber DCLXVI, ìThe Beast.î Described in the 1919 ìPrÊmonstranceî as ìan account of the Magical Personality who is the Logos of the present ∆on.î While this work is sometimes identified with ìThe Master Therion: A Biographical Note,î on internal evidence the latter postdates the former citation by some years. It has been suggested (e.g. in the edition of Magick edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant) that this work developed into the autobiographical chapters of ìGenesis Libri ALî in The Equinox of the Gods, but this must also be regarded as speculative."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"LIBER CCVII 24Liber DCCCVIII, ìLiber Serpentis Nehustan.î There is a reference to 808 as being the number of the name }tcjn in the section of the Syllabus explaining why numbers have been given to texts, but no work of this number appeared in the main list; the title, number and fact of its being unpublished so far were handwritten in by Crowley in one of his copies of Equinox I (10). It has not been published and is possibly no longer extant. An editorial note in the ìBlue Brickî edition of Magick states that ìan unpublished MS. with a different title survives that might correspond to this paper.î Possibly Breeze was alluding to one of the rituals later published in The Magical Link. Liber CMXXXIV, ìThe Cactus.î Listed in the 1919 ìPrÊmonstrance,î this work, intended as a study of the effects of Anhalonium lewinii (mescal buttons) was never finished, and what had been written of it (notes from a series of experiments) was destroyed by HM Customs as part of a batch of seized Crowley books and MSS. Liber MCXXXIX. In ìLiber Viarum ViÊî this number is referred to the Path of z under the heading ìThe Utterance of the Pythoness.î I have it on rumour that a work of this number survives in a private collection but I have no description of its contents, and suspect it may have been written as a retro-fit to the Liber 868 reference by a later A∴A∴ group. Finally, a number of extant numbered papers are omitted on the grounds that it is doubtful whether they belong on the Syllabus. ìThe Abuldiz Workingî (the record of a magical working with Mary díEste Sturges in 1911) was published as Liber LX in Class C in Equinox IV (2), similarly ìThe Bartzabel Workingî (the ritual script and record of a ceremonial evocation, the ritual script alone having appeared in Equinox I (9) as ìAn Evocation of Bartzabel the Spirit of Mars,î was published in Equinox IV (2) as Liber CCCXXV in Class C. In both instances the number and class were assigned by the modern group responsible for publication. Liber XCIII, ìLiber abx vel NikÈî (also cited as Liber XXVIII) is Crowleyís drug-withdrawal diary from February-March 1922. ìLiber Vesta vel tkrp,î published as Liber DCC in Class D in Equinox IV (1), while based on some early Crowley notes and sketches for the robes of A∴A∴, is a creation of the modern group responsible for its publication. Reasons for assignment of numbers. Those in square brackets and smaller type are by the present editor; many are tentative.
