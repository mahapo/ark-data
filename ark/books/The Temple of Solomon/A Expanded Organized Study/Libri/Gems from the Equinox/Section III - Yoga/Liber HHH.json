No fish play in thy depths. 2. Let a Breath rise and ruffle the waters. This also thou shalt feel playing upon thy skin. It will disturb thy meditation twice or thrice, after which thou shouldst have conquered in. But unless thou first feel it, that Breath hath not arisen. 3. Next, the night is riven by the lightning-flash. This also shalt thou feel in thy body, which shall shiver and leap with the shock, and that also must both be suffered and overcome. 4. After the lightning-flash, resteth in the zenith a minute point of light. And this light shall radiate until a right cone be established upon the sea, and it is day. With this thy body shall be rigid, automatically; and this shalt thou let endure, withdrawing thyself into thine heart in the form of an upright Egg of blackness; and therein shalt thou abide for a space. 5.

Two-and-twenty times shall he figure to himself that he is bitten by a serpent, feeling even in his body the poison thereof. And let each bite be healed by an eagle or hawk, spreading its wings above his head, and dropping thereupon an healing dew.

Think of thy death; imagine the various the various diseases that may attack thee, or accidents overtake thee. Picture the process of death, applying always to thyself. (A useful preliminary practice is to read text-books of Pathology, and to visit museums and dissecting-rooms.) 2. Continue this practice until death is complete; follow the corpse through the stages of embalming, wrapping and burial. 3. Now imagine a divine breath entering thy nostrils. 4. Next, imagine a divine light enlightening the eyes. 5. Next, imagine the divine voice awakening the ears. 6. Next, imagine a divine kiss imprinted on the lips. 7. Next, imagine the divine energy informing the nerves and muscles of the body, and concentrate on the phenomenon which will already have been observed in 3, the restoring of the circulation. 8. Last, imagine the return of the reproductive power; and employ this to the impregnation of the Egg of light in which man is bathed. 9. Now represent to thyself that this egg is the Disk of the Sun, setting in the west. 10. Let it sink into blackness, borne in the bark of heaven, upon the back of the holy cow Hathor.

And it shall come to pass that if thou hast well and properly performed this meditation that on a sudden thou shalt hear the drone and booming of a Beetle. 12. Now then shall the Blackness pass, and with rose and gold shalt thou arise in the East, with the cry of an Hawk resounding in thine ear. Shrill shall it be and harsh. 13. At the end shalt thou rise and stand in the midheaven, a globe of glory. And therewith shall arise the mighty Sound that holy men have likened unto the roaring of a Lion. 14. Then shalt thou withdraw thyself from the Vision, gathering thyself into the divine form of Osiris upon his throne. 15. Then shalt thou repeat audibly the cry of triumph of the god rearisen, as it shall have been given unto thee by the Superior.9 16. And this being accomplished, thou mayest enter again into the Vision, that thereby shalt be perfect in thee. 17. After this shalt thou return into the body, and give thanks unto the Most High God IAIDA; yea, unto the Most High God IAIDA.10 18. Mark well that this operation should be performed if it be possible in a place set apart and consecrated to the Works of the Magic of Light. Also that the Temple should be ceremonially open as thou hast knowledge and skill to perform, and that at the end thereof the closing should be most carefully accomplished. But in the preliminary practice it is enough if thou cleanse thyself by ablution, by robing, and by the rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram. 0-2 should be practiced at first, until some realisation is obtained; and the practice should always be followed by a divine invocation of Apollo or of Isis or of Jupiter or of Serapis.

At any time during this meditation, the concentration may bring about samādhi. This is to be feared and shunned, more than any other breaking of control, for that it is the most tremendous of the forces which threaten to obsess.

I. 36-40. 0. Be seated in thine āsana, preferably the Thunderbolt. It is essential that the spine be vertical. 1. In this practice the cavity of the brain is the Yoni; the spinal cord is the Lingam. 2. Concentrate thy thought of adoration in the brain. 3. Now begin to awake the spine in this manner. Concentrate thy thought of thyself in the base of the spine, and move it up gradually a little at a time. By this means thou wilt become conscious of the spine, feel-ing each vertebra as a separate entity. This must be achieved most fully and perfectly before the further practice is begun. 4. Next, adore the brain as before, but figure to thyself its con-tent as infinite. Deem it to be the womb of Isis, or the body of Nuit."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SVB FIGVR¬ CCCXLI 75. Next, identify thyself with the base of the spine as before, but figure to thyself its energy as infinite. Deem it to be the phallus of Osiris, or the being of Hadit. 6. These two concentrations 4 and 5 may be pushed to the point of samādhi. Yet lose not control of the will; let not samādhi be thy master herein. 7. Now then, being conscious both of the brain and the spine, and unconscious of all else, do thou imagine the hunger of the one for the other; the emptiness of the brain, the ache of the spine, even as the emptiness of space and the aimlessness of Matter. And if thou hast experience of the Eucharist in both kinds,12 it shall aid thine imagination herein. 8. Let this agony grow until it be insupportable, resisting by will every temptation. Not until thine whole body is bathed in sweat, or it may be in sweat of blood, and until a cry of intolerable anguish is forced from thy closed lip, shalt thou proceed. 9. Now let a current of light, deep azure flecked with scarlet, pass up and down the spine, striking as it were upon thyself that art coiled at the base as a serpent. Let this be exceeding slow and subtle; and though it be accom-panied with pleasure, resist; and though it be accompanied with pain, resist. 10. This shalt thou continue until thou art exhausted, never relaxing the control. Until thou canst perform this one section 9 during a whole hour, proceed not. And withdraw from the medi-tation by an act of will, passing into a gentle prānāyāma without kumbhakha, and meditating on Harpocrates, the silent and virginal God. 11.

In contrast to the ìwaters of contemplation,î the ìflames of enthu-siasmî were supposedly treated of in ìLiber IAOî (17) which is unpub-lished and believed lost (I have been informed that a work claiming to be Liber IAO survives in a private collection, with a Latin prologue and quotes from Liber LXV and VII paralleling those here, but have been unable to authenticate it or even study a copy). 2 Grk., ìcorpse.î The reference is to cap. II, AAA, which parallels ìLiber Cadavarisî (120). Compare also the meditations on various kinds of corpses described in the Māhasatipatthāna Sutta. 3 Grk., ìpyramid.î The reference is to cap. I, MMM, which parallels ìLiber Pyramidosî (671). 4 Grk., ìphallus.î The reference is to cap. III, SSS. 5 The four kinds of ìenthusiasmî or ìdivine madnessî (the first being poetic inspiration from the nine Muses) are discussed in Platoís Phaedrus and treated of by Renaissance writers such as Ficino in his commentary on the Symposium, Agrippa in De occulta philosophia lib. III cap. 45-49, and Giordano Bruno in De gli eroici furori. See also Crowleyís essay ìEnergised Enthusiasmî (Liber 811). It is believed that ìLiber IAO,î if it was ever written, described meditation or magick practices based on these three ìenthusiasms.î 6 To explain this piece of Qabalistic analogic: the Divine Names hyha and hwhy, having as they do the letter-pair hy in common, may be combined to give a single six-letter name hwhyha, which is said to unite Microprosopus and Macro-prosopus (it enumerates to 32, the total number of Paths and Sephiroth, the number of the ìpaths of wisdomî mentioned in the Sepher Yetzirah. Next, since h is the letter of the Mother, we substitute for the three hís the three ìMother lettersî of the Hebrew alphabet, a, m and c, giving awmyca (or some permutation thereof), which enumerates to 358, the number of cjn, nechesh, a serpent (e.g. in Gen. iii), and jycm, Messiach, the Anointed One.

The other three letters, aleph, yod and vau, re-arranged, give way, a Hebrew spelling of IAO, which adds to 17. Even leaving aside the purported Liber IAO, there is evidence in other Crowley MSS. that he referred the letters of IAO to the ìthree Enthusiasmsî as I = Iacchus (Dionysus), A = Aphrodite, O = `Orus (as a cognate of Apollo: a per-missable fudge since the aspirate is not a letter in Greek). 7 This whole section parallels ìLiber Pyramidosî fairly closely and is the ìmeditation practice corresponding to Ritual DCLXXIî mentioned in Liber XIII. The versified solo version of Liber 671 which has been published is adequate for the purposes of exploring the parallels, although one suspects the meditation-practice will be more effective for one who has gone through the ritual ceremonially and imprinted the revelant symbols. 8 Approx, ìcorpse-position.î The ìcorpseî and ìdying Buddhaî āsanas (along with the ìHanged Manî posture mentioned in cap. I v. 10) were depicted in a supplement to ìLiber Eî which was printed at the start of Equinox I (7), and also in the 1994 and 1997 Weiser ìBlue Brickî edition of Magick. 9 This possibly refers to something communicated in the Zelator initiation (see note below). 10 IAIDA or ìthe Highestî is a name or title of God appearing in the Angelic Keys of Dee and Kelly. See Casaubon (ed.), A True and Faithful Relation. 11 This section is the ìmeditation practice corresponding to Ritual CXXî referred to in Liber XIII. Unfortunately the published (after a fashion) version of Liber 120, the Ritual of Passing through the Tuat, appears to be an early draft differing in a number of respects from the one on which this practice is based. In any case, it is based on Egyptian texts describing the nightly journey of the Sun through twelve divisions of the Underworld. See for example Budge, The Egyptian Heaven and Hell. 12 I am not entirely sure what Alice is talking about here, but can take a guess. 13 Apocalypse XIII. 14. 14 H.B. in an editorial note to the ìBlue Brickî demonstrates that this is one of the ìmethods of Sabhapaty Swamiî referred to in ìLiber O,î being derived from a rājayoga practice described in a book by said author; a summary by Crowley survives in his diaries."}]
