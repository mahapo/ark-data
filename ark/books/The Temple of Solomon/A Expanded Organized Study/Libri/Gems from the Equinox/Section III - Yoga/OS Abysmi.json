Let him also be accomplished in Logic. (Formal Logic, Keynes.11) Further let him study any classical works to which his attention may be sufficiently directed in the course of his reading. 10. Now let him consider special problems, such as the Origin of the World, the Origin of Evil, Infinity, the Absolute, the Ego and the non-Ego, Freewill and Destiny, and such others as may attract him. 11. Let him subtly and exactly demonstrate the fallacies of every known solution, and let him seek a true solution by his right Ingenium. 12. In all this let him be guided only by clear reason, and let him forcibly suppress all other qualities such as Intuition, Aspiration, Emotion, and the like. 13. During these practices all forms of Magick Art and Meditation are forbidden to him. It is forbidden to him to seek any refuge from his intellect. 14.

Then will all phenomena which present themselves to him appear meaningless and disconnected, and his own Ego will break up into a series of impressions having no relation one with the other, or with any other thing. 17. Let this state then become so acute that it is in truth Insanity, and let this continue until exhaustion. 18. According to a certain deeper tendency of the individual will be the duration of this state. 19. It may end in real insanity, which concludes the activities of the Adept during this present life, or by his rebirth into his own body and mind with the simplicity of a little child. 20.
