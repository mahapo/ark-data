If they refuse the task from laziness or from a feeling that they have more important business (as their Neophyte may judge) then may V.V.V.V.V. 8°=38 himself inform them with much deference that they are now fitted for admission to the Mystery of the Seven Holy Kings. The Temple is arranged as shewn in the attached illustration.1 The God of the first Throne hath robes of Deep Blue; second – Violet; 3rd. – Scarlet; 4th. – Orange; 5th. – Green; 6th. – Pale Yellow; 7th. – Bright Blue.2 The other officers are the Hegemon, clad in white & masked in white, & in his hand is the Phoenix Wand of the Planets;3 & the Hiereus, masked in black & robed in black, in his hands are the Scourge & Crook.4 The Candidate, well fed & joyful, clad in the Robe of a Probationer, & crowned with laurel, is led by the Hegemon (his Neophyte) into the Hall. Taken to the altar, on which burns a small fire of odorous wood, cedar or sandal or lign aloes, he is made to kneel thereat, & the Black officer comes forward threatening him with his scourge & saith: Hiereus: Who art Thou? Hegemon (for Cand.): I am the Aspirant to the Sacred & Sublime Order of A∴A∴ & I seek the aid of Osiris.   1 Missing in this copy. But the text implies that the temple contains (i) an altar of some kind, probably in the West (near the entrance to the room), (ii) seven thrones for the planetary stations, probably arranged in a heptagon, with the fourth in the East, (iii) a dais of seven steps in the East, beyond the station of Sol, with a throne atop it, and (iv) a small side room, “a dark dungeon.” 2 They should also have appropriate masks and weapons. 3 See the Golden Dawn Adeptus Minor ritual. 4 The traditional emblems of Osiris. The ‘scourge’ was probably a flail used for threshing grain. The script also has one speech given by the Hierophant who is mentioned nowhere else."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2(note: This ceremony can be adapted for working by two officers, the Hegemon assuming each time a different coloured cloak, & the appropriate God-form. But it is most desirable that the full complement of Nine should assist.) “Hail unto thee, Osiris, triumphant, Lord of Amennta, Lord of Enenet! Hail unto thee, all glorious sun of mercy & justice, upon whose head is the golden crown of light that is invisible to men! Hail unto thee, hail unto thee, sole light in our darkness! Hail unto thee through whom alone (...)5 may attain unto the Brotherhood Immortal.

The Hegemon thrusts him furiously into this with hand & foot, all crying aloud: “Osiris is a black god.” There he must remain for seven hours. (If at any point previous in the ritual he should say: “I ask not these blessings; I seek Osiris. What saith yon silent dark one?” or words of similar purport, the Hegemon answers, removing the hoodwink once and for all:6 “Verily, thou sayest well; know that Osiris is a black God, & the straight way unto the Sacred & Sublime Order lieth not through the green pastures & beside still waters. But in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, His crook & scourge shall avail thee. “Take them therefore & fold thine arms upon thy breast; ascend with me the seven steps of the Throne.” The Aspirant then does so, standing between the officers. The Fourth Throne is removed to leave a passage. The Seven Kings rush upon him & belabor him with their weapons; but he makes his way & they fall one by one; the Seventh upon the Second step, the Sixth upon the Third, the Fifth upon the Fourth, the Fourth upon the Fifth, the Third upon the Sixth, the Second upon the Seventh & the First at the Foot of the Throne. The Aspirant passes over their bodies & takes his seat. They then, each from his place, adore him while the two officers support him on either side, & the Hierophant addresses him: “Frater _____ this day have I symbolically placed thee in the seat of a Brother of the A∴A∴. See to it that thy life truly reflect this gradual conquest of the Powers7 of the Seven, & never forget that thy path is the path of Osiris,8 – & that Osiris is a black God.” They then conduct him from the temple.) After the seven hours are past, the Aspirant is rescued by Osiris, the black officer, in the words already given, omitting “Verily thou sayest well” & using a sterner tone for the beginning of the speech. The ceremony then proceeds as before. Source: This text was emailed to me in January of 2001. I am unaware of its provenance. Certain errors in the copy I was sent suggest it had been OCR scanned at some point. The statements at the start of this ritual makes it clear what is meant by the comment in Liber XIII and elsewhere about “certain Probationers” being admitted to Ritual XXVIII after 6 months. This is not the ritual of initiation of a Probationer; it is a punishment ritual for slackers. Certain apparent omissions and inconsistencies suggest that this is a first draft – T.S.   6 Which implies, although it is not stated in the text, that at the start of the ritual the Candidate is hoodwinked. The hoodwink would be lifted briefly at each of the seven planetary stations. 7 The text I was sent had “Posers” but this was probably an OCR error; other such errors, e.g. 0 for O have been silently corrected. 8 This statement may seem strange given the whole big deal made of Horus replacing Osiris, etc., but a few things are perhaps worthy of mention here. Firstly, in the early years of the A∴A∴, Crowley may have considered this a mystery pertaining to a higher degree than Probationer; e.g., only giving Liber Legis to Zelators, and believed that even in the Æon of Horus, the formula of Osiris still needed to be assimilated before it could be transcended; further, note that in this ritual it is the Hiereus who represents Osiris, wheras in the G.D. the Hiereus was Horus in the Avenger of the Gods aspect and the Hierophant Osiris; so in fact, they have been changed over."}]
