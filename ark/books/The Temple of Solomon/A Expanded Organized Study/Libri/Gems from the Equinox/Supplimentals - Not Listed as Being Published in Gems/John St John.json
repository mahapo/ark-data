FRATER O∴M∴"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" A∴A∴ Publication in Class C."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 3 PREFACE NOBODY is better aware than myself that this account of my Retirement labours under most serious disadvantages. The scene should have been laid in an inaccessible lamaserai in Tibet, perched on stupendous crags; and my familiarity with Central Asia would have enabled me to do it quite nicely. One should really have had an attendant Sylph; and one's Guru, a man of incredible age and ferocity, should have frequently appeared at the dramatic moment. A gigantic magician on a coal-black steed would have added to the effect: strange voices, uttering formidable things, should have issued from unfathomable caverns. A mountain shaped like a Svastika with a Pillar of Flame would have been rather taking; herds of impossible yaks, ghost-dogs, gryphons. ... But my good, friends, this is not the way things happen. Paris is as wonderful as Lhassa, and there are just as many miracles in London as in Luang Prabang. I did not even think it necessary to go into the Bois de Boulogne and meet those Three Adepts who cause bleeding at the nose, familiar to us from the writings of Macgregor Mathers. The Universe of Magic is in the mind of a man: the setting is but Illusion even to the thinker. Humanity is progressing; formerly men dwelt habitually in the exterior world; nothing less than giants and Paynim and men-at-arms and distressed ladies, vampires and succubi, could amuse them. Their magicians brought demons from the smoke of blood, and made gold from baser metals. In this they succeeded; the intelligent perceived that the gold and the lead were but shadows of thought. It became probable that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCLX 4the elements were but isomers of one element; matter was seen to be but a modification of mind, or (at least) that the two things matter and mind must be joined before either could be perceived. All knowledge comes through the senses, on the one hand; on the other, it is only through the senses that knowledge comes. We then continue our conquest of matter; and we are getting pretty expert. It took much longer to perfect the telescope than the motor-car. And though, of course, there are limitations, we know enough to be able to predict them. We know in what progression the Power to Speed coefficient of a steamboat risesóand so on. But in our conquest of Nature, which we are making principally by the use of the rational intelligence of the mind, we have become aware of that world itself, so much so that educated men spend nine-tenths of their waking lives in that world, only descending to feed and dress and so on at the imperative summons of their physical constitution. Now to us who thus live the world of mind seems almost as savage and unexplored as the world of Nature seemed to the Greeks. There are countless worlds of wonder unpath'd and uncomprehendedóand even unguessed, we doubt not. Therefore we set out diligently to explore and map these untrodden regions of the mind. Surely our adventures may be as exciting as those of Cortes or Cook! It is for this reason that I invite with confidence the attention of humanity to this record of my journey. But another set of people will find another disappointment. I am hardly an heroic figure. I am not The Good Young Man That Died. I do not remain in holy meditation, balanced on my left eyelash, for forty years, restoring exhausted nature by a single grain of rice at intervals of several months. You will perceive in these pages a man with all his"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"JOHN ST. JOHN 5imperfections thick upon him trying blindly, yet with all his force, to control the thoughts of his mind, so that he shall be able to say ìI will think this thought and not that thoughtî at any moment, as easily as (having conquered Nature) we are all able to say ìI will drink this wine, and not that wine.î For, as we have now learnt, our happiness does not at all depend upon our possessions or our power. We would all rather be dead than be a millionaire who lives in daily dread of murder or blackmail. Our happiness depends upon our state of mind. It is the mastery of these things that the Magicians of to-day have set out to obtain for humanity; they will not turn back, or turn aside. It is with the object of giving the reins into the hands of others that I have written this record, not without pain. Others, reading it, will see the sort of way one sets to work; they will imitate and improve upon it; they will attain to the Magistry; they will prepare the Red Tincture and the Elixir of Lifeófor they will discover what Life means. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 6 PROLOGUE IT hath appeared unto me fitting to make a careful and even an elaborate record of this Great Magical Retirement, for that in the first place I am now certain of obtaining some Result therefrom, as I was never previously certain. Previous records of mine have therefore seemed vague and obscure, even unto the wisest of the scribes; and I am myself afraid that even here all my skill of speech and study may avail me little, so that the most important part of the record will be blank. Now I cannot tell whether it is a part of my personal Kamma, or whether the Influence of the Equinox of Autumn should be the exciting cause; but it has usually been at this part of the year that my best Results have occurred. It may be that the physical health induced by the summer in me, who dislike damp and chill, may being forth as it were a flower the particular kind of EnergyóSammav·yamoówhich gives alike the desire to perform more definitely and exclusively the Great Work, and the capacity to achieve success. It is in any case remarkable that I was born in October (1875); suffered the terrible mystic trance which turned me toward the Path in October (1896); applied for admission to G∴ D∴ in October (1898); opened my temple at Boleskine in October (1899); received the mysteries of L.I.L. in October (1900); and obtained the grade of 6∞ = 5∞; obtained the first true mystic results in October (1901); first landed in Egypt in October (1902); landed again in Egypt in October (1903); first parted from Rose in October (1904); wrote the B.-i-M.1 in October (1905), and obtained 1 [i.e. the Bagh-i-Muattar, also known as The Scented Garden of Abdullah the Satirist of Shiraz. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"JOHN ST. JOHN 7the grade of 7∞ = 4∞; received the great Initiation in October 1906; and, continuing, received the Books LXV and VII, etc. in October 1907. So then in the last days of September 1908 do I begin to collect and direct my thoughts; gently, subtly, persistently turning them one and all to the question of retreat and communion with that which I have agreed to call the Holy Guardian Angel, whose Knowledge and Conversation I have willed, and in greater or less measure enjoyed, since Ten Years. Terrible have been the ordeals of the Path; I have lost all that I possessed, and all that I love, even as at the Beginning I offered All for Nothing, unwitting as I was of the meaning of those words. I have suffered many and grievous things at the hands of the elements, and of the planets; hunger, thirst, fatigue, disease, anxiety, bereavement, all those woes and others have laid heavy hand upon me, and behold! as I look back upon these years, I declare that all hath been very well. For so great is the Reward which I (unworthy) have attained that the Ordeals seem but incidents hardly worthy to mention, save in so far as they are the Levers by which I moved the World. Even those dreadful periods of ìdrynessî and of despair seem but the necessary lying fallow of the Earth. All those ìfalse pathsî of Magic and Meditation and of Reason were not false paths, but steps upon the true Path; even a a tree must shoot downwards its roots into the Earth in order that it may flower, and bring forth fruit in its season. So also now I know that even in my months of absorption in worldly pleasure and business, I am not really there, but stand behind, preparing the Event. Imagine me, therefore, if you will, in Paris on the last day of September. How surprised was Ióthough, had I thought, I should have remembered that it was soóto find all my necessary magical apparatus to my hand! Months before, for quite other reasons, I had moved most of my portable property to Paris; now I go to Paris, not thinking of a Retirement, for I now know enough to trust my destiny to bring all things to pass without anxious"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCLX 8forethought on my partóand suddenly, therefore, here do I find myselfóand nothing is lacking. I determined therefore to begin steadily and quietly, allowing the Magical Will to come slowly forth, daily stronger, in contrast to my old plan, desperation kindling a store of fuel dried by long neglect, despair inflaming a mad energy that would blaze with violence for a few hours and then go outóand nothing done. ìNot hurling, according to the oracle, a transcendent foot towards Piety.î Quite slowly and simply therefore did I wash myself and robe myself as laid down in the Goetia, taking the Violet Robe of an Exempt Adept (being a single Garment), wearing the Ring of an Exempt Adept, and that Secret Ring which hath been entrusted to my keeping by the Masters. Also I took the Almond Wand of Abramelin and the Secret Tibetan Bell, made of Electrum Magicum with its striker of human bone. I took also the magical knife, and the holy Anointing Oil of Abramelin the Mage. I began then quite casually by performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, finding to my great joy and some surprise that the Pentagrams instantly formulated themselves, visible to the material eye as it were bars of shining blackness deeper than the night. I then consecrated myself to the Operation; cutting the Tonsure upon my head, a circle, as it were to admit the light of infinity: and cutting the cross of blood upon my breast, thus symbolising the equilibration of and the slaying of the body, while loosing the blood, the first projection in matter of the universal Fluid. The whole formulating the Ankhóthe Key of Life! I gave moreover the signs of the grades from 0∞=0∞ to 7∞=4∞. Then did I take upon myself the Great Obligation1 as follows: I. I, O.M. &c., a member of the Body of God, hereby bind myself on behalf of the whole Universe, even as we are now physically bound unto the cross of suffering: 1 [This is the ìOath of the Abyssî or the oath of 8∞=3∞. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"JOHN ST. JOHN 9II. that I will lead a pure life, as a devoted servant of the Order: III. that I will understand all things: IV. that I will love all things V. that I will perform all things and endure all things VI. that I will continue in the Knowledge and Conversation of My Holy Guardian Angel: VII. that I will work without attachment: VIII. that I will work in truth: IX. that I will rely only upon myself: X. that I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my soul. And if I fail herein, may my pyramid be profaned, and the Eye be closed upon me! All this did I swear and seal with a stroke upon the Bell. Then I steadily sat down in my āsana (or sacred Posture), having my left heel beneath my body pressing into the anus, my right sole closely covering the phallus, the right leg vertical; my head, neck, and spine in one straight vertical line; my arms stretched out resting on their respective knees;1 my thumbs joined each to the fourth finger of the proper hand. All my muscles were tightly held; my breath came steady, slow and even through both nostrils; my eyes were turned back, in, up to the Third Eye; my tongue was rolled back in my mouth; and my thoughts, radiating from that Third Eye, I strove to shut in unto an ever narrowing sphere by concentrating my will upon the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Then I struck Twelve times upon the Bell; with the new month the Operation was duly begun. 1 [This is the ìThunderboltî position or svastikāsana described in ìLiber E.î]"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCLX 10Oct. 1. The First Day At Eight o'clock I rose from sleep and putting on my Robe, began a little to meditate. For several reasonsóthe journey and business of the day before, etc., etc., I did not feel fresh. But forcing myself a little I rose and went out to the CafÇ du DÙme where I took coffee and a biroche, after buying an exercise book in which to write this record. This was about 8.45; and now (10.10) I have written thus far. [Including the Prologue, but not the Preface.óED.] 10.45. I have driven over to the Hammam through the beautiful sunshine, meditating upon the discipline of the Operation. It seems only necessary to cut off definitely dispersive things, aimless chatter and such; for the Operation itself will guide one, leading to disgust for too much food and so on. It there by upon my limbs any chain that requires a definite effort to break it, perhaps sleep is that chain. But we shall seeósolvitur ambulando.1 If any asceticism be desirable later on, true wariness will soon detect any danger, and devise a means to meet it and overcome it. 12.00. Have finished bath and massage, during which I continued steadily but quite gently, ìnot by a strain laborious and hurtful but with stability void of movement,î willing the Presence of Adonai. 12.05. I ordered a dozen oysters and a beefsteak, and now (12.10) find myself wishing for an apple chewed and swallowed by deglutition, as the hatha-yogīs do. The distaste for food has already begun. 12.12. Impressions already failing to connect. I was getting into āsana and thinking ìI record this fact,î when I saw a jockey being weighed. I thought of recording my own weight which I had not taken.

I shall take ìHua allalu alazi lailaha illa huaî1 for mantra [any sacred sentence, whose constant repetition produces many strange effects upon the mind.óED.] if I want one, or: may Adonai reveal unto me a special mantra to invoke Him! 3.51.

[The nature of this Ritual is explained later.óED.] 5.10 I have returned from my shopping. Strange how solemn and dignified so trivial a thing becomes, once one has begun to concentrate! I bought two pears, half a pound of Garibaldi biscuits, and a packet of Gaufrettes. I had a citron pressÈ, too, at the DÙme. At the risk of violating the precepts of Zoroaster 170 and 144 I propose to do a Tarot divination for this Operation.1 1 [In Westcottís edition, fragment 144 of the ChaldÊan Oracles runs: ìDirect not thy mind to the vast surfaces of the Earth; for the Plant of Truth grows not upon the ground. Nor measure the motions of the Sun, collecting rules, for he is carded by the Eternal Will of the Father,. and not for your sake alone. Dismiss (from your mind) the impetuous course of the Moon, for she moveth always by the power of necessity. The progression of the Stars was not generated for your sake. The wide aÎrial flight of birds gives no true knowledge nor the dissection of the entrails of victims; they are all mere toys, the basis of mercenary fraud:, flee from these if you would enter the sacred paradise of piety, where Virtue, Wisdom, and Equity are assembled.î and fragment 170: ìHaving put on the completely armed-vigour of resounding Light, with triple strength fortifying the Soul and the Mind, He must put into the Mind the various Symbols, and not walk dispersedly on the empyrÊan path, but with concentration.î] 3.52.- 4.14 4.15.- 4.30"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"JOHN ST.

I should explain first that I write this record for other eyes than mine, since I am now sufficiently sure of myself to attain something or other; but I cannot foretell exactly what form the attainment may take. Just so, if one goes to call upon a friend, he may be walking or riding or sleeping. Thus, then, is Adonai hidden from me. I know where He lives; I know I shall be welcome if I call; but I do not know whether He will invite me to a banquet or ask me to go out with him for a long journey. It may be that the Rota will give me some hint. [We have omitted the details of this divination.óED.] I am never content with such divinations; trustworthy enough in material concerns, in the things of the Spirit one rarely obtains good results. The first operation was rather meaningless; but one must allow (a) that it was a new way of dealing those cards for the opening of an operation; (b) that I had had two false starts. The final operation is certainly most favourable; we shall see if it comes true. I can hardly believe it possible. 6.10. Will now go for a stroll, get some milk, and settle down for the evening. 10.50. I regret to have to announce that on going across to the DÙme with this laudable intention, Nina brought up that red-headed bundle of mischief, Maryt Waska. This being in a way a ìbandobastî (and so inviolable), I took her to dinner, eating an omelette, and some bread and Camembert, and a little milk. Afterwards a cup of coffee, and then two hours of the vajroli-mudra1 badly performed. All this I did with reluctance, as an act of self-denial or asceticism, lest my desire to concentrate on the mystic path should run away with me. 1 [For the vajroli mudra see Siva Samhita IV 53-75. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCLX 14Therefore I think it may fairly be counted unto me for righteousness.

Some effort required; sweating appears to have stopped and bhuchari hardly begun. My head really aches a good deal. I must add one or two remarks. In my walk I discovered that my mantra Hua allahu, etc., really belongs to the viśuddhi-cakra; so I allowed the thought to concentrate itself there. [The viśuddhi-cakra: the ìnerve centre,î in Hindu mystic physiology, opposite the larynx.óED.] Also, since others are to read this, one must mention that almost from the beginning of this Working of Magick Art the changed aspect of the world whose culmination is the keeping of the oath ìI will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my soulî was present with me. This aspect is difficult to describe; one is indifferent to everything and yet interested in it. The meaning of things is lost, pending the inception of their Spiritual Meaning; just as, on putting one's eye to the microscope, the drop of water on the slide is gone, and a world of life discovered, though the real import of that world is not apprehended, until one's knowledge becomes far greater than a single glance can make it. 10.55.

I must really note the curious confusion in my mind between the viśuddhi-cakra and that part of the Boulevard Edgar Quinet which opens on to the cemetery. It seems an identity. In trying to look at the cakra, I saw that. Query: What is the connection, which appeared absolute and essential? I had been specially impressed by that gate two days ago, with its knot of mourners. Could the scene have been recorded in a brain-cell adjoining that which records the viśuddhi-idea? Or did I at that time unconsciously think of my throat for some other reason? Bother!

I have eaten my oysters, chewing them every one; also some bread and butter in the same manner, giving praise to Priapus the Lord of the oyster, to Demeter the Lady of corn, and to Isis the Queen of the Cow.

The prana seems equilibrated in the whole organism: I am very peacefulójust as a corpse is. It is terribly annoying, in a sense, because this condition is just the opposite of dhārana; yet one knows that it is a stage on the way to samādhi. So I rise and give confidently the Sign of Apophis and Typhon, and will then regard the reflection of the sweet October Sun in the kissing waters of the fountain.

Having got rid of Maryt (who, by the way, is Quite mad), and thereby (one might hope) of Apophis and Typhon, I perform the Great Ritual 671 with good results magically; i.e., I formulated things very easily and forcibly; even at one time I got a hint of the Glory of Adonai. But I made the absurd mistake of going through the Ritual as if I was rehearsing it, instead of staying at the Reception of the Candidate and insisting upon being really received.

How infinitely musical are the voices of Nature, those that are heard and those that are not heard! What Understanding of the Universe, what Love is the prize of him that hath performed all things and endured all things! The first operation of Ritual 671 is the preparation of the Place. There are two forces; that of Death and that of Natural Life.1 Death begins the Operation by a knock, to which Life answers. Then Death, banishing all forces external to the operation, declares the Speech in the Silence. Both officers go from their thrones and form the base of a triangle whose apex is the East. They invoke the Divine Word, and then Death slays with the knife, and embalms with the oil, his sister Life. Life, thus prepared, invokes, at the summons of Death, the forces necessary to the Operation. The Word takes its station in the East and the officers salute it both by speech and silence in their signs; and they pronounce the secret Word of power that riseth from the Silence and returneth thereunto. All this they affirm; and in affirming the triangular base of the Pyramid, find that they have mysteriously affirmed the Apex thereof whose name is Ecstasy. This also is sealed by that secret word; for that Word containeth All. Into this prepared Pyramid of divine Light there cometh a certain darkling wight, who knoweth not either his own nature, or his origin or destiny, or even the name of that 1 [Death is represented by the Hiereus, and Life by the Hegemon; they are identified with the Greek God-forms of Hades and Demeter, with Hermes and Iacchus for invisible stations. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCLX 32which he desireth. Before he can enter the Pyramid, therefore, four ordeals are required of him. So, bound and blinded, he stumbles forward, and passes through the wrath of the Four Great Princes of the Evil of the World, whose Terror is about him on every side. Yet since he has followed the voice of the Officer who has prepared him, in this part of the Ritual no longer merely Nature, the great Mother, but Neschamah (his aspiration) and the representative of Adonai, he may pass through all. Yea, in spite of the menace of the Hiereus, whose function is now that of his fear and of his courage, he goes on and enters the Pyramid. But there he is seized and thrown down by both officers as one unworthy to enter. His aspiration purifies him with steel and fire; and there as he lies shattered by the force of the ritual, he hearsóeven as a corpse that hears the voice of Israfelóthe Hegemon that chants a solemn hymn of praise to that glory which is at the Apex, and who invisibly rules and governs the whole Pyramid. Now then that darkling wight is lifted by the officers and brought to the altar in the centre; and there the Hiereus accuses him of the two and twenty Basenesses, while the Hegemon lifting up his chained arms cries again and again against his enemy that he is under the Shadow of the Eternal Wings of the Holy One. Yet at the end, at the supreme accusation, the Hiereus smites him into death. The same answer avails him, and in its strength he is uplifted by his aspirationóand now he stands upright. Now then he makes a journey in his new house, and perceives at stated times, each time preceded by a new ordeal and equilibration, the forces that surround him. Death he sees, and the Life of Nature whose name is Sorrow, and the Word that quickeneth these, and his own selfóand when he hath recognised these four in their true nature he passes to the altar once more and as the apex of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"JOHN ST.

Thus and not otherwise is he made a partaker of the Mysteries, and the Lightning Flash strikes him. The Lord hath descended from heaven with a shout and with the Voice of the Archangel, and the trump of God. He is installed in the Throne of the Double Kingdom, and he wields the Wand of Double Power by the sings of the grade. He is recognized an initiate, and the word of Secret Power, and the silent administration of the Sacrament of Sword and Flame, acknowledge him. Then, the words being duly spoken and the deeds duly done, all is symbolically sealed by the Thirty Voices, and the Word that vibrateth from the Silence to the Speech, and from the Speech again unto the Silence.

But scourging oneself is not easy with a robe on; and though one could take it off, there is this point to be considered: that one can never (except by a regrettable accident) hurt oneself more than one wants to. In other words, it is impossible thus to inflict pain, and so flagellants have been rightly condemned as mere volup-tuaries. The only way to do so would be to inflict some torture whose severity one could not gauge at the time: e.g., one might dip oneself in petroleum and set light to it, as the young lady mystic didóI suppose in Brittany!óthe other day. It's not the act that hurts, but the consequences; so, although one knows only roughly what will happen, one can force oneself to the act. This, then, is a possible form of self-martyrdom. Simi-larly, mutilations; though it is perhaps just to observe that all these people are mad when they do these things, and their standard of pleasure and pain consequently so different from the sane man's as to be incomprehensible. Look at my Uncle Tom! who goes about the world bragging of his chastity. The maniac is probably happy óa peacock who is all tail! And squawk.

I hope (by the way) that I have made it quite clear that all this time even a momentary cessation of active thought has been accompanied by the rising-up of the mantra. The rhythm, in short, perpetually dominates the brain; and becomes active on every opportunity. The liquid Moslem mantra is much easier to get on to than is the usual Hindu type with its m and n sounds predominating: but it does not shake the brain up so forcibly. Perhaps ítis none the worse for that. I think the unconscious training of the brain to an even rhythm better than startling it into the same by a series of shocks. I should like, to to remark that the suggestions in the ìHerb Dangerousî1 for a ritual seem the wrong way round. It seems to me that the Eastern methods are very arid, and chiefly valuable as a training of the Will, while the Ceremonies of the Magic of Light tune up the soul to that harmony when it is but one step to the Crown. The real plan is, then, to train the Will into as formidable an engine as possible, and then, at the moment in the Ritual when the real work should be done, to fling forth flying that concentrated Will ìwhirling forth with re-echoing Roar, so that it may comprehend with invincible Will ideas omniform, which flying forth from that one Fountain 1 [Published in Equinox I (2) as ìThe Psychology of Hashish.î]"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"JOHN ST.

I ought to have performed a true Equilibration by an hourís prānāyāma in āsana (even if I had to do it without kumbhaka) at midnight, dawn, noon, and sunset, and I should have allowed nothing in heaven above, or in earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth, to have interfered with its due performance. Instead I thought myself such a fine fellow that to get into āsana for a few minutes every midnight and the rest go-as-you-please would be enough. I am well punished. 8.30. This food, eaten in a yogī and ceremonial manner, is doing me good. I shall end, God willing, with coffee, cognac, and cigar. It is a fatal error to knock the body to pieces and leave the consciousness intact, as has been the case with me all day. It is true that some people find that if they hurt the body, they make the mind unstable. True; they predispose it to hallucination. One should use strictly corporeal methods to tame the body; strictly mental methods to control the mind. This latter restriction is not so vitally important. Any weapon is legitimate against a public enemy like the mind. No truce nor quarter! On the contrary, to use the spiritual forces to secure health, as certain persons attempt to do to-day, is the vilest black magic. This is one of the numerous reasons for supposing that Jesus Christ was a Brother of the Left-Hand Path. 1 [ChaldÊan Oracles, fragment 183 in Westcott edition; quoted by Proclus in his commentary on Platoís Parmenides.]"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"JOHN ST.

The one true self of me is Adonai. Simple! Yet I cannot remain in that simplicity. I got this ìrevelationî through the Egyptian plane, a partial illumination of the reason. It has cleared up the mind; but alas! the mind is still there. This is the strength and weakness both of the Egyptian plane, that it is so lucid and spiritual and yet so practical. When I say weakness, I mean that it appeals to my weakness; I am easily content with the smaller results, so that they seduce me from going on to the really big ones. I am quite happy as a result of my little ceremonyówhereas I ought to be taking new and terrible oaths! Yet why should Tahuti be so kind to me, and Asar Un-nefer so unkind?

It is true, by the way.

Some proofs to correct during the meal. 10.25. Having walked over to the studio reciting the Ritual (9.25-9.55 approximately), John St. John got into his pose, and began going for the gloves. The Interior Trembling began, and the room filled with the Subtle Light.

Later, the conscious man took heart and strove, though not so fiercely as before.

This he rejected ; and the Formless Ocean of White Brilliance absorbed him, overcame him; for he could not pass therethrough.

Have walked home, drunk a citron pressÈ at the DÙme, and prepare for the night. As I crossed the boulevard, I looked to the bright moon, high and stately in the east, for a message. And there came to me this passage from the Book of Abramelin: ìAnd thou wilt begin to inflame thyself in prayingî . . . It is the sentence which goes on to declare the Result. (P.S.óWith this rose that curious feeling of confidence, sure premonition of success, that one gets in most physical tasks, but especially when one is going to get down a long putt or a tricky one.

It is well that thus should close this eleventh day of my Retirement, and the thirty-third year of my life. Thirty and three years was this temple in building. . . .

Itís been a petty, peddling year. The one absolute indication is: on no account live otherwise than alone. But it is 10.35; these considerations, though in a way pertaining to the Work, are not the Work itself. Let me begin to inflame myself in praying! The Twelfth Day 12.17. When therefore I had made ready the chamber, so that all was dark, save for the Lamp upon the Altar, I began as recorded above, to inflame myself in praying, calling upon my Lord; and I burned in the Lamp that Pantacle which I had made of Him, renouncing the Images, destroying the Images, that Himself might arise in me. And the Chamber was filled with that wondrous glow of ultra-violet light self-luminous, without a source, that hath no counterpart in Nature unless it be in that Dawn of the North. . . . And there were revealed unto me certain Words of Power . . . And I invoked my Lord and recited the Book Ararita1 at the Altar . . . This holy inspired book (delivered unto me in the winter of last year) was now at last understanded of me; for it is, though I knew it not, a complete scheme of this Operation. For this cause I will add this book Ararita at the end of the Manuscript. [This has not been permitted. The Book 1 [ìLiber DCCCXIII vel Ararita sub figur‚ DLXX.î It had been privately printed in the 1909 first edition of Θελημα and was planned for general publication in vol. III of the Equinox; it was first generally published in a volume called The Holy Books (Dallas: Sangreal, 1969), bound up with Liber VII and Liber LXV, and again in Equinox III (9).]"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"LIBER DCCCLX 112Ararita will be issued by the A∴ A∴ in due course.óED.] I also demanded of mine Angel the Writing upon the Lamen of Silver; a Writing of the veritable Elixir and supernal Dew. And it was granted unto me. Then subtly, easily, simply, imperceptibly gliding, I passed away into nothing. And I was wrapped in the black brilliance of my Lord, that interpenetrated me in every part, fusing its light with my darkness, and leaving there no darkness, but pure light. Also I beheld my Lord in a figure and I felt the interior trembling kindle itself into a Kissóand I perceived the true Sacramentsóand I beheld in one moment all the mystic visions in one; and the Holy Graal appeared unto me, and many other inexpressible things were know of me. Also I was given to enjoy the subtle Presence of my Lord interiorly during the whole of this twelfth day. Then I besought the Lord that He would take me into His presence eternally even now. But He withdrew Himself, for that I must do that which I was sent hither to do; namely, to rule the earth. Therefore with sweetness ineffable He parted from me; yet leaving a comfort not to be told, a Peace . . . the Peace. And the Light and the Perfume do certainly yet remain with me in the little Chamber, and I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. For I am He that liveth, and was dead; and behold! I am alive for evermore, and have the Keys of Hell and of Death. I am Amoun the Sun in His rising; I have passed from darkness into Light. I am Asar Un-nefer the Perfected One. I am the Lord of Life, triumphant over death. . . .

After breakfast, have strolled, on my way to the studio, through the garden of the Luxembourg to my favourite fountain. It is useless to attempt to write of the dew and the flowers in the clear October sunlight. Yet the light which I behold is still more than sunlight.

It is the Infinite interior move-ment of things, secured by the co-extension of their sum with the all, that transcends the deadly opposites; change which implies decay, stability which spells monotony. I understand all the Psalms of Benediction; there is spontaneous praise, a fountain in my heart. The authors of the Psalms must have known something of this Illumin-ation when they wrote them. 9.30. It seems, too, that this Operation is transformed. I suppose it must read as a patchwork of most inharmonious colour, a thing without continuity or cohesion. To me, now, it appears from the very start a simple direct progress in one straight line. I can hardly remember that there were checks. Of course my rational memory picking out details finds otherwise. But I seem to have two memories almost as if belonging to two strata of being. In Qabalastic language, my native consciousness is now Neschamah, not Ruach or Nephesch. . . . I really cannot write more. This writing is a descent into Ruach, and I want to abide where I am. 11.17. At 10.0 arrived at Brennerís studio, and took the pose. At once, automatically, the interior trembling began again, and again the subtle brilliance flowed through me. The consciousness again died and was reborn as the divine, always without shock or stress. How easy is magic, once the way is found! How still is the soul! The turbid spate of emotion has ceased; the heavy particles of thought have sunk to the bottom; how limpid, how lucid is its glimmer.
