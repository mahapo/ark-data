This text of Liber Pyramidos is composited from the two main published versions (typeset with no source stated in Sothis magazine, St. Albans, 1976, and facsimile of illuminated MS. (presumably that referred to in ìJohn St. Johnî) in Equinox IV (1), Commentaries on the Holy Books, York Beach, Maine, 1996), and from a typescript which is believed to have been prepared from Crowleyís first draft manuscript. It makes no pretence at being a critical text; in any case the nearest thing I have to a primary source is the facsimile in the Equinox (one page of what appears to be the first draft MS. was irrelevantly included in the compilation O.T.O. Rituals and Sex Magick edited by P.R. Kˆnig and A.R. Naylor (Thame, Oxon.: I-H-O, 1999)). The one variant I will note here is that at the end of the ìHanged Manî section, the couplet ìThe three-fold star cross-crowned, I riseî appears only in the first draft MS. and the TS. made from it, and is omitted in all subsequent revisions. The title follows the Equinox printing, although the Sothis publication gives a similar title, following the surving TSS. The Word M . . . . M is believed to be MUAUM (the fourth dot and the yellow-green coloured band in the cipher represent a concealed yod which is not pronounced or counted in the enumeration: in Hebrew, \\wawm = 93). As far as I can tell it is pronounced with a steady outward breath, beginning with the lips closed, slowly opening the mouth to the maximum, then closing it again; it thus represents the complete course of the breath, and by analogy ìthe arising of the Speech from the Silence, and the return thereunto in the Endî (Liber 150). ~"}]
