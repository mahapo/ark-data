It is also a handbook for ceremonial invocation and for checking the validity of dreams and visions. It is indispendisble to those who wish to correlate these apparently diverse studies. It was published privately by Aleister Crowley in 1909, has long been out of print and is now practically unprocurable. Crowley, who had a phenomenal memory, wrote it at Bournemouth in a week without reference booksóor so he claimed in an unpublished section of his ìConfessions.îÜ It is not, however, entirely original. Ninety per cent of the Hebrew, the four colour scales, and the order and attribution of the Tarot trumps are as taught in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn with its inner circle of the Rose of Ruby and the Cross of Gold (R.R. et A.C.) This Order is still in existence, though it has changed its name and is dormant, for it no longer accepts probationers.á It was the * [This preface appeared in the 1955 first edition of 777 Revised and is believed to be by Gerald Yorke (Frater V.I.) who edited the revised edition. ó T.S.] Ü [Published in a slightly abridged form as The Confessions of Aleister Crowley edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant, London, Jonathan Cape, 1969; reprinted Harmandsworth, Penguin Arkana, 1989.

Yeats drank in their twenties. In this school they learned the traditional Western symbolism which coloured so much of their poetry and their thought. In it they were taught ceremonial magic, how to skry, and the technique for exploring the subtler realms of the mind on the so-called ìastral plane.î Crowley, however, was not content with the traditional qabalistic teaching of this Western Heremetic Order with its stress on magic and demonology. He travelled eastwards, becoming a fair Arabic scholar and studying the Mahommedan secret tradition under a qualified teacher in Cairo. Going on to India he learned the elements of Shaivite Yoga at the feet of Sri Parananda, who was Solicitor-General of Ceylon before he became a sadhu. In Southern India he studied Vedanta and Raja Yoga with ìthe Mahatma Jnana Guru Yogi Sabhapaty Swami.î He was thus qualified to equate the Hindu and Qabalistic systems. Allan Bennett, his friend and teacher in the Golden Dawn, had become the Burmese Buddhist bhikkhu Ananda Metteya. Crowley studied under him both in Ceylon and Burmah, and so was able to add the Hinayana* Buddhist columns to 777. Although he walked eastwards into China he never found a qualified teacher of Taoism or the Yi King. His attributions of the trigrams to the Tree of Life and his explanation of the hexagrams in Appendix I to 777 were based on Leggeís translation. Crowley was 32 when he wrote 777. Later as his knowledge and experience widened he became increasingly dissatisfied with it. He planned an enlarged edition which would correct a few errors, incorporate much new material, and bring the whole into line with The Book of the Law. He worked on this in the nineteen          even gone to the lengths of trademarking the name and emblems of the order).

What he did finish is published hereómost of it for the first time. The task of editing has been restricted for the most part to the omission of incomplete notes. The new material, which is marked with an asterisk in the Table of Contents, consists of an essay on the magical alphabet, a short note on Qabalah and a new theory on number. Then the more important columns in Table I are explained. These explanations include a few corrections and a number of important additions to the original Table. Those who wish to work with these Tables should extract the additions from the text, and add them to the appropriate lines of the column concerned.* Finally some new columns and ìarrangementsî have been included, partly from The Book of Thoth, and partly from holograph notes in Crowley's own 777. The editor has assumed that Crowley intended to incorporate these in the new edition. For the few interested in Gematria the numerical values of the Greek and Arabic alphabets have been added.Ü Crowley never completed 777 Revised, but he left enough material to justify its posthumous publication.

The sceptic will applaud our labours, for that the very catholicity of the symbols denies them any objective validity, since, in so many contradictions, something must be false; while the mystic will rejoice equally that the self-same catholicity all-embracing proves that very validity, since after all something must be true. Fortunately we have learnt to combine these ideas, not in the mutual toleration of sub-contraries, but in the affirmation of contraries, that transcending of the laws of intellect which is madness in the ordinary man, genius in the Overman who hath arrived to strike off more fetters from our understanding. The savage who cannot conceive of the number six, the orthodox mathematician who cannot conceive of the fourth dimension, the philosopher who cannot conceive of the Absoluteóall these are one; all must be impregnated with the Divine Essence of the Phallic Yod of Macroprosopus, and give birth to their idea. True (we may agree with Balzac), the Absolute recedes; we never grasp it; but in the travelling there is joy. Am I no better than a staphylococcus because my ideas still crowd in chains? But we digress.

Unluckily, the leading spirit in these latter societies1* found that his prayer, ìGive us this day our daily whisky, and just a wee drappie mair for luck!î was sternly answered, ìWhen you have given us this day our daily Knowledge-lecture.î Under these circumstances Daath got mixed with Dewar, and Beelzebub with Buchanan. But even the best of these systems is excessively bulky; modern methods have enabled us to concentrate the substance of twenty thousand pages in two score. The best of the serious attempts to systematise the results of Comparative Religion is that made by Blavatsky. But though she had an immense genius for acquiring facts, she had none whatever for sorting and selecting the essentials. Grant Allen made a very slipshod experiment in this line; so have some of the polemical rationalists; but the only man worthy of our notice is Frazer of the Golden Bough. Here again, there is no tabulation;2 for us it is left to sacrifice literary charm, and even some accuracy, in order to bring out the one great point. This: That when a Japanese thinks of Hachiman, and a Boer of the Lord of Hosts, they are not two thoughts, but one. The cause of human sectarianism is not lack of sympathy in thought, but in speech; and this it is our not unambitious design to remedy. Every new sect aggravates the situation. Especially the Americans, grossly and crapulously ignorant as they are of the rudiments of human language, seize like mongrel curs upon the * [Notes indicated by numbersódue to the present transcriberóare found at the end of this volume. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xiiiputrid bones of their decaying monkey-jabber, and gnaw and tear them with fierce growls and howls. The mental prostitute, Mrs. Eddy (for example), having in-vented the idea which ordinary people call ìGod,î christened it ìMind,î and then by affirming a set of propositions about ìMind,î which are only true of ìGod,î set all hysterical, dyspeptic, crazy Amurrka by the ears. Personally, I donít object to people dis-cussing the properties of four-sided triangles; but I draw the line when they use a well-known word, such as pig, or mental healer, or dung-heap, to denote the object of their paranoiac fetishism. Even among serious philosophers the confusion is very great. Such terms as God, the Absolute, Spirit, have dozens of connota-tions, according to the time and place of the dispute and the beliefs of the disputants. Time enough that these definitions and their inter-relation should be crystallised, even at the expense of accepted philosophical accuracy. 2. The principal sources of our tables have been the philosophers and traditional systems referred to above, as also, among many others, Pietri di Abano,3 Lilly, Eliphaz Levi, Sir R. Burton, Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu, Buddhist, and Chinese Classics, the Q ̇ran and its commentators, the Book of the Dead, and, in particular, original research. The Chinese, Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem and Egyptian systems have never before been brought into line with the Qabalah; the Tarot has never been made public. Eliphaz Levi knew the true attributions but was forbidden to use them.* All this secrecy is very silly. An indicible Arcanum is an arcanum that cannot be revealed. It is simply bad faith to swear a man to the most horrible penalties if he betray . . ., etc., and then take him mysteriously apart and confide the Hebrew Alphabet to his safe keeping.4 This is perhaps only ridiculous; but it is a * This is probably true, though in agreement with the statement of the traducer of Leviís doctrine and the vilifier of his noble personality."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"777 REVISED xivwicked imposture to pretend to have received it from Rosicrucian manuscripts which are to be found in the British Museum. To obtain money on these grounds, as has been done by certain moderns, is clear (and, I trust, indictable) fraud. The secrets of Adepts are not to be revealed to men. We only wish they were. When a man comes to me and asks for the Truth, I go away and practice teaching the Differential Calculus to a Bushman; and I answer the former only when I have succeeded with the latter. But to withhold the Alphabet of Mysticism from the learner is the device of a selfish charlatan. That which can be taught shall be taught, and that which cannot be taught may at last be learnt. 3. As a weary but victorious warrior delights to recall his battlesóFortisan hÊc olim meminisse juvabit*ówe would linger for a moment upon the difficulties of our task. The question of sacred alphabets has been abandoned as hopeless. As one who should probe the nature of woman, the deeper he goes the rottener it gets; so that at last it is seen that there is no sound bottom. All is arbitrary;Ü withdrawing out caustics and adopting a protective treatment, we point to the beautiful clean bandages and ask the clinic to admire! To take one concrete example: the English T is clearly equivalent in sound to the Hebrew t, the Greek t, the Arabic ت and the Coptic t, but the numeration is not the same. Again, we have a clear analogy in shape (perhaps a whole series of analogies), which, on comparing the modern alphabets with primeval examples, breaks up and is indecipherable. * [Lat. approx. ìperhaps it will be pleasant to remember these things one day.î] Ü All symbolism is perhaps ultimately so; there is no necessary relation in thought between the idea of a mother, the sound of the childís cry ìMa,î and the combination of lines ma. This, too, is the extreme case, since ìmaî is the sound naturally just produced by opening the lips and breathing. Hindus would make a great fuss over this true connection; but it is very nearly the only one. All these beautiful schemes break down sooner or later, mostly sooner."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xvThe same difficulty in another form permeates the question of gods. Priests, to propitiate their local fetish, would flatter him with the title of creator; philosophers, with a wider outlook, would draw identities between many gods in order to obtain a unity. Time and the gregarious nature of man have raised gods as ideas grew more universal; sectarianism has drawn false distinctions between identical gods for polemical purposes. Thus, where shall we put Isis, favouring nymph of corn as she was? As the type of motherhood? As the moon? As the great goddess Earth? As Nature? As the Cosmic Egg from which all Nature sprang? For as time and place have changed, so she is all of these! What of Jehovah, that testy senior of Genesis, that lawgiver of Leviticus, that Phallus of the depopulated slaves of the Egyptians, that jealous King-God of the times of the Kings, that more spiritual conception of the Captivity, only invented when all temporal hope was lost, that mediÊval battleground of cross-chopped logic, that Being stripped of all his attributes and assimilated to Parabrahman and the Absolute of the Philosopher? Satan, again, who in Job is merely Attorney-General and prosecutes for the Crown, acquires in time all the obloquy attaching to that functionary in the eyes of the criminal classes, and becomes a slanderer. Does any one really think that any angel is such a fool as to try to gull the Omniscient God into injustice to his saints? Then, on the other hand, what of Moloch, that form of Jehovah denounced by those who did not draw huge profit from his rites? What of the savage and morose Jesus of the Evangelicals, cut by their petty malice from the gentle Jesus of the Italian children? How shall we identify the thaumaturgic Chauvinist of Matthew with the metaphysical Logos of John? In short, while the human mind is mobile, so long will the definitions of all our terms vary."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"777 REVISED xviBut it is necessary to settle on something: bad rules are better than no rules at all. We may then hope that our critics will aid our acknowledged feebleness; and if it be agreed that much learning hath made us mad, that we may receive humane treatment and a liberal allowance of rubber-cores in our old age. 4. The Tree of Life is the skeleton on which this body of truth is built. The juxtaposition and proportion of its parts should be fully studied. Practice alone will enable the student to determine how far an analogy may be followed out. Again, some analogies may escape a superficial study. The Beetle is only connected with the sign Pisces through the Tarot Trump ìThe Moon.î The Camel is only connected with the High Priestess through the letter Gimel. Since all things whatsoever (including no thing) may be placed upon the Tree of Life, the Table could never be complete. It is already somewhat unwieldy; we have tried to confine ourselves as far as possible to lists of Things Generally Unknown. It must be remembered that the lesser tables are only divided from the thirty-two-fold table in order to economise space; e.g. in the seven-fold table the entries under Saturn belong to the thirty-second part in the large table. We have been unable for the moment to tabulate many great systems of Magic; the four lesser books of the Lemegeton,5 the system of Abramelin, if indeed its Qliphothic ramifications are susceptible of classification, once we follow it below the great and terrible Demonic Triads which are under the presidency of the Unutterable Name;6 the vast and comprehensive system shadowed in the Book called the Book of the Concourse of the Forces,7 interwoven as it is with the Tarot, being, indeed, on one view little more than an amplification and practical application of the Book of Thoth.8 But we hope that the present venture will attract scholars from all quarters, as when the wounded Satan leaned upon his spear,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xviiì Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run By angels many and strong,î and that in the course of time a far more satisfactory volume may result.

I, v. 57 includes the statement: ìAll these old letters of my Book are aright: but x is not the Star. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.î In Crowleyís ëNew Commentí on this verse, he observes: I see no harm in revealing the mystery of Tzaddi to ëthe wiseí; others will hardly understand my explanations. Tzaddi is the letter of The Emperor, the Trump IV, and HÈ is the Star, the Trump XVII. Aquarius and Aries are therefore counter-changed, revolving on the pivot of Pisces, just as, in the Trumps VIII and XI, Leo and Libra do about Virgo. This last revelation makes our Tarot attributions sublimely, perfectly, flawlessly symmetrical. The fact of its so doing is a most convincing proof of the superhuman Wisdom of the author of this Book to those who have laboured for years, in vain, to elucidate the problems of the Tarot. This substituted attribution is alluded to in various places in Liber Aleph and Magick in Theory and Practice, but was not spelt out in full in published writings until The Book of Thoth. The tables from 777 are based on the old Golden Dawn attributions; to work with the reversed attributions, lines 15 and 28 should be exchanged on all columns based on the Zodiac or Tarot (i.e., VI-VIII, XI, XIV-XX, XXII-XLVII, XLIX, CXXXVII-CLXXIV, CLXXVII-CLXXXIII and CLXXXVI), not all columns throughout as the editors of 777 Revised state ñ T.S."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 36 VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS* THE NAPLES ARRANGEMENT óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó 000 Ain =Zero Absolute. 00 Ain Soph =Zero as undefinable. 0 Ain Soph Aur =Zero as basis of possible vibration. óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó 1 Kether =The Point: positive yet indefinable. 2 Chokmah =The Point: distinguishable from 1 other. 3 Binah =The Point: defined by relation to 2 others. óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó The Abyss =between Ideal and Actual. óóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóóó 4 Chesed =The Point: defined by 3 co-ordinates.

COLUMN I: THE KEY SCALE In order to understand thoroughly the Key Scale, the student should have mastered the Essay on the Qabalah, (Equinox I (5), pp. 72-89), and acquainted himself with the use of Liber D (Equinox, I (8), Supplement).* It should be sufficient therefore in this place to explain simply the significance of the symbols of this scale. The numbers 000 to 10 are printed in heavy block type. They refer to the three forms of Zero and the ten Sephiroth or numbers of the decimal scale. The diagram shows the conventional geometrical arrangement of the symbols 1-10. The numbers 11-32 correspond to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. They are attributed to the paths which join the Sephiroth. Their arrangement is shown in the same diagram. 31 and 32 must be supplemented by 31-bis and 32-bis, as these two paths possess a definitely double attribution; viz. 31-bis to Spirit as against 31 to Fire; 32-bis to Earth as against 32 to Saturn. The numbers 11, 23, 31, 32-bis, 31-bis are printed close to the left edge of the column for convenience of reference, they referring to the 5 elements. 12, 13, 14, 21, 27, 30, 32 are printed in the centre of the column: they refer to the planets. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29 are printed on the right-hand edge of the column. They refer to the signs of the Zodiac. * [Both these texts were reprinted in The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley (later 777 and other Qabalistic Writings), the former under the spurious title ìGematria,î the latter in a slightly abridged form. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 60It should be understood that the main object of this book is to enable the student to do four things. Firstly, to analyze any idea soever in terms of the Tree of Life. Secondly, to trace the connection between every class of idea referring it thereto. Thirdly, to translate any unknown symbolism into terms of any known one by its means. Fourthly, to make a concatenation of any part of any idea with the rest by analogy with the similar concatenation of the Sephiroth and the paths. In this connection, observe that the numbers (of this column) subsequent to 10 are not to be considered as real numbers. The figures have been assigned to them arbitrarily for convenience only. Thus there is no special sympathy between 11 and the letter Aleph which is referred to it. For Aleph is connected chiefly with the idea of Zero and Unity, whereas 11 is the number of Magick, and its principal alphabetical correspondences are Beth and Teth. Further, the essential definition of a path is determined by its position on the Tree of Life as conductor of the influence of the Sephiroth which it connects. One great difficulty in constructing this table is caused by the intimate correspondency between certain Sephiroth and paths. Thus Kether is directly reflected into Chokmah according to one mode, and into Tiphareth according to another. Further, the creative energy on a still lower plane is symbolized in Yesod. In respect of its unity, moreover, it has its analogy in the 11th path. In the case of Chokmah the difficulty is even greater. Chokmah, as the creative energy Chiah, is of the same nature as Chesed, and even Tiphareth as Vau shows an intimate correspondence with the final HÈ of Tetragrammaton as Chokmah with her mother. Among the paths of the Serpent this creative energy is expressed according to various modes: by the 11th path, the Wandering Fool, who impregnates the King's Daughter, by the 12th path which creates Maya, the 15th which is definitely phallic,* and even the 13th which symbolizes change through putrefaction. Lastly, he is found in this function in the 27th path, which * [This is a probably a reference to the attribution of Aries and the Tarot Trump the Emperor to the 15th Path, as opposed to the later attribution of Aquarius and the Star. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 61represents Phallum Ejaculentem. Chokmah being pre-eminiently the causer of change. Again, Chokmah is the Logos, the messenger, the transmitter of the influence of Kether, and this is shown, in a lower mode, in the Sephira Hod. He is also implied in the 11th path, for the Fool also transmits the essence of Kether. He is in the 12th path as the Magician, Mercury, in the 16th as the Magus of the Eternal, in the 17th as the Oracle of the Mighty Gods, and in the 20th as the Prophet of the Eternal, the Magus of the Voice of Power.* The idea of the message is also implied in the 13th and 25th paths, perhaps even in the 32nd. The 18th path, too, conveys a certain quintessence although not in a Mercurial manner. And it is just these subtle distinctions which are vital to the proper understanding of the Tree of Life. The idea of Binah is even more complicated. Her darkness is referred to Saturn. As the Great Sea, she gives her nature to all those paths which contain the idea of the element of Water. Binah is connected with the Azoth, not only because the Azoth is the lower Moon, but because the Azoth partakes also of the Saturnian character, being the metal lead in one of the Alchemical systems. She is also the Great Mother. She is Venus and she is the Moon, and in each aspect she sheds her influence into very various paths. We need not here go further into the cases of the other Sephiroth. Now from a practical point of view of consturcting these tables, it will evidently be very difficult in many cases to choose on which path to place any given idea. It is obvious, for instance, that the Lotusówhich is also a Wheelómight be attributed to any path in respect ot its femininity. In some cases it has been necessary to give several attributions to the same thing. Observe in particular the 12 different aspects of Isis. The student must not attempt to use this book as if it were Molesworth. The whole idea of these tables is to supply him with very varied information, in such a form that he can build up in himself a scheme of the Universe in an alphabet, at once literary and * [These are Golden Dawn titles of the Tarot Trumps popularly known as the Hierophant, the Lovers and the Hermit respectively.

COLUMNS II, III: THE HEBREW NAMES OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS These columns indicate the principlal moral ideas connected with the Sephiroth. The names of the letters indicated rather the pictorial glyph suggests by the shape of the letter. But they also conceal a secondary meaning behind that of the numerical value and the number of the Tarot Trump of each. The value of the name of each letter modifies that meaning. For example, Aleph, while principally significant of Zero and Unity, explains itself further by the number 111, the value of the letters A L P. That is to say a study of the number 111 enables us to analyze the meaning of the number 1. It indicates, for instance, the trinitarian equation 1 = 3. Note that the letters HÈ and Vau may each be spelt fully in four different ways, corresponding to the four worlds given in column LXIV. It is to be thoroughly understood that the titles of the Sephiroth make no claim to give anything like a complete description of their nature. The glyphs of the 22 letters have some times a greater, some times a less, importance in elaborating the connotation. ALEPH means an Ox, principally because the shape of the letter suggests the shape of a yoke. There is also a reference to the mildness and patience of Harpocrates: indeed, to his sexual innocence. The function of ploughing is clearly the chief idea involved: herein lies a paradoxóto be studied in the last act of Parsifal. BETH is a House, the letter showing the roof, floor, and one wall. It is the dwelling place of man in the world of duality and illusion.

DALETH a Door, refers to the position of the path as joining Chokmah and Binah. It is the gate of the Supernals. Again, it is the letter of Venus and shows the sexual symbolism. The shape suggests the porch of a doorway, or a porched tent-flap. H... a Window, remindes us that Understanding (HÈ being the letter of the Mother in Tetragrammaton) is the means by which the Light reaches us. The gap between the two strokes is the window. VAU a Nail (shape directly hieroglyphic) suggests the fixation of the Supernals in Tiphereth. ZAYIN a Sword, refers to the attribution of the letter to Gemini, the sign corresponding to intellectual analysis. The Yod above suggests the hilt; that below, the blade. CHETH a Fence. The Cross-bar on the uprights suggests a fenceómore properly the Holy Graal. TETH is a Serpent, as is very obvious from the shape of the letter. The symbol of Leo also resembles the UrÊus. It being the house of the Sun, the idea is to emphasize the identity of the Star and the Snake. YOD a Hand, indicates the means of action. The doctrine is that the Universe is set in motion by the action of indivisible points (Hadit). The Hand being the symbol of creative and directive energy, is the polite equivalent of Spermatozoon, the true glyph. KAPH the Palmof the hand, is the hub of the wheel from whcih the force of the 5 elements spring. The reference is particulalry to Jupiter and the 10th ATU. The regular form may suggest the fist: the final, the open hand. LAMED an Ox-Gods, is once more principally a matter of shape. There is, in particular, a reference to the relation of Lamed with Aleph, a matter too profound to discuss in this place. It might be studied personally in the light of The Book of the Law and of essays thereon. MEM Water suggests a wave; a breaker by its initial or medial form,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 64and still water by its final form. In this single case, the actual meaning of the word is identical with the Yetziratic attribution of the letter. Note that the letter NUN, meaning fish, is not attributed to Pisces but to Scorpio. NUN a Fish, is that which lives and moves in the water: which is here a symbol of death. It therefore indicates the forces of Scorpio, generation through putrefaction. The final form suggests a tadpole. SAMECH a Prop, refers to the fact that the path connects Tiphereth with Yesod and therefore serves to connect Microprosopus with his foundation. The shape may suggest a pillow, or a stone, to be thrust under some object. A'AIN an Eye, refers to the meatus. This explains the application of Capricornus to the 15th ATU. The shape may suggest the two eyes and the nose. P... a Mouth, is explained by the shape of the letter. The Yod represents the tongue. TZADDI a Fish Hook, is also an obvious matter of shape. QOPH the Back of the Head. The shape is fairly suggestive. RESH a Head reversed. The seat of the human consciousness, which is Solar, pertaining to Tiphereth, is in the head. Resh is the Solar letter. In shape it is merely a big Yod, implying the brain as the expansion of the Spermatozoon. SHIN a Tooth, plainly exhibits the three fangs of a molar. It is also a glyph of the triple tongue of flame, the letter being referred to the element of Fire. The suggestion of devouring, eating, or eating into, is also given. The idea of the ternary shown by the three Yods is borne out by the value of the letter, 300. Yet the letter being one letter, the doctrine of the Trinity is implied. Hence its secondary attribution to the element of Spirit. It is also a glyph of the God SHU, whose head and arms, separating SEB and NUIT, form the letter. This connects it with the fire of the Last Judgement (ATU XX). I may here note that SHU is the God of air and not of fire, of the firmament that separates Earth and Heaven; so that the idea of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 65the letter is to establish a link between the ideas of fire and air, the two active elements. There is a similar connection between Mem and Tau. The 12th ATU shows a man hanging from a cross, which is the meaning of Tau. TAU a Tau or Crosssymbolizes the element of Earth aas a solidification of the four elements. There is also a phallic meaning, whence Tau is attributed not only to Earth, but to Saturn. Tau was originally written cruciform. I may supplement the above remarks by saying that they make clear that there is no such apodeictic connection between the letters as between the numbers. The meanings are in many cases little more than indications of certain lines on which meditation may be profitably pursued. COLUMN V: GOD NAMES IN ASSIAH 1. EHEIEH. The God names of the Sephiroth refer, for the most part, by meaning to their characteristics. Thus EHEIEH, pure existence, belongs to 1.

JEHOVAH ELOHIM gives the full name of the God, as if the Supernals were collected in Binah. 4. The name AL is used in many senses. Its deepest sense is give by The Book of the Law. The excuse for writing it here is that 4 represents Jupiter, the highest possible manifestion of Deity. 5. ELOHIM GIBOR. The attribution is natural. 6. JEHOVAH ELOAH VA-DAATH. The reference is to Tiphereth as the child of Chokmah and Binah, Da‰th (their first child) having failed to find a place on the Tree. 7-8.

ADONAI MELEKH. ìMy Lord the Kingî is the natural inhabitant of ìThe Kingdom.î The attributions of the Elemental Gods are somewhat arbitrary. Tetragrammaton is given to Air (11), because Jehovah is Jupiter, the Lord of Air. Al is given to Water (23), because of its attribution to Chesed, the Sephira of Water. Elohim is given to Fire (31) because the name of five letters represents the active but feminine principle Shakti of Geburah, the fiery Sephira. Adonai ha-Aretz is the natural title of Earth (32-bis); and Adonai is the name of God particularly referred to man in his mortality. It is one title of the Holy Guardian Angel. Yeheshua is attributed to Spirit (31-bis) on account of the formation of the word from Tetragrammaton by the insertion of the letter Shin, thus forming the Pentagram of the Elements. The planetary names refer to the sacred numbers of the planets. The Zodiacal signs are not honoured with God-names in the Hebrew system. Those referring to the planets ruling them may be used. COLUMN VI: THE HEAVENS OF ASSIAH This column gives the names of the astral or apparent phenomena corresponding to Column II. It must be understood that in speaking of the sphere of a planet the astrological attribution is a minor quasi-accidental and not necessarily reliable function. It depends on astrological theories. By ìTzedeqî we should understand any function of a phenomenon which partakes of the nature of Jupiter. At the same time the Heavens of Assiah do not refer directly to pure number but indirectly through the astrological and cosmographical conventions. 1. RASHITH HA-GILGALIM.

Uranus is attributed to Da‰th because of its explosive nature. The Abyss is represented in Nature by the Asteroids. There is another aspect of Uranus, the Magical Will, which is assigned to Chokmah. There is also another of Neptune, whose astrological characteristics are sympathetic with Neschamah and therefore with Binah. It must be remarked that since above the Abyss a thing is only true so far as it contains its contradictions in itself, the attributions of the planets above the Abyss cannot be so definite as those below. Each of them can in a way be attributed to any of the Supernals, and each may be given to any one for contradictory reasons. It cannot be too strongly pointed out to the practical Magician that when he comes to work with ideas above the Abyss, the whole character of his operations is completely changed. 3. SHABATAI represents Saturn as the planet of repose, of darkness, and perhaps as the category of Time. Note that Saturn is attributed to Da‰th in the hexagram of the planets. This is the creative Saturn, the hidden God, and the Da‰th of the apex of the upper triangle of the hexagram is in reality a concentration of the Trinity of the Supernals. The hexagram must not be like ìthe Stooping Dragon,î crowned with a falsity. 4. TZEDEQ means righteousness; the inexorable law of Jupiter. The connection of this with the number 4 depends on the aspect of 4 as the square of 2, the limitation of the Dyad further fixed by self-multi-plication, the introduction of a new dimension. 4 is thus a number of rigidity or materiality. Hence its ideal quality is inexorable righteous-ness. Yet in connection with this, remember that Chesed means Mercy and 4 is Daleth, the letter of Venus, Love. Consideration of this is very helpful in understanding the way in which a Sephira combines widely diverse ideas. 5-9. 5. MADIM. 6. SHEMESH. 7. NOGAH. 8. KOKAB. 9. LEVANAH.* 10. CHOLIM YESODOTH.

Ruach is also translated SpiritóLatin Spiritus. There must be no confusion between this \"spirit\" and that symbolized by the letter Shin. The distinctions are of the utmost importance, and so manifold and subtle that the subject demands a complete essay in itself. 23. MAIM is Hebrew for Water. 31. ASH is the Hebrew for Fire. 32 bis.

COLUMN VII: ENGLISH OF COLUMN VI The nature of the entries in this column is to be studied in the light of the traditional astrological conception. COLUMN VIII: ORDERS OF QLIPHOTH The titles of the Qliphoth, generally speaking, suggest the vice characteristic of the Sephira or other idea to which they are attributed. Thus the Thaumiel refer to Ketherm because their characteristic is to possess two contending heads, and so to deny the unity of Kether.

Thus, the sum of the first ten is fifty-five. Their significance has been well worked-out; and is important up to the number 13. After that, the numbers 15, 20, 21, 24, 28 and 31 have repaid the study bestowed upon them. For the meaning of the primes from 11 to 97 see page 132. COLUMN XI: THE ELEMENTS, WITH THEIR PLANETARY RULERS Kether is said to be the root of Air, because as the force of air, or the balance of Fire and Water, and, as connected, it is Aleph, with the ideas of Zero and Unity. Chokmah is said to be the root of Fire, because of its creative nature; Binah of Water, because of its receptive passivity, and its symbolism as the Great Sea. The three elements are refelcted into the second triad, Water being referred to Chesed, partly because it is the recipient of the male influence of the Supernals, partly because 4 is Daleth, Venus, the feminine or watery principle. The energy and mobility of Geburah naturally suggests Fire. The third member of the triad, Tiphereth, is Air,* partly for the same reason as Kether just cited, partly because Tiphereth is Microprosopus, who is Vau in Tetragrammaton, Vau being the letter of Air, the result of the union of Yod and HÈ, Fire and Water. In the third triad Netzach is Fire, as representing the devouring quality of love: Hod, Water, as representing the reflecting quality of thought: and Yesod, Air, on account of the extremely important mystery expressed in Liber 418, ∆thyr XI (see Equinox I (5), Supplement). The integrity of the Sephiroth is guaranteed by the fact that each one contains its contradictory in itself.

The three active elements are represented in three triads in a progressively diluted and impure form. There is a progressive admixture of ideas as one descends the Tree; but when the descent becomes so gross that they can no longer subsist as such, they unite to act as a trinity, to reproduce themselves by reflection or crystallisation as a fixed form in which their original natures are no longer perceptible as such. They merely modify the character of the compound. The analogy is to chemical elements, which are unable to manifest the natural property of the pure state in a compound. It is only their subtler qualities which influence the nature of the compound. Thus none of the physical properties of H. are directly to be observed in its combination with SO4. It is only the subtler qualities which determine that H2SO4 should be an acid. The attribution of Earth to Malkuth is important as explaining the nature of Nephesch and manifested matter. It is to be understood that the three active elements and the first 9 Sephiroth do not exist at all directly for the senses. They are to be apprehended only indirectly, by observing their function through determining the nature of sensible things. The necessary attributions* of this column are extremely important as throwing light on the nature of the Heavens of Assiah. They must be studied and meditated with great care. Thus the fiery signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius partake of the nature of Sol and Jupiter, because of the active, lordly, creative, paternal, generous, noble and similar qualities. The earthy signs are sympathetic with Venus and Luna because of the passive receptivity of those planets. Airy signs correspond particularly with Saturn and Mercury, because of the connection of these planets with thought. Watery signs are sympathetic with Mars with regard to the fact that Water possesses the fiery property of breaking up and destroying solids. The student must be careful to avoid expressing himself by inventing false * [The text at this point, following the printed edition, appears corrupt.

There is a great danger in arguing backwards in the Qabalah, especially in the case of attributions of this sort. Thus the explanation of the martial nature of water must not be used to argue a watery nature in Mars, whose natural sympathy is evidently Fire. It would be supremely misleading to try to obtain any information about the nature of Mars from this column. It is almost impossible to suggest any rule for avoiding errors of this sort. The best I can do is to recommend the student never to lose sight of the fact that all attributions whatsoever have no absolute quaility. The object is really to remind the student of what he already knows about any given idea and its relation with the rest. He should therefore determine for himself the nature of any idea principally by meditation or direct magical investigation, such as actual visions. He may accept provisionally the validity of correspondences so far as they indicate the best methods of invocation and evocation. Having thus firmly established in his head the correspondences of a symbol, he is less likely to misinterpret it, or to assign a new importance to any known correspondence such as is found in the latter part of this column. He will take the planetary rulers here given as little more than suggestions for memorizing minor details of the nature of the Zodiac. It would evidently be absurd to set up an antinomy between the statement in this column that Saturn and Mercury are the rulers of Libra with the statement elsewhere that Libra is ruled by Venus and Saturn exalted therein. There is, however, a certain partial sympathy between the columns. Thus Sol is exalted in Aries, Luna in Taurus, Mercury rules Gemini, and Sol Leo. In the case of Virgo, however, neither Venus nor Luna appear either as its ruler or as exalted therein. A profitable meditation might develop in some such way as follows:ó Question: Why should Venus and Luna not be given as rulers of Virgo? Virgo is suggested as the Virgin Isis, Luna as sympathetic with solitude, purity and aptitude for reflection of the Hermit, ATU IX. Venus, again, as Binah, the recipient of Wisdom, represents one aspect of Virgo. So too does the earthy"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 73nature of Venus in her aspect of Demeter. In this way an attribution, which at first sight is puzzling, may assist the student to harmonize many ideas which appear at first sight incompatible. The case of Venus is germane to the argument (note that the symbol of Venus is the only planetary symbol which includes all ten Sephiroth). Venus is astrologically used as a synthetic term for the feminine aspect of the Deity. She then has many parts, Vesta, Ceres, Cybele, Isis, etc. The main distinction to be borne in mind is that with Luna; and the task is all the more difficult in that the symbols continually overlap. It is by harmonizing and transcending such difficulties that the student arrives at a metaphysical conception which is perfectly positive and lucid on the one hand, and on the other emancipated from the bondage of the Laws of Contradiction. Luna = Gimel = 3. Trivia is one of the titles of Diana. The ife of woman is naturally divided into three parts: before, during, and after the age of menstruation. (1) The Virgin, (2) the Wife and Mother, (3) the Hag. In (3) the woman can no longer fulfil her natural functions, which therefore turn to the malignity of despair. Hence the identification of the Hag with the Witch. (1) is represented by Diana, the virgin huntress (legends of Atalanta, Endymion, Pan, Actaeon, Persephone, etc.), Hebe, Pallas Athene, Pythia and the Sybils, etc. The function of the virgin is inspirational. (2) is connected with Venus, Ceres, Cyble, Kwannon or Kwanseon, Sekhet, Hathor, Kali, Aphrodite, Astarte, Ashtoreth, Artemis of the Ephesians, and many other female deities. (3) is a wholly malignant symbol. HecatÈ and Nahema are the principal representatives of the idea. Note that there are certain demons of the nature of Venus Aversa, symbolical of the evil caused by distorting or suppressing this principle. Such are Echidna, Lilith, the outraged Aphrodite for the Hyppolytus, the Venus of the H ̄rsel in Tannh‰user, Melusina, Lamia, some aspects of Kali, Kundry, possibly the malicious side of Queen Mad and the Fairy nature generally."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 74The student is expected to have in mind all such symbols and to overcome their incompatibility, not be blurring the outline of the different figures, but by regarding each of them as representing one phenomenal manifestation of the ultimate principle which we name Nuit, Teh, Shakti, HÈ, Isis, positive electricity, the infinity of space, possibility, etc., in conjunction with a specific set of circumstances. The student will note that this principle cannot be apprehended in itself, but only in combination. Just so we can only understand electricity by observing its effects in lightning, magnetism, etc. Some philosophers have attempted to construct synthetic symbols to include all aspects of this principle. Thus the Egyptians, who were the most philosophical of all schools of Theogonists, included as many functions of femininity as possible in the idea of Isis. Thus she is:ó 1. Wisdom, like Pallas Athene. 2. The Physical Moon. 3. The Perpetual Virgin, twice-born with Osiris. 4. Nature (compelemented by her final form NephthysóPerfection). 5. The Builder of Cities. (As indicated by her head-dress). 6. The Spouse of Osiris. 7. The Mother of Horus. 8. The Spirit of Corn or food in general. 9. Earth in general. 10. The Goddess of Water or the Nile, and therefore of wine in general. She is the soul of intoxication, this represnting the spiritual rapture of physical love. 11. The Initiatrix; mistress of secrets. The Teacher. 12. The Restorer (the earth fertile after winter) as shown by her collecting the fragments of Osiris. The feminine nature is evidently coextensive with a moiety of all our ideas; and this fact alone is sufficient to account for the complexity of the symbolism. Hence the necessity for a course of meditation above indicated and for the occasional apparent contradictions."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 75COLUMN XIII: THE PATHS OF THE SEPHER YETZIRAH These attributions arise from the description of the paths in the Sepher Yetzirah. This is one of the most ancient books of the Qabalah; but it is far from clear how the ideas correspond with the general scheme of symbolism. They seem no use in practical magical work. It is doubtful whether the text of the book is accurate, or whether (in any case) the rabbin responsible for the text had sufficient authority.* COLUMN XIV: GENERAL ATTRIBUTIONS OF THE TAROT This column gives merely the actual attributions which are to be ataken as the basis of any investigation of the Tarot. They are the conventional terms and no more. COLUMN XV: THE KING SCALE OF COLOUR The four scales of colours (Columns XVñXVIII) are attributed to the four letters of Tetragrammaton. The King Scale represents the root of colour; that is, a relation is asserted between the essential significance of colour in the Atziluthic world, and that of the path understood as well as possible, in the light especially of Columns II, VI and XIV. But the King Sclae represents an essence of equal depth with the columns mentioned. It is an attribution of the same order as they; i.e. it is a primary expression of the essential ideas. 1. Brilliance represents the colourless luminosity of Kether. 2. The blue is that of the sky (Masloth). 3. The crimson represents blood. Compare the symbolism of the Scarlet Woman and her Cup in Liber 418. 4. The deep violet is episcopal. It combines 2 and 3, a bishop being the manifestation of heavenly or starry existence manifested through the principle of blood or animal life. * [The text ìThe 32 Paths of Wisdomî from which the titles in Col. XIII were taken is not an intrinsic part of the Sepher Yetzirah, rather is believed to be a mediÊval appendix to it. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 765. The orange suggests the energy as opposed to other qualities of the Sun. 6. The rose is that of dawn. The attribution therefore asserts the identity of the Sun and Horus and is thus implicated with the doctrine of the New ∆on. 7. Amber represents the electric voluptuousness of Aphrodite. It suggests the tint of the skin of those women who are most enthusiastically consecrated to Venus. 8. Violet-purple. Should this not be lavender? Meditate. 9. The indigo is that of the Akasa (ether) and of the throat of Shiva. It represents the night sky blue of the nemyss of Thoth. This nemyss is the mysterious yet pregnant darkness which surrounds the generative process. 10. The yellow indicates Malkuth as the appearance which our senses attach to the solar radiance. In other words, Malkuth is the illusion which we make in order to represent to ourselves the energy of the universe. THE ELEMENTAL COLOURS These may be naturally derived from what has been said about Column XI, lines 1-10. Scarlet naturally represents the activity of Fire, blue the passivity of Water, while yellow is the balance between them. Green is the middle colour of the spectrum and therefore the balanced receptacle of the totality of vibration. Observe that the complementary of each of the pair of the colours of the active elements is the third. Thus red and blue make violet, whose complementary is yellow; and so on. For the citrine, olive, russet, and black of earth, see the explanation under 10, Malkuth, in the Queen Scale (Column XVI). The pure earth, known to the ancient Egyptians in that Equinox of the Gods over which Isis presided, was green. THE PLANETARY ATTRIBUTIONS They follow the colours of the spectrum. They are the transparent as opposed to the reflected colours. They follow the order of the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 77subtlety and spirituality of the vibration. Thus the violet of Jupiter is definitely religious and creative, which at the end of the scale the red of Mars is physical, violent and gross. Between these we have Saturn whose indigo represents the sobriety and deep-sea calmness of meditation, Saturn being the eldest of the Gods. Luna is blue; representing purity, aspiration and unselfish love. The green of Venus suggests the vibration of vegetable growth. It is the intermediate stage between the definitely spiritual and the definitely intellectual and emotional type of vibration. In the \"rods and cones\" attribution green is the central colour, the pure passivity absorbing all: as Venus combines all the Sephiroth in one symbol. The yellow of Mercury suggests the balanced but articulate movement of the mind. The orange of Sol is the intense but gross physical vibration of animal life. The above represents merely one of an indefinitely large number of interpretations which may be derived from meditation on this attribution. THE ZODIACAL ATTRIBUTIONS The Zodiacal colours proceed systematically from the Scarlet of Aries to the violet of Aquarius. The colour which completes the circle is described as crimson, and is attributed to Pisces, the allusion being to the relation of Pisces with Binah through the ATU XVIII, the Moon, in which also is shown the pool of midnight through which Kephra travels in his bark; and this suggests the Night of Pan which hangs over the City of the Pyramids. Aries is scarlet, being the House of Mars and the sign of the Spring Equinox, where occurs the fiery outburst of the new year. Taurus is red-orange, suggesting the red earth of which man (who is Taurus, Vau, Microprosopus, the Son) is made, the orange indicating the Solar influence and the energy of Geburah. Gemini is orange, since ATU VI shows the Solar twins Vau HÈ. Cancer is amber, the connection being with Netzach, Venus in her less spiritual form being the chariot or vehicle through which the influence of the Supernal Mother is conveys to man.

The ideas of love and electricity are implicit in this sign, which is ruled by the Moon and in which Jupiter is exalted. Leo is pure yellow, yet with that tinge of green which is characteristic of the purest gold. It suggests the first form of the principle of vegetable growth, implicit in the nature of the Solar ray. Virgo has the yellowish green of young grass. The connection is evident. Libra is emerald green, being pre-eminently the house of Venus. Scorpio is the greenish blueóPrussian blueówhose psychological effect upon the sensitive mind is to suggest a poisonous or putrafactive vibration. It contains the idea of life and death interpenetrating each other and reproducing each other continuously; always with the accompaniment of a certain morbid pleasure. It is the identification which one finds in Swinburneís best poems: ìThe Garden of Proserpine,î ìDolores,î ìIllicet,î ìAnactoria,î and others. The natural correspondence is the blue-green sea.* Sagittarius is blue; being the House of Jupiter, which is blue in the Queen Scale. It is also the blue of the sky, for Sagittarius is the background of the Rainbow symbolism of Q Sh Th. It is further connected with the blue of religious aspiration. It continues the path of Gimel. It is the aspiration from Yesod to Tiphereth as Gimel is from Tiphereth to Kether. Note that the aspiration from Malkuth is dark blue: it being so low on the Tree its purity is to some extent darkned. Capricornus is indigo. The connection is with the colour of Yesod, implying the sexual symbolism of the Goat. Aquarius is violet: this is connected with ATU XVII. Cf. The Book of the Law, I, 61-64. The colour violet, generally speaking, signifies a vibration which is at the same time spiritual and erotic; i.e. it is the most intense of the vibrations alike on the planes of Nephesch and Neschamah.

(Spectra.) 1-3. In this scale, therefore, we read the appearance of the 32 paths as they are found in Nature. Kether, being previously unconditioned brilliance, is now articulate as white. The grey of Chokmah refers to the cloudy appearance of semen, and indicates the transmission of white to black. It is the double nature of the Dyad. Binah is black, having the faculty of absorbing all colours. In the three Supernals, therefore, we find the 3 possible modifications of light, in its wholeness. Above the abyss there is no separation into colour. 4. Chesed has the blue of water 5. Geburah has the red of fire. 6. Tiphereth the yellow of air.

The colours of the 3rd triad are derived from those of the 2nd by simple admixture. 7. Netzach. Emerald is Chesed and Tiphereth mingled. It is also the colour of Venus. 8. Hod.

Emerald represents the most brilliant aspect of Venus; orange that of Mercury. Violet of the very complex formula synthesizes Yesod in the idea of Luna. Note that Sol and Luna are direct images of the masculine and feminine principles, and much more complete Macrocosms than any other planets. This is explained by their symbols in the Yi King, 5 and 2.

Just as the third Triad combines the colours of the second Triad by pairs, so does Malkuth in a yet more complete manner. Citrine combines blue, red and yellow with a predominance of yellow; olive, with a predominance of blue; ruesset, with a predominance of red; and these represent respectively the airy, watery, and fiery sub-elements. Black is the earthy part of Earth. But here we observe a phenomenon compatible with that found in the Tarot, where the four Empresses (symbolical of HÈ final) are the throne of the Spirit as well as being the ultimate recipients of the force of King, Queen, and Emperor. The black is the link between the lowest conception, the climax of the degeneration of pure colour in the final assimilation of light, and the black of Binah. It is the lowest part of the daughter which contains in darkness the identity with the Pure Mother, to set her upon whose throne is one definite image of the Great Work. See also the 27th Symbol in Liber XXVII;* the ultimate of the feminine symbols, the complete dissociation of existence, the final disappearance of all positive ideas, but this is found to be essentially identical with the perfection of the continuum.Ü The planetary colours are connected chiefly with the sacred metals as observed clairvoyantly, or considered in respect of their astrological and alchemical character. Mercury is purple suggesting the iridescence of quicksilver and the blue of Mercury vapour. Luna is silver, the apparent colour of the Moon in the sky, and of the metal to which she is attributed. Venus is sky-blue; this is possibly a reference to copper sulphate, an important salt in alchemy; but principally because sky-blue naturally suggests the more frivolous aspects of love. The blue of Jupiter refers to the blue of the sky, his dominion, and to the appropriate colour of religious aspiration.

Sol is yellow, the apparent colour of the sun, and of the metal gold. Saturn is black with reference to Binah, the sphere of Saturn, to the Night of Pan (see Liber 418 in Equinox I, 5), to the blackness of oblivion (Saturn being Time), and to the blackness of the Tamoguna, Saturn representing the inactivity of old age. Zodiacal colours are less obvious in their attribution. In fact it will be best to take this part of the column for what it may be worth as an uninitiated tradition. I am myself unable to attach any serious and important meaning to the majority of the symbols. At most, one can say that the colour of the scale represennts the degeneration of the Key Scale. E.g. in the case of Aries, red represents a mere dulling of the previous scarlet. The deep indigo of Taurus suggests the laborious sadness of the brute part of man; the slate-green of Virgo may refer to the apparent ennui or colourless melancholy of the hermit life. The black of Capricorn refers to the popular idea of ATU XV; while the attribution of Pisces may refer to the actual appearance of some fish, or to certain phenomena characteristic of the astral plane. COLUMN XVII: THE EMPEROR SCALE The scale of the Emperor is derived from the two previous scales by simple admixture, as of colours on a palette for the most part. COLUMN XVIII: THE EMPRESS SCALE The scale of the Empress is, generally speaking, either a degeneration from the scale of the Emperor or a complementary attribution, HÈ being the twin of Vau. But in each case there is an added brightness whose source must be discovered by meditation. This brightness is a phenomenon compatible to that described above in connection with the Empresses being the thrones of the Spirit, and Malkuth being the extreme departure from the perfection of the Supernals, and so the link through which the redemption of the whole complex substructure below the Abyss may be accomplished."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 82The colours of the Empress Scale are combinations of two or more colours. The best may be considered as derived from the three previous scales, and the flecks or rays as representative of the bridegroom who is appointed to bring the Empress to perfection thus. 1. White flecked gold. The white is a reflection of the white brilliance of Kether; but the gold is an ornament, and thus indicates the mystery of the Holy Guardian Angel, who finds added perfection when invoked by his client, the gold of Tiphereth. 2. Red, blue, and yellow are the results of the creative energy of Chokmah and their white basis significes that Chokmah has been perfected by fulfilling his function in this way. Also, the robe of the perfected Osiris is white flecked with red, blue, and yellow. 3. As the grey of Chokmah was perfected to the white of Kether, so the black of Binah is perfected to the grey of Chokmah. The grey is flecked with the pink of Tiphereth. This is the dawn of the child with which she is heavy, for this is the symbol of her perfection. 4. Deep azure represents Jupiter and Water. It is flecked with yellow. This represents religious meditation; the yellow flecks are the first marks of ecstasy. 5. Red is the most passive shade of the scarlet of the two former scales. The black flecks show that in its perfection it receives the influence of Binah, the Supernal immediately above it in the Tree. 6. Gold amber suggests the mellowness of harvest, which is the perfection of the rose-pink of dawn, the spring of the day. 7. There seems a possible reference to Semele; and the general idea is that Netzach has been brought to a quiet harmonious tone and is receiving the influence of Tiphereth. Olive flecked gold. 8.

It has, so to speak, made good its position above the Abyss. It is adorned with the blue rays of the King Scale of Chokmah.

MINUTUM MUNDUM A General Note on Columns XV-XVIII, the Four Scales of Colour You can use the four scales of colour as you choose. The only thing to remember is the attribution, the Tetragrammaton. The Sephiroth are given in the Kingís Scale and the paths in the Queenís Scale* in accordance with the general law of balance. You must never have a masculine sticking out by itself without a feminine to equilibrate it. The Sephiroth are definitely positve ideas. The numbers are ìThings in Themselves,î much more so that the letters of the alphabet. The paths are merely the links between the Sephiroth. Of course the idea of balance is carried into the Sephiroth themselves. The number 4 is masculine in its relation with number 5, feminine in its relation with number 3. You cannot go wrong as long as you keep always this idea of balance in the forefront of your mind. Whenever one thing goes on to another thing, there must always be this opposition, and equilibrium. You can apply this to every point that comes up in practical working. It is always possible to refer any system of symbols to the Tree of Life merely by Tetragrammaton, or indeed to any of the fundamental systems of classification. It is a very useful exercise to practice this type of analysis. Take, for example, the letter Daleth, and note all is correspondences. For instance, you get at once the equation 4 = 7, for the numerical of Daleth is 4, while 7 is of Venus. * [The other way round is more usual. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 86The more thoroughly you practice this the nearer you will come to the completely automatic subconscious understanding of the essence of any given symbol. COLUMNS XIX, XX, XXI, XXXIV, XXXV: GENERAL REMARKS ON THE GODS Many of the so-called names of God, such as the 99 names of Allah and the poetical lists of Hinduism, are not really names at all but descriptive titles. By the true name of a God we mean that word which represents his Magical Formula: the due process of which therefore sets his energy in motion. (See J.G. Frazer for numerous legends illustrating this idea.)* There cannot therefore be more true names ultimately than distinct sounds. For a God with a compound name would represent a complex sound, and therefore a complex energy. Such a God would lack the simplicity which is the first attribute of Godhead. Outside the Hebrew and such other names of Gods as can be checked and corrected if necessary by the rules of Gematria, or the Yetziratic or Tarotic attribution, there is no adequate security that corruption has not taken place, e.g. Osiris instead of Asar; Jupiter instead of IAO-Pater. There are numerous dialectic changes, and changes due to corruption in the course of time or to deliberate modification, with such ends in view as the identification of a local deity with an important and popular God of similar name. The uncertainty of primitive alphabets is responsible for mispronunciations, which are then written down phonetically and again mispronounced, so that in course of time one finds a form which cannot be recognised; e.g. confusion has arisen from the writing of the sound S with a C, pronouncing the C hard and then (to avoid mistakes!) replacing it by K. There is also confusion between I or Y and J (Dj), soft G and hard G, so that a name originally pronounced with a Y ends by appearing with a hard G. * [Taboo and the Perils of the Soul, cap. VI ß 5.]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 87The popularity of a Deity lends to his or her identification with the local interests of each new groups of worshippers. Thus a corn goddess might appeal, for one reason or another, to town-dwellers, who would then acclaim her as especially protectress of cities. The process in its widest possibilities is practically universal in the case of those divinities whose cult covers any considerable variety of climates, cultures, economic and social conditions and centuries. Thus a primitive God may be worshipped under a corruption of his original name, and also by his original character. The evolution of Gods proceeds pari passu with that of their devotees. From this it will be clear that except in the case of the Hebrews and of a few isolated instances, it is almost impossible to decide on a satisfactory attribution for any given name. It is only when the cult of the god is limited so that his symbolic form, attributes and legend have some single or at least predominant characteristic, that one can make use even of correctness, much less of completeness. Such is Sekhet, who is uniformly represented with a lionís head and described as possessing feline qualities, so that we can assign her to Leo without hesitation. But a goddess like Isis might be given to Zero as co-terminous with Nature, to 3 as Mother, to 4 as Venus, to 6 as Harmony, to 7 as Love, to 8 as the Moon, to 10 as Virgin, to 13 again as the Moon, to 14 as Venus, to 15 as connected with the letter HÈ, to 16 as the Sacred Cow, to 18 as Goddess of Water, to 24 as Draco, to 28 as Giver of Rain, to 29 as the Moon, and to 32 as Lady of the Mysteries (Saturn, Binah). In such cases one must be content with a more or less arbitrary selection, and make an independent investigation in each particular case in reference to the matter immediately under consideration. The complementary confusion is that Deities of very different nature will appear against the same rank of the Key Scale for different reasons. For instance, the number 4 includes both Isis and Amoun. There is no question of identifying these. The fact of their appearing in the same place must be taken to indicate that both ideas are necessary to complete the connotation of the number 4.

THE PLANETS These attributions are all obvious. It is, in fact, largely on the mythological and astrological conception of these Gods and Goddesses that the intelligibility of this whole Table is based. They represent the fundamental familiar ideas. 30. Ops, God of Wealth, which is solar. 32. Terminus, because Saturn is the end of things.

Venus, Lady of Taurus. Hymen is given here because of its connection with ATU V. See Catullus, Pervigillium Veneris. 17. Twin Gods. Hymen as relating to ATU VI. 18. Mercury is here attributed because the path of Cancer leads from the Supernal Binah to Geburah. This is a reference to ATU VII. But this attribution is very doubtful. The bearer of the Graal is not Hermes the Mesenger. The Lares and Penates are given as Gods of the Home, Cancer being the sign of receptivity and settlement; but again this attribution is not altogether satisfactory. 19. ATU XI may be regarded as representing the Fire of Vulcan. 20. Vesta, the Virgin Goddess. Ceres, Flora and Adonis are given here because of their connection with spring, which is suggested by the yellowish-green colour in the King Scale. 22. A Goddess of Justice might be attributed here but in the higher sense of the Eighth ATU, the main idea is that of the satisfied woman; we might therefore insert Venus which rules Libra.

Neptune, because Pisces is a watery sign. COLUMN XXXVIII: ANIMALS, REAL AND IMAGINARY 0. The Dragon represents Draco connected with Nuit in the Heaven; Ananta, the great serpent which surrounds the Universe. It devours its own tail, thereby reducing it to Zero. 1. The Swan as representing Aum. See Liber LXV, Cap. II, 17-25. See also The Book of Lies, Cap. XVII. The Hawk pertains to Kether, as poised in the ether and beholding all things. Remember that Kether is primarily the individual point of view. The Soul beholds all things and changes the place according to its going. Thus in the Egyptian tradition the Hawk is the symbol of the highest type of Godhead. 3. The Bee is the traditional attribution of the Yoni. 4. Again, traditional. It is probably connected with the erect phallus of Amoun. The Unicorn is also Jupiterean, as connected with the horse of Sagittarius. 5. The Basilisk represents Geburah on account of its power of slaying with the flame of its glance. 6. The Phoenix on account of its symbolism of the 5∞=68 grade. Lion, as the typical animal of Sol. Child, as Vau of Tetragrammaton. The Spider is particularly sacred to Tiphereth. It is written that she ìtaketh hold with her hands and is in kingsí palaces.î* (The most characteristic title of Tiphereth is the ìPalace of the King.î) She has six legsÜ and is in the centre of her web exactly as Tiphereth is in the centre * [Proverbs, XXX. 28.] Ü [Only because youíve pulled two off, Aleister.

All carrion birds may be attributed here, because of their connection with Victory. Note that the path of Scorpio connects Tiphereth with Netzach. The idea of Venus is intimately connected with that of death, for death is in many important senses a part of love. Compare the Book of Lies, Caps. I, VIII, XV, XVI, and XVIII, etc., etc. 8.

The Cynocephalos is the constant companion of Thoth and produces base imitations of his Wisdom and Power. The Twin Serpents for the same reason as in line 8. All fish are sacred to Mercury because of their swiftness, their cold-bloodedness, the gleaming white or iridescent colours which are characteristic of their scales, and to some extent to their method of reproduction. Hybrids may also be attributed here, as to line 17. 13. The Dog, as baying at the Moon and the natural companion of the huntress Artemis. The white Stork, perhaps as traditionally announcing childbirth. The Camel as the actual meaning of the letter. It conveys travellers across the desert as the path of Gimel crosses the Abyss from Tiphereth to Kether. See also Book of Lies, Cap. XLII. 14. The Sparrow and Dove are especially sacred to Venus.

The Swan, for the same reason as above. The Sow, the female of the boar of Mars; also because the sensuality of the sow suggests the lower type of Venus. All birds are primarily sacred to Venus, probably because the instinct of love enables a man to rise for a sime above the earth. Also because of their great beauty of form and colour, because their flesh is tender as compared to that of aniamls, and because there speech is of the nature of ecstatic song and is devoid of any intellectual quality. 21. The Eagle is the sacred bird of Jupiter. The Praying Mantis suggests Jupiter by its simulation of a devotional attitude. 27. The Horse is sacred to Mars chiefly on account of his spirited nature. The Bear is martial chiefly for alchemical reasons and because of his great strength. The Wolf is sacred to Mars (see the legend of Rome), also on account of his savage nature. The Boar is martial, as shown in the legend of Adonis. There is here a mystery of the grade of 6∞=58, the overawing of Tiphereth by Geburah. 30. The Lion is the typically solar animal. The Hawk is solar as all-seeing. The Leopard is sacred to the sun on account of its black spots. 31. The Crocodile is Saturnian, as the devourer. THE ZODIAC 15. The Ram is Aries by meaning. The attribution refers to his attitude of combatively butting. Note that the symbolism of the lamb is by no means the same. It pertains rather to Tiphereth in the formula of the ∆on of Osiris. This is all probably derived from the fact that lamb is the tenderest meat obtainable and therefore the priests insisted on lamb being sacrificed for their benefit. The true nature of the Lamb would be rather Venusian or Lunar, but it would be better to cut it altogether out of the symbolic scheme, because of the priestly connection which the idea has suffered. The Owl is sacred to Aries as the bird of Minerva. 16. The Bull is the Kerub of Earth. All beasts of burden and those used in agriculture may be attributed here."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 9817. All animals of dual nature in any respect pertain partly to Gemini. The Magpie is especially sacred to this sign because of its piebald plumage and its power of speech. The Parrot is given here for similar reasons. The Zebra is here on account of its stripes. All hybrids pertain to Gemini, both on account of their dual nature and because they are sterile like Mercury. The Penguin is here as superficially imitating man. 18. The Crab pertains to Cancer as the translation of the word. The Turtle is found among the symbols of the Court Cards of the suit of Cups. The Whale suggests Cancer because of its power of blowing water, and its faculty, in incorrect tradition, of swallowing large objects such as prophets. All beasts of transport may be attributed here in reference to ATU VII. 19. Leo means Lion and is the Kerub of Fire. The Cat is of the Lion family, so also is the Tiger. The Serpent is given to Leo because the letter Teth means Serpent. There is an important mystery concealed in ATU XI, and Woman may be attributed to Leo in respect to her sexual ferocity through which she dominates Man; that is, the lower element in Man, especially his courage as represented by the Lion. 20. All animals which go solitary are attributed here, as also those which refuse to unite with others. This is connected not only with ATU IX but with the cold-bloodedness of Mercury. The Rhinocerosóthe single horn suggests Mercury, line 8. In the Dhammapada he is taken as the emblem of the Hermit. 22. The Elephant is given to Libra because equilibrium is the basis of the Universe. The symmetry of any animal is of the nature of Libra, and so we may place in this group any animals which make symmetrical patterns; as, for instance, the Spider (see line 6). But even the Spiders which live in the earth build their houses with a great regularity. 24. Scorpio means Scorpion. The Beetle is given to Scorpio chiefly on account of the peculiar colour (see the Empress Scale, Column XVIII) and partly because of certain habits, such as its transmutation through putrefaction. All reptiles may be placed here for this reason."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 99The Lobster and Crayfish are, so to speak, water scorpions. The Shark is one of the most martial inhabitants of the sea. The Crablouse refers to Scorpio both by nature and habitat. 25. The Centaur is traditionally connected with Archery, besides being partly a horse; the horse itself is connected with the idea of hunting and speed. Note that the speed of Sagittarius, which is the flickering of a dying fire, is not to be confused with the speed of Mercury, which is the speed of thought or electricity. The Hippogriff combines the Horse of Mars with the Eagle of Jupiter. The Dog is sacred to the huntress Artemis. 26. Capricornus means Goat. The Ass and the Oyster are traditionally sacred to Priapus. An animal is sacred to Capricorn in respect of its ambition, actual or symbolic. It is the leaping of the Goat and its fondness for high and barren mountains which connect it with Capricorn, the sign which represents the zenith in the Zodiac. Note that the sexual instinct should primarily be regarded as indicative of the ambition or aspiration of the animal to higher things. 28. See line 11 for the first attribution. The Peacock is the bird of Juno as Lady of Air and especially Aquarius, but the Peacock might also be referred to Tiphereth or even to Mercury and Sagittarius on account of its plumage. The vision of the Universal Peacock is connected with the Beatific Vision, in which the Universe is perceived as a whole in every part, as the essence of joy and beauty; but in its diversity this is connected with the symbolism of the Rainbow, which refers to the middle stage in Alchemical working, when the Matter of the Work takes on a diversity of flashing colours. This, however, is connected not so much with the nature of Sagittarius in itself as an isolated constellation, but with its position on the Tree of Life as leading from Yesod to Tiphereth. Samekh must therefore be regarded in this matter as the threshold of Tiphereth, even as Gimel is the threshold of Kether, and Tau of Yesod. These three, therefore, constitute the three main balanced spiritual experiences in the way of attainment. 29. Pisces means Fish, but, as previously indicated, actual fish do"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 100not belong here so much as to Mercury. The Dolphin pertains to Pisces, principally because Venus is exalted in the sign, while its ruler, Jupiter, is also implied in that attribution of which we see the outcome in the title of the Heir-apparent to the Crown of France. The Beetle is Kephra, the Sun at mightnight, who is shown travelling through the Pool of Night in ATU XVIII. Pisces, moreover, is that greatest darkness before the dawn of the year in the parallel symbolism. There is also a mystery in the fact that the Beetle rolls up of ball of dung, thus constructing the Sun from the excrement of putrefaction. As it is written, ìIt is from the excrement of Choronzon that one takes the material for the creation of a God.î* The Jackal is shown in ATU XVIII. He also feeds on excrement. The sign Pisces represents the apparent stagnation of the Work, its final decomposition. And it is at this moment that it is brought by the Redeemerówho has descended into the lowest hell for the purposeóacross the threshold into the higher sphere. Note that it is because of the condition of the experiment that the Work necessarily lends itself to every form of glamour and illusion. Its nature is certain to be misinterpreted even by the Redeemer himself, insofar as he is compelled to fix his attention upon the Matter of the Work and so to lose sight for the moment of the essential Truth which underlies its appearances. The Dog is attributed to Pisces on account of his being sacred to the Moon, the title of ATU XVIII. The Dogs baying at the Moon, with the accompanying assumption of witchcraft and all that type of phenomena which we associate with the treacherous semi-darkness of the waning moon, are shown in some versions of the Trumps by artists who did not understand the deeper symbolism of Kephra and Anubis. That false representation is exactly characteristic of the sort of thing that always is to be expected to occur in connection with the work of the Magician in this sign. * [Misquoted from Book 4 Part II, cap. 6 (p. 62 in first edition), which had ìIt is from the rubbish-heap of Choronzon that one selects the material for a god!î"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 101COLUMN XXXIX: THE PLANTS 0. The Lotus and Rose are attributed to 0 because they have traditionally been taken as glyphs of the circle. 1. The Amond in flower is connected with Aaron's Rod that budded. The Almond is the proper wood for the wand of the White magician, but the attribution should really be to the middle pillar as a whole. The branches of the Banyan tree take fresh roots where they touch the ground and start new main stems: this is connected with the special idea of Kether implied in the Philosophy given in the Commentary on the Book of the Law. 2. The Amaranth is the flower of immortality. It is here placed in order to symbolize that quality of the Yod of Tetragrammaton, the principle of Chiah. The Mistletoe is given for a similar reason. The Bo or Pipal tree was the shelter of Buddha at the moment of his enlightenment. Furthermore, its leaves suggest the phallus. 3. The Cypress pertains to Saturn. The Opium Poppy is connected with sleep, night and understandings. The Lotus is the general feminine symbol. The Lily suggests the purity of the Great Mother. The Ivy has dark leaves and its clinging nature reminds us of feminine or curving growth. 4. The Olive is attributed to Jupiter because of its softness and richness. Its colour furthermore suggests that of the watery part of Mal-kuth in the Queen Scale (Column XVI). The Shamrock of four leaves, a good-luck plant, suggests Jupiter. The Opium Poppy is Jupiterian as giving relief from pain, quiet, and olympian detatchment. 5. The Oak and Hickory are attributed here because of the hardness of their wood. Nux Vomica, on account of its tonic properties and the action of strychnine in causing the contraction of muscles with convulsive violence. The Nettle, on account of its burning sting. 6. The Oak is also, and more properly, attributed to Tiphereth because it was the sacred tree of the Druids, the representative in the vegetable kingdom of the Sun. Its strength is also taken as harmonious with that quality in man. Furthermore, the Acorn is peculiarly phallic,"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 102and this is properly to be attributed to Tiphereth because in this case the phallic symbol contains in itself the essence of the being to be repro-duced. The Acacia is placed here as a symbol of resurrection as in the rituals of Free Masonry. The Bay and Laurel are sacred to Apollo, the Vine to Dionysus. Gorse, the sacred flower of the Α∴Α∴ was chosen as their heraldic emblem to be a symbol of the Great Work. Its appearance is that of the Sun in full blaze, and suggests the burning bush of Moses. Its branches are exceedingly firm, as should be the Will of the Adept, and they are covered with sharp spikes, which symbolize, on the one hand, the phallic energy of the Will and, on the other, the pains which are glady endured by one who puts forth his hand to pluck this bloom of sunlight splendour. Note that the Great Work is here concentrated in Tiphereth, the attainment of the Grade corresponding to which is in fact the critical stage on the Path of the Wise. The Ash is one of the most important of the solar trees; the wood is firm and elastic. The World-Ash represents the microcosm in legend. Yggdrasil is itself an Ash. Aswata, the World-Fig, should also be attributed here as the Tree itself in the microcosm. 7. The Rose has always been a special flower of Venus. The Laurel is included because a wreath of these leaves is a symbol of victory. 8. Moly is mentioned in Homer as having been given by Hermes to Ulysses to counteract the spells of Circe. It has a black root and white blossom, which again suggests the dual currents of energy. Anhalonium Lewinii* has for one of its principal characteristics the power to produce very varied and brilliant colour visions. 9. The Banyan is given here for the same reason as that in line 1. It is, so to speak, the foundation of a system of trees as Yesod is the foundation of the branches of the Tree of Life. The Mandrake is the typically phallic plant. It is peculiarly adapted to use in sexual magic, and it does have a direct connection with the automatic consciousness which has its seat in Yesod. Damiana is reputed a powerful aphrodisiac, and so are Ginseng and Yohimba. * [Now Lophophora williamsi; the peyote cactus.]"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 10310. The Willow is the traditional tree of the neglected maiden, Malkuth unredeemed. The Lily suggests that maidenís purity, and the Ivy her clinging and flexible nature. All Cereals pertain to Malkuth, Wheat being the foundation of the Pentacle which represents Nephesch. The Pomegranate is sacred to Proserpine; in appearance also it is strongly suggestive of the feminine symbol. THE ELEMENTS 11. Aspen resembles Air, by its trembling. 23. The Lotus is the traditional planet of Water. Its roots are in water and its purity further suggests the action of water in lustration. 31. The Red Poppy is given in this place only on account of its colour, and the same is true of Hibiscus. All scarlet flowers might be equally well placed here. But the attribution is not very satisfactory, as the nature of flowers in themselves is not usually fiery except as their perfume is a stimulant. 32 bis. The Oak is given on account of its stability, and the Ivy because of the analogy of Earth with Malkuth. All Cereals pertain here, Wheat, the typical cereal, being the foundation of the Pentacle. 31 bis. For Almond see line 1. It should be generally remarked with regard to the elemental attributions in this column that the seed should be taken as representing Spirit with a slight admixture of Fire, the stem as Fire, the blossom as Water, the leaf as Air, and the fruit as Earth. Note that the fruit usually contains the seed of the new genera-tion exactly as the Empresses are called the Thrones of Spirit. THE PLANETS 12. The attributions given here are traditional. The Palm is Mercurial, as being hermaphrodite. The Lime or Linden tree is Mercur-ial because of its pale yellow fruit with a peculiarly clean-tasting pulp. 13. These attributions are again traditional. The Hazel is suitable for the wand of the Black magician whose typical deity is the Moon just as that of the White magician is the Sun. The Pomegranate is also attri-buted here as a symbol with reference to menstruation. The Alder has a soft spongy wood which gives very little heat when burned. It haunts"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 104watery spots. 14. These are traditional also. The Fig is Venusian on account of its sexual symbolism. The Peach belongs to Venus on account of its soft beauty and sweetness, the external splendour of its bloom being easily brushed off, its tendency to rot and the prussic acid in its kernel. The Apple is traditionally appropriate to Venus on account of the legend of the Fall. There are however various traditions concerning the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. 21. The Hyssop is Jupiterian on account of its religious use in lustration. It might perhaps be more properly attributed to Chesed. The Oak is traditionally sacred to Jupiter, perhaps because it is the king of the trees as Jupiter is king of the gods. The Poplar is given on account of its soft and easily swollen wood and because of its great height. The Fig is Jupiterian because of its soft, swollen and, so to speak, sensual pulp; and also perhaps because of its rich purple colour, suggesting episcopal vestments. Arnica is attributed to Jupiter for its use in relieving pain. Cedar has a traditional value in religious workóits perfume is devotional according to the testimony of intuition, and it is supposed to preserve things in its neighbourhood from the attacks of moths, etc. 27. Absinthe and Rueóthese attributions are traditional. 30. The first three attributions are obvious. The Nut is solar, as being a microcosm of Life, the fruit being also the seed. Galangan is specially sacred to the Sun; it is of the ginger family. 32. The Ash is given in connection with the phrase ìashen pale.î (The real nature of the tree is more properly solar.) In the other cases, in connection with the ideas of death, melancholy, poison, etc. The Elm is Saturnian on account of its murderous habit of dropping boughs without warning. The wood is also traditionally the best available the best available for coffins. THE ZODIAC 15. The Olive is sacred to Minerva, but Geranium has a scarlet variety which is precisely the colour of Aries in the King Scale. The"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 105Tiger Lily is a traditional attribution. 16. Again traditional. We might possibly add giant trees of all species to this sign. 17. Hybrids are here for the same reason as in the previous column. Orchids might perhaps better be attributed to Yesod or Capricorn for obvious reasons; they are found here on account of their duplex characteristics. 18. The Lotus is the typical flower of Water and the Moon. 19.* 20. The Snowdrop and the Lily suggest the modest purity of the sign. Narcissus refers to the solitary tradition. Mistletoe is indicated by the macroscopic appearance of semen. 22. This attribution is traditional. 24. The Cactus has watery pulp poisonous spikes. The Nettle is treacherously Martial. All treacherous and poisonous planets may be attributed to Scorpio. 25. The Rush is used for making arrows. 26. Yohimbaósee line 9. Thistle is hard, stubborn and spikely. Orchis root is connected with the Cult of Pan. Indian Hemp is tough and fibrous, thus used for making ropes; but see the Column XLIII dealing with vegetable drugs for other properties of this plant. 28. Cocoanut; this attribution is doubtful. There may be some connection with Juno as giving milk or with the symbol of the Waterbearer, because the tree gives us fruit from the air. 29. Opium is given because of its power to produce a peaceful dreamy condition which is liable to end in a stagnation of the mental faculties. Unicellular Organisms are possibly attributed here because they are so frequently found in pool. The Mangrove is not merely a tree of the swamp, but actually produces swamps. * [No explanation given, not that one was needed. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 106COLUMN XL: PRECIOUS STONES 0. These attributions are somewhat bold. The Star Sapphire refers to Nuit and the Black Diamond to the idea of NOXóZero. It is invisible yet contains light and structure in itself. 1. The Diamond is white brilliance; it is pure carbon, the foundation of all living structure. The atomic weight is 12, the number of Hua, the title of Kether (but this is a reference to the Zodiac which makes the connection with Zero, on the one hand, and 2, on the other). 2. The Star Ruby represents the male energy of the Creator Star. Turquoise suggests Mazloth, so also does the Star Sapphire, but this would be the sphere of Chokmah not its positive attribution. 3. The Star Sapphire suggests the expanse of night with the Star appearing in the midst thereof. Note that this light is not in the stone itself but is due to the internal structure. The doctrine is that the stars are formed in the body nof night by virtue of the form of the night by the impact fo the energy of a higher plane. The Pearl is referred to Binal on account of its being the typical stone of the sea. It is formed by concentric spheres of hard brilliant substance, the centre being a particle of dust. Thus, that dust which is all that remains of the Exempt Adept after he has crossed the Abyss, is gradually surrounded by sphere after sphere of shining splendour, so that he vbecomes a fitting ornament for the bosom of the Great Mother. 4. Lapiz Lazuli is of the blue violet of the highest form of Jupiter. The specks in it may perhaps be taken to represent those particles of dust referred to above. The Amethyst is the violet of Jupiter. It is the traditional stone of episcopal rank. Its legendary virtue of protecting its bearer from intoxication indicates its value in lustration. It is the purity of the Exempt Adept which destroys for him the illusion or drunkenness of existence, and therefore enables him to take the great leap into the Abyss.

The Emerald is of the green of Venus in the King Scale. 8. The Opal has the varied colours attributed to Mercury. 9. Quartz refers to the foundation. Note that gold is found in Quartz, suggesting the concealed glory of the sexual process. 10. Rock Crystal reminds us of the aphorism: Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth in Kether, but after another manner. THE ELEMENTS 11. Topaz is the pure transparent yellow of Air. 23. The Beryl is the pure transparent blue of Water. 31. The Fire Opal suggests the appearance of fire rising from the blackness of the matter which it consumes. 32 bis.

Agate has the Mercurial yellow, but its hardness indicates a strange Saturnian element in it. It might indeed be attributed to Geburah for its orange tinge and its hardness, but it is not sufficiently pure to rank as a precious stone, and must therefore not be placed among the Sephiroth. 13. The Moonstone is a direct image of the Moon. Pearl and Crystal are given for the suggestion of purity (see lines 3 and 10). 14. Emerald is the colour of Venus in the King Scale (Column XV). Turquiose is the blue of Venus in the Queen Scale (Column XVI), but its tendency is to fade into green.

It is also one of the hardest of precious stones. 16. Topaz refers to the letter Vau, Tipherethósee line 6. 17. These stones are given here on account of their polarization of light. 18. Amber is of the colour of Cancer in the King Scale: were it a precious stone, it might be attributed to Chokmah or Binah on account of its electrical properties. 19. The Catís Eye suggests Leo directly. 20. The Peridot is the colour of Virgo in the King Scale. 22. Emerald is of the colour of Libra in the King Scale. 24. Snakestone suggests Scorpio directly.

Jacinth is Hyacinth, the beautiful boy accidentally killed by Apollo with a quoit, the attribution is therefore somewhat far-fetchedófrom the blood of the boy to the traditional weapons of his lover. 26. For Black Diamond see line 0 and 32-bis. The reference is to the letter Aíain, the eye. The Black Diamond reminds us of the pupil of the eye, and this eye is the eye of the Most Holy Ancient One; Kether. Capricorn is the zenith of the Zodiac as Kether is of the Sephiroth. 28. Artificial Glass pertains to Aquarius, as being the work of man, the Kerub of Air. Chalcedony suggests the clouds by its appearance. 29.

"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 109COLUMN XLI: MAGICAL WEAPONS The full meaning of these weapons will be found in Book 4, Part II, and in Magick in Theory and Practice. Here we can only give brief reasons for their attribution. 0. No magical weapon can be attributed here, for they are all positive. The reduction of the positive to Zero is the goal of all magical work. 1. The Crown is the meaning of Kether. It refers to the Supreme Divinity which the magician assumes in his working. The Swastika symbolize whirling energy, the initiation of all magical force—the Rashith ha-Gilgalim. There is a great deal of varied symbolism in this instrument, notably sexual; it demands a great deal of study to appreciate fully the virtue of this weapon. The Lamp is not a weapon; it is a light shining from above which illuminates the whole work. 2. The Lingam is the symbol of the Chiah, the creative energy. The Inner Robe symbolizes the true self of the magician, his “unconscious” as the psychoanalysts call it. Their description, however, of its characteristic is totally incorrect. The Word is the intellegible expression of the Will of the creative energy of the Magus. 3. The Yoni represents Neschamah. The Outer Robe refers to the darkness of Binah. The Α∴Α∴ star refers to the aspiration. The Cup receives the influence from the Highest. It must be distinguished emphatically from the wand or hollow tube of Chokmah which transmits the influence in its positive form in an intelligible manner but without understanding its nature. 4. The Wand is the reflection of the Lingam as the paternal power of Chesed in the solidification of the male creative energy of Chokmah. The Sceptre is the weapon of authority referrring to Jupiter (Gedulah—magnificence). The Crook is the weapon of Chesed—Mercy as opposed to the scourge of Geburah. 5. The Scourge is the weapon of severity as opposed to the Crook. This is the explanation of those two weapons being crossed in the hands of the risen Osiris. The Sword is the weapon of Mars, so also is the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 110Spear. These weapons emphasize the fiery energy in the creative Lingam. The Chain represents the severity of the restrictions which must be placed on wandering thoughts: it might more properly be attributed to Daath. It does not really exist on the magician himself. Its function is to bind that which is above all Not-He. It is thus the only weapon which does not possess a definite unity of form and which has multiple units in its composition. 6. The Lamen represents the symbolic form of the Human Will and Consciousness of the magician. The Rosy Cross is technically pertinent to Tiphereth. 7. The Lamp carried in the hand pertains to Netzach because Love must be enkindled by the magician. It throws light as required on particular objects. This Lamp must in no wise be confused with that of Kether. The Girdle is the traditional weapon of Venus. It represents the ornament of beauty. When it is untied it can be used to bind and blind-fold the candidate. It thus represents the power of fascination by love. 8. The Names and Versicles are Mercurial. They expand the Logos, explain it in three-dimensional (that is, material) terms, just as the number 8 is a three-dimensional expansion of the number 2. The Apron conceals the Splendour (Hod) of the magician. It also explains that splendour by virtue of its symbolic design. 9. The Perfumes pertain to Yesod as forming a link between earth and heaven. This link is material by virtue of the substance of the incense, and spiritual by virtue of thie action through the olfactory sense upon the consciousness. The Sandals enable the magician to ìtravel on the firmament of Nu.î The Sandal-strap is the Ankh which represents the mode of going, going being the essential faculty of every god. This strap, whose form is that of the Rosy Cross, forms a link between the material apparatus of his going and his feet; that is to say, the formula of the Rosy Cross enables a man to goóor, in other words, endows him with Godhead. The Altar is the foundation of the operation. Its characteristic is stability; also it resembles Yesod as supporting the Ruach; that is to say, the means of the Formative World (Ruach = Yetzirah) through which it is proposed to work. The Altar and the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 111sacrifice might also as well have been attributed to Tiphereth. This would, in fact, be actually better in the case of certain types of operation, such as invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel, for in this case the human heart is the foundation of the work. 10. The Circle and Triangle are the spheres of operation of the magician and his work which is in Malkuth, the kingdom, the Realm of Assiah. The Triangle being outside the Circle, is the place of the Spirit, but it belongs not to him for his realm is formlessness. The Triangle is the figure into which Choronzon must be evoked in order to confer form upon him. THE ELEMENTS 11. The Dagger, the characteristic elemental weapon of Air. The Fanóthis symbolzes the power to direct the forces of Air. 23. The Cross of Suffering refers to the now superseded formula of Osiris. See the original emblem of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a triangle surmounted by a Cross. The Cup is the traditional elemental weapon of Water. The Wine fills the Cupóit is the divine ecstasy entering the receptive part of the nature of the magician. The Water of Lustration in the Cup of the Stolistes balances the Fire in the thurible of the Dadouchos. 31. The Wand is the elemental weapon of Fire. It is not to be confused with the Wand of Chokmah or Chesed any more than the Cup of Water is to be mistaken for that of Binah. The Elemental weapons are but vice-regents of the true weapons of the Sephiroth. The thurible or lamp is borne by the Dadouchos to consecrate the candidate with fire. The Pyramid of Fire is an altogether minor weapon and is only used in certain ceremonies of uncommon type.* 32 bis. The Pantacle is the elemental weapon of Earth. The platter of bread and salt, or sometimes salt alone, is its equivalent, but is used actively to administer to the candidate sometimes to seal his obligation, sometimes to nourish him spiritually. Bread and Salt are the two principal substances traditionally sacred to Earth. * [The reference is possibly to one of the Golden Dawn admission badges. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 11231 bis. The Winged Egg is symbolical of the spiritualized phallic energy. The Egg is Akasa, the source of all creation. There are many equivalent symbols. THE PLANETS 12. The Wand is that of the Will or Word, the Logos. The Caduceus is the legendary wand of Mercury, and to be carefully distinguished from the hollow tube of Chokmah. It represents the Middle Pillar crowned by the Winged Globe of Kether. It is thus the plumed phallus as distinguished from the Phoenix-crowned phallus of animal-life creation through the initiaiton of Fire (see line 19), and the flowering phallus of the Lotus-crowned Wand of Isis, the wand of vegetable-life creation through the initiation of Water (see line 20). The Serpents of the Caduceus, the positive and negative forms of energy, resume the powers of these two wands. 13. The Bow and Arrow are traditionally the weapons of Artemis and Apollo (see line 30). 14. See line 7. 21. See line 4. The Sceptre is not a true weapon. It is the symbol of authority, an ornamental reminder of the wand which is kept in the background. The Sceptre must not be used to strike, it would break: as soon as its virtue is challenged, it must be instantly discarded for the thunderbolt. 27. This Sword is not to be confused with the Dagger of Air. It represents the active and militant energy of the magician. Its true form is the flaming sword, the lightning flash, which strikes down from Kether through the Sephiroth as a zig-zag flash. It destroyed by dividing the unity of that against which its energies are directly. It is ultimately an error to identify the sword with the wand as a phallic symbol though this is often done. In the Lesser Mysteries of ìJohnî the sword and disk repressent the Wand and cup of the Greater Mysteries of ìJesus.î In the former, John the Baptist's head is removed by sword (air) and presented on a charger, the platter or disk of earth. In the latter, the heart of Jesus is pierced by the Spear, the Wand of Fire, and"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 113the blood collected in the Cup or Graal (water). But the Sword and Disk are not sufficiently sacred to be truly phallic. This is one of the subtle distinctions which afford the key to the finest spiritual comprehension. 30. The Lamen is solar, as representing the light of the human consciousnessóin the Heart (Tiphereth)óof the magician to the spirit evoked. It is his statement to the spirit of his intention towards it, of the formula which he intends to employ; it must in no wise be confused with the Pantacle, which is passive as the Lamen is active. The one represeents the condition of things in general, the other his method of dealing with that condition. Bow and Arrowósee line 13. 32. The Sickle is the traditional weapon of Saturn. It implies the power of time to reap the harvest of manís life and work. It may be used in actual ceremony to threaten the spirit that Choronzon will cut short his independent existence, that Choronzon will reap his Karma, and add it to the treasure of Choronzonís storehouse. THE ZODIAC 15. The Horns are those of the Ram; they signify the power of thought, the energy of Minerva. The Burin is used for engraving the Lamen, Pantacles, etc. Being a Knife, its character is martial, but also it pertains especially to Aries because it is used to indicate the creative ideas of the magician. 16. The Throne refers to Vau: the Heart must support and admit the lordship of the higher consciousness of the magician. The Altar may also be attributed to Taurus on account of its solidity and its function of bearing the higher elements of the magician. There is a mystery of Europa and PasiphaÎ connected with this attribution. 17. The Tripod would appear at first sight to be Lunar; but this is wrong. The real connection is with ATU VI, the ìOracle of the Mighty Gods.î 18. The Furnace is connected with the eargy of the Sun in Cancer. The Cup is the Holy Graal. 19. The Phoenix Wandósee line 12. 20. The Lamp and Wand appear in ATU IX as the weapons of the Hermit. This Wand is concealed: it is the virile energy reserved. This"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 114Lamp has the same significance and is not to be confused with other lamps. The Bread is the natural product, the fertile earth; it convey sacramentally, ìevery word that cometh out of the mouth of God.î The Lotus Wandósee line 12. 22. The Cross of Equilibrium is impled or expressed in every part of the arrangements of the Temple. The Balances, or Witnesses, as shown in ATU VIII, are in actual practice concealed with the Sword. They represent the complete phallus, the secret weapon, which alone can satisfy; that is, do justice to Nature. 24. The Oath is the formula of transmutation. The Serpent is connected with several of the magical weapons, and implies the secret kingly power of the magician, the essense of the phallic energy as employed in transmutation. 25. The Arrow is sacred to the rainbow symbolism. It represents especially the spritualization of the magical energy, being a missle sped through the air, no longer connected physically with the material form of the magician. 26. Compare line 20. 28. The Censer carries the perfumes as the clouds carry the distillation of the water of earth. The Aspergillus similarly sprinkles the lustral waters as the clouds shed rain. 29. Magical operations are usually performed in an artificial twilight; this represents the glamour of the astral plane which the magician proposes to illume with the divine light. The natural attribution of this idea is evidently ATU XVIII. The Magic Mirror reflects astral forms. It is evidently cognate with the still waters of Pisces, and the entire symbolism is again obviously that of ATU XVIII. COLUMN XLII: PERFUMES These attributions are founded for the most part upon tradition. Some of them are connected with legend, others are derived from clairvoyant observation. The rational basis of attribution is, therefore, less apparent in this column than in those of the Gods, Magical Weapons, etc."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 1150. No attribution can be made here, 0 being the goal of a magical operation by love under will, and any perfume will be an expression of that love under will itself. 1. Ambergris has comparatively little perfume of its own, but it has a virtue of bringing out the best of any others with which it may be mixed. In the same way, Kether cannot be said to have any intrinsic qualities, but its influence brings out the highest faculties of those ideas which it illuminates. 2. The orchitic origin of Musk indicates Chokmah. This is the male aspect of the Work. 3. Civet, ìthe uncleanly flux of a cat,î corresponds to Musk as Binah to Chokmah, its origin being feminine. Myrrh is traditionally the odour of sorrow and bitterness; it is the dark and passive side of Binah. ì Brothers, I have brought him myrrh. Sorrow black and sinister Shall his name bring to the race.î* ìMy incense is of resinous woods and gums; and there is no blood therein: because of my hair the trees of Eternity.îÜ 4. See Column XXXIX. 5. Tobacco. This attribution is due to Frater D.D.S. (who was a chemist). It seems to me not altogether satisfacory. The idea is presumably that it is the favourite perfume for men engaged in hard work. 6. The correctness of this should be intuitively perceived at once by every magician. Olibanum possesses a comprehensive catholic quality such as no other incense can boast. 7. The sensuous seductiveness of Benzoin is unmistakable. Contrast with line 24. Rose naturally suggests the more physical aspects of the feminine symbol. Civet, however, is much more strongly sexual than Rose, but this implies a more intense element of spirituality. The student must eliminate completely from his mind any idea that sex is * [Crowley, The Worldís Tragedy, Act III. The New Falcon printing has ìMother, I have brought Öî I do not know which reading is correct. ó T.S.] Ü [AL I. 59.]"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 116naturally gross. On the contrary, even the lowest manifestations of it in its pure form are less material than such ideas as are represented by Rose. Demonic, not material, developments follow the degradation of the instinct. Red Sandal is Venusian, intuitively by its smell, and sensibly by its colour. The attribution is further guaranteed by the usefulness of its oil as a specific of gonorrhoea. 8. Storax is chiefly Mercurial on account of its nondescript nature. It is really less valuable as a perfume itself than as a menstruum for other perfumes, in the same was as Mercury is the basis of amalgams. But Storax is really to dark and heavy to bew a really adequate perfume for Hod. 9. Jasmin is traditionally sacred, especially in Persia, to the spiritual use of the generative process. Ginsengósee Column XXXIX. Roots are sacred to Yesod as the reproductive function is the root of the life of man. It is important not to suppose that Malkuth, Nephesch, is the root of reality. Malkuth is a pendant to the Tree, a sensory illusion which enables it to perceive itself. 10. Dittany of Crete was said by Blavatsky to be the most powerful of all magical perfumes. This is true in a limited sense. Its smoke is the best basis for material magical manifestations of all those menstrua which are not animal. It is quite as catholic as Olibanum in character but has no positive element in its composition. Further, its velvet softness and its silvery bloom remind one of Betulah. There are many allusions in classical traditions to Dittany, which all point to the same attribution. THE ELEMENTS 11. Galbanum represents the element of Air in that exceedingly powerful incense of Tetragrammaton whose invention is ascribed to Moses. 23. Onycha represents Water in the incense of Moses. It is now very difficult to obtain, though at one time I possessed a supply. Its origin is somehow connected with certain shellfish. Myrrhósee line 3. 31. Olibanum is the fiery elemental incense of Moses."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 11732 bis. Storax is the earth elemental incense of Moses. 31 bis. No attribution can be made here. See line 1. THE PLANETS At one time or another mediÊval writers on magic have attributed every possible incense to every possible planet. Tradition, therefore, gives little to us in this investigation, while the sense of smell varies enormously. One may almost say it is impossible for any two people to agree about any given perfume, and when they occur in combination, the diversity of opinion is even more striking. The spiritual bearing of the perception is naturally yet more illusive and indeterminate. The attributions given in this column may be considered perfectly reliable, being based as far as possible upon considerations of essential virtue, independent of sensation. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the student to undertake experimental investigations in every case. A proper comprehension of the virtues of perfumes is of the utmost importance to the work of the Adeptus Major, for they constitute the most vital link between the material and astral planes, and it is precisely this link which the Adeptus Major most intimately needs. The method of burning the perfumes is of much greater importance than is generally understood. Except for material workings, the gross body of the incense should not be carbonized. The heat applied should be only that sufficient to drive off the essential aromatic substance. In many cases it is best to evaporate the essential oil previously extracted secundum artem. The thurible should be of the (properly consecrated) metal appropriate to the incense; mixed perfumes should be burned on silver or gold, preferably gold. Failure to obtain the utmost possible perfection in any of these points is often sufficient to vitiate the most elaborate ceremony. 12. Mastic is pale yellow, and its perfume is singularly clean and free from any prejudice (to use a somewhat strange term) either for or against any particular moral idea. Its action on other perfumes is usually to intensify them and quicken their rate of vibration. White"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 118Sandal is free from the sensuousness of its Red twin. Note that the sympathy of Mercury and Venus is very strong, but it resembles that of the epicene adolescent, the Amazon maiden on the languishing boy, as opposed to the definitely sexualized youth in the romantic period of rose-coloured spectacles. Nutmeg is probably attributed to Mercury on account of its yellowish tinge. White Mace, the husk which covers it, is Mercurial. Red Mace is probably solar. Storaxósee line 8. Fugitive odours are Mercurial for the obvious reasons. 13. The attribution of Menstrual Fluid to Luna depends not only on the periodicity, but on the fact that Luna is herself the symbolical vehicle of the solar light. Camphoróthe white waxen appearance suggests Luna, so also the perfume is peculiarly cleanly. It is supposed by some to be useful as a disinfectant. It is in fact useful against moths. This is sympathetic with the idea of lustration. The Mexican Aloes furnishes an alcoholic drink, Pulque, whose cloudy whiteness suggests Luna. Lignum Aloes is a wood in powder, whose physical appearance suggests purity of aspiration to the sensitive observer. The connection is therefore directly with the Path of Gimelósee line 25. Virginal odours obviously suggest the Virgin Moon. Sweet odours are also lunar, because the moon represents the physical senses and refers to the common people. Similarly sugar and sweet things generally are much liked by children (who are classed under Luna) and by that vast herd of mankind, and espcially those woman whose sense of taste is not sufficiently refined to appreciate real delicateness. Sweetness masks all finer qualities unless they be peculiarly violent: hence the use of sugar, chloroform water and similar compounds to conceal the unpleasant taste of certain medicines. 14. Sandalwoodósee line 7. Myrtle, the traditional plant of Venus. Softness and voluptuousness are two of the principle qualities of Venus. 21. Saffron has brilliant purple filaments. An orange dye is prepared from it which indicates the solar nature. But this is sympa-thetic to Jupiter, and in any case refers to a watery element in its nature, whereas this column deals with the airy constituents of the substance described. The perfume of Saffron is intuitively perceived as generous,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 119rich, and suggesting the sensuous enjoyment of devotion. 27. Pepper is evidently Martial owing to its fiery qualitiy and its specific action on the mucous membrane of the nostrils. Dragon's Blood gives off a dark red smoke, is angry looking, unpleasant to smell, and intuitively perceived as smouldering irritability. Heat and pungency are two principle qualities of Mars. 30. Olibanumósee line 6, Cinnamonóthe appearance is decidedly solar; any martial element therein is not confirmed by the perfume, which resembles that of a hot summer day, in the opinion of many sensitives. It is also solar on account of its cordial and carminative properties. ìGloriousî is the prime epithet of the external character of Sol. By ìglorious odoursî are meant those which arouse in the percipient sensations of enjoyment of well-being, with possibly the influx of a certain quality of pride. 32. There is little difficultly in recognizing Saturnian perfumes; the difficulty in practice is to find one which is at all tolerable to the sense of smell. In magical work of the kind which borders upon the material plane, large quantities of incense are necessary and incantation becomes difficult when the magician is being rapidly asphyxiated. The Adeptus Major can indeed cut himself off from such inconveniences but it is otherwise for the beginner. This is one more of the many reasons which have caused teachers to warn their pupils against attempting to work on the plane of Saturn until they are far advanced. Yet this caution exposes the dsiciple to an even worse danger than that of being choked, which is to formulate an incomplete and unbalanced universe. Assafoetidaópure samples are not intolerably unpleasant. Scammony is repulsive, principally because of its suggestion of domestic cookery. Indigo furnishes a smoke of the characteristic dark blue of Saturn; the smoke is composed of very solid particles; and this perfume is accordingly both wholly in keeping with the nature of the Planet and pre-eminently suitable for material workings. Sulphur. This is the most difficult incense with which to work. It is liable to provoke fits of coughing, and may even be dangerous, but it is certainly the most usesful in conjuration of the infernal powers. (By ìEvilî is meant"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 120principally that quality which threates the magician with failure and, philosophically speaking, this qualitiy is pre-eminently the category of Time, which is Saturn.) THE ZODIAC 15. See line 27. 16. It may be doubted whether the indifference of Storax, referred to in line 8, is really Mercurial: it might almost equally well be the neutrality of dullness, the characteristic of the passive laborious earth. The perfume of Storax suggests the patience of cattle, and even physical the peculiar sweetish scent of a cowshed. 17. Wormwood probably pertains to Gemini on account of the intellectual stimulation which it affords in such a magical preparation as Absinthe. 18. See line 23. 19. Olibanum, combining the ideas of fire and Sol, is pre-eminently suited to Leo, the Kerub of Fire, the house of the Sun. 20. See Column XXXIX. 22. See line 11. Galbanum has a peculiar scent which intuitively suggests danger or even evil. There is a hint of hidden treachery, which is nevertheless seductive. This refers to the exaltation of Saturn in Libra, the house of Venus, which refers to the impregnation of the idea of Love by that of Death. It recalls the rape of Persephone by Hades; or, more appropriately still, that tragic element in love which has formed a theme of all great poets, from Aeschylus and Homer to Shakespeare and Goethe. 24. Siamese Benzoin is to be distinguished from that found in other countries. It has a peculiar odour strongly suggestive of the treachery of the snake. It is the hidden poison not unlike that of Galbanum. The voluptuousness of the perfume is of that type of debauchery whose fascination is directly connected with the knowledge of its fatal issue. Opoponax refers even more directly to Scorpio than does Siamese Benzoin. There is in it even less of the sensuousness of pleasure; there is an overpowering richness of the deliciously abominable."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"EXPLANATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS 12125. See line 13. The perfume of Lignum Aloes intuitively suggests horsemanship in an airy racecourse, as distinguished from chariot-eering, as if oneís racecourse were a rainbow. One experiences the intense amazon purity of Atalanta. Oneís aspiration becomes winged. It is therefore to Sagittarius, not as the house of Jupiter, but as the path leading from Yesod to Tiphereth, that this perfume applies. 26. Musk and Civet are referred here on account of their sexual origin, and of their effect upon the aura of the magician. The regular Saturnian perfumes would only be employed in amefic work and in other of the baser aspects of Capricorn. 28. See lines 11 and 22. This attribution is not very satisfactory. There is more in Galbanum than the Saturnian and airy elements. Galbanum is too exciting to be a truly Aquarian perfume; it is too demonic, it lacks the element of humanity. In the humanitarianism of Aquarius there is no magician to understand that ìLove is the law, love undew will.î It is the smug aloofness of the philanthropist. Certain schools of late years have written very enthusiastically of Aquarius, but their attitude may seem to adherents of the true Rosicrucian doctrine as somewhat hypocritical and pharisaical. This is to be explained by the fact that in Aquarius the Sun is in his detriment. People who wish to reform the world (on a pattern of theoretical excellence totally unconnected with human nature) are at the very antipodes of solar life and light. They fear vitality. 29. See line 13. This Luna of ATU XVIII is to be contrasted strongly with that of ATU II. The path of Gimel leads from Tiphereth to Kether: it is the unswerving virginal aspiration of the human heart to its divine Lord. The postulant at the gate of the Holy of Holies puts off his pride of manhood and offers himself passively as a bride of his sublime Master. His starting point is the perfection of his human self, and his goal the unity of Absolute Truth, above all quantity or quality. On the contrary, the path of Qoph leads from Malkuth to Netzach. It is the fluctuating craving of the animal soul for the sensuous gratifications of illusory victory. By the treacherous light of the waning Moon, the wanderer stumbles through the swamps upon the edge of the black pool"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 122of the Abyss, along the winding path beset by the hell-hounds, up barren slopes to where two ìsquat turrets, blind as the foolís heart,î guard a pass leading he knows not where.

The path leads away from the middle pillar, to the anarchy of the unbalanced astral wilderness. It is the essence of error. He should rather trust himself to the Bark of the Midnight Sun, the Winged Beetle, to bear him to the Dawn. He should rather follow the path of Tau, passing through the balanced Elements of the astral palne, despite their darkness and their terror. The Menstrual Fluid is, however, the medium for the one as for the other. But on the path of Qoph there is no creative energfy to fertilize the ova, no light to purify and vitalize their possibilities. The path of Qoph is that of witchcraft. The Great Work is not accomplished. The Postulant is not the ecstatic bride who knows that she will be endowed from on high with the great grace of motherhood, but the hag who clutches at the false gratifications of hysteria. Instead of the human consciousness being thrilled directly by the pure light of its One Lord, the animal sensorium is agitated by the confused jabberings of those demons who personate great souls, human or divine. It is the difference between the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and the hideous intimacy with the dÈbris of decaying minds, momenetarily galvanized into manifestation by imbecile of malignant entities.

One of the greatest difficulties experienced by the studentóa difficulty which increases rather than diminishes with his advance in knowledge\"is this: he finds it impossible to gain any clear idea of the meanings of the terms which he employs. Every philosopher has his own meaning, even for such universally used terms as soul; and in most cases he does not so much as suspect that other writers use the term under a different connotation. Even technical writers and those who take the trouble to define their terms before using them are too often at variance with each other. The diversity is very great in the case of this word soul. It is sometimes used to mean Atman, an impersonal principle almost synonymous with the Absoluteóitself a word which has been defined with scores of different senses. Others use it to mean the personal individual soul as distinguished from the over-soul or God. Others take it as equivalent to Neschamah, the Understanding, the intelligible essence of man, his aspiration; yet others mean the Nephesch, the animal soul, the consciousness corresponding to the senses. It has even been identified with the Ruach which is really the mechanism of the mind. Apart from these major distinctions there are literally hundreds of minor shades of meanings. We find therefore a writer predicating the soul A, B, and C, while his fellow student protests vehemently that it is none of these thingsódespinte which the two men may be in substantial agreement. Let us suppose for a moment that by some miracle we obtain a clear idea of the meaning of the word. The trouble has merely begun, for"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"ON THE MAGICAL ALPHABET 125there immediately arises the question of the relations of one term to the others. There have been few attempts at constructing a coherent system; and those that are coherent are not comprehended. In view of this Euroclydon of misunderstanding it is clearly necessary to establish a fundamental language. I saw this fact in my twenties. My extended travels throughout the world had brought me into contact with religious and philosophical thinkers of every shade of opinion: and the more I knew the greater became the confusion. I understood, with bitter approval, the outburst of the aged Fichte: ìIf I had my life to live again, the first thing I would do would be to invent an entirely new syatem of symbols whereby to convey my ideas.î As a matter of fact, certain people, notably Raymond Lully, have attempted this great work. I discussed this question with Bhikkhu Ananda Metteya (Allan Bennett) in 1904. He professed himself completely satisfied with the Buddhist terminology. I could not concur with his opinion. Firstly, the actual words are barbarously long, impossibly so for the average European. Secondly, an understanding of the system demands complete acquiescence in the Buddhist doctrines. Thirdly, the meaning of the terms is not, as my venerable colleague maintained, as clear and comprehensive as could be wished. There is much pedantry, much confusion, and much disputed matter. Fourthly, the terminology is exclusively psychological. It takes no account of extra-Buddhistic ideas; and it bears little relation to the general order of the universe. It might be supplemented by Hindu terminology. But to do that would immediately introduce elements of controversy. We should at once be lost in endless discussions as to whether Nibbana was Nirvana or not: and so on for ever. The system of the Qabalah is superficially open to the last objection. But its real basis is perfectly sound. We can easily discard the dogmatic interpretation of the Rabbins. We can refer everything in the Universe to the system of pure number whose symbols will be intelligible to all rational minds in an indentical sense. An the relations between these symbols are fixed by nature. There is no particular"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 126pointófor most ordinary purposesóof discussing whether 49 is or is not the square of 7. Such was the nature of the considerations that led me to adopt the Tree of Life as the basis of the magical alphabet. The 10 numbers and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, with their traditional and rational correspondences (taking into consideration their numerical and geometrical interrelations) afford us a coherent systematic groundwork sufficiently rigid for our foundation and sufficiently elastic for our superstructure. But we must not suppose that we know anything of the Tree a priori. We must not work towards any other type of central Truth than the nature of these symbols in themselves. The object of our work must be, in fact, to discover the nature and powers of each symbol. We must clothe the mathematical nakendess of each prime idea in a many-coloured carment of correspondences with every department of thought. Our first task is thus to consider what we are to mean by the word number. I have deal with this in my commentary to Verse 4, Chapter I, of The Book of the Law ìEvery number is infinite: there is no difference.î* The student should be very thoroughly into the question of transfinite number. Let him consult the Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy of the Hon. Bertrand Russell in a reverent but critical spirit. In particular, in the light of my note on number, the whole conception of Aleph ZeroÜ should give him a fairly clear idea of the essential para-doxes of the magical interpretation of the idea of number, and espe-cially of the equation 0 = 2 which I have devised to explain the universe, and to harmonise the antinomies which it presents us at every turn. Our present state of understanding is far from perfect. It is evidently impossible to obtain a clear notion of each of the primes if only because their number is Aleph Zero. * This commentary is including in the present volume, see ìWhat is a ëNumberí or ëSymbolí?î infra.

For they are endless, 10 representing the return to Unity by the reintroduction of Zero to continue the series in a manner progressively complex, each term representing not only itself in its relation with its neighbours, but the combination of two or more numbers of the first decad. That is, until we reach numbers whose factors are all (except unity) greater than 10; as 143 = (11 × 13). But this necessity to consider such numbers as altogether beyond the first decad is only apparent; each prime being itself an elaboration in some sense or other of one or more of the original 0 to 10 series.* This at least may be regarded as conventionally true for immediate purposes of study. A number such as 3299 × 3307 × 3319 may be regarded as a distant and not very important group of fixed stars. (Thus 13 is a ìmiddle modulusî and 111 the ìgreat modulusî of Unity. That is, the multiples of 13 and 111 explain the coefficients of their scales in terms of a more specialised idea of Unity. E.g. 26 = 2 × 13 represents the Dyad in a more specially connotated sense than 2 does; 888 describes the function of 8 in terms of the full meaning of 111, which is itself an elaborate account of the nature of Unity, includingófor instanceóthe dogmatic mystery of the equation 3 = 1.) By repercussion, again, each larger correlative of any number of 0 to 10 expresses an extended idea of that number which must immediately be included in the fundamental conception thereof. For instance, having discovered that 120 can be divided by 5, we must henceforth think of 5 as the root of those ideas which we find in 120, as well as using our previous ideas of 5 as the key to our investigation of 120. On the surface, it would appear that this mode of working could only lead to baffling contradictions and inextricable confusion; but to the mind naturally lucid and well trained to discrimination this misfortune does not occur. On the contrary, practice (which makes perfect) enables one to grasp intelligently and class coherently a far vaster congeries of facts than could possibly be assimilated by the most laborious feats of memorizing.

The excellence of any mind, considered merely as a storehouse of information, may be gauged by its faculty of re-presenting any required facts to itself by systematic classification into groups and sub-groups. This present attempt at a magical alphabet is, in fact, a projection, both intensive and extensive, of this system to infinity. On the one hand, all possible ideas, are referred by progressive integrations to the pure numbers 0 to 10, and thence to 2, 1, and 0. On the other, the connotations of 0, 1, and 2 are extended, by progressive definitions, to include every conceivable idea on the plane of the Universe. We are now in a position to consider the practical application of these ideas. As regards the numbers 0 to 10 of the Key-Scale, each one is a fundamental idea of a positive entity. Its nature is defined by the correspondences assigned to it in the various columns. Thus we may say that the God Hanuman, the Jackal, the Opal, Storax, Truthfulness and so on are all qualities inherent in the idea of 8.

The basic idea had better be considered the letter of the Hebrew Alphabet; and the correspondence of each with fairly comprehensive definitions such as the Tarot Trumps is very close and necessary. (It will be noticed that certain Alphabets, espcially the Coptic, have more than 22 letters. These additional symbols fill up the Tree of Life when attributed to the Sephiroth.*) The numerical value of the letters does however represent a real and important relation. But these numbers are not quite the same as the original sephirotic numbers. For instance, althought Beth = 2, = Mercury, and Mercury is part of the the idea of Chokmah = 2, the one 2 is not identical with the other. For Mercury, in itself, is not a Sephira. It is not a positive emanation in the necessary sequence in the scale 0 to 10. For Beth is the Path which joins Kether and Binah, 1 and 3. Zayin = 7 is the path joining Binah, 3, and Tiphareth, 6. That is, they are not numbers in themselves, but expressions of relations between numbers according to a predetermined geometrical pattern. Another class of number is of immense importance. It is the series usually expressed in Roman numbers which is printed on the Tarot Trumps. Here, with two exceptions, the number is invariable one less than that of the letters of the alphabet, when they are numbered according to their natural order from 1 to 22.Ü These numbers are very nearly of the same order of idea as those of the numerical value of the letters; but they represent rather the active magical energy of the number than its essential being. To return to the pure Sephiroth, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are primes, the others combinations of these primes. Here we have already the principle of equilibrium between the simple and the complex.

Six is an idea in itself, a ìDing an sich.î* The fact that 6 = 2 × 3 is only one of its properties. Similar remarks apply to the numbers about 10, but here the importance of the primes as compared to that of the compound numbers is much greater. Few compound numbers appear in the present state of our knowledge in themselves as distinguished from the value of their mathematical elements. We may however instance 93, 111, 120, 210, 418, 666. But every prime is the expression of a quite definite idea. For instance 19 is the general feminine glyph, 31 the highest feminine trinity, a ìgreat modulusî of Zero. 41 is the aspect of the feminine as a vampire force. 47 as dynamic and spasmodic, 53 as hedonogenous, 59 as claiming its complement, and so on. Each prime number retains its peculiar significance in its multiples. Thus the number 23, a glyph of life, exhibits the lift of the Dyad in 46, etc. The significance of the primes has been carefully worked out, with fair accuracy in each case, up to 97. Above 100 only a few primes have been thoroughly investigated. This is because, by our present methods, such numbers can only be studied through their multiples. That is to say, if we wish to determine the nature of the number 17 we shall examine the series 34, 51, 68, etc., to see what words and ideas corre-spond to them. We shall establish a ratio 51:34 = 3:2. From our know-ledge of 3 and 2 we can compare the effect produced on them by the modulus 17. For instance, 82 is the number of the Angel of Venus and means a thing beloved; 123 means war, a plague, pleasure, violation; and 164 has the idea of cleaving, also of profane as opposed to sacred. The common element in these ideas is a danagerous fascination; whence we say that 41, the highest common factor, is the Vampire.Ü But the above considerations, which would extend the letters of the magical alphabet to an infinity of symbols, are not properly pertinent to * [German, ìThing in itself.î] Ü A dictionary giving the meanings by traditional Qabalah of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 with a few higher numbers is published in The Equinox I (8) under the title ìSepher Sephiroth sub figura D.î"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"ON THE MAGICAL ALPHABET 131this essay.

But the traditional attributions are so numerous and well defined that no remedy seems feasible. (In practice no serious trouble of any kind is caused by the theoretical confusion.) One further difficulty has arisen owing to the discovery of the planets Neptune and Uranus.

The first statement ìEvery number is infiniteî is, on the face of it, a contradiction in terms. But that is only because of the accepted idea of a number as not being a thing in itself but merely a term in series homogeneous in character. All orthodox mathematical argument is based on definitions involving this conception. For example, it is fundamental to admit the identity of 2 plus 1 with 1 plus 2. The Book of the Law presents an altogether different conception of the nature of number. Mathematical ideas involve what is called a continuum, which is, superficially at least, of a different character to the physical continuum. For instance, in the physical continuum, the eye can distinguish between the lengths of one-inch stick and a two-inch stick, but not between these which measure respectively one thousand miles and one thousand miles and on inch, though the difference in each case is equally an inch. The inch difference is either perceptible or not perceptible, according to the conditions. Similarly, the eye can distinguish either the one-inch or the two-inch stick from one of an inch and a half. But we cannot continue this process indefinitelyówe can always reach a point where the extremes are distinguishable from each other but their mean from neither of the extremes. Thus, in the physical continuum, if we have three terms, A, B, and C, A appears equal to B, and B to C, yet C appears greater than A. Our reason tells us that this conclusion is an absurdity, that we have been deceived by the grossness of our perceptions. It is useless for us to invent instruments which * [This essay formed the bulk of the New Comment on AL I. 4.

On the above grounds, modern thinkers have endeavoured to create a distinction between the mathematical and the physical continuum, yet it should surely be obvious that the defect in our organs of sense, which is responsible for the difficulty, shows that our method of observation debars us from appreciating the true nature of things by this method of observation. However, in the case of the mathematical continuum, its character is such that we can continue indefinitely the process of division between any two mathematical expressions so-ever, without interfering in any way with the regularity of the process, or creating a condition in which two terms become indistinguishable from each other. The mathematical continuum, moreover, is not merely a question of series of integral numbers, but of other types of numbers, which, like integers, express relations between existing ideas, yet are not measurable in terms of that series. Such numbers are themselves parts of a continuum of their own, which interpenetrates the series of integers without touching it, at least necessarily. For example: the tangents of angles made by the separation of two lines from coincidence to perpendicularity, increases constantly from zero to infinity. But almost the only integral value is found at the angle of 45 degrees where it is unity. It may be said that there is an infinite number of such series, each possessing the same property of infinite divisibility. The ninety tangents of angles differing by one degree between zero and ninety may be multiplied sixty fold by taking the minute instead of the degree as the co-efficient of the progression, and these again sixty fold by introducing the second to divide the minute. So on ad infinitum. All these considerations depend upon the assumption that every number is no more than a statement of relation. The new conception,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 136indicated by the Book of the Law, is of course in no way contradictory of the orthodox view; but it adds to it in the most practically important manner. A statistician computing the birth-rate of the eighteenth century makes no special mention of the birth of Napoleon. This does not invalidate his results; but it demonstrates how exceedingly limited is their scope even with regard to their own object, for the birth of Napoleon had more influence on the death-rate than another other phenomenon included in his calculations. A short digression is necessary. There may be some who are still unaware of the fact, but the mathematical and physical sciences are in no sense concerned with absolute truth, but only with the relations between observed phenomena and the observer. The statement that the acceleration of falling bodies is thirty-two feet per second, is only the roughest of approximation at the best. In the first place, it applies to earth. As most people know, in the Moon the rate is only one-sixth as great. But, even on earth, it differs in a marked manner between the poles and the equator, and not only so, but it is affected by so small a matter as the neighborhood of a mountain. It is similarly inaccurate to speak of ìrepeatingî an experiment. The exact conditions never recur. One cannot boil water twice over. The water is not the same, and the observer is not the same. When a man says that he is sitting still, he forgets that he is whirling through space with vertiginous rapidity. It is possibly such considerations that led earlier thinkers to admit that there was no expectation of finding truth in anything but mathe-matics, and they rashly supposed that the apparent ineluctability of her laws constitutes a guarantee of their coherence with truth. But mathe-matics is entirely a matter of convention, no less so than the rules of Chess or Baccarat. When we say that ìtwo straight lines cannot enclose a space,î we mean no more than we are unable to think of them as doing so. The truth of the statement depends, consequently, on that of the hypothesis that our minds bear witness to truth. Yet the insane man may be unable to think that he is not the victim of mysterious perse-cution. We find that no reason for believing him.

It is a matter of elaborate and tedious training to persuade even the few people whom we teach of the truth of the simplest theorems in Geometry. There are very few people living who are convincedóor even awareóof the more recondite results of analysis. It is no reply to this criticism to say that all men can be convinced if they are sufficiently trained, for who is to guarantee that such training does not warp the mind? But when we have brushed away these preliminary objections, we find that the nature of the statement itself is not, and cannot be, more than a statement of correspondences between our ideas. In the example chosen, we have five ideas; those of duality, of straightness, of a line, of enclosing, and of space. None of these are more than ideas. Each one is meaningless until it is defined as corresponding in a certain manner to certain other ideas. We cannot define any word soever, except by identifying it with two or more equally undefined words. To define it by a single word would evidently constitute a tautology. We are thus forced to the conclusion that all investigation may be stigmatized as obscurum per obscurium. Logically, our position is even worse. We define A as BC, where B is DE, and C is FG. Not only does the process increase the number of our unknown quantities in Geometrical progression at every step, but we must ultimately arrive at a point where the definition of Z involves the term A. Not only is all argument confined within a vicious circle, but so is the definition of the terms on which any argument must be based. It might be supposed that the above chain of reasoning made all conclusions impossible. But this is only true when we investigate the ultimate validity of our propositions. We can rely on water boiling at 100 degrees Centigrade,* although, for mathematical accuracy, water never boils twice running at precisely the same temperature, and although, logically, the term water is an incomprehensible mystery. * In revising this comment, I note with amusement that it had escaped me that 100∞ C. is by definition the temperature at which water boils!

It has been one of the most important discoveries of modern mathematics, that this statement, even if we assume the definition of the various terms employed, is strictly relative, not absolute; and that common sense is impotent to confirm it as in the case of the boiling water. For Bolyai, Lobatschewsky, and Riemann have shown conclusively that a consistent system of geometry can be erected on any arbitrary axiom soever. If one chooses to assume that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is either greater than or less than two right angles, instead of equal to them, we can construct two new systems of Geometry, each perfectly consistent with itself, and we possess no means soever of deciding which of the three represents truth. I may illustrate this point by a simple analogy. We are accustomed to assert that we go from France to China, a form of expression which assumes that those countries are stationary, while we are mobile. But the fact might be equally well expressed by saying that France left us and China came to us. In either case there is no implication of absolute motion, for the course of the earth through space is not taken into account. We implicitly refer to a standard of repose which, in point of fact, we know not to exist. When I say that the chair in which I am sitting has remained stationary for the last hour, I mean only ìstationary in respect to myself and my house.î In reality, the earth's rotation has carried it over one thousand miles, and the earth's course some seventy thousand miles, from its previous position. All that we can expect of any statement is that it should be coherent with regard to a series of assumption which we know perfectly well to be false and arbitrary. It is commonly imagined, by those who have not examined the nature of the evidence, that our experience furnishes a criterion by which we may determine which of the possible symbolic represen-tations of Nature is the true one.

The most ordinary reflection should make it clear that our results depend upon all sorts of condition. If we inquire, ìWhat is the length of the thread of quicksilver in a thermo-meter?î, we can only reply that it depends on the temperature of the instrument. In fact, we judge temperature by the difference of the coefficients of expansion due to heat of the two substances, glass and mercury. Again, the divisions of the scale of the thermometer depend upon the temperature of boiling water, which is not a fixed thing. It depends on the pressure of the earth's atmosphere, which varies (according to time and place) to the extent of over twenty per cent. Most people who talk of ìscientific accuracyî are quite ignorant of elementary facts of this kind. It will be said, however, that having defined a yard as the length of a certain bar deposited in the Mint in London, under given conditions of temperature and pressure, we are at least in a position to measure the length of other objects by comparison, directly or indirectly, with that standard. In a rough and ready way, that is more or less the case. But if it should occur that the length of things in general were halved or doubled, we could not possibly be aware of the other so-called laws of Nature. We have no means so-ever of determining even so simple a matter as to whether one of two events happens before or after the other. Let us take an instance. It is well known that the light of the sun requires some eight minutes to reach the earth. Simultaneous* pheno-mena in the two bodies would therefore appear to be separated in time to that extent; and, from a mathematical standpoint, the same discrepancy theoretically exists, even if we suppose the two bodies in * Simultaneity, closely considered, possesses no meaning soever.

Recent consideration of these facts has show the impossibility of determining the fact of priority, so that it may be just as reasonable to assert that a dagger-thrust is caused by a wound as vice versa. Lewis Carroll has an amusing parable to this effect in Through the Looking-Glass, which work, by the way, with its predecessor, is packed with examples of philosophical paradox.* We may now return to our text ìEvery number is infinite.î The fact that every number is a term in a mathematical continuum is no more an adequate definition than if we were to describe a picture as Number So-and-So in the catalogue. Every number is a thing in itself,Ü possessing an infinite number of properties peculiar to itself. Let us consider, for a moment, the numbers 8 and 9. 8 is the number of cubes measuring one inch each way in a cube which measures two inches each way; while 9 is the number of squares measuring one inch each way in a square measuring three inches each way. There is a sort of reciprocal correspondence between them in this respect. By adding one to eight, we obtain nine, so that we might define unity as that which has the property of transforming a three-dimensional expansion of two into a two-dimensional expansion of three. But if we add unity to nine, unity appears as that which has the power of trans-forming the two-dimensional expansion of three aforesaid into a mere * If I strike a billiard ball, and it moves, both my will and its motion have causes long antecedent to the act. I may consider both my Work and its reaction as twin effects of the eternal Universe. The moved arm and ball are part of a state of the Cosmos which resulted necessarily from its momentarily previous state, and so, back for ever. Thus, my Magical Work is only on of the cause-effects necessarily concomitant with the cause-effects which set the ball in motion. I may therefore regard the act of striking as a cause-effect of my original Will to move the ball, though necessarily previous to its motion. But the case of Magical work is not quite analogous. For I am such that I am compelled to perform Magick in order to make my Will to prevail; so that the cause of my doing the Work is also he cause of the ball's motion, and there is no reason why one should precede the other, See Book 4, Part III, for a full discussion. (Since writing the above, I have been introduced to Space, Time and Gravitation, where similar arguments are adduced.) Ü I regret to find myself in disagreement with the Hon. Bertrand Russell with regard to the conception of the nature of Number."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A ëNUMBERí? 141oblong measuring 5 by 2. Unity thus appears as in possession of two totally different properties. Are we then to conclude that it is not the same unity? How are we to describe unity, how know it? Only by experiment can we discover the nature of its action on any given number. In certain minor respects, this action exhibits regularity. We know, for example, that it uniformly transforms an odd number into an even one, and vice versa, but that is practically the limit of what we can predict as to its action. We can go further, and state that any number soever possesses this infinite variety of powers to transform any other number, even by the primitive process of addition. We observe also how the manipulation of any two numbers can be arranged so that the result is incommensurable with either, or even so that ideas are created of a character totally incompatible with our original conception of numbers as a series of positive integers. We obtain unreal and irrational expressions, ideas of a wholly different order, by a very simple juxtaposition of such apparently comprehensible and commonplace entities as integers. There is only one conclusion to be drawn from these various considerations. It is that the nature of every number is a thing peculiar to itself, a thing inscrutable and infinite, a thing inexpressible, even if we could understand it. In other words, a number is a soul, in the proper sense of the term, an unique and necessary element in the totality of existence. We may now turn to the second phrase of the text: ìthere is no difference.î It must strike the student immediately that this is, on the face of it, a point blank contradiction of all that has been said above. What have we done but insist upon the essential difference between any two numbers, and show that even their sequential relation is little more than arbitrary, being indeed rather a convenient way of regarding them for the purpose of coordinating them with out understanding than anything else? On a similar principle, we number public vehicles or telephones without implication even of necessary sequence. The appellation denotes nothing beyond membership of a certain class of objects, and is indeed expressly chosen to avoid being entangled in"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 142considerations of any characteristics of the individual so designated except that cursory designation. When it is said that there is no difference between numbers (for in this sense I think we must understand the phrase), we must examine the meaning of the word ëdifference.í Difference is the denial of identity in the first place, but the word is not properly applied to discriminate between objects which have no similarity. One does not ask, ìWhat is the difference between a yard and a minute?î in practical life. We do ask the difference between two things of the same kind. The Book of the Law is trying to emphasize the doctrine that each number is unique and absolute. Its relations with other numbers are therefore in the nature of illusion. They are the forms of presentation under which we perceive their semblances; and it is to the last degree important to realize that these semblances only indicate the nature of the realities behind them in the same way in which the degrees on a thermometric scale indicate heat. It is quite unphilosophical to say that 50 degrees Centigrade is hotter than 40 degrees. Degrees of temperature are simply conventions invented by ourselves to describe physical states of a totally different order; and, while the heat of a body may be regarded as an inherent property of its own, our measure of that heat in no way concerns it. We use instruments of science to inform us of the nature of the various objects which we wish to study; but our observations never reveal the thing as it is in itself. They only enable us to compare unfamiliar with familiar experiences. The use of an instrument necessarily implies the imposition of alien conventions. To take the simplest example: when we say that we see a thing, we only mean that our consciousness is modified by its existence according to a particular arrangement of lenses and other optical instruments, which exist in our eyes and not in the object perceived. So also, the fact that the sum of 2 and 1 is three, affords us but a single statement of relations symptomatic of the presentation to us of those numbers. We have, therefore, no means soever of determining the difference between any two numbers, except in respect of a particular and very limited relation. Furthermore, in view of the infinity of every number,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A ëNUMBERí? 143it seems not unlikely that the apparent differences observed by us would tend to disappear with the disappearance of the arbitrary conditions which we attach to them to facilitate, as we think, our examination. We may also observe that each number, being absolute, is the centre of its universe, so that all other numbers, so far as they are related to it, are its appanages. Each number is, therefore, the totality of the universe, and there cannot be any difference between one infinite universe and another. The triangle ABC may look very different from the standpoints of A, B, and C respectively; each view is true, absolutely; yet it is the same triangle. The above interpretation of the text is of a revolutionary character, from the point of view of science and mathematics. Investigation of the lines here laid down will lead to the solution of these grave problems which have so long baffled the greatest minds of the world, on account of the initial error of attaching them on lines which involve self-contradiction. The attempt to discover the nature of things by a study of the relations between them is precisely parallel with the ambition to obtain a finite value of π. Nobody wishes to deny the practical value of the limited investigations which have so long preoccupied the human mind. But it is only quite recently that even the best thinkers have begun to recognize that their work was only significant within a certain order. It will soon be admitted on all hands that the study of the nature of things in themselves is a work for which the human reason is incompetent; for the nature of reason is such that it must always formulate itself in proportions which merely assert a positive or negative relation between a subject and a predicate. Men will thus be led to the development of a faculty, superior to reason, whose apprehension is independent of the hieroglyphic representations of which reason so vainly makes use.* This then will be the foundation of the true spiritual science which is the proper tendency of the evolution of man. This Science will clarify, without superseding, the old; but it will free men from the bondage of mind, little by little, just as the old science has freed them from the bondage of matter. * See ìEleusis,î A.

Further proof reading is probably required.] THIS ELECTRONIC EDITION of 777 Revised was prepared from the version printed in 777 and other Qabalistic Writings (originally published as The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley). As far as I can tell this was a facsimile from the 1955 first edition of 777 Revised; while Crowley’s original Preface was re-set in the 1955 edition, the Tables of Correspondence, Crowley’s notes thereon, and the appendix giving the trigrams and hexagrams of the I Ching were (with minor exceptions) in their turn straight facsimiles from the original 1909 edition of 777. The present edition includes all the material from 777 Revised [with the exception of Arabic material as noted above.] The 11 columns (CLXXXIV – CXCIV) added in 777 Revised were originally appended at the end of Table VI. Six were explanatory of or supplementary to existing columns: (e.g. numerations of Greek and Arabic letters, transliterations or translations; the “magical formulæ” column was specifically referred to the column of magical weapons); these have been placed immediately after the appropriate column. The others have been appended to the end of the appropriate table. While they are hence “out of sequence” I feel this is unlikely to cause confusion as these additional columns are rarely if ever directly referenced by number in other works. Very few of the columns in table IV had any attributions to line 0. This line has thus been omitted to save space in most of the blocks of columns making up that table. Additional correspondences as mentioned in Crowley’s remarks on the various columns have been inserted into the appropriate columns in double square brackets [[like this]]. Also added are: * Names and numeration of Coptic letters. * Transliterations of most Hebrew names. The more obscure of these are taken from Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia (3rd edition, Llewellyn, 1994), henceforth ‘Godwin’. * Translations of col. LXXVI and CXIX. * Crowley’s scheme of “Superior Planetary Governers” from Magick in Theory and Practice, which refers the outer planets to the Quaternions of the Signs. The other additional materials from 777 Revised have been included in what seemed to be appropriate places within this text. They are indicated by asterisks in the main Table of Contents. Most were key-entered by myself, the exception being “What is a ‘Number’” which was extracted from an electronic text of the Commentaries on Liber AL found online, entered by Bill Heidrick and others. I have made no attempt to preserve the original pagination. While Crowley occasionally referenced 777 by page number, such references are usually coupled with reference to the column. For ease of reading, columns are arranged from left to right across a single page. Obvious typos have been corrected; other questionable readings are noted below.

Forlong (1883). 3 The reference is probably to the Heptameron seu elementa magica, a 16th-century Grimoire of planetary magick (published with the Fourth Book of pseudo-Agrippa) deriving in part from the Solomonic cycle and in part from the Liber Juratus or Sworn Book of Honorius, a medieval work on magick (not to be confused with the early modern Grimoire of Honorius falsely attri-buted to the third Pope of that name). Its attribution to Pietro díAbano (1253-1316) is generally recognised as spurious. The uncontested works of díAbano do deal in part with astrological images and the medical / talismanic use of the same (vide Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic and Yates, Giordano Bruno), and he is occasionally cited as an authority by Renaissance writers such as Ficino and Agrippa; the material specifically attributed to díAbano in 777 is from the Heptameron, although the images of the decans may be from his genuine works. 4 A reference to the Golden Dawn. After swearing a long and tortuously phrased Oath of Secrecy, the Neophyte was issued a ìKnowledge Lectureî which consisted of the names and symbols of the Elements, Planets and Signs along with the Hebrew Alphabet and the names of the Sephiroth in Hebrew. 5 The Lemegeton is a 17th-century compilation, probably English, of magical texts attributed to Solomon. The first book, Goetia, describes 72 ìEvil Spiritsî and gives instructions for evoking them (it derives variously from the Key of Solomon, the Heptameron, the Fourth Book of pseudo-Agrippa and the Pseudomonarchia DÊmonum published by Wier). Crowley published an edition in 1904, from a text prepared by Mathers which had circulated in MS. in the Golden Dawn. In cols. CLV ñ CLXVI the spirits are referred to the Decans by day and night. The second book, Theurgia Goetia, lists 31 principal spirits, with an astronomical number of subordinates of whom few are named; of the 31, 20 are referred to the points of the compass and the other 11 are said to wander and have no fixed place. They are said to be partly evil and party good, hence the apparently oxymoronic title. It is possible that the Theurgia-Goetia was based on the Steganographia of Trithemius by someone who did not realise that the latter was primarily a work of cryptography. The third book, Ars Paulina, contains a catalogue of Angels for the 12 hours of the day and night, and for the 12 signs and 360 degrees of the Zodiac; they are also attributed to the seven classical Planets. The fourth book, Ars Almadel, is probably of medieval origin: it divides up the powers it summons into four ìAltitudesî, seemingly referred to the cardinal points of the Zodiac. The ìfifth book of the Lemegetonî, Ars Nova, is rather a kind of appendix which appears in one MS. where it occupies one and a half sides of a single folio leaf: it contains an extended prayer associated with the names on the circle and triangle of the Goetia, possibly intended to be spoken while drawing these, along with a short and garbled conjuration containing some highly corrupt Hebrew names, probably also connected with the Goetia as it mentions the brazen vessel; and finally, a lengthy curse targetted at anyone who steals the book. The Ars Nova is sometimes confused with the Ars Notoria (Notary Art) attributed to Solomon, which latter rather appears to be a medieval magical derivative of classical art of memory, based around the contemplation of images or notÊ while repeating prayers. The Ars Notoria was condemned by Aquinas (cited in Yates, Art of Memory) and various Renaissance writers such as Erasmus and Agrippa (in De vanitate &c.); Robert Turner produced an English translation which was made less than useful by the omission of the figures: this translation has been incorporated into some later MSS. and printed editions of the Lemegeton."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 146 6 In The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage (lib. II cap. XIX) are tabulated the names of various Evil Spirits: chief among these are the ìFour Princes and Superior Spiritsî, to wit Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan and Belial who may perhaps be referred to the Elements (I would suggest Fire, Water, Air, Earth respectively); immediately below these are eight ìSub-Princesî, namely Oriens, Paimon, Ariton, Amaimon (vide 777 col. LXVIII), Astarot, Magot, Asmodee and Beelzebud (sic); a total of 316 named spirits are listed below the eight Sub-Princes, some subject to one, some shared between two or more. 7 The Book of the Concourse of the Forces is the title of a collection of Golden Dawn papers loosely based on the ìEnochianî material which emerged from the ceremonial skrying of John Dee and Edward Kelly. Crowley later published a terse and incomplete abstract of this material as ìA brief abstract of the symbolic representation of the Universeî in Equinox I (7-8). See also Regardie (ed.)

Transliterations of Egyptian names have been left as in the first edition. These differ from both modern transliterations and those employed by early 20th-century writers such as Budge. Line 1: Asar is better known by the Hellenized form Osiris; Asar-un-Nefer (ìOsiris the beautifulî) was a epiphet or title of this god. Hadith in this line (also Hadit in line 0) is not a historical Egyptian deity but refers to the entity described in cap. II of The Book of the Law; the name is a garbled or corrupt form of Heru-Behutet (Horus of Behutet), a solar-martial form of Horus symbolized by the winged disk. Heru-Ra-Ha is not a historical Egyptian deity but is mentioned in cap. III of The Book of the Law and is said to combine Hoor-par-Kraat (Horus the Child) and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Ra-Horus of the Two Horizons). Line 6: ìOnî was not an Egyptian deity but a transliteration into Hebrew (}a or }wa) of the name of the Egyptian solar cult-centre called Heliopolis by the Greeks.

Mau is onomatopúic Egyptian for ëcatí and appears to have been an epiphet of Ra. Line 22: Ma more usually spelt Maat or Maíat. Lines 23, 31: Auramoth and Thoum-aesh-neith were never Egyptian deities but were names constructed on Qabalistic principles by the Golden Dawn to refer to water and fire; similarly the name Tarpesheth (Tharpesht) is unknown prior to G.D. material, although she appears to be a hybrid of Bast and Sekhet. Hekar is possible Hequet or Hekt. Line 24: Typhon was a Titan in Greek myth (son of Tartaros and Gaia), probably a personification of destructive forces of nature, who was identified with Set in late classical times. Add Selket, whose symbol was the scorpion. The attribution of Khephra is explained by Crowleyís remarks on this line in the ìAnimalsî column. Line 25: Add Neith (Net) who is traditionally depicted with a bow and arrows. Line 26: Khem is identified by Budge (op. cit., I, 97) with the phallic god Min or Amsu, and was identified by the Greeks with Pan. Line 28: Ahephi is Hapi, one of the Children of Horus. Line 29: Add Hequet (Hekt). Line 31: Kabeshunt is probably Qebhsennuf, one of the Children of Horus. Line 32: Mako (or Makou), son of Set, is a mythological crocodile; the name appears in the Harris Magic Papyrus (19th or 20th Dynasty), in the course of a charm against crocodiles addressed to Shu. In the Golden Dawn Z1 paper the Children of Horus or Canopic Gods had ëinvisible stationsí in the corners of the Temple. The most immediate source for the elemental attributions, though, is the Golden Dawn paper on ìEnochian Chessî where the four pawns of each side are referred to these God-forms. It is not clear why Crowley omitted Tuamutef for Water (a G.D. Coptic form of this name is cited in connection with the ìEagle Kerubî in a ritual in Equinox I (3)). In a myth recounted by Budge (op. cit. vol. I p. 158) these gods are said to have grasped the four pillars of heaven as sceptres: Amset the South, Hapi the North, Tuamutef the East, and Qebhsennuf the West. They were also said to guard the Canopic Jars in which the internal organs of the deceased were preserved, and their G.D. attributions to the cross-quarters probably derive from a single find of an Egyptian tomb which had the four jars with the images of the gods disposed thus.

The translations of the Seven Heavens are mostly from Godwinís Cabalistic Encyclopedia, s.v. ìHeaven.î Col. CIII. This column originally printed in Latin (from Kabbala Denudata, tom. I, par. IV, fig xvi (P).). Col. CVIII. For what itís worth (probably not much; see Crowleyís note), here are translite-rations of the Hebrew names in this column: Line 2. Samael (ìpoison of Godî or ìblind godî). lams = 131 = Pan. Line 3. Isheth Zanunim (Woman of Whore-dom), said to be the wife of Samael. \\ynwnz tca = 864 = \\ycdq cwdq, Qadosh Qadeshim, Holy of Holies. Doubtless there is an Arcanum concealed here, possibly along the lines of ìyou can prove anything with Gematria if you try hard enough.î Line 5. Ashteroth. Historically a Middle East-ern goddess (Ishtar, AstartÈ, Asherah, etc.), denounced and maliciously mis-spelt by Old Testament writers and given an inexplicable sex change by medieval demonologists."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 150 Line 6. Chiva, the Beast; said to be the off-spring of Samael and Isheth Zanunim (see Mathersí introduction to Kaballah Unveiled, para 61). Only a hideous fudge (to wit (a) mis-spelling the name as ahija, (b) writing each letter out in full and (c) counting hÈ in full as ah rather than the more usual hh) can get this name to add to 666. Line 7. Asmodai. Appears in the apocryphal Book of Tobit. Sometimes also known by the Latinised form Asmodeus. The name is possibly a modification of Aeshma Deva, an evil spirit from Persian mythology. Line 8. Belial. Said to be the chief of the evil spirits in some late Jewish apocalyptic liter-ature (e.g. the Testament of the 12 Patriarchs), but in the Old Testament the name was a mere term of abuse meaning ìmasterlessî or ìworthless.î Line 9. Lilith. She gets everywhere. Line 10. Naamah. The sister of Tubal-Cain (see Masonic symbolism); but in the Zohar she gets turned into another version of Lilith. Col. CIX. Rather than use planetary symbols to distinguish the Kings and Dukes as in the printed edition, I have split this column. For Daath add King Bela son of Beor (rwob }b olb) and Dukes Timnah (oamt), Alvah (hwlo) and Jetheth (tty). Col. CX. Line 1. Ruach Elohim Chayyim, the Spirit of the Living Gods. The first edition of 777 had as a subtitle \\yyj \\yhla hwr tja, Achath Ruach Elohim Chayyim (ìone [is] the Spirit of the Living Elohimî), a line from the Sepher Yetzirah which adds to 777. Cols. CXII ñ CXIII. These sets of attributions were extracted by the Golden Dawn from the first volume of Kabbala Denudata. The symbols in 7 and 8 apparently represent ìhermaphroditic Brass.î Col. CXIV. The numbers are an addition; each password adds to the ìmystic numberî of the Sephirah corresponding. Vide Col. X. Col. CXV. The entries in this column were originally given as initials only. Col. CXIX. I have added translations, based on those in the ìBuddhist Dictionaryî (see note to col. LXXVI). In ìScience and Buddhism,î Crowley glosses Udhakka as ìSelf-righteousness.î Col. CXXI. These are Golden Dawn titles. The A∴A∴ titles in the 1st order differ slightly; 0∞=08 is Probationer, 1∞=108 is Neophyte, 2∞=98 Zelator and the ìwaitingî grade between Philosophus and Adeptus Minor is called Dominus Liminis. Cols. CXXIX ñ CXXXII. These are the Angels of the Shem ha-Mephorash or 72-fold Divided Name of God, a full explanation of which would be beyond the scope of this footnote. See Godwin, s.v. ìShem ha-Mephorash.î On each row, the name on the left rules the card in question by day, the one on the right by night. Cols. CXXXIII ñ CXXXVI. Words in square brackets are the Book of Thoth keywords for these cards where these differ from the titles. Table V (the Zodiac) Col. CXXXIX. The outer planets ñ Uranus ((), Nepture ()) and Pluto (*) and the Nodes of the Moon were not given in this table in 777, but appeared in these positions in the table ìThe Essential Dignities of the Planetsî in The Book of Thoth (reproduced in diagrammatic form in ìVarious Arrangements,î p. 41). Col. CXXXIXa. This data in this column appeared in Appendix V of Magick, with the title of col. CXXXIX erroneously placed at its head (MTP had ìP.M.î for Primum Mobile where this has Pluto, not then discovered). The scheme also appears in The Book of Thoth, appendix B. Cols. CXLIX ñ CLI. Agrippa (tom. II cap. xxxvii) gives a somewhat different set of images for the decans, along with the significance of each. It is believed Agrippa derived from Latin translations of the Picatrix, a medieval Arabic work on magic. The images given here are close to those printed by Regardie in Complete Golden Dawn, and thus probably represent those circulating in the G.D. (possibly deriving from Petro díAbano), though Regardie also gave the signification of each image (similar but not always identical to those in Agrippa). Cols. CLV ñ CLXVI. I have added translit-erations of the names of the spirits and numbers"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"TRANSCRIBERíS ENDNOTES 151 according to the order in which they appear in the Goetia. Planetary symbols indicate the rank of the spirit and the material from which its seal is to be made (some spirits have two ranks), thus (the original text has the seals of Earls made in mixed copper and silver; Mathers suggests copper/silver or silver/mercury alloy for the Presidents): Rank Planet Metal Knight Saturn Lead Prince Jupiter Tin Earl Mars Iron King Sol Gold Duke Venus Copper President Mercury Mercury (hmmÖ) Marquis Luna Silver In rendering the names of the demons into Hebrew, some suffixes like ñion, ñius, etc. have been dropped. An alternative set of attributions and Hebrew spellings can be found in The Sword and the Serpent by Denning and Phillips, and Godwinís Cabalistic Encyclopedia. Cols. CLXVII ñ CLXXI. A completely different set of names for the dekans and the gods referred to them may be found in Budgeís Gods of the Egyptians, vol. ii pp 304-310. I am unaware of Crowleyís source for these attributions: generally the names seem somewhat Hellenized. Notes to Crowley’s notes 1 Because jk = Koch, Power, and hm is the ìsecret nameî of Yetzirah (vide Col. LXIV). 2 i.e., the Hebrew word for ìten.î 3 The G.D. Qliphoth lecture (as published by Zalewski, etc.) has }wdba, Abaddon; Crowleyís reading matches that in Kabbala Denudata (tom. I par. IV fig. xvi (Y)); although this entity is there described as innominatus, ënamelessí or ëunnamed.í 4 The print edition had hmok; this has been assumed to be an error for Naamah or Nahemah (see also col. CVIII); the reading given follows Von Rosenroth (loc. cit.) which is the source for this as for so much else in 777. 5 ìRosicrucian Chessî is also known as ìEno-chian Chessî although its connection with Dee and Kellyís magick is tenuous at best; it is a four- handed game also used as a system of divination, loosely based on an ancient Indian game called Chaturanga, with pieces representing Egyptian Gods, played on an 8 by 8 board said to represent one of the four Watchtowers (with about half the squares omitted to get it the right size). For a more detailed account see Zalewski, Enochian Chess of the Golden Dawn (Llewellyn). Rather than attempt to transliterate and then decipher the Coptic names given by Crowley (some of which I suspect are corrupt or mis-printed) I will give the versions of these names as listed in Regardie (ed.), Complete G.D. (lib. X pp. 113-4). In many cases these are not reasonable transliterations of the names printed in 777. Fire: Bishop: Toum. Queen: Sati-Ashtoreth. Knight: Ra. Castle: Anouke (possibly Ankhet, a title of Isis) King: Kneph (Khnemu). Water: Bishop: Hapimon (the Nile god) Queen: Thouerist (Ta-urt the hippopotamus goddess) Knight: Sebek Castle: Shu King: Osiris Air: Bishop: Shu Queen: Knousou Knight: Seb Castle: Tharpesht (a G.D. amalgam of Bast and Sekhet) King: Socharis (Seker; an early god who became identified with Ptah, and later with Osiris) Earth: Bishop: Aroueris Queen: Isis Knight: Hoori (Horus) Castle: Nephthys King: Aeshoori (i.e. Osiris again) Pawns Knightís pawn: Kabexnuv (Qebhsennuf) Queenís Pawn: Tmoumathph (sic) (Tuamutef) Bishopís Pawn: Ahepi (Hapi) Rookís Pawn: Ameshet (Mestha)"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"777 REVISED 152 6 I cannot identify the first three of these names. I believe the remaining four were intended to be G.D. Coptic spellings of Hapi (Ahephi), Tuamutef (Toumathph), Mestha (Ameshett) and Qebhsennuf (Kabexnuv), the Sons of Horus, and have corrected them accordingly. 7 De. occ. phil. lib. I. cap xxiii. The following six chapters list various things said to be under the power of the other six classical planets. See also cap. xxii which gives general attributions for the planets and the theory behind all this, and cap. xxxii, ìWhat things are under the Signs, the Fixed Stars, and their images.î 8 On typographic and chronological evidence this line was an addition in 777 Revised. 9 As noted above, this last is a fudge which was made necessary by someone miscopying the name of the Intelligence of the Intelligences of the Moon so it no longer added to 3321. 10 The Golden Dawn lectures give a slightly different attribution of the fingers, based on the points of the Pentagram, thus: the thumb to Spirit, the index to Water, the medius to Fire, the third finger to Earth and the little finger to Air. 11 In the Golden Dawn diagram (in turn derived from a figure in plate XVI in tom. i of von Rosenrothís Kabbala Denudata) from which Col. CVI. was derived, the seven Earths of Col. CIV. were also enclosed by the four seas. Godwin refers the Infernal Rivers to the Elements thus: Air, Cocytus; Water, Styx; Fire, Phlegethon; Earth, Acheron. 12 ìheled, concealed, and never revealed.î See the Oath of an Entered Apprentice Freemason. 13 The names appear in a supplement to the Rituel de Haute Magie as part of an ìexplanationî of the ìNuctemeron of Apollonius of Tyana.î In cap. XVII of the Rituel Levi gives the names and characters of another 24 Zodiacal genii, two for each sign. The latter are here omitted. 14 i.e., the author of the Heptameron (see note to Preface on this point). But much of the following derives from the Liber Juratus in any case. 15 I have reduced this into a single table to save space, representing each day and Angel with the corresponding planetary symbol. 16 The names here have been conformed to the version of the Heptameron printed in the Lyons edition of Agrippaís Opera. Crowley, possibly because he was working from a corrupted copy, stated that none were given for Winter; although the names he gave for the Sun and Moon in Autumn were those referred to Winter by pseudo-Abano. Appendix: the Yi King Transliterations of Chinese names follow the system used by Legge in Sacred Books of the East, which is not in general current use. In particular, note that consonants have different phonetic values when italicised (K is ìthin (tenuis) modified guttural consonantî, Kh ìaspirated thin modified gutturalî). b represents the ëneutralí vowel sound. Where Crowley has ëtzí, Legge used a character something like a stylised 3; but as far as I can tell from the table of transliteration conventions, this is equivalent to the Hebrew x (described helpfully as ìSpiritus asperrimus 2î under dental consonants). While this may be a little awkward and confusing, I would submit it is to be preferred to a transliteration scheme which manages to give the same transliteration for two different Chinese characters (vide the Wilhelm-Baynes I Ching, s.v. Hexagram 63). The main traditional glosses to the trigrams are: 7 Heaven, sky 6 Water (marsh or lake) 5 Fire, sun, lightning 4 Thunder 3 Wind and wood 2 Water (rain, clouds, springs), moon 1 Hill or mountain 0 Earth Additional traditional correspondences can be found in the ìEighth Wingî (Appendix V. in the Legge edition, ìShuo Kwa / Discussion of the Trigramsî in Part II of the Wilhelm-Baynes edition). *** ***** ***"}]
