Sir Palamede, the Saracen knight, riding on the shore of Syria, findeth his fatherís corpse, around which an albatross circleth. He approveth the vengeance of his peers. ii. On the shore of Arabia he findeth his mother in the embrace of a loathly negro beneath blue pavilions. Her he slayeth, and burneth all that encampment. iii. Sir Palamede is besieged in his castle by Severn mouth, and his wife and son are slain. iv. Hearing that his fall is to be but the prelude to an attack of Camelot, he maketh a desperate night sortie, and will traverse the wilds of Wales. v. At the end of his resources among the Welsh mountains, he is compelled to put to death his only remaining child. By this sacrifice he saves the world of chivalry. vi. He having become an holy hermit, a certain dwarf, splendidly clothed, cometh to Arthurís court, bearing tidings of a Questing Beast. The knights fail to lift him, this being the test of worthiness. vii. Lancelot findeth him upon Scawfell, clothed in his white beard. he returneth, and, touching the dwarf but with his finger, herleth him to the heaven. viii. Sir Palamede, riding forth on the quest, seeth a Druid worship the sun upon Stonehenge. He rideth eastward, and findeth the sun setting in the west. Furious he taketh a Viking ship, and by sword and whip fareth seaward. ix. Coming to India, he learneth that It glittereth. Vainly fighting the waves,the leaves, and the snows, he is swept in the Himalayas as by an avalanche into a valley where dwell certain ascetics, who pelt him with their eyeballs. x. Seeking It as Majesty, he chaseth an elephant in the Indian jungle. The elephant escapeth; but he, led to Trichinopoli by an Indian lad, seeth an elephant forced to dance ungainly before the Mahalingam. xi. A Scythian sage declareth that It transcendeth Reason. Therefore Sir Palamede unreasonably decapitateth him. xii. An ancient hag prateth of It as Evangelical. Her he hewed in pieces."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SIR PALAMDES, THE SARACEN KNIGHT vi xiii. At Naples he thinketh of the Beast as author of Evil, because Free of Will. The Beast, starting up, is slain by him with a poisoned arrow; but at the moment of Its death It is reborn from the knightís own belly. xiv. At Rome he meeteth a red robber in a Hat, who speaketh nobly of It as of a king-dove-lamb. He chaseth and slayeth it; it proves but a child's toy. xv. In a Tuscan grove he findeth, from the antics of a Satyr, that the Gods sill dwell with men. Mistaking orgasm for ecstasty, he is found ridiculous. xvi. Baiting for It with gilded corn in a moonlit vale of Spain, he findeth the bait stolen by vermin. xvii. In Crete a metaphysician weaveth a labyrinth. Sir Palamede compelleth him to pursue the quarry in this same fashion. Running like hippogriffs, they plunge over the precipice; and the hermit, dead, appears but a mangy ass. Sir Palamede, sore wounded, is borne by fishers to an hut. xviii. Sir Palamede noteth the swiftness of the Beast. He therefore climbeth many mountains of the Alps. Yet can he not catch It; It outrunneth him easily, and at last, stumbling, he falleth. xix. Among the dunes of Brittany he findeth a witch dancing and conjuring, until she disappeareth in a blaze of light. He then learneth music, from a vile girl, until he is as skilful as Orpheus. In Paris he playeth in a public place. The people, at first throwing him coins, soon desert him to follow a foolish Egyptian wizard. No Beast cometh to his call. xx. He argueth out that there can be but one Beast. Following single tracks, he at length findeth the quarry, but on pursuit It eldueth him by multiplying itself. This on the wide plains of France. xxi. He gathereth an army sufficient to chase the whole herd. In Englandís midst they rush upon them; but the herd join together, leading on the kinghts, who at length rush together into a mÍlÈe, wherein all but Sir Palamede are slain, while the Beast, as ever, standeth aloof, laughing. xxii. He argueth Its existence from design of the Cosmos, noting that Its tracks form a geometrical figure. But seeth that this depends upon his sense of geometry; and is therefore no proof. Meditating upon this likeness to himselfóIts subjectivity, in shortóhe seeth It in the Blue Lake. Thither plunging, all is shattered. xxiii. Seeking It in shrines he findeth but a money-box; while they that helped him (as they said) in his search, but robbed him."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" vii xxiv. Arguing Its obscurity, he seeketh It within the bowels of Etna, cutting off all avenues of sense. His own thoughts pursue him into madness. xxv. Upon the Pacific Ocean, he, thinking that It is not-Self, throweth himself into the sea. But the Beast setteth him ashore. xxvi. Rowed by Kanakas to Japan, he praiseth the stability of Fuji-Yama. But, an earthquake arising, the pilgrims are swallowed up. xxvii. Upon the Yang-tze-kiang he contemplateth immortal change. Yet, perceiving that the changes themselves constitute stability, he is again baulked, and biddeth his men bear him to Egypt. xxviii. In an Egyptian temple he hath performed the Bloody Sacrifice, and cursed Osiris. Himself suffering that curse, he is still far from the Attainment. xxix. In the land of Egypt he performeth many miracles. But from the statue of Memnon issueth the questing, and he is recalled from that illusion. xxx. Upon the plains of Chaldea he descendeth into the bowels of the earth, where he beholdeth the Visible Image of the soul of Nature for the Beast. Yet Earth belcheth him forth. xxxi. In a slum city he converseth with a Rationalist. Learning nothing, nor even hearing the Beast, he goeth forth to cleanse himself. xxxii. Seeking to imitate the Beast, he goeth on all-fours, questing horribly. The townsmen cage him for a lunatic. Nor can he imitate the elusiveness of the Beast. Yet at one note of that questing the prison is shattered, and Sir Palamede rusheth forth free. xxiii. Sir Palamede hath gone to the shores of the Middle Sea to restore his health. There he practiseth devotion to the Beast, and becometh maudlin and sentimental. His knaves mocking him, he beateth one sore; from whose belly issueth the questing. xxiv. Being retired into an hermitage in Fenland, he traverseth space upon the back of an eagle. He knoweth all thingsósave only It. And incontinent beseedheth the eagle to set him down again. xxxv. He lectureth upon metaphysicsófor he is now totally insaneóto many learned monks of Cantabrig. They applaud him and detain him, though he hath heard the questing and would away. But so feeble is he that he fleeth by night. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SIR PALAMDES, THE SARACEN KNIGHT viii xxxvi. It hath often happened to Sir Palamede that he is haunted by a shadow, the which he may not recognise. But at last, in a sunlit wood, this is discovered to be a certain hunchback, who doubteth whether there be at all any Beast or any quest, or if the whole life of Sir Palamede be not a vain illusion. Him, without seeing to conquer with words, he slayeth incontinent. xxxvii. In a cave by the sea, feeding on limpets androots, Sir Palamede abideth, sick unto death. Himseemeth the Beast questeth within his own bowels; he is the Beast. Standing up, that he may enjoy the reward, he findeth another answer to the riddle. Yet abideth in the quest. xxxviii. Sir Palamede is confronted by a stranger knight, whose arms are his own, as also his features. This knight mocketh Sir Palamede for an impudent pretender, and impersonator of the chosen knight. Sir Palamede in all humility alloweth that there is no proof possible, and offereth ordeal of battle, in which the stranger is slain. Sir Palamede heweth him into the smallest dust without pity. xxxix. In a green valley he obtaineth the vision of Pan. Thereby he regaineth all that he had expended of strength and youth; is gladdened thereat, for he now devoteth again his life to the quest; yet more utterly cast down than ever, for that this supreme vision is not the Beast. xl. Upon the loftiest summit of a great mountain he perceiveth Naught. Even this is, however, not the Beast. xli. Returning to Camelot to announce his failure, he maketh entrance into the King's hall, whence he started out upon the quest. The Beast cometh nestling to him. All the knights attain the quest. The voice of Christ is heard: ìwell done.î He sayeth that each failure is a step in the Path. The poet prayeth success therein for himself and his readers.

Armed to the teeth, the glittering kinght Galloped along the sounding shore, His silver arms one lake of light, Their clash one symphony of war. How still the blue enamoured sea Lay in the blaze of Syria's noon! The eternal roll eternally Beat out its monotonic tune. Sir Palamede the Saracen A dreadful vision here espied, A sight abhorred of gods and men, Between the limit of the tide. The dead manís tongue was torn away; The dead manís throat was slit across; There flapped upon the putrid prey A carrion, screaming albatross. So halted he his horse, and bent To catch remembrance from the eyes That stared to God, whose ardour sent His radiance from the ruthless skies."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LIBER CXCVII 4Then like a statue still he sate; Nor quivered nerve, nor muscle stirred; While round them flapped insatiate The fell, abominable bird.

For Palamede those eyes beheld The iron image of his own; On those dead brows a fate he spelled To strike a Gorgon into stone. He knew his father. Still he sate, Nor quivered nerve, nor muscle stirred; While round them flapped insatiate The fell, abominable bird. The knight approves the justice done, And pays with that his rowelsí debt; While yet the forehead of the son Stands beaded with an icy sweat.

Now when a year and day are done Sir Palamedes is aware Of blue pavilions in the sun, And bannerets fluttering in the air. Forward he spurs; his armour gleams; Then on his haunches rears the steed; Above the lordly silk there streams The pennon of Sir Palamede! Aflame, a bridegroom to his spouse, He rides to meet with galliard grace Some scion of his holy house, Or germane to his royal race. But oh! the eyes of shame!

She looks and laughs upon the knight, Then turns to buss the blubber mouth, Draining the dregs of that black blight Of wine to ease their double drouth! God! what a glance! Sir Palamede Is stricken by the sword of fate: His mother it is in very deed That gleeful goes the goatish gait. His mother it his, that pure and pale Cried in the pangs that gave him birth; The holy image he would veil From aught the tiniest taint of earth. She knows him, and black fear bedim Those eyes; she offers to his gaze The blue-veined breasts that suckled him In childhoodís sweet and solemn days. Weeping she bares the holy womb!

Their numbers thin; their strength decays; Their fate is written plain to read: These are the dread deciduous days Of iron-souled Sir Palamede. He hears the horrid laugh that rings From camp to camp at night; he hears The cruel mouths of murderous kings Laugh out one menace that he fears. No sooner shall the heroes die Than, ere their flesh begin to rot, The heathen turns his raving eye To Caerlon and Camelot. King Arthur in ignoble sloth Is sunk, and dalliance with his dame, Forgetful of his knightly oath, And careless of his kingly name.

In Afric they that chase the ostrich Clothe them with feathers, subtly foil Its vigilance, come close, then dart Its death upon it. Brave my heart! Do thus!î And so the knight disguises Himself, on hands and knees doth start His hunt, goes questing up and down. So in the fields the peasant clown Flies, shrieking, from the dreadful figure. But when he came to any town They caged him for a lunatic. Quod he: ìWould God I had the trick! The beast escaped from my devices; I will the same. The bars are thick, But I am strong.î He wrenched in vain; Thenówhat is this? What wild, sharp strain Smites on the air? The prison smashes. Hark! ítis the Questing Beast again!

Listless, he aches; his purpose swims Exhausted in the oily seas Of laxity and lassitude. The soul subsides; its serious motion Still throbs; by habit, not by will. And all his lust to win the quest Is but a passive-mild devotion. (Ay! soon the blood shall run right chill óAnd is not death the Lord of Rest?)

It was by night that Palamede Ran from that mildewed, mouldy breed, Moth-eathen dullards run to seed! How weak Sir Palamedes grows! We hear no more of bouts and blows! His weapons are his ten good toes! He that was Arthurís peer, good knight Proven in many a foughten fight, Flees like a felon in the night!

Moreover, though he sought to scan Some feature, though he listened long, No shape of God or fiend or man, No whisper, groan, shriek, scream, or song Gave him to know it. Now it chanced One day Sir Palamedes rode Through a great wood whose leafage danced In the thin sunlight as it flowed From heaven. He halted in a glade, Bade his horse crop the tender grass; Put off his armour, softly laid Himself to sleep till noon should pass. He woke.

Then, since the thinker must be dumb, At least the knight may knightly act: The wisest monk in Christendom May have his skull broke by a fact.î With that, as a snake strikes, his sword Leapt burning to the burning blue; And fell, one swift, assured award, Stabbing that hunchback through and through.
