[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Liber DCCCXXXVII{Book 837}The Lawof LibertyA Tract of TO MEGA VHRION 666That is a Magus 9°=2 A.∙.A.∙.This Epistle first appeared in The Equinox III(1) (Detroit: Universal, 1919), and is anexpository commentary on Liber Legis­­The Book of the Law, from which the quotations aretaken.­­H.B.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.II AM OFTEN ASKED why I begin my letters in this way. No matter whether I am writingto my lady or to my butcher, always I begin with these eleven words. Why, how else should Ibegin? What other greeting could be so glad? Look, brother, we are free! Rejoice with me,sister, there is no law beyond Do what thou wilt!III WRITE this for those who have not read our Sacred book, The Book of the Law, or forthose who, reading it, have somehow failed to understand its perfection. For there are manymatters in this Book, and the Glad Tidings are now here, now there, scattered throughout theBook as the Stars are scattered through the field of Night. Rejoice with me, all ye people! Atthe very head of the Book stands the great charter of our godhead: ``Every man and everywoman is a star.'' We are all free, all independent, all shining gloriously, each one a radiantworld. Is not that good tidings?Then comes the first call of the Great Goddess Nuit, Lady of the Starry Heaven, who is alsoMatter in its deepest metaphysical sense, who is the infinite in whom all we live and moveand have our being. Hear Her first summons to us men and women: ``Come forth, o children,under the stars, & take your fill of love! I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours.My joy is to see your joy.'' Later She explains the mystery of sorrow: ``For I am divided forlove's sake, for the chance of union.''``This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy ofdissolution all.''"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It is shown later how this can be, how death itself is an ecstasy like love, but more intense, thereunion of the soul with its true self.And what are the conditions of this joy, and peace, and glory? Is ours the gloomy asceticismof the Christian, and the Buddhist, and the Hindu? Are we walking in eternal fear lest some``sin'' should cut us off from ``grace''? By no means.``Be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines andwines that foam! Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and withwhom ye will! But always unto me.''This is the only point to bear in mind, that every act must be a ritual, an act of worship, asacrament. Live as the kings and princes, crowned and uncrowned, of this world, havealways lived, as masters always live; but let it not be self­indulgence; make your self­indulgence your religion.When you drink and dance and take delight, you are not being ``immoral,'' you are not``risking your immortal soul''; you are fulfilling the precepts of our holy religion­­providedonly that you remember to regard your actions in this light. Do not lower yourself and destroyand cheapen your pleasure by leaving out the supreme joy, the consciousness of the Peacethat passeth understanding. Do not embrace mere Marian or Melusine; she is Nuit Herself,specially concentrated and incarnated in a human form to give you infinite love, to bid youtaste even on earth the Elixir of Immortality. ``But ecstasy be thine and joy of earth: ever Tome! To me!''Again She speaks: ``Love is the law, love under will.'' Keep pure your highest ideal; striveever toward it without allowing aught to stoÿ you or turn you aside, even as a star sweepsupon its incalculable and infinite course of glory, and all is Love. The Law of your beingbecomes Light, Life, Love and Liberty. All is peace, all is harmony and beauty, all is joy.For hear, how gracious is the Goddess; ``I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, notfaith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught insacrifice.''Is this not better than the death­in­life of the slaves of the Slave­ Gods, as they go oppressedby consciousness of ``sin,'' wearily seeking or simulating wearisome and tedious ``virtues''?With such, we who have accepted the Law of Thelema have nothing to do. We have heardthe Voice of the Star­Goddess: ``I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled orvoluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desireyou. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me!'' And thusShe ends:``Sing the rapturous love­song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink tome, for I love you! I love you! I am the blue­ lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the nakedbrilliance of the voluptuous night­sky. To me! To me!'' And with these words ``The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Manifestation of Nuit is at an end.''IIIIN THE NEXT CHAPTER of our book is given the word of Hadit, who is the complementof Nuit. He is eternal energy, the Infinite Motion of Things, the central core of all being. Themanifested Universe comes from the marriage of Nuit and Hadit; without this could no thingbe. This eternal, this perpetual marriage­feast is then the nature of things themselves; andtherefore everything that is, is a crystallization of divine ecstasy.Hadit tells us of Himiself: ``I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core ofevery star.'' He is then your own inmost divine self; it is you, and not another, who are lost inthe constant rapture of the embraces of Infinite Beauty. A little further on He speaks of us:``We are not for the poor and the sad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk.''``Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shall rejoice, our chosen: whosorroweth is not of us.''``Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.'' Later,concerning death, He says: ``Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verilythou shalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the King dissolve, heshall remain in pure ecstasy for ever.'' When you know that, what is left but delight? Andhow are we to live meanwhile?``It is a lie, this folly against self.'' {...} ``Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense andrapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.''Again and again, in words like these, He sees the expansion and the develoÿment of the soulthrough joy.Here is the Calendar of our Church: ``But ye, o my people, rise up & awake! Let the ritualsbe rightly performed with joy & beauty!'' Remember that all acts of love and pleasure arerituals, must be rituals. ``There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times. A feast forthe first night of the Prophet and his Bride! A feast for the three days of the writing of theBook of the Law. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet­­secret, o Prophet! A feastfor the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods. A feast for fire and a feastfor water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death! A feast every day in your hearts in thejoy of my rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight! Aye!feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is the dissolution, and eternal ecstasy in thekisses of Nu.'' It all depends on your own acceptance of this new law, and you are not askedto believe anything, to accept a string of foolish fables beneath the intellectual level of aBushman and the moral level of a drug­fiend. All you have to do is to be yourself, to do yourwill, and to rejoice.``Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?'' He says again: ``Where I am, theseare not.'' There is much more of the same kind; enough has been quoted already to make all"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"clear. But there is a further injunction. ``Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear morejoy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art:if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein! Butexceed! exceed! Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine­­and doubt it not, an if thou artever joyous!­­death is the crown of all.''Lift yourselves up, my brothers and sisters of the earth! Put beneath your feet all fears, allqualms, all hesitancies! Lift yourselves up! Come forth, free and joyous, by night and day, todo your will; for ``There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.'' Lift yourselves up! Walk forthwith us in Light and Life and Love and Liberty, taking our pleasure as Kings and Queens inHeaven and on Earth.The sun is arisen; the spectre of the ages has been put to flight. ``The word of Sin isRestriction,'' or as it has been otherwise said on this text: That is Sin, to hold thine holy spiritin!Go on, go on in thy might; and let no man make thee afraid.Love is the law, love under will."}]
