The Key to this Message is this wordóWill. The first obvious meaning of this Law is confirmed by antithesis; ìThe Word of Sin is Restriction.î Again: ì... thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.î Take this carefully; it seems to imply a theory that if every man and every woman did his and her willóthe true Willóthere would be no clashing. ìEvery man and every woman is a starî, and each star moves in an appointed path without interference. There is plenty of room for all; it is only disorder that creates confusion. From these considerations it should be clear that ìDo what thou wiltî does not mean ìDo what you like.î It is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is also the strictest possible bond. Do what thou wiltóthen do nothing else. Let nothing deflect thee from that austere and holy task.

Every act that is not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must not be two, but one. Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained above, but also ìunassuaged of purposeî. This strange phrase must give us pause. It may mean that any purpose in the will would damp it; clearly, the ìlust of resultî is a thing from which it must be delivered. But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read ìwith purpose unassuagedîói.e. with tireless energy. The conception is, therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of staticóand this comes to the same thing in the end. The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover what his will really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this by the practices of Liber Thisharb (see Equinox I, VII, 105) or such others as may from one time to another be appointed. It should now be perfectly simple for everybody to understand the Message of the Master Therion. Thou must (1) Find out what is thy Will, (2) Do that Will with (a) one-pointedness, (b) detachment, (c) peace. Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of Things, thy will part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since the will is but the dynamic aspect of the self, and since two different selves could not possess identical wills; then, if thy will be Godís will, Thou art That. There is but one other word to explain. Elsewhere it is writtenósurely for our great comfortóìLove is the law, love under will.î This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law, the nature of that Will is Love. But this Love is as it were a by-product of that Will; it does not contradict or supersede that Will; and if apparent contradiction should arise in any crisis, it is the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE MESSAGE OF THE MASTER THERION 3Will that can guide us aright. Lo, while in the Book of the Law is much Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost like Love! Fighting most certainly is Love! ìAs brothers fight ye!î All the manly races of the world understand this. The Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile, even orgiastic. There is delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength. Mighty and terrible and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon the sacred lance of Will, the damascened inscription upon the swords of the Knight-Monks of Thelema. Love is the law, love under will. 666 "}]
