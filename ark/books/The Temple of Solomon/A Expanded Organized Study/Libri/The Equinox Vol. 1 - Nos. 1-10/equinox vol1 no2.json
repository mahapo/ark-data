There were assembled many holy men from every part of the civilised world, learned doctors, princes of the Church, bishops, abbots, deans, all the wisdom of the world; for the Question was important—how many teeth were there in a horse’s mouth. For many days the debate swung this way and that, as Father was quoted against Father, Gospel against Epistle, Psalm against Proverb; and the summer being hot, and the shade of the monastery gardens pleasant, a young monk wearied of the discussion, and rising presumptuously among those reverend men, impudently proposed that they should examine the mouth of a horse and settle the question. Now, there was no precedent for so bold a method, and we are not to be surprised that those holy men arose right wrath-fully and fell upon the youth and beat him sore. Having further immured him in a solitary cell, they resumed debate; but ultimately “in the grievous dearth of theological and historical opinion” declared the problem insoluble, an everlasting mystery of the Will of God.

However, there have been others. Whether we were too confident or they too easily discouraged is a question un-necessary to discuss. We hoped to sever at one blow their bonds; at least we should have loosened them. But their struggle, which should have aided our efforts, seemed to them too arduous. They have been perplexed rather than illumined by the light which we flashed upon them; and even if it showed a road, gave no sufficient reason why it should be followed. Of such we humbly crave the pardon; and in answer to a seemingly widespread desire to know if we mean anything, and if so, What? we request those who would know the Truth of Scientific Illuminism to look into the open mouth of its doctrine, to follow its simple teachings step by step and not to turn their backs on it and, walking in the opposite direction, declare so simple a problem to be an everlasting mystery. We are therefore not concerned with those who have not examined our doctrine of sceptical Theurgy, or scientific illuminism, or that which lies beyond. Let them examine without prejudice. Some, too, have raised weapons against us, thinking to hurt us. But malice is only the result of ignorance; let them examine us, and they will love us.

But he who stands afar off, and jests, saying: “It is not a Mountain, it is a cloud; it is not a cloud, it is a shadow; it is not a shadow, it is an illusion; it is not an illusion, it is indeed nothing at all!”—who but a fool will heed him? for not having journeyed one step, HE KNOWS NOT concerning those things of which he speaks. To make ourselves now utterly plain to all such as have misunderstood us, we will formulate our statement in many ways, so that at least there may be found one acceptable to each seeker who is open to conviction. II 1. We perceive in the sensible world, Sorrow. Ultimately that is; we admit the Existence of a Problem requiring solution. 2. We accept the proofs of Hume, Kant, Herbert Spencer, Fuller, and others of this thesis: The Ratiocinative Faculty or Reason of Man contains in its essential nature an element of self-contradiction. 3. Following on this, we say: If any resolution there be of these two problems, the Vanity of Life and the Vanity of Thought, it must be in the attainment of a Consciousness which transcends both of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 4 them. Let us call this supernormal consciousness, or, for want of a better name, “Spiritual Experience.” 4. Faith has been proposed as a remedy. But we perceive many incompatible forms of Faith founded on Authority—The Vedas, The Quran, The Bible; Buddha, Christ, Joseph Smith. To choose between the we must resort to reason, already shown to be a fallacious guide. 5. There is only one Rock which Scepticism cannot shake; the Rock of Experience. 6. We have therefore endeavoured to eliminate from the conditions of acquiring Spiritual Experience its dogmatic, theological, accidental, climatic and other inessential elements. 7. We require the employment of a strictly scientific method. The mind of the seeker must be unbiased: all prejudice and other sources of error must be perceived as such and extirpated. 8. We have therefore devised a Syncretic-Eclectic Method combining the essentials of all methods, rejecting all their trammels, to attack the Problem, through exact experiments and not by guesses. 9. For each pupil we recommend a different method (in detail) suited to his needs; just as a physician prescribes the medicine proper to each particular patient. 10. We further believe that the Consummation of Spiritual Experience is reflected into the spheres of intellect and action as Genius, so that by taking an ordinary man we can by training produce a Master. This thesis requires proof: we hope to supply such proof by producing Genius to order. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"EDITORIAL 5IIII 1. There is no hope in physical life, since death of the individual, the race, and ultimately the planet, ends all. 2. There is no hope in reason, since it contradicts itself, and is in any case no more than a reflection upon the facts of physical life. 3. What hope there may be in Investigation of the physical facts of Nature on Scientific lines is already actively sought after by a powerful and well-organized body of men of perfect probity and high capacity. 4. There is no hope in Faith, for there are many warring Faiths, all equally positive. 5. The adepts of Spiritual Experience promise us wonderful things, the Perception of Truth, and the Conquest of Sorrow, and there is enough unity in their method to make an Eclectic System possible. 6. We are determined to investigate this matter most thoroughly on Scientific lines. IIIIII 1. We are Mystics, ever eagerly seeking a solution of unpleasant facts. 2. We are Men of Science, ever eagerly acquiring pertinent facts. 3. We are Sceptics, ever eagerly examining those facts. 4.

Faith, Life, Philosophy have failed. 2. Science is already established. 3. Mysticism, being based on pure experience, is always a vital force; but owing to the lack of trained observation, has always been a mass of error. Spiritual Experience, interpreted in the terms of Intellect, is distorted; just as sunrise shows the grass green and the sea blue. Both were invisible until sunrise; yet the diversity of colour is not in the sun, but in the objects on which its light falls, and their contradiction does not prove the sun to be an illusion. 4. We shall correct Mysticism (or Illuminism) by Science, and explain Science by Illuminism. VV 1. We have one method, that of Science. 2. We have one aim, that of Religion. VIVI There was once an Inhabitant in a land called Utopia who complained to the Water Company that his water was impure."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"EDITORIAL 7 “No,” answered the Water Man, “it can't be impure, for we filter it.” “Oh indeed!” replied the Inhabitant, “but my wife died from drinking it.” “No,” said the Water Man; “I assure you that this water comes from the purest springs in Utopia; further, that water, however impure, cannot hurt anybody; further, that I have a certificate of its purity from the Water Company itself.” “The people who pay you!” sneered the Inhabitant. “For your other points, Hæckel has proved that all water is poison, and I believe you get your water from a cesspool. Why, look at it!” “And beautiful clear water it is!” said the Water Man. “Limpid as crystal. Worth a guinea a drop!” “About what you charge for it!” retorted the incensed Inhabitant. “It looks fairly clear, I admit, in the twilight. But that is not the point. A poison need not cloud water.” “But,” urged the other, “one of our directors is a prophet, and he prophesied—clearly, in so many words—that the water would be pure this year. And besides, our first founder was a holy man, who performed a special miracle to make it pure for ever!” “Your evidence is as tainted as your water,” replied the now infuriated householder. So off they went to the Judge. The Judge heard the case carefully. “My good friends!” said he, “you've neither of you got a leg to stand on; for in all you say there is not one grain of proof.—The case is dismissed.”"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 8 The Water Inspector rose jubilant, when from the body of the Court came a still small voice. “Might I respectfully suggest, your Worship, that the water in question be examined through my Microscope?” “What in thunder is a Microscope?” cried the three in chorus. “An instrument, your Worship, that I have constructed on the admitted principles of optics, to demonstrate by experience what these gentlemen are arguing about à priori and on hearsay.” Then they both rose up against him, and cursed him. “Unscientific balderdash!” said the Water Man, for the first time speaking respectfully of Science. “Blasphemous Nonsense!” said the Inhabitant, for the first time speaking respectfully of Religion. “Wait and see,” said the Judge; for he was a just Judge. Then the Man with the Microscope explained the uses of this new and strange instrument. And the Judge patiently investigated all sources of error, and concluded in the end that the instrument was a true revealer of the secrets of the water. And he pronounced just judgment. But the others were blinded by passion and self-interest. They only quarrelled more noisily, and were finally turned out of court. But the Judge caused the Man with the Microscope to be appointed Government Analyst at £12,000 a year. Now the Water Man is the Believer, and the Inhabitant the Unbeliever.

If the little girl had been able to “follow up the light,” she might there have seen Penry standing, his head and his feet white like wool, and his eyes a flaming fire! This, then, in one language or another, is our philosophical position. But for those who are not content with this, let it be said that there is something more behind and beyond. Among us are those who have experienced things of a nature so exalted that no words ever penned could even adumbrate them faintly. The communication of such knowledge, so far as it is at all possible, must be a personal thing; and we offer it with both hands. It is simple to write to the Chancellor of the A∴ A∴ at the care of the publishers, 23 Paternoster Row, E.C.; a neophyte of the Order will be detailed to meet the inquirer. He will read to him the History of the Order and explain the task of the Probationer. For we give to each inquirer a year's study; mutual, so that he may decide whether we can indeed give that which he wishes, and so that we may know exactly what training is suitable for him. Also because we are subtle of mind, many are offended. For we wished to test the world by the touchstone of THE EQUINOX. Those who perceived the essential gold that lay hidden in that hard rock are now busy delving out the same; many are thereby become rich. So I who write this for the Brethren, with all humility and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 awe, do seriously summon all men unto the Search, even those who are offended because I laugh, gazing into the Eyes of the Beloved; and those who are offended because I hate the veil of words that hides the face of the Beloved; and those who are offended because my passion for the Beloved is too virile and eager to suit their awe; perhaps they forget that passion means suffering.

This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the most minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have done in its preparation. 2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things that may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things, certain results will follow; students are earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philo-sophical validity to any of them. 3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these: (a) A widening of the horizon of the mind. (b) An improvement of the control of the mind. 4. The student, if he attain to success in the following practices, will find himself confronted by things (ideas or"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 14 beings) too glorious or too dreadful to be described. It is essential that he remain the master of all that he beholds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion, and the prey of madness. Before entering upon any of these practices, the student should be in good health, and have attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama, and Dharana. 5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fail to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, obsessed and overwhelmed by his results, even though it be by those which it is necessary that he should attain. Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well begun. It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result the importance which it at first seems to possess. 6. First, then, let us consider the Book 777 and its use; the preparation of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally the methods which follow in Chapter V. “Viator in Regnis Arboris,” and in Chapter VI. “Sagitta trans Lunam.” (In another book will it be treated of the Expansion and Contraction of Consciousness; progress by slaying the Cakkrâms; progress by slaying the Pairs of Opposites; the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, &c. &c. ) II 1. The student must FIRST obtain a thorough knowledge of Book 777, especially of columns i., ii., iii., v., vi., vii., ix., xi., xii., xiv., xv., xvi., xvii., xviii., xix., xxxiv., xxxv., xxxviii.,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"LIBER O 15 xxxix., xl., xli., xlii., xlv., liv., lv., lix., lx., lxi., lxiii., lxx., lxxv., lxxvii., lxxviii., lxxix., lxxx., lxxxi., lxxxiii., xcvii., xcviii., xcix., c., ci., cxvii., cxviii., cxxxvii., cxxxviii., cxxxix., clxxv., clxxvi., clxxvii., clxxxii. When these are committed to memory, he will begin to understand the nature of these correspondences. (See Illustrations: “The Temple of Solomon the King,” in this number. Cross-references are given.) 2. If we take an example the use of the table will become clear. Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure science. In column xlv., line 12, you will find “Knowledge of Sciences.” By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that the Planet corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its lineal figures the octagon and octagram, the God who rules that planet Thoth, or in Hebrew symbolism Tetragram-maton Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael, its Choir of Angels Beni Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit Taphtatharath, its colours Orange (for Mercury is the sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8), Yellow, Purple, Grey, and Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfumes Mastic and others, its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal or Agate, its sacred animal the Snake, &c. &c. 3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accord-ing. In an orange circle you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you would place eight lamps. The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found in Cornelius Agrippa"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 16 and other books) you would draw in the four colours with such other devices as your experiences may suggest. 4. And so on. We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary preparations; and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper books, of which the “Goetia” is perhaps the best example. These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary the student should do nothing the object of which he does not understand; also, if he have any capacity whatever, he will find his own crude rituals more effective than the highly polished ones of other people. The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows: 5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be his wish to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about him directly suggest that idea. Thus in the ritual quoted, if his glance fall upon the lights, their number suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and again Mercury is brought to his mind. In other words, the whole magical apparatus and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics. [The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular sets of images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond to particular lineal figures, divine names, &c., and are controlled by them. As to possibility of producing results external to the mind of the seer (objective, in the ordinary common-sense acceptation of the term) we are here silent.] 6. There are three important practices connected with all forms of ceremonial (and the two Methods which later we shall describe). These are:"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"LIBER O 17 (1) Assumption of God-forms. (2) Vibrations of Divine Names. (3) Rituals of “Banishing” and “Invoking.” These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous Methods of Chapters V. and VI. are attempted. III 1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt should be made thoroughly familiar. This can be done by studying them in any public museum, or in such books as may be accessible to the student. They should then be carefully painted by him, both from the model and from memory. 2. The student, seated in the “God” position, or in the characteristic attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His image as coinciding with his own body, or as enveloping it. This must be practiced until mastery of the image is attained, and an identity with it and with the God experienced. It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain tests of success in this practice exist. 3. The vibration of God-names. As a further means of identifying the human consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the name of some God, let him act thus: 4. (a) Stand with arms outstretched. (See Illustration). (b) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of the God desired entering with the breath. (c) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the solar plexus, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 18 (d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance the left foot about twelve inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn back to the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical position of the God Horus,* and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing up through the body, while you breathe it out through the nostrils with the air which has been till then retained in the lungs. All this must be done with all the force of which you are capable. (e) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger, so that you are in the characteristic position of the God Harpocrates.† 5. It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a single \"Vibration\" entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should cause him to grow hot all over, or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken him that he will find it difficult to remain standing. 6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it perceived, when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself. In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but the God-form and name should be absolutely blotted out; and the longer it takes for normal perception to return, the better. * See Illustration in Vol. I.

Not even fiction was neglected, and it was from fiction that we gathered one tiny seed-fact, which (in all these years) has germinated to the present essay. Through the ages we found this one constant story. Stripped of its local and chronological accidents, it usually came to this—the writer would tell of a young man, a seeker after the Hidden Wisdom, who, in one circumstance or another, meets an adept; who, after sundry ordeals, obtains from the said adept, for good or ill, a certain mysterious drug or potion, with the result (at least) of opening the gate of the Other-world. This potion was identified with the Elixir Vitae of the physical Alchemists, or one of their “Tinctures,” most likely the “White Tincture” which transforms the base metal (normal perception of life) to silver (poetic conception), and we sought it by fruitless attempts to poison ourselves with every drug in (and out of) the Pharmacopœia. Like Huckleberry Finn's prayer, nuffin' come of it. I must now, like the Baker, skip forty years, or rather eight, and reach a point where my travels in India had familiarised me with their systems of meditation and with the fact that many of the lesser Yogis employed hashish (whether vainly or no we shall discuss later) to obtain Samadhi, that oneness with the Universe, or with the Nothingness, which is the feeble expression by which alone we can shadow that supreme trance. I had also the advantage of falling across Ludlow's book, and was struck by the circumstance that he, obviously ignorant of Vedantist and"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 37 Yogic doctrines, yet approximately expressed them, though in a degraded and distorted form. I was also aware of the prime agony of meditation, the “dryness”* (as Molinos calls it) which hardens and sterilises the soul. The very practice which should flood it with light leads only to a darkness more terrible than death, a despair and disgust which only too often lead to abandonment, when in truth they should encourage, for that—as the oracles affirm—it is darkest before the dawn. Meditation therefore annoyed me, as tightening and constricting the soul. I began to ask myself if the “dryness” was an essential part of the process. If by some means I could shake its catafalque of Mind, might not the Infinite Divine Spirit leap unfettered to the Light? Who shall roll away the stone? Let it not be imagined that I devised these thoughts from pure sloth or weariness. But with the mystical means then at my disposal, I required a period of days or of weeks to obtain any Result, such as Samadhi in one of its greater or lesser forms; and in England the difficulties were hardly to be overcome. I found it impossible to meditate in the cold, and fires will not last equably. Gas stinks abominably; heating apparatus does not heat; electricity has hitherto not been available. When I build my temple, I shall try it. The food difficulty could be overcome by Messrs.

If only, therefore, I could reduce the necessary period to a few hours! Moreover, I could persuade other people that mysticism was not all folly without insisting on their devoting a lifetime to studying under me; and if only I could convince a few competent observers—in such a matter I distrust even myself —Science would be bound to follow and to investigate, clear up the matter once for all, and, as I believed, and believe, arm itself with a new weapon ten thousand times more potent than the balance and the microscope. Imagine me, therefore, if you please, selecting these few facts from the millions of others in the armoury of my brain, dovetailing them, and at last formulating an hypothesis verifiable by experiment. III “But I evolve all these mysteries in the profound abyss of Mind.”—ZOROASTER. This was my hypothesis: “Perhaps hashish is the drug which ‘loosens the girders of the soul,' but is in itself neither good nor bad. Perhaps, as Baudelaire thinks, it merely exaggerates and distorts the natural man and his mood of the moment.” The whole of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 39 Ludlow's wonderful introspection seemed to me to fortify this suggestion. “Well, then, let me see whether by first exalting myself mystically and continuing my invocations while the drug dissolved the matrix of the diamond soul, that diamond might not manifest limpid and sparkling, a radiance ‘not of the Sun, nor of the Moon, nor of the Stars';” and then, of course, I remembered that this ceremonial intoxication constitutes the supreme ritual of all religions. First, however, it was necessary to determine the normal action of the drug upon my particular organisation. There are various preparations of Cannabis indica, all alike in this, that their action is so uncertain as to be not easily or surely standardised. It is not even a question of reasonable limits: of two samples apparently alike one may be fifty times stronger than the other . A sample may apparently degenerate 50 per cent. in strength within a few days. Some samples may be totally inert. This fact has led to the almost total abandonment of the use of the drug in medicine. Further, the personal equation counts for much. Allan Bennett in Chancery Lane had on one occasion taken sufficient Conium (hemlock) to kill forty men without the smallest result of any kind. In Kandy I had (for the first time in my life) taken two hundred and twenty-five drops of Laudanum in five hours, also with no more result than would have been produced by ten drops upon the average man.

Let my readers be good enough to remember, then, that what follows concerns myself only. This must excuse the use of the first person, highly improper in a scientific essay, were it not that the personality of the experimenter is perhaps an essential. I cannot assert that my results would be achieved by another. Yet I have the strong conviction that I have eliminated many sources of error, and that my observations may possess a more absolute value in psychology than those of Ludlow or even of my great master Baudelaire. The few on whom I have been able to test the drug have in large measure confirmed, and in no way contradicted, my results. In the first place, I make an absolute distinction between three effects of hashish, which may be, and I think probably are—so distinct they appear—due to three separate substances. Possibly a simple stimulus-curve may account for it, but I do not think so. 1. The volatile aromatic effect (a). This, the first evanescent symptom, gives the “thrill” described by Ludlow, as of a new pulse of power pervading"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 41 one. Psychologically, the result is that one is thrown into an absolutely perfect state of introspection. One perceives one's thoughts and nothing but one's thoughts, and it is as thoughts that one perceives them. Material objects are only perceived as thoughts; in other words, in this respect, one possesses the direct consciousness of Berkeleyan idealism. The Ego and the Will are not involved; there is introspection of an almost if not quite purely impersonal type; that, and nothing more. I am not to be understood as asserting that the results of this introspection are psychologically valid. 2. The toxic hallucinative effect (b). With a sufficiently large dose—for it is possible to get effect (a) only as a transient phenomenon—the images of thought pass more rapidly through the brain, at last vertiginously fast. They are no longer recognized as thoughts, but imagined as exterior. The Will and the Ego become alarmed, and may be attacked and overwhelmed. This constitutes the main horror of the drug; it is to be combated by a highly—may I say magically?—trained will. I trust my readers will concede that the practice of ceremonial magic and meditation, all occult theories apart, do lead the mind to immense power over its own imaginations. The fear of being swept away in the tide of relentless images is a terrible experience. Woe to who yields! 3. The narcotic effect (g). One simply goes off to sleep. This is not necessarily due to the brain-fatigue induced by (a) and (b); for with one sample of Cannabis, I found it to occur independently."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 42 V “For this Paternal Intellect, which comprehendeth the Intelligibles and adorneth things ineffable, hath sowed symbols through the World.” “Comprehending that Intelligible with extended Mind; for the Intelligible is the flower of Mind.” “A similar fire flashingly extending through the rushings of air, or a Fire formless whence cometh the Image of a Voice, or even a flashing Light abounding, revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there is the vision of the fire-flashing Courser of Light, or also a Child, borne aloft on the shoulders of the Celestial Steed, fiery, or clothed with gold, or naked, or shooting with the bow shafts of Light and standing on the shoulders of the horse; then if thy meditation prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these symbols into the Form of a Lion.”—ZOROASTER. The most important of the psychological results of my experiments seem to me to lie in (a). I devoted much pains to obtaining this effect alone by taking only the minutest doses, by preparing myself physically and mentally for the experiment, and by seeking in every possible way to intensify and prolong the effect. Simple impressions in normal consciousness are resolved by hashish into a concatenation of hieroglyphs of a purely symbolic type. Just as we represent a horse by the five letters h-o-r-s-e, none of which has in itself the smallest relation to a horse, so an even simpler concept such as the letter A seems resolved into a set of pictures, a fairly large number, possibly a constant number, of them. These glyphs are perceived together, just as the skilled reader reads h-o-r-s-e as a single word, not letter by letter. These pictorial glyphs, letters as it were of the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 43 word which we call a thought, seem to stand at a definite distance in space behind the thought, the thought being farther from the perceiving soul. Looking at each glyph, one perceives, too, that itself is made up of other glyphs yet nearer to the Self, these glyphs, however, being formless and nameless; they are not truly perceived, but one is somehow aware of them. Unfortunately, the tendency to fall into effect (b) makes it very difficult to concentrate on the analysis of these ideas, so that one is hurried on to a similar examination of the next thought. It is curious, though, to notice how this analysis corresponds to the worlds of the Qabalah, the single “pure soul” at the back of all, the shadowy “creative” world, the varied “formative world,” and the single though concrete “material” world. It puzzles one, too (at the time, in the very course of the analysis), to ask: If the external simple impression be made up of so many glyphs, and each of these again of many more, how can one ever return to the “pure soul”? For all the while one is clearly conscious of a simple Ego or “pure soul” which perceives all this. The only solution appears to lie in a metaphysical identification of Monotheism and Pantheism. Again, one is conscious of a double direction in the phenomena. Not only is it true to say that the thoughts are analysed into glyphs and so on, back to the pure soul; but also that the pure soul sends forth the glyphs, which formulate the thought. Here again we must identify the Atman system of Hinduism centred in Ego with the Anatta system of Buddhism, in which the impressions are all."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 44 Further, there arises an exceedingly remarkable state of mind, described in the Bhagavad-Gita (I quote Arnold): “I, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord.” The experience could not be better phrased. Zoroaster, too: “Who first sprang from Mind, clothing the one Fire with the other Fire, binding them together, that he might mingle the fountainous craters, while preserving unsullied the brilliance of His own Fire.” “Containing all things in the one summit of his Hyparxis, He Himself subsists wholly beyond.” It is almost impossible to describe so purely metaphysical a state, which involves clearly enough a contradiction in terms. Yet the consciousness is so vivid, so intense, so certain, that logic is condemned unflinchingly as puerile. The best escape for the logician is to argue that the three assertions are closely consecutive, so closely that mind thinks them one; just as the two points of a pair of compasses pressed upon certain parts of the body are felt as one point only. While the mystic will mutter some esoteric darkness about the true interpretation of the doctrine of the Trinity. I think one should add that these results of my introspection are almost certainly due to my own training in philosophy and magic, and that nothing but the intensification of the introspective faculty is due to the hashish. Probably, too, this effect (a) would be suppressed or unnoticed in a subject who had never developed his introspection at all. Yet I am inclined to believe that this effect (a) is the true effect; and that Ludlow's “access of self-consciousness” is but the same operating on the organization of a man evidently nervous and timid. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 45 VI “The Intelligible is the principle of all section.” “The Mind of the Father whirled forth in re-echoing roar, comprehending by invincible Will Ideas omniform; which flying forth from that one fountain issued; for from the Father alike was the Will and the End (by which are they connected with the Father according to alternating life, though varying vehicles). But they were divided asunder, being by Intellectual Fire distributed into other Intellectuals. For the King of all previously placed before the polymorphous World a Type, intellectual, incorruptible, the imprint of whose form is sent forth through the World, by which the Universe shone forth decked with Ideas all-various, of which the foundation is One, One and alone. From this the others rush forth distributed and separated through the various bodies of the Universe, and are borne in swarms through its vast abysses, ever whirling forth in illimitable radiation. “They are intellectual conceptions from the Paternal Fountain partaking abundantly of the brilliance of Fire in the culmination of unresting time. “But the primary self-perfect Fountain of the Father poured forth these primogenial Ideas.” “The Soul, being a brilliant Fire, by the power of the Father remaineth immortal, and is Mistress of Life, and filleth up the many recesses of the bosom of the world.”—ZOROASTER. The alleged annihilation of time and space, which so fre-quently reappears in articles on hashish, seems to me solved more simply by a more accurate analysis of the phenomenon. The normal explanation involves the assumption that man naturally possesses a perfect and infallible “time-sense” as regular as a clock. Which is absurd; were it so, we should not need watches. We are accustomed to work (whether the idea be philosophically tenable or not is not german to the matter) with a minimum cogitabile both of space and of time.

Perhaps powerful and vivid thoughts count for a longer lapse of time than weak ones. Deep sleep passes like an invisible electric discharge. The apparently contrary fact that time seems short when we have been reading an interesting book or performing a pleasant and absorbing task is explained thus; the multitude of impressions is harmonised into one impression. Read an unharmonious and dull book, or an essay like this, and the time appears ineffably long. The other contrary fact, that a minute's Samadhi appears as an eternity, though Samadhi is a single thought, is explained by the intensity of that thought and by other considerations which I shall hope to discuss more fully in section xiii. of this essay. This, then, is what happens to the eater of hashish. For each impression he has thousands of glyphs (effect(a)) or in the more common* effect (b) the images are so multiplied and superimposed that all harmony is lost; the brain fails to keep pace with its impressions, still less to codify and control them. It finds then that from the idea “cat” to the idea “mouse” is a journey through the million dying echoes of cat to the million dawn-rays of mouse, and that the journey takes a million times as long as usual. This analysis of a thought into its dawn, noon, and sunset, is well drawn in Buddhist psychology.† Often, too, most often, one of the “cat-echoes” will be so loud that the whole chain is shattered; the cat-echo becomes * More common, judging by the reports of Ludlow and others.

The same criticism applies to space; for in practice we judge of space by the time required to pass through it, either by the small angular or focussing movements of the eye or by our general experience. So that if I cross a room, and think a million thoughts on the way, the room seems immense. It is by the tedium of the journey, not by any hallucination of the physical eye, that this illusion is produced. In writing my notes on one occasion I found that my right arm (which of course is not in the line of vision at all, normally) was many thousands of miles in extent. It was strange and difficult to control such colossal sweeps through space to the fine work of the pen. Yet my handwriting was no worse than usual—I admit this says little! It was the time that it apparently took to get one word written that caused the illusion of extravagant size, itself therefore a rational illusion, turned to phantastic absurdity by the excited imagination, which visualized it. VII “The Intelligible is the principle of all section.” “God is never so turned away from man, and never so much sendeth him new paths, as when he maketh ascent to divine speculations or works in a confused or disordered manner, and as it adds, with unhallowed lips, or unwashed feet.

Another and highly important result of thought-analysis is the criticism of thought as it arises. Just as the impres-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 48 sions are represented by pictorial glyphs, so each reflection upon an impression is accompanied by either one or two (more only when the control is imperfect) critical glyphs, as it were in small type, an annotation of approval or otherwise. Thus, a chain of thought A—B—C will have three approving pictures in a fainter key; the soul justifying the sequence. Should one continue A—B—C—E an opposing glyph will warn of the falsity, or at least cast doubt upon it. In the generally un-stable condition of the thought, such a critical glyph may be strong enough to become the dominant; and then the whole line of thought breaks down. Let me give an example: Thought Criticisms and their glyphs. 1. Man a man reaping—meaning “Good—go on.” a horse = “True—Mill's definition.” 2. Featherless Biped. Three horses in a field = “Are there no other featherless bipeds?” a stream = “Stop—Stop—Stop.” 3. Was it Mill? A tombstone on a hill = “Was it Locke?” 4. Locke? Locke? a battle. thousands of other violent glyphs. The whole mind is now a raging sea of confused thought: doubts, attempts to remember accurately who on earth first said “featherless biped” even an agony to recover thought 1, and start again. This one unfortunate weakness of thought 2 has drawn the thought-current away from the consideration of “man” to an academic question; and, as hashish goes, one is unlikely ever to get back to it. On the contrary, one of the critical glyphs attacking the thought “Locke? Locke?” will probably be strong enough to carry away the thought into a new channel, in its turn to be diverted. This at the best: for one is now ready to fall into the Maelstrom of effect (b)."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 49 There is only one remedy for this state of affairs, the discipline of thought which we call in its highest forms meditation and magic. The existence of the disease, it will be noticed, indeed perfectly explains the nature of thought-wandering as observed by me in simple meditation without drugs. It should be taken, I think, as the normal action of the untrained mind. So long as the thoughts are strongly thrown out, rational, the critical glyphs approve, and the thought-current moves harmoniously to its end. Such are the trained thought-currents of educated man. The irresponsible and aimless chatter of women and clergymen is the result of weak thoughts constantly drowned by their associated critical glyphs. Mere sympathetic glyphs, too, may be excited in really feeble intelligences. Puns and other false associations of thought are symptomatic of this imbecility. An extreme case is the classical “Cat—mousetrap—kittens” chain of the lunatic, when somebody said “hat.” As I said, there is but one remedy; we all more or less subject to this wandering of thought, and we may all wisely seek to overcome it; that remedy is to train the mind constantly by severe methods; the logic of mathematics, the concentrated observation necessary in all branches of science, the still more elaborate and austere training of magic and meditation. Too many people mistake reverie for meditation; the chemist's boy who thought Epsom salts was oxalic acid is a less dangerous person.

VIII “It is not proper to understand that Intelligible One with vehemence, but with the extended flame of far-reaching Mind, measuring all things except that Intelligible. But it is requisite to understand this; for if thou inclinest thy Mind thou wilt understand it, not earnestly; but it is becoming to bring with thee a pure and inquiring sense, to extend the void mind of thy soul to that Intelligible, that thou mayst learn the Intelligible, because it subsisteth beyond Mind.” “Thou wilt not understand it, as when understanding some common thing.”—ZOROASTER. In other of my philosophical writings I have endeavoured to show that the ratiocinative faculty was in its nature unable to solve any single problem of the universe.

But unfortunately the “common sense” of mankind retorted that after all the interior angles of every triangle are together equal to two right-angles; and that a mental process which deduced this so accurately from a few simple axioms and definitions must be trustworthy; adding something uncomplimentary about Germans and Metaphysics. Both are right, and both are wrong. In the world of common sense, reason works; in the world of philosophy, it doesn't. The metaphysical deadlock is a real and not a verbal one. The inner nature of things is not rational, at least so long as we are asked to define “rational” as “rationalistic.” Why should it be? Why should the rules of golf govern the mechanics of the flight of a golf-ball? It is this fact that has made it possible for the faith-mongers to make head against the stream of philosophy. Fichte is really and truly just as right and as wrong as Schelling; Hume is quite as impregnable as Berkeley. Let us not try to shirk the truth of it, either by the “common-sense” folly, or the “faith” folly, or the Hegelian folly. It may, I think, be readily conceded that the reasoning faculty is not apodeictally absolute. It represents a stage in human thought, no more.

The analogy is a perfect one. By meditation we obtain the vision of a new world, even as the world of microorganisms was unsuspected for centuries of thinking—thinking without method—bricks without straw! Just so, also, the masters of meditation have erred. They have attained the Mystic Vision, written long books about it, assumed that the conclusions drawn from their vision were true on other planes—as if a microscopist were to stand for Parliament on the platform “Votes for Microbes”—never noted possible sources of error, fallen foul of sense and science, dropped into oblivion and deserved contempt. I want to combine the methods, to check the old empirical mysticism by the precision of modern science. Hashish at least gives proof of a new order of conscious-ness, and (it seems to me) it is this primâ facie case that mystics have always needed to make out, and never have made out. But to-day I claim the hashish-phenomena as mental phenomena of the first importance; and I demand investigation. I assert—more or less ex cathedrâ—that meditation will revolutionise our conception of the universe, just as the microscope has done.

As a boy at school I enjoyed a reputation for unparalleled cowardice; in the world I am equally accused of foolhardiness. The judgment of the boys was the better. The truth is that I have always been excessively cautious, have never willingly undertaken even the smallest risk. The paradoxical result is that I have walked hundreds of miles unroped over snow-covered glaciers, and that nobody (so far as I know) has ever attempted to repeat my major climbs on Beachy Head. One may add a little grimly that the same remark applies to my excursions into the regions of the mind, the conscience, and the soul.

Secondly, the rule never to repeat my experiment before the lapse of at least a month."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 55 Frankly, I doubt if these were necessary. I do not sup-pose my will to be abnormally strong; I believe rather that there is a definite type of drug-slave, born from his mother's womb; and that those who achieve it or have it thrust upon them are a very small percentage. In saying this I include such obsessions as music, religion, gambling, among drugs. Is the “Keswick week” less of a debauch than the navvy's Bank Holiday? There are people who rush from meeting to meeting, and give up their whole lives to this unwholesome excess of stimulant; they are happy nowhere else; they become as irritable as the cocaine-fiend, and render wretched the lives of those who are forced to come in contact with them. Personally, I have never felt the bearing-rein of habit, though I have tried all the mental and physical poisons in turn. I smoke tobacco, the strongest tobacco, to excess, as I am told; yet a dozen times I have abandoned it, in order to see whether it had any hold upon me. It had none; I resigned it as cheerfully as a small boy resigns the tempting second half of his first cigar. After a meal (for the first day or two) my hands would go to my pockets from habit; finding nothing there, I would remember, laugh, and forget the subject at once. I think, therefore, that we may dismiss the alleged danger of acquiring the hashish habit as fantastic. Nobody will acquire the habit but the destined drug-slave; and he may just as well have the hashish habit as any other; he is sure to fall under the power of some enchantress.

The alleged sensuality of hashish—even Baudelaire admits it—simply does not exist for me, perhaps because there is no germ of lasciviousness in my mind. Of course if you excite, by whatever stimulus, a foul imagination, you will get pestilent effects. When Queen Mab tickles the lawyer, he dreams of fees. So the people who associate nudity with debauchery, and see Piccadilly Circus in Monna Lisa, will probably obtain the fullest itching from the use of the drug. I recommend it to them for, slaves and swine as they are, it must inevitably drag them to death by the road of a certifiable insanity less dangerous to society than their present subtler moral beastliness. I think, too, that Baudelaire altogether exaggerates the reaction. I never felt the slightest fatigue or lassitude; but went from the experiments to my other work with accustomed freshness and energy. Probably, however, these effects depend largely on the sample of the drug employed; some may contain more active or grosser toxic agents than others. Putting aside all these optimistic considerations, one is yet perfectly in accord with Baudelaire's conclusion, and for the same reason. (We discard his preliminary sophisms.)

But at least for the present we have not arrived so far. In my own case I should know fairly well what to do, well enough to get my little “loosening of the girders of the soul” at a guess twice in five times, perhaps more. Not surely enough to guarantee results to other people without a lengthy series of experiments, still less to recommend them to try for themselves, unless under skilled supervision. My present appeal is to recognised physiologists and psychologists to increase the number and accuracy of their researches on the introspective lines which I have laid down above, possibly with further aid from the pharmacist. Once the pure physio-psychological action is determined, I shall then ask their further attention to the special results of combining the drug with the mystic process—always invoking trained observation—and from that moment the future of Scientific Illuminism will be assured. I must add a paragraph or two on the nature of the mystic process and the general character of the transcendental states of consciousness resulting from its successful practice.

So , as I set myself to discuss the character of mystic states, it is immediately evident that if I am to render myself at all intelligible to English readers, a totally new system of classification must be thought out. The classical Eight Jhanas will be useless to us; the Hindu system is almost as bad; the Qabalistic requires a preliminary knowledge of the Tree of Life whose explanation would require a volume to itself; but fortunately we have, in the Buddhist Skandhas and the Three Characteristics which deny them, a scheme easily assimilable to Western psychology. In “Science and Buddhism” I dealt in some detail with these Skandhas; but I will briefly recapitulate. In examining any phenomenon and analysing it we first notice its Name and Form (Nama and Rupa). “Here is a Rose,” we say. In such a world live the entirely vulgar. Next (with Berkeley) we perceive that this statement is false. There is an optical sensation (Vedana) of red; an olfactory sensation of fragrance; and so on. Even its weight, its space, are modifications of sense; and the whole statement is transformed into “Here is a pleasurable set of sensations which we group under the name of a rose.” In such a world lives the sensuous artist. Next, these modifications of sense are found to be but percepts; the pleasure or pain vanishes; and the sensations are observed coldly and clearly without allowing the mind to be affected. This perception (Sañña) is the world of the surgeon or the man of science. Next, the perception itself is seen to be dependent on the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 59 nature of the observer, and his tendency (Sankhara) to perceive. The oyster gets no fun out of the rose. This state establishes a dualistic conception, such as Mansel was unable to transcend, and at the same time places the original rose in its cosmic place. The creative forces that have made the rose and the observer what they are, and established their relation to one another, are now the sole consciousness. Here lives the philosopher. Easily enough, this state passes into one of pure consciousness (Viññanam). The rose and the observer and their tendencies and relations have somehow vanished. The phenomenon (not the original phenomenon, “a rose,” but the phenomenon of the tendency to perceive the sensation of a rose) becomes a cloudless light; a static, no longer a dynamic conception. One has somehow got behind the veil of the universe. Here live the mystic and the true artist. The Buddhist, however, does not stop here, for he alleges that even this consciousness is false; that like all things it has the Three Characteristics of Sorrow, Change, and Unsubstantiality. Now all this analysis is a purely intellectual one, though perhaps it may be admitted that few philosophers have been capable of so profound and acute a resolution of phenomena. It has nothing to do with mysticism as such, but its rational truth makes it a suitable basis for our proposed classification of the mystic states which result from the many religious and magical methods in use among men.

Imagine as strongly as possible your own figure standing in front of you. Transfer your consciousness to that figure, so that you look down upon your physical body in the chair.

Probably the eyes of your “astral” body will be closed. It is sometimes difficult to open them. You will then perceive all sorts of forms, varying as you travel about. Their nature will depend almost entirely on your power of control. Some people may even perceive the phantoms of delirium and madness, and truly go mad from fear and horror.

These forms are more solid and real, much more dange-rous, and are excessively difficult to obtain. I have known very few successful practitioners. All these forms and names are almost infinitely varied. The grosser visual and auditory phenomena of hashish belong to the group. It is not just to suppose that a vision of a Divine being of ineffable splendour is necessarily of higher type than this shadowy form-world. Mistake on this point has led many a student astray. Highest among these things are the three visual and seven auditory phenomena of Yoga. (We omit consideration of the other senses; the subject requires a volume.) These are referred to the Sun, the Moon, and Fire; and their appearance marks the attainment of Dhyana. They are dazzling, and accompanied with such intense though passionless bliss that they partake of the nature of Vedana and may under certain conditions even rise to touch Sañña. Of the auditory are sounds heard like bells, elephants, thunder, trumpets, sea-shells, “the sweet-souled Vina,” and so on; they are of less importance and are much more common. As one would expect, such forms leave little impress upon the memory. Yet they are seductive enough, and I am afraid that the very great majority of mystics live all their lives wandering about in this vain world of shadows and of shells.

It may be useful here to distinguish once and for all between false and real mystical phenomena; for in the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 65 previous section we have spoken of both without distinction. In the “astral visions” the consciousness is hardly disturbed; in magical evocations it is intensely exalted; but it is still bound by its original conditions. The Ego is still opposed to the non-Ego; time is, if altered in rate, still there; so, too, is Space the sort of Space we are all conscious of. Again, the phenomena observed follow the usual laws of growth and decay. But all true mystical phenomena contradict these conditions. In the first place, the Ego and non-Ego unite explosively, their product having none of the qualities of either. It is precisely such a phenomenon as the direct combination of Hydrogen and Chlorine. The first thing observed is the flash; in our analogy, the ecstasy of Ananda (bliss) attending the Dhyana. And as this flash does not aid us to analyse the Hydrochloric acid gas, so the Ananda prevents us by startling us from perceiving the true nature of the phenomenon. In higher mystic states, then, we find that the Yogi or Magician has learnt how to suppress it. But the combination of the elements will usually be a definite single act of catastrophic energy. This act, too, does not take place in time or space as we know them. I think that for the first time of experiencing a Dhyana it is necessarily single. Certain mystical methods may teach us to retain the image; but the criterion of true Dhyana is the singleness, so totally opposed as it is to the vague and varying phantoms of the “astral plane.” The new consciousness resulting from the combination is, too, always a simple one. Even where it is infinitely complex, as in Atmadarshana or the Vision of the Universal"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 66 Peacock, its oneness is the truer of these two contradictory truths. So for the matter of time and space. All time is filled; all space is filled; the phenomenon is infinite and eternal. This is true even though its singleness makes the duration of the phenomenon but one minimum cogitabile. In short, it is experienced in some other kind of time, some other kind of space. There is nothing irrational about this. Non-Euclidean geometries, for example, are possible, and may be true. It is only necessary to a theory of the universe that it should be true to itself within itself; for there is no other thing outside by which we can check our calculations. Nor is it inconceivable that many of these worlds may exist, interpenetrating. Assume four dimensions, and there is room for an infinite number of them. For though a plane fills a square completely, it must always leave a cube entirely empty. Concerning the laws which govern this new realm we can say nothing here. The most mystics have been led away from the proper line of research, usually by the baser (i.e., the emotional or devotional) attractions of the Vedana-phenomena which we are about to notice; but perhaps even the best must be baffled by the non-congruity of their Experience with the symbols of language. One may add that the language difficulty is in some ways an essential one. Language begins with simple expression of the common needs of the most animal life. Hence we see that all sciences have formulated a technical language of their own, not to be understanded of the common people. The"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 67 reproach against mystics that their symbols are obscure is just as well founded as a similar reproach against the algebraist or the chemist.

What is gained to “popular science” is lost to exactitude; and in a paper of this sort I fear rather the reproach of my mystical masers than that of the bewildered crowd. More important and certain than the mere characteristics of mystic traces in themselves is the great and vital diagnostic that the result of a true trance is to inspire the Yogi with power to do first- rate work in his own department. People who produce maudlin and hysterical gush, inane sentimentality, who are faddists, fools, drivellers, dodderers—these I refuse to accept as mystics. The true phenomena of mysticism can only occur in a high-class brain and a healthy brain; and their action on that brain is to repose it, to fortify it, to make it more capable of lofty and continuous thought. Beware of the sheep in lions' skins, the asses that bray and think “the tiger roars!” Physically too the mystic is to be known by his atmo-sphere of power, cleanliness and light; by his self-control, his concentration of thought and action, his vigour, his patience. You will rarely find them at afternoon tea gossiping about clairvoyance, or even “playing Adam.” What? you don't know how to play “Adam”? And you call yourself a sage? Tut!

If the Bible turns in a dextro-rotary manner the answer is “yes”; if in the opposite direction, “no.” This sublime method of tearing out the heart of destiny is evidently derived from a slightly more elaborate one in the “Key of Solomon” (Book I., chap. ix.) for detecting theft, which is done with a sieve, and which I supposed (until “Adam” advised me to the contrary) to represent the lowest debauchery in which the human intellect could wallow.

Vedana.—Pertaining to Sensation we may first notice in the beginner's concentrating mind the class of distracting thoughts which refer to the emotions. The taking of pleasure in, or the endurance of pain from, the meditation itself is in particular to be dreaded. Of mystic phenomena we may notice the immense class of devotional apparitions. Vishnu, Christ, Jehovah and other deities appear in response to long-continued and passionate love. See “Bhagavad Gita,” chap. xi., the visions of many Catholic saints, Teresa, Gertrude, Francis and others, Anna Kingsford (“Clothed with the Sun,” Part III.), Idra Rabba Qadisha and so on.

These phenomena are nearly always tainted with sexuality, and are excessively dangerous from this cause. “Dirt is matter in the wrong place,” and to mix, consciously or unconsciously, either morality or immorality with religion is dirty; and dirt makes disease. The victim becomes a fanatic at the best, at the worst and most frequent a driveller. Of a lower type are the loves of Magi and invoked elementals. As Levi says, “the love of the Magus for such beings is insensate, and may destroy him.” It surely will, if he beware not in time. Higher again because more purely formless and for this reason truer to the Vedana type are the ecstasies of joy and agony experienced by such men as Luther, Fox, Molinos, and others. Professor William James treats most adequately of this matter in his “Varieties of Religious Experience.” The limitations of this stage are first, its absorption in self; secondly, its almost always insuperable tendency to self-limitation and narrowness. Two mystics, the one wallowing in Jesus and the other in Vishnu, will describe their experiences in almost identical language, yet denounce each other as “heathen” and “Mlechha” respectively. Among hashish phenomena the correspondences are those of the intense emotions experienced (well described"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 71 by de Quincey (opium) and Ludlow in particular). Such are fear, pride, love, laughter, anguish, and the rest. In the case of Vishvarupadarshana (the vision of Vishnu) and even of such results as those of St. Francis and St. Ignatius, the best mystics may steer clear of the selfishness, narrowness, and emotionalism, and raise their experience to the type of Sañña or even of Sankhara. The “Bhagavad Gita” certainly reaches the latter height —or at least a reflection from that height—at one or two points. We must not omit to attribute to this section the lower aspect of what Abramelin the Mage calls the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, another (and less metaphysically pretentious) way of speaking of the “Higher Self” or “Genius.” It is indeed but a low aspect, for in truth the phenomenon pertains to Viññanam. Yet in simpler souls this peculiar Grace condescends—may one say?—to this level, just as a father may join in the games of his child, thus gaining its sympathy and confidence as a basis for a higher union.

Harder to destroy are they than the others, since they come no longer from memory or physical conditions, but from the practice itself, so that they cannot be shut off, but must needs be faced and conquered directly. In the mystic world, we come to those strange metaphysical ecstasies which (I am convinced) lie behind many philosophical dogmas. St. Athanasius had probably experienced something of this type when he penned his insane creed. So the Hindus with their attempts to affirm Parabrahma by denying him all qualities, their dogmas of the “pairs of opposites,” their assertion of Sat-Chit-Ananda as transcending these pairs; so too perhaps with Herbert Spencer it was direct Samadhic perception of this Sañña type that led him to formulate his irrational doctrine of Transcendental Realism, just as (certainly) Berkeley's doctrine arose from Samadhi of the type of Vedana. For the stigma of this class of mystic experience is undoubtedly first its resolution of all concepts into purely formless and passionless perception, secondly (and above this), its transcendence of the laws of thought, as we have been accustomed to understand them. (This is only in part true. Keynes' “Formal Logic,” profoundly studied, leads one perilously close to the suprarational. The eminent professor is perhaps hardly aware of how his eagle-flights have brushed the sun with their fiery wings.)

In the case of the god Osiris, for example, he will no longer express his vision by the name Osiris or by the green face, by the white robes starred with the three active colours, by the crown and by the crook and scourge; nor will he chant wondrous hymns of the descent into Amennti, the death and resurrection of the God; but he will express all this by some pure symbol, such as the cross, the hexagram, or even the number 6. And those upon his plane will understand him. Here, too, we must class the revelations of the pure Qabalah, and the discovery of the relations between symbols. So exalted in truth are the states upon this Sañña grade that the rational man will almost always fail to understand them. Of the Rupa visions he has some experience, if only in analogy; he calls the mystic of Rupa a silly fool; so too of Vedana, whose mystic he calls a besotted ass; but the mystic of Sañña appears to him as a raving lunatic. The hashish correspondences of this stage are the mental analyses which I have gone into so fully above, sections v. and vii. The methods for obtain success in this matter are far more formidable than those previously sufficient. The whole mind must be intended for long unbroken periods, concen-trated absolutely upon its own working until this becomes normal to it, when the state called Pratyahara is attained. The first result will be its resolution into disconnected impressions.

This agony, belonging to the lower stage of Vedana, is the drag, ever pulling back the mystic as he endeavours to break down the blackness of his insanity. Yet the unity of its anguish is the proof of its Selfhood, and the earnest of its resurrection from the abyss. Such a mystic state may last through several days, perhaps through weeks. I should not care to assert limitations. The slightest error in the process would almost certainly result in permanent and hopeless melancholia; suicide might be the most fortunate termination.

Sankhara.—The reader will notice—I trust with pained sympathy—the increasing difficulty of expressing these results of meditation in language. At this point one almost desires to exclaim with Fichte that if it were only possible to start all over again, one would begin by inventing a totally new scheme of symbolism. Here in Sankhara, hashish-analogy is somewhat at fault. Possibly the conviction of the irresistibility of the connection of cause and effect, the consciousness of the necessity of subject and object to each other through immutable glyphs may represent it. It may be that my experience of hashish is even more imperfect than I have supposed, and that more gifted experimenters might fill this gap."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HASHISH 75 In the beginner's concentration—though he is hardly to be called a beginner at this stage—Sankhara presents a terrible obstacle. For the distraction to his even flow of thought is that very flow itself; not as in Sañña, the accidents necessarily arising from that flow, as it were the rocks in the bed of the stream, but the law of gravitation itself, its necessary tendency to follow its own course. So that the good young Yogi finds himself thus awkwardly placed; that having created a mighty engine and removed all conceivable impediments to its smooth working, he is now confronted by the inertia of all that majesty and might. Frankenstein! The mystic states of Sankhara are more awful and tremendous than any we have yet noticed. Atmadarshana, for instance, is only to be described feebly (yet I fear unintelligibly, even so) by speaking of a consciousness of the entire Universe as One, and as All, in Its necessary relation to Itself in and out of Time and Space. Here, too, is the result of Sammasati, a comprehension of one's own self and its relation to, and identity with, everything. . . . But I feel that I am drivelling. The effort to think of these things, to translate them into the language of philosophy, gives the feeling—I grope and find no other expression—that one's head is going to blow off. One feels inclined to get up and shout for very feebleness, and only the utter fatuity of that or any other method of obtaining relief keeps one quietly writing.

Except, of course, that by this time one has abandoned meals for ever! The memory acquires the habit, and eventually goes on working backwards through sleep, back, back, through birth and previous states until (saith Bhikhu Ananda Metteyya) going ever back through the past one comes right round to the future—“Which is pretty, but I don't know what it means!” I think it right to mention that I never obtained any sort of success in this meditation, and only give it on hearsay. The real key to the stage is Sammasati—Right Recollec-tion. One considers all known factors which have gone to make one up such as one is, oneself and not another. Clearly the omission of a single minute item must alter the whole course of events. Consider then, why thus, and not thus. “Explore the River of the Soul, whence, or in what order you have come: so that although you have become a servant to the body, you may again rise to the Order from which you descended, joining works to sacred reason.” Why was I born in England, not in Wales? Why were my parents just who they were and not others?

It must, for the Universe is not insane—that blackness has been passed. Who then am I? And why? And why? Reaching ecstasy or Samadhi through this channel, the riddle of Kamma is answered, and one is able to enter the realm of pure consciousness. The Universe, mastered long ere now in its effects, is at last mastered in its causes; and it is indeed a Magister of the Temple who can say: Vi Veri Vniversum Vivvs Vici. XVII \"All things subsist together in the Intelligible World.\" ZOROASTER. I must insert a short note on the word Samadhi, source of infinite misunderstanding. Etymologically it is composed of Sam (Greek sun), together with, and Adhi (Heb. Adonai), the Lord, especially the Personal Lord, or Holy Guardian Angel. The Hindus accordingly use it to name that state of mind in which subject and object, becoming One, have disappeared. Just as H combines with Cl, and HCl results, so the Yogi combines with the object of his meditation (perhaps his own heart) and these disappearing, Vishnu appears. It is not that the Yogi perceives Vishnu.* The Yogi is gone, just as the * The difficulty of showing this makes the author of the “Bhagavad Gita” descend to Rupa-symbols when he ought to have been in Viññanam (chap. xi.).

There is the tube, and it is full of HCl out of all relation to its elements, through the result of their union. (I purposely take the “elementary chemistry” view of the matter.) Samadhi is therefore with the Hindu a result, the result of results indeed. There are higher and lower forms. That called Nirvikalpa-Samadhi, when the trance results from banishing thought altogether, instead of concentrating on one thought, is the highest kind. But, with the Buddhist, Samadhi, though the state of mind meant is the same, is not an end, but a means. The holy-man-of-the-East must keep this state of mind unimpaired during his whole life, using it as a weapon to attack the Three Characteristics (the antithesis of Nibbana) even as one uses one's normal dualistic consciousness to attack that dualism. But I must observe that this idea is so tremendous that I almost doubt its possibility, and tremble as to my own under-standing of it. Samadhi twelve seconds in duration is a phenomenon to shake the soul of a man, to uproot his Kamma, to destroy his Identity—and Bhikku Ananda Metteyya cheer-fully talks of practically perpetual Samadhi as the first step to attainment! The Hindu, too, asks this question. biography of a Mystic would run: foetus, babe, child, boy, youth, man, 418.

The Hindu probably mutters something about criticism of Nibbana having forced some Buddhists to a conception of Parinibbana, simply but neatly defined as That to which none of the criticisms apply! Yet Atman and Nibbana are defined in almost identical terms. It is clearly idle for us who know neither perfectly to attempt to arbitrate in so delicate an imbroglio.

In the case of the aspirant to meditation, this stage is even more terrible than the last. He has, to use our previous figures, suspended the law of gravitation; the stream is still, and the Sun of the soul is faithfully reflected in its brilliance; the mighty engine is stopped. But—there it is! We have got rid of motion, but matter remains. (Again must I apologise for taking so elementary a view of physics.) And while there is a particle of matter, it must fill the Universe—there is no place for spirit. His thought is controlled and smooth; his thought (even!) is stopped: but there the thought is.

Yet the negation of this phrase is only apparent; the sense is that all that negative Atmadarshana is destroyed; it is only an illusion that goes.

If I persist, seeing that my little gift of language must be mine for some purpose, and therefore for this purpose, since no other purpose can there be, let my rationalist friends excuse me, as the agony of my impotence most terribly avenges them. Concerning the methods of obtaining these particular states, I am almost at one with Sri Parananda, my godly friend, when he talks of “the Grace of the Lord Shiva,” and with my ungodly friend Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya, when he hints that the accidental coincidence of the circumferences of the Nibbana-Dhatu and the Samsara-Chakra with the Brahmarandra of the sphere of the 99-year-old-Talipot-palm-like sucking Arahat may have something to do with it. Plainly, we know so very little; so few ever attain this class of experience that one is perhaps hardly justified in maintaining (as I always have maintained and that stoutly) that the reward is according to the work. It may conceivably be that work does not affect the question, as it clearly does in the lower grades, it may be that an outsider may pull off the big thing—Agnosco!

It may, I believe, happen with fair frequency that in the course of any advanced meditation or invocation this particular type of spiritual experience may suddenly arise without apparent cause. Anyway, let us hope so! As a matter of practical politics, I think that a judicious mixture of the methods of East and West is likely to give the best results. Let the young Adept, for example, master thoroughly the groundwork of the Hindu system. Let him master Asana, posture, so that he can sit motionless for hours without any message from his body reaching and so disturbing his brain. Let him include in his accomplishments Pranayama, control of the breath and of the vital nervous currents which react in sympathy with it. Let him then exalt to the utmost his soul by the appropriate ritual of ceremonial magic; and when by this means he has most thoroughly identified himself with the Supreme, let him, as that Supreme One, continue to meditate with intense force upon Himself, until his sphere is entirely filled with the single Thought. Lastly, if this, the male energy, suffice not, let him transform it into a pure and perfect emptiness and passivity, as of one waiting for the Beloved One, with intense longing rendered passionless by the certainty that He will come."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 84 Then, it may be, the Eye will open upon him, and the tomb of his Pyramid be unsealed. It is impossible in a few words to explain thoroughly this eclectic system; for each act and thought of the ritual demands an expert teacher, and even a good pupil might study for years before mastering the method. By which time he might not impossibly have discovered one of his own. Howbeit, I must do my best; and if by that best I can help “the least of these little ones,” so much the better.

And that is where the joke comes in. Yet to the adept the Anglo-Indian proverb, “A jok's a jok (leech) but a jok up your nose is no joke” (Nose is not the word; but no matter!), may occur with painful intensity. For he is no nearer to Nibbana than when he started. Though he has stripped off all the husks of thought and touched Thought itself, even attaining to Negation of thought; yet he is still upon the plane of Thought. And—that which can be thought is not true.

For the Three Characteristics are true of Viññanam as they are of Rupa; Change, Sorrow, Unsubstantiality. He has only one asset; the habit of One-pointedness—Ekâgrata. He may be all kinds of a black magician; but at least he has learnt to concentrate his mind. But what is he to aim at? Hashish-analogy is better than ever here; for Nibbana stands to the attainment of the Eight Jhanas, the Four Formless States k.t.l. as the Decalogue does to any of his hashish-states. It has nothing whatever to do with it. All this time he has been walking round the circumference of a wheel, cheerfully singing “Nearer, my God, to Thee; Nearer to Thee!” while his God is in the centre. He has done the medicine-man trick, and wasted a lot of maidens in the hope of making rain. So—one must suppose, for here I reach a point where, as Mr. Waite jeers, we are driven to take refuge in portentous darkness and irretrievable mystery (because we don't know anything about it)—he sits down and contemplates the Three Characteristics. This will presumably be very difficult to do because he is probably (for all the “Grace of the Lord Shiva” business) an expert in the Viññanam trances, and having thus created an eternal Universe and an even more eternal Absence of Universe, both of which, too, are probably mere masses of Sat—Chit—Ananda (Being—Knowledge—Bliss) while he is trying to think of Change—Sorrow—Unsubstantiality.

Edited by ALAN LEO. Monthly, 6d. 42 Imperial Buildings, Ludgate Circus, E.C. Foremost in the attempt to rehabilitate astrology on modern lines is this well-known monthly magazine. The method indicated is the sound one of accurate observation and deduction; but whether the ultimate proposition of astrology can be established is a question which your reviewer at present is disinclined to assert. It is quite easy to throw ridicule, or to demolish by inexorable logic; but such methods do not convince. At least we believe that any person with a little experience can tell almost at a glance the sign rising at a stranger's birth, and that so frequently and certainly as to put chance and coincidence out of the question. For our own part, we consider Astrology a valuable aid to concentration, and perhaps the best of the methods of determining the Sankhara-skanda of a man. In your reviewer's own exper-ience she has found it more reliable than either Geomancy or the Tarot, in questions genethliacal, at least. A careful study of the characteristics of the signs and planets is, moreover, of the very greatest assistance in the use of the Book 777. Unable as the Editor is to find space within the restricted pages of THE EQUINOX for astrological matters, we are glad to think that the subject has a specialised organ in competent hands.

This long and learned work is not exciting: The good translation shames the pedant's writing. The wise Professor reconstructs duality, Made of mentality and animality. His arguments are forcible and true, But yet his propositions will not do; For when the full circumference is run We can resolve them gaily into one. Nay, though he talk of monism, we feel He does not mean it. Mind and reason reel At this conception. Only in the soul Can we perceive the One Unchanging Whole.

Roderic Mason came striding up the steepness of the Rue St. Vincent, his pipe gripped hard in his jaw; for the hill is too abrupt for lounging. On the terrace he stretched himself, twirled round half a dozen times like a dervish, pocketed his pipe, and went stooping through the open doorway. Grand old Frédéric was there, in his vast corduroys and sou'-wester hat, a 'cello in his hand. His trim grey beard was a shade whiter than when Roderic had last patronised the “Lapin,” five years before; but the kindly, gay, triumphant eyes were nowise dimmed by time. He knew Roderic at a glance, and give his left hand carelessly, as if he had been gone but yesterday. Time ambles easily for the owner of such an eyrie, his life content with wine and song and simple happiness."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 108 It is in such as Frédéric that the hope of the world lies. You could not bribe Frédéric with a motor-car to grind in an office and help to strive and enslave his fellows. The bloated, short-of-breath, bedizened magnates of commerce and finance are not life, but a disease. The monster hotel is not hospitality, but imprisonment. Civilisation is a madness; and while there are men like Frédéric there is a hope that it will pass. Woe to the earth when Bumble and Rockefeller and their victims are the sole economic types of man! Roderic sat down on his favourite bench against the wall, and took stock of things. How well he remembered the immense Christ at the end of the room, a figure conceived by a giant of old time, one might have thought, and now covered with a dry, green lichenous rot, so that the limbs were swollen and distorted. It gave an incredibly strong impression of loathsome disease, entirely overpowering the intention of picturing inflicted pain. Roderic, who, far from being a good man, was actually a Freethinker, thought it a grimly apt symbol of the religion of our day. On His right stood a plaster Muse, with a lyre, the effect being decidedly improved by some one who had affixed a comic mask with a grinning mouth and a long pink nose; on His left a stone plaque of Lakshmi, the Hindu Venus, a really very fine piece of work, clean and dignified, in a way the one sanity in the room, except an exquisite pencil sketch of a child, done with all the delicacy and strength of Whistler. The rest of the decoration was a delicious mixture of the grotesque and the obscene. Sketches, pastels, cuts, cartoons, oils, all the media of art, had been exhausted in a"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 109 noble attempt to flagellate impurity—impurity of thought, line, colour, all we symbolise by womanhood. Hence the grotesque obscenity in nowise suggested Jewry; but gave a wholesome reaction of life and youth against artificiality and money-lust. As it chanced, there was nobody of importance in the “Lapin.” Frédéric, with his hearty voice and his virile roll, more of a dance than a walk, easily dominated the company. Yet there was at least one really remarkable figure in the pleasant gloom of the little cabaret. A man sat there, timid, pathetic, one would say a man often rebuffed. He was nigh seventy years of age, maybe; he looked older. For him time had not moved at all, apparently; for he wore the dress of a beau of the Second Empire. Exquisitely, too, he wore it. Sitting back in his dark corner, the figure would have gained had it been suddenly transplanted to the glare of a State ball and the steps of a throne. Merrily Frédéric trolled out an easy, simple song with perfect art—how different from the laborious inefficiency of the Opera!—and came over to Roderic to see that his coffee was to his liking. “Changes, Frédéric!” he said, a little sadly. “Where is Madeleine la Vache?” “At Lourcine.” “Mimi l'Engeuleuse?” “At Clamart.” “The Scotch Count, who always spoke like a hanging judge?”"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 110 “Went to Scotland—he could get no more whisky here on credit.” “His wife?” “Poor girl! poor girl!” “Ah! it was bound to happen. And Bubu Tire- Cravat?” Frédéric brought the edge of his hand down smartly on the table, with a laugh. “He had made so many widows, it was only fair he should marry one!” commented the Englishman. “And Pea-shooter Charley?” “Don't know. I think he is in prison in England.” “Well, well; it saddens. ‘Where are the snows of yesteryear?’ I must have an absinthe; I feel old.” “You are half my years,” answered Frédéric. “But come! If yesteryear be past, it is this year now. And all these distinguished persons who are gone, together are not worth one silver shoe-buckle of yonder——” Frédéric nodded towards the old beau. “True, I never knew him; yet he looks as if he had sat there since Sedan. Who is he?” “We do not know his name, monsieur,” said Frédéric softly, a little awed; “but I think he was a duke, a prince—I cannot say what. He is more than that—he is unique. He is—le Revenant de la Rue des Quatre Vents!” “The Ghost of the Street of the Four Winds?” Roderic was immensely taken by the title; a thousand fantastic bases for the sobriquet jumped into his brain. Was the Rue des Quatre Vents haunted by a ghost in his image? There are no ghosts in practical Paris. But of all the ideas"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 111 which came to him, not one was half so strange as the simple and natural story which he was later to hear. “Come,” said Frédéric, “I will present you to him.” “Monseigneur,” he said, as Roderic stood before him, ready to make his little bow, “let me present Monsieur Mason, an Englishman.” The old fellow took little notice. Said Frédéric in his ear: “Monsieur lives on the boulevard St. Germain, and loves to paint the streets.” The old man rose with alacrity, smiled, bowed, was en-chanted to meet one of the gallant allies whose courage had— he spoke glibly of the Alma, Inkerman, Sebastopol. The little comedy had not been lost on Roderic. Wondering, he sat down beside the old nobleman. What spell had Frédéric wrought of so potent a complexion? “Sir,” he said, “the gallantry of the French troops at the Malakoff was beyond all praise; it will live for ever in history.” To another he might have spoken of the entente cordiale; to this man he dared not. Had not his brain perhaps stopped in the sixties? Had the catastrophe of '70 broken his heart? Roderic must walk warily. But the conversation did not take the expected turn. The old gentleman elegantly, wittily, almost gaily, chattered of art, of music, of the changed appearance of Paris. Here, at any rate, he was au courant des affaires. Yet as Roderic, puzzled and pleased, finished his absinthe he said more seriously than he had yet spoken: “I hear that monsieur is a great painter” (Roderic modestly waved aside"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 112 the adjective), “has painted many pictures of Paris. Indeed, as I think of it, I seem to remember a large picture of St. Suplice at the Salon of eight years ago—no, seven years ago.” Roderic stared in surprise. How should any one—such a man, of all men—remember his daub, a thing himself had long forgotten? The oldster read his thought. “There was one corner of that picture which interested me deeply, deeply,” he said. “I called to see you; you had gone—none knew here. I am indeed glad to have met you at last. Perhaps you would be good enough to show me your pictures—you have other pictures of Paris? I am interested in Paris—in Paris itself --- in the stones and bricks of it. Might I—if you have nothing better to do—come to your studio now, and see them?” “I'm afraid the light—” began Roderic. It was now ten o'clock. “That is nothing,” returned the other. “I have my own criteria of excellence. A match-glimmer serves me.” There was only one explanation of all this. The man must be an architect, perhaps ruined in the mad speculations of the Empire, so well described by Zola in “La Curée.” “At your service, sir,” he said, and rose. The old fellow was surely eccentric; but equally he was not dangerous. He was rich, or he would not be wearing a diamond worth every penny of two thousand pounds, as Roderic, no bad judge, made out. There might be profit, and there would assuredly be pleasure. They waved, the one an airy, the other a courteous, good-night to grand old Frédéric, and went out. The old man was nimble as a kitten; he had all the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 113 suppleness of youth; and together they ran rapidly down to the boulevard, where, hailing a fiacre, they jumped in and clattered down towards the Seine. Roderic sat well back in the carriage, a little lost in thought. But the old man sat upright, and peered eagerly about him. Once he stopped the cab suddenly at a house with a low railing in front of it, well set back from the street, jumped out, examined it minutely, and then, with a sigh and a shake of the head, came back, a little wearier, a little older. They crossed the Seine, rattled up the Rue Bonaparte, and stopped at the door of Roderic's studio. IIII LA RUE DES QUATRE VENTS “Ah, well,” said the old man, as he concluded his examina-tion of the pictures, “what I seek is not here. If it will not weary you, I will tell you a story. Perhaps, although you have not painted it, you have seen it. Perhaps—bah! I am seventy years of age, and a fool to the end. “Listen, my young friend! I was not always seventy years of age, and that of which I have to tell you happened when I was twenty-two. “In those days I was very rich, and very happy. I had never loved; I cared for nobody. My parents were both dead long since. A year of freedom from the control of my good old guardian, the Duc de Castelnaudry (God rest his soul!), had left me yet taintless as a flower. I had that chivalrous devotion to woman which perhaps never really existed at any time save for rare individuals."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 114 “Such a one is ripe for adventure, and since, as your great poet has said, ‘Circumstance bows before those who never miss a chance,' it was perhaps only a matter of time before I met with one. “Indeed (I will tell you, for it will help you to understand my story), I once found myself in an extremely absurd position through my fantastic trust in the impeccability of woman. “It was rather late one night, and I was walking home through a deserted street, when two brutal-looking ruffians came towards me, between them a young and beautiful girl, her face flushed with shame, and screaming with pain; for the savages had each firm hold of one arm, and were forcing her at a rapid pace—to what vile den? “My fist in the face of one and my foot in the stomach of the other! They sprawled in the road, and, disdaining them, I turned my back and offered my arm to the girl. She, in an excess of gratitude, flung her arms round my neck and began to kiss me furiously—the first kiss I had ever had from a woman, mind you! Maybe I would not have been altogether displeased, but that she stank so foully of brandy that—my gorge rises at the memory. The ruffians, more surprised than hurt, began laughing, but kept well away. I tried to induce the girl to come home; in the end she lost her temper, and fell to belabouring me with her fists. I was not strong enough or experienced enough to contend with a madwoman, and I could not allow myself to strike her. She beat me sore. . . . “I can remember the scene now as if it were yesterday: the bewildered boy, the screaming, swearing, kicking, scratch-ing woman, the two 'savages' (honest bourgeois enough!)"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 115 reeling against the houses, crying with laughter, too weak with laughter to stand straight. “By-and-by they took pity, came forward, and released me from my unpleasant situation. “But the shame of me, as I slunk away down the streets! I would not go home that night at all, ashamed to face my own servants. “I told myself, in the end, that this was a rare accident; but for all that there must have remained a slight stain upon the mirror of perfect chivalry. In the old days when they taught logic in the schools one learnt how delicate a flower was a ‘universal affirmative.' “It was some uneventful months after this ‘tragedy of the ideal' that I was again walking home very late. I had been to the Jardin des Plantes in the afternoon, and, dining in that quarter, had stayed lingering on the bridge watching the Seine. The moon dropped down behind the houses—with a start I realised that I must go home. There was some danger, you understand, of footpads. Nothing, however, occurred until—I always preferred to walk through the narrow streets; there is romance in narrow streets!—I found myself in the Rue des Quatre Vents; not a stone's-throw from this house, as you know. “I had been thinking of my previous misadventure, and, with the folly of youth, had been indulging in a reverie of the kind that begins ‘If only.' If only she had been a princess ravished by a wicked ogre. If only . . . If only . . . “On the south side of the Rue des Quatre Vents is a house standing well back from the street, with a railing in front of it—a common type, is it not? But what riveted my"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 116 attention upon it was that while the front of the house was otherwise entirely dark, from a window on the first floor streamed a blaze of light. The window was wide open to the street; voices came from it. “The first an old, harsh, menacing voice, with all the sting of hate in it; nay, the sting of something devilish, worse than hate. A corrupt enjoyment of its malice informed it. And the words it spoke were too infamous for me to repeat. They are scarred upon my brain. Addressed to the vilest harridan that scours the gutter for her carrion prey, they would have yet been inhuman, impossible; to the voice that answered . . . ! “It was a voice like the tinkling of a fairy bell. Whoever spoke was little more than a child; and her answer had the purity and strength of an angel. That even the foul monster who addressed her could support it, unblasted, was matter for astonishment. “Now the older voice broke into filthy insult, a very frenzy of malice. “I heard—O God!—the swish of a whip, and the sound of it falling upon flesh. “There was silence awhile, save for the hideous laughter of the invisible horror inside. “At last a piteous little moan. “My blood sang shrill within me. Out of myself, I sprang at the railings, and was over them in a second. Rapidly, and quite unobserved (for the scene was strenuous within), I climbed up the grating of the lower windows, and, reaching up to the edge of the balcony, swung myself up to and over it. “As I stopped to fetch breath, as yet unperceived, I took in the scene, and was staggered at its strangeness."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 117 “The room, though exquisitely decorated, was entirely bare of furniture, unless one could dignify by that name a heap of dirty straw in one corner, by which stood a flattish wooden bowl, half full of what looked like a crust of bread mashed into pulp with water. “Half turned away from me stood the owner of the harsh voice and soul abominable. It was a woman of perhaps sixty years of age, the head of an angel—so regular were the features, so silver-white the hair—set upon the deformed body of a dwarf. Hairy hands and twisted arms, a hunched back and bandy legs; in the gnarled right hand a terrible whip, the carved jade handle blossoming into a rose of fine cords, shining with silver—sharp, three-cornered chips of silver! The whole dripped black with blood. Upon the angel face stood a sneer, a snarl, a malediction. The effect upon one's sense of something beyond the ordinary was, too, heightened by her costume; for though the summer was at its height she was clad from head to foot in ermine, starred, more heavily than is usual, with the little black tails in the form of fleurs-de-lis. “In extreme contrast to this monster was a young girl crouching upon the floor. At first sight one would have hardly suspected a human form at all, for from her head flowed down on all sides a torrent of exquisite blonde gold, that completely hid her. Only two little hands looked out, clasped, pleading for mercy, and a fairy child-face, looking up—in vain—to that black heart of hatred. Even as I gazed the woman hissed out so frightful a menace that my blood ran chill. The child shrank back into herself. The other raised her whip. I leapt into the room. The old hag spat one infamous word at me, turned on me with the whip."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 118 “This time I was under no illusions about the sanctity of womanhood. With a single blow I felled her to the ground. My signet-ring cut her lip, and the blood trickled over her cheek. I laughed. But the child never moved—it would seem she hardly comprehended. “I turned, bowed. ‘I could not bear to hear your cries,' I said—rather obviously, one may admit. ‘I came—' adding under my breath, ‘I saw, I conquered.' ‘Who is that?' I added sternly, pointing to the prostrate hag. “ ‘Ah, sir' (she began to cry), ‘it is my mother.' The horror of it was tenfold multiplied. 'She—she——' The child blushed, stammered, stopped. “ ‘I heard, mademoiselle,' I cried indignantly. “ ‘I am here' (she sobbed) ‘for a month, starved, whipped— oh! By day the window barred with iron; by night, open, the more to mock my helplessness!' Then, with a sudden cry, her little pink hand darting out and showing a faultless arm: ‘Look! look! she is on you.' “The mother had drawn herself away with infinite stealth, regained her feet, and, a thin stiletto in her hand, was crouched to spring. Indeed, as she leapt I was hard put to it to avoid the lunge; the dagger-edge grazed my arm as I stepped aside. “I turned. She was on me, flinging me aside with the force of her rush as if I had been a straw. The snarl of her was like a wolf. “This time she cut me deep. Again a whirl, a rush.

Even so I had her by the waist, catching her arm, and with one heave of my back I tossed her into the air, careless where she might fall. “As luck would have it, she struck the balcony rail, broke it, and fell upon the pavement of the court. There was a crash, but no cry, no groan. I went to the balcony. She lay still, as the living do not lie, and her white hair was blackening, lapped by a congealing stream. “I withdrew into the room. Since I have learnt that any death brings with it a strange sense of relief. There is a certain finality. La comédie est jouée—and one turns with new life to the next business. “The golden child had never stirred. But now she crouched lower, and fell to soft, sweet crying. “ ‘Your mother is dead,' I said abruptly. 'May I offer you the guardianship of my godmother, the Duchess of Castelnaudary? Come, mademoiselle, let us go.' “ ‘I thank you, sir,' she answered, still sobbing; ‘but Jean is awake and at the door. Jean is fierce and lean as an old wolf.' “I pulled the dagger from the floor. ‘I am fierce and lithe as a young lion!' I said. ‘Let the old wolf beware!' “ ‘But I cannot, sir, I cannot. I . . .' Her confusion became acute. “ ‘I dare not move, sir—I—I—my mother has taken away all my clothes.' “I marvelled. In her palace of gold hair nobody could have guessed it. But now I blushed, and lively. The dilemma was absurd."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 120 “ ‘I have it,' said I. ‘I will climb down and bring up the ermine.' “She shuddered at the idea. Her dead mother's furs! “ ‘It must be,' I said firmly. “ ‘Go, brave knight!'—a delicate smile lit up her face—‘I trust myself to you.' “I bent on my right knee to her. ‘I take you,' I said, ‘to be my lady, to fight in your cause, to honour and love you for ever.' “She put out her right hand—oh, the delicate beauty of it! I kissed it. ‘My knight,' she said, ‘Jean is below; he may hear you; you go perhaps to your death—kiss me!' “With a sob I caught her once full in my arms, and our mouths met. I closed my eyes in trance; my muscles failed; I sank, my forehead to the ground before her. “When I opened my eyes again she too was praying. Softly, without a word, I stepped to the window, took the dagger in my teeth, dropped from the edge, landed lightly beside the corpse. She was quite dead, the skull broken in, the teeth exposed in a last snarl. She lay on her back; I opened the coat, turned her over. The gruesome task was nearly finished when the door of the house opened, and an old man, his face scarred, one lip cut half away in some old brawl, so that he grinned horribly and askew, rushed out at me, a rapier in his hand. My stiletto, though long beyond the ordinary, was useless against a tool of such superior reach. “A last wrench gave me the ermine cloak, an invaluable parry.

Then, almost before I knew what had happened, we were fighting in the street. I would not cry for help; one was more likely to rouse a bandit than a guardian of the peace. And, besides, who could say how the law stood? “I had certainly killed a lady; I was doing my best, with the aid of her stolen cloak, to kill a servant of the house; I contemplated an abduction. Best kill him silently, and be gone. “But when and how had Jean pulled open the iron gates and retreated into the street? “It mattered little, though certainly it left an uneasy sense of bewilderment; what mattered was that here we were fighting in semi-darkness—the dawn was not fairly lifted— for life and death. “ ‘Ten thousand crowns, Monsieur Jean,' I cried, ‘and my service!'—I gave him my style—‘I see you can be a faithful servant.' “ ‘Faithful to death!' he retorted, and I was sorry to have to kill him. “We fenced grimly on. “ ‘But,' I urged, ‘your mistress is dead. Your duty is to her child, and I am her child's—' “He looked up from my eyes. ‘An Omen!' he cried, pointing to the great statue of St. Michael trampling Satan,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 122 for we had come fighting to the Place St. Michel. ‘Darkness yields to light; I am your servant, sir.' He dropped on one knee, and tendered the hilt of his sword. “But as I put out my hand to take it (guarded against attack, I boast me, but not against the extraordinary trick which followed) he suddenly snatched at the ermine, which lay loosely on my left arm, and, leaving me with sword and dagger, fled with a shriek of laughter across the Place St. Michel, and, flinging the furs over the bridge, himself plunged into the Seine and swam strongly for the other bank. “There was no object in pursuing him; I would recover the furs, and return triumphant. Alas! they had sunk; they were now whirled far away by the swift river. Where should I get a cloak? “How stupid of me! The old woman had plenty of other clothes beneath her furs; I would take them. “And I set myself gaily to run back to the house. IIIIII “Whether by excitement I took the wrong turning, or whether—but you will hear!—in short, I do not clearly understand even now why I did not at once find the road. But at least I did fail to find it, discovered, as I supposed, my error, corrected it, failed once more. . . . In the end I got flustered—so much hung on my speedy return!—I fluttered hither and thither like a wild pigeon whose mate has been shot. I stopped short, pulled myself together. Let me think it out! Where am I now? I was under the shadow (the dawn just lit its edge) of the mighty shoulder of St. Sulpice. ‘More"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 123 haste, less speed!' I said to myself. ‘I will walk deliberately down to the boulevard, turn east, and so I cannot possibly miss the Carrefour de l'Odeon'—out of which, as I knew of old, the Rue des Quatre Vents leads. Indeed, I remembered the carrefour from that night. I had passed through it. I remembered hesitating as to which turning to take. For, as you know, the carrefour is a triangle, one road leading from the apex, four (with two minor variations just off the carrefour) from the base. “Following this plan, I came, sure enough, in three minutes or so into the Rue des Quatre Vents. It is not a long street, as you know, and I thought that I remembered perfectly that the house faced the tiny Rue St. Grégoire, which leads back to the Boulevard St. Germain. Indeed, it was down that obscure alley that Jean and I had gone in our fight. I remembered how I had expected to meet somebody on issuing into the boulevard; and then . . . I must have been very busy fighting: I could not remember anything at all of the fight between that issue and the place of Jean's feint and flight. “Well, here I was: the house should have been in front of me—and it was not. I walked up and down the street; there was no house of the kind, no railings. No residential house. Yet I could not believe myself mistaken. I pinched myself; I was awake. Further, the pinching demonstrated the existence of a sword and dagger in my hands. I was bleeding, too; my left arm twice grazed. I took out my watch; four o'clock. Since I left the bridge—ah! when had I left the bridge? I could not tell—yes, I could. At moon-set. The moon was nine days old. “No; everything was real. I examined the sword and"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 124 the stiletto. Silver-gilt; blades of exquisite fineness; the cipher of a princely house of France shone in tiny diamonds upon the pommels. “The thought sent new courage and determination thrilling through me. I had saved a princess from shame and torture; I loved her! She loved me, for I had saved her— ah! but I had not yet saved her. That was to do. “But how to act? I had plenty of time. Jean would not return to the house, in all probability. But the markets were stirring; the weapons and my blood would arouse curiosity. Well, how to act? “The positive certitude that I had had about the name of the street was my bane. Had I doubted I could have more easily carried out the systematic search that I proposed. But as it was my organized patrol of the quarter was not scientific; I was biased. I came back again and again to the street and searched it, as if the house might have been hidden in the gutter or vanished and reappeared by magic; as if my previous search might (by some incredible chance) have been imperfect, through relaxed attention. So one may watch a conjuror, observing every movement perfectly, except the one flash which does the trick. “The search, too, could not be long; so I reflected as disappointment sobered me. One cannot go far from the Carrefour de l'Odéon in any direction without striking some unmistakable object. The two boulevards, the schools, the Odéon itself, St. Sulpice—one could not be far off. Yet—could I possibly have mistaken the Odéon for the Luxembourg? “Could I . . . ? . . . ? A host of conjectures chased each"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 125 other through my brain, bewildering it, leading the will to falter, the steps to halt. “Beneath, keener anguish than the thrust of a poisoned rapier, stabbed me this poignant pang: my love awaits me, waits for me to save her, to fly with her . . . “Where was she? “It was broad day; I cleansed myself of the marks of battle, sat down and broke my fast, my sane mind steadily forcing itself to a sober plan of action, beating manfully down the scream of its despair. All day I searched the streets. Passing an antiquary, I showed him my weapons. He readily supplied their history; but—there was none of that family alive, nor had been since the great Revolution. Their goods? The four winds of heaven might know. At those words ‘the four winds’ I rushed out of the shop, as if stung by an adder. “I drove home, set all my servants hunting for railed houses. They were to report to me in the Rue des Quatre Vents. Any house not accounted for, any that might conceal a mystery, these I would see myself. “All labour lost! My servants tried. I distrusted their energy: I set myself obstinately to scour Paris. “There is a rule of mathematics which enables one to traverse completely any labyrinth. I applied this to the city. I walked in every road of it, marking the streets at each corner as I passed with my private seal. Each railed house I investigated separately and thoroughly. By virtue of my position I was welcome everywhere. But every night I paced the Rue des Quatre Vents, waiting . . . “Awaiting what? Well, in the end, perhaps death. The children gibed at me; passers-by shunned me."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 126 “ ‘Le Revenant,’ they whispered, ‘de la Rue des Quatre Vents.’ “I had forgot to tell you one thing which most steadfastly confirmed me in the search. Two days after the adventure I passed, hot on the quest, by the Morgue. Two women came out. ‘Not pretty, the fish!’ said one. ‘He with the scarred lip——' “I heard no more, ran in. There on the slab, grinning yet in death, was Jean. His swim had ended him. Faithful to death! “I watched long. I offered a huge sum for his identifica-tion. The authorities even became suspicious: why was I so anxious? How could I say? He was the servant of . . . “I did not know my sweet child's name! * * * * * “So, while a living man, I made myself a ghost. IV “It may have been one day some ten years later,” continued the old nobleman, \"when as I paced uselessly the Street of the Four Winds I was confronted by a stern, grey figure, short, stout, and bearded, but of an indescribably majesty and force. “He laid his hand unhesitatingly upon my shoulder. ‘Unhappy man!' he cried, ‘thou art sacrificing thy life to a phantom. “Look not,” quoth Zoroaster, “upon the Visible Image of the Soul of Nature, for Her name is Fatality.” What thou hast seen—I know not what it is, save that it is as"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 127 a dog-faced demon that seduceth thy soul from the sacred Mysteries; the Mysteries of Life and Duty.’ “ ‘Let me tell my story!’ I replied, ‘and you shall judge—for, whoever you may be, I feel your power and truth.’ “ ‘I am Eliphaz Levi Zahed—men call me the Abbé Constant,’ returned the other. “ ‘The great magician?’ “ ‘The enemy of the great magician.’ “We went together to my house. I had begun to suspect some trick of Hell. The malice of that devilish old woman, it might be, had not slept, even at her death. She had hidden the house beneath a magic veil? Or had her death itself in some strange way operated to—to what? Even conjecture paled. “But magic somewhere there must be, and Eliphaz Levi was the most famous adept in Paris at the time. “I told my story, just as I have told it to you, but with strong passion. “ ‘There is an illusion, master!' I ended. ‘Put forth the Power and destroy it!’ “ ‘Were I to destroy the illusion,' returned the magus, ‘thinkest thou to see a virgin with gold hair? Nay, but the Eternal Virgin, and a Gold that is not gold.’ “ ‘Is nothing to be done?’ “ ‘Nothing!’ he replied, with a strange light in his eyes. ‘Yet, in order to be able to do nothing, thou must first accomplish everything. “ ‘One day,’ he smiled, seeing my bewilderment, ‘thou wilt be angry with the fool who proffers such a platitude.’ “I asked him to accept me as a pupil. “I require pay,’ he answered, ‘and and oath.’"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 128 “ ‘Speak; I am rich.’ “ ‘Every Good Friday,' said the adept, ‘take thirty silver crowns and offer them to the Hospital for the Insane.’ “ ‘It shall be done,’ I said. “ ‘Swear, then,’ he went on, ‘swear, then, here to me’—he rose, terrible and menacing—‘by Him that sitteth upon the Holy Throne and liveth and reigneth for ever and ever, that never again, neither to save life, nor to retain honour, wilt thou set foot in the Street of the Four Winds; so long as life shall last.’ “Even as he bade me, I rose with lifted hand and swore. “As I did so there resounded in the room ten sharp knocks, as of ivory on wood, in a certain peculiar cadence. “This was but the first of a very large number of interviews. I sought, indeed, steadfastly to learn from him the occult wisdom of which he was a master; but, though he supplied me with all conceivable channels of knowledge—books, manuscripts, papyri—yet all these were lifeless; the currents of living water flowed not through them. Should one say that the master withheld initiation, or that the pupil failed to obtain it? “But at least time abated the monomania—for I know now that my whole adventure was but a very vivid dream, an insanity of adolescence. At this moment I would not like to say at what point exactly in the story fact and dream touch; I have still the sword and dagger. Is it possible that in a trance I actually went through some other series of adventures than that I am conscious of? May not Jean have been a thief, whom I dispossessed of his booty? Had I done this"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE DREAM CIRCEAN 129 unconsciously it would account for both the weapons and the scene in the Morgue. . . . But I cannot say. “So, too, I learnt from the master that all this veil of life is but a shadow of a vast reality beyond, perceptible only to those who have earned eyes to see withal. “These eyes I could not earn; a faith in the master sus-tained me. I began to understand, too, a little about the human brain; of what it is capable. Of Heaven—and of Hell! “Life passed, vigorous and pleasant; the only memory that haunted me was the compulsion of my oath that never would I again set foot in the Rue des Quatre Vents. “Life passed, and for the master ended. ‘The Veil of the Temple is but a Spider's web!' he said, three days before he died. I followed Eliphaz Levi Zahed to the grave. “I could not follow him beyond. “For the next year I applied myself with renewed vigour to the study of the many manuscripts which he had left me. No result could I obtain; I slackened. Followed the folly of my life: I rationalised. “Thus: one day, leaning over the Pont St. Michel, I let the whole strange story flow back through my brain. I re-membered my agony; my present calm astonished me. I thought of Levi, of my oath. ‘He did not mean for all my life,' I thought; ‘he meant until I could contemplate the affair without passion. Is not fear failure? I will walk through just once, to show my mastery.’ In five minutes—with just one inward qualm—again I was treading the well-worn flags of that ensorcelled road. “Instantly—instantly!—the old delusion had me by"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 130 the throat.

In vain you tell me, laughing, that if she ever lived, she is long since dead; or at least is an old woman, the blonde gold faded, the child-face wrinkled, the body bowed and lax. I laugh at you—at you—for a blaspheming ass. Your folly is too wild to anger me!” “I did not laugh,” said Roderic gravely. “Well,” said the old man, rising, “I fear I have wearied you . . .

A figure is therefore strongest in what is called its House; very strong in its Exaltation; strong in its Triplicity; very weak in its Fall; weakest of all in its Detriment. A figure is in its Fall when in a House opposite to that of its Exaltation; in is Detriment when opposite to its own House. The following list shows the Essential Dignities; that is to say, they follow the Dignities of their Ruling Planets, considering the twelve Houses of the scheme as answering to the twelve signs, thus: Asc. to a, 2 to b, 3 to c, &c., . . . 12 to l.

CHAPTER VII OF THE GENERAL METHOD OF JUDGING A FIGURE REMEMBER always that if | or q fall in the Ascendant, the figure is not fit for judgement. Destroy it instantly, and erect a new figure not less than two hours afterwards. Your figure being thoroughly arranged as on p. 144, note first to what House the demand belongs. Then look for Witnesses and Judge in their special table, and see what is said under the head of the demand. Put this down. Note next what figure falls into the House required (if it spring into other Houses, these too should be considered); e.g. in a question of money stolen, if the figure in 2nd be also in 6th it might show the thief to be a servant in the house. Look next in the Table of Figures in the Houses, and see what the figure signifies in the especial House under consideration. Put this down also. Then by the Table of Aspects (p. 158) note down the figures Â À D and Á, putting good on one side, evil on the other; noting also the strength or weakness, friendliness or hostility to the figure of the House required, of these figures. Then add the meaning of the figure in the 4th, to signify the end of the matter.

Now consider all you have written, and according to the balance of Good and Evil, form your final judgement. Consider also always in money questions where the Part of Fortune falls. Take, e.g., the figure on p. 144, and form a judgement for loss of money in business therefrom. Table of Witnesses and Judge say: Moderate. In 2nd is x. Evil, showing obstacle, delay. Part of Fortune , is in Asc. with v, showing loss through Querent’s own blunders. x springs into no other Houses; ∴ this does not affect the question. The figures Â and D of 2nd are w, t, s, and u, all good figures and friendly in nature = Well-intentioned help of friends. The figures À and Á are t, w, {, which are not hostile to x; therefore shows opposition not great. The figure in the 4th is t, which shows a good end, but with anxiety. Forming a Reconciler we get t again, a sympathetic figure but denoting delay = Delay, but helping Querent’s wishes. Adding all together— 1. Medium. 2. Evil and obstacles, delay; 3.

In the year 1899 he was graciously pleased to receive me as his pupil, and, living in his house, I studied daily under his guidance the Holy Qabalah. Upon his withdrawal—whether to enjoy his Earned Reward, or to perform the Work of the Brotherhood in other lands or planets matters nothing here—he bequeathed to me a beautiful Garden, the like of which hath rarely been seen upon Earth. It has been my pious duty to collate and comment upon this arcane knowledge, long treasured in my heart, watered alike by my tears and my blood, and sunned by that all-glorious Ray that multiplieth itself into an Orb ineffable. In this Garden no flower was fairer than this exquisite discourse; I beg my readers to pluck it and lay it in their hearts.

The Evolution of the Numbers is the Evolution of the Worlds, for as it is written in the Clavicula Salomonis, “The Numbers are Ideas; and the Ideas are the Powers, and the Powers are the Holy Elohim of Life.” That which is behind and beyond all Number and all thought (even as the Ain Soph with its Mighty Veils depending back from Kether is behind and beyond all Manifestation) is the number 0. Its symbol is the very Emblem of Infinite Space and Infinite Time.† Multiply it by any active and manifested number; and that number vanishes—sinks into the Ocean of Eternity. So also is the Ain Soph. From It proceed all Things: unto It all will return, when the Age of Brahman is over and done, and the day of Peace-Be-with-Us is declared by Thoth, * Here used in its true meaning of “the marshalling forth by number.” Qabalah, hlbq, by Tarot, “The Mystery shown forth in balanced disposition by Command.” † “ Hidden behind my Magic Veil of Shows, I am not seen at all—Name not my Name.”"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"A NOTE ON GENESIS 169 the Great God, and the Material Universe sinketh into Infinity. The first Number, then, is ONE; emblem of the All-Father; the Unmanifest Mind behind all Manifestation: the First Mind. Multiply by It any other Number—for the Multiplica-tion of the Numbers is a Generation, as is the Multiplication of Men and Gods—and behold! the Resultant is a replica of the Number taken. So is One the All-Father, the All-begetter—generating and producing all. The next step is the division into TWO. Thus was manifested the Great Dual Power of Nature. As above, so below. And thus we find that the simple division into two is the method of multiplication of the Amœba, the lowest, simplest, and most absolute form of physical life that we know. The Dual Power of Nature is the Great Mother of the Worlds. Again, to draw an analogy from the Material World, consider the Moon, our Mother. Behold in her the Typic representative of the Powers of the Two.

For the Mind of the Father said Into three, governing All Things by Mind. And there appeared in it the Triad, Virtue and Wisdom and Multiscient Truth.” Thus floweth forth the form of the Triad.† Thus is formulated the Creative Trinity which is, as it were, the essential preliminary to Manifestation. This Mystic Son of the Eternal Parents, having for his number 3, is typified in all the sacred scripts by that number. Thus it is written of the manifestation of the Son of God upon the Earth, “Shiloh shall come” (the initial of which Mystery-Name is c = 300).

So also in the Grade of Neophyte in the Order of the Golden Dawn the Hierophant weareth a robe of flame-scarlet as symbolic of the Dawn. NOTE.—It may be objected to this enunciation of the colours that y, the Father, is Fire; that h, the Mother, is Water; that w, the Son, is Air, and Yellow instead of Red. This also is true, but it relates to the governance of the Elemental Kingdoms, which are in the Astral Worlds, and whose monads are on the descending arc of Life, whilst Man is on the Ascending; that scale is therefore inverted.

Now let us consider this most Mystic Verse! The first thing that strikes us is that it contains Seven Words: the Second that the number of its letters is twenty-eight. Thus does it perfectly symbolise in its entirety the third Symbol in the numerical evolution. Before proceeding to a detailed analysis, and following the Process of Creation by Time (i.e., beginning at the first letter, and so proceeding), let me point out a few general facts. First as to the number of letters in each word, which converted into figures stands thus: 4.3.5.2.5.3.6. (Hebrew direction). In the midst is 2, by Taro the Central Will: and this two-lettered word is ta. On either side of this is the pair of figures 35—53, balanced one against the other: as though symbolic of the great dawning of life of the Mothers—h and #, vitalised by the SON (3) as the Vice-Gerent of His Father. These balanced figures together make 16, whereof the Key is 7; the total number of letters in the third Symbol. Then we have left at either end 4 and 6 = 10,* the perfection of the * Vide Sepher Yetzirah for this division of the Holy Sephiroth into a Hexad and a Tetrad."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 178 Sephiroth, as if to declare that this verse from, beginning to end thereof reflected the Voices from Kether even unto Malkuth: and 6 - 4 = 2 again, the Central Will, b, Thoth, in the Heart of the Universe (as in the centre of the verse). Note, then, this perfect equilibrium of the verse, and remember that Mystery—that equilibrium is strength. Let us now look at the letters themselves. Counting them, we find that the two central ones are am, the Supernal Mother; even as the number of letters had the dual symbol in their midst. Now their numeration is 41, yielding by Gema-tria lya = Force: Might: Power: lawag, Divine Majesty: and blja = Fecundity, all symbolic of the attributes of the Dual Polar Force and Mother. Moreover, 4 + 1 = 5 = h, Mother Supernal once again—and in its geometric symbol the Pentagram—the Star of Unconquered Will. Add the next two letters on either side, and we get EtDaC\\By, or a concealed Tetragrammaton. And this also reads \\y, the Great Sea, ta, Alpha and Omega, or Essence. Add the next two, so that the six central letters are obtained; and we read hta\\yh, which signifies \\yh, swollen, extended, or expanded; and hence Thou (i.e., God, Ateh, the All) in extension. But by Metathesis of these six letters is obtained tma hyh = “Truth Was,” as if affirming solemnly the presence in the Creation of the Supernal Truth. Now let us take the first and last letters of the verse and “cast into the midst thereof the Fire of the Sun”—i.e., w (6), “the Seal of Creation”—and we have {wb, an Egg.

The total numeric value of the verse is fntd = 4459, of which the Key is 22, the number of the Paths from a to t; and the Key of 22 is 4, the Tetractys and the Threshold of the Universe. Now to proceed to what I have termed the Time Process, the first Word of the Law then is tycarb. Now in the Hebrew Scriptures the first word of a Book is also its Title. Thus Genesis is called by the Rabbins “B'rasheth,” or “In the Beginning,” wherefore we may regard this Word as not the first word—albeit that is shadowed forth therein—but as the seal and title and Key of the whole book. Holding this in mind, let us proceed to analyse it. The number of its letters is six, the Seal of Creation, and their total numeric value is 2911. 2911 = 13 = Death, the Transformer*—the distinct formulation of the Three in One, uniting once more to produce the 4. Now Beth primarily signifieth a House or Abode, and in Taro it is #, the Magus—the Vox Dei—and Thoth, the Recorder. Coalesce these two ideas and we get b. “This is the Magical History.” r signifieth the Head or Beginning of Time and * As it is written: “Thy youth shall be renewed as the Eagle’s.” Now the Eagle is n. For further consideration of this 13, vide in the Portal Ritual the explanation of that terrible Key.

Theology is immaterial; for both Buddha and St. Ignatius were Christs. II. Morality is immaterial; for both Socrates and Mohammed were Christs. III. Super-consciousness is a natural phenomenon; its conditions are therefore to be sought rather in the acts than the words of those who attained it.

Trance is defined as the ek-stasis of one particular tract of the brain, caused by meditating on the idea corresponding to it. II.

And as with the individual so with the nation, the one or the many, it is taught to work its way into one narrow groove, and like the water in a drain or a gutter to flow for a time unobtrusively between dignified cobbles and over re-spectable cement, and then to vanish as genteelly as possible underground.

The one is taught the hero tales of his forefathers, the other the platitudes of the schools, which luckily are always a few decades behind the ideas current at his birth.

Perhaps during these years of nothingness we see things as they are; however, civilisation touches us on the lips and we speak and forget all about them. Directly we commence to chatter, our preparation to take life seriously begins.

If we are wild, it is naughty; if wanton—immoral; in innocence we lisp the ten commandments on our mothers’ knees, only to break them when we really know what they mean. Then comes manhood and its responsibility, marriage with its one pleasure and its forty thousand plagues, as Heine says.

What is the use then of doing anything if we are but as drops of water which are splashed between the wanton hands of the Sun, the Wind, and the Ocean?—indeed the ways of God are inscrutable and past finding out. Thus the Unobtainable tempts us, and the little segments of God that we see become to us the fiercest and most terrible of the Dog-faced Demons which seduce us from the path. He is always at our elbow, whispering, tempting, jeering, advising and helping us; He it is that casts despair upon us when we have done nothing wrong, and elation when we have done nothing right; He it is who is ever rising before us like a mist to obscure our path or to magnify our goal; yet nevertheless He is not only the cloud but that ultimate fire—if we could only understand Him as He IS; Ah! my brothers, this is THE GREAT WORK. Why does he do this and that, if he can do that and this? asks the Doubter. Because He chooses to, answers the Be-liever. But the man after God's own Heart thinks and reasons nothing, he feels there is neither doing nor choosing, and, dimly though it be, he sees that both of these foolish men, who think themselves so wise, possess but various little segments of one great circle, and that each imagines his seg-ment a perfect circumference in itself.

On he toils, at length it is the summit —no! but another ridge and a myriad more. A thousand fiends enter him, a thousand little sleuth-hounds that would tear him back—comfort, home, children, wife; then he says to himself: What a fool am I! At this stage many turn back and crawling into the valley of illusions reason how much more comfortable and interest-ing it is to read of mountain ascents than to accomplish them. These ones talk loudly and beat the drums of their valour in the ears of all men.

And presently so great grows the loneliness of the Mountain that his very companionship becomes as a temptation to you, you feel a friendliness in resisting him, a burning hope that he will continue to tempt you, that his temptations and his mocking words are better than no words at all. This only happens far far up the mountain slope, some say not so far from the summit; but take heed! for at this stage there is a great precipice, and those who look round for the hound may perchance stumble and fall—and the foot of that precipice is the valley from which they came. From here all is darkness, and there are no roads to guide the pilgrim, and the sleuth-hound can no more be seen because of the shadows of the night which obscure all things. And how can one write further about these matters? for those who have been so far and have returned, on account of the darkness saw nothing, therefore they have held their tongues.

From infancy he struggled through the chill darkness of his surroundings into boyhood, and as he grew and throve, so did the iniquity of that unnatural treatment which with lavish and cruel hand was squandered on him. Then youth came, and with it God’s name had grown to be a curse, and the form of Jesus stood forth in the gloom of Golgotha, a chill and hideous horror which vampire-like had sucked dry the joy of his boyhood; when suddenly one summer night he broke away from the ghouls that had tormented him, casting aside the sordid conventions of life, defying the laws of his land,"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 232 doubting the decaying religion of his childhood, he snapped, like rotten twigs, the worm-eaten conventionalities of the effete and hypocritical civilisation in which he had been nurtured, and sought refuse for a space in the wild and beau-tiful country which lies tangled like a head of tumbled hair to the north and north-west of England. Here he learnt from the whispering winds and the dreamy stars that life was not altogether a curse, and that every night dies in the arms of dawn. His freedom, however, was of but short duration; yet, though he was dragged back to the prison from which he had escaped, he had learnt his own strength, a new life had flowed like a great sea dancing with foam upon him, and had intoxicated him with the red wine of Freedom and Revolt—his gauntlet of youth had been cast down, henceforth he would battle for his manhood, ay! and for the manhood of the World! Then the trumpet-blast resounded; the battle had indeed begun! Struggling to his feet, he tore from him the shroud of a corrupted faith as if it had been the rotten cerement of a mummy. With quivering lip, and voice choked with indignation at the injustice of the world, he cursed the name of Christ and strode on to seek the gate of Hell and let loose the fiends of the pit, so that mankind might yet learn that compassion was not dead.

Deeply read in poetry, philosophy and science, gifted beyond the common lot, and already a poet of brilliant promise; he suddenly hurries from out the darkness like a wild prophetic star, and overturning the desks and the stools of the schoolmen, and casting their pedagogic papilla from his lips, escapes from the stuffy cloisters of mildewed learning, and the colleges of dialectic dogmatics, and seeks, what as yet he cannot find in the freedom which in his youthful ardour appears to him to live but a furlong or two beyond the spires and gables of that city of hidebound pedants which had been his school, his home, and his prison. Then came the great awakening. Curious to say, it was towards the hour of midnight on the last day of the year when the old slinks away from the new, that he happened to be riding alone, wrapped in the dark cloak of unutterable thoughts. A distant bell chimed the last quarter of the dying year, and the snow which lay fine and crisp on the roadway was being caught up here and there by the puffs of sharp frosty wind that came snake-like through the hedges and the trees, whirling it on spectre-like in the chill and silver moonlight. But dark were his thoughts, for the world had failed him. Freedom had he sought, but not the freedom that he had gained.

Master!” he cried, “I have found Thee . . . O silver Christ. . . .” Then all was Nothingness . . . nothing . . . nothing . . . nothing; and madly his horse carried him into the night. Thus he set out on his mystic quest towards that goal which he had seen, and which seemed so near; and yet, as we shall learn, proved to be so far away. In the first volume of the diaries, we find him deep in the study of the Alchemistic philosophers. Poring over Paracelsus, Benedictus Figulus, Eugenius and Eirenaeus Philalethes, he sought the Alchemical Azoth, the Catholicon, the Sperm of the World, that Universal Medicine in which is contained all other medicines and the first principle of all substances. In agony and joy he sought to fix the volatile, and transmute the formless human race into the dual child of the mystic Cross of Light, that is to say, to solve the problem of the Perfect Man. Fludd, Bonaventura, Lully, Valentinus, Flamel, Geber, Plotinus, Ammonius, Iamblichus and Dionysius were all devoured with the avidity and greed which youth alone possesses; there was no halting here— “ ‘Now, master, take a little rest!’—not he!

He who dismisses Paracelsus with a twopenny clyster, or Raymond Lully with a sixpenny reprint, is not a fool, no, no, nothing so exalted; but merely a rabbit-brained louse, who, flattering himself that he is crawling in the grey beard of Hæckel and the scanty locks of Spencer, sucks pseudo-scientific blood from the advertisement leaflets of our monthly magazines, and declares all outside the rational muckheap of a Pediculus to be both ridiculous and impossible.

From the cloudless skies of Mysticism he rushes down into the infernal darkness on winged thoughts: “The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the western sea,” and we find him now in the Goetic king-doms of sorcery, witchcraft, and infernal necromancy.

Knorr von Rosenroth's immense storehouse of Qabalistic learning seems to have kept P. fully employed until the autumnal equinox, when B——, the alchemist of note, intro-duced him to a Mr. C—— (afterwards, as we shall see, Frater V∴N∴ of the Order of the Golden Dawn). This meeting proved all-important, as will be set forth in the following chapter. Through C——, P. had for the time being laid aside von Rosenroth, and was now deep in “The Book of * At this time P. was leading a hermit's life on a Swiss glacier with one whom, though he knew it not at the time, was destined ever and anon to bring him wisdom from the Great White Brotherhood.

I wearied myself much in looking for Thee without, and yet Thou hast Thy habitation within me, if only I desire Thee and pant after Thee.

It may be of some interest to the reader, and also it may in some ways help to elucidate the present chapter, if a short account of the origin of this order is first entered upon. But it will be understood that the following historical sketch, as well as the accounts we are about to give of the rituals them-selves, are very much abbreviated and summarised, when we state that. the actual MSS. in our possession relating to the G∴ D∴ occupy some twelve hundred pages and contain over a quarter of a million words. The official account of the G∴ D∴ (probably fiction) known as “The Historical Lecture,” written and first delivered by Frater Q. S.

It runs as follows: “Some years ago a number of cipher MSS. were discovered and deciphered by certain students. They attracted much attention, as they purported to derive from the Rosicrucians.

It was written by one of them that S.D.A.’s scheme had always been regarded with disapproval. But since the absolute rule of the adepts is never to interfere with the judgements of any other person whomsoever – how much more, then, one of themselves, and that one most highly revered! – they had refrained from active opposition. The adept who wrote this added that the Order had already quite enough knowledge to enable it or its members to formulate a magical link with the adepts. “Shortly after this, one called S.R.M.D. announced that he had formulated such a link, and that himself and two others were to govern the Order. New and revised rituals were issued, and fresh knowledge poured out in streams. “We must pass over the unhappy juggleries which characterised the next period. It has throughout proved impossible to elucidate the complex facts. “We content ourselves, then, with observing that the death of one of his two colleagues, and the weakness of the other, secured to S.R.M.D. the sole authority.

At the Eastern part of Malkuth, at its junction-point with the path of t is placed the altar in the form of a double cube. Its colour is black to represent to the Neophyte the colour of Malkuth; but to the adept there lies hidden in the blackness the four colours of the Earth, in their appropriate positions on the sides. The base only is wholly black; whilst the summit will be of a brilliant whiteness although invisible to the material eye. “The symbols upon the altar represent the forces and manifestations of Divine Light concentrated in the white triangle of the Three Supernals. Wherefore upon this sacred and sublime symbol is the obligation of the Neophyte taken as calling therein to witness the operations of the Divine Light. The red cross of Tiphereth representing 5°=6° is placed above the white triangle; not as dominating it, but as bringing it down and manifesting it unto the Outer Order: as though the Crucified One having raised the symbol of Self-Sacrifice had thus touched and brought into action in matter the Divine triad of Light. “Around the cross are the symbols of the four letters of Tetra-grammaton, the c of Jeheshua being only implied and not expressed in the Outer.

They represent, as it were, Veiled Divinities, and their seats are before the veil (Paroketh) which is divided into two parts at the point of the rending, as though it answered unto the veils of Isis and Nephthys impenetrable save to the initiate.

The Hierophant then calls upon all present to assist him in opening the Hall of the Neophytes, and bids the Kerux see that the Hall is properly guarded. The Fratres and Sorores of the Order then give the sign of the Neophyte, after which the Hiereus explains that the names of the three chief officers commence with “the letter of breath” H. But that in the name Osiris, the H is silent, and concealed, as it were shrouded in O. In the name Horus it is manifested and violently aspirated; while in the name Themis it is partly one and partly the other. The Hiereus having explained the meaning of the letter H, then recapitulates the stations and duties of the officers, thus occultly affirming the establishment of the temple so that the Divine Light may shine into the Darkness. In explaining his own station the Hierophant says: “My place is on the throne of the East, which symbolises the rise of the Sun of Life and Light. My duty is to rule and govern this hall in accordance with the laws of the Order. The red colour of my robe symbolises Light: my insignia are the sceptre and the Banner of the East, which signify Power and Light, Mercy and Wisdom: and my office is that of the Expounder of the Mysteries.” Then follows the purification of the Hall and the members by water and by fire, after which the Hierophant orders the Mystic Circumambulation to take place in the Path of Light. The procession of officers and members is then formed in the North, in readiness for the mystic Circumambulation in the Path of Light. It is formed in the North beginning from the station of the Stolistes, the symbol of the waters of creation attracting the Divine Spirit, and therefore alluding to the creation of the world. Whilst the “Reverse Circumambulation” has its rise from the station of the Dadouchos, symbolic of the ending and judging of the world by fire. But also the Circumambulation commences with the Paths c and r, as though bringing into action the solar fire; whilst the reverse commences by those of q and x as though bringing the watery reflux into action. This is the Order of the Circumambulation; first cometh Anubis, the watcher of the Gods; next Themis, the Goddess of the Hall of Truth; then Horus; then the remaining members in order of precedence; and lastly, the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance, as though a vast wheel were revolving, as it is said: “One wheel upon the Earth beside the Kerub.” And also note the Rashish ha-Gilgalim.* Of this wheel the ascending side commenceth from below the pillar of Nephthys, and the descending side from below the pillar of Isis, but in the “Reverse Circumambula- * The beginning of Whirling Motions, Primum Mobile."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 252 tion” this is contrary. And the nave or axis of the wheel will be about the invisible station of Harpocrates; as though that God stood there with the sign of Silence, and affirmed the concealment of that central atom of the wheel which alone revolveth not. The object of the Mystic Circumambulation is to attract and make connection between the Divine Light above and the Temple, and therefore the Hierophant quitteth his throne to take part therein, but remaineth there to attract by his sceptre the Light from beyond the Veils. Each member in passing the Throne of the East gives the sign of the enterer, projecting forwards the light which cometh from the sceptre of the Hierophant. \"But Horus passes only once, for he is the son of Osiris, and inheriteth the Light, as it were by birthright from him; wherefore he goeth at once unto the station of the Hiereus to fix the light there. The Hegemon, the Goddess of Truth, passeth twice because her rule is of the Balance of the two Scales, and she retireth to her station there to complete the reflux of the Middle Pillar. But Anubis of the East and the others circumambulate thrice as affirming the completion of the reflexion of the perfecting of the white Triangle on the Altar.”* The circumambulation being completed, the members and remaining officers remain standing whilst the Hierophant repeats the Adoration: “ HOLY ART THOU, LORD OF THE UNIVERSE! HOLY ART THOU, WHOM NATURE HATH NOT FORMED! HOLY ART THOU, THE VAST AND THE MIGHTY ONE! LORD OF THE LIGHT AND OF THE DARKNESS!” (At each of these sentences all bow and give the sign, the officers raising their banners, sceptres, sword and wand on high, and then sink them in salutation.) The Hierophant then orders the Kerux to declare the Hall of the Neophytes opened by him, which he does in the following words: “In the name of the Lord of the Universe, I declare that the Sun hath arisen, and that the Light shineth in Darkness.” After which the three chief officers repeat the mystic words: “ KHABS AM PEKHT!” “ KNOX OM PAX!” “ LIGHT IN EXTENSION!” THE OPENING is then at an end, and the next ceremony is: THE ADMISSION.† The Candidate is in waiting without the Portal, under the care of the sentinel, the “Watcher Without,” that is, under the care of the form of Anubis of the West. * Z. 1. † The following explanatory remarks on the Admission and Ceremony of the Neophyte are taken from the MS. called Z. 3."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 253 The Hierophant informs the members assembled that he holds a dispensation from the greatly honoured chiefs of the Second Order, for the purpose of commencing the process of the initiation which shall ultimately lead the Candidate to the knowledge of his Higher Self. But he is first admitted to the Grade of Neophyte which hath no number, concealing the commencement of All-Things under the simulacrum of No-Thing. The Hegemon, the representative of the Gods of Truth and Justice, is consequently sent to superintend the preparation, thus symbolizing that it is the Presider of Equilibrium who is to administrate the process of initiation by the commencement of the Equilibration of the forces in the Candidate himself, by the symbols of Rectitude and Self-control. But it is the sentinel who actually prepares the Candidate; whose body is now surrounded by a triple cord to show the restriction of the powers of Nature; and it is triple to show the white Triangle of the Three Supernals. His eyes are also bandaged, symbolising that the Light of the natural world is but as darkness compared with the radiance of the Light Divine. The Ritual then continues: Hegemon: “Child of Earth! arise, and enter into the Path of Darkness!” The Hierophant then gives his permission, ordering the Stolistes and Dadouchos to assist the Kerux in the reception; but the Kerux bars the way saying: “Child of Earth! unpurified and unconsecrated! Thou canst not enter our Sacred Hall.” Whereupon the Stolistes purifies the Candidate by Water, and the Dadouchos consecrates him by Fire. Then the Hierophant speaks: he does so not as to an assembly of mortals, but as a God before the assembly of the Gods. “And let his voice be so directed that it shall roll through the Universe to the confines of Space, and let the Candidate represent unto him a world which he is beginning to lead unto the knowledge of its governing angel. As it is written: ‘The lightning lighteneth out of the East and flameth even unto the West, even so shall be the coming of the Son of Man!’ ” The Candidate during the ceremony is addressed as “child of Earth” as representing the earthly and material nature of the natural man: he who cometh forward from the darkness of Malkuth to strive to regain knowledge of the Light. Therefore it is that the path of the initiate is called the Path of Darkness; for it is but darkness and foolishness to the natural man. The Hierophant giving his permission to the Kerux to admit the Candidate, seals the Candidate with a motto as a new name. This motto is not a name given to the outer man’s body, but an occult signifier of the aspiration of his soul. “In affirmation of this motto, now doth Osiris send forward the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance to baptize the aspirant with water and with fire. Even as it is written: ‘Except a man be born of water and of the spirit: in no wise shall he enter unto the Kingdom of Heaven’ ”"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 254 The Kerux, however, at once bars the way, as the Candidate is still unpurified. Thereupon the Goddesses of the Scales purify and consecrate him. This is the first consecration. “But even as there be four pillars at the extremities of a sphere when the ten Sephiroth are projected therein; so also are there four separate consecrations of the Candidate.” The reception and consecration takes place in the black portion of Malkuth; when it is finished the Candidate is conducted to the foot of the altar, the citrine portion of Malkuth, and the part receiving the impact of the Middle Pillar. The Hierophant then says to the Candidate: “Child of Earth! wherefore hast thou come to request admission to this Order?” The Hegemon answers for the Candidate: “My soul is wandering in the Darkness seeking for the light of Occult Knowledge, and I believe that in this Order the Knowledge of that Light may be obtained.” Whereupon the Hierophant asks the Candidate whether he is willing “in the presence of this assembly to take a great and solemn obligation to keep inviolate the secrets and mysteries of our Order?” To which the Candidate himself replies: “I am.” The Hierophant now advances between the Pillars as if thus asserting that the Judgment is concluded: “And he advanceth by the invisible station of Harpocrates unto that of the Evil Triad; so that as Arouerist* he standeth upon the Opposer.” He thus cometh to the East of the Altar, interposing between the place of the Evil Triad and that of the Candidate. At the same time the Hiereus advanceth on the Candidate's left, and the Hegemon standeth at his right, as formulating about him the symbol of the Triad, before he be permitted to place his right hand in the centre of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals on the Altar. And he first kneeleth in adoration of that symbol, as if the natural man abnegated his will before that of the Divine consciousness. The Hierophant now orders the Candidate to kneel (in the midst of the triad Arouerist, Horus and Themis), to place his left hand in that of the initiator, and his right hand upon the white triangle as symbolising his active aspiration towards his Higher Soul. The Candidate then bows his head, and the Hierophant gives one knock with his sceptre; affirming that the symbol of submission into the Higher is now complete. Only at that moment doth the colossal image of Thoth† Metatron cease from the sign of the enterer: and giveth instead the sign of the silence: permitting the first real descent of the Genius of the Candidate, who descendeth into the invisible station of Harpocrates as witness unto the obligation. All then rise and the Candidate repeats the Obligation after the Hierophant. In it he * He is Osiris when throned; when he moves he assumes the form of Arouerist. † Thoth is one of the Invisible officers."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 255 pledges himself to keep secret the Order, its name, and the names of the members, as well as the proceedings which take place at its meetings.

He then swears to observe the above under the awful penalty of submitting “myself to a deadly and hostile current of will set in motion by the chiefs of the Order, by which I should fall slain or paralyzed without visible weapon, as if blasted by the lightning flash!* (Hiereus here suddenly applies sword.) So help me THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE and my own Higher Soul.” As the Candidate affirmeth his own penalty should he prove a traitor to the Order, the evil triad riseth up in menace, and the avenger of the Gods, Horus, layeth the blade of his sword on the point of the Daäth junction (i.e., of the brain with the spine) thus affirming the power of Life and Death over the natural body: and the Form of the Higher Self advanceth and layeth its hand on the Candidate's head for the first time, at the words: “So help me the Lord of the Universe and my own Higher Soul.” And this is the first assertion of the connecting-link between them. Then after this connection is established doth the Hierophant in the following words raise the Candidate to his feet: “Rise, newly obligated Neophyte in the 0°=0° Grade of the Order of the G∴ D∴ in the Outer. Place the Candidate in the Northern part of the Hall, the place of the greatest symbolic Darkness.” The Candidate is then placed in the North, the place of the greatest symbolic Darkness, the invisible station of Taaur the Bull of Earth. But therein dwelleth Ahapshi the rescuer of Matter, Osiris in the Sign of the Spring. That as the earth emergeth from the Darkness and the Barrenness of Winter, so the Candidate may thus affirm the commencement of his emancipation from the darkness of ignorance. The Hierophant and Hiereus return to their thrones, therefore it is not Arouerist but Osiris himself that addresseth the Candidate in the words: “The voice of my Higher Soul said unto me: let me enter the path of Darkness, peradventure thus shall I obtain the Light; I am the only Being in the abyss of Darkness: from the Darkness came I forth ere my birth, from the silence of a primal sleep! And the Voice of Ages answered unto my soul: I am he who formulates in Darkness. Child of Earth, the Light shineth in Darkness, but the Darkness comprehendeth it not.” And this is to confirm the link established between the Neschamah and the Genius by communicating the conception thereof unto the Ruach. Thus, therefore, Osiris speaketh in the Character of the Higher Soul, the symbolic form of which is now standing between the pillars before him. The Second Circumambulation then takes place in the Path of Darkness, the symbolic Light of Occult Science leading the way. This light of the Kerux is to show that the * A later edition of the Ritual, issued subsequent to the Horos scandals, reads \"an awful and avenging punitive current,\" &c."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 256 Higher soul is not the only Divine Light, but rather a spark from the Infinite Flame. After the Kerux comes the Hegemon, the translator of the Higher Self, leading the Candidate, then the Stolistes and Dadouchos. Once they pass round the temple in solemn procession: it is the foundation in Darkness of the Binah angle of the whole Triangle of the Ineffable Light. The Hierophant knocks once as then pass him, and the Hiereus does likewise, as the affirmations of Mercy and Vengeance respectively. A second time they pass the Hierophant affirming the commencement of the formulation of the angle of Chokmah. The Kerux then bars the Candidate's passage to the West, saying: “Child of Earth! unpurified and unconsecrated! Thou canst not enter the Path of the West!” Thus indicating that the natural man cannot even obtain the understanding of the “Son” of Osiris, except by purification and equilibrium. The Candidate is then purified with water and consecrated by fire; after which he is allowed to approach the Place of the Twilight of the Gods. And now only is the hoodwink slipped up for a moment to obtain a glimpse of the Beyond. The Hiereus then challenges as follows: “Thou canst not pass by me, saith the Guardian of the West, unless thou canst tell me my Name.” In this challenge is signified the knowledge of the Formula; and that without the formula of Horus being formulated in the Candidate, that of Osiris cannot be grasped. To the Candidate this appears as the anger of God; for he cannot as yet comprehend that before Mildness can be exercised rightly the Forces both of Severity and Mercy must be known and wielded. Therefore the Hegemon answers for him: “Darkness is thy Name! Thou art the Great One of the Path of the Shades.” The Hegemon then suddenly lifts the veil, and the Candidate sees before him standing on the steps of the throne the Hiereus with sword pointed to his Breast. Slowly sinking the blade the Hiereus says: “Child of Earth, fear is failure: be thou therefore without fear! for in the heart of the coward Virtue abideth not! Thou hast known me, so pass thou on!” The Candidate is then re-veiled. Then the Kerux again bars his way, saying: “Child of Earth! unpurified and unconsecrated! Thou canst not enter the Path of the East.” This Barring of the Path is an extension of the meaning of the previous one, and the commencement of the formulation of the Angle of Kether. Once again is the Candidate purified with water and consecrated by fire; and the hoodwink is slipped up to give a glimpse of the Light as dimly seen through"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 257 Darkness yet heralding a Glory which is in the Beyond. The Hierophant, then slowly lowering his sceptre, says: “Child of Earth! remember that Unbalanced Force is evil. Unbalanced Mercy is but weakness: Unbalanced Severity is but oppression. Thou hast known me; pass thou on unto the Cubical Altar of the Universe.” Thus formulating the Force of the Hidden Central Pillar. The Hierophant then leaveth his throne and passeth between the pillars, halting at either the station of Harpocrates, the place of the Evil Triad, or at the East of the Altar. The Hiereus standeth on the left of the Candidate, and the Hegemon on his right. Thus again completing the formulation of the Triad of the Three Supernals. The Hierophant and Hiereus may hold their banners; anyhow it is done astrally; and the Higher Self of the Candidate will be formulated once more in the Invisible station of Harpocrates. The Hierophant than says: “Let the Candidate kneel, while I invoke the LORD OF THE UNIVERSE!” After the prayer has been solemnly repeated, the Hierophant says: “Let the Candidate rise,”* and then: “Child of Earth! long hast thou dwelt in Darkness! Quit the Night, and seek the day.” Then only at the words: “Let the Candidate rise” is the hoodwink definitely removed. The Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hegemon join their sceptres and sword above the Candidate's head, thus formulating the Supernal Triad, and assert that they receive him into the Order of the Golden Dawn, in the words: “Frater X Y Z, we receive thee into the Order of the Golden Dawn!” They then recite the mystic words, “KHABS AM PEKHT,” as sealing the current of the Flaming Light. But the Higher Soul remaineth in the Invisible Station of Harpocrates, and to the Spirit Vision, at this point, there should be a gleaming white Triangle formulated above the forehead of the Candidate and touching it, the symbol of the white Triangle of the Three Supernals. The “Hierophant” now calleth forward the Kerux, and turning towards the Candidate says to him: “In all your wanderings through darkness, the lamp of the Kerux went before you though you saw it not! It is the symbol of the Hidden Light of Occult Science.” It here representeth to him a vague formulation of his ideal, which he can neither grasp not analyse. Yet this Light is not the symbol of his own Higher Self, but rather a ray from the Gods to lead him there. The Hierophant then continues: * Meaning also: “Let the Light arise in the Candidate.”"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 258 “Let the Candidate be conducted to the East of the Altar. Honoured Hiereus, I delegate to you the duty of entrusting the Candidate with the secret signs, grip, grand word and present pass-word of the 0°=0° Grade of the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, of placing him between the mystic pillars, and of superintending his fourth and final consecration.” The East of the Altar is the place of the Evil Triad, and he is brought there as though affirming that he will trample upon and cast out his evil persona, which will then become a support unto him, but it must first be cast down unto its right place. The Hiereus now confers the secret signs, &c., and during this part of the ceremony the position of the three chief officers is as follows: The Hierophant on the throne of the East; the Hiereus at the East of the Black Pillar; and the Hegemon at the East of the White Pillar. The three again formulating the Triad and strengthening it. Thus the Higher Soul will be formulated between the Pillars in the place of Equilibrium; the Candidate at the place of the Evil Triad. The Hiereus now advanceth between the Pillars unto the invisible station of Harpocrates. The signs having been explained, the Hiereus draweth the Candidate forward between the pillars, and for the second time in the ceremony the Higher Soul standeth near and ready to touch him. Then the Hiereus returneth to the East of the Black Pillar so that the three chief officers may draw down upon him the forces of the Supernal Triad. The Candidate now therefore is standing between the pillars bound with the rope, like the mummied form of Osiris between Isis and Nephthys. And in this position doth the fourth and final consecration by the Goddesses of the Balances take place; the Aspirant for the first time standing between the pillars, at the point wherein are localized the equilibrated forces of the Balances, and meanwhile the Kerux goeth to the North in readiness for the Circumambulation, so as to link the latter with the final consecration of the Candidate. The Stolistes then says: “Frater X Y Z, I finally consecrate thee by water.” And the Dadouchos: “Frater X Y Z, I finally consecrate thee by fire.” And the effect of this is to seal finally into the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate the Pillars in Balanced Formulation. For in the natural man the symbols are unbalanced in strength, some being weaker and some stronger, and the effect of the ceremony is to strengthen the weak and purify the strong, thus gradually commencing to equilibrate them, at the same time making a link between them and their corresponding forces in the Macrocosm. The Hierophant then says: “Honoured Hegemon, the final consecration of the Candidate having been performed, I command you to remove the rope from his wast, the last remaining symbol of Darkness; and to invest him with the distinguishing badge of the grade.”"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 259 The Hegemon, executing the Hierophant's order, says: “By command of the Very Honoured Hierophant, I invest you with the distinguishing badge of the grade.

For the free will of the Candidate as a natural man is never obsessed, either by the Higher Soul, or by the ceremony. But the Will consenting, the whole of the ceremony is directed to the strengthening of its action. And as this badge is place upon him, it is as though the two Great Goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, in the places of the columns, stretched forth their wings over the form of Osiris to restore him again unto life. The Mystic Circumambulation then followeth in the Path of Light to represent the rising of the Light in the Candidate through the operation of self-sacrifice; as he passeth the Throne of the East, the red Cavalry Cross is astrally formulated above the astral White Triangle of the Three upon his forehead; so that so long as he belongeth unto the Order he may have that potent and sublime symbol as a link with his Higher Self, and as an aid in his search for the Forces of the Light Divine for ever, if he only will it. But the Higher Soul or Genius returneth unto the Invisible Station of Harpocrates, into the Place of the hidden centre, yet retaining the link formulated with the Candidate. The address of the Hierophant then follows: “Frater X Y Z, I must congratulate you on your having passed with so much fortitude through your ceremony of the admission to the 0°=0° Grade of the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer. I will now direct your attention to a brief explanation of the principal symbols of your grade.” When these have been explained the Kerux, as the Watcher Anubis, announceth in the following words that the Candidate has been admitted as an initiate Neophyte: “In the name of the LORD OF THE UNIVERSE and by command of the V.H. Hierophant, hear you all that I proclaim that A: B: who hereafter will be known unto you by the motto X Y Z, has been admitted in due form to the 0°=0° Grade of Neophyte of the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer.” The Hiereus then addresseth the Neophyte and congratulates him upon being admitted a member of the Order, “whose professed object and end is the practical study of Occult Science.” After which the Hierophant stateth clearly the Principia which the Neophyte must now commence to study. This being at an end the Kerux conducteth the Neophyte to his table and giveth him a solution telling him to pour a few drops on the plate before him. As he does so"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 260 the solution changes to a blood colour, and the Kerux says: “As this pure, colourless, and limpid fluid is changed into the semblance of blood, so mayest thou change and perish, if thou betrayest thine oath of secrecy of this Order, by word or deed!” The Hierophant then says: “Resume your seat in the N.W., and remember that your admission to this order give you no right to initiate any other person without dispensation from the greatly honoured chiefs of the Second Order.” Thus ends the Admission, after which the Closing takes place. THE CLOSING The Closing Ceremony is opened by the cry: “HEKAS, HEKAS, ESTE, BEBELOI!” and the greater part of its symbolism is explained in the Opening. The reverse circumambulation is intended to formulate the withdrawal of the Light of the Supernal Triad from the Altar. The Adoration then takes place, after which followeth the mystical repast, or communion in the body of Osiris. Its mystic name is “The Formula of the Justified One.”* The Hierophant saying: “Nothing now remains but to partake in Silence the Mystic repast composed of * The “Formula of Osiris” is given in Z. 1, and is as follows: “For Osiris Onnophris hath said: He who is found perfect before the Gods hath said: These are the elements of my body, perfected through suffering, glorified through trial.

The Hiereus comes to the West of the Altar, and salutes the Hierophant, receiving the elements from him. All then partake in order of rank: Hegemon from Hiereus, Stolistes from Hegemon, Dadouchos from Stolistes, Senior Members from Dadouchos, and the Kerux from the Candidate. But the Kerux says: “It is finished,” inverting the cup, to show that the symbols of Self-sacrifice and Regeneration are accomplished. And this proclamation is confirmed by the Hierophant, and the three chief officers give the three strokes emblematic of the Mystic Triad, and in the three different languages repeat the three mystic words: “KHABS AM PEKHT!” “KONX OM PAX!” “LIGHT IN EXTENSION!” The Hierophant then finally closes the ceremony by saying: “May what we have this day partaken of, sustain us in our search for the Quintessence; the Stone of the Philosophers; the True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness, and the Summum Bonum.” All then disrobe and disperse. Undoubtedly the passing through the Ritual of the Neophyte had an important influence on P.'s mind, and on his Spiritual Progress; for shortly after its celebration, we find him experiencing some very extraordinary visions, which we shall enter upon in due course.

Frater Neophyte, by what aid do you seek admission to the 1°=10° Grade of Zelator of the G∴ D∴?” The Hegemon, answering for him, says: “By the guidance of Adonai; by the pos-session of the requisite knowledge; by the dispensation you hold; by the secret signs and token of the 0°=0° Grade, and by this symbol of the Hermetic Cross.” The Neophyte is then conducted to the West, and being placed between the mystic pillars, pledges himself to secrecy. The Hierophant, congratulating him, finally says: “Let the Neophyte enter the path of Evil.” Then the following takes place. Hiereus: Whence comest thou? Kerux (for Neophyte): I am come from between the pillars and seek the hidden knowledge in the Name of Adonai. Hiereus: And the Angel Samael (Angel of Evil) answered and said: I am the Prince of Darkness and of Night. The wicked and rebellious man gazeth upon the face of Nature and he findeth therein naught but terror and obscurity; unto him it is but the Darkness of the Darkness; and he is but as a drunken man groping in the dark. Return, for thou canst not pass by. Hierophant: Let the Neophyte enter the path of Good. Hegemon: Whence comest thou? Kerux (for Neophyte): I am come from between the pillars and seek for the hidden Light of Occult Knowledge. * The following five Rituals are considerably abridged; chiefly to economise space and so allow the rituals of the Neophyte and Adeptus Minor to be dealt with more fully.

Hiereus and Hegemon: Whence comest thou? Kerux (for Neophyte): I am come from between the pillars and seek for the hidden Light of Occult Science. Hierophant: But the great Angel Sandalphon answered and said: \"I am the Reconciler for the Earth and the Soul of the Celestial therein. Equally is form invisible in total Darkness and in Blinding Light. . . .” The Hiereus and Hegemon return to their seats, whilst the Hierophant and Neophyte remain, both facing the Altar. Here the Hierophant confers on the Neophyte the Secrets and Mysteries of the grade; and explains to him the Symbolism of the Temple as follows: “The three portals facing from the East are the gates of the paths which alone conduct to the Inner. . . .” “The letters shin, tau, and qoph, make by metathesis tcq (Qesheth), which signifies a bow, the rainbow of promise stretched over our earth. This picture of the Flaming Sword of the Kerubim is a representation of the guardians of the gate of Eden; just as the Hiereus and the Hegemon symbolise the two paths of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.” “You will observe that in this grade the red cross is placed within the white Triangle upon the altar, and thus placed, it is identical with the Banner of the West.” “The triangle refers to the three above-mentioned paths connecting Malkuth with the above Sephiroth, while the cross is the hidden wisdom of the Divine nature which can be obtained by their aid. The two construed mean: LIFE IN LIGHT.” “This grade is especially referred to the Element Earth, and therefore, one of its principal emblems is the Great Watch-tower on the Terrestrial Tablet of the North. . . .” “. . . You will observe that the Hermetic Cross, which is also called Fylfat, . . . is formed of seventeen squares taken from a square of twenty-five lesser squares. DIAGRAM 12. The Flaming Sword.

In this grade the lamps on the Pillars are unshaded, showing that you have quitted the darkness of the outer. . . .” The Neophyte then retires for a short time before commencing the second ritual of this grade, which consists chiefly of symbolic explanations: The Hierophant says: “While the 0°=0° grade represents the portal of the Temple, the 1°=10° grade of Zelator will admit you into the Holy Place. Without, the altar of Burnt Offering symbolises the Qliphoth—or evil demons. Between the Altar and the entrance to the Holy Place stood the Laver of Brass, as a symbol of the Waters of Creation.” The Hegemon then explains the symbolic drawing of the Zodiac, which is most complicated, but consists mainly of twelve circles and a lamp in the centre to represent the sun. “The whole figure represents the Rose of Creation, and is a synthesis of the Visible Universe. Furthermore the twelve circles represent the twelve foundations of the Holy City of the Apocalypse, while in the Christian symbolism the Sun and the twelve signs typify our Saviour and the twelve Apostles.”* After which the Hiereus says: “At the Southern side of the Holy Place stood the seven-branched candlestick. The sym-bolic drawing before you represents its occult meaning. The seven circles which surround the heptagram represent the seven planets and the seven Qabalistic Palaces of Assiah, the material world which answer to the seven apocalyptic churches of Asia Minor, and these again represent, on a higher plane, the seven lamps before the throne.”† * See 777, Col. cxl., p. 27, “Twelve Banners of the Name,” and Revelations, xxi., 19, 20.  † See 777, Col. xxxvi., p. 11. !bjfchedial DIAGRAM 14.

The lamp within the centre re-presents the Astral Light of the Universe concentrated into a focus by the Planets. . . .” The Hierophant then resumes: “Within the mystic veil which separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies stood the Ark of the Covenant. Before the veil stood the altar of Incense, of which this altar is a symbol. It was in the form of a double Cube, thus representing material form as the reflection and the duplication of that which is spiritual.

Learn then to separate the pure from the impure, the refined and spiritual gold of the Alchymist from the Black Dragon of Putrefaction in Evil.” . . . “I now congratulate you on having attained to the 1° = 10° grade of Zelator, and in recognition thereof I confer on you the mystic title of PERECLINOS DE FAUSTIS, which signifies that you are still far from the goal which has been reached by the complete Initiates.” Shortly after this the Closing takes place, and the prayer of the spirits of the Earth is rehearsed, and the licence to depart pronounced, and in the name of ADONAI HA ARETZ, the Hierophant declares the Temple closed. By the end of January 1899, P. was sufficiently advanced to be admitted to the grade of Theoricus. It was about this time also that he met Mr. D., a certain brother of the G∴ D∴ known as Fra. I.A. This meeting, as we shall eventually see, ranks only second in importance to his meeting with Fra. V.N. RITUAL OF THE 2° = 9° GRADE OF THEORICUS This grade is particularly attributed to the element of Air; it refers to the Moon, and is attached to the Thirty-second Path of Tau, which alludes to the Universe as composed of the four elements, to the Kerubim, the Qliphoth, the Astral Plane, and the reflection of the Sphere of Saturn. After all this has been explained, the Advancement of the Zelator takes place, after which the Ritual of the Thirty-second Path is celebrated. Hierophant, to Zelator: “Facing you are the Portals of the thirty- second, thirty-first, and twenty-ninth Paths leading from the grade of Zelator to the three other grades which are beyond. The only path now open to you, however, is the thirty-second, which leads to the 2°=9° grade of Theoricus, and which you must traverse before arriving at that degree. Take in your right hand the Cubical Cross, and in your left hand the Banner of Light, and follow your guide Anubis* the Guardian: who leads you from the Material to the Spiritual.” * It will be noticed that from here this ritual becomes unnecessarily complicated with Egyptian deities—in fact, its mysteries become rather “forced.” Still more so will this be seen in the next ritual, which becomes ridiculously complex with Samothracian nonentities. The symbols in themselves are not wrong; but it is the “mixed-biscuit” type of symbol which is so bad, especially where it is not necessary, but chosen so as to “show off” superficial knowledge."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 267 Kerux: “Anubis the Guardian spake unto to Aspirant, saying: ‘Let us enter into the Presence of the Lords of Truth.’ Arise and follow me.” Hiereus: “The Sphinx of Egypt spake and said: ‘I am the synthesis of the Elemental Forces: I am also the symbol of man: I am Life: and I am Death: I am the Child of the night of Time.’ ” Hierophant: “The priest with the mask of Osiris spake and said: 'Thou canst not pass the gate of the Eastern Heaven: except thou canst tell me my name.’ ” Kerux, for Zelator: “Thou art Nu: The Goddess of the Firmament of Air. Thou art Harmakhis, Lord of the Eastern Sun.” Hierophant: “In what sign and symbol dost thou come?” Kerux, for Zelator: “In the letter Aleph, with the Banner of Light, and the symbol of equated forces.” Hierophant (falling back and making with fan the sign of Aquarius, k, before Zelator): “In the sign of the man, child of Air, art thou purified—pass thou on.” Similarly the Zelator passes the Lion, the Eagle, and the Bull. The Hierophant then explains to the Zelator the symbolism of the cubical cross, as follows: “The cubical cross is a fitting emblem of the equilibrated and balanced forces of the Elements. It is composed of twenty-two squares externally, which refer to the twenty-two letters placed thereon. Twenty and two are the letters of the Eternal Voice in the vault of Heaven; in the depths of the Earth; in the abyss of the Waters, and in the all-presence of Fire: Heaven cannot speak their fulness, Earth cannot utter it. Yet hath the Creator bound them in all things. He hath mingled them through Water: He hath whirled them aloft in Fire: He hath sealed them in the Air of Heaven: He hath distributed them through the Planets: He hath assigned unto them the twelve constellations of the Zodiac.” He then explains that to the Thirty-second Path of the Sepher Yetzirah is attributed the seven Abodes of Assiah; to the four Elements, the Kerubim, and the Qliphoth.* * See 777, cols. civ., cviii., pp. 20 and 23; and Revelations, chap. i. tqcHHiereusHegemonKeruxLights ShadedRed LampTablet of AirTablet of EarthGSaltLampHellEdenDaisPentacleFanFanCup21stKey ofTarot DIAGRAM 20.

Her two wands are the directing forces of the Positive and Negative currents. She is the synthesis of the Thirty-second Path uniting Malkuth and Yesod. DIAGRAM 21. The Cubical Cross of Twenty- two Squares. DIAGRAM 22. The Garden of Eden and the Holy City. The Hegemon then explains his tablet, which contains the occult symbolism of the Garden of Eden and the Holy City of the Apocalypse; and the Kerux also his—the seven Infernal Mansions and the four Seas.* After which the Hierophant confers on the Zelator the title of the Thirty-second Path; the Zelator then quits the Temple for a short time before passing to the Grade of Theoricus. The Ceremony of Theoricus is opened by the Hierophant, who says to the Zelator: “Frater Pereclinos de Faustis: as in the grade of 1°=10° there were given the symbolical representations of the Tree of Knowledge of the Good and Evil of the gate of Eden and of the Holy Place: so in the 2° = 9° of Theoricus the ‘Sanctum Sanc-torum’ with the Ark and the Kerubim is shown: as well as the garden of Eden, with which it coincides, while in the thirty-second path leading thereunto, through which you have just passed, the Kerubic Guardians are represented; and the Palm-trees, or trees of Progression in the Garden of Eden. Honoured Hegemon, conduct the Zelator to the West, and place him there before the portal of the thirty-second path through which he has just entered.” The Zelator then seeks entrance by the Caduceus of Hermes, the symbolism of which the Hegemon explains to him. * See 777, cols. cvi., cvii., p. 23."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 269 cma DIAGRAM 24.

The connecting paths are twenty-two in number, and are distinguished by the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, making with the ten Sephiroth themselves the thirty-two paths of Wisdom of the Sepher Yetzirah.” The letters, he then points out to him, form the symbol of the Serpent of Wisdom, and the Sephiroth the Flaming Sword. “The two pillars right and left of the Tree are the symbols of the active and passive, male and female—Adam and Eve. . . . The pillars further represent the two Kerubim of the Ark; the right, male—Metatron; and the left, female—Sandalphon.

The Closing then takes place. “Let us adore the Lord and King of Air!” says the Hierophant. The prayer of the Sylphs follows; and in the Name of SHADDAI EL CHAI the Temple is closed in the 2°=9° Grade of Theoricus. The following month, February, P. passed through the next grade, that of 3°=8°. RITUAL OF THE 3° = 8° GRADE OF PRACTICUS This Grade is particularly attributed to the element of Water, and especially refers to the planet Mercury and to the thirty-first and thirtieth paths of c and r. It opens with the Adoration to the King of the Waters, which is followed by the Advancement. The Theoricus first gives the necessary signs, and then, as before, solemnly pledges himself to secrecy, after which he is conducted to the East and placed between the Mystic Pillars. The Hierophant then says to him: “Before you are the portals of the thirty-first, thirty-second and twenty-ninth paths. Of these, as you already know, the central one leads from the 1°=10° of Zelator to the 2°=9° of Theoricus. That on the left hand, which is now open to you, is the thirty-first, which leads from the 1°=10° of Zelator to the 3°=8° of Practicus.

They were of a much lower order than the Eleusinian, and a great deal more obscure; in fact, even at the time, people could not define with anything like accuracy what the Kabiri really were. The student will find more concerning these semi-mythical beings in Strabo, Diodorus and Varro. Döllinger says: “This much is undoubted on the joint testimony of Strabo and Mnaseas; the gods whose initiation people received here (Samothrace) were Axieros, i.e., Demeter; Axiokersos, i.e., Hades; and Axiokersa, i.e., Persephone.—Döllinger, “The Gentile and the Jew,” Eng. edition, 1906, vol. i., pp. 172-186."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 271 In this ritual the Three Cabiri are made to represent the triangle of fire, thus: Axieros, the first Kabir, says: “I am the apex of the Triangle of Flame: I am the Solar Fire pouring forth its beams upon the lower world: Life-giving, Life-producing.” Then Axiokersos, the second Kabir, says: “I am the left-hand basal angle of the Triangle of Flame: I am Fire, Volcanic and Terrestrial, flashing and flaming through the deep abysses of Earth: Fire rending, fire penetrating, tearing asunder the curtains of Matter; fire constrained; fire tormenting; raging and whirling in lurid storm!” And lastly, Axiokersa, the third Kabir, says: “I am the right-hand basal angle of the Triangle of Flame. I am Fire, Astral and Fluid, winding through the Firmament of Air. I am the life of Being, the vital heat of Existence.” The Hierophant then takes the solid triangular pyramid and explains: “The solid triangular Pyramid is an appropriate hieroglyph of fire. It is formed of four triangles, three visible and one concealed: which latter is the synthesis of the rest. The three visible triangles represent Fire, Solar, Volcanic and Astral; while the fourth represents latent heat. The three words: dwa bwa rwa refer to three conditions of heat: Aud, Active; Aub, Passive;* Aur, the Equilibrated; while ca (Ash) is the name of Fire.” “The Thirty-first Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, which answereth to the letter c, is called the Perpetual Intelligence; and it is so called because it regulateth the motions of the Sun and Moon in their proper order; each in an orbit convenient for it. It is, therefore, the reflection of the sphere of Fire; and the path connecting the material universe, as depicted in Malkuth, with the Pillar of Severity and the side of Geburah through the Sephira Hod.” He then explains to the Theoricus the twentieth Key of the Tarot. It is a glyph of the powers of Fire. The angel crowned with the Sun is Michael, the ruler of Solar Fire. The serpents which leap in the rainbow are symbols of the fiery Seraphim. The trumpet represents the influence of the Spirit descending upon Binah; and the banner with the cross refers to the four rivers of Paradise.

It is therefore the reflection of the Sphere of the Sun; and the Path connecting Yesod with Hod, the Foundation with Splendour.” And then enters upon the symbolism of the Nineteenth Key of the Tarot, which resumes these ideas: The Sun has twelve principal rays which represent the Zodiac; these are divided into thirty-six rays to represent the thirty-six Decantes; and then again into seventy-two Quinaries. Thus the Sun itself embraces the whole creation in its rays. The seven Hebrew Yodhs falling through the air refer to the Solar influence descending. “The two children, standing respectively on Water and Earth, represent the generating influences of both, brought into action by the rays of the Sun. They are the two inferior and passive elements, as the Sun and the Air above them are the superior and active elements of Fire and Air.” Furthermore, these two children resemble the sign Gemini (which the Greeks and Romans referred to Castor and Pollux), which unites the Earthly sign of Taurus and the Watery sign of Cancer. The Hiereus then shows the Theoricus the tablet of “The astrological symbols of the Planets,”* and explains to him the tablet of “The true and genuine attribution of the Tarot Trumps to the Hebrew Alphabet.”† After which the Hegemon leads him to “The Tablet of the Olympic, or aerial planetary spirits,”‡ and shows him “The Geomantic Figures” with the ruling intelligences and genii, also the Talismanic symbols allotted to each geomantic figure.§ The Hierophant now confers upon the Theoricus the title of Lord of the Thirteenth Path, who quits the Temple for a short time.

And in the garden were the Tree of Life, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which latter is from Malkuth . . . and a river Nahar went forth out of Eden, namely, from the Supernal Triad, to water the garden—the rest of the Sephiroth.

Take in your right hand the Solid pyramid of the Elements and follow your guide through the Path.” Then, as before, the Hierophant raises his red lamp, and cries: “The Priestess with the Mask of Isis spake and said: ‘I am the rain of Heaven descending upon the Earth, bearing with it the fructifying and germinating power. I am the plenteous yielder of Harvest; I am the cherisher of Life.’ ” . . . . . . . “The Priestess with the Mask of Nephthys spake and said: 'I am the dew descending, viewless, and silent, gemming the Earth with count-less Diamonds of Dew, bearing down the influence from above in the solemn darkness of Night.’ ” After which the Hegemon says: “The Priestess with the Mask of Athoor spake and said: 'I am the ruler of mist and of cloud, wrapping the Earth as it were with a garment, floating and hovering between Earth and Heaven.

The infernal waters of Daäth rushed from the mouth of the Dragon—and this is the Leviathan. Tetragrammaton Elohim placed four letters of the Holy Name, and also the flaming sword, that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam.” The Hierophant then explains the symbolism of the Temple, and says: “I now congratulate you on having passed through the cere-mony of the 4°=7° of Philosophus and in the recognition thereof, I confer upon you the mystic title of ‘P H A R O S I L L U M I-NANS’ which signifies—the Illuminating Tower of Light, and I give you the symbol of ca (Ash), which is the Hebrew name for fire.

THE CEREMONY At the bidding of the Hierophant Inductor the Associate Adept places the Candidate in the West between the Banner and the Black Pillar, before the Elemental Tablets, but facing the West. After which he presents him to the Hierophant Inductor. The Hierophant Inductor then ad-dresses the Philosophus and points out to him that if in the previous grades much information was imparted to him; it was done as a test of his trustworthiness. Continuing he says: “I therefore now ask you before proceeding further in the Order, to pledge yourself to the following, laying your hand upon the Central Tablet in the midst of the four Elemental Tablets.” The Philosophus then promises never to reveal the Secrets of this Ritual; never to use his practical Occult Knowledge for Evil; to use his influence only for the honour of God, not to stir up strife; and to uphold the authority of the Chiefs of the Order. After which he confirms his obligation by saying, “I undertake to maintain the Veil between the First and Second Orders and may the powers of the elements bear witness to my pledge.” The Associate Adept then explains to the Philosophus the admission badge, which is the peculiar emblem of the Hiereus of a Temple of the first Order. And the Hierophant Inductor explains the Hierophant's Lamen and the Banner of the East, thus completing his knowledge of the Emblems appropriate to the Officers of a Temple of the First Order.

Therefore by this straight and narrow Path of s let the Philosophus advance like the arrow from the centre of tcq (Qsheth) the Bow of Promise; for by this hieroglyphic of the arrow hath Sagittarius ever been represented. And as this sign of Sagittarius lieth between the signs Scorpio (Death) and Capricornus (the Devil) so hath Jesus to pass through the wilderness tempted by Satan. But Sagittarius the Archer is a Bi-corporate sign, the Centaur, the Man and the Horse combined. Recall what was said unto thee in the passage of the 31st Path of Fire leading into the 3°=8° of Practicus. ‘Also there is the vision of the Fire-flashing Courser of Light, or also a child borne aloft on the shoulders of the Celestial Steed, fiery and clothed with Gold, or naked, and shooting from the Bow shafts of Light, and standing on the shoulders of the horse.

Associate Adept, will you explain to the Philosophus the 13th Key of the Tarot.” Associate Adept: The 13th Key of the Tarot represents the figure of a skeleton. The five extremities of the Body, delineated by head, hands and feet, allude to the powers of the Number five, the letter h, the Pentagram comprehending the concealed Spirit of Life and the four Elements, the originators of all living forms. The sign Scorpio especially alludes to stagnant and fetid water; and to that property of the moist nature which initiates putrefaction and corruption. The eternal change from Life to Death, and through Death to Life, is symbolised in the grass which springs from and is nourished by putrefying and corrupting carcasses. The top of the scythe forms the T, Tau-Cross of Life, showing that what destroys also renews. The Scorpion, Serpent and Eagle delineated before the figure of Death in the more ancient form of the Key, refer to the mixed transforming (therefore deceptive) nature of this emblem. The Scorpion is the emblem of ruthless destruction, the Snake is the mixed and deceptive nature, serving alike for good and evil, and the Eagle is the Higher and Divine nature yet to be found herein, the alchemical Eagle of Distillation, the Renewer of Life. As it is said: “Thy youth shall be renewed like the Eagle’s.” Great indeed and many are the Mysteries of this Terrible Key!

In his left hand, which points downwards, he holds a lighted torch, and in his right hand, which is elevated, a horn of water. The cubical Altar represents the Universe. The whole figure shows the gross generating powers of nature on the material plane, and is analogous to the Pan of the Greeks and the Egyptian Goat of Mendes. As his hands bear the torch and the horn, the symbols of Fire and Water, so does his form unite the Earth in his hairy and bestial aspect, and the Air in his bat-like wings. The whole would be an evil symbol were it not for the Pentagram of Light above his head which regulates and guides his movements. The figure of Pan is then explained, after which the Hierophant Inductor shows the Philosophus the 14th Key of the Tarot. The more ancient form shows us a female figure crowned with a crown of five rays symbolising the five Principles of Nature, the Concealed Spirit and the four Elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. About her head is a halo of Light. On her breast is the Sun of Tiphereth. The five-rayed crown further alludes to the five Sephiroth of Kether, Chokmah, Binah, Chesed and Geburah. Chained to her waist are a lion and an eagle, between which is a large cauldron whence arise steam and smoke. The Lion represents the Fire of Netzach, the Blood of the Lion; and the Eagle represents the Water of Hod, the Gluten of the Eagle; whose reconcilement is made by the Air in Yesod uniting with the volatised Water rising from the cauldron though the influence of the Fire beneath it. The chains which link the Lion and the Eagle to her waist are symbolic of the paths of n and u, Scorpio and Capricornus as shown by the Scorpion and the Goat in the background. In her right hand she bears the torch of solar fire, elevating and volatizing the Water in Hod by the fiery influence of Geburah; while with her left hand she pours from a vase the waters of Chesed to temperate and calm the fire of Netzach.

As it is said: “stoop not down, for a precipice lieth beneath the Earth; a descent of Seven steps; and therein is established the throne of an Evil and Fatal force. Stoop not down unto that dark and lurid world, defile not thy brilliant flame with the earthy dross of Matter. Stoop not down, for its splendour is but seeming, it is but the habitation of the sons of the unhappy.” The lamp and cup are then replaced, after which the following symbols are explained to the Philosophus: The Image of Nebuchadnezzar’s Vision; The Symbol of the Great Hermetic Arcanum; The Tablet of Union between the four Elements; The tablet of the Symbolic Latin Names; The Seven Palaces of the Briatic World; and the Kerubim in the Visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel and St. John. The Hierophant Inductor now congratulates the Philosophus on the progress he has made, and proclaims him Master of the 24th, 25th, and 26th Paths in the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts. After which the Closing of the Portal takes place, the Hierophant Inductor saying: “In and by that word Paroketh I declare the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts duly closed. Unto thee O Tetragrammaton be ascribed Malkuth, Geburah, and Gedulah unto the Ages. Amen.” So finishes the Ritual of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts, the connecting ritual between the grades of Philosophus and Adeptus Minor, between the First and the Second Order. But before we close this chapter, it will be necessary, briefly though it may be, to trace out the effect these six rituals and the mass of occult knowledge which appertains to them, had upon P., and further might be expected to have on the ordinary seeker in the mysteries of Truth. To even the most casual student it must be apparent, once he has finished reading these rituals, that though they contain much that is scholarly and erudite, besides much that is essential and true, they, however, are bloated and swollen with much that is silly and pedantic, affected and misplaced, so much so that wilful obscurity taking the place of a lucid simplicity, the pilgrim, ignorant as he must be in most cases, is"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 289 spontaneously plunged into a surging mill-race of classical deities and heroes, many of whom thrust themselves boisterously upon him without rhyme or reason. Ushered as it were into a Judgment Hall in which the law expounded to him is not only entirely unknown but is written in a language which he cannot even read, he is cross-questioned in a foreign tongue and judged in words which at present convey not a symptom of sense to him. As the Rituals proceed it might be expected that these difficulties would gradually lessen, but this is far from being the case; for, as we have seen, the complexities already involved by the introduction of Ancient Egyptian deities, concerning whom it is probable the candidate has but little knowledge, are further heightened by a general intrusion on the part of Hebrew, Christian, Macedonian and Phrygian gods, angels and demons, and a profuse scattering of symbols; which, unitedly, are apt either so to bewilder the candidate that he leaves the temple with an impression that the whole ritual is a huge joke, a kind of buffoonish carnival of Gods which in the sane can only provoke laughter; or, on account of it being so utterly incomprehensible to him, his ignorance makes him feel that it is so vastly beyond him and above his own simple standard of knowledge, that all that he can do is to bow down before those who possess such an exalted language, concerning even the words and alphabet of which he can get no grasp or measure. The result of this obscurity naturally is that in both cases the Rituals fail to initiate—in the first case they, not being understood, are jeered at; in the second they, though equally incomprehensible, are however revered.

The result being, as it proved in most cases, as disastrous as it was lamentable. There is a time and a place for everything, and there is a right use for the affectation of knowledge just as there is a wrong one. When a child has learnt the simple rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division; it is legitimate to ask it to solve some simple little problem; but it is sheer waste of time to ask it: “If twenty-four sprats cost a shilling, and one sprat will make a meal for two children, how many children can you feed for twopence halfpenny?” before it knows that one plus one equals two. If a child is never taught to add one to one it is possible that even when grown up, the man to his dying day will look upon the setter of the twopenny-halfpenny sprat question as an advanced mathematician, perhaps even as an “advanced occultist.” But when he has learnt the meaning of one plus one equals two, he will find this vast unthinkable problem to be after all but as simple as adding one to one or two to two. The affectation of knowledge and the piling on of symbols is only legitimate to the ignorant when the purpose is to bewilder by a flashing image and not to instruct. In the present case the seeker after Truth is called the Child of Earth and Darkness, and instead of being shown the beautiful garment of light he will one day be called upon to wear, is at once rolled in a heap of tinselled draperies, in mummy wrappings, outgrown togas and the discarded underwear of"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 291 Olympus and Sinai, the result being that unless his under-standing is as clear as these rituals are obscure, all he obtains is a theatrical impression of “make-up” and “make- believe,” and a general detachment from the realities of Consciousness. The words obsess him; he cannot see that Typhon is as necessary in the Egyptian Scheme as Osiris; in the Christian, that Satan is but the twin of Christ. They fetter the freedom which they are supposed to unbind, producing not only a duality but a multiplicity of illusions; so that, in the end, the chances are, instead of conversing face to face with Adonai, he becomes a prig addressing a mass meeting in the Albert Hall, rationalising about irrational qualities. Fortunately in the case of P. the result was somewhat different; already master of a vast storehouse of knowledge and learning he was less likely to gasp “Oh my!” at the display of Egyptian pyrotechnics than many of the others; he was in fact enabled by their help to weld to his knowledge a catalogue of disruptive learning, and from it add many words to the great dictionary of magical language he was at this time eagerly attempting to construct. This construction of a language should be the object of all rituals; they should bring the seeker step by step nearer to his quest, that is to say, to perfect him in the tongue he one day hopes to speak. Each Ritual, be it a letter, a word, a sentence, or a volume, should contain a lesson clear and precise, it should leave behind it so bright and dazzling a picture that the very thought of it will at once conjure up the power dressed in its simple yet luminous symbols.

Of course it may be urged that as they constitute four great trials, it is after all a greater test to be placed under a false guide than an honest one. But indeed, if this be so, then most certainly should the Neophyte, Zelator, Theoricus or Practicus travel his own road unhelped by others; further, he should not be tempted by others, and when he is hopelessly entangled be relieved of his trials like the reader of a fairy-tale who invariably finds that after the most monstrous difficulties the hero and heroine always marry and live happily ever afterwards.

The path which connects Hod with Netzach is the 27th path of the Sepher Yetzirah which answers to the letter p. It is the reflection of the Sphere of Mars and is the lowermost of the reciprocal paths. The Tarot Key attributed to this path is very rightly the 16th Key—the Tower; which we have seen in the 4°= 7° Ritual represents a tower struck by a flash of lightning, symbolising the Tower of Babel struck by the wrath of Heaven, and also the Power of the Triad rushing down and destroying the columns of darkness, the light of Adonai glimmering through the veils and consuming the elementary Rituals of the 1°=10°, 2°=9°, 3°=8°, and 4°=7° grades.

Thus we find him, as it were, figuring before him a Pentagram and saying: “It is not complete without its top point.” This is undoubtedly correct, but at this time he still failed to realise that when once the Supernal Triad has descended and is resting on the topmost point of the Pentagram, this being now the point of juncture becomes the most important of all points, and that the lower four are little better than supports, legs and arms to the body whose head now wears the Crown.

This vision was undertaken to obtain rest. It took place in the actual temple built by P., and, as was generally the case, it was commenced by the “Lesser Banishing Ritual.” “Slowly the actual temple in which I was standing became wonderfully beautified, and a white shining film floated in feathers over the surface of the floor on which I was standing, and winding itself about me, formed a great column which carried me up through the roof to a great height. Then I found, as the cloud fell away from me, that I was standing in a fair green field, and by me in great solemnity stood a shining steel-grey-silver figure, unarmed. “ ‘Welcome,’ said the stranger with a cold dignity. “Then he led me to a blue pool of water, and bade me plunge into it, which I did, half diving and half swimming, sending a million sparkling sapphires of water dancing in the light. “The water was deliciously cool and refreshing, and as I struck out in it, I soon saw that I must have made a mistake, for the far shore was a great distance from me, and on it I could see shining a silvery palace."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 313 “As I neared it I leapt to the shore, and there I found, as I approached the wonderful building, many beautiful creatures playing about it. But my haste in leaving the blue waters had been ill-advised; for suddenly a great cloud of water enveloped me, and catching me up, carried me to a great height. Then I discovered that I had been changed into a lily, whose white petals were unfolded, and that I was growing in a garden, white with a multitude of the same wonderful flowers. “Not over long had I been there, when the form of man was again given to me, and I threw my arms above my head and then extended them, forming a cross. “I was standing in silver-grey garments, and before me was a great white marble temple. At once I prostrated myself, and then entered. Before me I saw that all was white and fine within, and that in the temple stood a cubical altar of silver. “I knelt before the altar; and as I did so a coldness and moisture seemed to descend upon me, which thrilled me with a delicious freshness like the falling dew. From it a cool stream arose, in the limpid waters of which I bathed my hands. Whilst in this position an angel descended with a green garment and gave it me. At first I was unwilling to wear it, but presently I did so, and after I had worn it a little while, I sacrificed it before me, when at once it became a crown of fire. “Then a voice said to me: ‘Wilt thou be of the guard?’ and before I could answer yea, or nay, most lovely maidens surrounded me and armed me in silver armour and a red tabard."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 314 “From where I had been standing I was led to the Northern entrance, where crowded a great concourse of people, and as I approached them they gave way before me. Then a voice whispered to me ‘Smite’; thereupon, drawing my sword with fury I smote three times, upon which a great wailing arose. “Having smitten down many with those three blows, I descended among them, but left my sword behind me. Thinking I had forgotten it, in vain I tried to return, and in my strivings was of a sudden armed with many potent lightnings; then at my feet there fell away a great hollow column of rolling smoke. Seeing it, I approached it and gazing down it, beheld at its furthermost extremity the earth, dark and strong. As I watched it rolling below me, a great desire possessed me to expand my consciousness and include All. This took me a vast time to accomplish, and even then my success was but moderate. “From the column of smoke I returned to the outside of the temple and re-entered it by the Western door. Finding a gold crown upon my head, I held it up, and in the white vapour it glowed like a white light. Then an angel approached me and pressed it on to my brow, and as this was done, a feeling possessed me as if a cold shower of gold was falling through me. Then of a sudden was I carried upwards, and found myself in a second temple. Here I was conducted to the south, where stood a glittering shrine, and the light which flashed from it pierced me through and through. Blinded by the effulgence, I was led to the North to another shrine (Binah) where my eyes were anointed with cold molten silver, and immediately I saw vaguely before me a female form."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 315 “After this I returned to the central altar, where everything fell from me, and then I returned to earth, assuming my sword and red robe to dominate the astrals.

On, on I flew, until at length I became surprised at the great distance of my journey. “Eventually I arrived in a strange land, and after some perplexity assumed a divine figure, which I believe to be that of Diana. Then I called Sappho, and immediately she appeared before me, a small dark woman with a wonderful skin and a copper sheen on her dark hair. Her face was very lovely, but her expression was ablaze with intense desire, and through her wild floating hair could be seen her eyes, in which glittered madness. “On seeing me, she knelt down before me, and I, trying to comfort her, extended my hands to her, which she in turn kissed. Behind her stood the white astrals of weeping women —these were her many lovers. “After a while I brought her into the circle in which I was standing, and raising her up, caressed her upon the forehead. Then I changed to my usual shape, at which she was exceedingly amazed, and only comforted when I told her of my great love for her. Thereupon we rose together, embracing, to a place where angels greeted us. Here we were told to go between the pillars into the temple; which we did, and saw in front of us an immense kneeling figure of some Oriental Deity."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 316 “Before us glared a human face above a human body with arms and feet; but behind it, it was as the body of a lion. “Sappho then gave me the 0°=0° sign, which I returned, whereupon the great figure rose and blessed us, and we embraced. Then I knelt before Sappho and said: “ ‘You have given me of your strength and brought me into this place of blessing; I will now give you of mine.’ “For answer she held my hands in hers, and wonderful tinglings of glory and passion flowed into me like live fire. I raised my head to her bosom, and kissed her passionately, and then I notice that I too was a woman! “An angel approached me and advised restraint, and so with a great calmness I passed within her body, and at once felt all her passion and longings. A mighty joy and glory encompassed me, and we became a great brown bird taking part in a mystic ceremony, the priest being the great man-lion; then again we rose and re-assumed human shape, but larger than before. “Now we saw standing before us a venerable, beautiful and kingly figure (Tiphereth), holding a flaming sword of dazzling whiteness. This he extended to us, whilst his attendants, who were angelic figures, sang a low, melodious tune. Then he placed it in our mouth, when at once there rushed from our lips an infinite and intolerable song, which presently ceased, when the sword was returned to the king. “Then I noticed that the sun was burning below us, so once again assuming the form of the brown bird, we flitted round the sun, bathing in its fiery flames and molten substance. “Presently I wished to return; but could not separate myself from her, for I was absorbed in Sappho. Becoming"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 317 desperate, I called thrice unto Acheirah, who soon appeared; whereupon I explained to him my trouble. Seizing his sword, he smote at us, and we were again two human beings, just as when we met, I on the left of Sappho, whose hands were stretched out. We received the influx, and then I noticed our positions, and complained that they were wrong; for I would have been divided, so that Sappho in departing took of my left side. I left my love with her, but my strength belonged to God. “This I explained to Acheirah, but he told me my idea was wrong, and that we were so divided that I might receive the influx of strength, and she that of mercy. “So we returned into the temple, conversing, I saying to her: ‘Enter with me the temple of the living God!’ “This she did, following me, and then knelt down at the altar, and waving a censer adored the Lord of the Universe. “After this was at an end, we clasped our hands (1°=10° grip), kissed, and parted; she promising me that she would dwell in the temple sometimes, and hover about me, and watch me work, and aid me when I called her. “Then I knelt before the altar, in adoration of the Lord of the Universe; but watched her upward and eastward flight, whilst she looked amorously back at me over her right shoulder, waving her hand to me. Once only did I call her, and then, once again turning to the Lord of the Universe with the sign of the Qabalistic Cross, returned to the body.” Such are some of the early visions of Frater P. They commence as we see in a series of rapidly changing and for the most part unconnected pictures, flying past the observer as the houses of a town seen through the windows of a quickly moving train. The streets which connect them are not noticed,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 318 neither always the entire buildings themselves, nor the ground on which then stand, nor the substance of which they are built; and to one who had not travelled in a train before, say a bushman who never wandered far from his native kraal, wonder and astonishment would be his as he watched the extraordinary disorder of the fast-flying view. At first he might be excused if he actually doubted his senses, so sud-denly do the apparently moving buildings come, change and vanish— now a roof, some chimneys—then a gap—a tree—a spire—a glimpse down a long street—it is gone; now a high bank—a cutting—a tunnel and darkness; and then once again the light and the continual whirling past of countless houses. Yet the city clerk does not wonder; for he knows well enough—too well ever to notice it—that the houses he is speeding by are built of brick and mortar, constructed on geometric and architectural plans, connected by streets and roads, by gas and water pipes, and by drains; each a microcosm in itself, regulated, ruled and ordered by codes, customs and laws, an organized unit only wanting the breath of life for it to rise up complete, and like some colossal giant stride away from before our terror- stricken eyes. Similarly, the adept will see in these visions a great ordered kingdom, and behind all their apparent chaos rule and law; for he will understand that the sudden changing, the leaping from blue seas to silver temples, and the rushing past fiery pillars, people worshipping, red garments, hawks; and then square pillars, an eye, or a flock of eagles, is not due to dis-order in the realm of the vision, but to the want of paraphrase in the mind of the beholder when he, on his return, attempts to interpret what he has seen in rational symbols and words."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 319 A chain of thought is simply a series of vibrations arising from the contact of a sense with a symbol or a series of symbols. “If controlled by the Reasoning Power, and licensed by the Will, such vibrations will be balanced and of equal length. But if uncontrolled by the Lower Will and the Reason they will be unbalanced and inharmonious --- that is, of uneven length.” This we find explained in a G∴ D∴ manuscript entitled: “The Secret Wisdom of the Lesser World, or Microcosm which is Man.” Further we learn form this manuscript that: In the case of the drunkard, the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensations, and consequently of the Nephesch, is disturbed, and the Thought Rays in consequence are shaken at each vibration; so that the sphere of the sensation of the Nephesch is caused to rock and waver at the extremities of the Physical Body, where the Ruach's action is bounded. The thought therefore is dazzled by the Symbols of the Sphere of Sensations in the same way as the eye may be dazzled in front of a mirror if the latter be shaken or waved. The sensation, therefore, then conveyed by the thought is that of the Sphere of sensations oscillating and almost revolving about the physical body, that which translated to the physical body bringeth giddiness, sickness, vertigo, and loss of idea, of place, and position. The fault as we see therefore lies in the preponderance of the Nephesch over the Ruach, in other words, the Emotion outbalancing the Reason. In the last vision, No. 18, we find more exertion on the part of the Ruach than in any of the others, and this is un-doubtedly accounted for by the fact that P., in this vision, set out with a definite object before him, namely, to see Sappho. The same might be said of Vision No. 7, but on consideration this will be found not to be the case, for, in No. 7, P. asks for strength to help his cousin, the very asking of which points to weakness; besides it is to be expected that a concrete idea will"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 320 take a much more definite form than an abstract one. In the former case when Sappho has once appeared, except for a break here and there, the vision is rational enough—if we can use so bastard a term to express ourselves in; not so the latter, which is particularly vague. In considering these visions and future ones, it must be remembered that through we now insist on a continuous chain of ideas as proof of their validity, and equally so with such as we may deal with later on, we at present find, above all else, that simplicity is our most certain guide; for we are as yet solely dealing with the visions of a student, who, as such, like a school-boy, is expected to work out all his visions in full as if they were mathematical problems. The master may use algebraical and logarithmic short cuts, if he likes, in the solution of his intricate problems, and we shall also find many of these masterly rights of way are quite as baffling, I am afraid, as the curious mistaken byways of the beginner. Further, it must ever be borne in mind that the deeper we dive into the occult sciences, although the simpler our language often becomes, the less we find our ability to express ourselves in mere words and ordinary phrases; from complex terms we sink to simple paradoxes, and from philosophic and scientific symbols we rise into a land of purely linguistic heiroglyphics—and thence silence. The task of consciously classifying and interpreting the phenomena in the Spirit Vision (in contradistinction to optical vision) is one of the chief duties undertaken by the Adeptus Minor, that is to say, of an individual who has passed through the grade of 5°=6°. P. had not as yet accomplished this. And in another part of the manuscript already referred to it is"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 321 entitled “The Task undertaken by the Adeptus Minor,” and is lucidly summarized as follows: This then is the task undertaken by the Adeptus Minor: To expel from the Sephiroth of the Nephesch the usurpation of the Evil Sephiroth. To equally balance the action of the Sephiroth of the Ruach and those of the Nephesch. To prevent the Lower Will and Human Consciousness from falling into and usurping the place of the Automatic Consciousness. To render the King of the Body (the Lower Will) obedient and anxious to execute the commands of the Higher Will; so that he be neither a usurper of the faculties of the Higher, nor a Sensual Despot, but an initiated ruler and an anointed King, the Vice-Roy and representative of the Higher Will (because inspired thereby in his Kingdom which is the Man). Then shall it happen that the Higher Will, i.e., the Lower Genius, shall descend into the Royal Habitation, so that the Higher Will and the Lower Will shall be as one, and the Higher Genius shall descend into the Kether of the Man, bringing with him the tremendous illumination of his Angelic Nature; and the man shall become what was said of Enoch: “And Chanokh made himself to walk for ever close with the essence of the Elohim, and he existed not apart, seeing that the Elohim took possession of his being.” . . . . . . . This is also a great mystery which the Adeptus Minor must know: How the Spiritual Consciousness can act around and beyond the Sphere of Sensation. “Thought” is a mighty force when projected with all the strength of the Lower Will, under the Guidance of the Reasoning Faculty, and illuminated by the Higher Will. Therefore, it is, that in thine occult working thou art advised to invoke the Divine and Angelic Names, so that thy Lower Will may willingly receive the influx of the Higher Will, which is also the Lower Genius, behind which are all potent forces. This, therefore, is the magical manner of operation of the initiate, when “Skrying in the Spirit Vision.” He knowing thoroughly through his Arcane Wisdom the disposition and correspon-dences of the Force of the Microcosmus, selecting not any, but a certain symbol and that balanced with its correlatives, then sendeth he, as before said, a Thought-Ray from his Spiritual Consciousness, illuminated by his Higher Will, directly unto the part of his Sphere of Sensation or M. M. of the U.* which is consonant with the symbol employed. There, as in a mirror, doth he perceive its properties as reflected from the Macrocosmus shining forth into the Infinite Abyss of the Heavens; thence can he follow the Ray of * Magical mirror of the Universe."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 322 Reflection therefrom, and while concentrating his united consciousness at that point of his Sphere of Sensation, can receive the Direct reflection of the Ray from the Macrocosmus. But if instead of concentrating at that actual point of the Sphere of Sensation, and thus receiving the Direct Ray, as then reflected into his thought, and uniting himself with the Ray of his thought, so as to make one continuous ray from the corresponding point of the Macrocosmus unto the centre of his consciousness: if instead of this he shall retain the thought-ray only touching the Sphere of Sensation at that point, he shall, it is true, perceive the reflection of the Macrocosmic ray, answering to that symbol in the Sphere of his consciousness; but he shall receive this reflection, tinctured much by his own nature; and therefore to an extent untrue. Because his united consciousnesses have not been able to focus along the thought-ray at the circumference of the Sphere of Sensation or M. M. of the U. And this is the reason why there are so many and multifarious errors in untrained Spirit Visions: for the untrained Skryer (i.e., Seer)—even supposing him free from the delusions of Obsession,* doth not know or understand how to unite his consciousness: still less what are the correspondences and harmonies between his Sphere of Sensation and the Universe—the Macrocosmus. . . . The Art of Skrying is further explained in a G∴ D∴ manuscript entitled “Of Travelling in the Spirit Vision,” in which this particular form of gaining contact, so to speak, with the Higher Will is explained as follows: The symbol, place, direction or plane being known whereon it is desired to act, a thought-ray is sent unto the corresponding part of the Sphere of Sensations, and thence by drawing a basis of action from the refined Astral Light of the Sphere of Sensations of the Nephesch, the thought-ray is sent like an arrow from a bow right through the circumference of the Sphere of Sensations direct into the place desired. Arriving here a Sphere of Astral Light is formed by the agency of the Lower Will illuminated by the Higher Will, and, acting through the Spiritual Consciousness, by reflection along the thought-ray, the Sphere of Astral Light is partly drawn from the Nephesch, and partly from the surrounding atmosphere. This Sphere being formed, a Simulacrum of the person of the Skryer is reflected into it along the thought-ray, and the united consciousness is then projected therein. This sphere is therefore a duplicate reflection of the Sphere of Sensations. As it is said: “Believe thyself to be in a place, and thou art there.” In this Astral projection, however, a certain part of the consciousness must remain * Or a cutting off of the Higher from the Lower Will."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 323 in the body to protect the thought-ray beyond the limits of the Sphere of Sensations (as well as the Sphere itself at that point of departure of the thought-ray) from attack by any hostile force, so that the Consciousness in this Projection is not quite so strong as the consciousness when concentrated in the natural body in ordinary life. The return taketh place by a reversal of this process; and, save to persons whose Nephesch and physical body are exceptionally strong and healthy, the whole operation of “skrying” and travelling in the Spirit Vision is, of course, fatiguing. Also there is another mode of Astral Projection, which can be used by the more practised and advanced Adept. This consisteth in forming first a Sphere from his own Sphere of Sensations, casting his reflection therein, and then projecting this whole Sphere to the desired place as in the previous method. But this is not easy to be done by any but the practised operator. In fact if this projection of the Sphere to the desired place can be carried out successfully, the highest illumination may be obtained thereby, supposing the desired place to be God or Kether. To a beginner this particular method of Attainment will appear very vague and unbalanced, for his astral journeys will consist of a chain of alarms and surprises; and the reason for this is that in almost every case he sets out with no clear idea of the place he is struggling to journey to, or the route he has chosen to adopt. He is like an explorer who sets out on a journey of discovery; the further he travels from his own native land, the more strange and uncommon do the lands appear to him through which he is journeying. Little by little the language of his country changes, melting as it were into another not unlike it but yet different; this in time also changes, and so by degrees do all his surroundings, until he finds himself in a strange country, as different from the one from which he started as an equatorial forest is from the ice-incrusted lands of the Pole. Sometimes the change of scenery is slight, sometimes vast,"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 324 according to the powers of attainment, but in all cases these journeys would be of little use unless method were brought into the extraordinary chaos which they at first reveal. And, as in Geography, little information could be obtained of the configuration of the Earth's surface unless explorers set out with a definite object in view, such as Columbus had when he set out on his great journey of discovery, and equipped with definite instruments; so in these Astral journeys, little or no spiritual information can be obtained unless the Skryer project, or at least set out with the intention of projecting, his Sphere to a certain and definite place. This, when applied to travelling to certain paths or places on the Tree of Life, is termed Rising on the Planes, and may lead, as above stated, should the place desired to arrive at be Kether, to the very highest Attainment. This Rising on the Planes is a definite mystical process, and two initiates setting out to attain the same goal would find the journey, in its essentials, as similar as two ordinary individuals would find a journey from London to Paris. Karma and environment have in these Risings on the Planes to be reckoned with, just as they would have to be taken into account in the case of the two men journeying to Paris. The one might be travelling third class, and the other first; the one might be travelling by a slow train, the other by an express; the one might see great beauty in the journey, the other little; yet both would know when they got to Dover, both would know when they were on the Channel, and both would in some way, different in detail through it might be, recognise Paris as Paris when they arrived at their destination."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 325 This particular method of Rising on the Planes is an exceptionally interesting one to study, not only because it is most intimately connected with the Eastern methods of Yoga,* but because we have many practical results to hand, many actual facts from which we can generalise and construct a theory. Two of such examples we will give here, the first a poem by Mr. Aleister Crowley called “The Ladder,” in which the projection is vertical, that is to say, directed along the central column of the Tree of Life; and in the second, which is called “The Ascent unto Daäh,” by V. H. Frater I. A. In the first of these “Risings” the goal of attainment is Kether, and the various headings of the poem point out clearly enough the different stages the Skryer has to pass through. From the darkness of Malkuth he passes the various symbolic colours, which will be discussed in a future chapter, as well as many of the symbols we have described, to arrive eventually at Kether. In the second, Fra. I. A. leads us as far as Daäth, the head of the Old Serpent, the Knower of Good and of Evil. * The whole theory and practice of Raja Yoga is the awakening of a power named the Kundalini, which is coiled up in what is called the sacral plexus, and then forcing this awakened power up a canal called the Sushumna, which runs through the centre of the spinal column. “When the Kundalini is aroused, and enters the canal of the Sushumna, all the perceptions are in the mental space or Chittakasa. When it has reached that end of the canal which opens out into the brain, the objectless perception is in the knowledge space, or Chidakasa.” As in the Ascent of the Central Column of the Tree of Life, there are certain centres, such as Malkuth, the Path of Tau, Yesod, the Path of Samech, Tiphereth, the Path of Gimel, Daäth, and Kether; so in the Sushumna are there certain centres or Chakkras, viz., Muladhara, Svadistthana, Manipura, Anahaba, Visuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasara.

Walk up! and see the marvellous mermaid! Only four sous!” It was at the Gingerbread Fair of Neuilly, and the showman was a squat little fellow, ridiculously like the gingerbread figures which his neighbour was selling, and from which the Fair derives its name. I admit I did not expect to see a mermaid, but I was tired of peep-shows and waxworks and fasting men, and there was something so incongruous in the idea of a mermaid, even an imaginary one, being exhibited in this rickety booth, by the light of a naphtha lamp, that, for a moment, I stopped to listen. The man stood in the doorway, shouting, to attract the passerby, and there was a picture too, to aid him: the picture of a wondrous creature with flaxen hair and a hectic flush, and decked with a silvern tail. I listened to his patter. She must be a wonderful person, this mermaid: she could swim, she could eat, and, at times, she could even talk. She was as large as life, and, by all accounts, she was more than twice as natural. So, at length, I paid my twopence, and I saw—a seal!

For wherever seals are common, be it in our own northern islands or in further foreign lands, there will these mermaid legends be wrought around them. Only in Orkney or the Hebrides they are most easily garnered, for the language is our own language. One of the most beautiful of them, when told in full, is the tale of the Mermaid Wife. On a moonlight night, as an Orkney fisherman strolled by the sea-shore, he saw, to his amazement, some beautiful maidens dancing a saraband on the smooth beach. In a heap by their side lay a bundle of skins, which, on his approach, the maidens seized and then plunged with them into the surf, where they took the form of seals. But the fisherman had managed to snatch up one skin, which lay apart from the rest, and so one maiden was left behind. Despite her entreaties and her tears, he kept the skin, and she was at last obliged to follow him to his hut. They married and had many children, who were like all other children, except for a thin web between their fingers, and for years husband and wife lived at peace. But every ninth night she would steal down to the beach and talk with one large seal in an unknown tongue, and then return with saddened countenance. And so the years passed, until one day, whilst playing in the barn, one of the children found an old dried skin. He took this to his mother gleefully, and she, snatching it from him, kissed him and his brothers and sisters, and then rushed down to the sea. And the fisherman, when he returned home that evening, was just in time to see his wife take the form of a seal and dive into the water. He never saw her again, but sometimes she would call o'nights, as"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"AMONGST THE MERMAIDS 339 she sported on the shore with her first husband, who was, of course, the large seal. That is the story as they tell it to-day in Orkney, and that is the story as told by Haroun al Raschid. Only, in the “Arabian Nights” it is called the “The Melancholy Youth,” and the seal is replaced by a dove, but all the essentials—the maidens, the bathing, the skins, the wedding, the flight—remain as they do to-day. The seal is well known to be an animal in which the maternal instinct is abnormally developed, and many of the tales have this fact as their basis. Here is a particularly charming one—the story of Gioga’s son: One day, as a boat’s crew were completing a successful raid on the seals, a great storm came on, and one of the party, who had become separated from the rest, was unavoidably left behind on the Skerry. The waves were dashing against the low rocks, and the unfortunate man had resigned himself to his fate, when he saw several of the surviving seals approaching. The moment they landed they threw off their skins, and appeared before him as Sea-trows or Seal-folk. And even those seals who had lately been skinned by the boat-men also revived in time, and took their human form, but they mourned the loss of their sea-vestures, which would for ever prevent them from returning to their homes beneath the ocean. Most of all did they lament for the son of Gioga, their queen. He, too, had lost his skin, and would be banished for ever from his mother's kingdom. But, seeing the forsaken boatman, who sat watching the rising waters in despair, Gioga suddenly conceived a plan to retain her son. She would carry the man on her back to the mainland, if he,"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 340 in his turn, would restore the missing skin. She even consented to his cutting some gashes in her flanks and shoulders that he might more easily retain his hold; so the mariner, leaving his perilous position, started on his scarcely less perilous voyage through the storm. But at length Gioga landed him safely, and he, for his part, kept the bargain and restored the skin of her son, so that there was great rejoicing on the Skerry that night. There is one other story of particular interest, in that it contains features not generally found amongst the bulk of the Seal-folk legends. It is the story of the Wounded Seal. There was once an islander who made his living by the killing of seals. One night, as he sat by the fire, resting after his day's work, he heard a knocking at the door, and, on opening it, found a man on horseback. The stranger explained that he had come on behalf of one who wished to buy a large number of skins, and then told him to mount up behind. Hoping to effect a good sale, the seal-hunter obeyed, and was carried away at a wild gallop, which ended on the brink of a precipice. There his strange companion grasped him, and plunged with him into the sea. Down they went, and down, till at length they reached the abode of the Seal-folk. Here, after a not unfriendly reception, the hunter was shown a huge jack-knife. It was his own—one which, that very morning, he had left in the back of a seal, and this seal, so he learned, was the father of the horseman. He was then taken to an inner cavern, where the wounded creature lay, and was requested to touch the wound. This he did, and the seal was forthwith cured. Great rejoicings followed, and the hunter was given a safe conduct home, after swearing never"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"AMONGST THE MERMAIDS 341 to slay a seal again. The return was effected in the same way as the previous journey, and the horseman, on his departure, left sufficient gold to compensate the islander for the loss of his means of livelihood. This story is the only one out of the scores told to me in which the seal may be said to take the offensive, and I cannot trace it to any foreign source. Mr. Walter Traill Dennison in his “Orcadian Sketches” tells us that the seal held a far higher place among the Northmen than any of the lower animals. He had a mysterious connection with the human race, and had the power of assuming the human form and faculties, and every true descendant of the Vikings looks upon the seal as a kind of second cousin in disgrace. Old beliefs die hard, and, in illustration of this, the following paragraph from a Scottish daily newspaper may be appropriately given: A MERMAID ON AN ORKNEY ISLE.—A strange story of the mermaid comes from Birsay, Orkney. The other day a farmer's wife was down at the seashore there, and observed a strange marine animal on the rocks. When she returned with her better half, they both saw the animal clambering amongst the rocks, about four feet of it being above water. The woman, who had a splendid view of it, describes it as a “good-looking person,” while the man says it was “a woman covered over with brown hair.” At last the couple tried to get hold of it, when it took a header into the sea and disappeared. The man is confident he has seen the fabled mermaid, but people in the district are of opinion that the animal must belong to the seal tribe. An animal of similar description was seen by several people at Deerness two years ago. Mr. Dennison, in the above-mentioned book, only touches on seals once, but the story he gives is new to me and I have translated it and curtailed it from the Orcadian dialect. I wonder if the old Norseman who told it had ever heard of Androcles?"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 342 THE SELKIE THAT DEUD NO’ FORGET A long time ago, one Mansie Meur was gathering limpets at the ebb tide, off Hackness, when he heard a strange sound coming from the rocks some distance off. Sometimes it would be like the sob of a woman, and sometimes louder, like the cry of a dying cow, but it was always a most pitiful sound. For a while Mansie could see nothing except a big seal close in to the rocks, who was craning his neck above the surface, and peering at a creek some distance off. And Mansie noticed that the seal was not frightened and never ducked his head once, but gazed continually at that creek. So Mansie crossed an intervening rock, and there, in a crevice, he saw a mother-seal lying in labour. And it was she who was moaning, whilst the father-seal lay out in the water watching her. Mansie stayed and watched her too, and after a while, she gave birth to two fine seal-calves, who were no sooner on the rocks than they clutched at their mother. Mansie thought to himself that the calf-hides would make a nice waistcoat, so he ran forward, and the seal-mother rowed herself over the face of the rock with her fins into the sea, but the two young ones had not the wit to flee. So Mansie seized them both, and the distress of the mother was terrible to see. She swam about and about, and beat herself with her fins like one dis-tracted; and then she would clamber up, with her fore-fins on the edge of the rock, and glower into Mansie's face. He turned to go off with the two young ones under his arm— they were sucking at his coat the while—when the mother gave such a cry of despair, so human, so desolate, that it went straight to Mansie's heart, and turning again, he saw the"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"AMONGST THE MERMAIDS 343 mother lying on her side with her head on the rock, and the tears were streaming from her eyes. So he stopped down and placed the little selkies near her, and the mother clasped them to her bosom with her megs and then she looked up into Mansie's face, and all the happiness in the world was in that look: for on that day the selkie did everything but speak. Mansie was a young man then, and sometime afterwards he married and settled on the west of Eday. One evening when he was fishing for sillocks on an ebb-rock, which could only be reached dry-shod at low water, the fish took unusually well, so that he stood and filled his basket. Indeed they took so well that he forgot all about the tide, and soon found himself cut off from the land. Mansie shouted and shouted, but he was far from any house, and nobody heard him. The water rose until it reached his knees, and then his hips, and then his shoulders. He shouted until he was hoarse, and then gave up all hope of life. But just as the sea was encircling his neck and coming now and then in little ripples to his mouth, just as the sea had almost lifted him from his rock, he felt something grip him by the collar of his coat, and in a few moments he found himself in shallow water. Looking round, he saw a big seal swimming to the rock, where she dived, picked up his basket of fish, and then swam back to the land. He took the basket from her mouth and then said with all his heart, “Geud bless the selkie that deus no’ forget,” for it was the same seal which he had seen on Hackness forty years before. She was a very old seal now but Mansie would have known her motherly face amongst a thousand. In the folklore of the Hebrides, also, the seal occupies a"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 344 prominent place. Not only has a certain mystery been woven into his life, but even in death his carcass has been accredited with various magical properties. The Highland Monthly for November 1892 contained an article dealing with this subject, by Mr. William Mackenzie, Secretary to the Crofter's Commission. That the skin, after being dried, should sometimes have been made into waistcoats, is only natural, but it appears that it was also put to a more esoteric use, for persons suffering from sciatica wore girdles of it, with a view to driving that malady away. The smoker and chewer, Mr. Mackenzie tells us, cut the skin into small squares, and converted them into spleuchain, or tobacco pouches, whilst the husbandman made thongs, which he used for the harness of his primitive plough. Seal oil was also thought to possess medicinal virtues of no mean order, and, until quite recently, a course of oal-roin was a favourite, if not a never-failing, specific for all chest diseases. Furthermore, it is asserted by Martin (circa 1695) that seal liver, pulverised and taken with aqua vitae, or red wine, is a good prescription for diarrhoetic disorders. Seal oil was used for lighting purposes in the monasteries, as the skins were for clothing, and from the pages of Adamnan we learn that the monks of Iona, in the time of St. Columba, had their own seal preserve. The animal was also very popular as an article of food. The natives of the Western Islands, says Martin, used to salt the flesh of seals with burnt seaware. This flesh was eaten by the common people in the spring-time “with a pointed long stick instead of a fork, to prevent the strong smell which"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"AMONGST THE MERMAIDS 345 their hands would otherwise have for several hours afterwards.” Persons of quality made hams of the seal flesh, and broth, made from the young seals, served the same purpose medicinally, but in a minor degree, as seal oil. In Roman Catholic districts the common people ate seals in Lent, on the ground that they were fish and not flesh! Annual raids were made on the seals after dark, usually in the autumn, and large numbers were captured. All, however, did not belong to the captors, for other persons of prominence were entitled to a share. The parish minister, according to Martin, “hath his choice of all the young seals, and that which he takes is called by the natives Cullen-Rory, that is, the Virgin Mary’s seal. The Steward of the Island hath one paid to him, his Officer hath another; and this by virtue of their offices.” In the Hebrides, as in Orkney, the seal is regarded not as an animal of the ordinary brute creation, but as one endowed with great wisdom, and closely allied to man. One of the old beliefs is that seals are human beings under magic spells. The seal was credited with being able to assume human form. While in human guise, he contracted marriages with human beings, and if we are to credit tradition, the Mac-Codrums of North Uist are the offspring of such a union. In former times the MacCodrums were known in the Western Islands as Sliechd nan Ron, or the offspring of the seals. As a seal could assume the form of a man and make his abode on land, so a MacCodrum could assume the form of a seal and betake himself to the sea! While in this guise we are told that several MacCodrums had met their death."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 346 There is one local story which stands out from the rest, in that it contains a song by the animal: A band of North Uist men slaughtered a number of seals on the Heisker rocks, and brought them to the main island. They were spread out in a row on the strand. One of the party was left in charge of them over night. To vary the monotony of his vigil he wandered a little distance away from the row of dead seals. When sitting under the shelter of a rock he beheld coming from the sea a woman of surpassing beauty, with her rich yellow tresses falling over her shoulders. She was dressed in an emerald robe, and, proceeding to the spot where the dead seals lay, she identified each as she went along soliloquising as follows: Speg Spaidrig, Spog mo chulein chaoin chaidrich, Spog Fhienngala, Speg me ghille fada fienna—gheala, ’S minig a bheis a’greim de rudain, A Mhic Unhdainn, ’ic Amhdainn, Speg a ghille mhoir ruaidh ’S olc a rinn an fhaire ’n raeir.

Although tales about sea-trows and mermaids are still plentiful in the islands of Orkney, the land fairies are acknow-ledged to have departed for ever. This is the story of their departure as it has been pieced together by Mr. R. Menzies Fergusson. Once upon a time, many years ago, the trows became dissatisfied with their residence upon Pomona. They determined, therefore, to leave the Pomona hills and knowes, and take up their dwelling beside the Dwarfie Stone on the island of Hoy. The change was to be effected one evening at midnight, when the moon would be full and everything in favour of their flitting. The fateful night arrived, and the fairy train set out upon their journey. They bade farewell to the grassy hillocks upon which they had danced so often, and to the rocky caverns, the scene of their nightly revels, and all hied to the trysting-place, which was the Black Craig of Stromness, chanting an elfin song as then went. There they made the preparations necessary for crossing the intervening sea. They took a number of “simmons,” or straw bands used in thatching houses, and, tying them together, made a long rope of sufficient length to stretch across the sound. One end was fastened to the top of the Black Craig, and a sentinel was told off to watch that it did not slip. The other end was seized by a long-legged trow called “Hempie,” the “Ferry- leuper,” who made an enormous leap"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 348 and alighted upon the opposite shore. There he secured his end of the straw bridge and made ready to receive his fellow trows as they crossed. At length a start was made and all the trows were soon upon the rope, but just as they reached the middle, he who was in charge at the Stromness end let go his hold, and the whole company of fairies were thrown into the sea, dragging Hempie along with them in their descent. And the sea, being rough at the time, overwhelmed them all, so that every one was drowned. When he who had caused the calamity saw what had occurred, he too plunged into the angry water, so as not to survive his friends, and thus perished with them. For a few moments a solitary figure appeared upon one of the rocks. It was the Dwarf of Hey. He gazed at the scene of the catastrophe, chanted a fairy dirge, and then vanished for ever. Such was the end of the land-trows, and, although it put a stop to the making of further fairy-stories, it opened up a new hunting-ground for the weaver of romances in the caves beneath the sea. And even where there is no definite tale or detailed legend to tell beside the inglenook, there is sure to be some quaint conceit of metempsychosis which they can whisper when a seal comes near them. Was not Pharaoh's army turned into a school of seals? And that great white seal, which the fishermen have seen, and whose track is like the wash of an ocean steamer, is that not Pharaoh himself? So the stories spread, and the passer-by may take his fill of them, but I, for one, like best of all the tale of Gioga's son. And if just one passer-by on hearing it is held from firing just one shot, the tale has not been told in vain."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"AMONGST THE MERMAIDS 349 But if ever I see that great white seal, whose track is like the wash of an ocean steamer, I am not quite sure but that I might rise a gun myself.

How was I to escape? There was certainly not the slightest doubt that the man was a lunatic. Now, as it happens, lunatics have always been exceedingly interesting to me. Here was a case for my curiosity. This fellow, thought I, must have deceived the vigilance of his guardians, and I shall find no difficulty in having him arrested at the railway station, or at least on our arrival at Brighton. So I followed him. At the turning a big motor-car was waiting, and two men stood by on the pavement. They bowed silently before my companion, and made me enter the car. One of them took charge of the driving, and the other followed us two in the back seats. The man said but one word, “Scat,” and we started at a terrific speed and were soon off on the road. I began to feel uneasy; but prudence stopped my speech in time, and the man next to me began to titter. Then he spoke; and though he may have uttered different words, this is what I understood: “You are trying to deceive us. I always notice such an attempt, even when it has only reached its mental stage. Indeed, I cannot help noticing it. No doubt you have heard of me; I am the-man-whose-nose-sings-at-will. That power has been granted me ever since I felt a strong impulse to kill my"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 360 wife with an axe. I mastered my impulse, and by a triumph of my logical faculties I cut my own right arm. Having no arm, I could no more kill my wife with an axe. God rewarded me by giving me the power of reading thought, which constitutes an extra sense for me; and to my nose He gave a voice of its own. I was a dentist. Indeed, I have found a new way of extracting teeth without gas. You merely press the neck of your patient, who faints in consequence, and you can then safely operate. How did you come to this? What caused you to take the attire of a man in place of the usual brown coat of a cover?” His companion—friend or master—bade him keep silent for a while, and we journeyed in silence. When we came in sight of Brighton the motor-car stopped suddenly in front of a large gate. The moment after we entered a park, and the door being opened, I was taken into the house. The man whom, so unhappily for me, I had met in the street was now alone with me. Without leaving me a moment's peace, he began to take my measure with the utmost care and caution. Then, pointing to me a strong and broad cage, he ordered me to step in. It would be very tiresome and quite useless for me to express here my various thoughts and the miserable conster-nation into which I was thrown. I would not live those hours again for anything in the world, and had the devil been within my reach I should decidedly have given my soul to him in order that he should see me safely home. But no one came to my rescue, and, though most unwilling, I had to submit to my terrible fate."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"THE MAN-COVER 361 When the cage, made of the strongest steel, was closed upon me, I found myself a prisoner in the most degrading state. I began to look around and to shake the bars of my grating, but in vain. The man-without-a-cover had gone. My next step was to inspect the prison. And in so doing I discovered in the left corner a box, resembling a coffin in shape, though it was certainly not a coffin such as I delight in seeing daily in the windows of the undertakers. It was divided into compartments! “Is this the box of lofty thoughts, I wonder?” said I to myself. In that case the man must have had a certain degree of reason about him after all, for the box was far from being empty. In the first compartment was a red flower, blushing deeply with all the purest carmine of Nature. The flower was certainly not freshly cut, but had preserved all its beauties and delectable perfume. In the second compartment was a doll. Oh, not an extraordinary doll! A plain, common hand-made wooden doll, which you could open by the middle, to discover inside it a second doll presenting exactly the same appearance. Just like those figureless old women of white wood made by the Russian peasants during the long evenings of their winter season. From the first to the last there were twenty-one dolls, one inside the other. The last was scarcely bigger than a poppyseed, but presented exactly all the particularities of the largest one. In the third compartment were two books. You may judge of my surprise when I opened them and found that no"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 362 black stain polluted the immaculate white of their leaves. Only the binding bore some words. They were the titles of those unwritten books. Thus they ran: “The book which contains all that I know for certain.” “Advice to Mankind for a better use of their faculties.” No name of author was to be seen. In the fourth compartment was a little framed picture, and though I examined it very closely I was not able at first to realize what the subject of the picture was. From a shallow little boat a gigantic snake was seen to emerge, fiercely staring, and on the opposite corner was a round black spot. As, when a child throws a stone in a river, the waves extend farther and farther, shunning the bruises which the child has inflicted upon them, in a like manner waver of a grey lighter and lighter as they extended towards the snake were painted in methodically eccentric gyrations. The last wave was almost white, and stopped at the head of the monster. In the fifth compartment was a skull. In the sixth compartment was a white rose, with a delicious scent. In the seventh compartment, as well as in the eighth and last, I saw nothing, but a sweet music struck on my ear when I bent over them. The tunes were very different at first, one tender and soft, the other furious and thundering. At the end, however, both melted in a whisper, to die suddenly in a piercing cry of laughter."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"THE MAN-COVER 363 And the man-who-lost-his-cover came into the room again. “Well,” said he, “I thought that by now you would have found your way to submit to necessity and reintegrate your real personality. What did you see in my box?” I told him, and instantly he grew pale and staggered. But after a moment he looked furiously at me, and resumed his former manner. “By God!” he said, “I cannot believe you. How you have found out my secret and learned by heart the things which one ought to see in my box, but which one does not, I ignore. But you cannot possibly have seen them.” I swore that I was no impostor. But he refused to listen to me, and called his two men. They came, and began verifying the measure he had taken of me. “Too long,” said he, when it was completed. “You have grown out of shape. We shall have to cut out and plane you in order that you should exactly fit my mighty box. However, as you pretend to have seen in it things which a cover cannot possibly see, I must give myself a day to think it over.” I felt instantly relieved, and began to hope again. “Perhaps I shall not be cut out and planed after all,” thought I; and smiled humorously upon the man. Fool! I felt almost certain that a crueller punishment could not be conceived by the morbid imagination of a mad-man.

I should raise no sympathy in your heart by whimpering over myself. It is true that I am inclined to run riot in self-lamentations; but great men always are. And I shall try henceforth not to give way to that unwholesome tendency. I have much already to be forgiven. In my cage, then, to resume, I was just passing from a state of dreadful mental agony to a more settled and hopeful disposition. For the second time the man-who-had-lost-his-cover left me alone; and I felt more relieved. He will never dare, thought I; and, after all, he does not look such a cold-blooded murderer. His eyes indicate some sort of inner life and his tone and voice are gentle at times. It is a joke, a mystification. . . . It must be. Thus I tried to deceive myself, and I must admit that I utterly failed. Looking, then, around my prison, I began to feel a very peculiar sort of numbness coming over me. It was almost like intoxication, and I am not in the least ashamed to say that I know what intoxication is. I was drowsy; my head seemed to weigh as heavy as if it contained lead in place of the keenest brains. The coffin appeared to me a most comfortable bedstead, and the skull a soft pillow. A horrible attraction bent me towards the box, and in a moment I lay, stiff, snoring, over the eight compartments. There is here a blank in my memory. Under the influence of a powerful narcotic, I was cut out and planed to fit the coffin exactly.

This is my way of explaining it, but of course it is a mere suggestion. It might have been an airship that took me away, independent of terrestrial laws, regardless of Customs Duties—who knows, perhaps hovering over London and Scotland Yard and my dear old house in which I was so happy —but . . . Nec scire fas est omnia. The only thing I am certain of is that I was either planed to fit the coffin, or the coffin to fit me; and then I woke up. I was on board a sea-or air-ship. Believe me, she was in great danger. However, this would prove a useless narrative. The floating machinery suffered, was nearly wrecked; the crew suffered, nearly perished; I suffered, and nearly died. After the storm was over I found myself on the shore of this island with the box; a small cage out of which two carrier-pigeons, almost dead with hunger, were struggling to escape; three sailors of the crew; the man-whose-nose-sings-at-will, and a dog; while my tormentor and the other souls were drowned, I suppose, or thrown upon some other land. It seems now almost as if I should wish my tormentor to be here. I might cure him; and at all events he would be compelled by necessity to adopt a more lenient attitude towards me.

Here takes place an incoherent discussion on the bitter taste of sea-water and the possibilities of its sweetening, after which the MS. comes to an end. I have sent back the pigeon, and expect to receive a new supply of facts—more precise than the vague and uncanny allegations contained in the first.

However, the MS. is human, and so . . . imprimatur!"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":" 366 II CONSIDERING the bulk of the MSS. trusted to the carrier-pigeon by my correspondent, I decided to send an extra porter with the first bird, in case of the next message being of an equal or superior volume, and as I know something about pigeons, as before mentioned, I managed that in a very clever way. I say clever because it is a very simple scheme in its cleverness, and nobody would say it if not I, but nevertheless it had to be found—like the egg of the late C.C. I bought a fine hen pigeon, and kept it with the Man-Cover's messenger, so that they could rub acquaintance. When I noticed the first symptoms of love I bless the new pair and let them go. The new wife—as I thought she would—followed her husband. They returned to me with the following strange document, and I think I must warn the reader against a certain feeling of sympathy towards the writer. The wickedness and cruelty with which he carries out his logical tendencies are too repulsive to permit any sentiment of pity. His sufferings appear to be simply the consequences of a wild and unhindered imagination, and the real victims—the only ones to be pitied—are his unhappy companions. That is, of course, in the case of the documents being an expression of reality. I am sure every one feels the necessity of clearing up this matter. Alas! there are no Radicals in this country—that is, persons acting in a radical manner—as I have written to the Man-cover himself and consequently I have little hope that H.M. Government will give any orders on the matter. I am afraid that if an expedition is sent over it will be commanded by some dis-tinguished foreign officer. However, should the expedition cover itself with ridicule by not finding the Man-Cover or his island, it is perhaps safer for the British reputation that it should be a foreign expedition.

Dean Swift and Samuel Butler stand, no one will deny it, as the greatest benefactors of humanity. If my sufferings could prove of any utility, in their turn, I should feel myself proud and most happy to describe at length the life I am now leading with three sailors, a dog, a musician, a box whose value I am learning every day to appreciate more and more, and our carrier-pigeons, in a distant island. I must begin methodically and give a systematic account of my life here. I trust that the Authority presiding over our destinies will look upon me as the most logical of all men. As the surroundings play an important part in our life, my first duty is to describe them. The island is a large one. When I have gone round it myself I shall perhaps be able to give a rough estimate of its area. For the present I can but say: it is a large island. We have trees by thousands: water trees, from which, after the stems have been cut and slashed, the water pours down; kola-nut trees, papaw tress, with their flowers, male and female; dragon trees, fig trees, cocoa-nut palms, bread-fruit trees, and the rest. Beautiful birds are dwelling in the branches. All that is needed for life is abundant and easy to gather.

No venomous or objectionable beast has yet dared to breathe the air of this balmy country. But it is not a deserted spot. The natives are black, but tame and pleasant, and one of my first steps will be to try and bring them into contact with the beauties of our civilisation. For this object the mighty box is of the utmost importance; and here I touch on the first difficulty which I encountered. The destiny of man being precarious and unsettled, my soul was often wandering at large in its anxiety to provide for the future of the lofty thoughts of my late tormentor. I had banished all hatred and bitterness from my heart and forgiven my enemy. He had done me a great wrong, dragging me pitilessly away from the peaceful occupations of my life, cutting and planing my worthy form in order that I should fit his coffin. He had driven me to his ship, and was the cause of my present exile. Two young kittens had placed all their hope in me, and I was failing to fill my paternal duty towards them. I was working at my great work, in fifty-two volumes, on the various elements composing the shell of the oyster, and I had almost completed my Introduction, when I was thus deprived of my liberty by the man-who-had-lost-his-cover. Yet I bore him no grudge. He was right; I feel it more intensely every day. A box so mighty needed a cover. In consequence, knowing that the hour of my death might strike at any moment, I had to find a man-cover to replace me in that event; one who would never forget to reintegrate the box every night. Proceeding in order, I looked around me; and at once"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"THE MAN-COVER 369 discarded the two pigeons and the dog. I had only to choose between the three sailors and the man-whose-nose-sings-at-will. As the latter was of great help to us, and kept the negroes amused for hours with the harmonious though plaintive accords springing at will from his nasal organ, there remained only the sailors. The natives, were, of course, totally unfit for such a fate. They could find no inner delectation in the perpetual sufferings occasioned by so dreadful an ordeal—or doom! Of the three sailors, one was much too short to prove of any use. If I could easily shorten, lop, prune, and curtail a too big substitute, I could not possibly add anything to that small pattern of our race. I decided, in consequence, to slay him, during his sleep, so that a useless impediment be done away with. As the four men, since the wreck of our ship, were sunk in a state of torpor and only stared at me with vacant looks, it proved easy to settle this slight matter. I removed the body; and left to time and the natural dryness of the air the care of dividing its various elements. The man-whose-nose-sings-at-will was the first to notice the absence of the sailor, but he said nothing to me. In fact, I believe him to be mad also. He is continually looking anxiously towards the east, and seems lost to this world, since his friend or master has disappeared in the wreck. From the middle of his face gushed a sad tune, and from his eyes many a bitter tear; but, as I said before, he addressed me not. I was not a little surprised, as he is the only one with me to know the secrets of the box. But I respected his silence. The two others were more suitable for my purpose. One was a strongly built fellow, with a certain air of intelligence"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 370 about him; but he was yet too besotted with fear or moral distress to be made the recipient of my plans. So I had only one expedient left to me, and turned all my faculties towards the last of my companions. He is not young by any means. His temples are already crowned with the grey silver of at least fifty years and his nose with the carmine of many gallons. But his remarkable acuteness renders him extremely valuable. When I opened my mind to him he simply lifted his eyes at me with a shrewd look and smiled gently with the smile of the Wise. I told him the story of the meeting with my kidnapper; and explained to him the operation I had to go through before I could fit the coffin of lofty thoughts. With the exception of the secret of the eight compartments, I opened my very soul to that worthy successor. He must possess a keen sense of humour; for he began gently, and dry-humour-like, telling me a quite different story. His smile, of course, showed that he was only trying to entertain me. According to his version, I am a well-known surgeon who had lost his reason and was taken to the private yacht of a celebrated alienist. As I seemed to be always talking of a coffin without a cover, one had been made of my size. Unhappily, says the sailor, a wreck happened; and the doctor who was to cure me has been drowned. This narrative caused me to laugh heartily. I could scarcely keep my ribs together. I had no trouble in pointing out to him the contradictions in his story, and he soon agreed with me. When he saw, moreover, that I alone of us all was armed, and that the natives treated me with great respect, he put himself entirely at my disposal. I took advantage of this"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"THE MAN-COVER 371 happy mood to offer him my services in order that he should be cut out and planed on the spot. But he looked gently in my eyes, and said that he himself would see to that. I told him of my experiments, and how I still had at times a certain illusion that my body was absolutely complete. But (he said) the case is common with all men amputated; and he promised me that in case of my death he should at once prepare himself to take my place at night on the top of the coffin. My mind being thus at rest, I began studying more deeply the contents of that mighty box."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":" 372 III THE two carrier-pigeons have come to me. I am glad to say they look very happy. Though there is still much to be published before we arrive at the part of the Man-Cover's adventures with which this last message is concerned, he informs me of such surprising news that I think it my duty to let the readers share it at once. The news is startling. Having received my letter, he threatens to blow the island into the air, should any vessel approach within three miles. He informs me of his absolute decision never to leave the place, and never to allow any one to come within the distance mentioned. Provided he receives my pledge never to reveal the situation of his new landed property, he promises to keep me informed of all his doings. For the sake of the tale, I have made myself an accomplice of his crimes and follies. I am ashamed of myself, but curiosity is stronger than shame. The carrier-pigeons have fled back to him with my word of honour. I was too anxious to know more about the Man-Cover, and my duty as a reporter has made me forget the moral ideas painfully inculcated unto me by a life of hard experience and severely-paid-for mistakes. Scratch the man, you will find the beast. I must admit this has proved true for me also. It is the last time that I let my own personality come between the readers and the wickedly mad hero of history, and I apologise for this intrusion. I now give place to him, and will publish his notes as I receive them. The contents of the coffin have not suffered from the wreck. Here they are all, the books and the skull, the roses white and red, the picture and the doll. From the seventh and eighth compartments sprang the same tunes.

When they were dry the two books came very handy to me. I opened them at the first page, and started putting down with a blue pencil the most important among all the thoughts that came into my brain. In “The book which contains all that I know for certain” I began with these sentences: “Your enemy, when his hatred and persecution lead you to a clearer perception of Life's secrets, becomes your benefactor.” “The men living in my company being unable to realise that my body is nothing but an illusion of their deficient sight, it is useless for me to try and oblige them to recognise it as a mere wood cover.” “Their error will appear even more plausible and explicable when one considers that a few days ago I was myself unaware of my real personality; and that I am still at times under the influence of insufficiently keen senses.” “The destiny of a Man-Cover being a case of exceptional scarcity, he cannot reasonably be bound by everyday morals and conventions. All that hampers him, all that comes in his way to prevent him from fulfilling his sacred duty, must be surmounted and overcome. What is crime in a man is often virtue in a cover.” Having thus established a sound and most solid base of"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 374 morality, which could be transmitted as a new gospel for the special use of the Men- Covers of future times, I opened the second book to put down in it some equally useful aphorisms. But as I took my pencil the white, immaculate page appeared covered with brown characters. I had scarcely time enough to read and they had vanished. But I remember what I saw. “You must leave the study of the oyster-shells in order to perceive the invisible, to refine your senses and escape the delusions caused by them.” “The duty of man is not to believe other men. They speak either truth or untruth; but if they speak truth, even then is it a falsehood.” “All men are not necessarily obliged to kill their opponents or those who doubt them, or who are not of any use to them; but some men are—all Men-Covers are.” I was interrupted in the profound meditation that followed this discovery by the approach of a strong party of natives. My heir-apparent, if I may be allowed to use that expression in regard to a Man-Cover, was absent; and our two other companions had also made themselves scarce. These black men seemed to be frenzied with pugnacity, a very unusual disposition. After rapidly taking advice of the skull (the two books failing on the matter), I lay down in my usual place, protecting the lofty thoughts from impure contact, resolved to be pierced through and through rather than to let these black devils brush the holy books. To be pierced through could not do me much harm; and the holes would soon be stopped up by the skilful hand of my worthy understudy. Evidently my attitude of passive resistance surprised the"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"THE MAN-COVER 375 natives. They gathered around me and began singing a strange mélopée. One of their chiefs passed his hands over my face, and I became at once unconscious. . . . When I awoke I was still covering the coffin, but the surroundings had changed. Over me was a huge canopy of magnificent trees in full bloom of youth. Nature had certainly not been helped in the forming of that beautiful corner of the world; nevertheless a Japanese gardener, master of his art, could not have done better. Two gaps at the foot of the coffin were apparently waiting for posts to be planted. Wild flowers of all colours, some of a shade quite unknown to me, perfumed the air. It was no more the sunny afternoon, but a morning splendid and enchanting. The dew covered the prairie, and it seemed as if the grass were weeping lukewarm tears. At intervals a gentle breeze came, softly caressing the head of each blade of grass, refreshing them with its breath. Then Father Sol moved also with sympathy, showed him- self a while before he was due, drying the tears of the green blades. It dried also my coffin, and from the musical compartments came the roulades of an invigorated voice. As I heard also the panting breath of the negroes, I looked for them, and saw that, quite unaware of the tune, they were sitting at a little distance, all talking at the same time, carolling and shouting. But they were not, I gather, plotting any serious mischief. They saluted me in a friendly manner when they saw me leave the box and walk towards them. I must have been a long time lying over it, a whole afternoon and night, maybe, during my unnatural sleep. I bowed gracefully before them; but they seemed amazed"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 376 at my forwardness. As I was going to address them an awful feeling passed over me. My old fancy took possession of my brains again, and I imagined myself made of flesh and bones. I began to suffer as if my body had in reality become stiff and benumbed. Happily it was enough for me to turn and see the coffin, and my delusion fled. Moreover, I noticed that I had forgotten one of the most important things. The very colour of the coffin ought to have told the truth to me long ago. Of course I was now of a dark brown complexion, almost black, and this was the reason of their surprise. A movement which I detected among them made me turn quickly towards my box. Too late, alas! The scoundrels had taken advantage of my few steps towards them, and were pillaging the coffin, keeper of lofty thoughts. The piercing cry I uttered perplexed them. One had already the skull in his hands, but on hearing me he put it back in the compartment instantly; and they all began chanting a slow prayer, which I could not understand. I went back straight to the box, and, kneeling over it, sought consolation in the sweet tune of the two last compartments. When I turned round again the miserable, unintelligent creatures had gone, all but two, who advanced towards me. They were women of a lovely type."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":" 377 IV I was a prisoner. An inextricable entanglement of tropical creepers encircled the little oasis. A small path had been managed, but it was severely guarded at the other end. What doom had been prepared for me? For what purpose had these two handsome creatures been left with me? I only reproduce here an infinitesimal part of the numberless thoughts which came to my mind in that moment. However—for this should prove a too long narrative—I soon ceased ruminating upon the future, for the women began singing a sort of cheerless lay. “How, fah, fah, how, loh, hew, hew,” it went on, and I could foresee no end to the romance. In the meantime the maidens advanced towards me, and while their thoughts gave way to the noise referred to already, their hands soon began gently scratching my head, as if to prey upon my hair. I have always been rather sensitive to feminine beauty, and when they leant gracefully over me and began patting my cheeks I thought how simply delightful it would be to desert my duties, abandon my coffin, and live as a man who is not a cover. I was soon to feel ashamed of this intention. After they had indulged in that little recreation they changed the tune of their lay and gave the same words with another air, which called at once to my mind the choir of the"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 378 “Suppliants.” As a matter of fact they were asking me for some favour. At the sight of real tears rolling down the faces of these two most lovable creatures, so handsome and graceful, so perfect in all their proportions, my pity was set in motion; and soon love was to follow, thought I. Though of a slightly dark complexion, they were none the less remarkably pretty, and very near the finest type of white womanhood. Alas! their beauty was a trap, their sweet voices were meant to delude me; the sirens had been sent by those who could not but mean persecution against me. I found this out as soon as I understood them. They wanted my flowers. With a supple and harmonious gesture, they suggested that I should let them have the mystical roses. As soon as I perceived their intentions I felt the most intense impulse to murder them. We talked for a long time without being able to gather much of each other's thoughts. At last I turned to the books in the coffin, and in the book containing “Advice to Mankind for a better use of their faculties” I saw, traced by an invisible hand, the following advice: “Be careful of womanly traps.” “Let the roses be planted; they are meant for that purpose.” “A cover cannot fall in love except with boards and planks. Beware of the fallacies of sense.” As any one may understand, my mind was a pandemonium, but still I could not refuse to submit to so clear an order, and I handed the roses to the maidens. I had not to repent the"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":" 379 concession. They clasped their hands and smiled upon me; then planted them instantly in the two big holes of which I have spoken already. The result was immediate. The plants began growing and growing, blossoming in many parts of their stalk, and their odour delighted my nostrils. But this meant no peace for me. The two females, truly, shrank from me, but my senses were speaking in a rough way. They sat at the other end of the oasis; and looked on with wide-open eyes of delight as the two sweet and scented plants continued to grow. I could not detach my sight from the girls, and for the first time my ear did not perceive the music of the two compartments. It seemed to me as if there were two personalities in me, one simple and natural, as it becomes a wood cover, the other complex and full of passions, as if I were really the man whom I knew to be no more. I took the skull in my hands, and suddenly a light broke its way into my soul. How could I be deluded this time? I had arms and hands; I “SAW” them. I saw the women, I saw the coffin. It was not the feeling of a plain piece of brown wood. I went almost mad over the discovery. What was the meaning of all this? I then opened the book again, but scarcely had I time to glance at the white page before a large band of negroes came again to me; and this time I could not keep them at a distance. They chained me and drove me away. I fell unconscious. At my awakening I found that I was alone by the shore with the old sailor, my willing successor. When he saw that I opened my eyes he spoke gently to me: “Are you better now?” “What has happened?” said I, instead of answering his question."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 380 “Oh you have been very ill for many days with brain-fever. You must not speak too much.” “What? Where is the coffin?” “The negroes have it; they have carried it away into the interior. But I suppose you are cured now?” he added in an anxious tone. I shall not repeat the conversation that ensued. Enough to mention that I discovered the old sailor to be absolutely mad. And being unable to persuade him that I was still firmly convinced of being the cover of the lost coffin, I found it better to agree with him. And soon he fell into the trap. Hiding the longing after my box and its contents, the doll and the skull and the mighty books, I spoke to him as if completely unconcerned about the loss, and unrolled a scheme for civilising the natives. He told me of a little hut under the canopy, where my two wives were waiting for my arrival, as soon as I could get up and walk there. He did not expect me to do so before a long while, but he was wrong. With a cautious look around me, I began creeping slowly towards him; and before he could call any one I had jumped at his throat. I had my idea; and being a logical man, I wanted to carry it out faithfully, without losing an instant. We struggled a long time; and, as I was getting exhausted, I succeeded at last in taking his knife, and sank it in his stomach. It was not very pleasant for me to see his blood running black and hot on the sand; but I had to perform this execu-tion, owing to his obstinacy. It was safer to destroy my understudy, as I had called him till then in my happy thoughts, and try afterwards to get another one to fill his place.

The two wives he had spoken of were the same women who caused my last illness. But their sweet smile prevented me from using any abusive language, which, in fact, they could not understand. Well aware that I was fated to conceal my thoughts for a very long while, I allowed them to advance and attend upon me. In that way began my new life as master of a harem. At first the negroes treated me with a certain reserve, even with hostility; but they soon changed, seeing me so tame and amiable.

This event helped me to recover the coffin, and I am glad to say that nothing had been done to it to spoil it. It had two hundred natives hanged, and as many burned alive, for form's sake, and in order to show their fellow black men that my justice was impartial; but apart from this unimportant little fact nothing followed the recovery of the mighty box.

F. C. Fuller's “Star in the West.” This work, however, more than these two, which only deal with Kant en passant, shows him to be, as we have always considered him, the wild Irish- man of Teutonic thought, who recklessly gallops at the philosophic hurdles set up by the seventeenth-century and early eighteenth-century philosophers. Some of these he clears skilfully enough, others he crashes through and shouts a priori, little seeing that these innate intuitions of his are but abstractions from experience—“inherited experiences,” as Herbert Spencer has since shown—without furthering the solution of the problem “What is Existence?” In fact, in many ways Kant may be said to be the eighteenth-century Spencer, and much more so than Spencer can be said to be the nineteenth-century Kant. He succeeded Berkeley and Hume, just as Spencer succeeded Hegel and Fichte; but, like the great transfigured realist, only ultimately and unconsciously to be overthrown by the very questions he fondly imagined he had explained away. Nevertheless he answered these questions so astutely that it has taken the whole of the nineteenth century to explain what he meant! This Major Kelly indirectly, if not directly, points out by attempting to rectify the Transcendental Æsthetics Analytic and Dialectic by the critical and idealistic pantheism of Schopenhauer. Interesting as this is, it would have indeed added further to the value of this little book had Major Kelly added a chapter dealing with the philosophy of Kant from to-day’s critical standpoint, instead of halting with Schopenhauer's extension of the same. Had he done so he would scarcely have asserted, as he does (or is it Kant or Schopenhauer?), that from the law of Causality results the important a priori corollary “that Matter can neither be created nor destroyed” (p. 35). If, however, it can be destroyed, as Gustave le Bon has attempted to prove, what becomes of the a priority of Causality? Nay, further, of the a priority of the Transcendental Æsthetic itself—of Time and of Space, the fundamental sensual perceptions of Kant's system? Must we agree with the learned author of “The Star in the West,” that Kant, after having for a hundred years lost his way in “the night of Hume's ignorance,” has at length fallen victim to his own verbosity, and has indeed sadly scorched “his fundamental basis” ?

Oswald K•lpe's work is of an essentially Teutonic character, having nearly all the characteristics, both good and bad, that one expects to find in a German technical scientific work; eminently typical is “Outlines of Psychology” in its thoroughness. The experimental method, in which Külpe is an adept, shows conclusively and absolutely the essential unity of body and mind. Psychology is still in its infancy; when it attains maturity it will be the most dread enemy that Supernaturalism has to face. The subjective view of life is undoubtedly destined to be the predominant one. Your reviewer ventures to prophesy that in the science whereof Külpe is a brilliant pioneer will be found the key to the ecstasy that is the Vision in all religions.

Professor Ziehen, the author of this useful little text-book—useful at least for examination purposes and “sixth-form” students in psychology—follows in the main the theories more widely known in this country through the works of Münsterberg, and rejects such of those of Wundt as are based by him upon that a priori auxiliary function, the so-called “apperception.” “From the outstart,” states Professor Ziehen, \"the conception 'unconscious psychical processes' is for us an empty conception\"; and so, on the strength of this assertion, he attempts to work out the whole of his argument empirically. This he does rationally enough, as we might expect from a professor of Jena; but in spite of the cunning of his logic and the lucidity of his numerous “becauses,” he, in the end, is as inconclusive as Wundt or any of the modern psychologists. Finally he explains nothing, or, to be charitable, very little, and in spite of this assertion, “Our thoughts are never voluntary,” we are still more in doubt as to this on closing his volume than we were upon opening it. Further, he writes on p. 247: “The freedom which we think to possess in the so-called voluntary processes of thought is only semblance.” In spite of the dogmatism displayed in this sentance, we almost agree with it, and would heartily do so if our worthy Professor had included in it all mental conditions explicable in the language of man. Semblances we feel they all are, semblances of a something beyond book or word, a something alone attainable by Titanic work. The individual, we feel, will never understand the minds of others until he understands his own.

So therefore Tennyson succumbed to contempt, not to hatred; men twitched their robes away from the contamination of the unclean thing—there was no fight, no bloodshed.

Since our expression 'common denominator' is used in a figurative and not in a strictly mathematical sense, the task is less complex than appears at first sight, and the 32 Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation of the Qabalah, provide a convenient scale. These 32 Paths are attributed by the Qabalists to the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations of Deity, and to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are again subdivided into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters. On this basis, that of the Qabalistic 'Tree of Life,' as a certain arrangement of the Sephiroth and 22 remaining Paths connecting them is termed, the author has constructed no less than 183 tables. “The Qabalistic information is very full, and there are tables of Egyptian and Hindu deities, as well as of colours, perfumes, plants, stones, and animals. The information concerning the tarot and geomancy exceeds that to be found in some treatises devoted exclusively to those subjects. The author appears to be acquainted with Chinese, Arabic, and other classic texts. Here your reviewer is unable to follow him, but his Hebrew does credit alike to him and to his printer. Among several hundred words, mostly proper names, we found and marked a few misprints, but subsequently discovered each one of them in a printed table of errata, which we had overlooked. When one remembers the misprints in ‘Agrippa’ and the fact that the ordinary Hebrew compositor and reader is no more fitted for this task than a boy cognisant of no more than the shapes of the Hebrew letters, one wonders how many proofs there were and what the printer’s bill was. A knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet and the Qabalistic Tree of Life is all that is needed to lay open to the reader the enormous mass of information contained in this book. The ‘Alphabet of Mysticism,’ as the author says—several alphabets we should prefer to say—is here. Much that has been jealously and foolishly kept secret in the past is here, but though our author has secured for his work the imprimatur of some body with the mysterious title of the A∴ A∴, and though he remains himself anonymous, he appears to be no mystery-monger. Obviously he is widely read, but he makes no pretence that he has secrets to reveal. On the contrary, he says, ‘an indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed.’ The writer of that sentence has learned at least one fact not to be learned from books. “G.C.J.” T"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":" “The Bomb” By FRANK HARRIS (John Long, 6 / —) M This sensational novel, by the well-known Editor of “Vanity Fair”, has evoked a chorus of praise from the reviewers, and has been one of the talked-of books of the season. We append a few criticisms:— MR. ALEISTER CROWLEY: “This book is, in truth, a masterpiece; so intense is the impression that one almost asks, ‘Is this a novel or a confession? Did not Frank Harris perhaps throw the bomb?’ At least he has thrown one now . . . This is the best novel I have ever read.” The Times: “ ‘The Bomb’ is highly charged with an explosive bent of Socialistic and Anarchistic matter, wrapped in a gruesome coating of ‘exciting’ fiction . . . Mr. Harris has a real power of realistic narrative. He is at his best in mid-stream. The tense directness of his style, never deviating into verbiage, undoubtedly keeps the reader at grips with the story and the characters.” Morning Post: “Mr. Frank Harris's first long novel is an extremely interesting and able piece of work. Mr. Harris has certainly one supreme literary gift, that of vision. He sees clearly and definitely everything he describes, and consequently . . . is absolutely convincing. Never for a moment do we feel as we read the book that the story is not one of absolute fact, and so convincing in its simplicity and matter-of-factness is Mr. Harris's style that we often accept his psychology before we realize . . . on how few grounds it is based. Some of the aspects of modern democracy are treated with astonishing insight and ability, and 'The Bomb' is distinctly not a book to be overlooked.” JACOB TONSON in the New Age: “The illusion of reality is more than staggering; it is haunting . . . Many passages are on the very highest level of realistic art . . . Lingg's suicide and death are Titanic . . . In pure realism nothing better has been done, and I do not forget Tolstoy’s ‘The Death of Ivan Illytch!’ It is a book very courageous, impulsively generous, and of a shining distinction . . .” Saturday Review: “He (Mr. Harris) is a born writer of fiction. ... Those two books of his, 'Elder Conklin' and 'Montes, the Matador,' contained the best short stories that have been written. ... Mr. Harris touches a high level of tragic intensity. And the scene of the actual throwing, and then the description of Schnaubelt's flight to New York in a state of mental and physical collapse, are marvels of tense narration. Altogether, the book is a thoroughly fine piece of work, worthy of the creator of Conklin. We hope it is the precursor of many other books from Mr. Harris.\" The Nation: “Mr. Harris has a born writer's eloquence, he has knowledge of his subject, and he often expresses himself with a distinction of phrasing and a precision of thought which give real value to his work.\" Daily Telegraph: “A good book . . . this story reads like a page of real life written down by a man who actually did take part in the scenes described so vividly. . . . We follow their fortunes breath- lessly. . . . Descriptions as vivid as any Mr. Upton Sinclair ever painted, and they are never tedious nor overdone. . . . We must not leave the tale without mentioning the wonderful love- story of Rudolph and Elsie, a fine piece of psychology, as true as it is moving, and of a quality rarely to be found in fiction.” "},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":" The Star in the West BY CAPTAIN J.
