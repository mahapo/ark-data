The growth of interest in these matters has been simply marvellous. Numberless societies, associations, orders, groups, etc., etc., have been founded in all parts of the civilized world, all and each following some line of occult study. While all these newly organized associations do some good in preparing the minds of thoughtful people for their eventually becoming genuine disciples of the One Truth, yet there is but ONE ancient organization of Mystics which shows to the student a Royal Road to discover the One Truth. This organization has permitted the formation of the body known as the ìANCIENT ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS.î It is a modern School of Magi. Like the ancient Schools of Magi it derived its knowledge from Egypt and Chaldea. This knowledge is never revealed to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX viii the profane, for it gives immense power for either good or evil to its possessors. It is recorded in symbol, parable and allegory, requiring a Key for its interpretation. The symbols of Freemasonry were originally derived from the more ancient mysteries, as all who have travelled the burning sands know. The ritual and ceremonies, signs and passwords have been preserved with great fidelity: but the Real Key has been long lost to the crowds who have been initiated, advanced and raised in Masonry. The KEY to this knowledge can, however, be placed within the reach of all those who unselfishly desire, study and work for its possession. The Symbols of Ancient Masonry, the Sacred Art of the Ancient Chemi (Egyptians), and Homer's Golden Chain are but different aspects of the One Great Mystery. They represent but different degrees of initiation. By the Right Use of the ìKeyî alone the ìMaster Wordî can be found. In order to afford genuine seekers after Hermetic Truth some information on the aims of the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars, we now print the preliminary instruction issued by the Fratres of this Order. FIRST INSTRUCTION To all whom it may concernó Let it be known that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient order of sages, whose object is the amelioration and spiritual elevation of mankind, by means of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS ix conquering error, and aiding men and women in their efforts of attaining the power of recognizing the truth. This order has existed already in the most remote and prehistoric times; and it has manifested its activity secretly and openly in the world under different names and in various forms; it has caused social and political revolutions, and proved to be the rock of salvation in times of danger and misfortune. It has always upheld the banner of freedom against tyranny, in whatever shape this appeared, whether as clerical or political, or social despotism or oppression of any kind. To this secret order every wise and spiritually enlightened person belongs by right of his or her nature; because they all, even if they are personally unknown to each other, are one in their purpose and object, and they all work under the guidance of the one light of truth. Into this sacred society no one can be admitted by another, unless he has the power to enter it him-self by virtue of his own interior illumination: neither can any one, after he has once entered, be expelled, unless he should expel himself by becoming unfaithful to his principles, and forget again the truths which he has learned by his own experience. All this is known to every enlightened person; but it is known only to few that there exists also an external, visible organization of such men and women who, having themselves found the path to real self-knowledge, are willing to give to others, desirous of entering that path, the benefit of their experience and to act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be guided. As a matter of course, those persons who are already sufficiently spiritually developed to enter into conscious communion with the great spiritual brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX x will be taught directly by the spirit of wisdom; but those who still need external advice and support will find this in the external organization of that society. In regard to the spiritual aspect of this secret order, one of the Brothers saysó ìOur community has existed ever since the first day of creation when the gods spoke the divine command: ëLet there be light!í and it will continue to exist till the end of time. It is the Society of the Children of Light, who live in the light and have attained immortality therein. In our school we are instructed directly by Divine Wisdom, the Celestial Bride, whose will is free and who selects as her disciples those who are devoted to her. The mysteries which we are taught embrace everything that can possibly be known in regard to God, Nature and Man. Every sage that ever existed in the world has graduated at our school; for without wisdom no man can be wise. We all study only one book, the Book of Nature, in which the keys to all secrets are con-tained, and we follow the only possible method in studying it, that of experience. Our place of meeting is the Temple of the Holy Spirit pervading the universe; easily to be found by the elect, but for ever hidden from the eyes of the vulgar. Our secrets cannot be sold for money, but we give them free to every one capable to receive them.î As to the external organization of that society, it will be necessary to give a glance at its history, which has been one and the same in all. Whenever that spiritual society manifested itself on the outward plane and appeared in the world, it consisted at its beginning of a few able and en-lightened people, forming a nucleus around which others were"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS xi attracted. But invariably, the more such a society grew in numbers, the more became attracted to its elements, such as were not able to understand or follow its principles; people who joined it for the purpose of gratifying their own ambition or for making the society serve their own ends obtained the majority over those that were pure. Thereupon the healthy portion of it retired from the field and continued their benevolent work in secrecy, while the remaining portion became diseased and disrupted, and sooner or later died disgraced and profaned. For the Spirit had departed from them. For this reason the external organization of which we speak has resolved not to reveal its name or place to the vulgar. Furthermore, for the same reason, the names of the teachers and members of this society shall remain unknown, except to such as are intimately associated with them in their common work. If it is said that in this way the society will gain only few members, it may be answered that our society has a spiritual head, and that those who are worthy of being admitted will be guided to it by means of their intuition; while those who have no intuition are not ripe for it and not needed. It is better to have only a comparatively small number of capable members than a great many useless ones. From the above it will be clear that the first and most necessary acquirement of the new disciple is that he will keep silent in regard to all that concerns the society to which he is admitted. Not that there is anything in that Society which needs to be afraid of being known to the virtuous and good; but it is not necessary that things which are elevated and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xii sacred should be exposed to the gaze of the vulgar, and be bespattered by them with mud. This would only impede the society in its work. Another necessary requirement is mutual confidence be-tween the teacher and the disciple; because a disciple who has no faith in his master cannot be taught or guided by him. There may be things which will appear strange, and for which no reasons can be given to the beginner; but when the disciple has attained to a certain state of development all will be clear to him or her. The confidence which is required will also be of little service if it is only of a short duration. The way of development of the soul, which leads to the awakening of the inner senses, is slow, and without patience and fortitude nothing will be accomplished. From all this it follows as a matter of course that the next requisite is obedience. The purpose of the disciple is to obtain the mastery over his own lower self, and for this reason he must not submit himself to the will of his lower nature, but follow the will of that higher nature, which he does not yet know, but which he desires to find. In obeying the will of the master, instead of following the one which he believes to be his own, but which is in reality only that of his lower nature, he obeys the will of his own higher nature with which his master is associated for the purpose of aiding the disciple in attaining the conquest over himself. The conquest of the higher self over the lower self means the victory of the divine consciousness in man over that which in him is earthly and animal. Its object is a realization of true manhood and womanhood, and the attainment of conscious immortality in the realization of the highest state of existence in perfection."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS xiii These few preliminary remarks may be sufficient for those who desire information concerning our order; to those who feel themselves capable to apply for admission, further instructions will be given.

What would life be without love? A desert! There would be no true happiness without love. And yet we must admit that love is in some ways a great danger. We must remember that many great teachers have forbidden it. What did the great Buddha say to Ananda? ìBeware of women, Ananda!î ìBut Lord, they are subtle of speech!î ìDonít speak to them, Ananda!î ìBut, Lord, suppose they speak to us?î ìKeep wide awake, Ananda!î Think of Paulís contemptuous permission, ìIt is better to marry than to burnîóit is easy to see that Paul had never been married!óand of his Masterís plain prohibition of anything of the sort. If our own Beloved Lord and Teacher does not join the band, it is (may I suggest with all humility?) because He wants us to be strong enough to manage our own affairs without resorting to the extreme of prohibition. But it is hard upon the weak. Think of A, who left the noblest and the most exalted pursuits for a baser love, a love in a boarding-house in Hoxton, a love with spectacles and elastic-sided boots; think of B, who married (on her holiday as a maid-of-all-work in Bayswater) a forty-pfenning fly-by-night from Hamburg, who cockolded him openly in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xxiv the streets of Venice, and nearly sobbed the station into the lagoon as she was torn shrieking from her favourite gondolier by the girls she was supposed to be chaperoning; think of C, who forgot the heavenly choir for the earthly, and of D, who was last seen in Naples being sick out of a window on the second floor; think of E, who married a girl named Ethel Maud, reaping in himself that recompense of his error which was meet; think of F, who might have performed the Operation of the Sacred Magic of Abra-melin the Mage, and has taken up Goat Golf instead; think of G, who went ashore once too often, and was caught by a girl named Alphonsina Nectarine Stubbs; think of H, who had to shave off the loveliest red beard to show what a strong chin he really had; think of Ióno! that isn't grammaróthink of Me! My catalogue need not stop there, but it shall. Against all this what have we to urge but the awful example of J, who wanted to store up Ojas, and went off his K ó nut? No, dear readers, love is not all that it's cracked up to be. It's a good boy to have to answer the bell, but it's a bad packing-house when you're the pig! Love is like champagne. You must drink it quickly; and if you keep it corked up too long, you find it has gone flat. It is a fine pick-me-up; but champagne all day is nastier than skilly. FRATER PERDURABO is a wise man. He never says ìKeep off the drink!î If you cannot drink soberly and decently you are not fit.

We learn only that the success of his plans was spoilt by a mutiny, which resulted in the death of four innocent people, and a good deal of damage to the mutineers, and that in con-sequence he went off to visit his old friend the Maharaja of Moharbhanj, and shoot big game. After spending a few days with this amiable despot, he went off alone into the jungle, and his thoughts immediately reverted to magic, to the performance of the Great Work, though not as yet to the Egyptian revelations. His antipathy to these, with their irrational instructions, grew and grew. It was only with the shattering of his reason that he could possibly accept them, and act on them. Yet even in this month's wandering in the jungle we find little in the diary but the record of exercise of strange magic powers. we read three or four times that a certain adept"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 9 joined him by night in the magical body. And on one nightó ìHad long colloquy with Golden Hawk; invitedóó(the Adept) and learnt that the Great Work was to create a new Universe. Whence severe self-criticism.î This at the end of his journey. Yet during this journey we find that he had written down the secrets of the Mystic Path in a mysterious MS., which few indeed have been privileged to see. In Calcutta he was very busy. He had been attacked by armed robbers, and, slaying two of them, was, in the then political condition of Bengal, likely to be offered up as a scapegoat. Further, his wife and child joined him, and it seemed most desirable that he should pursue his travels, which he did. But of this week one illuminating sentence is preserved. Fra. P. was driving through Calcutta with Mr. Eóó Tóó, and complaining to him that the analysis of impressions showed no connection between them. There was no coherence in the non-Ego, and so no sanity in the Universe. His companion pointed out that the same criticism applied with equal force to the Ego. This fell on Fra. P. with the force of a thunderbolt. He had always known this in an intellectual way; now it stabbed him to the heart. Through the rest of the drive he sat silent, and in the bustle of the succeeding days of ìBandobastî for his newly projected walk through China, this awakening stood behind his mind, alert and operative. From Calcutta he proceeded to Rangoon (Nov. 3-6), where"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 10 he found his old comrade, I.

He set his teeth and settled down doggedly to this consideration of the eternal why. Here is a being in Rangoon. Why? Because he wanted to see Bhikku A. M. Why? Because . . . and so on to the half-forgotten past, dark seas that phosphoresced as the clean keel of his thought divided them. But, as appears, he was even more absorbed in the question of the consecution of impressions. Is there any connection between any two things? We hear that he left Rangoon for Bhamo by the Irrawaddy steamer Java on the 15th. We can almost see himólean, brown, stern and immobile, watching the wavelets of the great river, and the flying-fish, and the one thought: Why? He shut off his reflective faculties, for he saw that there was nothing to reason about. Phenomena were consecutive, but not causally connected.1 On the 18th he writes: \"About now I may count my 1 This should be studied with chapter VIII of The Star in the West, and Humeís ìEssay on the Human Understandingî which he again read on the 17th."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 11 Speculative Criticism of the Reason as not only proved and understood, but realizedî; and on the 19th: ìThe misery of this is simply sickeningóI can write no more.î There is, however, an entry of this date in his little MS. book of vellum: ìI realize in myself the perfect impossibility of reason; suffering great misery. I am as one who should have plumed himself for years upon the speed and strength of a favourite horse, only to find not only that its speed and strength were illusory, but that it was not a real horse at all, but a clothes-horse. There being no wayóno conceivable wayóout of this awful trouble gives that hideous despair which is only tolerable because in the past it has ever been the Darkness of the Threshold. But this is far worse than ever before; for it is not a despair of the Substance, but of the Form. I wish to go from A to B; and I am not only a cripple, but there is no such thing as space. I have to keep an appointment at midnight; and not only is my watch stopped, but there is no such thing as time. I wish to make a cannon; and not only have I no cue, but there is no such thing as causality. ìThis I explain to my wifeî (! ! !óEd.), ìand she, ap-parently inspired, says, ëShoot it!í (I suppose she means the reason, but, of course, she did not understand a word of what I had been saying. I only told her for the sake of formulating my thought clearly in words.) I reply, ëIf I only had a gun.í This makes me think of Siegfried and the Forging of the Sword.

Indeed, there is absolute silence on all mystic matters until December 20, over a month later. On that day, jumping on to his Burmese pony, a few yards after fording the stream which marks the Chinese frontier, the animal backed before he was in the saddle, and fell with him over a cliff of some forty feet in height. ìNeither hurt,î he remarks. ìLater, kicked on the thigh by a mule.î It is of no purpose here to deal with Fra. P.ís private affairs; but one must mention that all this time of interior insanity he was ìplaying the manî very vigorously. His moral force no doubt saved the Europeans of Tengyueh from a panic which might easily have resulted in massacre. After the death, perhaps by poison, of the Consul, the admirable and undervalued Litton, he was the only person who kept his head, and knew how to assert the authority of the white man. So that we must understand that this ìblack insanityî of which Fra. P. speaks was a private little insanity of his own; it in no way interfered with the normal working of his magnificent and heroic brain.

On February 9 he writes: ìAbout this full moon consciousness began to break through Ruach into Neschamahî; and two days later: ìPu Peng to Ying Wa Kuan.

Now, how did this come about? Not from the meditation on the Reason, which ended once for all in the Destruction of that Reason, but by the ìSammasatiî meditation on his Kamma. Baffled again and again, the fall with his horse supplied the one factor missing in his calculations. He had repeatedly escaped from death in manners almost miraculous. ìThen I am some use after all!î was his conclusion. ìI am indeed SENT to do something.î For whom? For the Universe; no partial good could possibly satisfy his equation. ìI am, then, the ëchosen Priest and Apostle of Infinite Space.í Very good: and what is the message? What shall I teach men?î And like the lightning from heaven fell upon him these words: ìTHE KNOWLEDGE AND CONVERSA-TION OF THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL.î Just that.

Yet this is an account of the highest of the trancesóof Shivadarshana itself, as we know from other sources. The ìvision,î to use still the name become totally inadequate, appears to have had three main points in its Atmadarshana stageó 1. The Universal Peacock. 2. The Universe as Ego. ìI who am all and made it all abide its separate Lord,î i.e. the Universe becomes a single and simple being, without quantity, quality, or conditions. In this the ìIî is immanent, yet the ìIî made it, and the ìIî is entirely apart from it. (This is the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, or something very like it.) 3. This Trinity is transcended by an impersonal Unity. This is then annihilated by the Opening of the Eye of Shiva. It is absolutely futile to discuss this: it has been tried and failed again and again.

For the first time in the known history of the world there had arisen the combination of the utmost attainment with the intelligence and literary ability to make it comparatively articulate. It is no wonder, then, that we hail Fra. P. as the greatest of all Teachers.

He stared, fascinated as by a basilisk, his eyes starting further and further from his head as his moral sense dragged his body backwards along the Rue de Rivoli. By this means he cannoned into a worthy Frenchman (who refused to take him seriously) and so was shocked into himself. He pulled out his watch. Only an hour and a half to catch his train.

And he saw nothing ridiculous in that, just as he saw nothing beautiful in the photograph. Nakedness is lust: so ran his simple gospel of aesthetics.

Theodore Bugg was not a sensitive man; excess of intuitive sympathy had not made his life a hell; but he felt that his domestic relations were strained. Especially since ìthat Mrs. Grahameî had evinced a liking for Gertrude.

O my God! Damn it!î he screamed, ìhow did you get the keys of my little safe?î The girl had frozen colder than the stone, but there was a new light in her eye, and if the curl of a lip could tread a worm into the dust, that lip was hers and that worm the author of her being. She had withdrawn as one who comes suddenly upon a toad, and the first flaming of her face had died instantly to deadlier ice. Bugg saw his mistake, his masses of mistakes. There being but one more to make, he made it; and, finding himself in the frying-pan of discovery, leapt into the fire of things irrevocable and not to be forgotten. His fat, heavy-jowled, coarse face all twitching, he fell on his knees and clasped his hands together. ìSo you found me out? Don't, don't give away your poor old father, Gertie!

The action seemed to decide her. ìI'll give you an address to send my things to,î she said, and walked out of the garden. Theodore Bugg sat stunned. ìHoly things,î she had said.

He drew back the hammer. Cold sweat beaded his flabby face. He could not; and anyhow, how did one? He thought of many stories of people who had shot themselves ineffectively. He felt for his heart and failed to find it, wondered if it had stopped and he were dying, had a fit of fear paralysing all his will. He thought of himself lying dead. ìNo, by God! I can't do it!î he cried, and flung the pistol back into the drawer. As luck would have it, the weapon exploded. The bullet broke his jaw, tore away four molars, smashed the cheek-bone, pulped the right eye, and, glancing from the frontal bone, found its billet in the ceiling. He lost consciousness and fell.

It is to be supposed that Nature was weary of the procession, for Placide had never married, but lived alone in his hut in the forest of Fontainbleau, just too far from the borders for it ever to be worth his while to go into a village for a drink except on very special occasions. He had even been overlooked for military service; and the Prussians had come and gone without interfering with his chopping. He could not read or write, and his language had many less than half a thousand words. In such conditions he deserved his Christian name. In the forest even an hour calms the most turbulent spirit; a day will cure most worries; and a week with an axe may be recommended to neurasthenics as more than the equivalent of the most expensive Weir-Mitchell treatment and rest-cures. If fashionable doctors could afford to be honest, they would order work-cures for nine-tenths of their patients. Forty-eight years with an axe in the forest had turned Placide Gervez into a mixture of Stoic, Cynic, and Epicurean; he boasted the simplicity and fortitude of each in respect of pain, propriety, and pleasure. The droning hum of the forest, broken rarely by the birdsómagpie, crow, cuckoo, and nightingaleómeant nothing to him in the summer; nor did the monotonous drip depress him in the winter. The ringing thud of his axe and the crash of the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 82 murdered tree were neither history nor tragedy to him; the comic and the pastoral were equally sealed books, for the forest has neither satyrs nor shepherds. He had no sport, since in his boyhood his father had thrashed him for throwing his axe at a stag; and no society, for the nearest forester thought him a boor. He chopped to live, and lived to chop. It was the philosopher of the Rue de Chevreuse who cast the grain of sand into the wheels of this approximation to the solution of the problem of perpetual motion. The philosopher was really a painter, but so bad a painter that he was only known as a theorist in the cafe which supplied his crÍme de menthe. There he would hold forth interminably on God and man. Blessed with such means as a mediocre father's devotion to cutlery and an only son had supplied, it was his habit on occasion to descend into the country. Picture him, if you please, as very short and moderately fat, middle-aged at thirty-two, clad in a bourgeois suit and an artistís tie, a red handker-chief under a black felt hat upon a bushy head garnished with a little beard and moustache, perspiring in a sandy and interminable bridle-path leading from the Long Rocher to nowhere in particular. These walks he would undertake (a) for his health, (b) to absorb the beauties of natureóas he would often demonstrate. Yet the greatest of philosophers are not always logical, and he would have been compelled to discover other reasons for his choice of company. This consisted of a lady whose age was rendered only more uncertain by her efforts to nail conjecture to the number 25. Her hair paled visibly from"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE WOODCUTTER 83 the scalp, and her neck darkened visibly from the chin. She had made the fortune of India in rice powder, and of China in vermilion. The extravagance of her person and attire, exaggerated even for the CafÈ díHarcourt, the fortress whence her sallies, was in Fontainebleau a thing to make earthís guardian angels throw up the sponge. This was a summerís afternoon; and the strange pair, encountering Placide Gervez as he chopped, accosted him. The philosopher, whose irrelevant name was ThÈophraste Goulet, drew out a cigarette and offered it to his intended victim. It is impossible in a polite nation to leave a man until you have finished the cigarette he gives youóa man, if he was a man, once gave me an Irish cigarette, but that story is a separate chequeóand Placide could not have cut that knot save with his axe. However, in the first pause of the voluble ass for breath, he pointed to his work, uttered the adjective ìHard,î and continued to chop. However, the purport of the discourseóin a highly con-densed formówas as follows. God is good, was the First Postulate of Theophrastus. Hence, all God does is good. Hence, since God made man, He meant man to do good. Hence, man should do good. Agreed. Then, what is good? The necessities of life are good, for otherwise no other good were possible without them. Food is good, shelter is good, all that tends to the health of the individual and the reproduction of the species is good. For if not, let food be bad, let art be good. Then, since artists need food, good is based on bad, which is absurd. Agreed, then, that necessary things are good. Yes; but are"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 84 these the only good? No; for these benefits absorb only part of the time and energy of man. Is it good to chop wood? Yes, undoubtedly; but it is also good to render woodcutting in art. Then why should not the woodcutter be an artist? Why should he not chop miracles of carving? The Michael Angelo of Fontainebleau? Why not? What does Browning say? ìI want to know the butcher paints, the baker rhymes for his pursuit,î and so on. Very well; then what do you do that is truly good? That is, unnecessarily, supererogatively, and therefore superlatively good? You, my friend! You chop wood. Good. You cherish a fair wife; you have strong children to defend the fatherland. Good again. You eat, you drink, you make merry: all good. But do you achieve fame? No. Glory? No. Are you a great saint? No. A great artist? No. A great sinner? No. Nothing great? No. Very well, then: not good. Rise up, man! (the peroration) Be not slothful, be ambitious! Be statesman, artist, divine, strategist, inventor; nay, thief or murderer, if you will! But do not be content to chop wood! During this quarter of an hour of eloquence his was not the only discourse. The fair friend of the philosopher, eager to impress men in her way as he in his, and equally omnivorous, was busy with Placide Gervez. First a sidelong glance struck armour quite impenetrable to such assault, quickly followed by smiles first secret and then open, gestures at first subtle and at last unmistakable, finally by the unspeakable grimace of the tongue which she had learnt in her time at the red-shuttered convent in the Rue des Quatre Vents. Her triumph was that once the woodcutter struck aslant, and swore."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE WOODCUTTER 85 ThÈophraste ended his discourse, and, pleasantly parting, sauntered off with his mistress, arm-in-arm. Neither of them give their victim another thought. Out of the wood they went, and (thank God!) out of the story. But Placide leant upon his axe and stared after them. In his brain one thought only remained, which ThÈophraste might have formulated logically as ìSome men do not chop wood.î And in his heart and eye was a dull animal lust. Two strangers had come to his soulís Inn. There being only one room, he put them to bed together, in this form of something like it: ìChopóchopóchopóchop; Iím sick of it. Even if I had a fine girl from Paris like that, what could I do but chopóchopóchopóchop?î For the first time in his life he went home half an hour earlier than his custom, to the accompaniment of a terrific thunderstorm that rolled up from the valley of the Loing and fell like night upon the forest, like a dark winter's night that afternoon of May. He was wet to the skin before he reached his hut. Opening the door, he glowered with dull surprise. Equally wet, standing in one corner and wringing out a blouse, was a girl of about twenty years old, an Amazon maid. He could see that she was a ladyóthat is, that she was not a villager; but he had no means of knowing that she was the Honourable Diana Villiers-Jernyngham-Ketteringham. Placide spoke a patois that a Parisian might have surmised to be Cherokee, and Diana's boarding-school French would have been given up by that Parisian as no earthly language at all."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 86 She told him that she was staying at the Savoy Hotel at Fontainebleau, and had gone for a walk and lost her way in the forest; and she asked him how far was it to the nearest village, and would he please take her there, and she would give him money. All this while Placide lit his fire, and proceeded to cook beans. He did not understand her, or try to understand her. There was a strange animal in his hut, possibly a human animal; it might like beans; he would offer it beans. It was not his affair; his affair was to chopóchopóchopóchop. Diana was a little afraid of this silent beast at first. But the offer of food seemed kindly, and she ate some beans lest he should take offence, found them surprisingly good, nodded satisfaction, and even asked for more. This part concluded, she went to the door. The rain poured unceasingly; the forest stood in pools; and it was too dark to tell one tree from another. The woodcutter joined her, shook his head, said ìfarî and ìto-morrow,î and pointed to a heap of straw. This strong-minded young lady knew when to bow to the inevitable; she took an armful of the straw, and retiring with it to the other end of the hut, made the sleep sign which every savage understands, and lay down. Placide Gervez grunted assent, and lying down with a surly ìBon soirî dropped instantly to sleep. How was he to know what dreams would echo his quarter of an hour with the two philosophers of Paris? About eleven o'clock the next morning some the well-horsed search-party from Fontainebleau reached the hut."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE WOODCUTTER 87 At the door, as carefully stacked as the rest, they found the severed limbs of the Honourable Diana.

But she was a hard-working orphan, too, with no relations but a semi-mythical brother on the Yukon who had not found enough gold to send her any; and she earned her livingótwo pounds a weekóas violinist to the splendid tea-parties of the Hotel Escoffier. Her liking for Professor Zircon was little more than a childís, though the shaggy-headed old analyst told another story to his brother experts at the War Office. And indeed, though her nature was incapable of great passion, what she had she gave, and to the innocence of a child added a dogís fidelity and trust. Professor Zircon was a happy old man; he called her his Chloride of Gold. Muriel means salt, you know, he would explain to the fellows at the club, and salt is a compound of hydrochloric or muriatic acidóI wonder if we shall produce a little Zirconium Chloride! At this jest thus elaborated he was wont to laugh seven time a week; and trot happily back to his house in Kensington for dinner. Seven times a week he would let himself in through the laboratory and pretend surprise when he found Muriel reading a novelette in his own armchair. ìWhat, what! and how the deuce did you get in?î or ìTut! tut! my dear madam, to what am I indebted for the honour of this visit?î or ìI beg a thousand pardons, madam, I really thought this was my house,î and Muriel, genuinely pleased and amused, would enter into the little comedy,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 92 always ending up with kisses in the old armchair, and a dainty dinner. This had continued for nearly three years with no interruption but once when the Professor's wife, from whom he had long been separated, succeeded in getting into the house on some pretence, and creating a very considerable uproar before the professor and his butler could master her rage. She was a big muscular woman from Australia with the body of a tiger and the temper of a snake. She would have made a winning fight of it but for Zircon's adroit sortie to the laboratory and timely return with a bottle of chloroform. The professor dined alone that night; at the very outset of the battle Muriel had fled in tears to the little room in Walham Green where she lived under the alleged guardianship of a most paunchy ex-dresser. No other incident disturbed the ripples of their harmless, petty liaison. Even the earlier rumours of the brother in Alaska had died down to folk-lore. The Professor had never got away from his work in time to hear her play the fiddle; anyhow, he hated music. Nor had Muriel ever stayed too late to alarm her landlady, who thought she played at supper as well as at tea. The illness of the Secretary of War alarmed only the German Ambassador, who could not be positive that in case of his death an accident might not happen and a capable person be appointed to the post. The annoyance of his deathótelephoned to the Office at three oíclock one afternoonówas concentrated on Professor Zircon, torn away from a compound with half the Greek Alphabet dotted about its name by a white-haired little Colonel who"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"PROFESSER ZIRCON 93 assured him that it really wasn't decent. ìWe won't go to the Club, dear man. We'll just drop in at the Escoffier for tea.î The Professor grunted an assent; but he was more than half pleased. He wondered what his fairy looked like in her butterfly wings. The lounge of the Escoffier was full of people; but right across the room Professor Zircon could see Muriel with cornflowers in her yellow-ashen hair and her simple muslin dress. But she wore the diamonds he had given her, a string of starlight at her neck. How well he remembered that evening! He had taken her into the laboratory and heated up some sugar with sulphuric acid, loving her amazement as it swelled and blackened. ìThat is carbon now,î he had said, ìif we could only crystalize it, what splendid diamonds we could have! But we canítónot to any effect. Diamonds are always found in a kind of blue mudóI suppose there can't be any here?î leading her to a box full of modelling clay which he used in some of his experiments. And he made her dive and dirty her dear little fingers ever so, before she ran against the necklace. And when they retrieved it quite, and washed it, and he put it round her neck for her very own! She played in her demure, modest way; not very good, but pleasing enough to people who only wanted an excuse for not having to think sufficiently to talk while they wolfed foie gras and watercress, muffins and eclairs, cheesecakes and hot buttered toast. And she seemed to care as little for them as they for her. The Professor and the Colonel had risen to go."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 94 ìThat's my little MurielóI call her the Spirit of Saltó ha! ha! ho!î ìA damn nice little bit of fluffódamn lucky boy!î growled the Colonel, winking at a chorus girl (in two thousand pounds worth of furs) whose salary was thirty shillings a week. Suddenly the Professor paled. A last glance over his shoulder showed him that a bearded man had risen and was handing a flower to Muriel. And Muriel was blushing and trembling with some emotion too profound to estimate, but clear enough to the analyst. When a man has detected a thousandth of a grain of atropine in the carcass of a barmaid, he does not hesitate to read the heart of a girl. And as a Government expert he was clothed with official infallibilityóa triple buckler. He went on casually talking to the Colonel for a few minutes before politeness allowed him to throw himself into a moving taxicab and roar his address at the astonished driver. It was the first time he had come home to an empty house since he had picked up Muriel on an omnibus and carried her off to a discreet Italian restaurant near Sloane Square where a flask of Chianti emptied to the bottom had left not a dreg of discretion. The arm-chair shocked him. This was the last time that she would sit in it, the false little harlot! The eternal emptiness of things, the unbreakable solitude of life, struck a chill to his marrow. How was he to know that only by uttermost surrender of the self to the Beloved can that curse be broken?"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"PROFESSER ZIRCON 95 Then a gleam of sanity crossed the bigoted scientific mind of the man. She might be able to explain. But he brushed away the idea. How can a fact ever be upset? Credulity itself is reason compared to the mind of the logician who has once allowed emotion to infect his brain, who has missed the factor of the personal equation. The idea returned. So long she had sat there in her childish purity that the conservatism of his hard old brain reacted. It could not be. Things could not change. Yet? In the upshot he was English enough to try her before condemning her, German enough to lay a trap for her in the very nature of that trial. His consideration passed from judgment to execution, and his face set like a mask. Ultimately he went to a small safe in the wall, took out a half-hoop diamond ring, and dropped it into the coal-scuttle. Reward or punishment! Either the old trickóor a new one! He turned on his heel and went softly into the laboratory. Meanwhile Muriel Madox tripped along from the Escoffier in the bright February air. Her heart was very light and very anxious. The incident of the afternoonóshould she tell the Professor? Concealment was foreign to her nature; for the first time in her life she hesitated. How would it affect their relations? It would be better to think it over, to sleep on it. It never occurred to her for a moment that the Professor might already know. In the end she decided to say nothing; but so absorbed had been her tiny brain in its little problem that"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 96 she forgot the obvious corollary of removing the flower from her dress. She was nestled in the arm-chair when the old analyst tiptoed into the room and clapped his hands over her eyes. ìWho is it?î said he gaily. ìWhy, you're Jack from Alaska, of course,î she answered, laughing. ìGuess again?î And the child guessed the German Emperor, and Lewis Waller, and everyone else she could think of. ìWrong.î ìWrong.î ìWrong.î ìWhy,î she cried, jumping up and facing him, ìit's Professor Zircon! The last person in the world I should have expected to find here!î She threw her arms round his neck and called him a ìdear silly.î ìWell, what's the news, child?î ìNo news. I'm so sorry the chief's dead.î ìDoesn't matter to me. What a pretty flower in your dress!î She had an instinct of sudden and terrible danger; and lied instantly. ìI bought it for your buttonhole.î And she fastened it there. Professor Zircon called her a sweet, thoughtful fairy, and gave her a kiss. Such a shudder ran through him as rarely stirred his veins. He had some flash of memory, of Judas, perhaps, signalled across the forty years since he had heard the legend of the Gospels at his mother's knee. ìBut there is news!î he added gaily. \"I'm going to show you my great discovery. I've found out how to make"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"PROFESSER ZIRCON 97 diamonds. Just crystallizing coal, you see; so simple when you know how to do it. Wait a minute!

Now we'll see if we've managed to crystallize any coal\" So the child began to hunt in the scuttle, and in a few minutes found the ring glittering in its dusty setting, like the eyes of a snake in the jungle. ìOh, you darling!î she cried. ìOh, you old fraud! You said nothing about making gold!î ìAh! that's a little accident,î replied the Professor. ìDiscoveries never come singly.î ìAnd is it really for me? All my very own?î ìWho else should it be for, darling?î ìYou're a darling sweet boy.î ìRun away and wash your hands! I've warmed up your own element for you, you dear little Spirit of Salt!î She ran gleefully into the laboratory. On the bench stood the basin she had used so often, with the soap and towels neatly at its side. She seized the soap, and plunged both hands into the nearly boiling hydrochloric acid. Then she turned her head to him, her mouth a tragic square, incapable even of uttering even a shriek. ìHow will you play the fiddle,î screamed Zircon, ìwith no fingers? How will you play the harlot? I saw you and your lover. There's his flower!î He flung it at her. ìBut I'm even with youóOh! I'm even with you!î And he foamed into a spate of the filthiest abuse. It broke the spell.

She fell on the floor fainting. ìVile thing!î screamed Zircon, spurning her with his foot. He choked: his brain fell suddenly clear with the lucidity of intellect. He walked into the dining-room, and whistled as he walked. There he sat down. The next move in his infernal revenge was the waking of Muriel, and that might be soon or late. He had not calculated the effect of waiting; his nerves cried out. For the first time he had a glimpse of the doctrine of eternal punishmentóperceived that the resurrection of the body was no necessary condition. Tortured, he gazed upon the second hand of his watch. He could have sworn it stopped, when it shook and staggered on with the importance of Big Ben, and he realized that his own time-sense was radically upset. He wondered if it was the same with heróthe devil in him gloated. ìA gentleman to see you, sir!î said he butler, opening the door. ìHe wouldn't give his name!î ìIíll see him,î said Zircon, as blithe as a lark. ìShow him in!î In strode the bearded stranger of the afternoon. ìYou damned scoundrel!î he addressed the smiling Professor. ìSo this is where my sister spends her evenings!

He had that simplicity of vision, that flashing insight, which stamps the highest types of intelligence. When only six years old, while meditating on the increasing difficulty of earning an honest living, and the increasing risk of earning a dishonest one, he saw a fond mother give her little boy a penny to buy sweets. In a single second his mind was made up; his career was determined. How, thrilled the Master-Thoughtóhow can I get that penny? A rapid calculation assured him of the soundness of his instinct. Probably at least a hundred thousand mothersó of the world's six hundred millionógive a penny to some child every day. A hundred thousand pence a day is over a hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year; if he could only get ten per cent. of that, he wouldn't be doing so badly."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 246 That night, as he said his prayers at his mother's knee, she was surprised and pleased to hear a new petition: ìAnd oh! dear Jesus, do let me do ever such a great work for other little children! Bring them all in! Don't let me miss one out.î Hot stuff for six, I don't think. It was evident, to his astuteness and business capacity, that this work demanded the most complete organization. He therefore obtained a post under the Government, so that, while touching a good salary, his whole time was free to devote to his great scheme. ìPunctuality,î he often said to me, ìis the thief of time; procrastination is the soul of business,î and would justify his paradox by pointing out that if you only left letters unanswered long enough, the need to answer them disappeared. His system, in fact, became extremely popular; even Charles Dickens playfully animadverts upon it in one of his novels. A secretary being necessary to him, he pressed his sister Aóóinto the service, thereby saving her from such terrible temptations as love, marriage, or even occasional relaxation, which is known to be the devilís subtlest engine, and saving himself from the expense of hiring a drudge. He applied the same fine intelligence to all the problems of life. Onanism, he argued, is demonstrably safe and eco-nomical; further, it is secret, and can be passed off as chastity; hence credit with the pious. Again, ìI am out to get the money that parents give their children; I am the sole Inventor of the ëKinchin-layí; and I am certainly not going to queer my own pitch by getting children. I might have to give them pennies now and then myself.î Onanism consequently became the rule of his life; and it is only fair to say that I believe the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"AN OBITUARY 247 persistent rumours (especially in later years) of his assaults on young children to be entirely without foundation. At least it is certain that nothing was ever brought home to him. While he was still a young man he definitely founded an organization on the lines of the well-known and justly admired Children's Scripture Union. He issued a card, price one penny, with the days of the year, and a ìportion of Scriptureî indicated for reading on this day. As the card could be prepared in half an hour by any one, and printed at about fourpence halfpenny a hundred, there was a small but sufficient margin of profitóor would have been but for the expense of getting the scheme under way. My uncle's genius never hesitated. ìOf all the puppies on earth, the ëpií set at Cambridge are the most priggish,î he exclaimed enthusiastically. So he got hold of a few, and called them Evangelists. They were to go down (of course, at their own expense) to the seasideówhere the children with the pennies were, not to the slums, where there were plenty of children but no penniesóand hold ìservices,î the object of all which was to sell these cards, and force the unhappy infant who was really interested in Judges to switch off to Leviticus. Christian parents were, however, quick to see that my uncleís genius had forged a new tyranny, and his scheme had the heartiest of receptions.

My uncle was now in a position to develop his scheme fully, and the ring of philanthropic blackmailers and black-guards who run religious charities were compelled to admit him to a share of the spoils. He founded a Magazine, with some external and internal resemblance to that excellent paper, Our Own Magazine, which, with consummate impudence, he declared to contain nothing but true stories. These stories are usually about the good little girl who ìconvertsî the horrid, swearing bargee, and the good little boy who brings his ìthoughtlessî mother to Jesus. This, being a monthly, brought in another twelve pennies annually from every victim. He also published leaflets which he could sell by the hundred to the kind of idiot that likes to give such things to strangers who have never done it any harm. He had all these things translated into dozens of languages, and the rill of pennies swelled to a mighty river. By this time his sister Aóó was worn out, and died. For a month he had to pay a typist; but she little knew my uncle if she thought she had a permanent job. He rushed off to some ghastly Welsh ìresort,î to be acclaimed as the Founder of the Faith by the flourishing branch of the ìMissionî which he had established there, and, selecting a female with features and character of an anÊmic cow, married her and her money, sacked the typist, and settled down as the principal ornament of London's most suburban ìsubbub.î I suppose none even of his accomplices will regret his death; to the lachrymal glands of a crocodile he added the bowels of compassion of a cast-iron rhinoceros; with the"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"AN OBITUARY 249 meanness and cruelty of a eunuch he combined the calculating avarice of a Scotch Jew, without the whisky of the one or the sympathetic imagination of the other.

In feature resembling a shaven ape, in figure a dislocated Dachshund, his personal appearance was at the first glance unattractive. But the clothes made by a City tailor lent such general harmony to the whole as to reconcile the observer to the phenomenon observed. Of unrivalled cunning, his address was plausible; he con-cealed his genius under a mask of matchless mediocrity, and his intellectual force under the cloak of piety.

An associate of such creatures of an inscrutable Providence as Coote and Torrey, he surpassed the one in sanctimonious-ness, the other in bigotry, though he always thought blackmail too risky, and slander a tactical error. Without heart or conscience, either in his family relations or his public functions, he goes to a grave covered by the flowers of those who think it politic to pretend to honour him; and it is his tragedy that of all the obituaries penned by servile or venal dupes or accomplices of his misdeeds, none will survive the century.

A∴ A∴ "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" PREFACE AN any good thing come out of Palestine? is the broader anti-Semetic retort to the sneer cast by the Jews themselves against the harmless and natural Nazarene; one more example of the poetic justice of History. And no doubt such opponents of the modern Jew will acclaim this volume as an admirable disproof of that thesis which it purports to uphold. The dissimilarities, amounting in some cases to sheer contradiction, which mark many numbers, will appear proof positive that there is nothing in this numerical Qabalah, especially as we may presume that by filling up this dictionary from the ordinary Hebrew Lexicon one would arrive at a mere hotch-pot. Apart from this, there is a deeper-lying objection to the Qabalah; viz., that the theory is an example of the fallacy Post hoc propter hoc. Are we to believe, askes the sceptic, that a number of learned men deliberately sat down and chose words for the sake of their numerical value? Language is a living thing, with many sources and diverse; can it be moulded in any such arbitrary fashion? The only reply seems to be a mere assertion that to some extent it certainly is so. Examples of a word being spelt deliberately wrong do occur; and such a jugglery as the changing of the names Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah can hardly be purposeless. Once admit the end of such a wedge, and it is difficult to say whether it may not be driven home so far as to split asunder the Tree of Knowledge, if not the Tree of Life. Another line or argument is the historical. We do not here refer to the alleged forgery of the Qabalah by Rabbi Moses ben Leonówas it not?óbut to the general position of the ethnologist that the Jews were an entirely barbarous race, incapable of any spiritual pursuit. That they were polytheists is clear from the very first verse of Genesis; that Adonai Melekh is identical with ìMolochî is known to every Hebraist. The ìOld Testamentî is mainly the history of the struggle of the phallic Jehovah against the rest of the Elohim, and that his sacrifices were of blood, and human blood at that, is indisputable. C"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"PREFACE ivHuman sacrifices are to-day still practised by the Jews of Eastern Europe, as is set forth at length by the late Sir Richard Burton in the MS. which the wealthy Jews of England have compassed heaven and earth to suppress, and evidenced by the ever-recurring Pogroms against which so senseless and outcry is made by those who live among those degenerate Jews who are at least not cannibals. Is it to such people, indeed, that we are to look for the highest and sublest spiritual knowledge? To this criticism there are but two answers. The first, that an esoteric tradition of great purity may co-exist with the most crass exoteric practices. Witness the Upanishads in the land of Jagganath, hook-swinging, and the stupidest forms of Hatha-Yoga. Witness the Tipitaka (with such perfections as the Dhammapada) in the midst of peoples whose science of torture would seem to have sprung from no merely human imagination. The descriptions in the Tipitaka itself of the Buddhist Hells are merely descriptions of the actual tortures inflicted by the Buddhists on their enemies. The second, that after all is said, I find it works very well. I do not care whether 1− is an impossible, an unimaginable thing, or whether de Moivre really invented it, and if so, whether de Moivre was an immoral man, and wore whiskers. It helps me to make certain calculations; and so long as that is so, it is useful, and I stick to it. Other criticisms of the methods of the Qabalah itself have been made and disposed of in the article on the subject in ìThe Temple of Solomon the Kingî (Equinox V) and no further reference need be made to them in this place. It is only necessary to say that that article should be studied most thoroughly, and also the article ìA Note on Genesisî in the second number of The Equinox. With these two weapons, and the Sword of the Spirit, the Practicus, fully armed, may adventure himself in the great battle wherein victory is Truth. PERDURABO. "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" EDITORIAL NOTE HIS dictionary was begun by Allan Bennet (Fra∴ Iehi Aour, now Bhikku Ananda Metteya) in the last decade of the nineteenth century since y-J.C. It was bequeathed to the present Editor, with many other magical MSS., on I.A.ís departure for Ceylon in 1899. Frater Perdurabo used it, and largely added to it, in the course of his Qabalistic workings. With George Cecil Jones (Fra∴ Volo Noscere) he further added to it by making it a complete cross-correspondence to the book DCCLXXVII. It was further revised and checked, re-copied by a Jewish scribe, and again checked through, in the year V of the present Era. The mathematical additions were continued by Fra∴ P. and Fra∴ Lampada Tradam; and the MS. finally copies on a specially constructed typewriter by Gerald Rae Fraser (Fra∴ y) who added yet further mathematical data. This copy has again been checked by Fra∴ P. and Soror∴ N.N. and the proofs further by three separate scholars. The method of employing the dictionary has been fully indicated in The Temple of Solomon the King [Equinox V]. None of the editors claim to possess even the smallest degree of scholarship. The method of compilation has been to include all words given in Von Rosen-rothís Qabalistic Dictionary, those specially commented on in S.D., I.R.Q., and I.Z.Q., those given in 777, and those found by Fratres I.A. and P. Some of them are found in texts of the Hebrew scriptures which appeared to those adepts to be of magical importance. Owing to their carelessness, the meaning of some few words has been lost, and cannot now be traced. T"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"ABBREVIATIONS, SIGNS AND FIGURES K.D.

Thus is Abrahadabra a Key of the Pentagram. Also, by Aik Bkr, it = 22: and 418 = 19 × 22. 19 = Manifestation; it therefore manifest the 22Keys of R.O.T.A. The first meaning is ABRAH DBR, = The Voice of the Chief Seer.It resolves into Pentagram and Hexagram as follows: 1st method. AAADHRABBAR forms 12 and 406, awhand hta [406 = wt], where AThH= Microprosopus, and HVA = Macro-propopus. The Arcanum is therefore that of the Great Work. 2nd method. AAADHRABBAR here BHR = 207= rwa, ]ws }ya, etc., and DBR = Voice (ìThe Vision and the Voiceî); thus showing, by Yetziratic attribution, the Three WandsóCaduceus: Phoenix: Lotus. Note always rba are the three Supernals. 3rd method. AAADHRABBAR give 205 + 213;both mean ìMighty,î when Abra-hadabra is ìThe Word of Double Power.î AAB shows AB : AIMA : BN, viz., Amoun : Thoth : Mout. By Yetziratic MEthod, H : D : R : are Isis : Horus : Osiris. (Also, for H:D:R:, vide I.R.Q. 992.) Dividing as 3 and 8, we get Dof Horus dominating the Stooping Dragon, way rra; alsoó from AAADHRABBAR we get8 = dd, Love, and 207 = rwa, Light; 8 × 207 =18, which is equivalent to yj, Living; further, 207 = 23 × 9= hyj, Life: hence Licht : Liebe : Leben. Again, 418 = ta + way, = 21 + 397, q.v. rbd and 678 = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21. 2 ×b + 2 × r + d = 32. The Five different letters represent Amoun:Thoth:Isis:Horus:Osris.

The software I used to set up mathematical expressions cannot cope with the notation Crowley used to represent factorials. In the expressions for ||n and e I have therefore substituted the modern use of n! for n factorial. 0! is conventionally defined as 1; for a positive integer n, n! is thus equal to (n-1)! × n. e is defined as the sum from n = 0 to infinity of 1/(n!), otherwise written: ∑∞=≡01iie! While I am not familiar with the notation of sub-factorials used here, I will observe that if we similarly define sub-factorial 0 as 1 (again, simply as a convenience) then for any positive integer n, ||n = n × ||(n-1) + (-1)n. [(-1)n = 1 if n be even, -1 if n be odd.] Or we could have a computer do it thus (using the conventional notation of the C programming language): int subfact (int n) { if (n < 1) return 1; /* strictly speaking should be undefined for negative numbers */ else return (n*subfact(n-1) + 1 ñ 2*(n%2)); /* 1- 2*(n%2) is 1 if n be even, -1 if n be odd */ } Similarly, the rather ugly expression for ||n given in the preface simplifies to: ...!!!!!!!!+−+−3210nnnn to n+1 terms; or, in sigma notation, ∑=−niiin01!!)( I have made alterations to the page of abbreviations, signs and figures to reflect actual use. The notation of a box around a number to indicate a perfect square is used only in the table of factors; in the main table a root symbol was used. Similarly, we were informed that ìR (n) before [a number shows that the number is] a reciprocal (or ëamicableí) numberî which is nowhere defined and nowhere used. The printed edition did not explain that p was used in the main table to denote prime numbers. A ìperfectî number is one which is the sum of its factors (including 1), e.g. 6 = 1+2+3; 28 = 1+2+4+7+14; 496 = 1+2+4+8+16+31+62+124+248. The citations of ìS.D. ii. 467î in the entries for 157 and 227 refer not to the Sepher Dtzenouthia but to Blavatskyís Secret Doctrine. My thanks to Tim Maroney for this information. Pietro di Abano was neither the actual nor the imputed author of the ìArbatel of Magickî (de magia veterum), in fact ìArbatelî may well have been meant as the authorís name. The first and only known book of the ìArbatelî (an outline description of the work lists nine volumes) was printed as Basle in 1575 and bound up in vol. i of the Lyons edition (ca. 1600) of Cornelius Agrippaís Opera which included the Heptameron, a short Grimoire of planetary magick spuriously attributed to díAbano. References to page numbers in 777 have been changed to refer to column numbers. Finally, I will note that this etext of Liber D was completely re-entered by myself, and I take full responsibility for any errors in it which do not occur in the printed edition. I have corrected a few errors which could be dealt with within the entry for a given number: many words are mis-spelt, and placed at the correct numeration for the mis-spelling. ó T.S.]"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":" 253 REVIEWS MY PSYCHIC RECOLLECTIONS. By MARY DAVIES. 2s. 6d. net. Nveleigh Nash, 36 King Street, Covent Garden, W.C. JUST when I had given up hope, Mary Davies comes to make a third to myself and Geo. Washington. For on p. 2 she says, ìMore than forty years ago . . . I was a girl of seven years old.î This storms the citadel of confidence, and pulls out the back teeth of the Dragon Doubt. I was therefore prepared to believe anything she might say. And accordingly we get a simple, charming, old-fashioned motherly book, full of kindly thought and real piety; that it may have no objective value for the S.P.R. is quite unimportant for the class of readers whom it is intended to reach. Mrs. Davies is a ìprofessional mediumî; of such I have said things which only my incapacity for invective prevented from being severe. But though (no doubt) the phenomena recorded in this book are ënon-evidential,í I do feel the sincerity of the writer. I am confident of her good faith. DIOGENES. TABLOID TALES. By LOUISE HEILGERS. 1s. TO quote the preface of Horatio Bottomley, ìLouise Heilgers is the only female writer of short stories of the present day.î She is in truth one of the ten million, her heart is their heart, her mind their mind, and consequently her thoughts their thoughts. She will soon be acclaimed as a popular author. It is refreshing indeed to find somebody writing direct from the heart without in any way striving after originality. Excepting as to their length, these stories do not in any manner resemble those of Baudelaire. BUNCO. THE CITY OF LIGHT. By W.L. GEORGE. Constable. 6s. A VERY adequate and even thorough study of French bourgeois life as it really is. As a picture, it is better than anything Zola ever did, though (for the"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 254 same reason) it lacks just that which Zola always givesóa sense of tragedy. Probably Mr. George will say (with a maiden blush) that his novel is none the worse for that; he would deny the truth of the poetís visionóinsist that the cosmos is but incoherency of heterogeneous incident. I may, however, urge with more hope of his attention that his novel breaks off at the really interesting part. What did Suzette say? Did the family tyranny make a man of Henri? Were they married, and, if so, what came of it? I wait patiently on Mr. George; may he incline unto me and hear my cry! A. C. ONE OF US. By GILBERT FRANKAU. 3s. 6d. ADMIRABLE, this Odyssey of emasculation. The verse is at all times facile and clever beyond all praise, though there are three or four faulty rhymes, and I cannot pass (twice) ìpleecemanî and ìpleece,î unless they are so spelt. The story is very typical and very tragic. An idle youth without enough guts even to go wrong. When, after infinite struggle, he gets into debt, an aunt conveniently dies and leaves him everything. After innumerable mild philanderings, not one of which brings him even within whistling distance of the mÈthode du Dr. Fernandez, he returns to the lady whose acres adjoin his own; and Mr. Frankau, with consummate art, leaves us uncertain whether he will even summon up the energy to marry her. Smart, shallow, shoddy society in every clime is pictured admirably well; this book will be a classic, in a hundred years, for its historical interest. But it behoves somebody to write a commentary within the next twelve months, or a good third of the allusions will be for ever unintelligible. It is one of the most readable books I have struck for a long while; alas! that so depressing a portrait should be so real. Anarchy would become the only thinkable political creed if ìOne of Usî represented more than a negligible and almost outworn fringe of the antimacassar of society. ALEISTER CROWLEY.

WE extend the hand of brotherhood to Colonel Forman. While regretting to some extent the extreme lengths to which he has gone in making it quite clear to cowans and eavesdroppers exactly what happens in the Raising, and in publishing careful diagrams of the secret steps, etc., the only possible ambiguity, e.g. in the murder of H.A., being that lóó tóó might stand for left testicle, we think it is better so. Since English Freemasonry has become soulless formalism, let us at least perform the ceremonies with decorum! Your reviewer is personally a staunch Tory, and cannot help preferring the ìEmulationî working which long years have endeared to him. But never will he consent to the foul hash of the 23rd Psalm (Miltonís, I suppose) here still printed. Colonel Forman shows a good deal of insight into the true meaning of Masonry, and a real understanding of the symbolism.

LEVERSON is easily the daintiest and wittiest of our younger feminine writers; but she does well to call her latest masterpiece Tenterhooks. Mrs. Leverson offers us a picture of an aged, wrinkled and bedizened Jewess with false hair and teeth, painted and whitewashed with kohl, rouge and chalk until there seems hardly any woman there at all. Yet not content with addiction to indiscriminate adultery and morphine, she finds pleasure in seducing young men and picking their pockets. Fie! you can surely show us a prettier picture than that. Why not return to your earlier manner? Not necessarily the manner of An Idyll in Bloomsbury, but you might advantageously find material in Brixton or Bayswater. FELIX. THE MASTER MASON'S HANDBOOK.

The artist's conceptions are far below those of the author, which has a tendency to deter rather than help the reader.

BY ALEISTER CROWLEY The ìDaily Mailî saysóìThis is a garland of some fifty or sixty devotional hymns to the Virgin, in which the author, while not exceeding the bounds of Catholic orthodoxy, fills his verses with quaint and charming conceits, very much in the style of the ëmetaphysicalí poets of the seventeenth century. Indeed, in turning over the pages of ëAmphora,í as the little volume was entitled when published anonymously two years ago, by Burns & Oates, we feel them to be the work of a recipient of the tradition of Vaughan the Silurist, George Herbert, and Crashaw, although Mr. Crowley is smooth where they are rugged, plain where they are perplexing. ìThese poems indicate a mind full of earnest aspiration towards his spiritual Queen, a mind of an engaging naivetÈ, un- troubled by the religious and philosophical problems which weary more complex intelligences. This little work can be cordially recommended to Catholic readers.î Father Kent writes in ìThe TabletîóìAmong the many books which benevolent publishers are preparing as appropriate Christmas presents we notice many new editions of favourite poetic classics. But few, we fancy, can be more appropriate for the purpose than a little volume of original verses, entitled 'Amphora,' which Messrs. Burns & Oates are on the point of publishing. The following stanzas from a poem on the Nativity will surely be a better recommendation of the book than any words of critical appreciation: ìThe Virgin lies at Bethlehem. (Bring gold and frankincense and myrrh!) The root of David shoots a stem. (O Holy Spirit, shadow her!) ìShe lies alone amid the kine. (Bring gold and frankincense and myrrh!) The straw is fragrant as with wine. (O Holy Spirit, shadow her!)î Lieut.-Col. Gormley writesóìThe hymns ordinarily used in churches for devotional purposes are no doubt excellent in their way, but it can scarcely be said, in the case of many of them, that they are of much literary merit, and some of them indeed are little above the familiar nursery rhymes of our childhood; it is therefore somewhat of a relief and a pleasure to read the volume of hymns to the Virgin Mary which has just been published by Messrs. Burns & Oates. These hymns to the Virgin Mary are in the best style, they are devotional in the highest degree, and to Roman Catholics, for whom devotion to the Virgin Mary forms so important a part of their religious belief, these poems should indeed be welcome; personally I have found them just what I desired, and I have no doubt other Catholics will be equally pleased with them.\" ìVanity Fairî saysóìTo the ordinary mind passion has no relation to penitence, and carnal desire is the very anti- thesis of spiritual fervour. But close observers of human nature are accustomed to discover an intimate connection between the forces of the body and the soul; and the student of psychology is continually being reminded of the kinship between saint and sinner. Now and then we find the extremes of self and selflessness in the same soul. Dante tells us how the lover kissed the trembling mouth, and with the same thrill describes his own passionate abandonment before the mystic Rose. In our own day, the greatest of French lyric poets, Verlaine, has given us volumes of the most passionate love songs, and side by side with them a book of religious poetry more sublimely credulous and ecstatic than anything that has come down to us from the Ages of faith. We are all, as Sainte-Beuve said, ëchildren of a sensual literature,í and perhaps for that reason we should expect from our singers fervent religious hymns. ìThere is one of London's favourites almost unrivalled to express by her art the delights of the body with a pagan simplicity and directness. Now she sends us a book, ëAmphora,í a volume of religious verse: it contains song after song in praise of Mary,î etc. etc. etc. The ìScotsmanî saysóìOutside the Latin Church conflicting views are held about the worship of the Virgin, but there can be no doubt that this motive of religion has given birth to many beautiful pieces of literature, and the poets have never tired of singing variations on the theme of ëHail Mary.í This little book is best described here as a collection of such variations. They are written with an engaging simplicity and fervour of feeling, and with a graceful, refined literary art that cannot but interest and attract many readers beyond the circles of such as must feel it religiously impossible not to admire them.î The ìDaily Telegraphî saysóìIn this slight volume we have the utterances of a devout anonymous Roman Catholic singer, in a number of songs or hymns addressed to the Virgin Mary. The author, who has evidently a decided gift for sacred verse and has mastered varied metres suitable to her high themes, divides her poems into four series of thirteen eachóthus providing a song for each week of the year. The songs are all of praise or prayer addressed to the Virgin, and though many have a touch of mysticism, most have a simplicity of expression and earnestness of devotion that will commend them to the author's co-religionists.î The ìCatholic Heraldî saysóìThis anonymous volume of religious verse reaches a very high level of poetic imagery. It is a series of hymns in honour of Our Lady, invariably expressed in melodious verse. The pitfalls of religious verse are bathos and platitude, but these the sincerity of the writer and a certain mastery over poetic expression have enabled himóor heróto avoid. The writer of such verse as the following may be complimented on a very high standard of poetic expression: ìThe shadows fall about the way; Strange faces glimmer in the gloom; The soul clings feebly to the clay, For that, the void; for this, the tomb! ìBut Mary sheds a blessed light; Her perfect face dispels the fears. She charms Her melancholy knight Up to the glad and gracious spheres. ì O Mary, like a pure perfume Do thou receive this falling breath, And with Thy starry lamp illume The darkling corridors of death!î The ìCatholic Timesî saysóìThe ëAmphoraí is a collection of poems in honour of our Blessed Lady. They are arranged in four books, each of which contains thirteen pieces. Thus with the prologue there are fifty-three poems in all. Needless to say they breathe a spirit of deep piety and filial love towards our Heavenly Mother. Many beautiful and touching thoughts are embodied in the various verses, which cannot but do good to the pious soul.î The ìStaffordshire Chronicleî saysóìUnder this title there has appeared an anonymous volume of verses breathing the same exotic fragrance of Rossettiís poem on Our Lady that begins ëMother of the fair delight.í There is the same intense pre-Raphaelite atmosphere, the same aesthetic revelling in Catholic mysticism, the same rich imagery and gorgeous word-colouring that pervade the poetic works of that nineteenth-century artist. A valuable addition to the poetic literature on the Mother of our Lord.î The ìGuardianî saysóìThe devotional fervour of ëAmphoraí will make them acceptable to those who address their worship to the Blessed Mother of the Christ. The meaning of the title of the book is not very obvious. It cannot surely have anything to do with the lines in Horace, ëAmphora coepit,í î etc. The ìCatholic Timesî saysóìAs far as we can gather from his other works, the author is not a Catholic, perhaps not even, strictly speaking, a Christian; but here we have page after page of most exquisite praise of Her, whom Wordsworth greeted as ëour tainted nature's solitary boast,í until one marvels at the fecundity of concept, imagery, and fit expression.î"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":" OCCULTISM To the readers of ìThe Equinox.îóAll who are interested in curious old Literature should write to FRANK HOLLINGS for his Catalogue of over 1000 items.

The original work, of which this is a translation, is unique, no other copy being known, although both Bulwer Lytton and Eliphas Levi were well aware of its existence; the former having based part of his description of the sage Rosicrucian Menjour on that of Abra-Melin, while the account of the so-called Observatory of Sir Philip Derval in the Strange Story was, to some extent, copied from that of the Magical Oratory and Terrace given in the present work. There are also other interesting points too numerous to be given here in detail. It is felt therefore that by its publication a service is rendered to lovers of rare and curious Books, and to Students of Occultism, by placing within their reach a magical work of so much importance, and one so interestingly associated with the respective authors of Zanoni and of the Dogma and Ritual of Transcendental Magic. The Magical Squares or combinations of letters, placed in a certain manner, are said to possess a peculiar species of automatic intelligent vitality, apart from any of the methods given for their use; and students are recommended to make no use of these whatever unless this higher Divine Knowledge is approached in a frame of mind worthy of it.

B. Neuburgís ëTriumph of Paní (ëThe Equinoxí Office), much of which merits the ambiguous distinction of being unusual. Though by no means deficient in originality, vigour or imaginative power, his verse is too often cumbered with the fantastic symbols of a species of erotic mysticism, into which we feel no desire to probe; while the lack of reticence consistently displayed constitutes an artistic blemish not lightly to be excused. The authorís serene confidence in the immortality of his lays would be better justified were he to make some attempt to discriminate between the gold and the rubbish, and, incidentally, refraining from penning such grotesque- ness as is contained, for example, in ëThe Sunflower,í where we are informed how, among other portentsó  ì ëa greater god arose, And stole the earth by standing on his toes And blowing through the air.í ìIt is difficult to believe that the persons to whom certain poems are inscribed will experience any very lively gratification at the compliment.îóAthenaeum. ì. . . really notable fluency and fecundity of expression. . . . He gives us little of that boring stuff that is usually termed 'strong meat.' ... his dedicatory poem is the one that fascinates me most.

I take the liberty of quoting it in full. . . .îóNew Age. ìFie, Mr. Neuburg! . . . a most regrettable collection of songs that deal with unrestrained affection. . . . Thereís no denying they are first-rate verse.îóPERCY FLAGE in The Equinox. ì. . . We are dizzied and dazzled by a foaming rainbow-hued torrent of impassioned words. We are struck by the wealth and boldness of the imagery, and the facility of mechanical execution. . . . It is brilliant work . . . one is bound to admire the cleverness of it all.îóLiterary Guide. ì. . . In the author of the present collection of poems . . . we have a veritable twentieth-century mystic and apostle of ecstasy who, according to his dedication, gives his songsó ì ëBy the sign that is black and forbidden,  By the word that is uttered no more.í ì'The Triumph of Pan,' from which the book borrows its title, is a remarkable sequence of some forty ëphilosophic and ecstaticí stanzas . . . he would also seem to ëhold opinion with Pythagorasí although we question if even Nietzsche himself could quite fathom the undercurrent of the lay. . . . Despite occasional extravagances in thought and in diction his work is that of a cultured scholar, his verbal artistry undeniably inspired with the true spirit of poetry. Whether he sings of ëViolet skies all rimmed in tune,í of red ravens, of purple kisses, of silver stars ëcrested with amber melody,í or of the 'rhythmic sway of the idle moon,' he is always musical albeit, like Wagner, whose effects he now and then distinctly recalls, often utterly unintelligible. . . . In striking contrast to the chaste and serenely beautiful ëDiana Ridesí . . . are no less that twenty-two audaciously passionate love-lyrics inscribed not only to one Olivia Vane, but also, curiously enough to her ëotherí lover.îóThe Gambolier. ìHe has arrived. . . . ìMr. Neuburg's work is partly mystical and partly of the flesh. . . . Quite frankly, some of his work we do not at all understand. This applies notably to his ëMusic-Pictures,í which ëwere obtained under the direct influence of music.í ëThis,í the poet naively tells us, ëmay explain their apparent incon- sequence.í . . . he is much more than a minor poet. He can and will yet accomplish great work. . . . His ingenious rhyming capacity sometimes almost startles one. In the choice of some of this subjects he is daringógreatly daring. . . . His genius is undoubted; and the world has a lot yet to hear of and from this gifted singer.îóGreater London Illustrated. ìIf he rejects this mask, Mr. Neuburg may become a poet.îóRhythm."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":" The Star in the West BY CAPTAIN J.

We shall reward you by befoulment, by cant, by misunderstanding, and by understanding. This to you who wear the Phrygian cap, not as symbol of Liberty, O ribald ones, but of sacrifice and victory, of Inmost Enlightenment, of the soul's deliverance from the fetters of the very soul itself ófear not; you are not ëreplacing truth of thought by mere expertness of mechanical skill.í ìYou who hold more skill and more power than your great English predecessor, Robertus de Fluctibus, you have not feared to reveal ëthe Arcana which are in the Adytum of God-nourished Silenceí to those who, abandoning nothing, will sail in the company of the Brethren of the Rosy Cross towards the Limbus, that outer, unknown world encircling so many a universe.î ìJohn Bull,î in the course of a long review by Mr. HERBERT VIVIAN ìThe author is evidently that rare combination of genius, a humorist and a philosopher. For pages he will bewilder the mind with abstruse esoteric pronouncements, and then, all of a sudden, he will reduce his readers to hysterics with some surprisingly quaint conceit. I was unlucky to begin reading him at breakfast and I was moved to so much laughter that I watered my bread with my tears and barely escaped a convulsion.î ìThe Timesî ìThe Light wherein he writes is the L.V.X., of that which, first mastering and then transcending the reason, illumines all the darkness caused by the interference of the opposite waves of thought. . . .

A∴ A∴ PUBLICATION IN CLASS B. ====================== BOOK 777 HIS book contains in concise tabulated form a comparative view of all the symbols of the great religions of the world; the perfect attributions of the Taro, so long kept secret by the Rosicrucians, are now for the first time published; also the complete secret magical correspondences of the G∴ D∴ and R. R. et A. C. It forms, in short, a complete magical and philosophical dictionary; a key to all religions and to all practical occult working. For the first time Western and Qabalistic symbols have been harmonized with those of Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, &c. By a glance at the Tables, anybody conversant with any one system can understand perfectly all others. The Occult Review says: ìDespite its cumbrous sub-title and high price per page, this work has only to come under the notice of the right people to be sure of a ready sale. In its authorís words, it represents ëan attempt to systematise alike the data of mysticism and the results of comparative religion,í and so far as any book can succeed in such an attempt, this book does succeed; that is to say, it condenses in some sixty pages as much information as many an intelligent reader at the Museum has been able to collect in years. The book proper consists of a Table of ëCorrespondences,í and is, in fact, an attempt to reduce to a common denominator the symbolism of as many religious and magical systems as the author is acquainted with. The denominator chosen is necessarily a large one, as the author's object is to reconcile systems which divide all things into 3, 7, 10, 12, as the case may be. Since our expression ëcommon denominator' is used in a figurative and not in a strictly mathematical sense, the task is less complex than appears at first sight, and the 32 Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation of the Qabalah, provide a convenient scale. These 32 Paths are attributed by the Qabalists to the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations of Deity, and to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are again subdivided into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters. On this basis, that of the Qabalistic ëTree of Life,' as a certain arrangement of the Sephiroth and 22 remaining Paths connecting them is termed, the author has constructed no less than 183 tables. ìThe Qabalistic information is very full, and there are tables of Egyptian and Hindu deities, as well as of colours, perfumes, plants, stones, and animals. The information concerning the tarot and geomancy exceeds that to be found in some treatises devoted exclusively to those subjects. The author appears to be acquainted with Chinese, Arabic, and other classic texts. Here your reviewer is unable to follow him, but his Hebrew does credit alike to him and to his printer. Among several hundred words, mostly proper names, we found and marked a few misprints, but subsequently discovered each one of them in a printed table of errata, which we had overlooked. When one remembers the misprints in ëAgrippaí and the fact that the ordinary Hebrew compositor and reader is no more fitted for this task than a boy cognisant of no more than the shapes of the Hebrew letters, one wonders how many proofs there were and what the printerís bill was. A knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet and the Qabalistic Tree of Life is all that is needed to lay open to the reader the enormous mass of information contained in this book. The ëAlphabet of Mysticism,í as the author saysóseveral alphabets we should prefer to sayóis here. Much that has been jealously and foolishly kept secret in the past is here, but though our author has secured for his work the imprimatur of some body with the mysterious title of the A∴ A∴, and though he remains himself anonymous, he appears to be no mystery-monger. Obviously he is widely read, but he makes no pretence that he has secrets to reveal. On the contrary, he says, ëan indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed.í The writer of that sentence has learned at least one fact not to be learned from books. ìG.C.J.î T"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":" WILLIAM NORTHAM, ROBEMAKER, 9 Henrietta Street, Southampton Street, Strand TELEPHONEó5400 Central MR.

The following full-page plug for Book 4 appeared on the back board of the first edition. The music scores at the beginning are presented as 150 d.p.i. black and white scans; this seems about the limit at which they remain readable. I have neither the patience nor the knowledge of musical notation necessary to re-set them. In The Symbolic Representation of the Universe, a number of apparent errors occur in both the texts and translations of the Angelic Keys or Calls. With the exception of what appeared to be obvious typos these have not been corrected; the student is directed to sources like James (Enochian Evocation, a.k.a. Enochian Magick of Doctor John Dee), Turner (Elizabethean Magic) and Laycock (Enochian Dictionary), as well as to the electronic version of this text annotated by myself, online at http://www.geocities.com/nu_isis/liber084.pdf The Ankh design for the Tarot has been re-drawn and coloured. It has not, however, been completely conformed to the description in the text: adding the names of the Trumps to the circle would make an unreadable mess of it; and the Taurus sign and pentacle would have to be made disproportionately small to fit in the Earth space where the arms of the Tau join. The writing in Theban script at the top reads HRU not HUA and should be read left to right (the Theban script corresponds to the Latin alphabet, not the Hebrew). Some errors in the printed edition of the Tarot paper (planetary symbols and Hebrew names of the angels; the compositor consistently gave Kaph for Nun) have been corrected (the majority by Heidrick). Only a few of the errors in Sepher Sephiroth have been corrected in this edition; see my notes at the end of that text. In notes to his key entry, Bill Heidrick remarks that in the original the body of the work was printed single-sided. Heidrick also remarks of Sepher Sephiroth: Some curiosity will undoubtedly be evoked by the many Latin meanings of Hebrew words given below. Most of these are directly from the glossary in Kabbalah Denudata, but others are euphemisms for sexual terms. Kabbalah Denudata is available on microfilm, but no translation of the Latin or checking of the entries from that source or Kabbalah Unveiled by Mathers has been attempted yet. An extensive study of these entries will be included in the Gematria project now in process of compilation by Bill Heidrick. This project is expected to ultimately extend to several times the number of entries here, including notes of source, discussions of differences between Crowley's approach and that of traditional Qabalah and into new areas. I believe that some of Bill Heidrickís Qabalistic researches have been published in the journal of Thelema Lodge, O.T.O.
