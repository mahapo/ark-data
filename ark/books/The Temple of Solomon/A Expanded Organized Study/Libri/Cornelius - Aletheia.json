Astrology does not lay claim to anything else.\" -Carl Gustav Jung How the mind can torture itself in its quest to under­stand the travels of the soul from life, through death, to life again. Tormented, the mystic asks: \"What is the purpose of it all?\", \"Why was I born?\", \"From whence have I come, and to where will I go when I have shed my frail earthly form?\" But the answers prove elusive. Instead of certainty the mystic finds only speculation and surmise. Baffled, he struggles to recover memo­ries of a life before birth, in the hopes that these might shed light on what transpires after death. Yet here again he is stymied, for like all others who move from one rebirth to the next, the mystic had first to dally in the land of the dead.

This cleansing of their past goes unnoticed by most people, however, something deep within the mystic is left unsettled. He finds that his thoughts and dreams are disturbed, as if by glimpses of some long-forsaken ambition, a memory of which hovers just unseen on the very edge of his vision. In truth, the mystic did not draw as deeply from the River of Forgetfulness as his less contemplative fellows, and some distant memory goads him into joining that age-old quest for meaning. The ancient Greeks realized that active self-re­flection was something integral to understanding the mysteries of birth, life and death which would allow a person to find his appropriate place in the eternal processes of the Gods. \"Life is shrouded in a mystery; this is the fun­damental fact which confronts us. We live in a cave with our backs to the light, and, as Plato said, our knowledge is nothin9 more than the shadows which play upon its walls.\" The Greeks became preoccupied with this \"Inner Light\" that cast shadows into our reality. They summed up their quest for it with the axiom \"Know I. J. F. C.

They believed that mankind could never fully comprehend or know the human spirit, so this axiom actually suggests learning about and controlling personal behavior in the here now so that a person might rise to understand his or her Fate or incarnation and in effect, find unity with the Gods. Similar deliberations on matters of birth, life, death and reincarnation have taken place in most oth­er societies and cultures. In India the ideas solidified and became the foundation upon which the various forms of yoga are based. The Sanskrit word \"yoga\" is derived from the root \"yo}\" which means \"to control\" or \"unite\" and thus the word yoga is often translated as simply meaning the \"Art of Union.\" Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), the founder of modern analytical psychology, acknowledged the im­portance of studying yoga but he also cautioned that the practice may not be suitable for the western mind. He believed the yogic tendency to seek spiritual tran­scendence by ignoring the material side of the world was misguided, and that the purpose of incarnation was actually to gain a more intimate understanding of existence. As he wrote: \"There are many different kinds of yoga and Europeans often become hypnotized by it, but it is essentially Eastern, no European has the necessary"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"X ALE THE!

He seems to suggest that psychology could play that role, but to me there is a difficulty here. In an echo of yoga we find modem psychology preoccupied with bringing the unconscious mind to conscious aware­ness whilst either downplaying the role of the body or treating it merely as a cumbersome appendage that must be mastered. To me the core premise of Western magick is that we incarnate into our body in order to gain an experience, not transcend it, and that we must examine the whole process equally. This holistic ap-2.

Besides being a Jungian psychologist, Dane Rudhyar (1895-1985) was one of the most thoughtful practitioners of modem astrology. Reflecting on such matters he observed that: \"Ancient Hindu yoga was based on this realiza­tion of the meaning and power of the breath; and so also, in another sense, was astrology. Astrology was the means to relate the first moment of the individual­ized freedom (the first breath) to the eternal cosmic process. Astrology was therefore, and can be today, a method to take the individual out of his isolation and to incorporate him in the eternal process.\"4 It is my intention to offer a fresh approach to this subject of Union, through the study of astrology. As mortals we have been given clues as to how to manipulate our lower ego so that we may surrender self without losing the over-all ego, which is the driv­ing factor we require to appreciate the experience for which we incarnated. Astrology blends together mind, body and our reality, revealing each as an in­tegral part of the other and in so doing it underscores 4.

At this point I should make clear that this book is not about predicting the future or consulting the stars in order to see what the Gods might have in store for us. To me the rigidity of traditional astrology does not present an individual with the possibility of self discovery or growth whereby, to quote Jung, we can \"acknowledge one's self for what one by nature is, in contrast to that which one would like to be.\" 6 Still, this does not negate the bulk of what as­trologers have written. Rather, I am simply trying to inform the weary traveler, whose life is but a sojourn in this strange land, that there are many divergent teachings which hold specific pieces to the puzzle of self exploration. No single art contains it all; modem astrology included. We know that humanity unconsciously taps into a vast collective unconscious or reservoir of all the knowledge and experiences of our species.

Ironically, irrespective of where they may be situated, most cul­tures are saying the same thing, if from a different point-of-view. It is easy to determine that whilst in one situation a particular belief might be twisted into something negative by local circumstance, in a dif­ferent context the same problematic conviction will be expounded with clarity and grace. Astrological teachings are also rooted in the col­lective unconscious ofhumanity, and dependent upon the school of thought to which the astrologer adheres and are also filled with the accrued contradictions of centuries of interpretations. It is not my intention either to question or to de­fend the beliefs of the ancient cultures that portrayed the stars and planets as actual Gods who ruled over the various processes of Nature, as a mundane King might rule over his subjects. My sympathies in that regard are firmly with Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), who-when pondering the possible influences of the Gods on occult matters-observed: \"It is im­material whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.\" 7 I believe 7.

Of course Jung clearly did not consider planetary forces to be actual living entities. He wrote that: \"As­trology, like the collective unconscious with which psychology is concerned, consists of symbolic con­figurations: the planets are the gods, symbols of the power of the unconscious.\" 8 In other words, he saw the Gods of ancient astrological mythologies repre­senting influences behind archetypes originating in our collective unconscious. To explain, Jung wrote: \"The collective unconscious appears to consist of mythological motifs or primordial images, for which reason the myths of all nations are its real exponents. In fact the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious. We can see this most clearly if we look at the heavenly constellations, whose originally chaotic forms are organized through the projection of images. This 8.

In the course of this book I plan to draw upon numerous ancient myths and beliefs in the hope that some of might shed a light of understanding on the foundations of the rather dif­ficult topic of astrology. In their discussions of astrology members of the scientific community often deride the art and deny the possibility of a planet or other celestial object hav­ing any affect upon the life-pattern of an individual. Some astrologers on the other hand maintain that you cannot scientifically analyze the invisible astral pull which celestial objects have upon us because they are too subtle. In this instance, the scientific community is probably closer to the truth; the planets have little or no influence upon us, although many astrologers, not really knowing the fundamentals of their own art, like to babble a seemingly un-provable defense. 9.

It is clear from Carl Jung's theories on ar­chetypes that he, too, grasped this concept firmly. Aleister Crowley has given us a profound piece of wisdom concerning the next step to the correct com­prehension of astrology when he wrote: \"A proper understanding of the planets, and indeed of the Universe itself, is only to be obtained by a knowledge of the doctrine of correspondence between the micro­cosm and the macrocosm.\" 10 To appreciate what he suggests we must return to one of the more unlikely of sources, the ancient mystical tradition known as Qabalah. One of its most well-known symbols is the Otz Chiim (t:l''n;, fl7), or the Tree of Life. It is iden­tical to the Tree of \"Knowledge\" of both \"Good & Evil\" and by eating its fruit we can obtain Gnosis or Hidden Knowledge of the Universe and, more impor­tantly, ourselves. This symbol represents everything, both above and below, both externally and internally. In modem times it has become a very favorable filing 10.

INTRODUCTION xvii system for the expectations of magicians. At first Judaic lore did not have a specific diagram of the Tree of Life. Early Qabalists placed all spiritual references, like the ten spheres or Sephiroth (nii'tlO), upon the back-side image of a giant heavenly man whom they referred to as Adam Kadmon. Originally there were no paths uniting these \"Spheres.\" This back-side image of Adam Kadmon not only referred to God, whose face was thought so powerful that no mortal could behold it and live, but was also the pri­mordial man or the image behind the germ of all cre­ation. A second or identical image was drawn upon the lesser Adam or the first human being created in the image of God. The ancient Greeks referred to these two concepts in a more fluid undefined fashion as the microcosm and macrocosm. The term macrocosm is from the Greek phrase makros kosmos (MaKpo KOcrf.!oc;) or ··greater world.\" This can be read as referring to the Tree of Life as symbol of our Universe, the Heavens above and the entirety of God's Kingdom. It is the objective universe and those things outside our body and, in a sense, it is the primordial Adam. The word microcosm is from the Greek mikros kosmos (MtKpo KOcrf.!oc;) or \"little world\" which can be interpreted as referring to the Tree of Life symbolically found in each one of us. This Tree not only reflects our mun-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xviii ALETHEIA dane body and all its functions but is also a map of our human consciousness and spirituality. This is the image of the lesser Adam. Both Trees are identical or mirror images of each other. It is said that God used the exact same blueprint to create everything from the most exalted to the most insignificant, and that to study any part thereof on one Tree will reveal, simply by analogy, an identical fundamental principle on the other Tree. In other words, what is found on one Tree must be found on the other and to know one Tree is to know both; thus the fundamental principle of all magick: \"As Above, So Below.\" Realizing this, astrologers must stop referring to actual heavenly objects as the source of influence rather than universal movements that are a \"reflection\" of what is occurring internally within our own Universe, or around our inner Sun. Dane Rudhyar is of similar opinion, and further comments: \"It is not that the planets 'influence' directly any particular person by flashing a special kind of a ray which will make the person happy or cause him to break his leg. The cycles of the planets and their relationship represent to man reality in an ordered state and in reference to the 'greater whole' which we know as the solar system.

It is equally important to realize that even if you are a lowly turtle functioning off the lowest Qabalistic sphere of Malkuth (mJ'nJ) or Earth (i.e. our human body), the entire Tree of Life is still found within your self and it must manifest \"all\" of its qualities in varying degrees every day in a continual struggle called Life. Yet arguably, as shown by our astrology chart, not every part of the Tree can manifest through this shell that we call the human body. Contrary to what some magickal fraternities might have you be­lieve, everyone does not have the same capabilities to traverse the internal Tree sphere by sphere. The importance of our Birth Chart is that it indi­cates both our strong points and the pitfalls that await us upon the Tree of Life. It shows us the first step that is required in the voyage of self discovery and it teaches us an important lesson as to the role our body 11. Dane Rudhyar, The Pulse of Life.

This book is the distillation of a lifetime of reflec­tion on a very complicated subject. Some may see it as provocative in that unlike many \"conventional\" works on astrology it presupposes an acceptance of reincarnation; that is that our Spirits are engaged in a continuing cycle of birth, life and death as they move from one incarnation to the next in order to gain the experiences they need. We are all wandering heirs to a lost inheritance and our astrological Birth Chart can give us clues as to why we incarnated in our present forms. This book is designed to help you find and interpret those clues. It is not, however, a book that will spell every­thing out for you. While it should serve as a guide, it also requires your own effort and input. To this end the volume has been made deliberately small, so that it can be readily to hand for quick and easy reference.

In early times the idea of a spirit being reborn again and again played a much greater role in society than it does today. In fact, during the first five hundred years after the death of Christ reincarna­tion was a well-respected part of Christian faith but around 5 50 AD this belief, along with that of astrology itself, fell out of favor with Christianity. Those who disagreed with the Church's new viewpoint soon found themselves labeled heretics. Then, after a few hundred more years, Christians become accustomed to accepting as true that they had but one life to live, and that when this was over they were destined either to Heaven or a Hell. This belief greatly influenced the way in which people interpreted the art of astrology as it slowly reemerged back into society during the �iddle Ages."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2 ALETHEIA Greek astrological thought had a great influence on early Christian beliefs on reincarnation. In Book 8 ofhis Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers Diogenes Laertius (c. 3'd Century) states that \"Pythagoras was reported to have been the first of the Greeks to teach the doctrine that the spirit passing through the \"circle of necessity\" was bound at various times to various living bodies.\" Pythagoras died in 572 Be. The Greek philosopher Plato (427 Bc-347 Be) would later discuss the \"circle of necessity\" and reincarnation in his classic work The Republic. There he referred to the heavens as a giant spindle of eight \"whorls\" or rings; the outer of which was believed to be that of the \"Fixed Stars,\" followed by Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, the Sun and finally the Moon. Plato used his understanding of cosmology and as­tronomy to create the concept of a heavenly \"spindle\" as a means of explaining how known celestial bodies revolved around the Earth or the central hub. Plato termed this image \"The Spindle of Necessity.\" It is named after Ananke (AvayKTJ), the ancient Goddess ofNecessity. She was born of no parents, self-formed, having existed since the very beginning of time. Her outstretched arms encompassed the breadth of the entire universe. It was on her knees that the giant spindle rested."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"lftuence on look8ofhis :sDiogenes agoras was b to teach 1 the \"circle 11o various ·The Greek Iller discuss this classic be heavens 15; the outer iD:d Stars,\" II)', Venus, ggyandas­r\"spindle\" lltial bodies :bub.

She had three daughters or Fates who sit upon Thrones and oversee each \"Thread of Life\" or new incarna­tion which their mother spins. They watch on as their mother turns the wheels to and fro, aligning the planets perfectly to fit our new incarnation. It was believed that these Fates then cut the thread at the precise moment in \"time\" when we are ready to be born, which stops the spindle. Examining the spindle gives us our Birth Chart of the heavens; which is little more than a personal road map of where we came from, where we're going and of our stops in-between. The Greeks referred to this as our Lot in Life. The term \"zodiac\" is most likely derived from the Greek phrase zodiakos kyklos or scpotaK6c; Kl)l<Aoc; which means a \"circle of animals.\" This might seem confusing since classical astrology clearly portrays some signs like Aquarius, Libra, Virgo and Gemini, in human form. However, modem man tends to for­get that human beings are also animals. Be that as it may the Greek word for animals (zodiakos) in Latin became zodiacus which in tum became the English word \"zodiac.\" One's birth map of the zodiac is properly known as a \"horoscope.\" This is essentially nothing more"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4 ALETHEIA than a scientifically determined chart that records the location of astronomical objects within certain con­stellations at the moment of your birth.

Our Horoscope or birth cart is almost always drawn in a circular fashion similar to a mandala, a Sanskrit word which is loosely translated as a \"cir­cle.\" It is important to understand the significance of both images. Marie-Louise van Franz once wrote that a mandala \"represents an ultimate oneness of inner and outer reality,\" suggesting that it is a model for the organizational unity of both the microcosm and the macrocosm.12 Meditating on the sacred space of a mandala we come to realize that, as with our Birth Charts, the mandala is a cosmic diagram meant to jog our memories of our relationship with the Universe, 12.

Carl Jung clearly understood this and repeatedly identified the image of a mandala as representing our unconscious or hidden self that is reminiscent of one's Birth Chart. The art and science known as \"astrology\" is that of learning to interpret the influences that these as­tronomical objects have on one another in order to understand a life so chosen. The word is derived from the GreekAstron (a<rrpov) or \"star\"; and Logos (1.6yoc;) \"Word\" which implies that astrology is the specific teachings of the \"Word of the Stars.\" In an­cient times astronomy and astrology were not consid­ered as separate arts. Only when astronomy emerged as a \"scientific\" study of astronomical objects did it begin distancing itself from that which it saw as mere speculation of the same phenomena but, in truth, both methods consist of collecting data through observa­tion and then formulating a hypothesis. In the course of this exploration of the art of as­trology I will often make reference to the works of Aleister Edward Crowley. In 1898, at the age of 23, Crowley joined the magickal fraternity in London known as The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn; and took the magickal motto of Perdurabo-\"I Shall Endure.\" He studied and practiced ceremonial magick"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6 ALETHEIA and astrology all his life; the press dubbed him the \"wickedest man in the world\" but he preferred his own titles of the \"Master Therion, the Great Beast 666.\" There is no certainty as to who instigated the process, but in 1916 Crowley began \"ghost-writing\" some works for Evangeline Adams on the subject of astrology. Evangeline Adams (1868-1932), was one of the best known astrologers of her day. Her work went on to become a foundation stone for many modem astrologers, yet few outside Thelemic circles realize that her well-known texts, Astrology, Your Place In The Sun (1927) and Astrology, Your Place Among The Stars (1930), were for the most part writ­ten by Aleister Crowley.

Scholars have spent centuries trying to perfect a translation of the phrase, which is most frequently given as: \"Man's Character is his Fate.\" In other words; who we are is predetermined by the type of character in which we chose to incar­nate. Yet I must point out; astrology clearly informs us that our travels in this body are not carved in stone; nor are they delegated by Fate and the stars. We have \"Free Will\" and if you fail to understand this principle then astrology will make little sense. In this respect Crowley further explains, \"It should be Thelema\" (p. 553). I do not agree with this assumption. Although little seems to have been recorded concerning Adams' early education, we do know that she left her \"sec­retarial job\" to pursue astrology full time and seems unlikely to have had anywhere near the breadth of knowledge of the Cambridge-educated Aleister Crowley. The author of \"Free Will Versus Destiny\" quotes the Greek philosopher Heraclitus; then the poem \"lnvictus\" by the British poet William Henley (1849-1903), William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Charles Fleischer's \"Essay on Human Nature,\" and even John Dryden's (1631-1700) classic poem \"Tyrannick Love.\" Surely of the two individuals, Crowley was the one most likely to have been familiar with these sources, and is therefore the author of the piece."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"8 ALETHEIA clearly understood that the stars only indicate what will come to pass if intelligence and Free Will are 14 not used to change the natural course of events.\" In other words; our astrological Birth Chart offers us a glimpse at the foundation stones of our incarnation or the basic character on which our life is to be built. We can look at our chart and see our body type, our health, all our potentials for family, friends, wealth and our capabilities to succeed and even our limita­tions. However, as Crowley clearly states in the same paper: \" ... how far we shall develop the desirable traits and overcome those which are undesirable, depends upon the exercise of Free Will.\" Author and mystic Manly Palmer Hall (190 1-1990) elaborated upon this theme when he wrote, \"Philosophically speaking, that man who does not rule himself is ruled by fate, even as a ship without a helmsman is at the mercy of the sea.\" 15 Put simply, if you walk up to a soaring cliff and jump you'll plum­met downward to your doom, but up to the moment when you leaped you still had free choice. After you've jumped we can assume it to be your Fate; or as Manly Palmer Hall puts it-\"Free-willleaves off 14. Evangeline Adams, Op. Cit, p. 337. 15.

Free Will is the foremost reason why astrology is a difficult science to pin-point. If you get five people who were born on the same day, even the same time and place, they can be as different as night and day depending upon which persons are still pawns to the powers that be; or metaphorically which ones are still slaves in contrast to those who exercise Free Will. This determination is based on the foundation that we were given by different circumstances at birth. Knowing this, do scientists care to study astrology correctly? �o. Most would rather point out one specific incident of an astrologer's recklessness as an example of fraud tor the entirety of the science rather than using their skills to analyze the art properly. Crowley makes a ,-ery keen observation when he writes: \"Astrologers sometime make mistakes.

Early Greek philosophers understood this folly because one of the most important questions that preoccupied them was whether humans are endowed with Free Will, or are instead subject to a preordained order of events in each new incarnation. Most be­lieved that the answer was woven around what we term Fate, an obligatory decree given to us by God that predetermines the course of our life; the guiding rules of which are depicted in our Birth Chart. But the ideas behind Fate should not be seen as an expla­nation of why certain things happen, or if something happened, or why it had to be. Instead this decree of Fate, which in the modem \"magickal\" sense is called our True Will, is merely the underlying reason behind the desired experience of an incarnation. However, fulfilling this mandatory pronouncement, like the ideas behind Fate itself, is not something carved into stone.

They also believed that we had free choice to pick and choose whether or not to perform the rites, or even to do them well or poorly. This was the paradox of Fate or destiny. On the one hand life was said to be predetermined. On the other hand, by our own feeble actions, we could clearly influence our incarnation to either occur as planned, or curse ourselves for all eter­nity for the blunders we invoked through free choice. Greek philosophers believed that the Gods them­selves realized this dilemma. Plato wrote about this subject in \"The Myth of Er,\" which concludes his book The Republic. The story begins with a warrior named Er, who had died in battle. Ten days after his death, when all the bodies were being collected, Er's body was found unaffected by decay and later he 3L'\"tllillly awoke on his funeral-pyre. He then recounts the saga of his journey through the afterlife and what he had seen in the other world.

In the story some of the Spirits felt compelled to satisfy their thirst more than others and the more they drank, the deeper they slept and it was in this slumber that they forgot their divine heritage. In the middle of the night there was a great thun­derstorm and a mighty earthquake, and in an instant the sleeping Spirits were driven upwards to their birth, like shooting stars. The Gods also knew that once a Spirit had attached itself to a new body it would be­come difficult, if not impossible, for it to remember why it had chosen a particular Fate let alone to fulfill its given decree or True Will. As Plato wrote,\" ... we are imprisoned in the body, as in an oyster-shell,\" and once so confined, the waters of Lethe indiscriminately wash clean \"all\" memories.18 To alleviate this dilemma of forgetfulness the Gods gave all mankind two priceless gifts. According to Plato the first gift is that our Spirit was allowed a leisurely preview of \"samples of lives,\" referred to as \"lots.\" In a modem sense the term \"lot\" can best be understood by the phrase \"it is your lot in life\" as if Fate or luck made it so. The Latin word for \"Lot\" is Sors which is also the name for the Roman God of Luck. The Greeks believed that every possible type 18.

In other words, it was believed that re­incarnation was meant to temper our Ego-personality in an Alchemical furnace in order to bring our Soul to a greater realization of good through all experiences, including evil: \"anima inter bona et mala sita.\" 19 This idea evolved into a far more intricate system in later neo-Platonist thought. Instead of the Spirit merely reviewing a multitude of pre-determined lives, it actually took the responsibility of preparing a suit­able foundation at birth which would enable it to un­consciously live the decree of the Gods.20 The Greeks believed that the Spirit had to select everything from 19. \"Anima inter bona et mala sita,\" that is \"Soul placed be­tween good and evil.\" Carl Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, Bollingen Series, Volume 14, 1977), p. 6. 20. Another myth to consider is that found in The Tibetan Book of the Dead, whose actual title is \"The Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Intermediate State or Bardo Thodol.\" Many believe this work is that of the legendary Padma Sambhava who lived in the 8th century A.D. In brief; the book acts as a guide for the dead in the underworld. In the third stage known as Sid-Pa Bardo the spirit observes hundreds of couples copulating whom it is to consider as future parents.

Everything, from the most to the least important detail, was predeter­mined. Crucially, the Spirit also picked the type of parents that it would need, in accordance with their personal astrological influences or Birth Charts, as these would play a major role in shaping its personal­ity prior to puberty. When it reached this time oflife it was believed that, to borrow a phrase from Crowley, the Spirit was to be given the free choice to \"Do what thou wilt.\" Once the Spirit had reviewed its previous incarna­tion, and had also chosen a desired \"lot\" that would enable it to learn from past mistakes while gaining insights from new experience, it was then able to se­lect the perfect time and location on Earth that would best make it all possible. Put differently: the Spirit was ready to choose its Birth Chart. Then, even if it drank gluttonously from the River of Forgetfulness, the clues to its new incarnation would never be lost due to the fact that they were recorded in the Stars.

Reviewing the Birth Chart in the Spindle she then presents a Second Gift, because the Gods, who initially gave us our True Will in the form of a mandatory decree, admittedly do not have the time to interfere in our affairs in order to help us fulfill it. This Second Gift is called the daimon (Oatf.toY) and it is akin to a personal \"guardian spirit.\" It is what some religions call the Holy Guardian Angel. It v.·as considered neither human nor divine; almost el­emental in form. In regards to each individual, Plato informs us that this entity was to be \"a guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice;\" the choice being the incarnation so chosen.21 One of the earli­est mentions of the daimon is found in The Golden Jerses of Pythagoras.

Thus it was originally a generic term of reference for any entity within the \"middle region\" (Metaxu), which actually translates as a bridge, or an intermediate realm. The actual location of this region has always been hotly debated but, in truth, it is neither our conscious world of perceptions nor is it the deep 22.

It is said that the daimon functions within this realm in order to act as an intermediary between the Gods and mankind. It is everyone's internal voice, the tenuous something which chatters inside our head, which does not ap­pear to anyone else, but only to the thinker himself. Although the daimon can be malefic, it is not neces­sarily so, nor is it essentially a wicked or an evil inhu­man entity. In truth, the daimon is considered neutral. It is neither male, nor female but both at the same time; pure energy, it is the seed of All possibilities. Lachesis had summoned a daimon in order for it to assume the responsibility in helping the Spirit to understand and accomplish the type of incarnation which it had selected. Whether or not such a calling or life was to be bathed in a reality \"good or bad\" is immaterial to the daimon. The daimon 's job is simply to bring our Spirit to the accomplishment of its True Will, meaning the type of \"experience\" that it had chosen prior to birth. In doing this, it should give us the ability to learn and discern between good and evil. The philosopher Socrates (470 sc-399 sc) admit­ted to having such guidance in a form of a voice which often whispered to him \"no\" when he was about to commit some folly.

They form the medium of the prophetic arts, of the priestly rites of sacrifice, initiation, and incantation, of divination and of sorcery, for the divine will not mingle directly with the human, and it is only through the mediation of the spirit world that man can have any intercourse, whether waking or sleeping, with the gods. And the man who is versed in such matters is said to have spiritual powers, as opposed to the mechanical pow­ers of the man who is expert in the more mundane arts.\" 24 Astrologically, the origin and nature of our dai­mon is determined by the \"Sun behind our Sun\" or the central star in the constellation that we have 24.

In other words, Lachesis summons our guardian spirit from our chosen Zodiac sign and then brings it through the Sun in our own Solar System downward into our bodies. Because of this Lachesis is the Fate which is said to rule the Sun in our Birth Chart. Neo-Platonist philosophers like Iamblichus (245 AD-325 AD) later defined the daimon as anAugoeides (Auyo£t8cc;). The word is a combination of two Greek words; auge, meaning a bright light and eidos, which implies the light of a given Star has taken form or shape. The Greeks described the Augoeides as be­ing celestial light clothed in the essential form of its host. Originally it was believed that this entity never entered into the human body but remained nearby on a spiritual plane in order to shed its \"radiance\" as a guide for the inner man. However, the concept evolved into the belief that the Augoeides not only takes on the essential form of our own mortal body but it is so attached to us, or wrapped around our body like a suit of clothes, that it is forced to mimic our every movement while whispering in our ears. This is why the daimon requires a symbiotic relationship with our Zodiac birth sign in order for it not to be in conflict with our chosen incarnation.

Her name means \"spin­ner.\" It is she who reviews our astrological Birth Chart and is in charge of \"ratifying the destiny of each\" individual. 25 However, I must again remind you, the precise actions of our incarnation are never carved in stone; only the fact that we have chosen a \"specific incarnation\" or life linked to a particular Birth Chart, and according to Klotho it is now ours to fulfill and no one else's. She is the Fate who rules the Moon in our Birth Chart. This orb has no light of its own but reflects that of the Sun; or the incarnation that we have chosen. In other words, Klotho creates a foundation in which our Spirit shall perceive the world and she calls this foundation our Soul. The concepts of both Spirit and Soul have become entwined throughout the centuries and it is often dif­ficult to distinguish the role of each but if we take away all the religious clutter the two aspects become relatively easy to understand. Our Soul is the lowest quality-tethered to the human body-ofthat divine spark known as the \"Spirit.\" In other words, both are rooted deep within; they are one and the same and inseparable.

The Soul, on the other hand, is the conscious or animating force of our Spirit which utilizes the human body in order to gain an experience through incarnation and it is also our unconsciousness, our dream world and all other areas where the fine line of reality is not so clearly defined. In many respects we can say that our Soul is the \"point-of-view\" of our Spirit rather than an actual independent quality; it is merely the tool of \"percep­tion\" which allows the Spirit to be reflective of its surroundings in order to function. According to the ancient Greeks, it is possible to lose our Soul through the exercise of our free will; thereby losing our way and meaning that we are no longer able partake of the experiences that we had chosen as necessary for our incarnation.

It is Atropos who not only chooses the manner of our death but when. She does this by looking over the thread of life or incarnation that we have chosen and cutting it at an appropriate length with \"her abhorred shears\" thus giving us our horoscope which in theory is the sum total of our incarnation from beginning to end. It is extremely important to understand the legacy of this mythology regarding the Fates. It not only explains our Birth Chart but it also plays an impor­tant role in understanding modem magickal theory in regards to our Spirit's travels through birth, life and death.

It is the heavi­est, slowest, and dullest of all types of energy and because of this quality it can be likened to the Fate Atropos who binds our Spirit into our body. At this juncture it is relevant to make the point that in ancient Greece the human body was considered a tomb that could easily ensnare our Soul if we were not careful. Within the spine there is a subtle, invisible chan­nel known as a Nadi; which translates as a \"tube\" but more usefully can be described as a \"flow\" of energy rather than the object wherein the energy flows. Nadis are found throughout our body. The most important is called the Sushumna. It lies within our spinal column. The Serpent Kundalini is said to remain dormant at the base of this channel until she is awakened, and then slowly moves upward. Along the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26 ALETHEIA way she embraces subtle centers known as Chakras, a word which translates as a \"Wheel,\" and is broadly similar to the Judaic beliefs of the Sephiroth (m1'�0) on the Tree of Life. The lowest Chakra of seven is known as the Muladhara or Root Chakra. It is said to be located at the base of the spine in the vicinity of the coccygeal plexus beneath the sacrum. The \"lotus\" or flower of this Chakra has four blood-red petals and within the center of the petals is a yellow square. Metaphorically the \"division of four\" refers to many things; like the four elemental forces of air (Vayu), fire (Tejas), water (Apas) and earth (Prithivi); earth being the most dy­namic within this particular Chakra. The petals also represent four psychological states of great joy which correspond to the bliss of realizing Godhood in our physical body; the Qabalistic Union with Kether (1n:l). This is the 1st sphere on the Tree of Life often referred to as the Crown. The actual nature of these four spiritual states varies dependent upon the school of thought, but most agree that the higher states refer to spiritual longing, the next psychic long­ing, then physical longing and finally, the longing for spiritual liberation. On the lowest level, when a per­son functions solely out of the 1 01h sphere known as Malkuth (mJl.m) or in his or her body, the four states refer to their survival instincts and their ability to On D�No' __ I function in the immediate pi Here then the four petals relll body, our possessions, our a ers, and our home life and illl Within the sacred ye1181 lotus of the Muladhara is 1 is often depicted as an in an elephant in the center. n that the Chakra is the subda the elephant-headed God 0.

This alludes to the belief that the Chakra is the subtle abode or doorway for the elephant-headed God Ganesha, the son of Lord Shiva. Like Kundalini, when Ganesha moves he is known as the Lord of Beginnings, he is the Initiator, or one who begins. The inverted Red Triangle is also a sacred symbol found within the Second Degree ofAleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis but prior to obtaining this degree a candidate must first undergo two primary initiations: Minerval (0°) and First Degree (1°). Minerval initia­tion is named after the Roman Goddess of Wisdom or Minerva. The initiation occurs in the 2nd Qabalistic sphere on the Tree of Life called Chokmah (:-Jo:m); which means Wisdom. In this initiation, according to Aleister Crowley, both the Muladhara Chakra and Anja are activated simultaneously in order to prepare our Spirit to descend into the Flesh. Carl Jung made reference to the \"interchange\" of these two chakras in his musings on Kundalini yoga as far back as 1932."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28 ALETHEIA In Tantric teachings our Spirit is not that hard to understand. It is referred to as the Goddess Sakti. In a Qabalistic sense She is a \"feminine\" quality in all of us which lies above the Abyss on the Tree of Life.

This is the reason why the Minerval initiation of o. T.O. activates these two states, or Chakras: the Anja and the Muladhara.

The time spent is symbolic of the Spirit marching through \"the land of the dead.\" Then, in preparation for First Degree which occurs in Binah (;-tJ�:J), a candidate symbolically encamps \"by the River of Lethe which literally means the River of Forgetfulness.\" In the ac­tual initiation rites of First Degree o.T.o. the River of Lethe, like the four-sided square depicted in glyphs of the Muladhara, is symbolized by a Sacred Well. This Well also represents the human womb through which a candidate is prepared for birth and through which he or she is born into the world . The Muladhara Chakra is identified with the 9th Qabalistic sphere known as Yesod (110�). This is the Dark Mother, or the Moon on the Tree of Life. While the Sun's significance with our Spirit is well known, the Moon's importance with our Soul is rarely un­derstood.

But most candidates drink too heartily from the sacred waters of forgetfulness within the Sacred Well and few if any know how to look for Aletheia, or Truth. Most, thinking themselves now a First Degree initiate, will ignore the lessons of the Minerval in order to focus on where they now stand and hence the \"forgetful­ness\" ofTruth begins. One is also reminded of the primeval Goddess Ananke (AvayKll); who is said to be serpentine, twist­ing her snake-like body around the whole of creation as her three daughters or Fates; Lachesis, Klotho and Atropos sit upon Thrones (coils). Each of these Fates oversee a \"Thread of Life\" which their mother spins for the Soul's new incarnation while it is walking around the Sacred Well. Symbolically on the Tree of Life our Spirit begins by entering through the Sun and it descends downward through the Middle Pillar. It is Lachesis who rules our Sun Sign. In Qabalah the Sun is ruled by the sphere known as Tiphereth (ni�!:ln) the 6th Sephiroth which means Beauty and here we must inevitably learn to seek the Laws of our Star for in Beauty is eternal Truth revealed. Klotho rules our Moon sign, Qabalistically ruled by the sphere known as Yesod (110'), the 91h Sephiroth. Klotho rules the pathway of Perfection where we must learn to con­quer or put under control our outer personality (i.e."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"32 ALETHEIA ego) in order to fulfill our desired experience. The third fate Atropos rules the Rising Sign or birth onto Malkuth (m::Jl;I7J), the 101h Sephiroth and She brings us Knowledge if only we have ears to listen in order to \"be true to ourselves\" as to why we are incarnating; this being our True Will. There are many misconceptions about the Kundalini; the most common of which is that she always sleeps and that only a spiritual person can awaken her. In truth, the Kundalini stirs daily, mov­ing serpentine up and down the spine as she assists us in embracing our Chakras or Sephiroth; which can either be a positive or negative experience. She awak­ens irrespective of whether a person is spiritual or not; for the Serpent, also known as \"Enlightenment,\" wakes daily seeking to snare its prey. In many re­spects Kundalini is not so much a part of us as She is an entity reminiscent of that which the Greeks called our daimon; She is a pure elemental force given to us by the Gods to assist us in our incarnation and our spiritual growth. As an objective entity She will leave us upon death and go back to her birth Star. When studying the Qabalah there are similar views about the activation of the Sephiroth. It teaches us that in order to function daily we require specific types of energy which each sphere contains, but rarely is the experience more than \"fleeting\"'i sphere to anodll every now and1 tional upheavali of self reflectia obtain an epiplll has bitten its pa Magicians Ill consciously in � often difficult 811111 is grave danger-i If the KundaliDi Chakra withoall mental disabililil often the feeble-� psychotic episod extreme to� individuals suJi:l bliss to extreme 1 bordering on sell analogy.

However, the Qabalah reveals that every now and then, due to a great spiritual or emo­tional upheaval in our lives, and often in deep moods of self reflection, \"Enlightenment\" strikes and we obtain an epiphany, or dare we say that the Serpent has bitten its prey in a specific Chakra. Magicians attempt to fully utilize each sphere consciously in quest of this Enlightenment. This is often difficult and can take years of practice but there is grave danger in doing this without proper training. If the Kundalini is incorrectly \"forced\" into a given Chakra without a proper foundation, physical or mental disabilities can easily afflict an individual and often the feeble-minded will be plagued by manic and psychotic episodes as the pendulum swings from one extreme to another. It is not uncommon to find such individuals suffering from periods of great elation or bliss to extreme anxiety and fear; often hallucinatory bordering on schizophrenia. Let's look at a simple analogy. If your psychic system were similar to twen­ty-two gauge wire, how much current could you draw before the wires burned out? Could it draw 100 amps? Of course not; a burnout would be inevitable. Without careful training through magick, yoga, or similar methods, most psychic systems will be ill prepared for any influx or surge of pure \"life current.\""},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"34 ALETHEIA George Arundale ( 1878-1945), the English the­osophist and once president of the Theosophical Society wrote, \"The path of occultism, it is said, is strewn with wrecks. I venture to think that the path of the arousing of kundalini, even if only in the first stages, is strewn with even more wrecks.\" 3° Carl Jung would agree. In his Introduction to The Tibetan Book of the Dead he writes, \"One often hears and reads about the dangers of Yoga, particularly of the ill-reputed Kundalini Yoga. The deliberately induced psychotic state, which in certain unstable individuals might easily lead to a real psychosis, is a danger that needs to be taken very seriously indeed. These things really are dangerous and ought not to be meddled with in our typically Western way. It is a meddling with Fate, which strikes at the very roots of human existence and can let loose a flood of sufferings of which no sane person ever dreamed.\"31 The problems occur when forcing the arousal of the Kundalini because of the possibility that some Chakras may have blockages which can hamper the flow of energy if ignored. The results are much like 30. G. S. Arundale, Kundalini, An Occult Experience (Adyar, Madras, The Theosophical Publishing House, 1938), p. 29. 31. From Carl G.

All Chakras are \"pure\" but our Birth Chart gives us an indication whether or not all Chakras are easily embraced due to the body that we've chosen in our present incarnation. Learning where our difficulties lie enables us to focus on the internal problems which might seem unfavorable and stressful; yet such blockages always occur due to an inharmonious aspect with another sphere's pull on the Tree of Life. Never is the sole re­sponsibility of one's success or failure based on one single sphere. It is important for the individual to fo­cus upon these \"opposites\" in an attempt to reconcile the two forces which appear to be pulling in different directions or at cross-purposes and which are hinder­ing us. Overcoming these obstacles can bring about spiritual growth but avoiding them shows where on the Tree of Life dangers lies for the individual.

In fact, our childhood is like a lump of clay of undetermined shape or pur­pose; out of nothing we came and from everything we are being formed. However at puberty we have just enough shape to be able to use the free choice to \"Do what thou wilt.\" In Alchemy this child-like lump of clay is a sub­stance often called ''prima materia.\" Some refer to the prima materia as a stone (1:::11'\\) on which all things are built; including the Temple of God; which is sym­bolized by a \"square.\" Throughout the centuries there have been hundreds of interpretations of what this primary matter constitutes of with no one definition considered prominent. Alchemists have always had a tendency to make their definition of prima materia more personal rather than towing a generic line. To understand the process by which the pri­mal matter is first molded one should consider the Ouroboros (Oupo�6po�) which is a name derived 37"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"38 ALETHEIA from oupop6po� 6qn� which means \"tail-devouring snake.\" As a symbol, the Ouroboros has multiple meanings interwoven into a single symbol of a snake eating its own tail in order to sustain its life. Those who are more perceptive recognize that the symbol actually implies self-reflection of \"opposites\" in order to produce change. It is the eternal cycle of re­newal found in the primordial Nature of the Universe. The Ouroboros in a sense is something constantly re-creating itself; creation out of destruction, life out of death. Carl Jung realized that the Ouroboros represented the classic pre-ego state of a child when the persona mask is first being formed; which is the fundamental mask that we'll wear for the rest of our life. It is clear to the more astute student that the al­chemists had discovered that the prima materia was man himself. In an astrological sense our Birth Chart represents the \"possibilities\" of the prima materia (or ourselves) as a lump of clay and the Ouroboros is the means by which our ego is being formed. To further understand these two qualities we must review our Lot ofF ortune along with the Nodes in our Birth Chart.

The Lot of Fortune is often referred to as an \"Arabic Part\" which has come to imply any imagi­nary point in one's Birth Chart which is computed through the addition and subtraction of three or more specific points. However, the term \"Arabic Part\" it­self is misleading and, as Dane Rudhyar has pointed out, \"The Exact origin of the system of Arabian Parts does not appear to be very well known. The system was presumably developed during the Middle Ages by the Arabs whose great culture was then emphasiz­ing mathematical concepts and geometrical arts.\" 33 It was John Gadbury (1627-1704) an English astrologer and a prolific writer of almanacs who most readily wrote on these Arabic Parts and established much of the foundation that we know on this topic.

Astrology later mutated with other cultural influences. Over time the term \"Lot ofF ortune\" became more commonly referred to as a \"Part of Fortune\" in Birth Charts. This made understanding the original concept difficult if not impossible for modem astrologers to understand but once you realize the Lot of Fortune's connection with the three Fates mentioned in Plato's \"The Myth ofEr\" it becomes fairly easy to appreciate what this symbol ® implies. As already discussed, there are three critical factors in every Birth Chart which determine our over-all incarnation. They are our Sun Sign, our Moon Sign and our Rising Sign. These three points refer to the Moirae or Fates· ' Lachesis (ruling our Sun Sign), Klotho (our Moon) and Atropos (our Rising Sign). It was these three Fates who ratified our chosen life after reviewing all the facts regarding our past, present and future; of birth, life, death and equally important, rebirth. When we mathematically correlate these three Fates or our Sun, Moon and Rising Sign into one single point we obtain our \"Part ofFortune\" or \"Lot of Fortune.\" The sign and astrological House into which the Lot of Fortune falls could be totally different from that of the Sun Sign but its importance should not be over­looked.

Equally important; it will give them an indication of what and how they shall make use of those things that have been given to them at birth. In other words, this is \"your over-all lot in life.\" Some modem astrologers simply refer to the \"Lot of Fortune\" as our Karma but this concept is very misleading because too often people mistakenly equate this term with \"penitence\" or something that we pay dues for regarding our past sins. Rather; after our Spirit has reviewed its past life it then picks a new incarnation in order to gain a new experience and to fulfill those things left unfinished in the previ­ous.

It is the \"hub of the spindle of Necessity.\" On the same subject, Dane Rudhyar wrote that the Lot of Fortune can be defined as \"the focal point for the expression of the power generated by the soli-lu­nar relationship.\"35 Although most astrologers agree with this statement, they all have different opinions as to what is meant by a balance between the Sun and the Moon, as well as on how both factors relate to the Rising Sign, which is their fulcrum. There are, of course, many ways to use your astrological chart and all methods are true, although each contains but a few pieces of the puzzle of your incarnation.

With that in mind, rather than being a pawn of powers that are affecting their daily lives they take an active role in seeking a more balanced and positive approach to the energies in play. This is where ritual magick is important. Once we establish where our Lot in Life lies, or our True Will, we can then set about doing rituals which are designed to tap into our Solar Current, which involves working with the Moirae or Fate Lachesis (who rules our Sun Sign) in order for her to help us receive guidance from the daimon (or Holy Guardian Angel) which she has given to us. To achieve this on the Qabalistic Tree of Life you must utilize elements of The Middle Pillar. Our Sun rules a Sephiroth (nii\"'�O) known as 6-Tiphereth (m��n) while our Moon rules 9-Yesod (110\"') which lies directly underneath it. Below Yesod on the Middle Pillar is 10-Malkuth (m:J?�J). When you examine the symbol for the Lot of Fortune® it is similar to that of our planet Earth EB. Both symbols refer to the same four-fold qualities.

The ritual of \"Liber Resh\" has four adorations that are to be said four times daily at sunrise, noon, sunset and midnight. Not only do they correspond to the cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth but they also tap into the four elemental tides or Tattwas of air, fire, water and earth which stream forth from our Sun at given times during each day. In greeting the Sun in the morning toward the east, one says, \"Hail unto Thee who art Ra in Thy rising, even unto Thee who art Ra in Thy Strength, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Uprising of the Sun. Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm. Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Night!\" A similar adoration is given to Ahathoor at noon in the south, to Tum at sunset in the west and to Khephra at midnight, facing the north. It is important to understand the basic symbol­ism behind this ritual. Resh is a Hebrew letter whose numerical value is that of 200. This is what the \"sub figura CC\" implies since C in Latin is the number 100 and thus CC is numerically 200. Of course Helios is Greek for the Sun. If you are familiar with Tarot Cards you will know that each of the 22 major trumps is ruled by one of twenty-two major Hebrew letters. The letter Resh rules the card known as \"The Sun,\""},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"46 A LETHE IA and astrologically this card is also ruled by the Sun itself. One should also know that the word Liber is Latin for book, thus \"Liber Resh\" is often referred to as \"The Book of the Sun.\" Aleister Crowley gives a brief breakdown of a few of the most obvious layers of this ritual when he writes: \"The Object of this practice is firstly to remind the aspirant at regular intervals of the Great Work; secondly, to bring him into conscious personal relation with the centre of our system; and thirdly; for advanced students, to make actual magical contact with the spiritual enerfly of the sun and thus draw actual force for him.\" 3 In other words; the magician is trying to fulfill his Lot of Fortune by making the body (Malkuth) and Soul (Yesod) a vehicle for the Sun (Tiphereth). Remember, the Muladhara is rooted in the sphere of Yesod, and that a \"Hidden Sun\" is said to dwell between its four petals which continually exudes a dangerous poison. This poison is known as the sun­fluid of mortality because he who eats of this nec­tar will surely die. It is Yesod, the sphere between Malkuth and Tiphereth, where our \"Will\" and Want\" first becomes pivotal. 36. Aleister Crowley, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, ed.

On the one hand it implies that we have been given the license to pursue our Earthly experience as we choose, but the danger of over-exercising this freedom is that our mercurial Soul, having passed the River ofForgetfulness, could easily focus all its attention towards Earthly \"do what thou wants\" that may unwittingly steer it away from the reason why it incarnated in the first place. Put differently, we have the choice either to embrace the Light of our Star in Tiphereth or droop down our head toward Malkuth and indulge in our \"wants.\" True magicians do not take the ritual ofResh non­chalantly because they understand what Crowley has stated that the third reason for its practice is to allow \"advanced students\" to \"make actual magical contact with the spiritual energy of the sun and thus draw actual force\" into themselves; i.e. their True Will. This is why Crowley warns us-\"Neglect never the fourfold Adorations of the Sun in his four stations, for thereby thou dost affirm thy Place in Nature and her Harmonies.\"37 37.

In truth, your Birth Chart has little meaning if not seen within a larger context of the past, present and the future. The Nodes are points at which the Moon's path around the Sun intersects the path of the Sun. They are respectively referred to as the \"Dragon's Head\" and \"Dragon's Tail.\" The Dragon in Alchemy is a complex symbol. It has wings, as if to suggest the spirituality of the prima materia, and in most al­chemical texts it appears both at the beginning and the end of the experiment. It is in affect, the same as the Ouroboros or the serpent which bites its tail uniting the opposites into a circle in order to produce change. Since the Nodes are always opposite each other on the body of the Dragon, logic dictates that they'll always be opposite each other in your Birth Chart. On that note; trying to understand one without reflecting upon the other is simply silly. They are Yin and Yang; inseparable.

This means that part of the energy is now directed inward, away from the world; hence the frequently used term \"backwards.\" Such qualities can give us a deeper sensitivity in regards to the planet and the house in which it falls. The Nodes offer us a glimpse or insight into what type of Karma we have accrued from our past life and of possibilities toward our future. Q North Node-Dragon's Head, or Caput Draconis in Latin, is when the Moon crosses the Sun's path from south to north in an ascending man­ner. It is considered positive, helpful and refers to one's present path or the Lot of Fortune that should be followed and carefully developed in order to fulfill one's future. It holds the possibility of good Karma that can be accrued in this life if inner balance is achieved. It is for this reason that some astrologers will tell you that the North Node is symbolic of your future but this is misleading and too broad. In truth, the North Node enables us to see the \"direction\" our Spirit wants to go and it informs us where we must strive."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"50 ALETHEIA In fact, the Head of the Dragon makes it clear where we literally wanted to \"head\" in this incarnation in order to achieve our \"Lot of Fortune,\" although the path may be made difficult by all the challenges and obstacles that we must face and overcome as depicted by our general Birth Chart. However; although we all have destinations, they can never be reached, for no matter how much we strive for betterment, there is always more to accomplish. To grasp the fundamen­tals of the North Node remember; it is in a specific sign and house. It has aspects that if understood will be your personal guiding North Star which only you should follow. It is the light at the end of the tunnel of your incarnation. e5 South Node-Dragon's Tail, or Cauda Draconis in Latin, is when the Moon crosses the Sun's path from north to south in a descending manner. This Node is considered negative and it is often seen as being unfortunate and hindering, although this is not an especially constructive way to consider it. Really, it just refers to the past and to the karma that we have accrued from our previous life, as well as those less positive things that have been carried over from our childhood (up to puberty) and into the present.

Your South Node is the \"af­fect\" that you are now experiencing because of past actions. The tail of the Dragon therefore represents the undesirable accumulated things which can thwart the head from moving forward by slowing the whole body down. If not addressed in this life, the folly of the tail will only be worsened in the next. In conclusion it can be said that the Dragon has many meanings interwoven into a single symbol of a creature in quest to bite its own tail, hence the two Nodes. They both require reflection on each other in order to produce change, and unless they unite into a circle-wherein lies the X which implies comple­tion-their dualistic energies cannot become one (Tao). In other words; if the Dragon bites its tail and holds on, all the different aspects of our Birth Chart start working and merging together in a fusion suggestive of the attainment of what the alchemists called the Philosopher's Stone."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"IV THE TREE OF LIFE Is CoNSTANTLY GROWING THE occult sciences, like all sciences, are ever­evolving as we push the threshold of our spiritual understanding toward new depths. Everything must be explored and expanded, including much that has previously been ignored or taken for granted. For instance, if one accepts that the Tree of Life repre­sents all-above and below, externally and internal­ly-and that every sacred art and science can be laid upon that glyph, then how does our Birth Chart fit onto it? This topic is rarely discussed, but if the Tree is a road map of everything that concerns our human selves, and our astrology chart indicates the heavens at the moment our Spirit entered therein, then there must be a correlation. But what is it? The symbol of the Tree ofLife has evolved greatly over the centuries, and a quick glance at the critical points of its development may help clarity the matter. Many people mistakenly think that the image that is found in most Qabalistic books is an ancient Jewish glyph but it is not.

Kircher attended the Jesuit College in Rome where he devoted himself to collecting in­formation from many different religions, observing the Universe, analyzing, synthesizing, interpreting and publishing what he believed to be other people's religious Truths. His books are filled with beautiful illustrations designed to make his points clearer. In one work, Oedipus Aegyptiacus ( 1652), he drew a glyph of the \"Sephirothic System\" on a Tree of Life as he had ascertained it to be from the Hebrews. His drawing clearly shows three columns, made up of ten spheres, which he then connected to one-another us­ing twenty-two paths of his own devising. To each of these connecting paths he attributed a Hebrew letter. Later Hebrew Qabalists embraced Kircher's design as being an accurate portrayal of God's Will, and over a period of time it has become an acceptable part of Judaic Mysticism. But most historians agree, it is Kircher's design that is the earliest rendition of the Tree of Life most readily used today. Prior to Kircher there were numerous designs of the Tree of Life showing a diverse number of paths and spheres; Kircher was responsible for developing the 22 Path system based on the 22 Hebrew Letters. It was during a resurgence of interest in the occult in the late 1700s that a most important foundation linking the Qabalah with the Tarot was established."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"54 ALETHEIA It began with such men as Antoine Court de Gebelin (?-1784), who published nine volumes between 1773 and 1782. He put forward the proposition that the earlier Tarot de Marseille, which was then simply being used as a card game, was in fact an arcane repository of timeless esoteric wisdom. He carefully laid out these theories in the eighth volume of his works, titled Monde primitif, analyse et compare avec le monde moderne ( 1 781 ). In the same book he also published an article written by the Comte de Mellet which makes the first known connection between the cards of the Tarot, the Hebrew letters, and the Qabalah. Like Gebelin, the Comte de Mellet used the term \"The Book of Thoth\" when referring to the Tarot; in recognition of his belief that the Tarot cards had a secret origin going back into they initia­tion chambers of ancient Egypt. The next major historical change to the Tree of Life took place thanks to a Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Alliette (1738-1791), more commonly known by the pseudonym, Etteilla. Some claim that Etteilla-who is said to have reversed the spelling of his real name, Alliette, because it sounded more \"mysterious\" -is the man directly responsible for making the Tarot and the Qabalah household words.

In the same year he also founded the \"Society oflnterpreters of the Book ofThoth,\" which is the very first organization that is known to have been exclusively devoted to the study of Tarot. Etteilla's legacy is a mixed one, and many of the symbols he used have become unpopular in occult teachings and have been abandoned. Still, Etteilla was the first person to publish a book with a method­ology for Tarot, titled Maniere de se recreer avec le jeu de cartes nomees Tarots (1785) and his later Cour theorique et pratique du Livre du That (1790) sparked the popularization and the further study of the Tarot by other occultists. In the end, whether you agree with his teachings or not, he was still truly a pioneer in occult teachings and practices and one of his major claims to fame is that he was the first to assign the zodiacal signs and Four Elements to selected cards. It could be said that the next major development in the area after Etteilla's work was that done by Eliphas Levi (181 0-187 5), who reinforced the connection between the Tarot and the Qabalah by drawing public attention to the link between the cards and the let­ters of the Hebrew alphabet. Although many other significant authors emerged during this period, it was arguably Levi's work that cemented the association of the Tarot in occult study and which became the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"56 ALETHEIA main model for the development and interpretation of the Tarot. Inevitably, considering that Kircher's Tree of Life had 22 paths which correlated to the 22 Hebrew letters, it was only a matter of time before the 22 major Arcanum of the Tarot, which now had Hebrew letters assigned to them, would become as­sociated to each path on the Tree of Life. While many astrologers are undoubtedly quite well versed in their trade, a number give no indica­tion of having an adequate understanding of their art in relationship to the Qabalistic Tree of Life.

The fifth sphere is known as Geburah (:111J:I) or \"Strength,\" the fourth sphere is called Chesed (ion) or \"Mercy\" and the third sphere is"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"60 ALETHEIA known as Binah (:-JJiJ.) which means \"Understanding.\" It is generally agreed that these three spheres rule the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn; this is not in dis­pute. These three spheres mimic our known Universe in that they, like the planets they rule, fall exactly in the same order stretching outward from our Sun to­ward the darkness of space. The conflict arises when we take the next three planets found beyond Saturn in our Solar System, which are Uranus, Neptune and Pluto and try to place them upon the Tree. We cannot dispute the astronomical order of these planets, but the confusion amongst Qabalists concerns which of the spheres after Binah-3 they rule. There are two possibilities: 1-Kether (Pluto) 2-Chokmah (Neptune) Daath (Uranus) 3-Binah (Saturn) Daath (Pluto) 1-Kether (Neptune) 2-Chokmah (Uranus) 3-Binah (Saturn) Aleister Crowley accepted the first arrangement as correct, but it is important to keep in mind that TJE1 when he begtll with regard tli information ., re-examinatiol place to start 11 Qabalistic attti First and i verse logic wtl apparent that J of ChokmaiL I evolves do� that the first 11 properly; KDOIII to emerge wid is a male phall ferred to as 1hll out of the dad! next sphere fiJI sphere whOJD, thus the origi woman in a .B and Mother-; and Binah (:11 other they pmll child is called Abyss) or� in regards to (j"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Jaderstanding.\" ipberes rule the is is not in dis­� Universe 1. fall exactly in DID our Sun to­lict arises when 1 beyond Saturn IS, Neptune and free.

A re-examination is therefore called for, and a sensible place to start would be Crowley's assessment of their Qabalistic attributes. First and foremost, the simple application of re­verse logic when studying The Tree of Life makes it apparent that Daath cannot come before the sphere of Chokmah. In the Qabalah we learn that the Tree evolves downward out of God or Nothingness and that the first sphere is Kether (The Crown) or more properly; Knowledge un-manifested. The next sphere to emerge within Creation is known as Chokmah. It is a male phallic-oriented \"Father\" sphere and it is re­ferred to as the \"Knower\" or he who extends himself out of the darkness in the quest to know things. The next sphere to be created was Binah; the \"Mother\" sphere whom Qabalists refer to as the \"Known;\" thus the origins of the phrase that \"I knew\" the woman in a Biblical sense. Next, when the Father and Mother-being Chokmah (;\"J�j:J;\"J) \"Wisdom\" and Binah (;,J�:J) \"Understanding\"-\"know\" each other they produce a child. This is basic Qabalah. The child is called \"Knowledge\" manifested (below the Abyss) or Daath and therefore logic asks the question in regards to Crowley's assumptions, \"How could a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"62 ALETHE!A child exist before either parent is fully formed in or­der to create it?\" Obviously Crowley is wrong in his hypothesis that after Binah-Satum (Mother) comes Daath-Uranus (Child), simply because the Father is nowhere to be found in the equation to assist with the creation of his Child. To further understand the problem we must scru­tinize both Daath and Uranus to determine if they are reflective of Crowley's hypothesis that they are one and the same. The God Uranus, also known as Ouranos (Oupav6�), was the embodiment of the heavens which were imagined by the early Greeks to be a solid dome ofbrass decorated with stars whose edges descend to rest upon the outermost limits of a fiat earth. Uranus is therefore known as the Sky God; the father of the Goddess Urania. Most ancient Greeks considered him to be primordial (protogenos) and they assigned no parentage to him, but simply refer to him as having emerged out of darkness. Of course, like all the Gods of Greek mythology, the character and features ascribed to him evolved over time, but we must discover if the most significant of these are best matched to either Daath or Chokmah. To begin with Chokmah is known Qabalistically as \"The Sphere of the Fixed Stars,\" which some refer to as the Zodiac but which more correctly refers to T..:1 all Stars; or d rules.

This sphere is also associated with our Spirit prior to birth; especially as portrayed in the Minerval initiation of o.T.o. This Degree obtains its title from Minerva; the goddess of Wisdom attributed to the sphere of Chokmah. It is said that this sphere gives us intuitive insights, like streaks of flashing lightning or epiphanies twinkling in our consciousness like stars in the heavens. This sphere reminds us of the outer ring of the \"Spindle of Necessity\" which lies just beyond Saturn. In Plato's The Republic this ring, like Chokmah itself, is said to rule \"fixed Stars,\" and therefore by logical extension it would seem that this Qabalistic sphere must rule the planet Uranus, and not Neptune, as Crowley assumed. The actual discovery of Uranus was announced by Sir William Herschel on March 13th 1781. Initially it had no name but the astronomer Jerome Lalande proposed in 1784 that the planet should be named Herschel in honor of its discoverer and he also suggested its astronomical symbol should be \"un globe surmonte par la premiere lettre de votre nom\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name\") which looks like 5. It was the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode (1747-1826) who argued that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"64 ALETHEIA Saturn, or Uranus. It seemed to fit rather nicely into the scheme of the Greek pantheon but the earliest official use of the name Uranus would not appear until after Herschel's death. Ironically another indication that Uranus is Chokmah and not Daath can be found in the writ­ings of Aleister Crowley himself. In 1909 he pub­lished a brilliant Qabalistic collection with the title Liber 777 Vel Prolegoma Symbolica Ad Systemam Sceptico-Mysticae Viae Explicande, Fundamentum Hieroglyphicum Sanctissimorum Scientiae Summae, based on material from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The numerous tables within it are still considered today to be one ofthe best guides to the hid­den interrelationship between all things and concepts from a Qabalistic perspective. Curiously-given his later stance-Crowley lists Uranus under the sphere of Chokmah in the listing of \"Some Greek Gods\" in Columm No. XXIV.38 Why he decided several years later that this was no longer valid astrologically has never been explained, but in so doing he erred. Simply, both in our Solar System and also on the Tree of Life, Saturn (Binah-3) comes after Uranus (Chokmah-2), it is quite straightforward; Mother and Father. 38.

The existence of Neptune was officially confirmed on September 23, 1846 by the French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier. Originally the planet was simply referred to as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le Verrier's planet\" and Verrier, claiming the right to name his discovery, wanted to name it after himself, as Uranus originally had been named after Herschel. However officialdom was inclined towards keeping with the mythological names of the other planets, and the name Neptune was certified for it in December 1846. Neptune was an Olympian God of the primordial oceans and seas. He is often depicted as an old man with a long flowing white beard. Like many Gods he underwent a transformation in character over the centuries. The planets astronomical symbol became '4! which is merely a stylized version of the trident that the God Neptune was reputed to always carry. The only problem with naming this planet Neptune was that it ignored the convenient precedent of giv­ing a new planet the name of the mythological parent of its predecessor, as had happened with Saturn and Jupiter. The father of Uranus was NOT Neptune, the latter being the son of Cronus or Saturn. But although"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"66 ALETHEIA the seemingly comfortable match of the planets with the Greek pantheon had gone off-track, it nonetheless seems as if somewhere deep within our psyche we understood it had to be so. Oddly, the understanding of these two planets set out in Crowley's astrological writings is quite accu­rate if applied to Chokmah and Kether instead of the spheres that he assumed they rule. It is as if he un­derstood the microcosmic qualities that are found in the lesser Adam, or within us, but intellectually went astray when looking at the macrocosmic Universe. There remains now that most mysterious of the Qabalistic spheres; Daath (m7i) or \"Knowledge.\" More myths have accrued about Daath than about the entirety of the Tree ofLife, with the study of the earli­est Qabalistic texts relating to the sphere revealing that many modem writers are guilty of\"confusing oranges with apples\" in their explorations of the subject. Astrologers, like magicians, should never forget that they are scientists. They must continually be on their guard against writers who have watched too many monster movies or read too much fic­tion and who want us all to run off and fight wind­mills.

In some ways we have to thank The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn for fostering the roots of this mis­conception. This Victorian fraternity, rooted deeply in Christianity, saw Daath simply as a False Crown or Head of a Serpent whose tail is in Malkuth while trying to claim divine heritage in the Heavens. The fraternity virtually never wrote about this sphere's dual aspect, bathed in good and evil, and it could be said that their speculations reveal more about them­selves than the sphere they ponder. First, let us consider that Daath is the child born through the Sacred Union of Chokmah and Binah. According to Verse No. 40 of \"The Book of Concealed Mystery\" of The Zohar, \" ... throughDaath, or knowledge, whereby wisdom is combined with the understanding, and the beautiful path with his bride the queen\" and \"Daath is itself the beautiful path.\"40 Further on in \"The Lesser Holy Assembly regarding Daath,\" Verse No. 297 states: \"And since He is called first-born, therefore it implieth dual offspring.\"41 40.

The Abyss is an imaginary desert of sand which lies across the top of the Tree of Life dividing the top three spheres from those below; it lies between Chesed (Jupiter-4) and Binah (Satum-3). Knowledge, being bathed in duality as a child born below the Abyss, can refer either to divine Gnosis (yvmmc;) or it can be a false Crown that is merely the spawn of Malkuthian thinking. As an example; if the magickal \"Oath of the Abyss\" is taken for egotistical reasons it is unjustifiable and it will no longer fulfill the True Will but the desires and Wants of the individual, and thus forces the magician to fall back to Malkuth. All his knowledge (Daath) then becomes \"false.\" We do know that Daath is a doorway into the un­derworld but modem psychologists, like Carl Jung, were quick to point out that in the microcosm this realm is merely our subconscious. The question to ponder is not whether or not Daath is an entranceway to good or evil, but rather whether it is something simply being perceived from the point of view of the proclivities of the person viewing it from below the Abyss on Malkuth.

As a God, Pluto is well known as the Lord of the Underworld. His name is derived from the Greek Plutous (ITA-ou'Wc;) which means \"wealth\" and it is believed that the Romans named him thus because metals, jewels and other riches lie in the underworld within the Earth. Some mythologies have Pluto be­ing the Son of Cronus or Saturn, which Qabalistically makes perfect sense. In the 1840s Verrier was able to predict the posi­tion of the then undiscovered planet Neptune after mathematically analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus, which was presumably being affected by the pull of another body somewhere in the Solar System. Subsequent observations of Neptune caused astrono­mers to speculate that Uranus' orbit was also being disturbed by another planet-which became known as \"Planet X.\" The task of uncovering the details of Planet X was given to a 23 year old American astron­omer name Clyde William Tombaugh ( 1906-1997) working out of Lowell Observatory, who pinpointed the planet in February 1930. The right to name the new planet was allotted to Lowell Observatory, who on March 241h, 1930, officially proclaimed it \"Pluto.\" Its original symbol was a combination of the letters P and L intended to reflect the initials of the founder"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"70 ALETHEIA of Lowell Observatory being Eercival Lowell (1855-1916) as well as the name Pluto itself. In time, most astronomers abandoned this symbol and began using l' which resembles Neptune with the central point being replaced by a circle. Irrespective of other factors, the planet's orbit is a good reason to associate Pluto with Daath. First, it is said that Daath doesn't really exist on the Tree of Life which has only ten \"Sephiroth\" and that Daath only comes into play when Binah and Chokmah unite to create this mysterious \"Eleventh Sphere.\" To il­lustrate this, it might be useful to envisage a Tree of Life turned on its side. Then enlarge the sixth sphere ofTiphereth (m��n), paint it in its proper Qabalistic color of bright yellow to reflect its Solar attribute and you'll clearly see our Sun with the Universe swirling around; mimicking the Above. Pluto is the only \"wild card\" in our Universe with an orbit which is markedly different from that of the other planets. All the planets orbit the Sun close to a fiat reference plane which is called the ecliptic and they have semi-circular orbits; similar to viewing the Tree of Life on its side. Pluto, on the other hand, is moving at an incline at over 17° relative to the eclip­tic orbits of the rest of our Solar System. Its orbit is referred to as being highly eccentric or elliptical.

However, the designation of the houses and house systems seem to have taken a long and obscure evolutionary road since the time of early Classical Astrologers. Still, there is a consensus amongst modem astrologers that each House represents a spe­cific function occurring throughout ones life and the overall chart describes the human journey from birth to death. Carl Jung has noted: \"The journey through the planetary houses, like the crossing of the great halls in the Egyptian underworld . . . signifies the overcoming of a psychic obstacle, or of an autono­mous complex, suitably represented by a planetary god or demon.

Those houses above the horizon are referred to as Yang while those below are called Yin. Some astrologers foolhardily say that these houses dictate positive and negative qualities that are reflective of one's life but it is important to understand, although Yin implies the negation of all positive qualities, it is not harmful as much as simply the exalted feminine which pervades all things; to compliment the Masculine Yang. They are the Sun and Moon; light and darkness. Other astrologers will tell you that the six houses below the horizon rule your unconsciousness, while those above rule our conscious thoughts but this is too simplistic. In truth, those houses below the horizon are simply more personal to us while those above the horizon 42.

Still, if one must label the Houses as being either internal or external it might be best to understand that the twelve Astrological signs are each divided into a mascu­line or feminine category. The Masculine signs are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius while the Feminine signs are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces. Carl Jung saw the bi­polar division of the signs in a different light than the average astrologer and he labeled them as reflec­tions of an \"extroverted\" (positive) and \"introverted\" (negative) quality as seen in our archetype. The dividing line between one house and another is called the cusp. Although it may seem like a simple 360° circle can be divided equally by twelve and interpreted accordingly, there are, in fact, over fifty systems of house division and quite a bit of contro­versy exists among astrologers as to which method \"works\" the best-or if, indeed, any of them work at all. Some astrologers ignore house system com­pletely on the grounds that most are too tainted by uncertainty to be used effectively. These astrologers follow the tradition of Claudius Ptolemy, the \"Father of Classical Astrology,\" who in his seminal work titled Tetrabiblos, appears to ignore the houses. Yes, it is certainly true that houses are purely a symbolic description of the over-all heavens, whereas the po-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"76 ALETHEIA sitions of the stars and the planets are measurable concrete things. Be that as it may, most astrologers accept the importance of a house system. It is believed that the Equal House system is the oldest of the house systems, and dates from the first century Be. In this system, each house is exactly 30 degrees, starting with the Ascendant as the cusp of the first house. Many astrologers in the United Kingdom and India use this house system, partly because as­trological schools in those countries have promoted this system. The most popular house system amongst astrologers is known as Placidus. It is named after an Italian monk named Placidus de Tito, a 17th century mathematician who because of his mathematical pro­clivities created one of the most complex astrological systems ever known to man. It is said to have first been mentioned around the 13th century in Arabic literature but the first confirmed publication of the system occurred in 1602, when Giovanni Antonii Magini (1555-1617) published it in his book Tabulae Primi Mobilis, quas Directionem Vulgo Dicunt. This system gained popularity in the 19th century due to its use in Raphael's ephemeris which first appeared in 1821. However, the most popular book available of \"house divisions\" in the 201h century was Joseph G. Dalton's Tables of Houses (originally published as The Spherical Basis of Astrology, 1893) which sup-� � .... alai IOak� SJ*I �­.... n � � the At isiiiDt lhe­aapfl •• IDD¥il! dewlll Placill Mi llm(J � asia� )'al\". ·� psydli ..."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"•able !)logers ll is the the first ictly 30 1pofthe ingdom �seas­tomoted amongst [after an (century iical pro­rological lave first n Arabic m of the i Antonii [Tabulae .,t.

In fact, it has be­come the definitive method with which most astrolo­gers are familiar but the mathematics that it uses to calculate the houses is bathed in folly because Dalton took liberties by simplifYing the entire mathematical system. Arguably, this means that most people today are not really using the original Placidus system, re­gardless of what they might think. The best way to understand Placidus is to rec­ognize the fact that, as a mathematician, Placidus devised an intricate system dividing the time it takes the Ascendant to reach the MidHeaven (MC) which is the point indicating the degree that is highest in the sky above the horizon at the place of birth, the cusp of the Tenth House. Some will argue that this is the natural approach to life; showing the Ascendant moving through time as the person is born, grows and develops and thus it explains the popularity of the Placidus system today. Another popular method is the Koch house sys­tem (pronounced \"coke\"). It was developed by Dr. Walter Koch in cooperation with H. Specht and oth­ers in the early 1960s and was published in 1971, a year after Koch's death. He died on February 251h 1970. During his lifetime Koch was a noted teacher, psychic, traditional astrologer, Tarot card reader and author. He was born on September 18, 1895 at"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"78 ALETHEIA 6:25am in Esslingen, Wiirttemberg, Germany. He studied at the University of Tiibingen (Ph.D., 1920), was scientific adviser to the Association of German Astrologers and leader of the investigative circle of the Cosmobiosophical Association in Hamburg. He served in the German army during World War I but was arrested by the Nazis in 1941 and spent three years in different prisons, including the infamous Dachau concentration camp. The Koch system, often referred to as the \"Birth Place House System,\" also uses the notion of time but instead of starting its calculations from the Ascendant as does the Placidus, its calculations begin from the MidHeaven (MC) and sweep downward clockwise. Arguably the main difference in the two systems is that the Ascendant is more important in the Placidus system while the MidHeaven is Key in the Koch. The way to understand and define the interpretational dif­ferences of Koch's system is to realize that magick­ally the human ego is dual in nature; rooted in the Qabalistic sphere known as Tiphereth (Sun) on the Tree of Life and is bathed in the Above and Below. Many astrologers will tell you that the Ascendant or First House rules one's Ego but, in truth, it rules only the Ego (and images) as presented by the person out­wardly into the world: or magickally from the point of the Lower Self or personality in the lower half of Tipbll li� i� nally� ambiti path a ph� or in11 theJRI the Mil SelHil In I the iDII to thai oute£1 self• persolli Koehl startinj clocbl chilch is ver) psycbl point-41 SOIDCOI they• morel"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"t Germany.

The MidHeaven, on the other hand, is also linked to the Ego; in this case it not only signifies the image that one presents to the world but what inter­nally drives us forward in our incarnation. It is our ambitions, goals and the direction we take along the path of life that we often conceal from others. It em­phasizes a person's quest for freedom to do their will, or in the magickal sense, it's their True Will which is the purpose behind their incarnation. For this reason the MidHeaven is seen from the point of the Higher Self found within the upper half of Tiphereth. In brief, the Placidus system gives us insights into the inner workings of a person's mind in relationship to their personality while emphasizing its affect on outer things in their life; it is very shallow or lower self and outwardly oriented. Its interpretations of a person's chart always begin with the Ascendant. The Koch system, in contrast, interprets a person's chart starting from the MidHeaven, sweeping downward clockwise in an attempt to understand a person's childhood or foundation stones. For this reason it is very popular in the United States amongst astra­psychologists. It is also believed, from a magickal point-of-view, that if you are reviewing the chart of someone who is lucky enough to know who and what they want to be, the Koch system would be eminently more suitable for understanding why. In truth, both"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"80 ALETHEIA systems should be carefully used when interpreting one's chart. Another important point to recognize is the ma­jor distinction between the modem Placidus house system and Koch, thanks to Dalton's streamlining Placidus, which means that certain planets which are found near or on a cusp in a Placidus chart could very well be in the wrong house. Mathematically, Koch saw this error and his system corrects the problem and places all planets where they properly belong, leaving some astrologers now to argue that even if you want to interpret the chart from the Ascendant, you should use the Koch system to figure it out. Since we now have an understanding of the planetary attributes according to the Qabalistic spheres on the Tree of Life it will become obvious as to how these spheres also relate to the 12 Houses of the Zodiac. Starting in reverse order: the 12th House rules the sign of Pisces. The ruling planet of this Zodiac sign is Neptune.

Whether a chart is sim­ply interpreted from an astrological point-of-view or whether the interpretation is bathed in Qabalistic and magickal training, it is safe to say that no two astrologers will ever be alike. A good astrologer is one who realizes this problem and then develops their own intuitive beliefs. Here is a basic breakdown of the houses: First House-Aries 'I' (Mars) Aries is the first sign to emerge or extend itself in the Zodiacal circle. It is the house which dictates the \"beginning\" of all things that are manifesting. Crowley refers to this house as describing \"the individual and temperament\" and their \"physical condition and appearance,\" their primitive or most basic animalistic image which is unique to them which they present to the world throughout their life. In other words this house determines our body-type 83"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84 ALETHEIA or the shell that we have chosen for our incarnation. Plato said it best when he wrote, \"We are imprisoned in the body like an oyster in its shell.\"43 Some astrolo­gers will tell you that the First House is the house of the Ego; driven by selfishness known as \"I'm first\" and \"the world owes me\" mentality, as if it were their right to get anything that they \"want.\" Magickally, this house places more importance on \"Do what thou Want\" above True Will as dictated by \"Do what thou Wilt.\" Both \"Will and Want\" are two aspects of our ego; the justifiable and the false. This house refers to the false ego because it is rooted in the \"Lower Self' which is more commonly called our \"Personality\" or the image of our self as seen and interpreted by others, not necessarily the real person as understood by the individual themselves which is concealed in the 1 01h House. It is Mars, the God of war, who rules the sign of Aries and he bathes this house in an often aggressive primal force which fuels a person's need to pursue new things, and frequently at the expense of not completing previous projects and ventures. 43.

In many ways it refers to the type of incarnation that a person has chosen. It also symbolizes the Moon as it reflects the light of our inner Star or subconscious as it seeks outward Self gratification in mundane things. The First House's selfishness known as \"I'm first\" and \"the world owes me mentality,\" is being defined in the world. However, Aleister Crowley is quick to point out that this house \"does not include gain or inheritance or legacy, nor does it refer to his aptitude for business.\" It is more of a personal quest rather than something received from others. Taurus, being a \"fixed\" sign, implies that change does not come easy to the Bull-Headed ones once self-assurance is achieved. A Taurus is often slow to start on most projects but once it becomes bathed in enthusiasm this fuels its ability to stop at nothing to get what it wants. However, stubbornness if moved to inertia can easily get the better of the Taurus as they accomplishing very little outside of their security point. This house, ruled by the Goddess Venus, implies a love of lavishness, fine art, good food and clean homes and it describes the nature of the passion which drives the need for possessions."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"86 ALETHEIA Third House- Gemini IT (Mercury) As a consequence of its Mercurial nature this house represents communication, travel, and relationships with your siblings, your neighbors and all the every­day challenges that you will face trying to organize your personal experiences in order to formulate your own unique picture of the world and in the process learning how to communicate this perception to oth­ers. In some schools, this house represents in a broad sense-education. Crowley adds that this house de­tails \"every kind of medium\" through which a person \"interprets his personality to his fellows.\" The First House is beginning to reach out toward others both close and abroad. However, Gemini is referred to as the Twins. In classical mythology the twins are Castor and Pollux; collectively known as the Dioscuri. They are opposite extremes of our personality as seen from the point-of-view of mortality and immortality, of in­ner and outer things, and of positive and negatives, Yin and Yang. A clue in understanding this \"mu­table\" or changing sign is to consider that Mercury is primarily a toxic metal. You must learn to hold it correctly, and since Mercury has no shape, if you try to hold onto it from either extreme too tightly, it will flow between your fingers.

This is also the House of unconditional love in relationships, pri­marily with one's mother. On the one hand this is said to be the sign of Oedipus, on the other, due to Cancer being ruled by the Moon, it is also governed by the youngest of the Fates, or Klotho (KAro8ffi ), who has ratified the web of life that we have just chosen. But it is important to always remember that the intimate actions of our incarnation are never carved in stone; only the fact that we have chosen a specific incarna­tion or life and that it is ours to fulfill and no one else's. The Moon has no light of its own but reflects that of the Sun in order to create the foundation of how we perceive the world around us. In most cases our mundane world, whether secure or not, is seen only fleetingly in this house as the sign of Cancer is as unstable as water flowing under a bridge, easily appearing restless, but conversely if the water is still, it dangerously becomes dank and moody.

Often, in self reflection due to our Oedipus, this house informs us of the effects that our early childhood ex­perience had upon us and for this reason the best way to understand this house is to consider that Cancer is the sign of the Crab: often appearing hard shelled and insensitive on the outside but inside it is soft and vulnerable; the extremes of childhood and adulthood. Although seemingly filled with pitfalls, consider this house with one word-resourcefulness. Crowley also adds that this house regulates-\"the latter years of life, the place of death and the end of the matter in general.\" Fifth House-Leo d? (Sun) This house represents creation and procreation, love affairs and children, as well as a quest for amuse­ment and pleasure. It is the house where you are chal­lenged to develop your creativity, self-esteem and to find enthusiasm and joy in living a life so chosen in your new incarnation. The Sun rules Leo, which Crowley refers to as the \"giver oflife.\" It is the center of the Universe.

But if afflicted it can manifest stubbornness, conceit and intolerance as it vomits a dogma of self grandeur as if implying \"my\" Sun is the only light you should follow,\" which turns everyone away from one's own Light. Since this is a House ruled by a fiery fixed sign, in many cases it characterizes sex for personal enjoyment rather than any sort of a deep meaningful relationship. From a psychological and magickal point-of-view this house helps us to interpret how you express yourself prop­erly, as if your inner Sun is extending its Light, in a personal if not creative outpouring. This House is ruled by the 61h Qabalistic sphere ofTiphereth (ml'\\!:111) the Sun. Tiphereth means Beauty and here we must inevitably learn to seek the Laws of our Star for in Beauty is eternal Truth revealed. Sixth House- Virgo TT.P (Mercury) This house represents those things which chal­lenge you to seek competency, to function efficiently, in your physical body, your life and in your work. Due to the nature of Mercury being intellectual, this house gives us the ability to analyze things, not nec­essarily of a spiritual or internal nature, as much as those things in the outer world. For this reason this house fuels our drive to serve others: from employ-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"90 ALETHEIA ers to employees to one's entire job. It is the house of habits, patterns and duties. Being a mutable earth sign, Virgo gives this house its flexibility, versatility and more important, its adaptability and it does so in order to mutate to every mundane circumstance because its quest for work has an insatiable need to feel useful in order to fix, repair, improve or maintain things. If this house is afflicted, Virgos can drive everyone crazy with their fastidious behavior and in extreme cases, those traits which give them the ability to make excellent choices as an employee can easily tum dark and bathe them in lies, deceit and thievery. Due to its Mercurial natureAleister Crowley notes that this house has \"a very secret and peculiar reference to the occult development of the ego.\" He also refers to this as the house of one's \"health\" and others things \"connected with the body, such as his food and clothing.\" This House is ruled by the 81h Qabalistic sphere of Hod (im) or Mercury. Hod means Splendour, although many books will simply translate this word as meaning \"Glory,\" which is not entirely accurate.

It is the house INTERPRETING THE HousEs 91 which dictates the expectations that you have in everyone around you and what you are looking for in each. For this reason it is often seen as the house of marriage, and sometimes of establishing business partnerships and friendships. On the flip side, this house also reveals enemies. Love and hate are two extremes of the same pole. In all cases, in this house a person quests for a balance between these extremes. This house is ruled primarily by Venus the Goddess of Love and Beauty. However since this is a mascu­line sign, sitting on the opposite side of the scales and hidden under the surface lies the negative energy of Saturn, more so in the House of Scorpio. If the scales are tipped in this direction the house can eas­ily become bathed in dishonesty, intense scheming and deception and inevitably unscrupulous behavior emerges toward others, especially your mate. Yes, in many ways, this is truly the house of love. This House is ruled by the ih Qabalistic sphere ofNetzach (n::lJ) or Venus. Netzach means Victory. Eight House - Scorpio ffi.

This house is bathed in a fixed sign, ruled by Mars and Pluto, making its energy often unmovable in its quest. It is the house of secrets, stubbornness, suspicions and resentment, where personal taboos, as well as those of society, are often addressed and where you dig into your own internal garbage in order to find the hidden treasure which can prove that your views and personal quests are justifiable. Think of Scorpio as a compost heap where all the bits of decaying food break down and eventually tum into fertilizer to nourish a new growth, of course this is Scorpio in its positive stage. In its negative stage the Scorpion will sting itself to death rather than be cornered or wrong. This house dictates a person's ability to share and make com­mitments but if afflicted, it could indicate whether or not one will be able to abide by agreements given to others and if not, these negative aspects can eas­ily undermine everything from business ventures, to relationships and marriage. This is the house of death and regeneration, of transformation, of beginnings and endings, both from a positive point-of-view and that of a negative. It is often seen as the house of occult and psychic matters.

(Jupiter) This house represents the challenges that you face to broaden your philosophical perspectives in order to realize your highest potentials, involving educa­tion or those things which expand one's experience toward freedom. Crowley refers to this as the house of \"science and religion.\" Symbolically Sagittarius, who is a centaur, always shoots his arrow toward great heights. This house also represents your in-laws and your grandchildren, foreign travel and the quest to experience other cultures. Also, Crowley adds that this house describes a person's \"aspirations in the manner of spiritual advancement and will indicate the nature of his religious teacher.\" This House is ruled by the 41h Qabalistic sphere of Chesed (1on) or Jupiter. Chesed means Mercy. The MidHeaven The Cusp of the Tenth House is known as our MidHeaven, or the Abyss on the Tree of Life. The MidHeaven, or \"the middle of the skies,\" in one's Birth Chart is known in Latin as medium coeli which is often simply written as b. The Greeks referred to"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94 ALETHEIA this point as the praxis (Ilpa�ts) or \"work,\" but this is more of a sexual nature than anything mundane due to the fact that Praxis is another name for the Goddess Aphrodite as the Celestial Venus the daughter of the \"sky and light.\" According to the ancient Greeks Aphrodite is a dual goddess; one young and beauti­ful, the other much older and wiser and known by the name Urania (Oupavia) which means \"heavenly.\" Urania is depicted dressed in a cloak embroidered with stars, holding a globe in her left hand with her foot on a turtle, which is the ancient symbol of silence. Her gaze is always focused towards the Heavens and it is she who teaches mankind how to foretell the future by the position of the stars. Catullus informs us in Verse 61 of his poem \"Carmen\" that it is Urania who gave birth to a child named Hymenaeus, the brother of Priapus. Astrologically, if you use the Placidus or Koch systems, the MidHeaven will always be the cusp between the 9th and 1Oth house but in the \"Equal House\" system the MC can be found anywhere between the 9th, 1Oth or 11th house. All in all, the MidHeaven is the highest point in your chart and it is said to represent authority or the pinnacle of one's life as seen in the public eye and thus it represent our social standing, accomplishments and reputation.

In the Qabalah we could infer that the dual na­ture of Aphrodite is the same as the Greater and Lesser Mother. As the Greater Mother she is Binah, or Saturn which rules Capricorn. Saturn is often called the Devil and magickally to pass beyond the MidHeaven, or the Abyss on the Tree of Life and into the Tenth House of Capricorn (Binah) one must face the ultimate guardian known as Choronzon which represents everyone's personal demon. If you can conquer your Demon and put him behind you, then as a Goat, you'll sit on the mountain top; which like the MidHeaven is the highest and the most visible point. It is here on the mountain top that you'll achieve the real power which comes from being able to view your surroundings from the highest vantage point. For this reason the MidHeaven represents our greatest potential and our best achievements that we can focus downward off the mountain and into our reality. Basically, our Ninth House represents learn­ing and our aspirations while our Tenth House is the actualization of those dreams. However, magicians have long known that standing on a mountain top, like being within the magickal Abyss, implies that the slightest misstep is magnified many times over;"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"96 A LETHE! A the higher the attainment the more dangerous the fall or in a mundane sense we can say \"the bigger they are, the harder they fall.\" It is important to always remember that everything which descends below the Abyss, from our Tenth House, becomes bathed in duality, this includes the Higher Self. Magickally, if a person attempts to cross the Abyss for egotisti­cal or unjustifiable reasons, the Ego will no longer strive to fulfill the Will of God but instead it seeks the desires and Wants found within the First House. The First House aspect of the Ego is false because it is rooted in the Lower Self, or one's personality as seen and interpreted by others. It is neither real nor is it necessarily a reflection of the \"inner person\" as it is understood and concealed by the individual themselves while they stand on the mountain top in the Tenth House. Tenth House-Capricorn\\() (Saturn) This house represents the challenges that you will face trying to earn respect and recognition as you evolve outward into the world in which you have incarnated. It is the house of aims, ambitions and the direction your life takes, whether positive or nega­tive, based on the choices you've made throughout the course of your life. It is a house of your status in society; of your personal reputation; career.

This is because the Ego, rooted in the Sun, is bathed in an inner and outer duality that vacillates between justifiable and false, our Higher Self (MC-Tenth House) and our Lower Self (First House); or \"Do what thou Wilt\" and \"Do what thou Want.\" The First House aspect of the Ego is often referred to as false because it is rooted in the \"Lower Self' which is more commonly called your \"Personality\" or the image that is seen and interpreted by others, not necessarily a reflection of the \"inner person\" as understood and concealed by the individual them­selves in their Tenth House.

We must learn to place no impor­tance on one thing over another and we should never \"sell our soul\" because to do so implies deviating off the path that we have chosen for our incarnation in order to embrace a mundane distraction. Still, this house has an insatiable thirst for knowl­edge. The problem is that it easily accepts advice, often gleefully listening, but rarely does it act upon this, even if it considers the advice to be valid. The reason being is that this house acts like a scientist. It takes everything in but learns more by experience than intellect. There is nothing wrong with this un­less a person keeps blowing up glass test-tubes trying to repeat the same experiment in order to see where they've gone wrong. Sooner or later the Aquarian has to act \"rashly,\" and as Crowley states, \"rash and even foolish action is really wiser than the wisdom of deliberation.\" In other words, the beaker is broken, pick up the pieces and move on, because to analyze it endlessly implies you're standing still. Crowley adds: \"The habit of deliberation, which is right, may easily become the habit of temporizing, which is wrong.\" In others, cumstanc:lll Aquarius.; This hll one's head walk off11 tion to OUI Star, so 111 and over11 associated clubs and� ideals.

Twelfth House -Pisces 7t (Neptune) This house represents the challenges that a person faces as they explore their inner depths of solitude and silence; especially regarding those things related to mysticism, the occult and psychic matters. It is the house that represents a person's ability to discern between illumination and illusion, between spiritual growth and escapism but it is also a house wrought with difficulties.

It is also the house of secrets and secret enemies. The greatest lesson to learn before you can transcend the twelfth and final house is that you must be willing to let go of all things that are truly unimportant, to solidify the material, focusing internally in quest of the source of being; it is said to be the house of I AM.

It rules our incarnation and our experiences.

In the chart it is said that where Mars is, there is trouble because it implies all challenges we must face and our ability to bravely meet them head on. In doing such it fuels our sense of separation from internal spirituality in order to generate self-expression. It is the fuel which drives our True Will.

This can be caused by a sudden psychological or emotional breakthrough, an unexpected event, or even a drastic departure from one's set patterns; being something that \"over-throws\" that which has outlived its useful­ness to us in our personal internal Universe.

Pluto brings death and re-birth, and in the final stage before transformation is achieved it often bathes an individual in denial that change or New Beginnings are necessary. Pluto, being a higher octave of Mars, reveals the most intense psychologi­cal drives in our personality, both good and bad, also power and its misuse and it reveals areas of our per­sonality where we will be at our most magnetic and dominating.

This comet is named after the centaur in Greek Mythology who had the gift of teaching and healing, with the exception that the only person he couldn't heal, was himself. Hence his title-\"The Wounded Healer.\" In our Birth Chart, Chiron represents an area where we have the greatest affinity to teach but often it is an area where we can instruct others to do something better than we have the ability to do it our­selves. Because of this ability it is said that we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds.

Some Qabalists believe that Chiron is not necessarily a \"new\" sphere as much as it is part of the path between Binah and Chokmah which unites them, this being the Tarot card of The Empress. Regardless if this is true or not, a new, more acceptable map is needed as the exploration of our consciousness continues into the higher branches of the Tree of Life. This symbol represents the largest object in the as­teroid belt, which is another anomaly. The belt exists between Mars and Jupiter. Some astronomers believe"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"110 ALETHEIA that this belt was either a planet which was destroyed, or one that was simply ill-formed. Interestingly, Johann Elert Bode in 1768 predicted that a planet should be found exactly where we now see the as­teroid belt and on January 1st 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, following Bode's mathematical formula, discovered the largest of all the asteroids which he named Ceres after the Roman Goddess; the great mother of uncon­ditional love and fertility. It is the only official \"dwarf planet\" in the asteroid belt and it is so large that it contains over a third of the belt's entire mass. Ceres proper astrological symbol is that of a sickle. The general consensus amongst astrologers is that this particular asteroid describes the development of feminine influences both externally and internally in both men and women. One is reminded of the myths of Ceres, the daughter of Saturn and sister to Jupiter. It was her daughter Persephone who represents the cyclic rhythms of nature and the deeper mysteries of birth, life, death and resurrection. Persephone was abducted by Pluto, the Lord of the Underworld, and Ceres, refusing to give up her up, made a deal where­by her daughter would spend half of the year above the Earth which brought fertility to the land, and the other half in the netherworld which brought winter.

For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth. -LiberAL vel Legis, 1:40 WE have now reached a point where we must reflect upon our Earth and Moon not only as the Foundation Stones of our incarnation but also in relationship to the first four Houses of the Zodiac. It is here where everyone must first focus in their quest to Know Thyself. The most sacred book of Aleister Crowley's Thelemic creed is known as Liber AL vel Legis. In this book it states that being a Thelemite, or a seeker after one's True Will, encompasses only \"three grades\" and not the ten upon which many fraternities are based. These grades are known as \"the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth.\" Regarding this initiatory system, similar to the coils of Kundalini, we are also informed: \"Behold! there are three or­deals in one, and it may be given in three ways.

A:. , spiritual tests.\" 44 The concept of a three-fold initiatory system originates in Gnosticism but more so in northern Egypt in the ancient town of Alexandria. This area spawned what has become known as Alexandrian Gnosticism. Its followers ad­hered to the teachings of Basilides, who lived during the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian (76-138 AD). Basilides broke his entire system down into three \"grades\" which encompassed what was called the \"Material, Intellectual and Spiritual.\" The end result of these grades being the descent of Gnosis, or true Knowledge. It is the lowest of these three degrees that concerns us here, or that of the man of Earth. At this point we must examine Paroketh which is not strictly speaking a part of the Tree of Life but is rather a mythical \"Veil of the Temple\" that everyone encounters while journeying upward on the Tree. Where exactly the veil rests has often been the sub­ject of much debate, but most agree that it is simply a \"Portal Degree\" or bridge which must be crossed 44.

But this division does not logically fit the scheme of the Tree of Life. In theory the division between the First and Second Orders should be placed between our Ruach and what is called the Nephesch or our animalistic soul on the Tree of Life. What complicates this for modem magicians who try to wade through a wealth of material on this subject is that Theosophical and Golden Dawn schools state that our \"animalistic soul\" works out of Malkuth while the Ruach works out of the six spheres from Yesod-9 to Chesed-4. However, later Qabalists like Aleister Crowley, Israel Regardie, Dion Fortune, Paul Foster Case and many others have come to believe that this is utterly wrong.

The central sphere of thts complex being Tiphereth which is your Sun, your inner Star. \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" (LiberAL, I:3) If you tum the entire Tree of Life on its side you clearly see a Solar System with the Sun in the center and the planets swirling around it. You must learn the Laws of this Solar System. The Light of this central sphere is what animates us and our Universe. In one respect we need our persona or ego because it is the driving factor defining who we are on Malkuth, or who we are in our incarnation. On another level the ego must be conquered, not destroyed, because if it remains outside our control it corrupts all that lays below on the Tree of Life. 45.

The Earth itself is the 1Oth Qabalistic sphere on the Tree of Life known as Malkuth (m:J?l:l). It has a symbol like; which represents the four-fold elemen­tal structure of The Kingdom: this being Fire, Earth, Air and Water.

In a way, although the Yesod is the seat of the Kundalini, or the Muladhara Chakra, it requires the use of a body or Malkuth in a symbiotic relationship. 1st House - rules Aries, whose ruling planet is Mars.

This house not only determines but reveals the body-type or shell that we have cho­sen for our incarnation and being the first House to emerge after our Rising Sign it is also directly con­nected to the Fate Atropos. Qabalistically, Malkuth and Yesod encompass what is referred to as Malkus and Nephesch, or our conscious thoughts and our animalistic nature as yet defined by life. \"There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task.

On a broader scale, regarding the passing through fire, Aleister Crowley believed our world itself met its destruction by this element in 1904 when Horus took his role in the East as the Hierophant, thus beginning the New Aeon of Aquarius.

It refers to the 32nct path of The World which extends from Malkuth (Earth) the lOth sphere to Yesod which is the 9th Qabalistic sphere ruled by the Moon.

Yes, an over-view is important, just as it is required when studying the Qabalah and the Tree of Life because you must know the basics of any mystical art before putting it to use. However, when endeavoring to tra­verse the Tree of Life you always start at its base and slowly ascend, sphere by sphere, while attempting to accomplish the spiritual and material aspects of each Sephiroth and connecting paths.

We know that the first four astrological Houses of the man of Earth, are represented by the four-sides of the Sacred Well and that the square within is the Muladhara Chakra, as well as being the two lowest spheres on the Tree of Life: Malkuth and Yesod. 121"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"122 ALETHEIA These two spheres must be fully accomplished on all levels before you attempt to traverse higher. Now look at your Birth Chart and you'll see that planets naturally exist at various angles to each other which astrologers refer to as \"aspects\" or interaction of two forces. These aspects are: � -This symbol refers to a sextile which occurs between two objects at 60° apart from each other.

D -This symbol refers to a square and it occurs between two objects at 90° apart from each other. A square is usually viewed as being unfavorable and stressful; the planets involved often seemed to be \"blocked.\" It is important for the individual to focus upon these in an attempt to reconcile the two forces which appear to being pulling in opposite direc­tions at cross-purposes.

It often shows where a person's creative talents lie, although whether or not we make use of these is up to each of us. However, a trine can also be a \"line of least resistance\" bringing about complacency in a person of weak character; this is �specially indicated where there are too many trines 1� a chart. Such people often stand still, accomplish httle and simply exist day to day without any form of growth, feeling no need for personal development or growth. cf -This symbol refers to an opposition and it oc­curs between two objects at 180° away from each other.

The symbol is like a balance and when one force is used to tip the scales over the other then conflict, confrontation and stress arises. If the energies are consciously balanced, working together then the opposition which creates tension does so with a positive result, often with a motivating and energizing effect where mountains can be moved.

The essential characteristic of a con­junction is that a planet will bring a characteristic that is in accord with its own nature out of the other planet, often in a harmonious way, while causing each planet involved forfeiting some of its primary characteris­tics. Whether or not the union of these two forces is to be regarded as positive or negative depends solely upon what planets are involved. � -This symbol refers to an apparent retrograde motion of a planet in your astrological chart at the time of your birth.

Such qualities often give us a deeper sensitivity with regard to the planet and the house in which it falls. Some astrologers believe that a ret­rograde implies a form of unconscious Karma that comes forward from childhood or from a previous incarnation as if to imply unfinished business requir­ing that we focus inward in order to resolve these issues. But more ofteri, than not, karmic astrologers consider these \"past circumstances\" as unfinished \"negatives\" rather than a \"positive\" foundation that our present incarnation can use as a springboard to achieve our goals. Everything that manifests below the Abyss is balanced in duality, both Yin and Yang, which includes retrogrades."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"XI CoNCLUSION WE can say with all certainty that our Birth Chart rep­resents everything Above and Below, both externally and internally and like the Otz Chiim (o\"n:1 f:17), or the Tree of Life, it has become a favorable filing sys­tem for the expectations of magicians. However, the nature of both being simplicity, while encompassing everything, implies that it is impossible to really fully know either. At best, you might grasp brief epipha­nies or \"aspects\" but examining both together will enable a magician to determine whether or not they have the ability to spiritually climb the Tree of Life. Basically, knowing the correlation between our Birth Chart and the Tree can either be beneficial toward the accomplishment of a given Sephiroth or it can reveal stumbling blocks which could inevitably lead to pos­sible failure if one is not careful. Interpreting this can take a lifetime. So, where do we start? Most individuals begin by studying the basics of the entire ofTree of Life, but once the affirmation has been made to climb into its branches from a purely spiritual point-of-view a person will focus primarily on the lowest Qabalistic sphere of Malkuth (rn�l;o) the Earth and their human body.

This could easily take a lifetime and there is no guarantee of suc­cess. However, if you also begin by focusing upon just the first four Houses in your Birth Chart you get a personal window into what makes your Tree of Life different than others in the area of Malkuth-1 0 and Yesod-9. If there are planets found within the first four Houses they must automatically have aspects to other Houses-study these, meditate upon them and try to figure out how they have affected your incarnation since childhood both from a positive point of view and a negative. Remember, anyone can \"intellectu­ally\" review and study each Sephiroth but if you have planets and aspects that are associated with these spheres or Houses then you have specific lessons to learn which others do not require. If there are no planets or aspects in any given House do not consider this unimportant, you must still accomplish the les­sons dealing with these Houses or Sephiroth. Having nothing within a House in your Birth Chart merely implies that the given Sephiroth may not have any stumbling blocks or that it may not have assistance from other areas which could help you in achieving the Sephiroth. Yes, an empty House could imply"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"128 ALETHEIA smooth sailing but sometimes areas where you think you are at your very safest are the ones where you'll hit a rock. The bottom line, if no planets or aspects are found within a given House it does not negate the fact that the Sephiroth or Chakra doesn't exist. In regards to the man of Earth grade (Liber AL, I:40) you must also never forget that the Foundation you're establishing, especially in Yesod (110\"), car­ries its lesson concerning the Pathway toward the Perfection of Thyself upward into the branches of The Tree of Life. All magick must work out ofYesod (Kundalini) despite which sphere you are presently attempting to achieve. You need the activation of the Muladhara chakra in Yesod in order for you to func­tion on the Tree of life. Never focus so hard on where you stand, forgetting the trunk of the Tree or you'll lose your footing. Most magicians fall from the Tree not from where they are focused but rather from the Foundation that they have built for their footing. Finally, your personal Tree of Life and Birth Chart are so complicated that no individual could ever be familiar with everything that is or has occurred dur­ing the course of one's life.

These signs are ones who most resistant change; they are the perfectors and finishers rather than origina­tors. Mutable signs - Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. These signs are flexible, versatile, and adapt­able. They are able to adjust and mutate to differing circumstances.

They tend to be active, self-sustaining and they usually have enthusiasm for life but they are often impractical and sometimes insensitive to others due to their lacking a dependable relation­ship with their bodies and emotions. Earth Signs-People who are born under one of the three Earth signs, of Capricorn, Taurus or Virgo, are driven to explore the world around them as if beckoned by the earth itself, of course this may or may not be anything more than their backyard.

These signs are much attuned to their physical bodies, being rational, often disciplined while finding it difficult to relate to the ethereal realm of ideals and dreams. Air Signs - People who are born under one of the three Air signs, of Libra, Aquarius or Gemini, seemingly function best when making personal connections with others, both in a social outward setting and internally in abstract worlds. This is due in part to the fact that they often live primarily in a world of dreams. A strong airy type, with a rich inner life, has no difficulty being verbally ex­pressive with endlessly curiosity in both realms. Unfortunately, often with their heads in the clouds, air types have trouble translating their inner world into tangible accomplishments in the outer world. Water Signs -People who are born under one of the three Water signs, of Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces, flow and ebb by emotional currents and often re­spond better to what is going on beneath the sur­face than anything in a concrete material world.
