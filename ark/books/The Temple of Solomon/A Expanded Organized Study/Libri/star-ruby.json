It was first published by Frater Perdurabo in 1913 e.v., in a somewhatdifferent form, as Chapter XXV of Liber CCCXXXIII, The Book of Lies. It was published in revised form in 1929e.v. in Appendix VI of Book 4, Part III: Magick in Theory and Practice. In his commentary to Chapter XXV of TheBook of Lies, Crowley described this ritual as \"a new and more elaborate version of the Banishing Ritual of thePentagram.\" My notes and comments are unofficial and informal. They represent my personal opinions based on myown studies.2.Randy's Handy Guide to Greek, Part 2: The Star Ruby gives syllabic pronunciations for the Greek phrases in theritual. It also gives both version of the Star Ruby, from chapter 25 of the Book of Lies, and Liber XXV from theappendix of Magick in Theory and Practice. The differences between these versions are 1.) the names of power aredifferent and said in different tones, and 2.) Liber XXV contains several typographical errors.3.This version of the Qabalistic Cross is not quite like the Hebrew. Instead of “Thine is the Kingdom and the Powerand the Glory, forever, Amen” we have something like “Thine, O Phallus, is the Mighty and the Gracious One,IAO. Ischuros and Eucharistos both have numerous meanings, and can be regarded as a pair of opposites, “theobstinate and the agreeable” or “the severe and the pleasant”. One is reminded of a phrase in the Anthem of theGnostic Mass, “Appear, most lawful and most mild...” One is also reminded that IAO, the supreme Gos of someGnostic cults, has avery near affinity with another supreme Gnostic deity, the demon/god Abraxas who symbolicallytranscends and unites opposites.4.The term \"Phallus\" may be interpreted, in Crowley's words, as the \"immortal principle\" of either a man or a woman.It is the Principle of Life, continuously renewing itself through the cycle of death and generation.5.IAO is the Gnostic form of the Tetragrammaton, IHVH. The individual letters Iota, Alpha, and Omega represent theEssence, the Beginning, and the End, respectively. Thus, IAO is the equivalent of the Hebrew phrase, le-Olahm,Amen in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. It is also a Divine Name of the sphere of Tiphareth, corresponding tothe heart. IAO can also be attributed to the progression of Isis, Apophis, and Osiris, and to the sounds of ecstaticcries of lovemaking, passion, and union.6.At this point the two versions of the ritual part ways. Frater X.X.X. Has suggested that Liber XXV draws on theforces of Horus, while Chapter 25 of Liber CCCXXXIII draws on the chaotic and cthonic force of Set. My ownhunch is that the original goal of the Prophet was to create a Greek version of the LBRP, complete with figuresfrom Classical mythology; later he resolved to make this ritual specifically Thelemic and replaced the names ofpower with others from the mythology of Thelema.7.The Signs of Horus and of Hoor-paar-Kraat (Harpocrates) are shown in Figure 33A,B on page 606 of Magick: LiberABA, Book Four, Parts I-IV by Aleister Crowley, Samuel Weiser 1994.8.The two variants of the Star Ruby are:Chapter 25 of The Book of LiesEastRoarChaos“Cha-oss”NorthScreamBabalonEnochian, not GreekWestSayErosLove/Desire “air-os”SouthBellowPsycheSoul “psoo-chay”Liber XXV in Magick in Theory and PracticeEastRoarTherionThe Beast “thay-ree-on”NorthSayNuit“Noo-eet”WestWhisperBabalonThe HarlotSouthBellowHadit“Ha-deet”9.In classical terminology, a \"paian\" was a song of praise, especially to Apollo. In this case, the paian is to the GreatGod Pan, where PAN may be translated as \"All.\" Also, the five letters I.O.P.A.N. correspond to the five N.O.X.signs, which are shown in Figure 33L-P on page 607 of Magick.10.Whereas the Hebrew Pentagram ritual calls upon four Archangels at this point, our Greek pentagram ritual invokesfour orders of divine beings: groups rather than individuals. These orders are part of the complex system of Neo-Platonic metaphysics, and a brief mention of them is made in the the Chaldean Oracles (wrongly attributed toZoroaster, who died a thousand years before the Oracles were written). The Iynges (singular \"Iynx\"), Synoches,Teletarches and Daemones are divine principles from the Second Order of the emanationist hierarchy of lateNeoplatonism. Their position in the Neoplatonist hierarchy is intermediate between the \"intelligible\" world, orworld of ideation, and the \"sensible\" world, or world of perception. Their functions are, respectively, as \"initiators,\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Theorte EkstasisThe Star Ruby pg. 3\"maintainers,\" \"perfectors,\" and \"executors\" of the Divine Creative Impulse which originates in the intelligibleworld and ultimately manifests in the sensible world. Further information on them may be found in the publishededitions of the Chaldean Oracles edited by W. Wynn Wescott and G.R.S. Mead, and in the works of Proclus,Damascius, Michael Psellus, George Gemistos Plethon, and other late Neoplatonist philosophers.11.The Iynges are mysterious Chaldean divinites whose job seems to be that of making magic work. Their name (Iunxin the singular) also means “spell” and “wryneck” (a bird of the woodpecker family which was widely used inGreek sorcery) and is the etymological root of our word “jinx”. Iynx was originally the name of a nymph, thedaughter of Pan and Echo. Iynx, taking revenge upon Hera for stealing her mother's voice, created a magic lovecharm composed of a spinning wheel and a dead wryneck to make Zeus fall for Io. Hera then transformed Iynxinto a wryneck. The wryneck gets its English name from a defense mechanism it displays when endangered. Thewryneck puffs up its head feathers and extends its neck to a seemingly impossible length. This behavior makes itappear as a serpent, warding off would-be attackers. Comparisons to the legendary “feathered serpents” ofmythology, dragons, and even erect male genetialia have been made to the appearance of this bird. It is the lattercomparison which earned the wryneck its fame as an aggressively binding love charm or “jinx”.12.The Teletarchs are divine beings who relate or mediate “the beginnings and endings of things”. Teletarchai comesfrom the Greek words telete, or \"rite\" (especially, of initiation into the mysteries), and archon/archai, which means\"lord\" or \"leader\". Their name can also be rendered as “founders of the Mysteries” or “Lords of Initiation”, so thatwe may regard them as the invisible guardians of the Magical Tradition.13.The Synoches are literally the “maintainers”, those spirits whose task is to keep the Cosmos running smoothly.They, along with the Iynges and the Teletarchs, govern the lower part of the celestial world. Sunocheis is the pluralof \"sunochos,\" which means \"joined together.\" Metaphorically, it has the meaning of \"agreeing with\" or \"suiting.\" Italso has the meaning of \"a narrow passage in the road\" which in the New Testament comes to mean \"constraint,affliction, anguish.\"14.The terrestrial world is ruled by the Daimones, which are Cthonic divinities, as the previous three are Uranian.Daimon is a generic word for a deity or spirit, the root word of our demon; it often refers to souls who lived in theGolden Age, or to ancestral spirits in general. The Daimons remain under the earth unless summoned up bywitchcraft, but stay near the surface to serve as protective spirits or tutelary divinities for the living.15.The pentagram has long been associated with magic and mystery. it is known by many other names such asPentalpha, the Endless Knot, the Eastern Star, the Star of Knowledge, the Seal of the Templars, thePentagrammaton (or \"the five letter word\": YHShVH, the ineffable name of the God of the Hebrews when coupledwith the Shekinah), the Goat of Mendes, the Seal of the Microcosm, Gawain's Garter (Gawain used this symbol onhis escutcheon after defeating the Green Knight) the Witch's Foot, and the Goblin Cross. The pentagram is thesimplest star shaped form that can be drawn with a single line. This five-pointed star first appeared around 3500BCE at Ur of the Chaldees, in ancient Mesopotamia, written on pot chards, and was associated with the earliestknown writing. It later became symbolic of power extending to the four corners of the world. Amongst theHebrews, the symbol was ascribed to Truth, and the five books of the Pentateuch. Its usage was parallel with that ofthe hexagram. In ancient Greece it was named the Pentalpha, as it was composed of the five A's. The Pythagoreansexplored the geometry of the pentagram and its metaphysical associations. The symbols of Pythagoreans study wasa ring in which a pentagram had been stamped. To the Gnostics the pentagram was the \"Blazing Star\", and like thecrescent moon, was a symbol of magic and the mystery of the night sky. The Druids appear to have conceived ofthe pentagram as a symbol of the godhead, while the Egyptians can to see it as a representation of the undergroundwomb, and was symbolic in its relationship to the concept of pyramid form. The pagan Celtic tribes ascribed thepentagram to the underground Goddess Morrigan, and later to the spirits of Avalon, the mythical \"Apple Island\" ofdeath and rebirth. The apple can be cut in half to reveal a five-pointed star in its center. Early Christians attributedthe pentagram to the five wounds of Christ, and until the medieval times the pentagram was often used as aChristian symbol. The Christians also embraced the pentagram as a symbol of the Star of the Magi, which lead thethree wise kings to the newborn Christ. After the founding of Hermeticism the pentagram came to be symbolic ofthe relationship of the head to the four limbs. From there, it evolved into representation the pure concentratedessence or \"Quintessence\" of the spirit combined with the four traditional elements of matter: earth, air, fire, andwater.16.Stelei (stele) actually means something more like “slab of rock”, “monument” or even “tombstone”, but “pillar” iscommonly used in translation. It is interesting to note that the six-rayed star, or hexagram, can be interpreted asradiating from the Stele proper, that is, the Stele of Revealing."}]
