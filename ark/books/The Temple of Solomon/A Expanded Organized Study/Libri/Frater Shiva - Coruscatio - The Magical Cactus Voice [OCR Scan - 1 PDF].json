Participants have claimed to experience lucid sensations wherein they have \"out of body\" experiences. Some people report insights into the way the mind works, and some experience permanent shifts in their life perspective. These libations allow one to view their life from an introspective point of view wherein one can travel back in time to a specific moment or memory and examine that moment again, or they can resolve unresolved or negative feelings towards people or incidents from the past. Mystics, magicians and shamans everywhere consider these libations to be a religious sacrament - a powerful tool for access to the divine. Dr. Stanislav Grof has written that the mystical experiences he experienced during his first, legal, LSD session appeared to be indistinguishable from similar descriptions in the sacred scriptures of the great religions of the world and the secret mystical texts of ancient civilizations. POSTULATE Frater Shiva maintains that the results obtained when combining Ceremonial Magick with Liberating Medicine are completely different when compared to a passive encounter with the Medicine alone."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY REMARKS The Terrain and the Terminology A LIBATION is a substance that is defined as a drink, an offering, or a sacrifice. It is also a ritual pouring of a drink as an offering to a god or a deceased person. It was a common feature in the religions of antiquity. A modern usage of the term has taken the form of pouring a small amount of a drink onto the ground (before the first sip is taken) in remembrance of ancestors or friends who are no longer with us. Another interpretation is an act or instance of drinking and also includes the substance that is consumed. The contemporary meaning is getting drunk with an alcoholic beverage and also the beverage itself. Magically speaking, a Libation is a substance that frees the consciousness of the magician so that he or she can communicate with his or her essential self who otherwise might be too far removed for a dialog. After all, the root lib- forms the basis of words like liberty, liberation and Liber (reading a book can set you free). Native American cultures refer to libations as Power Plants. Power Plants POWER PLANTS include Rye-ergot, Morning Glory seeds, Lophophora Williamsii (Peyote cactus), assorted specific Mushrooms, Ayahuasca (Amazonian vine) mixed with the leaves of shrubs from the Psychotria genus, and Cannabis Indica or Cannabis Sattiva (marijuana)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Power Plants and their derivatives have been used for aeons past, as well as recently, by (in alphabetical order): adepts, hippies, Indians, initiates, lamas, magicians, oracles, psychologists, seers, shamans, warriors and yogis in every culture from every time anyone can think of or name. Some schools of thought state that Power Plants will rush your development and ruin your spiritual efforts through premature exposure to cosmic fire. Other schools state that Power Plants will not harm you at all. It being a he, this foolish notion of harm against oneself. PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS are synthetic pharmaceutical chemicals that are made in a laboratory, usually copying or enhancing the psychedelic chemical structure of extracts from power plants. These include LSD-25, Mescaline, Psilocybin, THC, the ever-popular XTC (\"Ecstasy\"), and a long list of modern research chemicals. Other \"mind-altering\" substances include alcohol, tobacco, opium & opiates, coca leaves & cocaine, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, barbiturates, analgesics, tranquilizers, et cetera. While these may affect the mind in certain ways, they do not often (if ever) cause a person's \"perception of reality\" to shift outside of ordinary awareness. A PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCE is a psychoactive drug, including certain plants, whose primary action is to alter the cognition and perception of the mind. Psychedelics are part of a wider class of psychoactive drugs known as hallucinogens. Unlike other drugs, such as stimulants and opioids, which induce familiar states of consciousness, psychedelics tend to influence the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness. The psychedelic experience is often compared to natural non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, yoga, and dreaming."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The term \"psychedelic\" is derived from the Greek words ipuxn (psyche, \"soul, mind, breath, or life\") and 8r|Xeiv (delein, \"to manifest\"), translating as \"soul-manifestation\" or \"mind-manifestation.\" The implication is that the psychedelics can access and develop unused potentials of the human mind. Psychedelics have a long history of traditional use in medicine and religion where they are prized for their perceived ability to promote physical and mental healing. In this context, they are often known as entheogens. Native American practitioners using mescaline-containing plants (most notably the Peyote, San Pedro, and Peruvian Torch cacti, as well as Ayahuasca mixed with the leaves of shrubs from the DMT-containing Psychotria genus), have reported success against alcoholism, and the Mazatec practitioners of Oaxaca routinely use psilocybin mushrooms for divination and healing. Ayahuasca, a potent releaser of psychotropic drugs, is still used in Peru by shamans and for religious festivals. The quintessential toadstool, Amanita Muscaria, the active ingredient of which is muscimol, is substantially different from the Psilocybe mushroom alkaloids, for the two chemicals target separate parts of the brain. Muscimol has been shown to lack \"structured\" hallucinations in most cases, and the effects are frequently compared to a lucid dream state. Psychedelics are not considered addictive by the medical community. A rapid development of tolerance builds up, thus preventing regular use, and there is cross-tolerance shown between LSD, mescaline and psilocybin. This tolerance diminishes after a few days without use. In this case, \"tolerance\" does not mean that one needs more of a substance for it to produce the same effects , but simply that any amount of any of these products will not work at all."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Patanjali \"Psychic and spiritual powers (siddhis) may be inborn, or they may be gained by the use of drugs, or by incantations, or by fervor, or by meditation.\" - Patanjali, Sutra IV -1 Perdurabo \"To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet & be drunk thereof.

Due to his highly popular influence, he was attacked by conservatives in the United States and declared \"the most dangerous man in America\" by President Richard Nixon. Turn on, tune in, drop out \"Turn on\" meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. \"Time in\" meant interact harmoniously with the world around you - express your new internal perspectives. \"Drop out\" suggested an active, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. \"Drop out\" meant self-reliance, a discovery of one's singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. \"Unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity.\" - Timothy Leary < The Men in Black capture a laughing Tim Leary at the end of The Dawn of the Age of Aquarius in 1972"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"psychotropic / experiences under the tutorship of a Yaqui shaman named Don Juan Matus, whom he met in i960.

The Hindu version of the elixir of life, Amrita, is described in the Hindu holy books. It is said that anyone who consumes even a tiny drop will be granted immortality. To this day, yogis and yoginis (yoga practitioners) pay attention to this ancient instruction: \"While controlling the breath and performing mental concentration, your tongue should plug the heavenly pool in the palate. In time, Amrita, the sweet dew that tastes like honey, will [normally] enter the conception vessel in the throat and go down until it reaches the abdominal cavity, where it changes into negative generative force, which then descends to the testicles or ovaries where it creates spermatozoa or ova.\" The idea here is to plug the hole in the palate in order to redirect the elixir toward consciousness, thus preventing, as much as possible, the descent of the dew into physical plane, reproductive energy. The \"hole in the palate\" can easily be found in the midline, near the junction of the hard palate and the soft palate. The"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Coniscuiin location of this small opening is about two inches below the pituitary gland, fueling speculation as to which exotic hormone(s) may be contained within the \"sweet dew.\" The term \"elixir\" comes from the Arabic, Al-Ikseer, and it means \"mixture.\" In Greek mythology, ambrosia was the drink of the gods, depicted as conferring ageless immortality upon whomever consumed it. Both in Europe and in China, medieval alchemists felt completely justified in their search for the mythical elixir of life, a universal medicine said to bestow immortality and to transmute base metal into gold. Of course, an alchemist needed a wealthy patron to finance his laboratory, and patrons are not often found who are interested in spiritual transformation. So the alchemists were quick to proclaim their goal to be free gold, which interested potential patrons a great deal, for surely, a rich man always wants to get richer. Thus the search for this elixir for spiritual and healing purposes, along with a never-ending quest for gold, became the grand goals of alchemy. There was no standardized procedure for fabricating the elixir. For example, in the grimoire, Le Petit Albert, the practitioner is instructed to use eight pounds of \"sugar of mercury\" as the base metal, or the starting point. Bernard Trevisan, the fifteenth-century alchemist, said that dropping a philosopher's stone into \"mercurial water\" would create the elixir. The sixteenth-century physician, Paracelsus, was reputed to have discovered the elixir of life. In his writing, De Tintura Physicorum (1570), there is a description of a tincture that enabled individuals to live for centuries. Modern science has apparently not taken note of this potion. THE ELIXIR OF IMMORTALITY On the other hand, the Taoists, with their obsession of longevity, put their focus on developing a powerful physical body. They thought that by connecting with nature in the most direct manner, a strong and healthy body would develop."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Their ultimate goal was to ascend to the divine realms in an actual immortal body. It was through connecting with the Tao that one could best pursue this development. Cultivating Qi (chi), the vital life force, came through the physical exercises that we now know as Qi Gong. It also came through other wai-dan, or \"external alchemy\" practices. These included the manufacturing of elixirs made from herbs and exotic minerals. It was believed that the consumption of these elixirs would lead to extraordinary powers, and ultimately to immortality. Traditionally, the Taoist arts of nurturing life are divided into two categories: Nei-dan (internal elixir) and Wai-dan (external elixir). Similar to Hindu yoga practices, the internal elixir approach works with internal energy involving deep breathing exercises, sexual disciplines and meditation. The external elixir methods deal mainly with Jing (essence), acquired by performing disciplines such as physical exercise, diet and nutrition, and by consuming life-prolonging herbal supplements. In fact, until recently, Chinese herbal pills were coated with a thin layer of cinnabar and then labeled dan (referring to cinnabar, but also meaning elixir) instead of the more common wan (pill). Cinnabar, or \"red mercury sulfide,\" is the common ore of mercury. In Latin it was sometimes known as minium, meaning \"red lead.\" Even today, many Chinese medicine pills are still found to contain mercury, not as a contaminant in processing, but as an intentional component in manufacturing. Cinnabar was listed as an \"upper class\" drug by Chinese herbalists. Two other minerals, opriment and realgar, both arsenic agents, were merely relegated to the common \"middle class\" status. The Taoist pursuit of immortality continued into the twentieth century, but it slowly gave way to western medicine. The Taoist alchemists increasingly lost face as they were summoned by a long line of Chinese Emperors seeking immortality - or at least a healthy longevity. But they only left the throne empty, again and again, as the reigning Emperor was slowly poisoned and killed by cumulative overdoses of heavy metal."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"< <>nis<..i!in THE ELIXIR OF NATURE Shamanic medical practices are founded on highly-sophisticated, practical knowledge. The shamans view the controlled induction of non-ordinary states of consciousness as potentially beneficial, even in the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and the phenomena of drug addiction. These ancestral, therapeutic practices involve the wise use of medicinal plants, including non-addictive, psychoactive preparations such as peyote, certain jungle vines and shrubs, and \"magic\" mushrooms. THE TRUE ELIXIR When searching for the \"true\" elixir, both modern science and common sense suggest starting the search by rejecting the heavy metals, such as mercury and arsenic. Medicinal herbs can be researched and consumed, and this will supplement and preserve the body's own \"essence,\" perhaps even leading to an increased lifespan - but they will not lead to \"immortality.\" European and Arabic alchemists obviously appeared to work with the transmutation of \"base metals,\" but this was only the exoteric version of a secret process whereby a common man (the \"base matter\") could be transformed into an immortal being. There is a hint of a truth hidden in these esoteric, alchemical concepts. The Taoists certainly had a firm grasp on the theory of immortality, but they got confused in their external workings when they focused on toxic metals. Normally, the Chinese are noted for their careful observation of nature and for drawing practical applications therefrom. But, in the case of Chinese Heavy Metal, there appears to have been a psychopathic obsession involved that persisted for centuries. The Nei-dan (internal elixir) practices of Taoism are virtually the same as some forms of yoga practice, involving breathing (pranayama), sexual disciplines (certain forms of Tantra yoga), and meditation (dhyana). They come very close to identifying and controlling the naturally occurring, internal elixir."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"There is a definite connection between the special shamanic \"medicines\" and the internal elixir, and this is where the \"true\" elixir of immortality, as nature designed it, is to be found. THE IMMORTAL STATE When the term \"immortality\" is used, people generally think about never dying, or at least about living for a very long time. Scientific observation, as well as historical records, show that some individuals appear to have extended their lifespan by decades, or perhaps even by centuries, but no one has yet been found who is immortal in the strict sense of the word. There is, of course, another possibility. Instead of looking toward a physical body that is eternally youthful, perhaps it is a less mundane part of a human being that is immortal. What if there is a soul, or a spirit, that is intimately connected to the physical body - one that exists in a place \"beyond time and space\" that bestows a sense of eternity? This is exactly how Taoists, mystics and yogis describe certain states of consciousness. It has been described as \"the consciousness of the continuity of existence.\" And what if that consciousness could be enjoyed in the here and now through the medium of a physical body? This, of course, is what the secret elixir is about. A realistic and practical quest would then be to seek out a substance, a magical elixir, that would allow participation in the eternal consciousness that is associated with Amrita, the internal \"sweet dew,\" the \"elixir of immortality.\" THE UNIVERSAL MEDICINE There is also a claim and a rumor amongst certain modern Templars that there is a central secret of the ninth degree about which their entire Order revolves, wherein the universal medicine may be prepared through the use of bodily fluids.

THE PINEAL GLAND The pineal gland, also known medically as the pineal body, the epiphysis cerebri and the \"third eye,\" is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain weighing about one tenth of a gram. This gland is reddish-gray and, in humans, is the size of a grain of rice, being around five to eight millimeters in size. Its contour is that of a tiny pine cone, this \"pineal\" shape being the source of its name, and it resides in the center of the brain. The pineal gland grows until a human is one to two years of age, at which time it stops growing and remains stable in size thereafter. But later, its weight will increase, beginning steadily after puberty. The pineal gland secretes melatonin, a hormone that affects waking/sleeping cycles, and this secretion will vary in activity according to seasonal changes and overall exposure to light. High levels of melatonin in children normally retards their sexual development and, indeed, early puberty has been directly linked to pineal tumors. Once puberty arrives, the creation of melatonin is dramatically decreased."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Several hundred years ago, the pineal was thought to be a valve that regulated the flow of memories into consciousness. It was also thought that calcification of this gland caused psychological disorders, but modern science has revealed that all pineal glands become calcified to a greater or lesser degree. The pineal's location deep in the brain implied to historical philosophers that it held a special importance. Thus, it became a mysterious gland adorned with legends and metaphysical theories attached to its physiological function. The 17th-century French philosopher, Rene Descartes, who spent much time in the study of the pineal gland, called it the seat of the soul. He believed that it was the connecting point between the mind and the body. The pineal gland contains large numbers of calcite micro-crystals that exhibit the interesting quality of piezoelectricity, the \"electrical charge that accumulates in certain crystals and biological matter.\" Because of this quality, where the gland exhibits the triple capacities of an electrical generator, a receiver and a transmitter, a pineal gland can be compared to a modern cell phone that can charge its own battery, and then send or receive messages by linking the physical and the metaphysical worlds. Rene Descartes may have been somewhat accurate in his description. In the late twentieth century, the official opinion of the medical community was that: \"the pineal is a vestigial (undeveloped) organ that does nothing but secrete serotonin, and it is therefore of no importance.\" Recent research, circa 1997, has revealed that fluoride, a toxic additive found in many water supplies and toothpastes, accumulates in the pineal, where that gland is now known to be the primary target of fluoride accumulation within the body. The soft tissue of the modern, adult pineal gland contains more fluoride than any other soft tissue in the body - a level capable of inhibiting enzymes. The pineal also contains hard tissue (hydroxyapatite crystals), and this accumulates more fluoride than any other hard tissue in the body, including teeth and bones, causing the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"( <>rusc.iii<> gland to be less effective. Fluoride is an insulator that inhibits electrical activity. A pineal with higher fluoride concentrations corresponds directly to lower levels of circulating melatonin, accompanied -as might be expected - by an earlier onset of puberty. Periodic exposure to outdoor sunshine, 20 minutes or so at a time, will help to stimulate a fluoride-calcified pineal gland. It literally \"charges the battery\" in the light-sensitive pineal gland. In the mid-twentieth century, in California, several surgeons and nurses were busy performing brain surgery. They were trying to excise a tumor deep in the cranium of the patient and the pineal gland was clearly seen. And then the lights went out/ For a few seconds, waiting perfectly still in total darkness for the emergency generator to kick in, everyone clearly saw the patient's pineal gland - for it was glowing! It is undoubtedly the thermoluminescent quality of calcite crystals that causes the bio-luminescence of the pineal gland. Thermoluminescence is a property of some minerals to glow when they are heated. The minerals contain chemical bonds that emit light when heat is applied to them. When the pineal gland becomes stressed, it secretes dimethyltriptamine (DMT). This is the chemical that produces the visions that one might experience with meditation, fasting, sleep deprivation, and out-of-body experiences. With DMT also being released during REM sleep (rapid eye movement), this explains why some dreams can be extremely vivid, yet impossible to articulate. The actual activity of the pineal gland is, even today, only partially understood. Association with the Pituitary The Pineal gland is allied with the pituitary gland, which is commonly called the \"master gland.\" This lofty title was coined in the early days of anatomy and medicine, when it was erroneously thought that the pituitary controlled all of the other glands and, at the same time, they looked upon the pineal gland as \"vestigial,\" \"atrophied,\" and \"calcified.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The pituitary gland really does influence several other glands, but in the final analysis, we find that both lobes of the pituitary are under the control of the hypothalamus. Pituitary and Pineal Glands Pituitary gls Medulla omongaia Pons Pineal gland Cerebellum Spinal cord A connection or an association between the pineal and the pituitary is not emphasized in modern medical science, thus any affiliation appears to be more of a metaphysical nature. The Rosicrucian author, Max Heindel, said that The Third Eye is located in the pituitary body and the pineal gland. He related that, in ancient times, when humans communicated directly with the inner worlds, these organs were the instruments of access, and that they will normally serve again in that function in the future. It should be further explained that Mister Heindel was referring to \"the Light in the Head\" when he mentions these two glands. This light may be seen by the meditator merely as a \"glow,\" or it may be \"star-like.\" The actual Light in the Head is dependent upon the relationship between the electromagnetic fields of the crown center (associated with the pineal) and the brow center (analogous to the pituitary). With \"spiritual progress,\" the vibratory effects of these two centers eventually becomes so strong that the two separate fields will impinge upon each other's field of action (they will \"overlap\") and a unified electromagnetic field will be created."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"C 'nniscmio This will become so powerful, brilliant, and pronounced that the meditator, when closing his or her eyes, cannot fail to see it. Eventually, it will affect the physical optic nerve and activate the subtle aspects of physical vision. One will then be able to see etherically and view the etheric counterpart of any physical object. This is a physiological ability and neither a \"psychic power\" nor a form of \"clairvoyance.\" LIBATION A standard dictionary definitions of \"libation\" is: li-ba-tion 1. a. The pouring of a liquid offering as a religious ritual. b. The liquid so poured. 2. Informal a. A beverage, especially an intoxicating beverage. b. The act of drinking an intoxicating beverage. Magical libations include each of these four reflections of the four elements, plus a \"hidden\" fifth element, a chemical \"key\" that is always found somewhere in those substances that have earned classification as an hallucinogen. Hallucinogens The Keys to the Mysteries Hallucinogens, specifically psychedelics, are mind-altering substances that dramatically expand the user's mental processes, self-awareness, emotions and perception of reality. Hallucinogens include natural substances, like ergot (a fungus), psilocybe mushrooms and peyote cacti, which yield chemical molecules such as LSD, Mescaline and DMT. This trinity of natural and alchemical products then goes on to form countless lineages of chemical substances that may well serve as the master catalyst within a liquid libation. A psychoactive drug, also called psychedelic, psycho-pharmaceutical, psychomimetic, or simply psychotropic, is a chemical substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts primarily upon the central nervous system where it alters brain function, resulting in changes in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, perception of reality, and behavior."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The primary psychedelics, LSD, Mescaline and DMT are illegal in most localities and thus, in this treatise, there can be no recommendation for their possession or personal consumption in any form except as sometimes provided for by local laws. The possession of psilocybe mushrooms and San Pedro (mescaline) cacti is not illegal in many jurisdictions, but the Peyote (mescaline) cactus seems to be universally banned, although South Africa appears to allow one to possess the whole plant - but not cut up pieces or extracts. Fortunately, in the United States, members of the Native American Church are specifically exempt from federal criminal l^enalties for religious use of peyote. This exemption is as old as the federal criminal penalties against peyote use and it predates the Controlled Substances Act. In any case, there are other modern,- lawful, alchemical wonders that are better suited for legal liberation. THE CATALYST A Catalyst is \"a substance capable of initiating or speeding up a chemical reaction.\" Although some biochemical reactions can proceed spontaneously even without a catalyst, their actions would be too slow for attaining the desired results. The addition of a tiny amount of a catalyst can sometimes make chemical reactions proceed faster by a factor of several million times. A catalyst is not chemically transformed during the reaction. By the end of the reaction, the catalyst is regenerated, unchanged and unconsumed, in the process. An example of a biological catalyst is mescaline, where studies suggest that it is not metabolized at all before excretion. Between twenty and fifty percent of mescaline is excreted in the urine unchanged, and the rest is excreted as the carboxylic acid form of mescaline, a likely result of monoamine oxidase degradation where the \"amine\" group is removed by agents that are operating independently from the initial biochemical reaction."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"( \"1 'llsc.ltin The AMD Triad The primary magickal catalysts are Acid (LSD-25 derived from Ergot), Mescaline (derived from the Cactus) and DMT (Dimethyltriptamine - derived from psilocybe mushrooms, ayahuasca plus shrubs or £>u/o-toads.). These are their stories: Acid In 1938, Albert Hoffman discovered a chemical substance that would change the drug culture forever and modify how psychologists and biologists thought about \"mental conditions.\" That substance was LSD. A single drop is sufficient to produce visions and euphoria. Interestingly, it is not physically addicting. Although a tolerance to the drug can develop in as few as three days, it disappears after a week of abstinence. In this case, \"tolerance\" does not mean that one needs more of the drug to experience results, but simply that the drug no longer produces any results at any dosage. LSD is manufactured from lysergic acid, which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. It is so potent that it can be absorbed solely through skin contact. It is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. It is the strongest of the psychedelic drugs. Mescaline Mescaline has always been the primary standard against which other psychedelic molecules are compared. When studying substituted phenethylamines, the United States Chemical Warfare Group used mescaline as the base reference material for both dosage and quality comparisons. The Edgewood Arsenal code for mescaline is EA-1306. The Edgewood Arsenal experiments, also known as Project 112, are said to be related to CIA-mind control programs conducted in Maryland after World War II. All psychedelics are assigned designations that read something like: \"twice the potency of mescaline\" or \"twice as long-lived as mescaline.\" This substance is the primary prototype"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"against which other psychotropics are commonly measured. Early studies with the \"psychotomimetic amphetamines\" had measurable psychological numbers attached to the substances that were labeled in \"mescaline units.\" In the language of the chemists, mescaline is \"3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine,\" a psychedelic hallucinogen and an entheogen of the phenethylamine family. It is either synthesized (as mescaline sulfate) or extracted from the Peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii), the San Pedro cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi), or the Peruvian Torch cactus (Echinopsis peruviana). The top of the peyote cactus is sliced into \"buttons\" and then dried. One can chew the dried buttons directly, or they can be soaked in water and drunk as a libation. A button is three inches in diameter and one-fourth of an inch thick, more or less, and a \"full\" or \"heavy\" dose would consist of sixteen buttons. The Peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii) is not related to the leguminous shrub called \"mescal bean\" (sophora secundiflora); however, they do inhabit a similar range in the arid lands of the southwestern United States and Mexico. And neither of these is related to the highly intoxicating beverage called \"mescal\" or \"mezcal,\" made from the fermented and distilled juices of several North American species of Agave, with the fermented juice being called pulque and the distilled high-potency alcoholic products including Mezcal and Tequila. The 2C Family Legal \"Synthetic Mescaline\" 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, 2C-B, 2C-I, 251-NBOMe, et cetera are synthetic psychedelics that are used as an entheogen. They are somewhat uncommon and have a relatively short history of human use. They were synthesized circa 1980's by Alexander Shulgin. Sometimes they are simply called Phenethylamine. They have structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to mescaline and LSD. 2C-I, called \"India,\" and sold on the street as \"mescaline,\" is extraordinarily clean, causing no physical discomforts of any kind, and without the electro-voltaic quality of the diethelamides.

However, there is currently a political movement tending towards banning the entire 2C family as a class. Dimethyltriptamine DMT is secreted naturally in the brain. So are endorphins (endogenous morphine). This means that the two externally administered drugs, DMT and morphine, are the same as, or very similar to, substances with which the body is very familiar Psilocybin is a naturally occurring hallucinogen. Technically, 4-HO-DMT (4-hydroxyl-di-methyltryptamine), the active meta-bolite of psilocybin, is responsible for the psychoactive effect of the drug. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms have been used ceremonially for centuries for spiritual purposes as entheogens. An entheogen is a psychoactive substance used in a psychotherapeutic, religious, shamanic or spiritual context. THE DOOR Activation of the 5-HT2A receptor is necessary in order for the effects of the \"classic\" psychedelics of the AMD triad (Acid, Mescaline, DMT) to take place. Although these substances have different molecular structures, they each posses a similar \"key\" that will \"unlock\" the 5-HT2A receptor.

It can also be seen as having the subconscious or unconscious realms come into one's awareness. The subconscious realm is said to lie \"beneath\" the conscious mind. This would include the autonomic functions of the physical body and the \"elemental\" workings of Mother Nature, as well as the memories of unresolved, traumatic events that are \"stuffed down\" out of sight and out of mind in what is called \"repression.\" But the actual location of these memories is \"above\" our conscious mind in a \"higher,\" rather narrow, frequency range in the overall spectrum of visible and invisible light. Metaphysicians call this generalized realm the outer court or the lower triad and other similar names. Technically, this includes the emotionally-based astral plane and the computer-like concrete mind of the lower mental plane. The Qabalist would say that we are talking about the combined Spheres of Yesod, Hod and Netzach."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"( !nrusi\\ilin Operationally, these divisions and distinctions need not confuse us or concern us. In fact, they should probably be dismissed, for once a person steps through those Doors of Perception into the next available dimension, he or she is going to be confronted with concepts, symbols and images that are both thoughtforms and emotional impulses combined. In other words, the symbol carries an emotional charge and there is no difference between seeing and feeling, for these entities and memories dwell in the Kama-Manas (\"desire-mind\") realm of being. This is a zone where each singular memory complex is stored in emotionally-energized mental thoughtforms that jointly act as a barrier between the physical world and the perception of cosmic reality. So we have to go through them, and we must deal with them as we go, to get to the goal of our endeavors. They manifest in many ways and their names are legendary, including neuroses, engrams, imprints, complexes, curses, and psychosomatic disorders. Yogis and Buddhists alike know them as \"Mara and his Host of Illusions.\" Magicians call them \"demons.\" These days, due to the diligent efforts of the well-known alchemist, Carl G. Jung, the unconscious realm is formally known as the \"collective unconscious.\" This potentially limitless realm is shared by everyone and it is inhabited by \"archetypal symbols\" such as gods, people, animals, totems, flying ships, buildings and elemental spirits. The same, or similar, archetypes are perceived by people all over the world who are living in different cultures. Thus, correlation between the legends and symbols of various civilizations becomes possible. Although we may speak about the \"astral\" plane, in this case it is but a generalized term. For the actual location of these archetypal symbols is \"above\" our emotionally-based astral world, existing in a frequency range that appears almost endless in its height. God, or other fabrications that describe the ultimate archetype, is often invisible, but in the first row out from the throne there are archangels or buddhas - and they can be seen, sensed and correlated."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"After long studies, many medical and philosophical researchers have concluded that the archetypes appear to be dynamic, living beings. Whether or not this is true is often debated, but the truth of the matter is that they are able to wield power and to influence events as though they were superior, independent entities. So, at the very least, we better show due respect for their power, because if they are not gods, or masters, or universal lighthouses, then they are a part of our own self at some unreasonably high level of consciousness; and both these scenarios may, indeed, be the same thing. Now it may come to pass that a person will have a problem telling the difference between subconscious and unconscious entities, between repressed, personal demons and normally-superconscious, universal archetypes. This is a common dilemma. The solution is to not concern one's self with such matters while in an altered state, but to save these distinctions for later analysis and discussion. The best protection against this concern is to recite the phrase, \"I will interpret ALL phenomena as a particular dealing of God with my soul.\" S.'.S/.S.'. SCALE, SET AND SETTING All hallucinogens are unpredictable.

Depending on the substance and the route of administration, the first effects may be felt immediately or in a few minutes (if injected or inhaled - as in close proximity to burning incense), or it may take from thirty to ninety minutes (if taken orally in any form of a traditional libation). Physical effects may include dilated pupils, higher body temperature, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, sweating, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth and tremors.

Sometimes, on the day after consuming a libation, the user will feel depressed. On the other hand, some users will experience several days of glorious euphoria. And the same participant will probably experience both of these aftereffect moods on different occasions. The user may even experience different emotions at once or swing rapidly between one emotion and another. The person's sense of time and self will undoubtedly change to some degree. Sensations may seem to \"cross over,\" giving the user the feeling of \"hearing colors\" and \"seeing sounds.\" With open eyes, one may experience visual distortion and inhabitants of the subconscious and unconscious realms may appear within the fabric of reality, or they may even become fully materialized for a space of time. With closed eyes, one will likely see fantastic visions that arise from within and are seen by \"the mind's eye.\" These visions have been known to follow a certain seven-step sequence, which runs as follows:1 1. The Dense Physical plane. Eyes closed. Darkness - then external glowing images may be seen looking into the magickal circle (one's \"personal space\") from outside. 2. The Etheric Physical plane - Streaming flashes of light (\"tracers\") are seen, or perhaps glowing, colored clouds, or neon \"rods.\" These various patterns of bright lights are the side-effects of the process wherein the consciousness is \"loosening\" itself from the physical body, much like the \"static\" that can be encountered when one is timing in a radio or television station. These lights have no practical meaning and are of no specific importance, except as a signal that the psychedelic process is beginning. This is Coruscatio. 3. The Astral plane - Kama-Manas. \"Desire-Mind\" thoughtforms charged with emotional force are encountered. These can take the form of anything imaginable, usually in a vision, or as a symbol, or within an entire scenario. Sometimes the vision will remain stable and it can be examined. 1 This sequence may be viewed in the animated video, One Drop, at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROyRyfvQOgo"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Note: \"Do not get caught up in the drama.\" Sometimes the visions will change from one to another to yet another so fast that one is unable to grasp any single image.

The Veil of Illusion - Paroketh - The shifting, blending images merge into a Mandala or a kaleidoscopic vision -changing ever, yet vertically aligned and horizontally reflected. The vertical \"mirror-like\" dividing line down the center of the field of vision divides like a curtain or a veil opening into ... 5. The Realm of the Sun - Central Light imagery - Stable visions with \"meaningful\" communication or interaction. 6.

The Star Realm - Cosmic concepts and insights. These steps represent an idealized, yet completely possible, experience that correlates with the practice of \"rising on the planes.\" It must be kept in mind that individual reactions vary widely, and that a sensitive person with highly charged, subconscious conflicts that are near the surface of his or her awareness, can take a minimal, threshold dose and yet be catapulted into the equivalent of a full dose experience. Every man and every woman has got to know their limits, and an astute aspiring alchemist would usually begin with small amounts, gradually increasing the portion at appropriate time segments, such as once per hour, if required. On the other hand, the entire expanded, multi-hour, visionary adventure is also very likely to take the form of scenes taken out of \"The Papyrus of Ani,\" Coming Forth By Day, commonly known as The Egyptian Book of the Dead.

Light: A \"light\" dose will produce a sense of mild euphoria and harmony with the environment. Visual perception may appear distorted and colors may be enhanced. When the eyes are closed, colored clouds or tracers may be seen. A light dose is one-quarter (25%) of a \"full\" dose. 2. Medium: A \"medium\" dose adds to the above by moving into areas where visions (scenes and beings) may be seen in the grain of wood paneling or even upon the three-dimensional screen of a flat, blank wall. These same scenes are visible in the inner theater when the eyes are closed. Light to moderate interaction with these scenarios is possible, that is, a one-way communication or two-way dialog may be established. An experienced magician, perhaps even the bold beginner, the \"sorcerer's apprentice,\" should be able to perform such acts as \"evocation to visible appearance.\" Striving yogis should be able to attain dhyana (\"meditation\") if the focus of their dharana (\"mental and visual concentration\") is not distracted by endless astral visions - refer to: \"Enlightenment of the Buddha: overcoming Mara and his host of demons.\" A medium dose is one-half (50%) of a \"full\" dose. 3. Full: The \"full\" dose, also known as \"maximum strength\" or as a \"standard\" dose, varies from catalyst to catalyst. It can easily be found with a search engine, and confirmed by visiting at least three different, reputable, reference sites like Erowid, Lycaeum, Bluelight, Wikipedia or Shulgin."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"A \"full\" dose adds to everything mentioned above by radically shifting into areas where visions (scenes and beings) may be seen in physical etheric light or they may actually come into full manifestation, the interesting part being that the scenario is real - and you are there!

Heavy, realistic interaction with these scenarios is probable, that is, one is going to go \"somewhere else,\" just like a jungle shaman, and a one-way communication or two-way dialog will probably be established with some entity or archetypal symbol. Even an experienced magician should think twice about visible evocation at this dosage level, unless he or she already be \"master of the libation,\" for the fate of the sorcerer's apprentice awaits those who overstep their bounds' (i.e., they may lose control of the situation with humorous or disastrous results). Yogis should be able to attain samadhi (\"primordial consciousness\") if the focus of their dharana (\"mental and visual concentration\") has not been distracted by glamorous astral visions or with heroic ego battles. A full dose is the standard, pharmaceutical weight. For example, a full dose of LSD-25 is 500 micrograms (that's 500 millionths of a gram); a full dose of mescaline sulfate is 400 milligrams (that's 400 thousandths of a gram); and a full dose of 2C-T-2 (phenethylamine) is only 25 milligrams. Additionally, there are three sub-classifications: (a) Threshold: A \"threshold\" dose is the minimum amount that it \"normally\" takes to produce any results of any kind. It can be one-tenth (10%) of a \"full\" dose, or sometimes even less. (b) Overdose: An \"overdose\" is usually related to errors, such as miscounting, incorrect weight or misunderstanding, or to heroic experiments conducted by reckless psychonauts who hold little regard for their ongoing sanity. Fortunately, all of the primary psychedelics are in the \"safest\" range, in terms of both lethality and addiction, and especially in comparison to other types of drugs where, for example, heroin is the most addictive and the most lethal."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"( oniNC.iin Active/Lethal Dose Ratio and Dependence Potential of Psychoactive Drugs Hmornm j mm Ntojtlne MmqMm& | Pentobarbital Cocaine ! m : i Ephedra Rohysnol Alcohol j Maryisarm _ #  MOM4   Nitrous oxid* Ketafrime .;..:.

ARCHETYPES Set & Setting may both be manipulated by an external urchetypal icon, and evidence seems to exist to support this concept. On the other hand, one could also say that a dynamic urchetypal symbol is merely formed from an unconscious clement located somewhere in the higher, or deeper, nature of the participant(s). In the end, it doesn't matter, especially with full-strength doses of any hallucinogen, because strange, surreal things are going to happen - and it's going to be apparent that there's a superior intelligence inside or behind the orchestrated strangeness. SET Conscious & Subconscious The \"Set\" is the overall state of the psyche of any given participant just prior to imbibing a libation. The conscious mind will certainly include an awareness of personal expectations and goals, and it can be centered and balanced with ceremonial procedures and/or meditation practices. But the subconscious mind simply is what it is, and its contents, which are usually problems waiting to be solved, will rise to the surface according to their own agenda. SETTING The Environment The external environment wherein the libation is used is a determining factor in the nature of the results. A setting may be comfortable or hostile. It may be in the wilderness or in a medical center. It cannot be too strongly recommended that any setting should be protected by a \"cleansing\" or a \"banishing\" ritual, and that a definite \"magickal circle\" should be established.

It is still wise to conduct an external banishing ceremony first, even if the planned procedure is to be one of internal investigation. Other settings are often not appropriate for a magician or a yogi. Such \"other settings\" include the administration of a libation without any special preparation, and then simply sitting back on the couch to see what will happen.

The Five Phases"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"In the Orient, they do not actually have the five \"elements.\" They have the \"five phases.\" That is, they recognize the existence of one supreme energy (Tai Chi) that constantly flows through five phases of transformation. In the west, these phases are called \"elements.\" WATER - The element of Fear \"Fear is Failure and the forerunner of Failure !\" - Golden Dawn Initiation Rite Of the five emotions, Fear is the most crippling. Fear is the \"emotion\" of the Water element. This is the Kidney energy that is \"inherited\" from the parents and the ancestors (including genetic linkages into \"racial memory\" and the collective unconscious). It is the governor of the nervous system, the source of the reproductive ability, and the repository of \"reserve energy.\" Although common sense, caution and skepticism may be admirable in normal consciousness, once a situation stirs up an element of excessive Fear, the kidney will draw upon its \"reserve energy\" (known as adrenaline) and the entire wheel of life will be accelerated. In particular, the over-acting water element will \"flood\" the fire element, the Heart, and its \"spirit,\" the Shen, consciousness itself, will be reduced to a smoldering bonfire. People in the grip of fear usually fail to perceive the situation accurately. At the same time, the excessive water element will resist the natural control of the earth element, \"insulting\" or reversing the flow of energy back upon the spleen, the stomach and the pancreas. Fearful people are rarely hungry and they can easily become nauseated. Their tone of voice will have a \"groaning\" quality. In extreme cases, the person will do nothing but moan and groan. WOOD - The element of Anger \"The Wood element governs our sense of vision, the emotion of anger, and the sound of shouting.\" - Traditional Oriental Medicine Anger is perhaps the most common emotion, and it encompasses the whole range from simple irritation up to, and including,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"( nniNcaii\" rage. Anger is the \"emotion\" of the Wood element, and this corresponds to the fifth element or \"Ether\" of western metaphysics. This is the Liver energy whose function is to \"provide a smooth flow of energy throughout the entire body.\" It is the governor of the connective tissues and the source of discrimination (the ability to \"judge\" and make decisions). Irritation is a subtle warning signal that tells us things are not right, but when an irritating situation moves into Anger, the liver will become \"stagnated\" and the flow of energy in the body will decrease and the entire wheel of life will slow down and begin to cook. In particular, the over-acting wood element will \"paralyze\" the earth element, the stomach and spleen, and the earth's \"spirit,\" the Yi, the intellect, will be rendered inefficient. People who are angry are usually not thinking rationally. At the same time, the excessive wood element will resist the natural control of the air element, \"insulting\" or reversing the flow of energy back upon the lung with resulting melancholy and sorrow. When the liver becomes excessive, it generates anger. If the anger escalates, dangerous conditions are produced, such as Liver Fire Rising (red eyes, loud voice, anger and increasingly high blood pressure) - and the ultimate Liver Wind (blurred vision, rage, extremely high blood pressure and stroke). When the liver becomes deficient, depression occurs and the person is unhappy. The tone of voice associated with an unbalanced wood element is \"loud.\" In extreme cases this will be roaring or screaming. FIRE - The element of Joy \"... and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this.\" -Liber AL Joy is something that people seek. It is the \"emotion\" of the Fire element that resides in the Heart. It is the Shen, which is consciousness itself. It is the governor of the circulatory system, the source of speech, and the repository of the \"spirit.\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Surely, we can understand an individual's desire to be happy, but the \"excessive joy\" that is pathological is described as \"ding-y,\" \"spaced out,\" or \"euphorically abstracted.\" The laughing tone of voice, which may be actual laughter itself, indicates that the person is in the grip of unrestrained joy and the heart will soar into unrealistic rapture. Specifically, the over-active fire element will \"shut down\" the air element, the Lung, and its \"spirit,\" the Po, the \"animal NOUI,\" will be suppressed. At the same time, the excessive fire element will resist any control from the water element, \"insulting\" the kidney, and leading to twitchy nervous disorders and a lack of reserve energy. The tone of voice is \"laughing.\" In extreme cases this will actually become hysterical laughter. EARTH - The element of Thinking \"A point of great importance would be first to know what is the capacity of the earth? And what charge does it contain if electrified?\" - Nikola Tesla 'flunking, that is, \"too much\" thinking, results in \"pensiveness\" or \"ponderous mental activity.\" This heavy-thinking is the \"emotion\" of the Earth element. This is the Spleen-Stomach-Pancreas energy that governs the intellect and the upper digestive system. Excessive Thinking will slow down any metaphysical process and the appetite will be reduced or suppressed. The over-acting earth element will \"muddy\" the water element, the kidney, and its \"spirit,\" the Zhi, and the underlying life force will be weakened. People who think too much often have a lack of robust physical energy. At the same time, the excessive earth element will resist the natural control of the wood element, \"insulting\" or reversing the energy flow back upon the liver, causing Liver Qi Stagnation and a tendency to become easily angered. The tone of voice is described as \"sing-song.\" It has a choppy tone with notes that rhythmically rise and fall."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"( .'inisi .11 ii i AIR - The element of Sorrow \"Truth is the first quality of the Air Element. It is about finding your own essential truth, the truth of who you really are.  - Western Astrological Aphorism \"if the Metal Element is out of balance, integrity turns to hypocrisy; perfection-seeking leads to disappointment; logic turns to self doubt.\" - Oriental Medical Perspective In the Orient, the \"Air\" element is called \"Metal.\" Chinese metal and western air are the same element in all respects. Sorrow, also called Sadness, Grief or Melancholy, is the \"emotion\" of the Air element. This is the Lung energy that can be used to regulate the flow of energy and consciousness through breathing exercises (pranayama or Qi gong). If a situation becomes excessively sad, the lung will become inactive and the body will slow down. Crying, or weeping, depletes the lung. In particular, the excessive air element will stagnate the wood element, the Liver, and its \"spirit,\" the Hun, the spiritual soul, will be inhibited and depression will occur. People who are sad often become depressed. At the same time, the air element will resist the natural control of the fire element, \"insulting\" or reversing the flow of energy back upon the Heart, just like blowing at a candle. Sad people often complain about the aching of their heart. They may experience imbalance of the metal/air element as an inability to surrender and let go of old issues surrounding grief and loss. Emotional heaviness, sadness and despair, feelings of being victimized, unloved or unlovable are all symptoms of metal/air imbalance. The voice tone will be \"sad,\" or \"grief-filled.\" In extreme cases this will become incoherent sobbing.

Most of them are described in detail in the two epic texts of psychopharmacology, PIHKAL and TIHKAL, written by chemists Alexander and Ann Shulgin. The Magical Half-Dozen The so-called \"magical half-dozen\" are Alexander Shulgin's self-rated, most-important phenethylamines, all of which (except mescaline) were developed and synthesized by himself. They are found within his first book, PIHKAL, and are as follows: 0 Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) 0 DOM (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine) 0 2C-B (2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine) 0 2C-E (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine) 0 2C-T-2 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine) 0 2C-T-7(2,5-dime1ho^-4-(^-propylthiophenethy]amine) THE PRIMARY TRIAD The primary triad of psychedelics is AMD (Acid-Mescaline-DMT).

Window refers to a portal - a Door of Perception, with The Valley of Vision being where one ends up. A Drop is the apothecary's definition of the correct, standard dosage. These correspondences are extraordinarily precise examples of Qabalistic synchronicity. LSD is structurally similar to the brain's neurotransmitter, serotonin. Serotonin suppresses unnecessary information.2 LSD mimics serotonin - but it does not cause suppression. Instead, it allows certain activities in brain cells that lead to visions, shifts in perception and a revised sense of reality. Using radioactive-traced LSD molecules, modern science has been able to track the course of LSD through the body. After selecting certain receptors in various parts of the brain, it then moves to areas with fewer imprints, for example, the right hemisphere, the so-called creative center. By redirecting consciousness, as it were, into the unimprinted areas of the cortex, one experiences the world anew, hence the variety of interpretations which arise. \"A dose of LSD is between 100 and 500 micrograms - an amount just about equal to one-tenth the mass of a grain of sand. Threshold effects can be felt with as little as 25 micrograms of LSD.\" - from an online encyclopedia 2 This biochemical statement deserves special attention. It is subject to medical, psychological and metaphysical wonder and awe, and it certainly warrants further consideration."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MESCALINE Looking at the letters and numbers in relation to Mescaline, we see that: MSKLN M+S+K+L+N 40+60+20+30+700 = 850 850 = \"Perfection,\" \"My Perfect One.\" - Sepher Sephiroth Mescaline was first isolated and identified in 1897 by a German, Arthur Heffter, and it was first synthesized in 1919 by Ernst Spath. It is moderately soluble in water, and soluble in alcohol, chloroform or benzene. It is practically insoluble in ether or petroleum ether. Lycaeum lists the threshold dosage for mescaline to be \"generally considered\" at around 150 mg. An \"average\" working dose is around 300 mg. A 400 mg. dose has been described as an entheogenic all-day experience. Any substance can be deadly in high enough quantities, even water. That being said, mescaline is one of the safest drugs known. There have been no verified human deaths from mescaline ... ever. 2C-T-2 Phenethylamine, one form of which is commonly called 2C-T-2, is 4-ethylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(ethylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine. In Alexander Shulgin's book PIHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved), the dosage range for 2C-T-2 is listed as 12 to 25 mg. According to Erowid, \"a threshold dose would be 5 mg, a light dose would range from 8-15 mg, a common dose is 15-22 mg and a strong dose would be considered to be 20-40 mg.\" The Qabalah tells us that: 2C-T-2 2+K+T+2 2+20+9+2 = 33 33 = \"A Spring,\" \"A Fountain.\" - Sepher Sephiroth The number 33 has many meanings.

The Sanctuary refers to a place where this death can take place in safety. This is another interesting example of Qabalistic synchronicity. Psilocybe cubensis is probably the most widely known of the psilocybin-containing mushrooms.

One online Encyclopedia says, \"Normally, 31/2 dried grams (1/8 oz) of Psilocybe cubensis would be considered an overdose and might well produce a profound experience, yet this is typically considered a standard dose. \"For many individuals, doses above 3 grams may be overwhelming. \"For a few rare people, doses as small as 0.25 grams can produce full-blown effects normally associated with very high doses.

The human 5-HT2A receptor gene Iuin lx;en localized to chromosome 13 (i3:qi4-q2i). This gene encodes one of the receptors for serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Mutations in this gene are associated with mwceptibility to schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive •Unorder (OCD).

A very large family of derivatives from these three classes of medicine has been developed, and their structural relationships luive been extensively researched. Agonists acting at 5-HT2A receptors located on the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells within regions of the prefrontal cortex appear to mediate hallucinogenic activity. The chemistry of psychedelics is closely linked with that of clinical depression and antidepressant medications. All classical psychedelics are 5-HT2A receptor agonists. Most of them have other effects on the brain as well, which contribute to the unique effects of each drug, but 5-HT2A iiKonism is what they all have in common. 5-HT2A receptors are excitatory receptors expressed throughout the brain, and they are especially dense in the key pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex. They are normally activated by serotonin (5HT), which is the neurotransmitter that is most often thought of as being implicated in depression. The relationship between 5HT and mood is very complicated, and depression is not simply a disorder of \"low serotonin\", but there is strong evidence that it is involved."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"i .\"HIM .tri«i When consulting the Tables of Correspondences, we see that: 5-HT2A 5+H+T+2+A 5+5+9+2+1 = 22 22 = \"Deep Meditation\" and \"A Magical Vision.\" - Sepher Sephiroth The number 22 has many meanings. These two correspondences speak for themselves. FLUOXETINE Fluoxetine hydrochloride, a pharmaceutical drug marketed under the brand name Prozac [® ELI LILLY], and other names, is a \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\" [SSRI]. Serotonin (which suppresses unnecessary information) is released into the body - and then it is normally reabsorbed (this re-absorption is the \"re-uptake\" process). But fluoxetine inhibits the reabsorbing process and serotonin levels then \"back up\" in the body. In this manner, increased serotonin levels will act to suppress even more \"unnecessary information.\" This is done in order to reduce incoming neural signals from reaching a patient's awareness in an attempt to lighten the input load in depressive disorders. The problem is that this is a form of pharmaceutical repression and information that actually is \"necessary,\" and needs to be dealt with, is routed away into the subconscious mind. The result can be fatal. One of the major side-effects of fluoxetine is suicide. How many drugs can make that claim? Fluoxetine has a 1200% higher suicide rate than other antidepressants.1 The psychedelics, which act in a diametrically-opposed manner to SSRIs, appear to have no suicidal side-effects. Researchers noted that the published LSD literature directly records only one suicide and that was in a patient who was already diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the 1960s, among healthy experimental subjects given LSD, the suicide rate was zero. The rate of suicide attempts among psychiatric patients given LSD was 1 in 800; the rate among experimental subjects given LSD was zero.\" Many SSRIs are organofluorine compounds - they contain fluorine."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"BIOCHEMISTRY \"We conclude that phenethylamine and indoleamine hallucinogens may exert their hallucinogenic effect by interacting with 5-HT2A receptors via a Ca2+/CaM-KII-dependent signal transduction pathway as partial agonists and modulating the NMDA receptors-mediated sensory, perceptual, affective and cognitive processes.\" - The European Journal of Neuroscience 1999 Sep; 11(9): 3064-72 THE PINEAL The pineal gland contains a number of peptides, including GnRH, TRH, and vasotocin, along with a number of important neurotransmitters such as somatostatin, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine. The major pineal hormone, however, is melatonin, a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. The precursor to melatonin is serotonin, a neurotransmitter that also is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.. Melotonin is the only hormone secreted by the pineal gland. Melatonin was discovered in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner and other researchers working at Yale University. Melatonin is produced in humans, other mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. It is present only in very small amounts in the human body, where it: 0 Causes Feeling of Sleepiness 0 Converts Nerve Impulses to Endocrine Signals 0 Regulates Endocrine Functions SEROTONIN Serotonin is one of the four main neurotransmitters in higher vertebrate nervous systems. Serotonin is transported via the bloodstream to the nerve cells throughout the body, but especially to the neurons of the brain. It is utilized by the nerve cells for the complete execution of electrical impulses across the synaptic gap (which is the micro-gap between every pair of connecting nerve cells)."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"('oruNcanc The impulses travel along the nerve cell with the ionic forms of calcium and potassium until they reach the end of the cell's dendrites (\"fingers\") where the electrical impulse is transformed into the neurochemical serotonin. This is then \"squeezed\" out into the intercellular space to connect with the other side of the gap, which is the beginning of the next nerve cell. THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER The Veil of the Mysteries on the Physical Plane Few molecules can penetrate what is known in physiology as the \"blood-brain barrier.\" Those chemicals that can pass this veil go directly to the neurons or nerve cells. It then becomes a matter of their ability to imitate one of the naturally-occurring neurotransmitters. Psychedelics all function by mimicking one of the neurotransmitters. LSD, Mescaline and DMT are among the more famous imitators. They not only penetrate the blood brain barrier, but they then slip into the transmission sites inside the nerve cells themselves. Then they mimic serotonin so well that the body treats them as serotonin and subsequently shoots the psychedelic molecules across the synaptic gap. When the chemical reaches the other side, it is biochemically accepted, but it doesn't carry the message any further, for the impulse of electricity has been redirected down less familiar pathways - pathways that have not been highly conditioned or \"imprinted.\" Specifically, a psychedelic affects the oldest parts of the brain first, including the upper end of the spinal cord, the medulla oblongata, the cerebrum, the pineal gland and the hypothalamic region. Next, the bloodstream takes it forward into the location of sight interpretation, then sequentially up through the area of hearing, the cerebellum, the interpretive centers of other senses, and finally into the motor (muscle-control) areas. It has been estimated that a human being uses only ten-percent of his or her brain capacity.

CANNABIS A pu ff of kief in the morning makes a man as strong as a hundred camels in the courtyard. \"' Cannabis, also known as marijuana, et al, refers to a wide variety of preparations of the Cannabis plant intended for use as a psychoactive drug or for medicinal purposes. According to the United Nations, cannabis is \"the most widely used illicit substance in the world.\" The major psychoactive chemical compound in cannabis is Ag-tetrahydrocannabinol (commonly written as THC). Cannabis contains more than four-hundred different chemical compounds, including at least sixty-six additional cannabinoids. Evidence of cannabis use has been found back to 3,000 BC. In contemporary civilizations, it has been used for recreational, religious, spiritual and medicinal purposes. The possession, use, or sale of cannabis preparations containing psychoactive cannabinoids became illegal in most parts of the world in the mid-20th century. A study published in the UK medical journal, The Lancet, ranked cannabis as one of the least harmful drugs. There are more than 30 metabolites of THC and over 20 each of cannabinol and cannabidiol. Many of these metabolites are also psychoactive. Researchers have confirmed that THC exerts its effects via two types of cannabinoid receptors, the CBi receptor and the CB2 receptor, both of which are G-Protein coupled receptors. The CBi receptor is found primarily in the brain as well as in some peripheral tissues, and the CB2 receptor is found exclusively in peripheral tissues. THC appears to alter mood and cognition through its (partial) agonist actions on the CBi receptors, which inhibit a secondary messenger system.

This will make possessing and selling these chemicals or the products that contain them illegal in the U.S. for at least one year while the DEA studies whether these chemicals and products should be permanently controlled. JWH-018, for example, is a full agonist at the CBi receptors and is five times (sx) stronger than THC. Other similar chemicals are even stronger, very much stronger. Beware the chemicals that carry a fluorine atom in their molecular structure; their safety has not been demonstrated and fluoride is the enemy of illumination. The effects of cannabis reach their physiological potency about 20 minutes after inhaling; JWH is reportedly \"instant,\" which means only a few seconds, or less.

He then clearly described what he was experiencing. First, he was essentially paralyzed; although he could move his fingers and toes, and although he could speak and hear, he was unable to sit or stand.

Addiction The general widely-promoted idea is that cannabis is not addictive, but that one can develop a \"psychological dependency.\" However, in medical schools they define an addictive substance as one that that, after taking it on a regular basis and then stopping, will produce \"physiological symptoms.\" Based on that definition, cannabis is addictive, and so is caffeine. Although their withdrawal symptoms are mild when compared to the high-powered narcotics and stimulants, there is a certain amount of discomfort. Cannabis also displays a form of tolerance, but in its own unique manner. That is, in reference to its smoked usage, one may require large amounts in the beginning (many puffs) in order to notice any effects, but after a few days only a puff or two is needed; this is a form of \"reverse tolerance.\" But then, after using it regularly for several days, one notices that it just isn't working properly; in the same style as the psychedelics, it begins to have less and less effect and increasing the dosage will not increase the results.

In a temple ceremony, even before the |)urticipants assemble, a general background incense can be burned, one chosen to set the \"vibratory\" tone for the working. Later, usually following the banishing, a specific incense is added to the censer that conforms to the qualities of the deity who is about to be invoked. Psychologically speaking, the cannabinoid establishes a preliminary \"vibratory\" sensitivity in • the participant's consciousness before any formalities take place; then, usually forty minutes (or so) before the banishing, a specific psychedelic libation is taken. Medically speaking, a cannabinoid can be useful after the entire event, for there are sometimes reports of aching and other minor physical discomforts earned upon re-entiy into the Bardo of \"Harsh Reality.\" One specific technique has been reported wherein JWH-018 was smoked prior to imbibing 2C-I. Then, once the \"India\" was working, participants could, one puff at a time, increase the psychedelic effects dramatically. Pot Why should Cannabis carry the common street name \"Pot?\" The origin of this quaint title comes from the farms of rural Mexico. In every primitive adobe or stick household, more or less, the residents will use an alcoholic extract of marijuana that is rubbed on sore muscles, aching joints, and even cuts and bruises. This extract is kept in a large glass jar or glazed ceramic pot. Stuff the pot with cannabis leaves and pour in pure cane alcohol (about 192 proof - legal in Mexico, but hard to find in the \"civilized\" world). Hurt yourself ?

It is also among the most addictive of drugs and its daily use constitutes a health hazard for many people, including Indians. On the other hand, some individuals will smoke tobacco for a lifetime and then die from a cause that is completely unrelated to the inhalation of tobacco smoke. Madame Helena Blavatsky and Sir Aleister Crowley could easily become the poster-children for the mystical tobacco movement. Blavatsky was said to have demonstrated an act of levitation wherein she elevated herself up to the level of a candle-flame-lit chandelier in order to light a cigarette. Now that would be a grand entry in the YouTube galleries! There seems to be no proof that this exhibition actually took place, but there are formal photographic portraits of her holding a burning cigarette. There are many, many photographs of Crowley and it seems that he is smoking in a large percentage of these pictures, perhaps most of them. When a person has taken a libation and is about halfway through the experience, it is possible that they will find themselves completely conscious but \"way out there\" and they will want to \"level off\" or \"get grounded\" and a bit of tobacco will help them to stabilize. This brings up two considerations: (1) The concept of tobacco being an antagonist in relation to psychedelics, that is, a partial antidote, and (2) the addictive qualities of tobacco might be greatly reinforced when a cigarette is used to regain stability when in an altered, expanded state of consciousness.

Behavior is unpredictable and, at times, completely irrational and can be expected to last from 4 to 24 hours.

This era has now ended and analysts, as well as experimenters, magicians, yogis and hippies, are essentially prohibited from possessing or using these molecules. In the later 1960s, LSD was made illegal in the United States and controlled so strictly that not only were possession and recreational use criminalized, but all legal scientific research programs on the drug in the US were shut down as well.

BAD TRIPS Having a \"bad\" psychological reaction with psychedelics is common. The scary sensations can last a few minutes or several hours and they may be frightening or terrifying. The user may also experience panic, confusion, suspiciousness, paranoia, anxiety, feelings of helplessness, and loss of control. Sometimes a psychedelic can unmask mental or emotional problems that were previously unknown to the user. These reactions are all based on subconscious, repressed scenarios (complexes). They are the \"demons\" of the magician, one form of the \"breaks\" of the yogi, and the \"causative factors\" of various psychological disorders.

Every initiate has to \"pass through the Tuat.\" The Tuat is the ancient Egyptian tunnel through which flows the underworld river of the dead. It is populated with gods, mummies, serpents and demons. Others may experience something like \"passing through the Bardos,\" the Tibetan afterlife that is populated with animals, gods and demons. The scenario will vary according to one's genetic code or cultural upbringing ... but there are always those demons! And there's always a light at the end of the tunnel. PRANAYAMA Performing various breathing techniques, while concentrating on the third eye position on the brow (or better, behind the brow), will slowly but surely cause the pineal to produce less melatonin and serotonin, which in turn will bring about a change in consciousness similar to that encountered with psychedelics. A STAR UPON THE BROW Upon an ancient Chinese scroll, a dialog between a Taoist master and his student has been written: The student asks the Master, \"Will you kindly tell me the exact position of the original cavity of the spirit?\" The Master replies, \"It is in the center of the head behind the spot between the eyebrows. Lao Tzu called it the gateway to heaven and earth', hence he urged people to concentrate on this center in order to realize the oneness of all things. In this center is a pearl of the size of a grain of rice, which is the center between heaven and earth in the human body; it is the cavity of prenatal vitality. \"To know where it lies is not enough, for it does not include the wondrous light of nature that is symbolized by a circle, which father Confucius called virtuous perfection; the Book of Changes, I Ching, calls it the \"ultimateless\" {wu chi) and the Taoists have"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"named it the elixir of immortality or spiritual light, which all point to the prenatal One True Vitality. He who knows this cavity can prepare the elixir of immortality. \"Therefore, during practice, both eyes should turn inward to the center between and behind them in order to hold on to this One that is held in the original cavity of the spirit with neither strain nor relaxation; this is called fixing spirit in the original cavity, which is the root from which eternal life emerges.\" If one were to ask people, \"Where is the third eye point?\" or \"Where is the brow chakra located?\" most of them would probably point to the middle of the forehead. After all, that's where those people in India paint a red dot - right in the center, or perhaps a little below the center. Some people have even come to the (false) conclusion that this point is between the eyes. Concentration (dharana) upon any of these points will ultimately bring the same results, and these results will possibly come quicker if the meditator shifts the focal point about three inches posterior (back) of the brow where it coincides with The Light in the Head. Oriental Medicine comes to our aid by providing the precise energetic and anatomical location of the point that connects with the brow chakra. It is called The Hall of Impression, or Seal Hall, or Seal Mark. Its Chinese name is Fin Tang, numbered \"Extra-HN-3\" or \"Extra #1\" in various texts. It is one of the \"extra\" points, that is, it is not directly related to any of the named energy channels, but it stands on its own as a powerful regulator. The image is that of an official hall where the seal of the Emperor is affixed to documents. Spiritually, it is the point where the divine Will meets (is affixed to) a person's vision.

It is slightly elevated, and joins the two superciliary (above the eyebrows) ridges. SEX The sexual function is intimately associated with psychedelics, the head centers, various hormones, the personal \"chemistry\" between the participants, and the set and setting. This same sexual energy can be directed toward specific goals, such as \"oneness,\" \"enlightenment,\" \"initiation,\" or it can be used to generate energy in order to cause change to occur. The chosen \"direction\" is predetermined through variations in the setting, such as yoga and/or ceremonial magick. Timothy Leary advocated a sexual experience being incorporated into every psychedelic event, stating that it should be \"planned.\" Among psychedelic researchers and participants, several characteristics have been repeatedly reported: The sexual union lasts much longer than normal, extending to two to three hours of clock time, yet experienced as being even much longer than clock time due to a sense of \"timelessness. An orgasm is experienced as an \"oceanic, non-ego experience,\" and sex without orgasm is sometimes perfectly satisfactory. THE ZHI Oriental Medicine presents an interesting picture that puts these matters into an alternative perspective for the western mind. It begins with the Water element. In the beginning was the Void. And darkness passed over the waters of the deep. The Void is, of course, the Tao. From Tao springs forth yin and yang; this ancient formula for creation has been confirmed by the 0 = 2 formula as expounded by Aleister Crowley and reconfirmed in the theory of relativity as explained by Albert Einstein. Yin and yang then unite to create a third entity, and from this the ten thousand things derive."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"In terms of a human being, three forms of energy must come together to create human life. Two of these have a physical presence, namely the male sperm (yang) and the female ovum (yin). A third intervening force is the universal life force, which in Chinese is \"The Spirit of Heaven.\" The Qi of the sperm and ovum unite to form Xian Tian Zhi Qi, formally known as \"Before Heaven Will Energy,\" but more commonly called \"Ancestral Qi.\" Today, westerners define this same concept in terms of chromosomes and genes. The Chinese understood this form of inherited energy thousands of years before modern biologists discovered the molecular structure of the double helix. They understood that the hereditary factor was established at conception and that it played a major role in the health and life-span of the individual. Xian Tian Zhi Qi (Ancestral Energy), which is stored in the kidneys, is acquired only at conception, and it must last for a |>erson's lifetime. It circulates internally and exerts an influence, directly or indirectly, on all other transformations of Qi within the body. Although it can never be increased, it can be drastically weakened by the failure of an individual to conduct a reasonably sensible and balanced life, in which case that life will be shortened accordingly. Although this inherited energy cannot be increased in any manner, it can be \"supplemented\" with herbs, meditation, energetic exercises, lifestyle modifications and (especially) regulation of the reproductive system, thus reducing the demand on the \"ancestors,\" while creating a more \"fuel-efficient\" operating system. But such measures are always slow in taking effect, for supplementation of the kidney energy is the longest and most lengthy of the treatment processes. Thus, a child is conceived and grows for nine months in its mother's womb. The sperm and ovum, having united into a single cell, proceed to grow in two directions from a position that is found in the lower back, just below the spinous process of the second lumbar vertebra. This acupuncture point, appropriately titled Ming Men or \"Gate of Life,\" allows access to the original cell that grew upward and downward to form the spinal column, the brain, the nervous system and the reproductive organs.."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"( .nnisi'.Mlri The fully self-contained processes of physiology are not activated until the new-born baby takes its first breath. It should be noted that, despite many attempts to \"put a name on Qi,\" the exact and direct translation of the word Qi (chi) is \"breath\" - obviously, the breath of life. When a person stops breathing, they are said to be \"dead.\" The physiological processes that will support the child throughout life begin with that first breath, and then, removed from the protective environment of its mother's womb, the baby is exposed to the indirect and direct influences of cosmic energy. The indirect form is food, which rises from the earth to unite with the direct form of cosmic energy in the form of oxygen and the electromagnetic radiations that permeate the universe itself. Attention is being drawn specifically to the kidney and its accompanying \"spirit,\" the Zhi or Will, because it bears directly on the subject of liberation. However, a brief exploration into the nature of the four other spirits is now provided in order to understand their relationships with the kidney and to enhance the description of their interactions. According to Taoism, the highest use of Zhi, the personal will, is to align one's self with the \"Will of Heaven,\" i.e. with the Tao. The spirit-infused action arising from such a choice has the quality of Wu Wei - the highly sought \"spontaneously correct action.\" Thus, it appears, the general philosophy of Thelema (Will) has been around for centuries. The Hun or \"ethereal soul\" is the aspect of consciousness that continues to exist in more subtle realms, even after the death of the body. The Hun enters the body three days after birth and is imparted by the father. Ethereal in nature, after death it survives the body and flows back to \"Heaven\" (Tian). The Shen is the spirit of the Heart, and being consciousness itself, it is the Emperor, or dominant ruler, of the whole system, with various aspects of its power residing as the spirits of the other organs."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"('onisciino Yi includes the capacity to use our conceptual mind in exercising discernment and discrimination and also to formulate the exercise of intentions. Since the Po, the \"corporeal soul\" exists only within the era of a single lifetime, it tends to be associated with immediate needs and personal desires - as opposed to the Hun, which expresses more long-range commitments. The \"Before Heaven Energy,\" Xian Tian Zhi Qi, is always in the background and in the foundation of all physiological and behavioral activities. But it is not immediately accessible. It is like some \"secret chief,\" orchestrating all growth, development, maintenance and reproduction from a remote location. Yuan Qi, or \"source energy,\" is the activated and physically-empowered part of Xian Tian Zhi Qi that is accessible to the body, and it acts in the capacity of a catalyst. It circulates from the kidneys, mainly by way of the powerful \"eight extra meridians,\" and is concerned with the transmutation of one form of energy into another. For example, the primary, ongoing life cycle follows this pattern: 1. Food, the essence of the Earth, is taken into the stomach. 2. The catalyzing activity of the kidney's Yuan Qi drives-off, or \"distills\" the essential energy of the food from the non-nutritive, bulky mass of the food. This essence is called Gu Qi (pronounced goo-chi - it is \"nutritive energy\"). 3. In the lungs, the Gu Chi combines with Qing Qi, the energy of air (also known as oxygen plus prana). This combined energy is called Zong Qi, or \"chest energy.\" This energy is specifically drawn upon whenever a person is using their muscles and breathing deeply. This is the primary triad in the process of creating immediate, here-and-now, internal energy. But it is not the final form of energy that will provide a reservoir of substantial nutrition for the whole body, and for that, the influence of Yuan Qi is again necessary."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"4. The catalyst, Yuan Qi, promotes Zong Qi in the chest to transform into Zhen Qi, the \"true\" or \"nourishing\" energy, which circulates through the organs in the order of the generating Shen cycle of the five phases of transformation (the \"five elements\"). After being used by each organ, any leftover energy is stored in the kidneys where it is called Cheng Qi, a reservoir of refined concentrated energy available for use in emergencies. In the west, Cheng Qi is called Adrenaline. When a psychoactive substance permits a person to see or otherwise travel into the unconscious realm, the personal visions and the archetypal symbols are being provided by the data banks that are stored in the Xian Tian Zhi Qi, the Ancestral Energy. Most of these interactions will be with the Yuan Qi aspect of the inherited life force. Yet the kidney spirit holds many other mysteries, all of which will be encountered if one goes deep enough, including: Zhi - Will, including personal willpower. The will to survive and live, thus, \"life force.\". The divine Will is universal, but its application to any given individual is contained within the Ming. Ming - Destiny. The \"blueprint\" of one's intended path through life. Yuan Qi - The catalytic \"source energy.\" Jing - The \"Essence\" of life. It is essential for systemic vitality and active reproductive fluids.

Some schools of thought ascribe spontaneous awakenings to \"grace\" or to spiritual attainments secured in past lives. Kundalini is Sanskrit for \"snake\" or \"serpent power,\" because it is said to lie coiled like a dormant serpent in the root chakra at the base of the spine. In Tantra Yoga, kundalini is an aspect of Shakti, the divine female energy and the consort of Shiva. There is even a specialized lineage called kundalini yoga, but the presence and powers of the \"coiled serpent\" are known throughout all the various traditions and styles. Some religious institutions in the western world, in a muddle of confusion, have been known to associate kundalini with the concept of the devil. In the east, practitioners say that kundalini energy can be \"awakened\" by a guru, but they emphasize that one's body and spirit must be prepared by austerities such as physical exercises and postures, breath control and visualization. Psychedelic libations will affect the kundalini force. Some practitioners may not associate their experiences with any of the kundalini symbolism, while others will be able to directly relate to any or all of its phenomena, which can vary from bizarre physical sensations and movements, pain, clairaudience, visions, brilliant lights, super-lucidity, psychic powers, ecstasy, bliss, and self-transcendence.

Some cycles (a cycle is one complete back-and-forth oscillation) are lengthy; it takes the earth one entire year to undertake just one cyclic vibration in relation to our sun.

If these visions arise in the sleep state, there is usually no control or stability, and \"meaningful content\" is sometimes sought in any remaining memory fragments through dream analysis. If these visions arise in the meditative state, or through the use of a psychotropic drug, there is usually no control or stability in the beginning, but mastery can be developed. Even in the earliest of psychedelic experiments, the transmission of \"meaningful content\" is often immediately delivered. This \"mastery\" is most easily developed when a libation is combined with practices in Raja Yoga and/or ceremonial magick, by whatever mystical name or method of wizardry they are called, especially when these arts have already been in play for a while as a regular discipline. ADelta (A) is the realm of the dead. That is, a person is either \"dead asleep\" with no corresponding dream activity, or he is in a meditative realm that is so deep, so expanded, that the meditator has transcended visions and words and mental concepts. A period of approximately forty-five minutes in delta is required each night in order for an individual to \"recharge their battery\" and to awake with a feeling of refreshment in the morning. The rest of the sleeping hours are spent in theta, the dream state, but this range does not \"regenerate;\" it does not give the \"rest\" of delta. This is the realm of samadhi, of cosmic consciousness, but only if the awareness can be maintained, only if the \"continuity of consciousness\" can remain intact. In sleep, in meditation, and in psychedelic encounters, as the burning tip of awareness accesses delta, one will pass into the void and become \"dead to the world,\" or their ego will die (their sense of separate existence will disappear), or they will simply \"black out\" if they are not properly aligned."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Entering into the delta range is like passing through a veil, but there is no backside to the curtain. The ultimate goal, the Primary Clear Light, the primordial consciousness, is only found ut the bottom of delta - at zero. 0Zero (0) is the ultimate sign of clinical death in the hospital. When the breathing stops, the heart may still beat on for a while, but when the brain ceases to exhibit electrical activity via the EEG, the doctor or nurse turns to the clock to note the Time of Death. Zero, a perfect, dynamic, living balance, is the number of the key that fits in any lock. It is one of the major keys in magick and likewise serves the mystic in passing the veils. In the psychedelic state, there is no need to worry about the brain as some have done, because it will keep firing along in all the frequency ranges even though the participant's delta frequencies are \"spiking.\" It is obvious that as these phenomena proceed from normal waking consciousness into contemplation into hallucinogenic visions that arise of their own accord into a void realm into an invisible all-encompassing light, that the brain is slowing down. Yet the brain does not really slow down; rather it shifts its major output into a slower frequency range where its dynamic activity registers as a \"spike,\" or an increase in electrical activity, in alpha or theta or delta. Thus the mystic can come to be awash in delta waves, and if he or she has dispersed the sense of personal self, the other waves and ranges are still found to be functioning in a normal way, more or less.

To a great extent, this is true. Only a person who has died, in the strictest physical sense, can realize exactly what portion of consciousness remains intact after death, and they are usually unable to send their report back to those who remain in the land of the living. A \"clinical death\" in a hospital, followed by a successful resuscitation, enhanced with visions of tunnels, lights and loved ones, cannot be considered a true death; although the heart may have temporarily stopped beating, the brain cells remain viable. The metaphysical literature is filled with accounts and descriptions of the after-death state and its processes; mediums continue to receive messages from the dearly-departed. Yet these elucidations are without controls and many other theories attempt to explain how such information is false or otherwise the product of intentional fraud or at least of \"wishful thinking.\" The psychedelic experience, a clinical death and resuscitation, the mystical states, and The Book of the Law, all tell us \"but there is that which remains.\" Each individual will have the opportunity to explore these matters when they take their final solo voyage. Along these clinical lines, Dr. Maurice Rawlings, a heart surgeon, tells about his patients as they died in his presence. He writes about many patients being resuscitated on the operating table and they speak to him about being in hell, where there is a real devil and demons and where the inhabitants are tormented with fire.

This route is composed of the following stages: l. Separation of the consciousness from the physical body. This may be assisted with a legal cannabinoid or psychedelic libation. Although rarely mentioned in the literature, this can be accomplished while still maintaining a minimal awareness of the physical body.

There is, of course, a third stage wherein the vertical ascent continues up through another veil to arrive at some semblance of primordial consciousness. This would be for the advanced initiates, or for an individual who has already gained this experience, perhaps in some prior existence, or anyone who simply demonstrates the stamina required. refer to: Atu II, \"the Priestess.\" THE LAMP \"Let the Dominus Liminis ... devise a Magick Lamp that shall burn without wick or oil, being fed by the Aethyr.\" -Liber A ™ The Magick Lamp is built as an instrument in the outer world and as a thoughtform on the inner planes.

Some might say, \"It is a star;\" another may describe a sun, while a third says, \"It was a radiant angel.\" There is no standardized archetype that will help here. One must simply endow their Lamp with all the qualities that they have seen. Every initiate of the first degree in any tradition that supports the concept of spiritual birth, or of a second birth, or of being born-again, who has truly achieved that degree in an inner sense, is carrying an image in their conscious memory of that Light So the magician takes that memory and sets it up as a constant thoughtform and synchronizes it with his or her external Lamp. Some may use a candle or even a photograph, but there is a reason for hanging the Lamp high up in the center of the circle, for this position reflects the highest mental subplane and its centralized dominance overshadows all other work. The inner Lamp can also be held internally at the center of some chakra, either the heart or the brow or the crown, even all three in their turn. The specific location will vary with the individual. The Lamp is only a thoughtform, but when its internal light is used as the focal point for aligning all of one's energies, then it can become the contact point with the Sun in the City of the Sun, just the other side of the Veil ofParoketh.

Surrender your keys means everyone reaches into their pocket or purse and gives their car keys to the attendant. This protects the participant and prevents long-range expeditions into the outer world in a vulnerable state. 2. Lock the Door means bolt all the doors of a dwelling; draw the curtains closed; seal the tent flap. There are no doors in the desert, so be aware. This prevents disturbances; a door-bell will not be answered, a knock will be ignored. 3. Unplug the Phone and turn off any other type of communication device connected to the worldwide grid. No outgoing messages, no incoming calls. 4. No Exit means each participant agrees to not leave, to not go beyond the Magickal Circle or some other pre-designated area, such as a house or a valley, for four hours. Calls of nature can be answered by using a pentagram upon leaving the circle, and the down-and-back sweeping hand motion is used when re-entering the circle. Of course, these crossings would not be made during an actual procedure such as invocation or evocation, purely for mental safety reasons. 5. Neglect not the Rituals means to initiate the ceremony with the bell and the libation, wait a space for effects, then banish and invoke, even if only sitting for Raja Yoga. \"Observers\" are never permitted. There are shamanic rites and the peyote rites of the Church, and there are the rituals of high ceremonial magic; any of these will establish a balanced \"set\" and an appropriate energy field in the \"setting.\" Any pre-designated specific rite or procedure is then enacted. This corresponds to The Clear Light. 6. The Sarcophagus is an asana, a posture. After the formal ceremonies are completed, the participants sit in chairs or upon a rock or even the Earth itself; soon there is likely to come upon any assembly a heaviness (\"body load\") that often requires the recumbent position. The Sarcophagus is the position of Dead Osiris on his Back, perhaps the most \"recumbent\" posture of them all; but any asana or comfortable position will do, for the idea is simply to relax and turn within (pratyahara).

This social-archetypal engagement will gradually give way to concerns of practicality in the world of \"harsh reality,\" and decisions will be made; plans will unfurl... This corresponds to the Bardo of Re-entry or to the approaching Horizon (Horus-zone) at the end of the Tuat. 8. Tick-Tock 4 o'clock means that the Rules of Engagement expire after four hours. This corresponds to the act of Reincarnation or to the Sunrise at the end of the Tuat. It automatically takes place at dawn, regardless of the number of hours, save that it must be at least four and no less. Keys can be returned; doors can be unlocked; phones can be reinstated. Yet it is common for no one person to do any of these things for many more hours - if they have such leisure time at hand.

The \"newer\" the candidates, the more \"phenomenal\" the energy will be demonstrated. In particular, first degree initiations tend to produce the greatest strain on the environment. This energy load may be described as a change in the vibratory ratio, which means the faster energy level is impacting matter and things are speeding up in frequency. \"Things\" means anything and everything in the immediate environment. The buildup of energy causes the environment to \"strain,\" to adjust to a slightly faster standard of beingness ... and then something breaks/ Perhaps several things will break. Two distinct observations have been made regarding these phenomena: • The weakest point or points in the environment are the ones that will break, burn-out, or otherwise fail.8 • Older, worn electromagnetic devices are particularly susceptible to failure when an increase in environmental background radiation is manifested. This \"background radiation\" is mental-astral-etheric in its mystical nature. Outwardly, it is magickal energy. Control of this energy during the preliminary phase takes place through the magickal principle known as The Labor of Preparation. In other words, keep a toolkit handy and don't get caught up in the drama when unexpected parts of the environment fail.

The Veil of Paroketh is a holographic, symbolic projection of the \"gap in consciousness\" that resides just below Tiphereth on the Tree of Life. This \"veil\" is the \"roof' of the fourth subplane of the manasic (mental) plane of consciousness. The internal view associated with this Veil is that of a kaleidoscopic visual display. The essence of the vision is the perception of the dazzling and coruscating, but asymmetrical, forms of the astral plane, out of which a symmetrical, kaleidoscopic thoughtform arises, stabilizes, and then splits [opens vertically] right down the middle.

It is universally understood throughout most cultures that a newly-departed person will have an escort to guide him or her from physical life into the afterlife. The escort may be an angel, a spirit, an animal or a dead relative. A Hermit-type figure in a black robe is common and if he carries a Death-like scythe, it is only to sever the energetic links with the physical body. The ancient Egyptians portrayed him as Anubis, the canine-headed deity of the embalmers. One common term for a Guide of this type is psychopomp. The psychpomp's role is never to judge, but only to lead. Carl Jung felt that the archetypal concept of the psychopomp filled the human need for a mediator between the conscious mind and the unconscious realms of the afterlife. This is the only Guide that an initiate, a psychonaught or a dead person will ever need. However, this true escort is often confused with other \"guides\" who are no more than astral entities enclosed in excessive glamor. American Indians, philosophers from Atlantis, space aliens from another dimension, and ascended Masters all crowd forth for attention from mediums, channels and a new age audience. The psychonaught is just as likely to contact his eternal Guide as any recently-departed person and it would really be helpful if he or she could only find this escort in the middle of a raging ocean of hallucinations.

This Guide is not the same as the Holy Guardian Angel; this Guide leads a person's consciousness to the Veil that stands before the shrine of that Solar Deva. THE GUARD A Guard, in the spiritual sense, is an entity who is associated with a veil or a door or a gate. All of the mystical gates in the mythical kingdoms have attendants or guards.

Any libation of the AMD.\", triad mimics serotonin; this is another one of those keys that is applicable at all levels of consciousness: 'You must become the Guard!\" - just as the psychedelic molecule \"becomes\" serotonin. Here is an oral transmission related to this subject: • As a person's individualized, sentient awareness is distilled out of primordial consciousness, various levels and planes and spheres are traversed, until one arrives at Terra Firma, the realm of \"hard matter and harsh reality.\" • The dividing line between some specific planes or sub-planes consists of a \"gap in consciousness,\" called a veil, a door, a gate; these barriers can be compared to the expansive neutral zone of the Galactic Federation. • On \"the way down\" into incarnation each person sets a Guard at each of these veils and gates. The person will not be able to return through these barriers unless they \"know the Guard's name\" or they can \"speak the password.\" This is simply mystical jargon that means the person must become the Guard."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"• These Guards are not the same as the psychopomp Guide or the Holy Guardian Angel; these Guards may appear as frightening demons or benevolent angels; they are but aspects of a person's psychological character that need to be equilibrated.

If the vision is that of a brilliant Sun or a Star, then this is an encounter with The Secondary Clear Light; if the vision is that of other things, then this is the time to \"go for the Light\" by looking toward the brightest part of any imagery. All that glitters is not gold, nor god to boot, so look for the whitest pixel in any scene. Only when one is directly facing this inner Sun can it be said that they are truly standing in the Temple of Ra. There is nothing but Central Light imagery.

In association with the Angel's coming into consciousness, some people will encounter a triad of hooded men, dimly sensed or directly perceived, and this is common enough when an initiation is taking place.9 This triad is the bearer of the light, for the transmission is always three into one. Everyone comes to know some type of an Angel, a Firebird, a Star or a Human form. This is the knowledge of the Holy Guardian Angel.

THE VEIL The Temple of Ra in the City of the Sun is divided in two. Is not the grade of Adeptus Minor, the initiate of Heliopolis, split into designations of without and within? Does not the Illuminati recognize both an Epopt and a Pontiff? But here there is no great gap in consciousness to be crossed, no heavy veil to be pierced. This veil is light, like gauze, and it simply differentiates the Observer from the Participant. First comes the vision, which is followed by the voice. THE DIALOG A dialog with Ra is the conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It is a two-way discussion with one's soul, a chat with The Secondary Clear Light. This conversation takes place through the medium of symbols; there is no accent or cultural twang; the words are supplied by the participant's brain, and this in such a manner that it seems just like simple talk. The words and symbols can even sometimes be written, and wonderful accounts arise. PERSPECTIVE If one encounters a meaningful dialog with The Secondary Clear Light in a stable vision while entranced in an alchemical way, that is, with a libation, this is a high state indeed, even for an experienced psychonaught But one must take care to not proclaim, even to one's self alone, that one has accomplished the Great Work.

It might be added that this initiation (the Transfiguration) is taken on the three higher levels of the mental plane, and that it is therefore upon the fourth level of the mental plane that the aspirant first of all stands before the door, seeking initiation.\"    -Alice Bailey \" THE THREE HIGHER levels of the mental plane are called the first, the second and the third subplanes; the Qabalist and the magician call them Chesed and Geburah and Tiphereth. These are really not separated like elements, but rather they are phases of The Secondary Clear Light. The City of the Sun is harmony and beauty alike; The Citadel of Horus is fiery and active; The House of Mercy is cool and compassionate. These are called by the Hindu: Tamas, Rajas and Sattva. An operator on the second subplane, Geburah, is utilizing Magical Powers of the \"so-called second rank.\" This mysterious ranking system allots Magical Powers of the first rank to the workings of the monad, the star, that are conducted beyond even the mental plane, above the abyss, and therefore exert their effects among human consciousness at large. The second-ranked Powers, under consideration here, are conducted on the abstract, higher mental plane. Their cause and their effect may be under solar (soul) control, but they are still manipulated to a greater or lesser degree by the ego, which is alive and aware. Thus, these Powers of the second rank will mainly affect the individual's subjective consciousness and potentially that of his or her associates, lineage or group. This does not mean that there will not be objective changes"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"I ,ni US( .III' > in the external world, for there will usually be plenty of that sort of thing. Magical Powers of the third rank are relegated to the personality and the realm of hallucinations on the astral plane. These are almost always works of personal selfishness, black magic as it were, and they are usually not very powerful, but they surely can cause a lot of mischief. MAGICK The Magick of Mars (rajas; \"activity\") functions in this manner: The initiate or the psychonaught, as a result of his or her dialog with the inner Sun, Ra the Magnificent, The Secondary Clear Light, undertakes an adjustment of his or her consciousness. This is merely an indicative statement that means the person sees things from a different perspective and thus the world appears different. You shift your assemblage point - and you change the world. This is the basis of the popular phrase, 'You create your own reality.\" This is completely true; but the creation took place a long time ago up in the supernal realm of the Monad, and even the adjustment of reality is confined to the plane of The Secondary Clear Light. New Age enthusiasts happily employ third-rank Magic in the form of affirmations, the purposeful creation of dense thoughtforms, plus dynamic astral finessing, to aid in their wishful thinking that is mostly defined by personal prosperity. These are not necessarily \"bad,\" but they form a complex set of practices that usually, but not always, are completely selfish in their motivation. But at the solar level, the Light \"tells,\" that is, it directly shows, the participant what needs to be changed. You see, the dialog is not all flowery words, mystical symbols and magickal delight. The incoming radiance will energize the person's vehicles -and the weakest point, the most illusory circuit, will becomc overloaded and cry out for attention. The dialog can quickly become a lesson. The \"lesson\" includes a revealing of the illusion, along with ;i"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"shift in perspective that reveals what action (rajas) must be taken. It is all crystal clear. The first time this takes place, the initiate can truly be said to have \"discovered his or her Will.\" There are, of course, more advanced forms of Will still to come. In order to affect a permanent change, the \"action\" will take place in Geburah, first as an acceptance in solar consciousness, then followed by some type of corresponding activity in the outer world; perhaps a simple ceremony performed in the Bardo of Re-entry, or some other project undertaken after days or weeks or months have passed. Sooner or later, a shift in inner perspective will bring about an analogous setting in the external world. All of the above is greatly accelerated with alchemical preparations. Basic Rites For the ceremonial magician, there are only three procedures with which he or she need be familiar: Banishing, Invocation and Evocation. BANISHING involves clearing a space, preferably a circle - ideally a sphere, of all influences. It is similar to creating a vacuum, and its manifestation is stillness and calm and clarity. Any ritual will do: The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, The Star Ruby, The Star of Force and Fire, The Smoke and Drum of the Shaman, The Long Horns and Trumpets of Tibet. The ideal agenda for libation-enhanced banishing is to arrange the temple, take the medicine, wait until the first effects are felt, then banish. If one performs the rite earlier, then the ritual is not yet enhanced; if one waits much longer, then the hallucinations may have begun and, if they have gained the upper hand, banishing may become more difficult. As a completely separate exercise, it is always interesting to perform a banishing alone on an open plain after the main ceremony has been closed, yet still during the time of libation-effect. Nighttime might be best, but it really doesn't matter. Until one has experienced the flow and the effects of a magickal rite in an altered state of awareness, however induced, it is safe to assume that one still has more to learn about that ritual."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"( nl MM Jin After one has experienced the effects of a rite in an altered state of awareness, even once, it is safe to assume that one has pretty much come to understand that ritual. It is one thing to have done a banishing ritual four times a day for a year, projecting fiery pentagrams out to the imaginary event horizon and then centering and aligning one's personal energies in preparation for invocation. It is another thing to do this banishing in an altered state in the desert, quickly coming to realize that the pentagrams are just symbols that unleash a rolling wave of electric fire that energizes and purifies anything it encounters, and seeing that wave radiate out for miles. After this, the daily banishing in ordinary consciousness will be forever enhanced to a greater or a lesser degree. INVOCATION is the \"calling down\" of a deity from a more expanded sphere of consciousness into the cleared circle. Any invocation will do. Some invocations are \"better\" (more potent) than others, but this is strictly a matter of individual preferences based on experience. The invocation normally follows immediately after the banishing. In a group setting, one person may banish and another will invoke. The effects of invocation, when libation-enhanced, will be more pronounced in comparison to similar activities in ordinary consciousness; one will come to understand the definition of \"results.\" These two gestures, banishing and invocation, set the tone for the remainder of the ceremony. It is not enough to read them from a book or a scroll; they must be memorized and automatic in their delivery. This, alone, is enough to radically shift a group ceremony into dimensions that might not be easily available with a passive indulgence in the medicine alone - without Magick. The mystic and the advanced magician may simply employ internal astral-mental clearing techniques and substitute an object of concentration (dharana) or devotion (bhakti) for the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"external banishing and invocation. However, the combined practices of external ceremonial magick and Raja Yoga remain in the forefront of any recommendations, especially in the early stages. EVOCATION is the \"summoning forth\" or \"calling up\" of a spirit or a demon from a more restricted realm of awareness into visible manifestation inside a triangle just outside the cleared and illumined circle. The evocation normally follows immediately after the invocation. In a group setting, the same person who did the invocation will usually perform the evocation; for he or she will need all the \"godform\" energy that is available. If advanced magicians are in attendance, acid-masters tried and true, there will undoubtedly be a reason why they are dealing with an evocation of some particular demon. If one is new to the world of the psychonaught and the mysteries of the magician, it would be foolish to press ahead into evocation with liberating medicine simply because it works, just like one might imagine when reading Magick by Therion, except this will be real! A wise practitioner will not go looking for trouble, especially in the beginning. One need look no further than the exploits of Mickey the Mouse as he wields his Master's wand in The Sorcerer's Apprentice - an animated archetype that has been presented to the masses as a fantastic familiar example. But then there might be a problem wherein a demon will just jump up and suddenly kick a beginner in the behind, even without any evocation or \"calling forth.\" It is important to understand that the gods and the spirits are aspects of one's self -at one level or another - even though this fact will not be fully realized until one has had a meaningful dialog with The Secondary Clear Light. In particular, demons are workers from subterranean caverns; that means they are subconscious complexes. Any neurosis or pending psychosis, lying dormant beneath the threshold of ordinary consciousness, may arise under the influence of alchemical medicine. These may manifest as"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"( nnisc.lMi obsessions or compulsions or incoherence; people who are under this type of \"possession\" can easily be recognized as they take on the appearance of an imp or a horned devil or some other bizarre expression. Fortunately, allowing for the rapid action of a libation, the matter is usually resolved in a few minutes without residual effects, although some people have been known (rarely) to remain \"affected\" for several hours. Overall, the number of people who leave the circle gently purged of such possessions greatly overshadows the tiny minority who retain some side-effects, and no-one seems to ever be permanently affected, even if the scientific literature says they might be. The point is, there are sometimes demons to be consciously evoked into an external triangle and there are \"spirits\" that may appear from within, from \"beneath,\" and somebody who is present will hopefully be competent in magickal evocation and mystical exorcism. The effects of evocation, when libation-enhanced, will be more pronounced in comparison to similar activities in ordinary consciousness; these are the forces that can cause the neighbor's garage to burst into flames ... accidentally, of course. It's called collateral damage. • • Specific Rites Some rituals of tantra yoga and the ceremonies of the Lion and the Eagle are specifically related to this second subplane, the Citadel of Geburah. Enough has been written in the esoteric literature about these sexual rites that there is no need to go over it again. But here is a single clue; it is symbolized it the three dots: • • • The two lower dots represent the brow (ajna) chakra or \"the light in the head\" of each participant; the uppermost dot represents the \"center way above the head,\" sometimes called the ninth chakra.

The practices of the ancient Taoist priests describe a further modification of these principles. At the moment of orgasm, preferably simultaneous in both parties, the orgasmic energy is directed up the sushumna, the central channel, toward the heart, the brow, and the star overhead. This type of culmination offers complete release with total corporeal and spiritual satisfaction, yet there is no ejaculate. This kundalini technique is portrayed rather clearly in The Book of the Law... \"I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy.

Soul Mates When a person is under the influence of a libation, it may easily come to pass that they look at another person and they \"fall in love.\" This might take place in one or more of three areas. These areas may include: (l) the basic reproductive sex drive of the animal kingdom, (2) human personality compatibility and attraction, and (3) spiritual magnetism - and the concept of soul mates. Everyone is really on their own as far as the first two areas are concerned; it's just that there's something in this human survival circuit that endows the personal, reproductive energy with an \"eternal relationship\" quality. Of course, it often turns out to be temporary, because it's a trick played on consciousness by the genetic life force that keeps the species in production.131 This overshadowing of the reproductive process by an"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"( < H UM .111' eternal-spiritual archetype is the source of the soul mate controversy and, after a while, it can get quite expanded and terribly complicated in a big way when a psychedelic libation is involved. Which is too bad, because it all seemed so clear and simple at the time. As everyone well knows, most love affairs that flash the archetypal \"eternally-entwined\" symbol end up in estrangement, separation and divorce. Sometimes there is great hostility in the departure. There is a whole field of behavioral psychology open for study here, but basically the cultivated personalities, the superficial people who at first seemed so attractive, turn out to be a completely different character when placed in close contact with each other for a period of time. Repressed complexes, held rigorously in check in the superficial public arena, tend to open up and reveal themselves in closer private relationships. Gurus and teachers often encounter this same scenario, in reverse, with their students. The student, attracted by spiritual magnetism, interprets the energy as sexual desire; then the guru has to explain the difference. How many times have you seen the concept of the soul-mate in action, and even heard that exact term used? It hardly ever works out to be satisfactory in the long run because the idea of \"soul mates\" is one of the most illusionary and glamorous of the many metaphysical concepts. One's true soul mate is the Solar Angel. In a sexual relationship, one can (sometimes) see their Angel overshadowing, or manifesting in, the other person, especially in a psychedelic state. A glimmer of this possibility is what creates \"star-struck lovers,\" for they are unable to differentiate between themselves and the universal Lovers (see Atu XI); they confuse the mystical marriage with the rite of matrimony. The advanced magician or yogi is able to discriminate between the physical relationship and the archetypal process.

If the relationship is long-term, as in"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"marriage or cohabitation or a life-long friendship, and both are initiates, this would be rare, but certainly not unheard of. It's simply that these matters (sex, magick, archetypal overshadowing, libation, karma), when mixed together, often provide explosive results - which is exactly why these subjects are being presented in this chapter on the Citadel of Mars. Nothing written herein can be taken as a guideline or as a statement of universal principle; none of this provides instruction or gives a rule. It is all merely listed with a few comments and observations because these are things that may be encountered. A soul mate has further been defined as anyone with whom you have had a karmic exchange in the past. There is also the concept of several souls who come into incarnation together, or at least in the same general time zone, and this constitutes a soul group, each member being a soul mate, usually with the ability to recognize each other. Additionally, there is the idealized image of the Twin Flames. This represents two souls who pass through many incarnations in conjunction with each other, or perhaps for all eternity. One or all of these scenarios can be running in synchronization with a fleeting or a lasting relationship on the physical plane. The mischief comes in when one falls in love, and perceives this union as eternal and everlasting and assumes it will be forever perfect, or otherwise manages to confuse the planes. Polar Switch It relation to this matter of polarity reversal, that is, a swapping of gender, a couple can actually temporarily transmigrate into each other's physical body, undertaking a complete sex reversal, or at least this is what appears to take place under certain circumstances involving ceremonial activity and magickal libation.

The three types of transmission are: Oral, symbolic and direct. ORAL TRANSMISSION occurs through speaking and listening, or through writing and reading. Through the \"Power of the Word,\" the brain translates these utterances and scripts into mental concepts and practical applications. Such ideas are transmitted through conversations, speeches, and books. Certain words of power pronounced during ceremonies have a similar, if not more potent, effect. SYMBOLIC TRANSMISSION takes place through emblems, symbols, insignia, icons, and works of art like statues, paintings, and talismans. Initiation ceremonies are composed of symbolic rites that usually include oral transmission, and (if genuine) contain a central act of direct transmission. Sometimes libations are used in these rituals, by the candidate or the officers, or both. DIRECT TRANSMISSION takes place without words or symbols, even though they may be utilized as part of a ceremonial transfer. This is similar to \"grace\" or the giving and reception of a gift. The initiatory current of transmission flows from a point of light into a triad into a point of light... ad infinitum. It is also reflected in the transmission of light down through the levels of consciousness within an individual; thus we have terms like the triplefold personality, the triune nature of the soul and the supernal triad."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"(!<>nisc;iii< The symbology of the triad, whether labeled triangle, trine, trinity, triune or triple is built into the initiatory process and in the direct transmission of light.

On a more mundane level, this dual relationship is reflected in the association between a chela and a guru, a student and a teacher, or a candidate and a single hierophant. A guru is often capable of delivering, transferring or \"transmitting\" certain insights, mystical powers or levels of consciousness, one-on-one, to a recipient. Sometimes, the delivery is from the eyes of the transmitter, for there are accounts of certain holy men whose glance, if they simply look at you, causes your consciousness to radically change."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"( ..HUM .ILL11 Sometimes the reception is through the eyes of the beholder during darshan.13 External initiation ceremonies invariably contain a central act of direct transmission; this is symbolized when the initiating officer touches some part of the candidate's body with his or her hand or with a magickal instrument such as a sword or a wand. Whether or not the Light, the power (siddhi), or the ability to enter an alternate dimension in consciousness is actually transmitted within such a symbolic ceremonial setting can only be determined by the results; that is, either it works or it doesn't work ! Of course, some time has to go by before making such a differentiation, because many people come close to a guru or ceremonially enter a temple and afterward they are ecstatically elevated - for a while. Then it wears off. This type of \"contact high\" results from exposure to a powerful energy field wherein a person is temporarily polarized into a superior alignment, but nothing has been transmitted of a permanent nature. The \"contact high\" is common with psychedelic libations. People who have taken no substance will come into the vicinity of a psychonaught who is in a non-ordinary state of consciousness. The \"normal\" people will then begin to see and feel things just like they had taken some of the alchemical elixir themselves. DIRECT TRANSMISSION Although words and symbols may play a part, Empowerments are usually short and direct. These are the same as an \"initiation.\" If the initiate is able to demonstrate the siddhi or the insight that was transmitted or initiated, of their own accord, without reinforcement or assistance, a year after the ceremony, then it probably worked. For you see, the average, demonstrated length of altered consciousness resulting from a \"contact high\" keeps coming in at right around six weeks. An Empowerment is a rite that initiates a student into a particular practice or level of consciousness. The Tibetan word for this is Wang, which literally translates to \"power.\" 13 Darshan = \"the act of viewing a holy man - or woman\""},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The details of an empowerment ritual are often kept secret as are the specific details of the transmitted practice. Although there may be several lamas or \"officers\" involved in formal empowerment ceremonies, especially when it is a group procedure, each candidate in the assembly eventually stands alone before the one initiator to receive the transmission. Sometimes the rite is less formal, being a direct transmission from guru to student with no other person involved. And sometimes a medicinal libation is employed. Some classes of Tibetan lamas are noted for the employment of herbal formulae to enhance the effectiveness of their ceremonies and the consciousness of the participants. Empowerments are not restricted to Tibet or mysterious Asia. They are inherent in ancient shamanic practices, historical initiation ceremonies and modern transmissions. As with any known \"esoteric\" technique, symbol or word, the term Empowerment has been captured and promoted by the New Age community. In these cases, the enticement to participate, and the true goal, is most often found in the ultimate word of worldly power: Prosperity. Give me money. It's that same black magic all over again.

The \"oneness,\" the unity, that is highly esteemed in the mystical literature, is \"becoming one with\" some higher, more expanded, deeper level of consciousness. The highest (deepest) singularity available to human consciousness is called the Monad and the Qabalists attribute it to the first sphere, Kether. It manifests as the Supernal Triad and it can be seen looking out, from the center of that Triangle; it is the sparkle of an Eye. - Online encyclopedia BLACK HOLE FLSSJGFFLOQFIFLBG"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"When that Eye of Shiva, that same Eye of Horns, opens, everything that has gone before is annihilated. A willed relaxation and unconditional surrender renders the procedure painless. Yet the recurring singularity appears over and over again at major levels along the spiritual path, the so-called Lighted Way, and not simply as a matter of at-one-ment with Kether. The same symbolic archetypal pattern comes into play at each of the levels: One into three into one into three into one ... THE SEQUENCE OF SINGULARITIES Starting from the hard physical plane, and working upward (or going deeper inside), these are the major singularities: • The Aspirant, a single human being, a self-evident, individualized, sentient point of awareness, recognizes and controls his or her triple nature [physical, emotional & mental], bringing these three aspects into alignment with the Light of the Soul, the Holy Guardian Angel. This process can be assisted, to a certain extent, with the use of legal cannabinoids as a liberating medicine. • Viewed directly, this Light of the Soul is a star, although it may appear to the initiate as a Sun or a Bird or a Man, depending on the initiate's ray and karma. This singularity becomes a duality, the dialog with The Secondary Clear Light. The triple nature of the Soul then radiates and expands to its fullest, eventually passing out into the void of the abyss through a black triangle. This procedure can be enhanced with legal AMDplants, extracts or alchemical derivatives. • The black triangle, the void zone of the Ego, manifests a minute point of Light in its center; this grows to be a Star. It is The Primary Clear Light that will bring Liberation; it brings cessation of duality; it is a not-self singularity within a black triangle; these are the pyramids in the city of those who have Mastered their Temple."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"This sequence is repeated again on still higher levels. The attainment of a singularity, which is always a form of meditation (dhyana) upon a central light source, is invariably followed by a threefold radiance that ends up being a triangular gateway that allows consciousness to proceed through the dark veil to an even more \"elevated\" singularity. This symbolic, often highly visual, imagery assumes that the psychonaught or the initiate stays centered and balanced. The entire sequence may become bogged down or fragmented due to the \"modifications of the thinking principle\" of any given individual at any given time under various circumstances. For one thing, each person has a built-in safety net, an actual sanity-net, metaphysically called a \"ring-pass-not\" or a Veil. Think of it as serotonin, the stable guardian who suppresses unnecessary information. A libation allows -the ordinary, waking consciousness to bypass the guardian, to travel beyond the normally rigid veil. But there are several levels of concentric veils, many coinciding spheres. Any person will only get as far as they can penetrate through one or more veils in a balanced manner. With liberating medicine, the first veil is automatically opened, although it is common to \"go\" for the first time with some experienced guide in close proximity. If anyone gets \"too far out,\" they will simply black out. This marks the limit of their \"expanded\" consciousness and determines their potential initiatory designation (grade, degree, title, etc). They have \"seen\" what they now need to work toward. Their operative initiatory designation would be whatever they could contact \"at will\" in ordinary, un-enhanced consciousness. Their formal initiatory designation would be whatever is written on their certificate, which has nothing to do with the potential or the operative designations.. Also, the neophyte need not be discouraged, for a person who starts out by being tossed hither and yon by the sea of hallucinations can be in direct attendance to The Clear Light a session or two later, perhaps only a matter of weeks or a few months.

When it comes down to identifying one's real, operative level or degree, it merely depends on what \"expansion\" can be accessed by a person's ordinary consciousness, \"at will.\" There is an universal principle which decrees that the crisis of an initiatory degree must be undertaken in full, waking consciousness. Only in this way can the higher level of awareness be permanently fixed in place. Libations will alter the normal consciousness, so psychedelic encounters can normally be viewed only as an inherent potential or a preview of coming attractions. Thus we often see the true inner initiations taking place in the daily life of ordinary reality; the visions and the reactions are the same as, or similar to, the scenarios brought about by alchemical libation, but in these cases, no such thing has been taken.

When an atom is split, the energy that held the nucleus intact is released in the form of light, heat and radiation. A similar energy holds the human unit intact; when consciousness separates from the body, at death, in meditation, during astral projection, or at the moment of falling asleep, a flash of light is a common occurrence. Surely you have experienced that bright light, rarely seen and remembered yet common enough, which flares like a strobe just as you cross into sleep, pulling your awareness back into waking consciousness? If it becomes apparent that the Primary Clear Light has not been recognized and grasped, then there comes the phase of the Secondary Clear Light. NOTE: In many cases, with the use of liberating medicine, it is customary for the psychonaught to not glimpse the Light or any light at the beginning of an experiment.

This dialog has been called The knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It can take many forms. In this second stage of the First Bardo, both the mystical non-self and the mystical self are experienced - simultaneously. This is a very sensitive level of consciousness.

The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is a summary of the western medieval world-view as it pertained to theology. Like Bardo Thodol and The Book of Gates, it is divided into three major parts: Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. Superficially, the tale describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven; but at a deeper level it depicts the soul's journey toward God. Abstract Dante enters a dark, forbidding forest, representing his own corporeality and the materialism of the world at large. At the top of a hill in the distance, he sees a light. Dante has recognized The Primary Clear Light. When he attempts to climb toward the light, a leopard, a lion, and a wolf block his way. Dante has failed to grasp The Clear Light and he enters the hallucinatory realm. Virgil, representative of Anubis the Guide and The Holy Guardian Angel, appears in order to rescue him. Virgil offers to escort Dante from the forest by another route that leads through Hell."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Q.m.iscaiio Then they proceed up the mountain of Purgatory, where Dante will renounce sin and eradicate himself of it. Finally, the path leads to Heaven, where Beatrice, a woman Dante had loved before her death, will become his guide as Virgil returns to whence he came, for reason alone cannot ascend to the heights of paradise. Dante agrees to make the journey, and they depart. INFERNO Hellfire and Brimstone Dante is lost in the dark woods, where he becomes consciously aware that he is ruining his life and falling into a \"deep place\" where the sun is silent. He is rescued by Virgil and the two of them begin their journey into the underworld. In Inferno, each sin's punishment is a symbolic example of poetic justice wherein Dante recognizes \"sin\" for what it is: the Law of Cause and Effect."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"I IM i , jln) PURGATORY Climbing the Mountain Having come through the depths of Hell, Dante and Virgil ascend from the gloomy subterranean pits to the Mountain of Purgatory. The mountain has seven terraces, corresponding to the \"seven roots of sinfulness.\" Based on motives, the classification of sin here in Purgatory is more psychological than that of the Inferno, where the allotment of punishment was derived from actions. Beatrice appears among Angels At the top of the mountain, Virgil departs and Beatrice takes over as the guide to the higher planes. PARADISE The Nine Spheres of Heaven Beatrice takes Dante through the nine divine levels of Heaven, which are concentric spheres. Dante meets and discourses with various saints, a correspondence to the Peaceful Deities of the Bardo."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Dante admits that his vision of Heaven is merely the one that his human eyes permit him to see, and that this image of Heaven is his own personal view. The Divine Comedy finishes with Dante seeing the Triune God. In a flash of understanding, which he cannot explain, he comes to understand the divine mystery. \"But already my desire and my will were being turned like a wheel, all at one speed, by the Love which moves the sun and the other stars.\" - Dante Dante has presented an unique expose of the intermediate state that spans the gap of time and space between death and rebirth. It also portrays the initiatory path. Although heavily laced with the imagery and theology of the European Middle Ages, it stands as a great work that is summed up in this single line from The Book of the Law: \"The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest.\" The psychonaught of western civilization is rather likely to encounter Dante's type of imagery simply because the European Middle Ages paradigm is firmly stamped into our racial and cultural unconsciousness. Summary Note of the Appendices: Each Appendix is a map of the realm of the collective unconscious; the map is not the territory, but it bestows a certain sense of direction. The present Atomic Age is the outgrowth of the European Middle Ages paradigm, which rose up out of Rome, whose parent was Greece, which was Egypt taken to a new level; and Egypt inherited the magick of Sumer that was founded by immigrants \"from the East.\" \"It's those damn Eastern teachings !\" - Rev.

This entire story is told in great detail in the books, Inside Solar lodge - Outside the Law, and Inside Solar lodge - Behind the Veil. After leaving Solar Lodge he continued his quest and became involved with The Lighted Way in thei97o's ... The Lighted Way was an externalized Ashram associated with the Master Djwhal Khul in the tradition of the Transhimalayan White Brotherhood. It was administered by Muriel \"Isis\" Domer, the most powerful physical-plane magician Shiva ever came to know. The curriculum included channeling, tarot, numerology (the 0 to 21 version of the Qabalah), kundalini meditation, full moon meditations, observation of the Solstices and the Equinoxes, how-to do readings, how-to do lectures, and how-to do healing. This was a group, but it had no dictator, used no drugs and everyone was free to come and go as they willed. Each person paid separately for each lesson, but it was very inexpensive (three to five dollars). There was no communal living - a sure way to ensure less strife. This is the lineage of Blavatsky and Bailey, the gateway to Tibet and Shamballa. Just as Crowley came to elucidate (\"make clear\") the work started by H.P. Blavatsky, so Bailey stepped in to clear up what is really going on in terms of the initiatory degrees."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Shiva had pledged himself to perform the Ritual of the VHIth Aethyr, calling upon his \"Angel\" that he had already met and spoken with once before, and yet he received the internal instruction to assist Isis in her unfolding task. Such a crisis! As the City of the Sun manifested, these conflicts faded into harmony. The whole of life began to unfold in a golden rainbow hue. Here is how it happened and this story is true: Shiva decided to first complete the Vlllth Aethyr, then to turn in service to Isis' Ashram of the Universal Mother. It was Isis who described the place where he could accomplish this task, and in the middle of the operation (just after the application of the rod of initiation) Isis publicly confirmed his initiation in front of the whole assembly. Then, having made his own internal connection, he went on to assist Isis in building a physical plane Ashram that was (for about two years) officially proclaimed as ... THE PRIMARY FOCAL POINT OF THE PLANETARY HIERARCHY ON THE PHYSICAL PLANE. A strong claim indeed. Many had a good laugh at that! One would need to have been there to think it was possibly true. The overshadowing of this group operation was so strong that there was nothing but light, prosperity, health and ongoing, daily ecstasy. This was powerful stuff, lighter in light and lighter in weight than the group energy of Solar Lodge. Isis published her book, reaching 7°=4d, then revealed herself as a Master - as it all blew up! Just like Solar Lodge - with this exception: When Capricomus of Solar Lodge was told by her inner voice, 'The Gates of Initiation are Closed! Send everyone away!\" she responded by saying \"I will never do that!\" Talk about asking for trouble. When Isis of The Lighted way was told by her inner voice to \"Graduate anyone who's been with you for more than a year! Send them on their way!\" she responded by saying, \"I don't want to do that!\" for three whole days. Then she relented and formally graduated a large group of initiates. There was no explosion. These ashrams that are \"hot,\" that is, they really open to other dimensions in one direction or another (or both) - they cannot stand open for long.
