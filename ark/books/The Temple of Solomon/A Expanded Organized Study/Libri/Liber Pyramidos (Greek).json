[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" BLACK PEARL 46 The Ritual of the Pyramid (Greek Adaptation) 000. The Building of the Pyramid. [Aleister Crowley’s self-initiation ritual, Liber Pyra-midos, was an adaptation of the AA 1=10 ritual, Liber aurt. The Egyptian form is well known. What generally is not known is that the earliest form employed a Greek pantheon: The mysterious “Alpha Delta Epsilon Iota” of the Opening are the initials of the names Hades, Demeter, Hermes, and Iacchus. The whole ritual, viewed thus, is the legend of “The Passage of Persephone Through Tartarus,” the initiation of the Daughter or Pure Soul of Malkuth unto her rightful heritage. Original drafts have not survived. I created the adaptation following for a stage of my personal Work, retrofitting the ritual to the pantheon of Greece in a period when she was heavily influenced by Egyptian importation. – Fra.

Whose serpents strain Their bodies, bounding the Beyond. Thou in the Light & in the Night Art One, above their moving might! He lays the wand, etc., on the altar, uses the scourge on his buttocks, cuts a cross with the dagger upon his breast, and tightens the chain of the bell about his forehead, saying: The Lustral Water! Smite thy flood Through me – lymph, marrow & blood! Anointing the wounds, say: The Fire Informing! Let the Oil Balance, assain, assoil! Invoking (deosil) Spiral Dance, while saying: So Life takes Fire from Death, & runs Whirling amid the Suns. Earth Mother! Pace the Path, bind on The girdle of the Starry One!
