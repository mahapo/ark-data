Two years earlier Reusshad presented Crowley with honorarymembership in the O.T.O.,presumably in hopes it would bolsterCrowley's esoteric credentials in alawsuit that had been filed against himby S. L. MacGregor Mathers, the headof the London-based Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn.Mathers had sued to preventCrowley from publishing proprietaryinitiation rituals and teachings of theG.D. in his publication, The Equinox.In the suit, Mathers was claiming tobe the worldwide head of the“Rosicrucians,” an act of spiritualpresumption which outraged Reussand the leaders of a score of other"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"existing European Hermetic andRosicrucian societies. In an attempt todilute Mathers' credentials in the eyesof the court these organizationslavished a host of honorary degreesand titles upon Crowley—so manythat he completely lost track of hisvarious memberships, degrees andmystic titles. Crowley eventually wonthe suit and published The Equinox.The purpose of the June, 1912 visitfrom Reuss, however, was not todiscuss the lawsuit or Golden Dawnmatters, but to take Crowley to taskfor publishing the O.T.O.'s supremesecret of sexual magick. Crowleyprotested that he had done no suchthing, and that in fact, he didn't even"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"know the secret and was completelyunaware that the O.T.O. had anythingto do with sex magick.Reuss stepped to Crowley's ownbookshelf and plucked out a copy ofLiber CCCXXXIII: The Book of Lies2and opened it to chapter 36, The StarSapphire, a short version of theHexagram Ritual.Crowley did not immediatelyunderstand exactly how the contentsof this tiny chapter could possiblyreveal the supreme secret of sexualmagick, so Ruess patiently discussedwhat he had written vis a vis certaintheoretical and aspects of magick. Heled the discussion in such a way thatCrowley experienced an almost"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"instant epiphany. He was stunned.Since childhood he had intuited theimportance and the potential power ofsex. But here, in the most profoundand simple terms, was the key – notonly to the mythological symbolismof the ancients, of Christianity andFreemasonry, but (theoretically atleast) the key to the mysteries ofhuman consciousness and creationitself.Before the afternoon had passed,Ruess had conferred upon Crowley(and his lover, Leila Waddell) thehighest initiatory degree of theO.T.O., the IX°, and obligated them tothe discretionary terms of itscommunication. This ‘oath of secrecy’"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"is a somewhat paradoxical obligation.Rather than being an oath not to revealthe secret to the world, it is rathermore a promise to perpetuate thesecret, to assure that it is protected,preserved, and never profaned,diluted, corrupted or lost.One doesn't learn a true magicalsecret like one learns a juicy piece ofgossip. A true magical secret is a lightbulb that goes off over your own headwhen you finally “get” something. Inother words, the IX° initiate of theO.T.O. is not obligated to conceal the“secret” but on the contrary, obligatedto make sure as many worthyindividuals as possible discover thesecret by discerning it themselves."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Crowley took this obligation veryseriously, and his writings on thisparticular subject (as we will see inthis Best of the Equinox volume onSex Magick) can be very difficult tounderstand. They are full of strange,sometimes disturbing and confusingsymbolic language that Crowleybelieved clearly revealed everythingthere was to reveal to anyone ready tohave everything revealed to them.I must confess, this is not easy.

It brings to mind visions ofcostumed orgies and pornographicacts of dramatic depravity.

As you willsee, the most obvious differencebetween the Crowley's Mass andChristian Masses is the presence ofboth a Priest and a Priestess. Onewould correctly assume that theparticular sex magick technique theGnostic Mass deals with is one that isaccomplished by one man and onewoman. Variations on the theme ofthis central secret, however, make italso privately amendable for solitary,homosexual and non-sexual workings(Crowley's diaries are full of suchexperiments). Liber XV, the GnosticMass (as written and as officially and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"publicly celebrated), however, doesnot reflect or specificallyaccommodate these other variations inits officers, order of ceremony orformulae.Anyone who is even slightlyfamiliar with Aleister Crowley and hiswork knows that he was nothomophobic. His Gnostic Mass is nota biological, cultural, political ormagical statement on the virtues ofheterosexual relationships.

And thisalthough the rites themselves areceremonially equivalent. Thereshould, however, be one symboldeclaring the transcending of suchlimitations; and with regard to theDeity also, there should be some oneaffirmation of his identity both withall other similar gods of other nations,and with the Supreme of whom all arebut partial reflections."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"3 .

And the dearestspot therein shall be the shrine of histemple. It is most convenient if thisshrine and altar should be sequesteredin woods, or in a private grove, orgarden. But let it be protected fromthe profane.4 . Concerning the Image of theDeity. Let there be an image of theDeity; first, because in meditationthere is mindfulness induced thereby;and second, because a certain powerenters and inhabits it by virtue of theceremonies; or so it is said, and We"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"deny it not.

Further concerning the shrine.Let this shrine be furnishedappropriately as to its ornaments,according to the book 777.

Further, it is well to support theshrine with talismans of the planets,signs and elements appropriate. Butthese should be made according to theright Ingenium of the Philosophus bythe light of the Book 777 during thecourse of his Devotion. It is also well,nevertheless, if a magick circle withthe right signs and names be madebeforehand.6. Concerning the ceremonies.

Further concerning theceremonies. Let then this Invocationbe the principal part of an orderedceremony. And in this ceremony letthe Philosophus in no wise neglect theservice of a menial. Let him sweepand garnish the place, sprinkling itwith water or with wine as isappropriate to the particular Deity,and consecrating it with oil, and withsuch ritual as may seem him best. Andlet all be done with intensity andminuteness.8 . Concerning the period ofdevotion, and the hours thereof. Let afixed period be set for the worship;and it is said that the least time is ninedays by seven, and the greatest seven"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"years by nine.

But even so it is"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"best to keep the Wand and Cup; and ifone must choose, the Cup.For the Robes, that of aPhilosophus, or that of an AdeptWithin is most suitable; or, the robebest fitted for the service of theparticular Deity, as a bassara forBacchus, a white robe for Vesta. Soalso, for Vesta, one might use forinstrument the Lamp; or the sickle, forChronos.1 0 . Concerning the Incense andLibations. The incense should followthe nature of the particular Deity; as,mastic for Mercury, dittany forPersephone. Also the libations, as, adecoction of nightshade forMelancholia, or of Indian hemp for"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Uranus.11. Concerning the harmony of theceremonies.

And all being carefullyprepared and rehearsed, let it bepractised daily until it be whollyrhythmical with his aspiration, and asit were, a part of his being.12. Concerning the variety of theceremonies. Now, seeing that everyman differeth essentially from everyother man, albeit in essence he is"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"identical, let also these ceremoniesassert their identity by their diversity.For this reason do We leave muchherein to the right Ingenium of thePhilosophus.1 3 . Concerning the life of thedevotee. First, let his way of life besuch as is pleasing to the particularDeity. Thus to invoke Neptune, lethim go a-fishing; but if Hades, let himnot approach the water that is hatefulto Him.14. Further, concerning the life ofthe devotee. Let him cut away fromhis life any act, word, or thought, thatis hateful to the particular Deity; as,unchastity in the case of Artemis,evasions in the case of Ares. Besides"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"this, he should avoid all harshness orunkindness of any kind in thought,word, or deed, seeing that above theparticular Deity is One in whom all isOne. Yet also he may deliberatelypractise cruelties, where the particularDeity manifests His love in thatmanner; as in the case of Kali, and ofPan. And therefore, before thebeginning of his period of devotion,let him practise according to the rulesof Liber Jugorum.15. Further concerning the life ofthe devotee. Now, as many are fullyoccupied with their affairs, let it beknown that this method is adaptable tothe necessities of all.And We bear witness that this"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"which followeth is the Crux andQuintessence of the whole Method.First, if he have no Image, let himtake anything soever, and consecrate itas an Image of his God. Likewise withhis robes and instruments, hissuffumigations and libations: for hisRobe hath he not a night-dress; for hisinstrument a walking-stick; for hissuffumigation a burning match, for hislibation a glass of water?But let him consecrate each thingthat he useth to the service of thatparticular Deity, and not profane thesame to any other use.16.

Third, even if hehave leisure and preparation, let himseek ever to bring inward the symbols,so that even in his well-ordered shrinethe whole ceremony revolve inwardlyin his heart, that is to say in thetemple of his body, of which the outertemple is but an image.For in the brain is the shrine, andthere is no Image therein; and thebreath of man is the incense and thelibation.1 8 . Continuation. Further"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"concerning occupation. Let thedevotee transmute within the alembicof his heart every thought, or word, oract into the spiritual gold of hisdevotion.As thus: eating. Let him say: “I eatthis food in gratitude to my Deity thathath sent it to me, in order to gainstrength for my devotion to Him.”Or: sleeping. Let him say: “I liedown to sleep, giving thanks for thisblessing from my Deity, in order that Imay be refreshed for new devotion toHim.”Or: reading. Let him say: “I readthis book that I may study the natureof my Deity, that further knowledge ofHim may inspire me with deeper"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"devotion to Him.”Or: working. Let him say: “I drivemy spade into the earth that freshflowers (fruit, or what not) may springup to His glory, and that I, purified bytoil, may give better devotion toHim.”Or, whatever it may be that he isdoing, let him reason it out in his ownmind, drawing it throughcircumstance and circumstance to thatone end and conclusion of the matter.And let him not perform the act untilhe hath done this.As it is written: Liber VII. cap. v.—22. “Every breath, everyword, every thought, is anact of love with thee."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"23. “The beat of my heart isthe pendulum of love.24. “The songs of me are thesoft sighs:25. “The thoughts of me arevery rapture:26. “And my deeds are themyriads of Thy children,the stars and the atoms.”And Remember Well, that if thouwert in truth a lover, all this wouldstthou do of thine own nature withoutthe slightest flaw or failure in theminutest part thereof.1 9 . Concerning the Lections. Letthe Philosophus read solely in hiscopies of the holy books of Thelema,during the whole period of his"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"devotion. But if he weary, then let himread books which have no partwhatever in love, as for recreation.But let him copy out each verse ofThelema which bears upon thismatter, and ponder them, andcomment thereupon. For therein is awisdom and a magic too deep to utterin any other wise.2 0 . Concerning the Meditations.Herein is the most potent method ofattaining unto the End, for him who isthoroughly prepared, being purified bythe practice of the Transmutation ofdeed into devotion, and consecratedby the right performance of the holyceremonies. Yet herein is danger, forthat the Mind is fluid as quicksilver,"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"and bordereth upon the Abyss, and isbeset by many sirens and devils thatseduce and attack it to destroy it.Therefore let the devotee beware, andprecise accurately his meditations,even as a man should build a canalfrom sea to sea.2 1 . Continuation. Let then thePhilosophus meditate upon all lovethat hath ever stirred him. There is thelove of David and of Jonathan, and thelove of Abraham and Isaac, and thelove of Lear and Cordelia, and thelove of Damon and Pythias, and thelove of Sappho and Atthis, and thelove of Romeo and Juliet, and the loveof Dante and Beatrice, and the love ofPaolo and Francesca, and the love of"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Caesar and Lucrezia Borgia, and thelove of Aucassin and Nicolette, andthe love of Daphnis and Chloe, and thelove of Cornelia and Caius Gracchus,and the love of Bacchus and Ariadne,and the love of Cupid and Psyche, andthe love of Endymion and Artemis,and the love of Demeter andPersephone, and the love of Venus andAdonis, and the love of Lakshmi andVishnu, and the love of Siva andBhavani, and the love of Buddha andAnanda, and the love of Jesus andJohn, and many more.Also there is the love of manysaints for their particular deity, as ofSt Francis of Assisi for Christ, of SriSabhapaty Swami for Maheswara, of"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Abdullah Haji Shirazi for Allah, of StIgnatius Loyola for Mary, and manymore.Now do thou take one such storyevery night, and enact it in thy mind,grasping each identity with infinitecare and zest, and do thou figurethyself as one of the lovers and thyDeity as the other. Thus do thou passthrough all adventures of love, notomitting one; and to each do thouconclude: How pale a reflection is thisof my love for this Deity!Yet from each shalt thou draw someknowledge of love, some intimacywith love, that shall aid thee to perfectthy love. Thus learn the humility oflove from one, its obedience from"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"another, its intensity from a third, itspurity from a fourth, its peace fromyet a fifth.So then thy love being madeperfect, it shall be worthy of thatperfect love of His.22. Further concerning meditation.Moreover, let the Philosophusimagine to himself that he hath indeedsucceeded in his devotion, and that hisLord hath appeared to him, and thatthey converse as may be fitting.2 3 . Concerning the MysteriousTriangle. Now then as three cordsseparately may be broken by a child,while those same cords duly twistedmay bind a giant, let the Philosophuslearn to entwine these three methods"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"of Magic into a Spell.To this end let him understand thatas they are One, because the end isone, so are they One because themethod is One, even the method ofturning the mind toward the particularDeity by love in every act.And lest thy twine slip, here is alittle cord that wrappeth tightly roundand round all, even the Mantram orContinuous Prayer.2 4 . Concerning the Mantram orContinuotis Prayer. Let thePhilosophus weave the Name of theParticular Deity into a sentence shortand rhythmical; as, for Artemis: , , ; or, for Shiva: NamoShivaya namaha Aum; or, for Mary:"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Ave Maria; or, for Pan, ; or, forAllah: Hua Allahu alazi lailaha illaHua.Let him repeat this day and nightwithout cessation mechanically in hisbrain, which is thus made ready forthe Advent of that Lord, and armedagainst all other.25. Concerning the Active and thePassive.

For such is this Methodof most use; yet let them know thatthere is this danger therein, that theymay mistake the gross body of thesymbol for the idea made concretethereby.3 2 . Considerations of furtherdanger to those not purged of materialthought. Let it be remembered that inthe nature of the love itself is danger.The lust of the satyr for the nymph isindeed of the same nature as theaffinity of Quicklime for water on theone hand, and of the love of Ab forAma on the other; so also is the triadOsiris, Isis, Horus like that of a horse,mare, foal, and of red, blue, purple."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"And this is the foundation ofCorrespondences.But it were false to say “Horus is afoal” or “Horus is purple.” One maysay “Horus resembles a foal in thisrespect, that he is the oft spring of twocomplementary beings.”33.

For itis written of the Perfected One:“There is no member of my bodywhich is not the member of somegod.” Therefore let not thePhilosophus despise any form of love,but harmonise all. As it is written:Liber LXI. 32. “So thereforePerfection abideth not in the Pinnaclesor in the Foundation, but in theharmony of One with all.”"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Second, if any part of this loveexceed, there is disease therein. As, inthe love of Othello for Desdemona,love's jealousy overcame love'stenderness, so may it be in this love ofa particular Deity.

Further concerning the value ofthis Method. Certain objections arise.Firstly, in the nature of all human loveis illusion, and a certain blindness.Nor is there any true love below theVeil of the Abyss. For this reason Wegive this Method to the Philosophus,as the reflection of the Exempt Adept,who reflects the Magister Templi andthe Magus.

This isequally a defect characteristic of theGrade.43. Concerning a notable danger ofSuccess. It may occur that owing tothe tremendous power of the Samadhi,overcoming all other memories as itshould and does do, that the mind ofthe devotee may be obsessed, so thathe declare his particular Deity to besole God and Lord. This error hasbeen the foundation of all dogmaticreligions, and so the cause of moremisery than all other errors combined.The Philosophus is peculiarly liableto this because from the nature of theMethod he cannot remain sceptical; he"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"must for the time believe in hisparticular Deity.
