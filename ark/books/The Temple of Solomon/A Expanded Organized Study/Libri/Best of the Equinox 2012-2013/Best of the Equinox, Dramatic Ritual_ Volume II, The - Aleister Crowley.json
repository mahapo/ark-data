We seeelements of prehistoric dramatic ritualpainted on the walls of caves andscratched upon the bones of extinctanimals. The tragedies and comediesof the ancient Greeks were written tobe entertaining and thought provokingbut first and foremost they werereligious observances (celebrated inthe temple of Dionysus).

Laughter, tears, and terror"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"are literally evoked into us by themagick of the play or film.The magical potential of drama wasnot lost on our ancestors. Knowingthat only relatively few individuals ofevery generation are emotionally andintellectually equipped to master thenatural and spiritual sciences, thehierophants of the past discovered thatit was yet possible to bring asignificant level of enlightenment tothe masses. It was very important, forinstance, for the working populationof ancient agrarian cultures to knowthe best times to plant and cultivatetheir crops. However, for most of thelabor force it really wasn't important(or even helpful) to understand the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"chain of astronomical events thataffect the change of seasons.It was far easier (and on one levelmore truthful) to personify the forcesand facts of nature as gods, and thenmake those gods characters in asimple and unforgettable story orplay. In the case of an agriculturaldrama the story might simply beintended to reveal the lesson that it isbest to plant in the early spring ratherthan in the autumn.A greater spiritual potential ofdramatic ritual lies in the fact that asindividuals each of us can actuallybecome the main character in thesacred drama. This is the method ofinitiation practiced by mystery"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"schools of the past and initiatorysocieties of today. The ancientmystery schools were not so muchschools of instruction, rather theywere schools of experiences—dramatic experiences skillfullydesigned to induce profound changesin consciousness to a large number ofindividuals.Tradition informs us that thetechnique of the mystery schoolsachieved its highest level ofperfection in Greece. From ca. 2000BC to nearly three hundred years intothe Christian era the agriculturalmysteries of Demeter and Persephonewere celebrated within the walledcitadel at Eleusis. So strict were the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"oaths of secrecy imposed uponinitiates that we are still not entirelycertain what went on at theceremonies3 themselves. We knowfrom indirect sources that once theinitiatory cycles began with apurifying bath in the sea at Athensfollowed by a ceremonial march fromAthens to Eleusis. The secretactivities took place over a span ofdays and included sacred food anddrink, music, dance, plays andvignettes.Most of the events were performedbefore a large assembly of theparticipants. The climacticconclusion, however, was conferredprivately, one candidate at a time."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Modern scholars point to evidencethat prior to this sublime moment thecandidate most probably was given apsychedelic substance to eat or drink.Whatever their technique, thehierophants of Eleusis succeeded forover two thousand years in affectingprofound changes in the consciousnessof countless thousands of individuals—individuals who after theirinitiatory experience proclaimed withthe greatest conviction that theywould never fear death again."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Rite of ArtemisOne might think that the awe-inspiring ceremonies that took placein the cavernous Temple of Demeterat Eleusis would have little incommon with the genteel after-dinnerparlor diversions of EdwardianLondon, but that is precisely the venuewhere the idea for Crowley's Rites ofEleusis was conceived.On a chilly evening in the spring of1910 E.V., to entertain their host (orperhaps merely to sing for theirsupper), Crowley and hislover/disciple Miss Leila Waddellengaged in curious battle that pittedpoetry against music. First, Crowley"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"recited a poem he felt would puteveryone in an exalted frame of mind.Then he challenged Waddell, aconsummate violin virtuoso, tocomplement and magnify the moodwith a piece of music.The exchanges soon became wildlyintense and rapturous. After only afew volleys everyone in the roomfound themselves raised to a tangiblelevel of ecstasy. Before the bliss ofthe moment subsided Crowleyrealized he had discovered the basicformula of the Eleusinian technique.Moreover, he now had a vehicle tointroduce Scientific Illumination andthe Magick of Thelema to a wideraudience. He immediately set to work"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"to create an ecstasy-inducing dramaticritual that he would stage publicly.The Rite of Artemis4 was presentedfor the public and members of thepress on the evening of August 23,1910 E.V. at the office of The Equinoxin London. The element of dance wasadded to the combination of poetryand music in the person of VictorNeuburg who, aside from being one ofthe greatest poets of his generation,possessed the thrilling ability to dancewith bacchanalic abandon until hecollapsed unconscious upon the floor.It was very impressive.Another addition to the artistic mixwas the introduction of the Cup ofLibation that was offered to the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"audience several times during theceremony to better facilitate the rushof ecstasy. The content of the cup wasmost likely a potent mixture of herbs,alcohol, fruit-juice, and mescalbuttons (at the time perfectly legal).Predictably, everyone felt the ecstasy.The reaction was remarkablypositive.

Starting at the top,the third Sephirah, Binah, is thesphere of Saturn and the highestplanetary sphere.
