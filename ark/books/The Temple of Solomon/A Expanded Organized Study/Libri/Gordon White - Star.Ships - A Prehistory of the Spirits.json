Winding like a cosmicserpent down from the New Guinea highlands, it has the fifth largest annual flow on theplanet. Lacking a delta for her mouth, she stains the ocean brown for miles. Such isher volume, it is said that the local boatmen can draw fresh water straight from thesea. People have been living and dying on her banks for more than 40,000 years. Shehas welcomed and bid depart to whole cultures. She is untroubled by Ice Ages. Myaunt was born on the banks of the Sepik and my grandfather once ran the province sonamed for it.It is a place of curious survivals, of forgotten things. Up in the highlands, claimsof seeing living examples of Homo floresiensis – the famous ‘Indonesian hobbit’believed to have died out ten millennia ago – persist into modern times. The day myaunt was born, four Japanese soldiers, who had been hiding among the natives ofDutch New Guinea for the ten years since the war, arrived in the province capital ofWewak. They boarded a ship, the Taisei Maru, which had come to collect the remainsof the war dead and return them to Japan. My grandmother covered the story for theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation and then went into labour that night.Stories are perhaps the most curious of survivals. They can fall in and out ofremembrance. Who is telling them often matters more than how they are stored. Forprobably tens of millennia it was the shamans and sorcerers who kept the stories ofthe tribes, who held the mirror of identity and meaning up to their people. Like so muchin the West, this function has been outsourced from us with predictably disastrouslocal consequences. In the mid-twentieth century, academia became aware that ourunderstanding of knowledge is always situational and always contingent on culturalinstitutions that create that knowledge. But by then it was too late. Our stories hadpassed from us. This was too much power to hand over. It was a bad deal.10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Any given field makes ‘truth statements’ that form a network of relationshipswith themselves, governed by a worldview that establishes what is or is notknowledge within that field. Stories that fall outside this network first become untrue,and then they fade completely from reality. In the early years of the twenty first century,the empowered, informed shaman is presented with the opportunity to rescue thesefading stories from the spirit world and restore them to the tribe. As with all journeysto the spirit world, dangers abound for the unprepared. Discretion, parsimony andevidence-based reasoning, now that they exist in the wider culture, belong here asmuch as they do in the hard sciences. These are the fetishes we must carry to extracttruthful stories from the spirits.Although not my own, one more Sepik story is illustrative of the prey we seekand the nature of its habitat. In his classic Eden in the East, Dr Oppenheimer, while onmedical patrol in the early 1980s, was treating an American woman who was living,along with her husband, among a tribe that had only been ‘first discovered’ theprevious year. These Americans were missionaries of a new kind. Instead of teachingEnglish to the tribe so that they may read the Bible, the Americans were there to learnthe local language so that they could return to the Midwest and have an indigenousBible printed. It occurred to Dr Oppenheimer that once these missionaries had left, thetribe would be filled with foreign stories and legends – of Moses and the flight fromEgypt, of Noah, of Jesus – with no archaeological or genetic evidence indicating howthese tales arrived in the first place. They would just be there, a memory of an imprint.Israelites standing uncomfortably under a banana tree spirit, warily eyeing theancestral death masks, like confused foreign guests at a wedding reception. The Sepikkeeps these ghosts, and many similar, older ones besides.Stories, then, can move in a way pottery or malarial adaptations cannot. Allarchaeological evidence of contact is accompanied by cultural evidence, but not allcultural evidence of contact is accompanied by archaeological evidence. Stories canecho and refract through and beside the scientific story of mankind. They are specialartefacts that cry out for a unique method of analysis. They are challenging prey tohunt.After a childhood of wide-ranging Pacific travel, it was studying documentaryfilm-making and cross-cultural studies that first opened up whole new vistas ofcomparative mythology for me. While still a student, I bought a very expensivecamera to take SCUBA diving for sunken cities in Micronesia. This adventure is myown personal BC/AD pivot point. Nothing would be quite the same afterward.Built from millions of tonnes of prismatic basalt and stretching over eleven11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"square miles of mangrove swamp, the necropolis of Nan Madol is the most enigmaticsite in the entire Pacific. One of the great joys of my life was canoeing along its canals,exploring its tombs and platforms, and diving in the murky, shark-infested waterbeside it, looking for evidence of earlier occupation.The place is so completely out of context with everything else around it forhundreds of miles that Nan Madol feels like it should be a truly archaic survival, arelic of a long-vanished race. It isn’t. Almost the only thing we know with anyconfidence about Nan Madol is when construction began on the current site, aroundthe twelfth century. There are older buildings in London!How Nan Madol was built, why it was built, where the millions of tonnes ofbasalt came from, the reason for choosing its location ... these are examples ofadvanced cultural technology that have moved through time without correspondingarchaeological evidence. When it was built is almost the least significant part of itsstory. The irreconcilability of Nan Madol’s mythology and its physical presence hasstayed with me since that expedition.Such an extreme disconnect between the physical and non-physical evidence isfamiliar territory for magicians. In the performance of it, magic feels supremelyancient. Even its most modern iterations feel like they were old when the world wasnew. Intellectually we know this is not the case, but we also know somehow that itprobably is.FURTHER RIVER SPIRITSThis book was not written on the banks of the Sepik, though she does feature inits tale. It was written on the banks of the Thames, the Tiber, the Hudson and theSeine, but the story is always the same because river spirits are always the same:How long have we been here? Who came before? Where did they go? Who or whatanswered their night prayers, and at what cost? Civilisation is the tobacco of riverspirits. They seem to crave it, to will it into being up and down their banks, eventhough the relationship appears damaging over the long term.As to why it is a creature as ahistorical as a chaos magician finds himselfchasing down geneticists, historians and astronomers, pursuing Very Old Things, thecompulsion is, inevitably, best explained with a story about stories:In a story told about Aristotle in Europe, and about an Indian philosopher in India,the philosopher meets a village carpenter who has a beautiful old knife and askshim, ‘How long have you had this knife?’ The carpenter answers, ‘Oh, the knife12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"has been in our family for generations. We have changed the handle a few timesand the blade a few times, but it is the same knife.’The secret of the knife may well be the secret to magic’s supremely ancient‘mouth feel.’ There is a recursion of motifs, of consciousness experiences, of livedrealities that hides western magic’s true antiquity.To examine stories is always perilous. Similarity is self-evident on the firstpass, absent on the second, and both on the final pass. As Patrick Harpur points out,we cannot ‘explain’ or ‘decode’ a myth. To look for the historic or scientific ‘truth’ of amyth is but to retell the myth, albeit in a less satisfying way. We render untomaterialism the control of our most precious mythologies if we allow them to be‘scientifically explained’ to us. A new language is required. New words.Wendy Doniger, one of America’s most celebrated Indologists and culturaltheorists, famously gave a lecture in the 1990s called ‘Microscopes and Telescopes,’in which she defended the use of comparison in mythology from the scorched earthassault of late postmodernism. Myths can be examined through a metaphoricmicroscope, which reveal the thousands of glittering, unique manifestations of aparticular story in a particular culture, or they can be examined through a telescope,where the personalities, codes of dress and foodstuffs fade from view, to be replacedby a wider vision of unifying themes across humanity.One optic device does not invalidate the other, both have their place in analysisand both of them carry the same, often-unacknowledged interpretive risk; the eyeitself.We are always in danger of drawing our own eye, for we depict our own visionof the world when we think we are depicting the world; often when we think weare studying an other we are really studying ourselves through the narrative ofthe other. Our choice of lens level is arbitrary, but not entirely so, for it iscircumscribed by certain boundaries that we ignore to our peril. The choice isheuristic: we choose a specific level in order to make possible a specific task.Where we focus depends on the sorts of continuities we are looking for; in allinstances, something is lost and something is gained.In the study of history or mythology, the twin technologies of the microscope andthe telescope are available to all but it is only rarely that the eye belongs to anyoneoutside our materialist monoculture, rarer still that it belongs to the magician. Thatneeds to change.13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Giordano Bruno, my unofficial patron saint, wrestled with these familiarimbalances between lived personal experience and available physical evidence in thisvery town. Precisely what Bruno was doing in Oxford in 1583 is a matter of endlessacademic discussion. But it clear he was preaching and debating his own hermeticinfinitism. Having stepped beyond Ficino’s Catholic veneer and returned to a fullypagan hermetic system, he believed his use of Egyptian symbols, talimans andvisualisation had uncovered humanity’s ‘source religion’ and our clearest insight intothe nature of reality. What he found in the Hermetica was a fervent belief in mankind’sstellar origins and immortal destiny among innumerable worlds. The knife Bruno heldin his hand was Graeco-Egyptian, but he knew it was older than that.Published the following year, Bruno’s The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beastdemonstrates that familiar, ancient aroma the practice of magic gives off: Hermeticmagic feels old, and the oldest thing he knew was Ancient Egypt, so it must haveoriginated there.A similar logical error is the politest way of explaining, four centuries later,Kenneth Grant’s largely-unsuccessful attempts to shoehorn all of Thelema and theCthulhu Mythos into Sumeria. He was also looking to match the feeling to the data. Bythe mid-twentieth century, Sumeria was the oldest ‘civilised’ culture we knew of.Today it is not.Non-Random MythologiesToday, not only have the origins of civilisation changed beyond all recognition,but even the very word has begun to dissolve under a less Eurocentric analysis.Developments in geology, genetics, astronomy, archaeology and linguistics strain tobreaking the underlying premises and assumptions of scientific materialism.The western esoteric tradition has the opportunity to (finally) do away with theHigh Victorian assumptions that constitute our understanding of the origins of magicalculture and rebuild atop some much better data. The picture that emerges in doing sois stunning in its implications.This is not history. This is not archaeology. This is not folklore. This is a newskill. But it is also an old one. It is not the skill of organising data points into asequential historical narrative. It is the skill of context.

Listen closely.When seeking to explain the similarities between different cosmologies spreadright across the globe, a materialist – ignoring the inherent hypocrisy in his or herposition – will attribute this to similarities in the human mind or brain. Brains are thesame everywhere, so beliefs are the same everywhere. We are somehow ‘wired’ toworship the sun or associate Venus with love. It’s part of how ‘primitive’ humansmake sense of the world.If that were true – and it might be true in some cases – then the distribution ofthese similar beliefs, by definition, must be random, just as variations in eyesight orspatial awareness skills are randomly distributed. You would be surprised just howfew beliefs are randomly or universally distributed.If a belief is non-randomly distributed across cultures then some othermechanism of action is in play. Colonial expeditions, wars, trading partnerships, thecollective unconscious. We may not be able to detect these mechanisms, just as youwould not be able to detect traces of the American missionaries once they had left, buttheir presence nevertheless non-randomly distributed a Midwestern Christiannarrative.What happens then, when we look at the distribution of some of the core beliefsof the western esoteric tradition? Adopting the consensus that what we broadly knowof today as magic coalesced into its recognisable form in the first and secondcenturies in Alexandria and the Eastern Mediterranean, what happens when we usethat as our end point and look at the distribution of its foundational principlesbackwards in time, calibrating them in the light of recent historical and scientific data?We find a very old story, newly re-emerged. A story that says something veryprofound about mankind and our companion spirits.15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IA new scientific discovery does not triumph by convincingits opponents and making them see the light, but ratherbecause its opponents eventually die, and a newgeneration grows up that is familiar with it.Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other PapersONE FUNERAL AT ATIMEScientific enquiry’s cherished claims of impartial, objective truth have certainlyseen better days. After more than two decades helming the august New EnglandJournal of Medicine, outgoing editor-in-chief, Dr Marcia Angell, said in the January2009 New York Review of Books that ‘it is simply no longer possible to believe muchof the clinical research that is published.’ Science is now so riddled with corporateself-interest and falsified experiment data that Nature reported that retractions haveincreased tenfold in the last decade, the tip of the iceberg. The replicability of even thesimplest of experimental results is at an all-time low and getting lower. Casting asidethe enormous ontological implications of this we are nevertheless told, as we havebeen for more than a century, that the edges of the map are being filled in.Corporeal power has always been the ice-cold hand inside science’s latexglove, waiting for you at the airport customs desk. It has never been the objective,absolutely true descriptor of reality that science journalists and other people withseverely limited understandings of science claim it to be. Like all metanarratives ofpower, it is an unreliable narrator of incomplete utility.In an act curiously resonant of initiation into the Classical mystery traditions, itis in acknowledging science’s inherent unreliability, its limitations, that we restore itstrue utility. This is nowhere more necessary than in history and the story of mankind.DANGEROUS ROADSThe historical is supremely political, supremely personal.

It was an imperial battle when Europe’sempires spanned the globe, but only because that is how Power was organised in theera of mercantile expansion. Today, historical narratives – justification narratives –emerge from more modern sources of power. It is the same story, told by differentstorytellers. History may well be written by the victors, but victors change and if wedo not unwrite history then the propaganda from the previous regime still stands.Despite the weight of evidence supporting an origin for rice cultivation in Taiwanand Island Southeast Asia before its subsequent onshoring onto the mainland, there isfierce resistance to these observable facts inside China. It is politically and raciallyrepugnant that such an important innovation emerged first among those funny-facedisland savages. And so it is largely ignored.Israel’s well-funded archaeological programme expands in lock-step with thegrowth of her illegal settlements, providing subtextual legitimacy for the Likud party’saim of restoring her biblical borders. Take a closer look behind the confidentarchaeological headlines, however, and you often find evidence ranging from thetenuous to the spurious.The subcontinent provides the most tragically complete examples of theinextricability of power and history. In seeking to restore Dravidian and early Tamilculture to its true scope and antiquity, it has become a lightning rod for separatistpoliticians. Partition had the effect of placing most of the important Harappan and Indussites inside a new country with a cultural and political regime that exhibitsconsiderable hostility to non-Muslim historical narratives, meaning both academicaccess to and even basic upkeep of probably the most important sites of earlyurbanisation on the planet have been woefully neglected.As for India herself, we have the ‘here again, gone again’ story of the Aryaninvasion. Based on the complete misidentification of a few skeletons in the upperlayers of Mohenjo Daro and a European refusal to believe that a people so browncould have given the world the Rig Veda, a fictitious invasion of lighter-skinned,charioteering ‘Aryans’ around 1500 BCE was declared the source of Vedic culture. Inthe twentieth century, they were described as a hardy race who, like all goodprimitives, deified natural phenomena and called upon their aid in battles; the Vedaswere their battle hymns. Because the ‘Aryan invasion’ theory is not only racist butcompletely wrong, it has been quietly abandoned by the majority of scholars.However, this has left Indologists with what we might call the Jenga Paradox: the17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"foundational bricks of the theory have been removed, but no one wants to admit suchactions bring down the entire tower. It is how we can end up with straight-facedanalyses such as this one, from Ariel Glucklich, theology professor at Georgetown,writing in The Strides of Vishnu as late as 2008:The subjects of the Indo-Aryan controversy were energetic and rambunctiouspeople who probably arrived gradually from central and western Asia. Theyhave been called Aryans (from arya, ‘hospitable one’), but this should not betaken as an ethnic term. ‘Indo-Aryan’ is the somewhat more precise linguisticcategory that most scholars today prefer to use. As noted, the majority ofscholars today, largely on the basis of linguistic evidence (for example, theabsence of South Asian linguistic characteristics such as retroflection west ofIndia), do support the migration hypothesis. The arrival of the Indo-Aryansprobably took several centuries and was mostly peaceful, and evidenceindicates that a genuine cultural exchange took place as they encounteredindigenous populations, including the late phases of the Harappa culture. Fewarchaeological remains attest to the material culture of the mobile population orto the events of those centuries ... Virtually everything we know about theseextraordinary people derives from their prolific literary output – primarily theRig Veda.To recap, there are no historical remains for this large-scale migration and theonly evidence to support it comes from the documents created by this evidence-freeculture. You can see the circular logic. Further problematising the lack ofarchaeological evidence is the growing genetic evidence of internal cultural continuitybetween the Harappan and later cultures, and the singular lack of genetic evidence fora large-scale migration of a people from who-knows-where between 1750 BCE and850 BCE.As for any attempts to trace stories into or out of India (or anywhere else, for thatmatter), the Platonic form of nationalism is always there. Returning to Dr Doniger:Tale-tracking has political implications. Tellers tend to regard their own cultureas the source and other cultures as the borrowers and to deny that theythemselves have borrowed from other cultures, for reasons of status andhierarchy: to be upstream, to be the giver rather than the receiver, is to besuperior. (Recall the old Soviet claims that Russians invented the telephone,etc.) Outside the culture, British (and German) scholars may well have beeninspired to trace stories back to India (and China: the colonies), in part as anoutgrowth of the nineteenth-century craze for origins (the source of the Nile, the18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"source of Language [itself an old search, as in Herodotus’s experiment with theinfant who said ‘bread’ in Phrygian]) but also as a way of feminizing thesecultures, as David Henry Hwang reminded us in M. Butterfly: ‘The East isfeminine – weak, delicate, poor ... but good at art and full of inscrutable wisdom– the feminine mystique.’ They tell good stories, but they need us to run theircountry. This was also a way of privileging the past of India over its present, asSanskrit and the ancient Vedas were valued over vernacular languages andcontemporary, ‘idolatrous,’ Hinduism: the thinking becomes, they used to tellgreat stories, but they need us now to run their country.The Indus question will be explored in considerable detail in later chapters. Fornow, it is important to be aware that into the post-imperial academic power vacuumcreated by the end of the Aryan Invasion Theory have poured great volumes of Indiannationalist sentiment, unbalancing the quest for historical authenticity in the oppositedirection. And so we must navigate between ‘the Vedas originated within the samecultural groups that gave us Harappa and the Indus cities’ (probably more right thanwrong) and ‘India invented and exported everything’ (definitely more wrong than right).These are dangerous roads, then. Dangerous as the people who travel themprofessionally.THE BUDDHAS’ REVENGEFollowing the Taliban’s appalling destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues in2001, the editors of the prominent archaeology journal Antiquity did something veryrare in academic publishing. They called out other forms of archaeologicaliconoclasm. They drew attention to a disordered house. They named names. Theypointed fingers.The editorial begins by shaming the non-publication of fieldwork results – at thetime more than 80% of Italian fieldwork remained unpublished and much of the twodecades of findings from the American team at Abydos still remain unpublished.Regarding the latter, I have my suspicions as to why, which we will come to in a laterchapter.It also highlights a refusal to allow other researchers access to sites or archivedmaterial, for fear that others will publish first. Mycenaean tomb excavation reports thatsat unpublished for fifty years prevented half a century of additional research that couldhave been undertaken. And when other researchers are actually allowed access,supervisors often usurp the ideas of their junior team member. Then there is the‘ferocious and bullying reactions to the slightest criticism, aimed especially at19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"intimidating young colleagues.’The final and most alarming finger-pointing goes to an even more seriousproblem. Outright fraud. There is the case of the Italian superintendent who tookMycenaean pottery sherds out of a museum store, then re-buried them in Tuscany sohe could dig them back up again. Or the deputy director of the Tohoku PalaeolithicInstitute in Japan, Shinichi Fujimura, who was videotaped burying artefacts to‘discover’ again. At the time, Fujimura had the nickname, ‘God’s Hands,’ for hisamazing ability to unearth rare and significant artefacts. He admitted to placing 61 ofthe 65 pieces he had discovered, as well as all 29 of the pieces he had discovered theprevious year. God’s hands, indeed.In the late nineties, Dr Anton Misfud reported that a cave painting of a bison bullon the wall of Malta’s Hypogeum was ‘removed at the express directive of the directorof museums.’ The bison bull is, of course, an ice age inhabitant of Malta and itspresence on the walls of the Hypogeum pushes its date of construction back from theNeolithic into the Palaeolithic. As would the cave paintings discovered under somefifteen thousand year old stalagmites in Ghar Hasan on Malta’s south coast. Thesewere also mysteriously destroyed and the cave was covered with a locked, metal gate‘to protect a colony of bats.’Malta has some of the Mediterranean’s most astounding examples of earlyhuman culture and, as a result, has more than a century of highly dubious academicbehaviour; misrepresenting chemical dating, swapping out older remains for youngerones and so on. In 1910, Sir Temi Zammit excavated the partial remains of more than6000 people in the Hypogeum. By 1971, J. D. Evans, future Director of the Institute ofArchaeology, lamented the loss of all but eleven skulls from the excavation. WhenGraham Hancock visited in 2001, there were only six left.When Michael Cremo visited Ukraine’s Dnepropetrovsk Historical Museum,the head of the archaeology collection, Dr Larisa Churilova, showed him artefacts thatindicated an early Stone Age belief in reincarnation. Her reason for not publishing herfindings was that the editors of journals are uncomfortable with cultural interpretations.They just want to print things like ‘a stone flake two centimetres long was found at adepth of one metre in the excavation.’If only it were so that editors found discomfort in cultural interpretations! Thetrue source of discomfort arises from interpretations that step out of academia’sspecific cultural lens.

It is theunspoken belief that humanity is on a journey from worse to better, from primitive tocomplex, uncivilised to civilised. Our civilisation of perpetual war, total surveillance,obesity, runaway mental illness, overmedication, environmental degradation,widespread unemployment and scientific materialism has nothing to learn from thepast because it is better. Enjoy that smartphone made by suicidal Taiwanese slavelabour. Continue shopping.Ancient history has become the wartime propaganda for Darwinian scientism.Data that contradict Power’s latest belief system are suppressed, destroyed, attackedor ignored.Even if contemporary historians pay lip service to the notion that this is nolonger always the case, in most instances this means they are simply unaware oftheir own scientism. Any attempts to consider our Palaeolithic ancestors as moreadvanced than previously thought still carries the patronising tone of a completestranger complimenting the artwork of a handicapped child. ‘Look at how clever ourinferiors were,’ we say, as we die, fat and unhappy, waving our iPhones around forsignal.The magnet is still in effect, at least in terms of popular discourse. Nobody hasrearranged the iron filings into a more accurate map.ARTIFICIAL HORIZONSYou may not know it, but your understanding of ancient history probably owesalmost everything to one man, V. Gordon Childe. He is the man who, in the mid-twentieth century, gave us the three distinct phases of preindustrial society we allcarry around in our heads. These are savagery, then barbarism, then civilisation.Entirely artificial horizons were drawn based on what Childe considered to bethe hallmarks of advancement from one stage to the next and then every single culturethat is or ever was got dropped into them. V. Gordon Childe gave us the magnet.Savages have very unpleasant and dangerous lives, foraging and killingexclusively wild foods. Today we use the more polite term, hunter-gatherer, but thesubtextual unpleasantness – the sense that these are lesser cultures leading largely21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"miserable lives – remains.Savages progressed to the higher state of barbarism during a period Childenamed the Neolithic Revolution. Barbarians domesticate animals and beginagriculture. This surplus of food allows for barbarian cultures to become morecomplex and diversify. Priests emerge; villages are created; megalithic sites areconstructed; people own things. As for civilisation? That only happens with the birth ofthe city. Because it can get difficult to demarcate when a large town becomes a city, itis best if urbanisation occurs in conjunction with writing. Without writing, a culture isprobably ‘high barbarian’ at best. Sorry Incas.It is because of Childe that we unthinkingly consider the Sumerians to be thefirst civilisation on earth, with Egypt and the Indus cultures getting the joint silvermedal. At the time of the publication of Childe’s seminal ‘The Urban Revolution’ in1950, Sumeria was the oldest known culture to have both cities and writing.These, then, are our artificial horizons. Fall outside them and you are in dangerof being erased at the ‘express directive of the director of museums.’ Anthropologyprofessor Michael E. Smith writes in 2009 that scholars today rarely cite Childeanymore, or even acknowledge his influence on their models. ‘Nevertheless, thearchaeological study of ancient complex societies is still dominated by the themes ofurbanism, agricultural intensification and surplus, craft specialisation, socialinequality, and the nature of power and state, each of which was first applied toarchaeological data in a systematic fashion by V. Gordon Childe.’The secondary impact of Childe’s artificial horizons is more noticeable tomagicians than it is to fraudulent Japanese archaeologists, and is just as dangerous asthe primary one. Childe’s was the first ‘explanation’ of progress that allowed culturalexpression to be described in exclusively material terms. Stone circles were notconstructed because of ecstatic communion with the gods, temples were not physicalexpressions of a profound devotional mythology. No. The inner motivations foroutward cultural expression became entirely irrelevant, entirely redundant. Grain wasstored, women were pregnant ... time to build a temple.In the 1960s, functional explanations for urban development were popular. Thisheld that as cultures became larger and more complex, leaders altruistically steppedforward to take on the task of organisation for the good of the group. It may be nosurprise to see this mirrors the postwar expansion of the state and its buildingprogrammes; mass immunisation, free education, infrastructure investment and soon. By the 1980s, a more ‘political’ interpretation reigned. Here it was the whims of theself-serving elite which triggered the building projects of early states. Again, we can22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"see Childe’s functional explanation refracted through the worldview of the time:Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Gekko as rulers of trickle-down urbanisation. Morerecently, explanations rely on ‘human-environmental’ interactions, which is why youcannot move for graduating theses that suggest ‘ancient climate change’ wasresponsible for absolutely any cultural development or change that shows upanywhere in the archaeological record.It is this ideological underpinning that Michael E. Smith is alluding to when hewrites about V. Gordon Childe’s invisible impact on anthropology. We now consider it‘scientific’ or ‘professional’ to describe cultural artefacts – non-physical objects – inexclusively materialist terms. Only a functional analysis of the mythological processis allowed, which is like describing your grandmother’s famous chicken soup solelyby its molecular constituency.According to Curtis White, Professor Emeritus of English at Illinois State,leaving these assumptions unexamined is dangerous. In the Spring 2014 issue ofTricycle: The Buddhist Review, Linda Heuman wrote in her article, ‘The ScienceDelusion’:In White’s view, once scientism rewrites our story so that the things humanbeings care about – like love, wonder, presence, or play – are reduced to atoms,genes, or neurons, human lives become easy prey to corporate and politicalinterests. We become ‘mere functions within systems.’ White wants us to wakeup and recognize that this view is not scientific discovery, it is ideology.Mistaking one for the other has profound consequences, ‘not just for knowledgebut even more importantly for how we live.’Cultural evolutionism suggests that man moves up to naturally higher stages ofdevelopment. Some societies could thus be considered superior to others based ontechnological complexity. From an historical research perspective, it also means thatthe further back you go in time, then by definition, the less complex human culturebecomes. Otherwise something was awry with Darwin’s theories. Anthropology’stimeline became fixed, unidirectional. Reducing the story of humanity to mechanics,the story of a human to brain reactions, is not science. It is ideology, the wolf dressedas the sheep.Whilst it always had a home on the mental landscape of the magician, the notionthat progress and civilisation are not the same thing has wider appeal today than atany time in the recent past. It is our sacred duty to lean forward into this change, toensure it has every chance of success.

The Lascaux cave paintings arethe tiniest tip of the largest iceberg, the scant physical extension of a non-physicalrealm so huge it dwarfs the sun. A materialist researcher can but stand beforeLascaux’s open cosmic doorway and announce ‘we have no way of knowing what isbehind it.’ Speak for yourself, mate.Subsequent to the invention of Childe’s artificial horizons, it emerged that thedevelopment of grain-based agriculture was an unmitigated disaster for human healthand longevity. What Childe saw as an evolution is a devolution. Measuring the marchof civilisation from this point, we see a succession of politico-economic systems thatpurported to improve human existence – culminating in today’s modern, materialistage – that have most often had the complete opposite effect. Rather than getting evercloser, we have moved further away from genuine sources of meaning and purpose.Instead of measuring a civilisation by its density of sprockets, what happenswhen we consider civilisation to be a collection of values, thoughts, mythologies?What happens when we count up the non-physical sprockets? The human journeyceases to look like a collection of trailers before the beginning of The Internet: TheMovie and starts to wobble. We have been more civilised, we have been lesscivilised. Humanity looks like a toddler learning to walk, sometimes taking steps,sometimes falling down.‘HOLY LAND’ SYNDROMEDiscoverer of Göbekli Tepe and its chief excavator, Dr Klaus Schmidt, famouslywarned against what he called ‘Holy Land Syndrome,’ which is the propensity forarchaeologists to head out into the field with a spade in one hand and a Bible in theother. Holy Land Syndrome precludes the finding of something you didn’t alreadyexpect to find.This is a problem stretching back centuries. Archaeology, emerging out ofantiquarianism, itself emerging out of Grand Tour dilettantism, unfortunately predatesgeology and genetics. The belief that the stories told in the Bible are in some or anysense accurate forms the baseline mythology of the field. In the words of Robert AntonWilson, ‘what the thinker thinks, the prover proves.’Our understanding of how global cultures formed and are expressed has yet tobe rebalanced. We have the implicit assumption that all major technologies have theirorigin in the Fertile Crescent, which was the first and only place we looked for them.Even now, any suggestion that the observed cultural technology we associate with24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"civilisation emerged anywhere outside this area is automatically on the back foot.The twenty first century offers us a new Holy Land Syndrome. There is still thespade in one hand, but the Bible has been replaced with a very selective reading of Onthe Origin of Species. Science does not consider itself an ideology, as it claims to onlydeal with what is real. This is, of course, what every ideology thinks of itself. Thecomplete hijacking of all non-physical criteria of being human in favour of theunfounded belief that we are meat robots, lacking in free will, has enormousimplications for what it is the archaeologist actually finds. As she thinks, so sheproves.Right across the academic spectrum, the growth of STEM subjects (ScienceTechnology Engineering Mathematics) has the unfortunate impact of closing down allways of understanding or approaching truth that cannot be ultimately reduced toscientism’s belief that only the material exists.When it comes to the history of non-physical subjects like mythology and belief,this is putting the inmates in charge of the asylum. As Dr Naydler writes, ‘inadvocating that we explain religious phenomena in the nonreligious terms of the socialsciences or linguistic anthropology, what is specifically religious is lost to view.’Attempting to view the mythic ‘objectively’ instantly destroys the subject one wishes tounderstand in the first place. However, attempting to view a mythic subject non-objectively in the academic arena is a recipe for career suicide. And so the academictreatment of the spiritual component of human life reduces the subject entirely tosocial and cultural conditions. Most academics end up where Mircea Eliade said theywould:If these consequences are not always evident, it is because the majority ofhistorians of religion defend themselves against the messages with which theirdocuments are filled. This caution is understandable. One does not live withimpunity in intimacy with ‘foreign’ religious forms, which are sometimesextravagant and often terrible. But many historians end up by no longer takingseriously the spiritual worlds they study; they fall back on their personalreligious faith, or they take refuge in a materialism or behaviorism imperviousto every spiritual shock. Besides, excessive specialization allows a greaternumber of historians of religion to station themselves for the rest of their days inthe sectors they have learned to frequent since their youth. And every‘specialization’ ends by making the religious forms banal; in the last instance iteffaces their meaning.Alexandre Afonso, a political economy lecturer at King’s College London, points25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"out that academia is almost identical to how drug cartels are economically organised;with an expanding mass of outsiders and a shrinking core of insiders. Junioracademics are prepared to forgo decent wages, job security and quality of life for thedecreasingly likely chance of ending up in one of the few remaining tenured, top jobs.With university budgets under pressure and the huge growth in PhDs, theeconomics of academia compounds a lot of the problems already inherent in its faintlyludicrous medieval structure. The man or woman at the top gets to have all the ideas,and your growth through the ranks is largely dependent on his opinion of you, whichmakes challenging his ideas increasingly risky. The result is a narrowing ofperspectives down to as few as possible and the flight to research areas that have littlerisk of upending the prevailing paradigm. Consider this view from Eleanor Parker, ajunior Oxford academic in Anglo-Saxon, and writer of the excellent blog, A Clerk ofOxford.[A]cademia is not always a happy place to work. I’m a very junior academic,and to people in my position a career in academia offers a daunting future: a lifeof short-term contracts and little security, with very limited ability to plan ahead.You can probably imagine the psychological effects of this, and the impact it canhave on one’s confidence and sense of self-worth ... Most of my friends are alsoearly career academics, in a similar position, and when I look at them I seetalented young people consumed with anxiety and fear about the future,constantly doubting their value as scholars, and consequently as human beings.[..]The precarious nature of academic jobs is an endemic problem, perhapsnot something individuals can do much about, but academics often don’t helpthis pervading mood of anxiety by just not being very nice to each other ... Partof the fear of failure is feeling almost desperately dependent on the goodwill ofmore powerful people, without any control over the fate of your own work;reviewers and academic publishers, for instance, have a huge amount of powerover my future, and I have no influence on them whatsoever. I have to get mywork published if I ever want to get another job, so they’re free to treat mehowever they want and I have to do as they ask, lest they decide to say ‘actually,we won’t publish this after all.’ That’s a frightening situation to be in.This is how you end up with a field that buries artefacts pilfered from its ownmuseums, or destroys ones that don’t fit inside an exclusively materialistunderstanding of a facet of the human experience that can only be understood non-materially. This is how you get conservative incrementalism instead of bold publishing26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"break-throughs, as the junior academics wonder where their next meal will comefrom. There is no history without historiography.STORIES WRITTEN IN BLOOD AND STONEHow are we to proceed if we do not wish to leave the story of us in suchfrequently slippery hands? This comes back to recognising the limitations of whatscientific enquiry does and does not offer. Science values open-minded research butmore often than not fails to get out of its own shadow and see the validity in alternateways of thinking about the world.Science locates its authority in its privileged access to ‘the way things are.’However, because it can occasionally generate repeatable data, it has assumed thatits interpretations are equally Real, that everything comes out of the kitchen perfectand all carrots are always roasted and only served on Tuesdays. Further mutations ofthis error include the presumption that facts can be ignored if they fall outside theboundaries created through self-appointed expertise, as we have seen throughout thischapter. Particularly in historical research, interpretation has been elevated abovehard facts in defining what does and does not exist. The medieval church egregore thatbirthed academia and still gives it its shape is never more visible than in thesemoments.So we begin at this very point of failure; recognising the difference between factsand their interpretation. Unto the archaeologists and chemists do we render thegeneration of radio-carbon data. Unto no one do we render the interpretation of them,especially when it comes to subjects their reality maps do not permit to exist. In noway is this to suggest that we reject all but our own interpretation, it is indeed tosuggest the opposite. We reject all monopolies of interpretation and invite a chorus ofinformed analysis.The journey thus begins with an examination of the data themselves, data thatare generated in systems that suffer the least from interpretive ideology. These are theingredients that show up at the kitchen’s back door, not just the ones that appear onscientism’s à la carte lunch menu. You are now on a strict diet of fresh facts only.Because there is a fundamental disconnect between the generation of facts andthe generation of interpretations, these two concepts move at different speeds,regularly falling out of alignment with each other. A recalibration of interpretation on topof the latest accumulation of facts becomes episodically necessary.These recalibrations have occurred numerous times in the history of western27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"historical research, and are presumably a function of a healthy ideological ecosystem.One of the most effective methods of clearing the biblical Creationists out of the earlydays of the Academy was to invent and unilaterally declare a belief in gradualism.There could be no Flood because geological change happens very slowly, there couldbe no six days of Creation because evolution happens very slowly. In the mediumterm, this was probably a necessary move. However, it set geology back decadesbecause it turns out geological and climatic changes often do happen quickly and therehave certainly been repeated worldwide floods of biblical proportion. The biologicalsciences are sadly still struggling to get out from underneath gradualist beliefs to alarge extent, but their success in doing so requires bringing down Darwin’s entirehouse of cards, so it is still a way off in the distance.A second recalibration happened with the rise of postmodernism. AccompanyingChilde’s belief in the march of civilisation was the academic notion of diffusionism; thesuggestion that technologies and sophisticated concepts occur in one ‘better’ cultureand spread to ‘lesser’ ones. The Aryan Invasion Theory is a prime example ofdiffusionism. It carries with it some very unseemly, racial suggestions of thesuperiority of some groups over others and contributed to the European habit ofstacking cultures into a hierarchy based on alarming and pointless criteria such ascranial fluid capacity and eyelid shape.Like a mother separating her arguing children, postmodernism declared thateveryone invented everything independently. Again, this was probably a necessarystep on the way to de-racialising cultural analysis but it turns out there were a lot ofbabies in that bathwater. The limitations of this approach were almost immediatelyapparent but, by then, much of the damage was done.The damage is typified in the problem of infinite regress. Fixating on individualcontexts becomes smaller and smaller: one cannot make comparisons betweencultures, one then cannot make comparisons between different locations within theculture, one then cannot make comparisons between different age groups within theselocations, one cannot compare old women and young women, and so on. The result isto deny any shared basis between members of the same culture, to say nothing ofhumanity at large. Secondly, the atomisation of shared cultural experience led to therise of a scientific materialist view of what might be shared between humans: youcannot make comparisons between Chinese and Malaysians, but ‘rational thought’ isuniversal. For once, the hijack was accidental, but no less dangerous for being so.As Doniger says, ‘comparison defamiliarizes what we take for granted.’Assumed universals such as rational thought or the experiences of gay men are28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"quickly relativised. Indeed, any attempts to avoid comparison in cultural analysis fallinto the logic trap of comparing the observer’s culture to the one under examination.This is how one accidentally paints one’s own eye instead of the subject under themicroscope.Besides, with the rise of globalisation and digital technology we can see firsthand that ideas and technology certainly do spread between cultures in all directions,even ones with the same eyelid shape.Indeed, the overall quest of this book is to fulfil the Sepik Revelation. To showthat stories and non-physical technology do indeed move between cultures and downthrough time. Perhaps a lot of time. To accomplish this while giving the widestpossible berth to the skeletons hidden in diffusionism’s closet requires more data andless interpretation. Hard data. It is very difficult for a silt layer or an erosion pattern tobe racist. Base pair deletions on your DNA are not especially bothered with how gooda Muslim you really are. And the stars? Well, the stars do not stop turning for anyone.The incorporation of scientific data into metaphysical worldviews is a trackwaynot unknown to magic. Consider the words of Alan Moore in his essay, ‘FossilAngels’:This role, that of an all-inclusive ‘natural philosophy,’ obtained throughout therise of classical civilization and could still be seen, albeit in more furtive fashion,as late as the 16th century, when the occult and mundane sciences were not yetso distinguishable as they are today. It would be surprising, for example, if JohnDee did not allow his knowledge of astrology to colour his invaluablecontributions to the art of navigation, or vice-versa. Not until the Age of Reasongradually prevented our belief in and thus contact with the gods that hadsustained our predecessors did our fledgling sense of rationality identify thesupernatural as a mere vestigial organ in the human corpus, obsolete andpossibly diseased, best excised quickly.There is even more recent precedent worth considering. Whatever else youthink of the Golden Dawn, Theosophy, the Society for Psychical Research and itsindividual adherents, these groups formed during an imperial knowledge explosion.They each reaccumulated the data of the observable facts and launched theirinterpretations from them. It is easy to forget that the first translations, the firstappearances of foreign or ancient knowledge in western esoteric discourse, happeneddue to the diligence of individual occultists. Sometimes it is even easier to forget thatthese underlying facts require episodic updating, and we have not been very good at it,beyond a half-hearted nod at an interpretation of quantum physics that is itself seventy29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"years old.It is the very definition of the Western esoteric tradition to search for the widerphilosophical implications of the latest dispatches from the front of the Real. Scienceexcels at generating facts, but magic has been generating meaning for perhaps fiftythousand years. We have been lax.To abandon interpretation to scientism is to shirk natural philosophy’s mostsacred duty. Your tribe deserves better. And if you feel some residual squeamishnessover who has legitimacy of interpretation in our culture, consider this. We are whollyjustified in turning the question on its head and asking the scientists what it is theythink they are doing swimming in our pool in the first place.RESTORING MITHRAS: AN EXAMPLEIt continues to surprise those in the hard sciences just how much theunavoidable politics of the workplace extends into the actual subjects studied by theirsofter colleagues. Having encountered Dechend and Santillana’s Hamlet’s Mill, Italianphysicist Giulio Magli endeavoured to write a more scientific paper looking for thepossible prehistoric discovery of astronomical precession, rather than making theclaim, as Santillana had, that all prehistoric cultures were aware of the phenomenon.When he looked at the cult of Mithras for his 2004 article, ‘On the PossibleDiscovery of Precessional Effects in Ancient Astronomy,’ Magli noted that, ‘the historyof modern Mithraic studies is very instructive and almost unbelievable.’Overwhelmingly, Mithras is depicted as a young man, looking away from a bull whilekilling it with a sword. Under the bull, a scorpion strikes at its genitals. Depictions of adog, serpent, crow, drinking vessel and a lion are extremely common. In the 1890s, aBelgian scholar by the name of Franz Cumont decided that Mithraism was an Iraniancult dedicated to a being known as Mithra. This is despite the almost complete lack ofparallels between the two cults, including the presumably important bull sacrifice. Toget around this, Cumont pulled the bull slaying from a separate Iranian myth involvingAhriman, in which Mithra is entirely absent.It astounded Magli to note that the Cumont Doctrine persisted unchallenged upuntil 1970, even though the astronomical imagery in the Mithraic cult could not bemore obvious if the god were depicted in a pointy hat with stars and crescent moonson it. The possibility of an astronomical interpretation was firmly quashed by theBelgian and remained a forbidden idea for more than seven decades.Once the forbidden idea was readmitted, Mithraic studies grew in leaps and30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"bounds. The mysteries of the cult were reflected in the star lore of the ancient nightsky. The bull is Taurus, rising heliacally at the spring equinox in 2000 BC. Thescorpion is Scorpio, rising in the same era at the autumnal equinox. The vessel isprobably Aquarius. The celestial equator in 2000 BC crossed Taurus, Canis Major (adog), Hydra (a serpent) and a scorpion. As for the lion, Leo was the summer solsticeconstellation at the same time. We thus have the tantalising possibility of a warriorgod who is strong enough to fix and move the stars, a very compelling proposition forsoldiers. Why lock in a date so long before the emerge of the cult? It was the end of theage in which Taurus rose in the east with the equinox sunrise. It was the death of thebull.But whither the god himself? Mithras was probably not Orion as the asterism isseen from earth as being under Taurus, not above it as Mithras is in relation to his bull.In 1989, David Ulansey noticed that there is another asterism above Taurus, and thatis Perseus. Perseus, depicted wearing a Phrygian cap. Just like Mithras.Almost by definition, the archaeology of mystery cults suffers from a near-totalabsence of evidence. However it seems quite obvious that at least some aspects ofstar lore moved into and through this cult the way Bible stories moved in the upperreaches of the Sepik River.Seventy five years may seem like a long time for an entire field of study to go offin the wrong direction, but it is actually only a few ‘scholarly generations.’ Cumont’sbest students – the ones who agree with him – become professors. Those professorshave students and then begin to die off. Suddenly we see the tentative emergence ofnew interpretations, blinking in the sunlight. It is then only a scant few years before anew canon comes roaring to life, sweeping away the old. Returning to Max Planck’squote at the top of the chapter, this is how the eternal conflict between fact andinterpretation plays out, this is how science advances ... one funeral at a time.Book the hearse.31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"IIAll our theories were wrong.Ian Hodder, Stanford UniversityTHE CATHEDRALPREDATES THE CITYBefore we knew how to farm, before we lived in villages, before we even knewhow to make pots, we built a star temple on a hill. The simplicity of this statementbelies its astounding implications. With one motion it demolishes Childe’s materialistanalysis of the human journey. We did not build Göbekli Tepe in Southeastern Turkeybecause a surplus of stored food allowed a priestly class to emerge and tell us make-believe stories. We did not monitor the movements of the stars because it told uswhen to plant crops, because we weren’t planting crops.We built Göbekli Tepe because it expressed something about ourselves and ourplace in the universe. The temple complex restores the quest for meaning to itspreeminent place atop the goals of human life. Philosophy is rescued from being amere nighttime hobby of farmers to being the defining human trait, that which we valuemost. This is what the site’s discoverer, Dr Klaus Schmidt, means when he says thatthe cathedral predates the city. It may well have been the coming together for spiritualreasons that birthed settled cultures, rather than the other way around. We mayliterally state that mankind had civilising gods (for better or for worse!). Göbekli Tepeis probably the most important archaeological discovery of all time.It is impossible to overestimate just how rare, just how precious such a findreally is. There is barely any of Victorian London left a scant century of change later.Göbekli Tepe is at least twelve thousand years old. That is seven thousand years olderthan the Giza complex. The Great Pyramid is closer in time to us than it is to thecreation of Göbekli Tepe. Writing in his National Geographic article, ‘The Birth ofReligion,’ Charles C. Mann says that, ‘Göbekli Tepe was like finding that someonehad built a 747 in a basement with an X-Acto knife.’Unlike other sources of pseudohistorical speculation – such as selectiveinterpretations of Sumerian tablets or the wilful misreadings of Mayan carvingsbearing a squinting resemblance to 1960s space suits – Göbekli Tepe, once seen,32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"cannot be unseen. Its existence is a fact rather than an interpretation. A fact that hasbeen easier to ignore than engage with over the last twenty years. Writing in ‘Turkey:Archaeological Dig Reshaping Human History,’ an article for Newsweek, PatrickSymmes observes, ‘the real reason the ruins at Göbekli remain almost unknown, notyet incorporated in textbooks, is that the evidence is too strong, not too weak. “Theproblem with this discovery,” as Schwartz of Johns Hopkins puts it, “is that it isunique.”’Uniqueness. The career academic’s least favourite thing.AN UNCOMMON DISCOVERYFor Göbekli Tepe to even exist today requires a string of low-probability eventsso remarkable that you would be forgiven for calling it fate.Firstly, the entire site was deliberately and delicately buried in 8200 BC afterthousands of years of continual use. In terms of scale, this burial was a communityproject equal to or greater than Göbekli Tepe’s original construction, with some 300cubic metres per enclosure, so there must have been a very important reason behindit. In and of itself, the burial is highly unusual. You only need to drive past an abandonedchurch to see that changing belief systems result in the abandonment of places ofworship or, only slightly less commonly, in iconoclasm. And while there is somesuggestion of scattered iconoclasm at Göbekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe, one does notsee old churches wrapped in bubble wrap.The second event that spared Göbekli Tepe is the sheer weight of time. Althoughthe region was probably continuously occupied, it would be more than four thousandyears before the early Mesopotamian civilisations began large scale sacred buildinganywhere near there. To paraphrase Tolkien, history became legend, legend becamemyth, and for ten thousand years the rings of stone passed out of all knowledge. It isjust possible that there remains a cultural echo of this history/legend/myth continuum.Atop the mound of Göbekli Tepe is a ziyaret, a place of pilgrimage within the folkmagic of the local cultures. In this case it is a single tree in an otherwise barrenlandscape, where locals will come to ask favours and leave small ribbons orofferings.The final event that kept the site safe until its discovery by Dr Schmidt inOctober of 1994 was its misidentification as a graveyard, possibly a Byzantine orMuslim one, in 1963. Due to religious law, it is not permitted to disturb the remains ofdeceased Muslims. In that year, the site was first identified as Stone Age by Americanarchaeologist, Peter Benedict. He missed that the entire hill he was standing on was33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"man-made, referenced a graveyard but did not specify if it was modern or Byzantine,and then walked down off and away from the greatest archaeological discovery hewould never make.For three decades, Göbekli Tepe was relegated to a largely uninteresting entryin an aging site survey, until, in 1994, Dr Schmidt committed himself to visiting allknown Stone Age sites in the area around Nevali Çori, a previously discoveredNeolithic settlement nearby. He recognised what Benedict missed and has beenexcavating the site ever since.LOCATING GÖBEKLI TEPE IN TIME AND SPACEFrom the perspective of previous academic theories about the development ofcivilisation, we have seen that Göbekli Tepe should probably not exist. And from theperspective of the sheer volume of elapsed time between its creation and our modernage, we have seen that it should not have survived. This makes the site exceedinglyrare.With rarity comes the danger of overinflating the significance of a discovery, asif only the most important sites could have survived into the modern day. This may notalways be the case. Someone has to win the lottery, after all, and winning does notconfer retroactive significance on the lucky ticket holder. There may have beenhundreds of sites like Göbekli Tepe stretching right across the Levant and CentralAsia. Indeed, there are smaller temple sites in the same area, such as Karahan Tepe,which indicate that whatever cosmology expressed in the site design was at leastlocally distributed.That being said, while the cosmology itself appears to have been widelydispersed, there is good evidence that Göbekli Tepe itself had higher status as a holyplace within this belief system than any nearby sites, and so should be looked at mostclosely. This evidence comes principally from analysis on 130 obsidian samples fromGöbekli Tepe by Tristan Carter of McMaster University.34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"fig. 2Göbekli TepeObsidian found in situ originated in multiple locations from up to 300 miles away,and is stylistically similar to objects found in Iraq and Iran. Whilst there is no way ofknowing whether the artefacts were taken directly to Göbekli Tepe or form afingerprint of a long-vanished trading network it is largely irrelevant in determining thestatus of the site. Either way the site was a hub, known throughout the land. And so weare placed in the situation of estimating the footprint of something non-physical, abelief system, by mapping it to the footprint of something physical; in this case anobsidian trading network. It is a supposition, to be sure, but a sound one. In any case,in an era that predates the written word by more than five thousand years, supposition– interpretation – is the best we are going to get.Göbekli Tepe is located in the upper arc of what we now call the FertileCrescent. To the north are forested mountains, to the east is the biblical plain ofHarran and stretching away to the south are the storied lands of Mesopotamia. On aclear day you can see into modern Syria from its summit. About fifty kilometres to thesouth east is another temple complex of T-shaped pillars arranged in ovoid layoutscalled Karahan Tepe, which is three times smaller and, at last dating, several35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"centuries younger than its more famous sibling.A similar distance to the north is the settlement of Nevali Çori, which is almost athousand years younger than the earliest layers of Göbekli Tepe and was flooded in1992 during the building of the Ataturk Dam. It was not a temple but one of the world’soldest permanent settlements.So Göbekli Tepe was in use before the beginnings of settled life and agriculture,and remained in use after Childe’s ‘Neolithic Revolution’ began in earnest. Here wecome to a very important, ‘blink and you missed it’ swapping out of fact andinterpretation, the understanding of which is crucial for a magical analysis of the site.According to the preliminary excavation report for the 2013 season, calibrated datingon charcoal residue in some of the ring walls gives a date for their construction earlyin the tenth millennium BC. Given that only a minority of the site has been excavated,and shaped bedrock was discovered underneath one of the enclosures in the sameseason, Dr Schmidt will be the first to tell you that the earliest evidence of usage is notevidence of first usage. He has said on numerous occasions that he expects the dateof first use to be pushed back even farther.But even with the dating where it is, the earliest use of the site predates settledagriculture by centuries. Thus, any attempts to interpret the complex as ‘a templeshowing the transition from hunter-gathering to settled agriculture’ need to be seen forwhat they are: an academic attempt to claw Göbekli Tepe back inside their old modelwhere savages cannot build and barbarians can. It softens the blow on their beliefsystem somewhat, because it moves the large-scale monument building into an erawhen people were already constructing things anyway, rather than having to face theevidence that humans clearly built things that were important to them long before theemergence of the agricultural economics typically used to ‘explain’ such behaviour.From a distance of twelve millennia out, five or more centuries does not looklike a huge amount of time, so few people bat an eye when academics describesomething as astonishing as Göbekli Tepe as belonging to a culture transitioning tosettled, agricultural life. But this is like saying that the Gutenberg Press was createdas part of our transition into the European Union. It is a nonsensical attempt to cling tothe old interpretation despite the discovery of new, unambiguous facts.No one is arguing that the latest stages of the complex do not post-date theadoption of agriculture, but this observation is being used to mask the fact that theearliest stages very much do not. The earliest stages of Göbekli Tepe – the largest andmost sophisticated stages – are not the beginning of ‘barbarism,’ they are the very end36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"of ‘savagery.’ Returning to the Newsweek article, we read, ‘[t]he temples thus offerunexpected proof that mankind emerged from the 140,000 year reign of hunter-gatherers with a ready vocabulary of spiritual imagery, and capable of huge logistical,economic and political efforts.’Before anyone thinks of calling the by-now-ironically-named History Channel,the technical complexity of the site, whilst hugely impressive, is not in any waymysterious. In fact, that is one of the main points. In theory, humanity had the technicalskill to construct the temple for tens of millennia before Göbekli Tepe was built, andthis is but a very rare survival of it. You build Göbekli Tepe by hitting rocks with otherrocks, then standing them up. No aliens required.The anomaly is non-physical rather than physical: it is what this impressivecomplex reveals about the majesty and sophistication of the hunter-gatherer’s innerlandscape. As Johns Hopkins archaeologist Glenn Schwartz points out, this is the firsttime we see humans express the notion that they resemble gods. That has hugecosmological implications for how we view our distant past.If V. Gordon Childe gave us some artificial horizons we should largely ignore,there are some very real physical ones we cannot. We often mistake a dearth ofevidence for the cultural landscape of our hunter-gatherers for the belief that theyprobably did not have much of one. Large-scale ochre mining took place in Africa’sMiddle Stone Age over 100,000 years ago, and evidence of its use is still occasionallyfound dating before even that. However as professors Miranda and Stephen Aldhouse-Green, both of the University of Wales, Newport, point out in The Quest for theShaman, art, once painted on cave walls older than 30,000 years generally nowsurvives only as collapsed fragments. We face an immovable temporal barrierbeyond which it is largely impossible to see with the spectacles of archaeology.Fortunately, there are other spectacles in the dedicated folklorist’s toolkit whichwe shall come to in subsequent chapters. In the meantime, it is important to realisethat we really have few ways of knowing just when this high complexity of non-physical technology began, given fully modern humans existed for at least 200,000years before the ‘Palaeolithic Consciousness Revolution’ we see beginning atLascaux and culminating on a flint mound in South East Turkey. From a physicalevidence perspective, we have a clearly defined palaeontological window.In the satirical newspaper, The Onion, there is a popular article from more thana decade ago titled ‘Archaeologist tired of unearthing unspeakable, ancient evil.’ Whilethis is a comment on Hollywood depictions of the field, it has a curious real world37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"analogue. Great archaeological discoveries often trigger western esoteric revolutionsas their ontological implications disseminate into the wider culture. Samuel and MoinaMathers first met in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum, for instance, and it isunlikely the sixties counterculture would have looked the way it did without the mid-twentieth century anthropological research into American Indian beliefs. Göbekli Tepefalls into the trigger category. In many ways the site is a new Rosetta Stone. It sitsright at the very edge of a way of life we have at least some frame of reference for:settled agriculture; and overlaps another way of life for which we have none: hunter-gathering. Thus, written in both a language we can understand and one that we cannot,it offers our first and best opportunity to unlock the mysteries of mankind’s earliest andlongest-lived culture. It is a key made of stone and starlight.SITE SURVEYGöbekli Tepe is quite large, covering some nine hectares. Geophysical surveyssuggest its total size may be more than thirty hectares. Prior to the construction of thetemples, it was very likely a flint quarry used for the creation of spear and possiblyarrow tips. This may be relevant in determining the nature of the gods and spirits thatwere eventually venerated there.The site is characterised by two main layers. Layer II, the younger, revealsrectangular buildings and iconography that indicate that it belongs to the same cultureas the nearby settlement of Nevali Çori. Whilst the story of mankind’s first knownsettled towns is endlessly fascinating in and of itself, we shall not dwell on it for toolong. Civilisation, such as it is, had begun in earnest by this point.

They are often very tall andthin, and thus quite unstable, perhaps another indication of their ritual significance anduse which will be explored below. Layer III is definitively preagricultural, although thelarge number of sickles found at the site demonstrates that wild grains, probably forthe brewing of beer, formed part of the culture’s diet.As only a minority of the hill has been excavated so far, it seems likely that thereare around twenty of these early circular enclosures covering the top and southernface of Göbekli Tepe. Later circles are less than half the size of the earlier ones whichhas been interpreted as indicating that the culture was in decline in later years.Each of the enclosures is named in the order of its discovery: Enclosure A,Enclosure B, and so on. The pillars are often carved in both high and low relief andsome imagery is more common in one enclosure compared to the next. For instance,Enclosure A has more snake imagery than Enclosure B, which has more fox imagery.The largest is Enclosure D. It has two very large central pillars and 12 smallerones surrounding it. The central pillars are the best examples of the compelling T-shaped humanoid figures that characterise many of the pillars on the site. In this casethey have long thin arms reaching around to the belly area, some form of neckadornment and belts with what is probably a fox skin covering the groin. The beltsthemselves have a curious buckle or symbol that looks like our capital H. The centralpillars face south. They do not appear to have a discernable gender. According to thepreliminary excavation report for the 2013 season, large volumes of charred botanicalremains were found, offering the exciting possibility of further calibrating the date ofuse.Just to the southeast is Enclosure C. It has several concentric, interwoven wallscontaining smaller T-pillars around the two large central ones, at least one of whichwas probably deliberately toppled in antiquity. The diameter of the entire enclosure isapproximately 30 metres. Enclosure C’s floor is of cut, smoothed bedrock, out ofwhich were also carved the 30 cm pedestals for the two large T-pillars. Described inthe same preliminary report is the discovery that Enclosure C was changedsubstantially during its use. A south-facing entrance passage consisting of two40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"narrowly-set walls entering into the larger, outer circle via what is described as aportal stone. At some point, this passageway was deliberately walled up. In 2012, acarved stairway was discovered at the entry-point of the passageway. Although thepassage points almost due south, Enclosure C’s central pillars point slightly moresouth-southeast, offering the suggestion that the temple’s principal sacred axis haschanged over time.IMAGERY ANALYSISIt is not just the conspicuous absence of any farmed animals in the largevolumes of bones and detritus used as fill for the enclosures that tells us this is ahunters’ temple, it is also the imagery.Around half of the pillars so far excavated feature some astonishing reliefcarvings. The majority of the imagery depicted in Layer III relates to prey, alphapredators or otherwise dangerous animals, such as scorpions and snakes. You wouldnot leave your children with any of the animals found on this hill. From the outset, wecan see that Göbekli Tepe is not an example of ‘primitive sympathetic magic,’designed to ensure a successful hunt. (I would argue that such an exclusiveinterpretation is largely incorrect anywhere in the Palaeolithic, but that is a separateissue.) Sources of food such as the aurochs, wild ass, gazelle and boar – in someinstances depicted upside down – can certainly be found. But there are also manyfoxes, lions, leopards, cranes, storks, ibises, vultures and what may well be acrocodile, a culinary delicacy for which Southeast Turkey is not exactly famous. Moreon that later.Different imagery tends to predominate in different enclosures. For instance,foxes and snakes are most common in Enclosure D. Enclosure C has no snakes but alot more boars. It is not unreasonable to suggest that each enclosure had a presidinganimal spirit, perhaps even the totemic spirit of the family group who may have‘sponsored’ its construction. What has been described as a totem pole, carved withsnakes and topped with birds, has been found in the northeast corner of a room inLayer II, so the interpretation may have merit.The majority of the site’s imagery is carved in low relief, although there aresome exceptional examples of high relief carvings that Dr Schmidt has interpreted as‘temple guardians.’ So far, all high relief depictions have been of ‘ferocious’ animalsrather than game, lending credence to the hypothesis. In both cases, it is important toemphasise that the imagery is created by taking a larger stone and carving offeverything around the depiction. With the pillars that include high relief sculptures, this41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"means starting with a considerably larger piece of rock. Make a mistake and startagain. These were not the idle scratchings of superstitious minds, they were plannedinclusions from the very outset, and so were clearly weighty with meaning.The high relief carvings tell us something else important, and that is that theeerie, quasi-human feel of the central T-pillars was a deliberate stylistic choice. Theywere not the crude attempts of a culture struggling with accurate depictions of theirkings or chiefs. Some frankly very beautiful examples of stylistic naturalism can befound at Göbekli Tepe, even down to the individual carving of teeth and tusks. Thosegiant, faceless, thin-armed humanoids with jointed fingers, wearing fox-pelt over theirbelts with H-shaped buckles and strange neck charms, hovering in the centre of thesacred space are supposed to look like that. It almost makes you want to sleep withthe light on.It is worth considering the preponderance of snake depictions at some length. Inat least once instance, the snakes are interwoven into a grid or mat, which is highlysuggestive of the ectopic phenomena first seen when an entheogen begins to takeeffect. Indeed, ayahuasca, for instance, is often depicted as a female snake spirit.Geometric patterns coalesce into snakeskin, which coalesces into a giant snake andthen the rest of the journey begins in earnest. Other single snakes are depictedcrawling up the back or the side of the T-pillars. In Nevali Çori – which is a latersettlement than Layer III – fully anthropoid statues were found with a snake climbingup the spine, over the top of the human head, with the snake’s head ending in thecentre of the forehead. The extremely high degree of similarity between this statue andboth the Ancient Egyptian Uraeus and the Kundalini cannot be ignored.In fact, in light of Nevali Çori’s twentieth century discovery, it is worth bearing inmind that the land surrounding it during its occupation, with verdant grasslands,pistachio trees, einkorn wheat, oak, elm, wild sheep, pigs and cattle is an exact matchfor descriptions found in India’s oldest religious texts, the Rig Veda. It is descriptionssuch as these that definitely rule out an exclusively Indian origin for Vedic culture – towhich we will return in later chapters – but is presented here to demonstrate thestrong circumstantial evidence of a continuity of cosmologies.The possibility that Göbekli Tepe was a site of ritualised drug use is one that DrSchmidt thinks is highly likely. Rectangular pits that were likely used for the brewingof beer – discussed below – have already been found on site and similar locations.Mandrake beer is known in Ancient Egypt from the legend of Sekhmet, where herconsumption of it – as a proxy for human blood, no less – transformed her into thebenevolent Hathor, ‘the giver of life’ after a drug-induced sleep. (The Old Arabic term42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"for mandrake is Abu’ l-ruh, ‘master of the life breath.’) It was also added to wine inBacchic rites. In both instances we have much later echoes of the securing ofimmortality or transformation via an entheogen-induced shamanic journey.None of this rules out the possibility that other, more traditional, shamanic allieswere used. Along the top of the western side of the famous Pillar 43 in Enclosure D –the largest enclosure – are a sequence of images that look like three modern padlocksin profile. Graham Hancock refers to these as, ‘the shaman’s manbags.’ But it is thecarvings below these manbags that lend the interpretation credence.Immediately below the manbags and at the base of the pillar are depictions ofseveral cranes. The crane, like the ibis, is the shamanic animal par excellence,because it occupies the three worlds of land, water and air, moving seamlesslybetween them at will. Thoth, appearing fully-formed at the very beginning of DynasticEgypt, is probably one example of the civilisational development of this intermediary,wisdom-imparting being. In other enclosures, dozens of smaller cranes are carvedaround the edges of the bases in which the central T-pillars stand. This animal is insome way involved in the comings and goings of presiding spirits of these temples,and quite possibly the humans who use it as well.43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"fig. 4Pillar 43, Göbekli TepeTo the right of the large crane at the base of Pillar 43, although damaged, is a44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"carving of a headless human with an erect penis. In between the small human at thebase of the statue and the cranes and manbags at the top is a large scorpion and – inwhat is the largest carving yet found at the site – a large vulture or vulture/humantherianthrope carrying a circular shape in its wing. Although some interpretationssuggest this could be the sun, it is quite small and there is a headless human at thebase of the pillar, so it is probably better understood as a head. Esoterically, it could beboth, of course.The combination of the bird – most often the vulture – and the head is repeatedseveral times throughout the entire site. During the 2012 season, a larger-than-lifesize, realistic human head in the talons of a large bird was discovered in a deepsounding trench in the main excavation area. This is an image that is well-known fromNevali Çori and is thus highly suggestive of the continuation of ‘headlessness’ and thespecial significance of the head from the deep Palaeolithic into the post-agriculturalera. Other carved heads have been discovered in the fill of various enclosures, andare curiously evocative of some comparatively nearby cultic practices in Jericho, ‘AinGhazal and Tell Aswad, where human skulls were removed from corpses and givennew faces made from gypsum plaster before being installed in ancestral shrines. Asfar back as 26,000 years ago (doubling the distance between Göbekli Tepe and us),graves where the skulls have been painted with red ochre are found. From the sameera, the Gravettian graves – found across Europe – often contain headless skeletonsor sometimes just skulls.Let us not forget that the central pillars are themselves headless in a sense. Inplace of a skull and face, the deliberate stylistic decision was made to carve a narrowrectangular prism. Whatever these beings are, they are humanish, but decidedly nothuman in scale or appearance despite the artistic capacity to depict both being found atthe site. They display neither gender nor race. And separating your head from yourbody seems to please them.Returning to the possibility that Göbekli Tepe may function as a Rosetta Stone,the metaphor of the mangrove swamp is useful. The mangrove swamp is where theunknown ocean of the Deep Palaeolithic overlaps with the recognisable land of settledagricultural life. It is both places and neither. The twenty thousand years ofentheogenic, ritualised shamanism between the Lascaux Caves and Göbekli Tepe –the longest-running psychological experiment in the history of mankind – areevidenced in the spiritual practices found on this flint hill in modern Turkey.Quite what it was these practices made contact with may also be in evidence.‘Twenty years ago everyone believed civilization was driven by ecological forces,’45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Schmidt told National Geographic. ‘I think what we are learning is that civilization is aproduct of the human mind.’ASTROTHEOLOGYDr Schmidt has referred to the T-pillars as ‘a gathering of heavenly beings.’Despite some of them weighing in at over five tonnes, the extremely narrow ‘feet’ ofthe central T-pillars, resting in very shallow bases of only a few inches, give thecurious impression of beings just barely landing on the ground.Invisible from below, many of the tops of the T-pillars have ‘cup marks’ facing upto the sky, like those found in much later Neolithic sites across Britain, as well as inSouthern India, Sulawesia, Korea and Japan. K. P. Rao of the University of Hyderabadhas correlated some of the Southern Indian cup marks with constellations such asOrion and Ursa Major. In the case of Göbekli Tepe, I suspect these may have beenfilled with a liquid that could reflect and catch the starlight as in a mirror but that is myinterpretation of the fact of their existence. (In later eras, it was quite common to‘catch’ starlight in liquid.) Combined with the fundamental structural unsoundness oftall, narrow, heavy pillars resting precariously on carved bases, the existence of thecup marks suggests the enclosures were open to the night sky. Nothing resemblingroofing has yet been found in the fill, but this may change as excavations continue.The smaller, surrounding pillars facing into the central ones most commonlynumber twelve, but sometimes only ten. The number twelve, combined with imagesof the scorpion, the lion, the aurochs, some kind of reptile/dragon, the vulture and so onmake it hugely tempting to leap to a zodiacal explanation for the enclosure’sarrangement.Perhaps this is so, but it is certainly more prudent to refer to Göbekli Tepe as a‘proto-zodiac.’ Evidence of star lore and even, according to one NASA study, solarplasma events such as the Northern Lights, are indicated in Palaeolithic cavepaintings in Europe and Australia. Star lore is extremely old, astrology significantlyless so. Göbekli Tepe is probably our earliest evidence (so far) of attempting to coheremany pieces of star lore into a unifying cosmology, but you still cannot determine yournatal chart with it. We see star lore with Dr Doniger’s telescope, we see astrologywith her microscope. It is a recipe for madness to confuse the two, one that is nothelped by the fact that it is a Greek word with no Egyptian or Babylonian cognates.Precisely when star lore becomes astrology is largely a matter of opinion.There is a common misconception that the Ice Age was wet, cold and snowy.Certainly, it would have been cold in Northern Europe but, at the time, a huge amount46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of the planet’s water was locked up in glaciers and polar ice caps, so it was actuallyquite dry for much of the earth. Twenty thousand years of coming up on mushroomsunder a canopy of stars undimmed by light pollution, industry or high atmosphericmoisture can only have generated a profound and complex cosmology. It was the onlyshow in town, after all, and you and I will never see it performed the way ourancestors did. We have mistaken the absence of evidence for the evidence of absenceof Palaeolithic star lore and Göbekli Tepe appears, on the last page of a very longbook, to correct that mistake.As to the suggestion of solar influences at Göbekli Tepe, this interpretation isvanishingly weak. Firstly, why would non-agriculturalists care about the sun?Secondly, the enclosures are not circular, they are ovoid or womb-shaped. Butperhaps most importantly, it is the north/south axis – with a particular emphasis on thesouth – that predominates over the east/west axis found in solar-aligned complexes.The pre-eminence of the sun in our earliest spiritual beliefs has been grossly over-inflated thanks largely to nineteenth century antiquarianism and the assumption thatour ancestors were stupid enough to fear and misunderstand this bright object in thesky. Göbekli Tepe restores the star goddess and her children to their thrones.Now we come to the potential alignments themselves. All the Layer III enclosureentrances and central T-pillars face south to southeast. It is reasonable to suggest thatwe should look in that corner of the night sky for the principal asterism. This does notpreclude the presence of asterisms in other corners of the sky being represented, ofcourse. Indeed, if this is a stellar temple it stands to reason that they probably were.Completely covered by a northeast wall of a rectangular room from the later Layer II,a totem pole reminiscent of those found in North America was discovered with what isprobably a bear at its top. The northeast corner of the night sky contains Ursa Major,or the Bear. So it is possible that the association between this particular site and thestars was long-lived.Returning to Layer III, the fact remains that the earliest enclosures all point to ahighly resonant corner of the sky, so it is there that we shall look. There is also the factthat the oldest temples are on top of the tell (‘hill’) and the younger ones move furtherdown the south face. We would not expect this from a site whose principal directionwas anything other than ‘southish.’The entry ‘portals’ to the central ellipses do not all point in the same direction,but rather drift from a general southerly one with the earliest temple, to a moresouthest direction for the later ones. It needs to be borne in mind that each enclosurewas deliberately buried before the next one was constructed (or thereabouts). It47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"occurred to Boston University geologist Dr Robert Schoch that the directional changemay have been caused by the results of precession. Reconstructing the night skyduring the time the enclosures were in use, he noted that:On the morning of the vernal equinox circa 10,000 BCE, before the sun rose dueeast at Göbekli Tepe, the Pleiades, Taurus, and the top of Orion were in view inthe direction indicated by the central stones of Enclosure D ... with Orion’s Beltnot far above the horizon as dawn broke (as seen from the best vantage points inthe area). A similar scenario played out for the orientation of the central stones ofEnclosure C in circa 9500 BCE and for Enclosure B in circa 9000 BCE.Enclosure A is oriented toward the Pleiades, Taurus and Orion on the morning ofthe Vernal Equinox circa 8500 BCE, but due to precessional changes, the entirebelt of Orion no longer rose above the horizon before dawn broke. By about 8150BCE the belt of Orion remained below the horizon at dawn on the vernalequinox. These dates fit well the time frame established for Göbekli Tepe on thebasis of radiocarbon dating. Furthermore, Orion the constellation can be viewedas literally a torso in the sky with arms (but not legs), a headless hunter, similarto the iconography of the headless hunters represented by the central pillars ofEnclosure D.Dr Giulio Magli, who we met in the last chapter via his analysis of theastronomical components to the Mithras story, has also performed anarchaeoastronomic survey of Göbekli Tepe and reached a different conclusion.Although his contention is that an Orion correlation would lead to too high a date for thestructure, this is a premature analysis given that only a minority of the site has beenexcavated, and Dr Schmidt fully expects the evidence for first use to be pushed furtherback – his matching of the night sky to the date of Enclosure D as revealed in thepreliminary report for the 2013 excavation season is closer than Dr Schoch’s: 9300BC. This is within one hundred years of the latest carbon dates and given there is anunavoidable fuzziness in both radiocarbon dating and reconstructions of the ancientsky, it is effectively a bull’s eye.At the latitude of Göbekli Tepe in 9300 BC, the night sky welcomed back a visitorthat had not been seen for more than five thousand years. Sirius. The hunter’scompanion had returned.As Sirius is a negative magnitude star, it is in principle visible just above thehorizon; I will however allow in what follows as altitude of 1/2° (actually thehorizon at the site estimated via satellite images looks flat towards the south-east). Then, it can be seen that the above azimuths match the rising azimuths of48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Sirius in the following approximate dates:StructureD172°9100 BCEStructureC165°8750 BCEStructureB159°8300 BCEThe arc of sky covering Sirius/Canis Minor, Orion and then the Pleiades/Taurushas been a cultural focus for humans for tens of thousands of years. You can find themin Lascaux, you can also (possibly) see Orion in a 32,500 year old mammoth ivorycarving found in Germany. Given the obvious symbolic parallels between Orion, the‘armed but headless’ T-pillars and the status of Göbekli Tepe as a hunters’ temple – astestified by the fact that the feasting remains are exclusively wild taxa and the tell itselfwas used to mine flint – it is reasonable to suggest that Dr Schmidt’s ‘heavenly being’is represented by the asterism we call Orion.How are we to square the better symbolic parallels with Orion with the moreaccurate (so far) astronomic parallels with Sirius? For magicians, this is almost selfevident. The hunter had acquired a companion, the brightest star in the sky at thatlatitude, no less. This is a cosmological event worth memorialising, worth celebrating.We have no way of knowing whether our ancestors saw Sirius as a femalecompanion – or even really if they saw Orion as male – we only know that they arecompanions, two stellar beings appearing to chase Taurus across the sky just as theherds migrate across the planes below, and just as there are two pillars in the centreof each enclosure, an otherwise uncommon temple arrangement.It is not yet a solid, but the plot has certainly thickened.RITUAL, FEASTING AND DEATH AT GÖBEKLITEPEThe role of food and drink on this particular tell needs to be explored at somelength, as it attests to both the status and function of the site.49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Firstly, there is no water source nearby capable of sustaining a permanentsettlement and no evidence of food preparation or waste has been found to suggest thatGöbekli Tepe was occupied year-round. It was a site of supreme importance, but notone that was built to live in. That being said, Dr Schmidt has recently conceded thetemple may have had a guardian who had food and water delivered to him/her/them bypassing tribes, but evidence for this has yet to be uncovered. This is not to say there isno evidence of food consumption at Göbekli Tepe. Rather, there is too much of it. Largevolumes of animal bones, smashed to get at the marrow, have been found in thebackfill of the enclosures, in amounts exceeding everything known from other sites atthe time. Here is a very strong indication that the tell was a place of regular pilgrimagefor surrounding tribes and family groups.The health of the animal bones also speaks to the sacred function of the site. Inone of the more flimsy attempts to pull Göbekli Tepe back into line with the outdatedparadigm, Karl W. Luckert of Missouri State suggests that the temple’s grandeur anduniqueness was a sign of desperation; appealing to the gods of the hunt in the face of achanging climate and the disappearance of the herds. (He also suggests the T-pillarsare upside down phalluses, penetrating the earth mother. The book is notrecommended.)However, in the introduction to Luckert’s own book, Dr Schmidt – wasting onlyone sentence before announcing his complete disagreement with the theory presentedtherein – mentions that the end of the Ice Age was a period of superabundance for thisparticular corner of Asia Minor. Rainfall increased, grasslands spread, herds grew.We see this reflected in the health of the feasting bones. The ritual attendees atGöbekli Tepe were not a hungry people.We see a similar attempt to pull the earliest stages of the site back into aparadigm that allows anthropologists who have been teaching the wrong thing for fortyyears to continue doing so, in the suggestion that the site was a roofed, domesticdwelling. Such analysis ignores the complete absence of domestic waste found at thesite, the fundamental instability of the central pillars for housing, the absence ofroofing, the lack of water and the ritualistic burial and replacement of each enclosure.Also, contemporaneous dwellings are rectangular rather than elliptical, as we see atNevali Çori – a site that also contains separate sacred and domestic structures. Theinterpretation relies solely on the straw man suggestion that hunter gatherers did notrecognise a difference between the physical and the sacred, so these were houses inwhich they also maybe conducted rituals. The non-separation between the physicaland the spiritual may be so, but you will also not find a single hunter gatherer societylacking in taboo areas, that is, spaces demarcated as belonging to the spirits rather50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"than the tribe. It is imperative that a domestic reading of Göbekli Tepe be recognisedfor the academic gerrymandering that it is, and banished with laughter.Risky though it is, a comparison with a much more recent hunter gathererculture may be illuminating. The Boorong of Southeast Australia waited for Otchocut,the giant fish, to set with the sun. They then moved north to the Mille river, upon thebanks of which their cousins dwelled.Otchocut’s sunset alignment coincided with the cod returning to the river tospawn. Travelling at night, ancestral and totemic spirit constellations would passoverhead, from east to west. Like many sophisticated hunter gatherer cultures,Boorong law required exogamy, or marrying outside the tribe. And so, on the banks ofthe Mille, families would reunite, celebrate, compete at spear-throwing, feast andarrange weddings. In the evenings, the young warriors would attempt to out-danceeach other. As Alex Cherney and John Morieson point out in their paper at the 2010conference of the La Société Européenne pour l’Astronomie dans la Culture:The Boorong might stay for several weeks especially if there was ceremony totake place, such as first initiation for boys or girls. By now the full heat ofsummer was upon them so on their journey home to proceed at night was theonly option. If the northern sky was a progression from east to west, thesouthern sky was a revolving scene where all the named ancestral heroes werevisible for all the time, but sometimes hidden in the treetops. Bunya the possumwas very evident at the top of the Southern Cross and every woman’s totem,Yerredetkurrk, the owlet nightjar, is directly opposite in what we call Achernar.Halfway between the two is south so all the Boorong had to do was to keep inline with the halfway point and in three to four days they would be home.It is unlikely the family groups of Asia Minor arrived at Göbekli Tepe expectingcod. What we have with the Boorong is a proof of concept that star lore can be used toguide disparate populations to a specific site for a multitude of spiritual and practicalreasons. Certainly, there would have been the same need for exogamy, as we werenot even living in villages at the time, so inbreeding would have been a constant risk.There is even the indication for dancing, or at least music, being important atGöbekli Tepe. Firstly, and most astonishingly, the central T-pillars hum. If you slapsome of them with the palm of your hand, they vibrate like a tuning fork, thus probablyuncovering the reason for their extremely shallow bases and otherwise flimsy heightand width. Considered in conjunction with the stone walls that form the ellipses ofsmaller pillars, the mind moves inevitably to an amphitheatrical effect of chanting,drumming and dancing, both people and ‘heavenly beings’ vibrating together with the51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"sacred sound. Throw in the night sky, firelight casting dancing shadows of animaltotems, the smell of roasted game and the suggestion of ritual intoxication and thewhole place starts to sound ... well ... really quite fun.Uncovered at nearby Nevali Çori and dating to a few centuries later arefragments of a limestone bowl depicting two persons with raised arms. Betweenthem, a therianthropic turtle joins in the dance, as Oliver Dietrich suggests, ‘maybereflecting the altered state of consciousness of the dancers.’ Turtles, like crocodiles,are not exactly endemic in Southeast Turkey.The sonic qualities of Neolithic temples have been gaining wider awarenessthese past few years. The bluestones of Stonehenge ‘sing’ when hit with rocks. InWestern European tombs and mounds, resonances tend to cluster around the 110–122Hertz range, the same as a baritone voice. Maltese temples – currently consideredNeolithic though very likely Palaeolithic in origin – provide similar results. Likeastronomy, a scientific understanding of sound has typically fallen outside the morehumanities-focused interpretations of ancient history. The implications of thesePalaeolithic capacities are astounding and cry out to be explored, both personally andacademically.In the last few years, fragments of human bone have been found in niches behindsome of the smaller, surrounding pillars. This opens up the intriguing possibility thatGöbekli Tepe was used as a platform for excarnation. (I also suspect thesesurrounding pillars may represent individual tribal or family groups that convened atthe site; Palaeolithic heraldry, if you will.) The preponderance of vulture imagery addsfurther weight to an excarnatory function. Excarnation is a post-mortem practice thathas been used across Central Asia since the Neolithic and even survives to themodern day in the form of Tibetan ‘sky burials.’ I depart from Dr Schmidt’s analysisthat the presence of human bones means Göbekli Tepe was the site of a death cult.Funerals are held in churches, but churches have other functions. If the enclosureswere portals to another world, principally one located above the earth, they would beexcellent locations in which to dispose of highborn members of family groups or tribes– having the aviary ambassadors of the spirit realm carry the departed back up intothe sky – but it seems to me a death cult would be associated with a lot more humanremains than the fragments so far discovered. That being said, it is entirelyreasonable to suggest one of Göbekli Tepe’s primary magical functions related tocrossing the mortem/post-mortem threshold. Deliberately smashed T-pillars arefound buried, entire enclosures are also buried. Such ritual activity has an exactparallel in Sumeria, five thousand years later. The Mosaic Temple in Uruk – itself builtover an earlier Ubaid temple – was demolished and ritually buried in the nearby52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Riemchengebäude.Despite such a lengthy gap, there are other architectural parallels. At NevaliÇori and Cayönü, just as in Sumerian Mesopotamia, sacred structures were locatedat the edge of settlements, with later additions being built on top of earlier ones. As DrHauptmann points out, ‘strikingly throughout the long course of Mesopotamianprehistory that covers a period between 6000 BC and 4500 BC from Hassuna to Halaf,it has not been possible to identify a definite ritual structure.’ What this means is that,although the time gap is quite large, there are no immediately obvious interveninglayers. We suggest that if Dr Hauptmann wishes to find them, he should both digdeeper at existing sites and rent some SCUBA gear.BEER AND NETWORK EFFECTSThe complete absence of domesticated foodstuffs at Göbekli Tepe takes on anew dimension when you realise that large scale cereal production was taking placejust over the modern day border with Syria at a place called Jerf el Ahmar in the tenthmillennium BC. Given that such a date precedes the currently-known development ofagriculture in the region, the suggestion is the site was used for the large-scalepreparation of wild, foraged grain such as rye and einkorn. No storage structures havebeen found at the earliest stages, which may indicate the facilities were used as a sortof ‘inter-tribal cooperative.’ As Willcox and Stordeur point out, Jerf el Ahmar ‘leave[s]no doubt that this was a community dedicated to the systematic production of foodfrom wild cereals. Given the plausible suggestion that barley was being cultivated, thesite opens a window onto a long period of pre-domestic agriculture. Rye was alsoharvested, its chaff used to temper mud walls.’Moving on to something much more interesting than communally baked ryebread, it appears mankind’s relationship with alcohol is a lot older than we expected. Itused to be that historians assumed wine was first created with the domestication ofgrapes, but following discoveries in Iran or wine residue in stone bowls at theNeolithic burial site of Körtik Tepe – also in Southeast Turkey – we can now see thatwine-making predates agriculture. From Dietrich: ‘It can now be safely stated thatpeople’s first interest in wild grapes in western Asia was for alcohol production,evidence for domestication only following in the fourth millennium BC.’ Dionysus:born wild on the hills and plains that are home to the ruins of a Palaeolithic star cult.Very large capacity limestone vessels, up to 160 litres, have been found at alllevels of Göbekli Tepe. Oxalate residue – which develops during the steeping,mashing and fermentation of cereals – has been found on some of them. A completescapula was found in one of them, which is reminiscent of finds in similar bowls in the53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Syrian site of Tell ‘Abr 3. The bones may well have been used for stirring and scrapingthe surface of the liquid. (Bone beer, anyone?) As no signs of habitation have beenfound at Göbekli Tepe, Dietrich suggests that the grains used in beer production mayhave been malted at nearby settlements and brought to the complex on specialoccasions, an hypothesis that aligns perfectly with the interpretation that it was anepisodic gathering place for nearby (and possibly quite distant) tribes sharing thesame cosmology.As we saw with the Boorong people, such regular gatherings provide for someinteresting network effects. Firstly, there are genetic ones in the form of arrangedexogamy. Then there are the cultural and economic ones in the form of exchanges ofinformation and practices. And finally, there may be technological ones, which iswhere Göbekli Tepe’s story may become significant for the rest of human history.Communal sites are vectors for the transmission of technology. We havealready seen that the brewing of beer most likely predates the use of grain as a foodstaple, which only really took off following the development of agriculture. Once thedomestication of wild grain had happened, it would have been at sites such as GöbekliTepe that those who had worked this process out shared it with tribal groups who hadyet to do so. Dietrich remarks, ‘[i]t is an intriguing thought that brewing and thedomestication of wheat might be interrelated.’Even more intriguing for the thesis of this book is a story told in the Sumerian‘Debate between Sheep and Grain.’ It describes the creation of domesticated livestockand plants and their delivery to mankind on a high place where the god of wild animalswas still in residence.When, upon the hill of heaven and earth, An created the Annunaki, since heneither spawned nor created Grain with them, and since in the Land he neitherfashioned the yarn of Uttu (the goddess of weaving) nor pegged out the loom forUttu – with no Sheep appearing, there were no numerous lambs, and with nogoats, there were no numerous kids, the sheep did not give birth to her twinlambs, and the goat did not give birth to her triplet kids;Upon the pure place known as Duku, Cattle and Grain were created. Before thismoment, not even the Annunaki knew what they were, or had words for them.[T]he Annunaki, the great gods, did not even know the names Grain or Sheep.There was no grain of thirty days; there was no grain of forty days; there was nograin of fifty days; there was no small grain, grain from the mountains or grainfrom the holy habitations. There was no cloth to wear; Uttu had not been born –54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"no royal turban was worn; lord Niĝir-si, the precious lord, had not been born;The god of the wild animals was still in residence, he had not been banished. Atsuch a time, people had not clothing or houses and ate wild vegetation like sheep.The god of wild animals had not gone out into the barren lands. The people ofthose days did not know about eating bread. They did not know about wearingclothes; they went about with naked limbs in the Land. Like sheep they ate grasswith their mouths and drank water from the ditches.From the Holy Mound, domestication is sent down to mankind. At thattime, at the place of the gods’ formation, in their own home, on the Holy Mound,they created Sheep and Grain. Having gathered them in the divine banquetingchamber, the Anunnaki of the Holy Mound partook of the bounty of Sheep andGrain but were not sated; the Anunnaki of the Holy Mound partook of the sweetmilk of their holy sheepfold but were not sated. For their own well-being in theholy sheepfold, they gave them to mankind as sustenance.At that time Enki spoke to Enlil: ‘Father Enlil, now Sheep and Grain havebeen created on the Holy Mound, let us send them down from the Holy Mound.’Enki and Enlil, having spoken their holy word, sent Sheep and Grain down fromthe Holy Mound.Mythology is not history, but sometimes it is the vehicle in which history travels.Mythology is the wallpaper and history is the wall. A culture as decidedly pro-urban asSumeria will necessarily have a negative view of preagricultural societies but it isextremely hard to argue that this story is anything but a cultural memory of humanity’stransition to permanent settlements.Where it becomes extremely compelling is that the transmission of grain-basedagriculture happened at a holy mound upon which were resident sky beings and fromwhich the god of the wild animals had not yet been banished. Beginning at this holymound agricultural technology was disseminated across the world.The ancient einkorn wheat, found in the hills surrounding Göbekli Tepe, justhappens to be the single genetic ancestor of every strain of wheat grown and eatenacross the earth. People gathering at a temple on a hill to worship ‘heavenly beings’were like passengers in an airport during a pandemic. Wheat, and what to do with it,spread to every corner of the land. Mankind had civilising gods who were themselvesanything but civilised.THE CULT OF THE ANGELS55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Fundamental to the exploration of this book is the question of what and howmuch may have survived across tens of millennia. If we see resonances between thespiritual practices of the tribes that convened at Göbekli Tepe but struggle to findintervening evidence, how are we to deal with this?Returning to the concept of random versus non-random distribution of stories asdescribed by Dr Oppenheimer, it is difficult to get any less random than the samestories told in the same place. The mechanism for transmission thus becomespsychic or unconscious – anathema for scientific materialism – or it becomes amatter of continuous cultural memory. It may therefore be extremely significant thatthere is an example of continuous cultural memory overlaid in the same locations thatgave us star temples on a hill, heavenly visitors and the dissemination of‘civilisational’ technology such as agriculture. And that is Yezidism.According to former Harvard lecturer and world authority on the Kurds,Merhdad Izady, large amounts of Yezidi cosmology are actually Neolithic survivals.Although the number of modern adherents is vanishingly small, such a long-lived religion has been in existence for enough time to have splintered into sufficientsubsections that making macro statements is about as accurate as making macrostatements about Christianity.It can only really be said that three branches have survived from ancient times:Yezidism, Alevism and Yârsânism. All of them, however, past and present, share afundamental belief in the existence of luminous angelic beings, numbering seven, thatprotect the universe from an equal number of dark beings who are the lords of matter.Similar to Hinduism, the cult is quite adaptive and universal, hybridising beings andphilosophies encountered through either trade or migration, such as the transmigrationof souls, emanatory creationism, Gnostic dual-ish-m and a cosmology that allows forthe appearance on earth of world teachers such as Buddha, Jesus or Mohammed. TheYezidi branch even still retains vestiges of Mithraism, which is most noticeable in itsfestival calendar and corresponding rituals to do with perambulating bulls andcommunal feasting. Izady writes, ‘[t]he Cult is fundamentally a non-Semitic religion,with an Aryan superstructure overlaying a religious foundation indigenous to theZagros.’Mentioned by Herodotus, some Syrian and Turkish adherents of Alevism stillmaintain the rite of worshipping a deity represented by a sword stuck in the ground(which, to my eyes, looks rather like a T - pillar).But it is the central Yezidi belief in Lucifer, Malak Tawus, as the world teacher56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"and creator that is most suggestive of a very long-lived antiquity. Firstly, long before itwas even a twinkle in History Channel’s eye, we have a belief in celestial civilisingbeings. Secondly, the ‘peacock angel’ is commonly represented as a bird sitting atop atotem pole. Sometimes it is a rooster. Both species are genetically south Asian andthis is something we will return to in later chapters. We return to Izady:The reverence of the Yezidis for divine manifestations in the form of a bird, thePeacock Angel, and the sacredness of roosters are just two better knownexamples. What is fascinating, but less well known, is that within 30 miles of theshrines of Lâlish are the Shanidar-Zawi Chami archaeological sites of centralKurdistan, where the archaeologist Solecki has unearthed the remains ofshrines and large bird wings, particularly those of the great bustards, dated to10,800 ± 300 years ago. The remains are indicative of a religious ritual thatinvolved birds and employed their wings, possibly as part of the priestlycostume.The representation of bird wings on gods was later to become common inMesopotamian art ... The evidence of sacrificial rites practiced at ancient ZawiChami may substantiate an indigenous precursor to modern Yezidi practice ...In light of the discoveries at Zawi Chami, the great bustard is a much morelikely bird of the Yezidi icon.Izady’s book, The Kurds: A Concise History was published several years beforeDr Schmidt’s discovery of Göbekli Tepe. As such, he was not to know that within therange of the great bustard – the male of which is the earth’s largest flying animal – theprecise same imagery of totem poles with birds, the verticality of sacred origin andeven the therianthropic half-bird/half-man imagery was to be found stretching backanother two thousand years. Izady could only pull the beginnings of Yezidism into theNeolithic because that was all that was known at the time. However, here is DrSchmidt describing the deceptive horizon between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic:I assume that since the late Palaeolithic at the latest, maybe even earlier,humans had religion. In my opinion, this is essentially indicated by evidence ofburials, as after all providing a dead person with a grave, even with burial gifts,would hardly make sense without the spiritual background of the idea of anafterlife. A religion is not necessarily connected to the idea of a netherworld, butthe existence of such an idea implicates the existence of a religion ...Thus, early Neolithic religion at about 10,000 BC, no matter its nature, israther a product of a very ancient development and not a new creation. We mayassume that since the days of old there were handed down myths or57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"mythological motifs, even if we will hardly be able to provide any real evidencefor their existence in preliterate societies, not to mention their contents.In much the same way that nearly one in two Americans believe that the worldwas created less than ten thousand years ago by an angry cloud man, while tweetingabout these same beliefs on a slave-built device connected to hundreds of satellitesorbiting the earth, it is a grievous interpretive error to assume technological changeimpacts belief systems at the same rate.So, if parts of Yezidism are a Neolithic survival, then parts of it are actually aPalaeolithic survival, regardless of the subsequent appearance of towns andagriculture.For the magician, the discovery of Göbekli Tepe at what was once believed to bethe beginning of the human cultural story opens up vast new vistas on an erapreviously considered the domain of legend, with the tantalising possibility of exploringwhich parts of modern practice may be relics from this bygone age. For more thantwo thousand years, this era has been considered the home of true wisdom, firstwisdom, the time before the Flood.58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"III ET IN LAURASIA EGOThe last 140 years of the Western occult revival owe a great deal to theacademic field of mythology and the antiquarian field of folklore. Consider for amoment the impact of Charles Godfrey Leland’s Aradia: Gospel of the Witches,Robert Graves’s The White Goddess or any of the works of Joseph Campbell. Forbetter or worse, these fields provide a psychological and ideological framework inwhich magicians locate the context, origins and meanings of particular practices.Magicians should at least shoulder some of the blame for the falling away of thisrelationship over the last thirty years but, as we saw in a preceding chapter, most of itmust land on the moribund shoulders of academia as it struggled through post-structuralism and out the other end. At the level of group discourse, occultism’sresponse to mythology’s period in the wilderness has been to ossify around older,long-abandoned mythological frameworks. The time has come to recalibrate therelationship.THE RETURN OF THE HOLLYWOOD EPICIt is possible that the age of disjointed, milquetoast mythological interpretationshas reached an inflection point. Long-abandoned as dubious preoccupations ofEmpires, the ‘grand mythological narrative’ is returning, this time (hopefully) in a farless political form.Enter The Origins of the World’s Mythologies, written by Harvard Indologist E.J. Michael Witzel and described by Wendy Doniger – she of the microscopes andtelescopes – as an ‘astonishing book.’ And it is. Returning to Doniger’s metaphor, DrWitzel offers us one heck of a telescope. He has undertaken a comparative analysis ofworldwide mythologies and mapped this comparison to archaeological and geneticdata pertaining to the spread of humans out of Africa and around the globe. The resultsare hugely significant and, crucially, provisional. To his credit, Witzel admits that hisvery long book is only the first step toward an interdisciplinary approach to mythology,not the last. New data are guaranteed to appear that will move his proposed timelines,or suggest earlier connections between cultural groups, or place mankind in a specificpart of the world at a previously-unknown date.59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Witzel’s theory is big, ambitious and new. Bold steps, taken with humility, are tobe celebrated. They are the only way to break through the conservativeincrementalism that has trapped academia in its death spiral down toward intellectualand monetary penury. They also say something profound about the origins of magicand the spirits. Occulture, like academic mythology, has a preference for lookingwithin a system for connections – such as those between Hathor and Isis – rather thanlooking at the comparison between such systems. Here is Witzel describing hiscomparative approach:The next step in the comparison is the evaluation of the actual content of thetexts. In comparative linguistics this would correspond to the studies goingbeyond single sentences to the investigation of texts, in other words, thestructure (and interpretation) of the texts concerned. In mythology this wouldamount to the description of quasi-syntactical features, such as Propp’s theoryof the 30-odd constituents of Russian folk tales. However, comparisons of wholemythologies, corresponding in linguistics to that of, say, the Latin, Greek,Sanskrit, and beyond, the Egyptian, Sumerian and Nostratic languages and soon, are missing even now. In other words, we lack truly comparative andhistorical mythology, whose parallel in linguistics has existed since the early19th century.Given that languages contain whole cosmologies, Dr Witzel’s comparativeapproach to mythology shines a brand new light on the interrelation of the gods andspirits of the western tradition. And such a light banishes the shadows of somepersistent errors in magical reasoning.Two such errors – actually both ends of the spectrum of the same error – are anover-reliance on archaeology’s limited ability to tell us things about the non-physicalworld; and conversely the complete dismissal of archaeological evidence in either thecreation of or the failure to update a magical worldview. Witzel empowerscomparative mythology, linguistics, genetics and archaeological evidence to work inconcert, using insights from one field to plug holes in another, while favouring none.Independent local emergence of transcontinental and transoceanic motifs, and inthe case of Laurasian mythology, of the complex Laurasian storyline, cannot beposited just because current archaeology does not yet indicate their existence.Absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Instead, the very existenceof Laurasian myths in the Americas is proof of a pre-Mesolithic mythologicaltradition. The limitations of a purely archaeological model for the interpretationof the spiritual world of any early culture are conspicuous.60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"12This interdisciplinary approach results in a global mythological scheme that hasa time depth western esotericism is simply not used to dealing with. Whilsttechnically beginning prior to mankind’s departure from Africa, the scheme pivots onthat first colonial expedition. And so it is there that we begin.THE PEOPLING OF THE EARTHMythology is crying out to be re-examined in the wake of what we now knowabout the peopling of the earth. When constructing grand narratives, insights derivedfrom genetic research are our best defence against falling into the bad habits of either‘stacking’ cultures in order of preference – the imperial error – or lazily relying onpsychological explanations for similarities across place and time, which lacksevidence and fails to account for non-random distribution.Given that the cells in your arms and legs are genetically identical, it isreasonable to suggest humanity has not quite got its collective head around preciselywhat our DNA is for. This does not mean we have not found it useful in other areas ofresearch, particularly in the tracing of ancient population movements.One of the purposes of my visit to Oxford mentioned in the prologue was tospeak with researchers involved in the ‘out of Africa’ genetic study. What I neededreconciling was the very good genetic evidence that every human alive today isdescended from the one African mother living between 200,000 and 100,000 years agowith the abundance of archaeological evidence that falls outside these dates, such asfirepits in Israel and the UK that are twice as old again, and so on.There are two main ways of calibrating these data:If an earlier group of colonists left Africa and subsequently completely died outthen, by definition, their existence would not show up in the blood of people stillalive today as their genetic material has not been passed down. As a result, wealso lack the DNA of the colonists to match against existing samples in thedatabase, making it all but impossible to find the presumably-much-earlierMitochondrial Eve in Africa.With each passing year, it is becoming more obvious that we were not the onlyhominid game in town. Just in the space of the last decade, Neanderthals haveprogressed from being stupid, violent, language-free apes to a species capable ofartistic abstraction in ochre painting found in Spain, pan-Mediterranean sailors,and a larger chunk of our own family tree than most of us realise.The second point will take on increasing relevance as the book progresses, but61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"for now it is important to realise that when we talk about how long a part of the worldhas been inhabited, we are really telling the story of our own bloodline, rather than thestory of the place. In the coming decades, we may expect a continuous realignment ofvery early archaeological evidence with the migration of other hominids such asHomo erectus and the Denisovans, fleshing out the story of an Ice Age world ofmysterious, sometimes competing, sometimes allying hominid species. As this bookcontends, just because we currently cannot – or will not – see it, the early human storyis a lot longer and a lot more exciting than anybody expected. The whole situation callsto mind worldwide legends of mysterious companion races that we pushed to themargins of our habitats before losing sight of them completely. It is my contention thatencounters with other hominids and/or their cultural remains may in some part bereflected in mythology. (The Oxford scientists would not be drawn on this hypothesis,obviously.)Returning to the story of our bloodline, it appears our ancestors left Africa,turned right and hugged the coast all the way down through South Asia and intoAustralia. According to research by the Bradshaw Foundation, evidence of modernhumans is found just across the mouth of the Red Sea from the Horn of Africa 90,000to 85,000 years ago. By 75,000 years ago at the latest, modern humans had alreadymade it right around the south coast of India and Sri Lanka to western Indonesia and upinto what is now modern day Japan. A few thousand years later, humans had made itinto Australia and what is now western Oceania. This is a surprisingly rapid trip.Perhaps beach jogging was our first leisure activity?Based on studies of bottlenecks in the gene pool, those first migrants numberedvery few, somewhere between 10,000 and 2,000 people. They would have brought withthem an early African language and, crucially, a mythology. At present, there is noevidence of modern humans along the presumed coastal route of South Asia betweenAfrica and the appearance of fully modern human remains in Australia by 50,000 BCE.Any such evidence is likely now under the ocean as a result of today’s significantlyhigher sea levels. The Negritos (including the Malayan Semang, Philippino Negritosand the Andamanese) are suspected as being remnants of this first exodus. Whilstthey all show genetic and linguistic intermixing with neighbouring groups, theAndamanese show the least intermixing. Dr Witzel considers this significant for hissuggestions regarding the mythology of these explorers as there are large overlapsbetween Andamanese cosmology and that of indigenous African groups.Secondary migrations subsequently occurred up into Eurasia and Europe fromSouthern and Southeast Asia at the end of an earlier ice age, between 52,000 and45,000 BCE. Colonisation of the Americas first happened up the west coast of the62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"1Pacific and then back down its east coast into South America at the range of 30,000 –20,000 years ago. (Assuming there was no trans-oceanic migration, that is. I suspectthere may have been.) Successive Amerindian migrations from central Eurasiahappened much later.It may seem counterintuitive at first but similarities between mythologiesseparated in both time and space – such as the Andamanese and African pygmies –are methodologically important in building a global scheme. Witzel again:Just as in the spread of languages, certain motifs that are seen in individualmyths and in ... mythology in general have been preserved at distant, diverseends of the world; frequently it is not the immediate neighbors that are mostclosely linked, whether in myth or in language ... [I]solated, ‘bizzare’ featuresfound in two distant areas usually are a sure hint at something old, an older, nowlost structure, myth or mytheme.Witzel describes the great civilisations of the ancient world as ‘secondarycentres of mythological innovation.’ Mythology did not originate in these centres butwas dramatically transformed by them. Rather than starting in locations such asEgypt, the Indus and Mesopotamia, places of interest to a western view of itself andmore easily interrogated by archaeology, we should chart the footsteps of ourancestors and see what is to be found there.GONDWANA, LAURASIA AND PAN-GAEAWitzel categorises the planet’s mythologies into two macro-groups; examplesof both still exist today; and one underlying group – mankind’s earliest mythology –which is reconstructed from an examination of the overlaps between the two existentgroups in much the same way as ancient languages are reconstructed. All three arediscussed below.GONDWANA MYTHOLOGY: 65,000 years old. This is the cosmology ourancestors took with them when they left Africa. These are described as ‘a forest ofstories,’ which is a collection of discrete tales pertaining to the origin of individualcreatures, how mankind first appeared, and taboos around tribal morality.Gondwana mythologies display little interest in the creation or destruction of theuniverse; indeed, probably the defining characteristic of a Gondwana mythology isthat the creation/destruction story is absent and the universe has always existedand will always exist. Modern examples of Gondwana mythologies are found inSub-Saharan Africa, Australia, New Guinea and parts of the western Pacific, allplaces of long-term isolation from other cultures and in the case of the latter two,63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"23where we very quickly arrived at on our out-of-Africa mission.LAURASIAN MYTHOLOGY: 40,000 years old. Sometime around this date,somewhere in Asia or Eurasia, mankind developed what Witzel calls ‘our firstnovel.’ Laurasian mythologies begin with the creation of the world/universe andend with its destruction. In the intervening time we find the separation of heavenand earth, Creation existing through repeated epochs, the killing of a dragon ormonster, a Golden Age and a Flood as punishment for mankind. Examples includeIndo-Aryan mythology (and thus Sumerian, Babylonian and Vedic), Eurasian andEuropean shamanism (and subsequently archaic Greek and Celtic), NorthAmerindian shamanism and North African belief (thus including Ancient Egypt).PAN-GAEAN MYTHOLOGY: Between 150,000 and 65,000 years old. This isWitzel’s reconstruction of mankind’s first mythology, emerging some time inAfrica after the appearance of modern humans. It contains a distant High God whomay or may not have created the world but is uninvolved with it, a Trickster whoteaches/creates mankind, a spirit world viewed as a well of souls and probably agiant snake whose movements across the earth create the landscape.This is a noble and ambitious exercise in examining non-random distribution.Witzel explains his methodology:In actual procedure, when carrying out the Laurasian project, we have to start bystating obvious similarities between myths, sets of myths and wholemythologies. As a matter of principle and procedure, one needs two or threeidentical or similar items, best those distant from each other in space and time,to establish a common ancestral element. Comparisons of items found only inadjacent cultures are discouraged as they may be due to borrowing, but widelydistant, remote mythologies (for example, those of Polynesia and ancient Israel,Scandinavia, or Greece or those of the Maya and Greeks) are especially useful.Pursuing these investigations, the Laurasian mythological model will graduallyemerge and take shape.We shall unpack the scheme in reverse-chronological order, beginning withLaurasia, and then address some of its shortcomings.LAURASIAN MYTHOLOGYThe implication of mythic similarity points to a common pool of motifs that musthave existed at a sufficient time depth to appear across such disparate corners of theworld. Given that both Amerindian and Eurasian mythologies share the same64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Laurasian shape, this puts its appearance somewhere between 40,000 BCE and20,000 BCE, ‘somewhere in Asia.’ Pinpointing the best case for precisely where inAsia requires the use of data points that Dr Witzel studiously avoids, which we willcome to in later chapters. As we examine the components of Laurasian mythology, themost obvious examples that occur to you will likely be Judeo-Christian ones. This isto be expected as the Western world’s dominant mythology is currently a NearEastern one. However, as we saw from the examination of the history of archaeologyand folklore, this does not point to a Near Eastern origin for the Laurasian story.Cultural prominence should not be mistaken for a point of origin. The Near Easternvariant of Laurasian mythology emerged at the comparatively late date of 3,000 BCEand thus could not have influenced the rise of the same ‘mythological novel’ we find inthe Americas.Laurasian mythology also exists in a variety of climates, putting paid to the ideathat mythology exclusively arises as a product of human interaction with the localbiosphere. (Though a coconut tree quickly becomes an oak tree as people move north,the tree remains.) Before examining the scheme in detail, I will mention that, workingto Dr Witzel’s timelines, Göbekli Tepe falls squarely into Laurasian time and space.This affords us an opportunity to analyse and counter-check its ritual function.The World EggThis is more properly considered the primordial waters/chaos/non-being-emerging-into-an-egg/hill mytheme, but that makes for an awkward subheading.Examples of this mytheme are found in Ancient Egyptian, Maori and Pacific beliefs, aswell as Indo-Aryan, Eurasian shamanic, Hindu and Greek cosmologies.Typically it entails the universe emerging from primordial waters as an egg,with half forming the sky and half forming the ground. Variants include the First Moundfound in Ancient Egypt. The egg component is still evident there, however, where thewaters of Nun are described as having no surfaces or edges and are compared to anegg.In many of its variants, the world is created from the breaking of the egg in someform, and thus overlaps with the creation of the universe from the corpse of a defeatedgiant/dragon/monster. Sometimes it is the universe emerging from the egg but thephysical realm is built of monster parts. Ymir, Pangu and Purusha are examples ofthis.Father Heaven, Mother Earth, and their separation65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The most obvious example of this mytheme is the Egyptian Geb and Nut –where the genders are reversed for reasons discussed later in the book – separatedby their children, thus letting in light and air. An identical motif is found in NewZealand, across Polynesia, in Japan and Greece.Variants include the Bible in which the Spirit of God ‘moved upon the waters’ andsubsequently created/let in Light. A close match is also found in the Popol Vuh.Typically, it is the children of this paring who are responsible for the separationof their parents and this act ushers in the next phase in Creation as well as commonly‘timestamping’ the children to an era before the ascendant gods of that particularculture. As seen below.Descending generations of deities and epochsIn a Laurasian scheme, the gods involved in Creation are ‘under-worshipped’ intheir host cultures. Even worse, they are regularly depicted as monsters that need tobe slain, such as the characterisation by the upstart Olympian gods of the Titans orsome of the Hindu devas in Vedic and post-Vedic cosmology.The classic example of this is the Sumerian depiction of Tiamat, her childrenand their confusing family tree of murder and intermarriage stretching over fourgenerations. Most commonly we find associated with the story of killing the leader ofthe previous gods the notion that there are four specific ages, each increasinglydegenerate. (We are now in the Kali Yuga, for instance.)An exception to the degeneration of successive ages is found with the Puebloand Mesoamericans, suggesting a change in the ‘opinion’ of aeonics among Laurasiancultures from positive to negative sometime between 20,000 BCE – when theAmericas were presumably first colonised – and 4,000 BCE – when we first spy theaeonic model again in the archaeological record. A change in politics or climate, suchas a worldwide flood, may have contributed to this. Witzel on the Maya system:The present (fifth) phase of the universe began when the dawn of the fifth sunappeared, after the previous Four Suns had failed. In these ‘trial creations’ thegods had unsuccessfully tried to create the world, light and human beings. TheFour Suns correspond, sometimes even in name, to the Four Ages or fourgenerations of the Indian, Near Eastern and Greek mythologies. The Navajoname their eras with the same colors as the western Eurasians: the Greek gold,silver, bronze and iron ages become their gold, silver, red and black ages. Themyth is also found in South America, with the Incas.66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The original ‘positive’ view of Laurasian aeonics is discerned by the progressiveimprovement of ‘world governance’ in most of its mythologies: the universe is inchaos, then it is run by monsters, then it is run by local cultural heroes (whonevertheless had dramatic or tragic lives), then it is run by humans. The notion of‘falling away’ from a perfect state is presumably a later addition and probably arose inconjunction with mythemes pertaining to royal bloodlines and a Golden Age; bothhighly effective forms of local political propaganda.The Trickster/Demiurge who brings civilisationIt has long been proposed that tricksters or demiurges represent ‘leftover gods’from a previous cultural regime. If there is any accuracy to Dr Witzel’s tripartitescheme then this may be simultaneously true and false. There is good evidence thatthe ‘civilising trickster’ is found in our earliest, Pan-Gaean level. Nevertheless, theinsertion of a Demiurge into ‘our first novel’ suggests this new way of describingreality, the shamanic/chieftain description, had to solve the problem of what to do withall these leftover creators and creatrixes – the serpent, especially – contained withinthe underlying Gondwana stories. It is my strong suspicion that our changing opinionof the serpent over the last few tens of thousands of years is down to such a‘demiurgification.’ Prometheus was a Titan, predating the Olympians, and the Serpentin Eden is a patently archaic mytheme. Look how it turned out for them.Killing the DragonOne of the cornerstone mythemes of the Laurasian storyline is the killing of adragon or other enormous monster by a culture hero. Often it parallels or interrelateswith the ‘World Egg’ mytheme in instances where the corpse of the dragon is used toconstruct the physical universe. Given that the dragon or giant snake is evidenced atmuch earlier levels than the emergence of Laurasian mythology, it is tempting to drawthe conclusion that these stories represent the rewriting of cultural origins by a newpower elite: the shaman, the chieftain, etc.Examples of this mytheme include Marduk’s destruction of Tiamat, a deityseveral generations older than himself; Leviathan, a more modern iteration of thesame Near Eastern dragon story; and Indra’s destruction of Vritra, ‘firstborn of theserpents,’ which releases all the world’s water. The flood/water motif more often thannot accompanies the dragon mytheme. Egypt, Greece, Northern Europe, China,Polynesia and South America – completing the Laurasian ‘footprint’ – all containexamples of this same story type.A Golden Age67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The inevitable next chapter in a ‘novel’ containing progressive aeons is a GoldenAge where the gods lived with mankind, which is then followed by the withdrawal ofthe gods and the stewardship of the earth by half-human, half-divine beings. Themajority of these mythemes are associated with the origins of noble or royalbloodlines and likely emerged during a time of social stratification. One does not needto look too hard for examples. Egypt, Sumeria, Vedic civilisation, China, Greece,Mesoamerica and South America. A lot of ‘alternative history’ involves zeroing in onone example, the Book of Enoch for instance, taking it literally and then makingambitious claims about the extraterrestrial origin of specific modern families orcultural groups.Technically, nothing prevents a researcher from following the hypothesis thatthis civilising event literally happened and was caused by physical beings. However,such an hypothesis must be bound by the same rules of evidence as any other. It also,by definition, must examine the original telling of the story of our first civilising period,rather than arbitrarily selecting much later ones. Given that the homeland of Laurasianmythology still eludes us, such hypotheses are currently very tenuous.A stronger, ‘placeholder’ hypothesis would be that this mytheme is a culturalmemory of a moment of increased societal complexity involving the emergence of anew class of rulers taking their authority from the stories of an equally-newshamanic/priestly class, who may have been intermediaries for a new class of spiritsor gods appearing some time around 40,000 years ago.The FloodIf Dr Witzel’s timelines are even slightly accurate, then Laurasian cultures had astory of a worldwide flood, typically interpreted as divine punishment for man’s hubris,for tens of thousands of years before experiencing a worldwide flood at the end of thelast Ice Age. Witzel’s suggestion that these two events are entirely unrelated will bechallenged below and explored in much greater detail in subsequent chapters. Even ifthe suggestion is accurate, and worldwide flood stories predate the end of the Ice Age,then going through just such an event would have been seen by the cultures whoexperienced it as typologically familiar. Put another way, having a very old story abouta worldwide flood does not preclude the subsequent experience of just such a floodfrom surviving in your stories.The ApocalypseThe Laurasian novel ends with one heck of a boss fight. In contrast to the‘eternalism’ more commonly found in Gondwana mythologies, Laurasian mythologies68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"not only have a beginning but will also someday end with the catastrophic destructionof the world.GONDWANA MYTHOLOGYComplex religion must have existed and been brought to Australia by 50,000BCE at the very latest. The independent creation of Australian and African motifs canbe excluded on the basis of the huge overlap between the two groups. The firstAustralian arrived with at least a few concepts they brought with them from home.Clearly some of the overlapping mythemes give us our starting point for constructingGondwana mythology at this time depth.What is important to remember is that Witzel’s categorisation is not anevolutionary one. Gondwana stories are older than Laurasian ones but they stillcontinue to this day in worldviews found in Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and parts ofPapua New Guinea, among other places. Cultures do not graduate from one collectionof stories to another like cabin classes on an airplane.From a magical perspective, the defining difference between Laurasia andGondwana is that the former has a strong emphasis on the power of the word asopposed to the latter’s stress on physical objects such as fetishes. This correlates todiffering ontological emphases. Laurasian mythology seeks to explain the origin of athing, as the knowledge of something’s origin or name confers power over it. It is wordand action that gives the Laurasian sorcerer his or her power. The role of a mediatingobject, such as a poppet, is less important. The prominence of power objects inGondwanan magic reflects the lack of distinction between the profane and the spiritual.All of human existence is integrated into myth. Quoting Maurice Leenhardt’sdescription of the Melanesian approach to myth, Witzel writes, ‘[t]he Melanesianprojects himself into this world. He does not distinguish between reality and his ownpsychic life, between his self and the world. He plays a quasi-cosmic role.’ Less careis given to the wording of an enchantment than is given to the quality of the powerobject used.Once again, it is tempting to see the emergence of a new political class in thischange of magical emphasis. To shift cosmic power from control of sacred objects tothe naming and describing of things shifts power from the magical-asset rich to thelexicographers.The most common components of Gondwana’s ‘forest of stories,’ as opposed toLaurasia’s ‘novel’ include the following.69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"123456CONTINUOUS CREATION. Gondwana mythologies contain numerous discretestories of the origins of things, animals and most especially humans. Howeverthese most commonly take place on a canvas of a pre-existing, eternal universe.There is also no final destruction of the world. Gondwana’s principal ontologicalconcern is the shaping of the earth in such a way that makes human life possible.Typically this is seen in the activities of the trickster.TOTEMIC ORIGINS OF MANKIND. In most Gondwana mythologies, mankindhas its origin in a tree. Variants include a tree stump or split bamboo. Lesscommonly this is a rock or clay. (Both motifs, and particularly the tree, continuedinto Laurasian mythology. They can be found in the Bible, the Eddas, etc. Continuityof ‘tree burial’ is also seen in the Osiris myth.)A DISTANT HIGH GOD. If some form of creation happened, it was instigated by adistant high god who has subsequently removed himself from heaven and is nolonger worshipped, nor does he respond to worship.FULLY DEVELOPED POLYTHEISM. The deities that do receive worship arelocal, nature spirits as well as ancestors.A CIVILISING TRICKSTER. Occasionally the trickster is the same as the distanthigh god. More commonly it is his son or emissary who descends and teachescultural technology to mankind. Often, mankind displays hubris and is punished bya flood.THE (RAINBOW) SERPENT. Sometimes the high god takes the form of a giantserpent and creates the earth by the movements of his body, such as in Melanesia.Other times the serpent is a separate being. The most famous example of this isthe Australian Aboriginal Rainbow Serpent, a concept also found in SouthernAfrica, Iran, India, Burma and South America. In Arnhem Land, the RainbowSerpent is the supreme creatrix. She is represented as the Milky Way in the nightsky and carries the ancestors of the Aborigines in her belly. However it is clearlystated that the sky and earth already existed.On that last point, it is interesting that the oldest archaeological evidence of ritualever found on earth was discovered in Botswana by University of Oslo researchers.Offerings of arrow tips and similar objects, dedicated to a giant python whose bodymovements shaped the land have been found at a time depth of 70,000 years ago. Thisstrikes me as something of a smoking gun for the Gondwana hypothesis.PAN-GAEAN MYTHOLOGY70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"12Pan-Gaean mythology is Witzel’s tentative reconstruction of what mankind’sfirst cosmology may have been. Obviously there are no extant examples of thesebeliefs or languages. However the methodology is sound and the insights are useful inthe potential repositioning of western magic. The reconstruction is less arbitrary thanit might initially appear. Just as Laurasian mythologies retain a certain amount ofGondwana motifs, a similar overlapping approach can be used to posit Pan-Gaea.Most widespread among the earliest cosmologies is the notion of a high goddeparting a pre-existing earth for the heavens. At some stage he (most often he ratherthan she) sends down a trickster emissary to teach culture and hunting to mankind.There is typically some story of humans violating a taboo and triggering punishment. A‘well of souls’ where humans come from and return to appears in evidence. I alsosuspect based on the Botswana research and the widespread appearance of theRainbow Serpent that a large snake either was the high god or is in some wayassociated with him. Local spirits and the worship of stones and unusual features inthe terrain that are occupied by said spirits also appear likely.Sacrifice is prominent in hunter gatherer society and the necessity of killing isprobably reflected in the destruction of the dragon/monster and the carving up of itscorpse to create the world: without this act of violence there is nothing. Dr Witzelsuggests that this belief may be the ultimate origin for the much later desire to build instone. Regardless of their astronomical alignments, stone circles are in some sense amap of a world. To build one may well be a replaying of the carving up of a primordialmonster. Given the prevalence of stone worship at a very early age, this is hugelyintriguing.SHORTCOMINGS IN THE THESISBeing the first to say something is very often more trouble than it is worth. To DrWitzel’s credit, he admits his thesis will certainly be subject to modification andelaboration as more information comes to light. For the purposes of our researchthere are some notable shortcomings.An underemphasis on star lore and navigation which are found in abundance in theGondwana mythologies of Australia. The persistence of specific asterisms throughhistory is one of the through lines of this book and broadly supports Witzel’s thesis.Staying firmly within the canon of what are acceptable data in mainstreamacademia. For instance there is no mention of complex megalithic sites that falloutside the broad Gondwana/Laurasia grouping, such as Gunung Padang inIndonesia. A professional Indologist is expected to say ‘we don’t know where the71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"34567Laurasian homeland is but it’s in the Nostratic area’ without evidence.‘That’s a story for another time’ is invoked when the evidence points in a directionthat would make mainstream academia uncomfortable. An example would be theappearance of Gondwana motifs in South America much earlier than the datescurrently accepted for the population of the continent. (These are motifs that couldonly have got there via trans-Pacific navigation.)Witzel refers to flood myths as ‘incidental’ and spread in a ‘quasi-universal’ way,which is an academic way of sidestepping the very likely situation that somemyths may encode some real events. This dismissal is glaring becausedetractors could similarly refer to the appearance of his own Laurasian ‘story line’as ‘quasi-universal’ or ‘incidental.’ We will examine in detail the distribution offlood motifs around the world. They appear with the highest density in areas thatwere subject to the greatest amount of land loss at the end of the Ice Age and thelowest density in areas that lost the least land. That non-random distributionrequires explanation.Witzel won’t be drawn on whether some of the flood myths may relate to an actualevent but is happy to suggest that the concept of a primordial ocean surroundingthe land is a likely cosmology to emerge as colonists left Africa and spent a fewthousand years walking along the coast of South Asia into Australia. This isn’t tosuggest his hypothesis of the primordial ocean is not keenly observed. It is. Halfthe entire universe for our ancestral colonists would have been ocean; a source offood, wonder, and a direction from which they could be sure they would not besubject to predation, unlike the grasslands and thick jungle on the other side of thesand. Witzel appears to choose the motifs that may have at least some literalorigin based on personal preference.The perhaps understandable inability to interpret the simultaneous development ofartistic and spiritual concepts at 40,000 BCE all around the world without recourseto a spirit model or even a consciousness one. Witzel’s overlay of themythological motifs of the world with the archaeological evidence of this greatcultural flowering highlights its strangeness in a way that is hard to ignore. So wewill not.The suggestion that Gondwana mythologies aren’t interested in the creation of theworld needs to be challenged in some scenarios. For instance, the Melanesiangods created the islands they settled rather than the whole universe. But theMelanesians did arrive there after the Flood. This means not only is the storyliterally true in some sense, it hints at the possibility that the act of Creation72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"happened elsewhere. I suspect Laurasian mythology emerged in Island SoutheastAsia, as we shall see, so the creation of the islands should be seen as a separateevent to the creation of the universe. It is important to note that challenging this‘hard line’ does not invalidate the Laurasia/Gondwana grouping and couldconceivably be used to locate the Gondwana ‘origins’ for mankind’s first concernwith the beginnings of the universe.For all of these shortcomings I forgive him entirely. Firstly, because the theory isdelivered with rigour and humility. Secondly, the broad strokes appear not only correctbut hugely, hugely useful to the further investigations of the origins of western magic.SHAMANISM THROUGH TIMEAs so many others have pointed out, shamanism, like linguistics (discussed inthe next chapter), struggles under an historiographic challenge. The first region to bestudied, Central Eurasia, has been used as the template by which others aremeasured. When working to timescales that cover tens of millennia and across thegeography of the whole planet, this can be misleading.Due in large part to the work of Mircea Eliade, we think of ‘shamanism’ asoriginating or templating in the area of the world that gave us the term. While historyhas been kind to Eliade’s analysis of Siberian shamanism, his work on African andAustralian traditions has not held up quite so well, and is even racially problematic. Heconsidered the Australian versions to be ‘debased,’ for instance.Based on the genetic and linguistic evidence that has subsequently come to light,we must reverse Eliade’s directionality. Shamanism, in the academic sense, refers toindigenous spirit traditions tied to particular cultures and places. The overlappingbeliefs and practices – of which there are many – moved out of Africa and into SouthAsia and Australia before human migration took them north into Eurasia. Thus we cansee the retention of some Gondwana layers – such as cave initiation and shamanicdancing – but also the development of some specifically Laurasian techniques thatcame later – such as the use of drumming in association with the shamanic dancing.Indeed, Witzel suggests that Laurasia’s ‘novelistic form’ may have been ashamanic performative device to encourage memory retention of a culture’s ‘forest ofstories.’ A linear plot line is easier to recall and, crucially, retransmit with minimalchange, than a non-linear one. The precision alignment of stone circles found rightacross the Laurasian footprint may represent underexamined evidence of this ‘secretknowledge’ that accompanied the rise of these new, novelising shamans. The processof incorporating disparate Gondwana star lore into a coherent system that could be73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"predicted, measured and controlled by a new social class at the same time that anidentical process was happening to the ‘forest of stories’ is too compelling to ignore.Perhaps most interestingly, overlaying shamanic studies on aLaurasia/Gondwana framework provides insight into which magical techniques maybe the longest lived. Extant shamanic traditions, such as those of the San, that occur inthe parts of Africa that probably gave rise to the first modern humans, have techniquesfor moving ‘heat’/energy up the spine and out through the head. This flow issymbolised as a serpent, within a culture that also has a rainbow serpent that aidsshamans with shamanic flight. The same motif recurs obviously in India andAustralia. You will recall it is also evident in the statues found near Göbekli Tepe and inthe uraeus headdress of the Pharaohs, among many other examples. Here we likelysee a supremely ancient process of manipulating energy upward and out, then thesubsequent journeying thanks to the assistance of an animal spirit such as a snake ora bird. By the time this practice reaches Siberia the snake has become the world tree(the combination of both echoes through Genesis and into Kabbalah) but thedirectionality is the same.Examining these similarities in light of the archaeological evidence of mankind’searliest ritual being devoted to a giant snake should have us all looking at the contentsof our grimoires and magical cosmologies in a new light.THE SPIRIT INTERPRETATIONThis could almost belong as another shortcoming in the thesis were it not a nearuniversal and entirely expected blind spot found across the modern academicspectrum. Witzel notes that the emergence of the Laurasian storyline broadlycoincides with the so-called ‘Palaeolithic Renaissance’ in both time and space. Whileit is tempting to completely conflate the two, the fact remains that the Renaissancealso occurred in Gondwana cultures, particularly those of Northern and EasternAustralia, home to some of the most vivid and compelling cave art on the planet.The simultaneous, dramatic changes in symbolic thinking in differing culturesand local biospheres are difficult to reconcile in models that exclusively rely onmaterialist explanations. Dietary changes or environmental pressure cannot beposited as the Renaissance occurred across diverse climates. A specialist readershipsuch as this one requires an additional interpretation, if not explanation.Based on eminent mycologist Gastón Guzmán’s analysis of the worldwidedistribution of psilocybe mushrooms, it is interesting to note that their tropical andsubtropical distribution overlays with South East Asia, New Guinea, Northern and74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Eastern Australia, New Zealand as well as Central America, the northern parts ofSouth America and Central Europe. (The New Guinea/East Australia/New Zealandvariants are very closely related to the Mexican ones, I note in passing.) Crucially forany attempt to fold entheogenic theory into the Pan-Gaea/Gondwana/Laurasiaparadigm, the fungus is almost entirely absent from the parts of Africa believed to firstgive rise to modern humans but is found in high concentrations in the areas ourcolonising ancestors quickly moved to, in the case of South East Asia/NewGuinea/Australia, and neatly overlays with examples of the Palaeolithic Renaissance,both in Gondwana and Laurasia cultures. Thus while the origin or ‘reason’ for the firstemergence of mankind’s spiritual impulse, the African Pan-Gaea cosmology,continues to elude us, it may be that we are seeing here the evidence for an encounterwith a new class of spirits or consciousness effects, triggered by the colonists’encounters with the psilocybin molecule, resulting in similar spiritual and artisticresponses within different cultures.Given that we are talking about fungi and cultures with perishable artefacts at atime depth of 40,000 years, it is not clear what archaeological evidence we would everexpect to prove or disprove this hypothesis, although there are numerous depictions ofmushrooms or humans with mushroom hands, etc. in later cave art, and indeed atGöbekli Tepe. It may be that mushroom encounter rates rose with the development offorest burn off as a strategy for growing the numbers of prey animals. This form ofanimal population management was still being practiced by the Australian Aboriginesas late as last century. More animals, more dung, more mushrooms. (Certaingeologists suggest that all grasslands are manmade. But for our purposes, there is noway to distinguish manmade burn offs from fires caused by lightning strikes.)Western magic’s ‘immortality tech’ is almost entirely Laurasian: the use ofwords and ritual, the ascent or reascent into heaven, the mythological context of aprior age of wisdom teachers who have passed the techniques down to us, the tree oflife and an eschatological milieu. While Laurasia may be the ‘containing narrative’ forWestern magic, many of its spirits are at least Gondwanan and potentially Pan-Gaean. You can even make the case – and I do – that ‘true’ Western magic, devoid ofits much, much later onboarding of Neoplatonism, is a practical application of a Pan-Gaean world-view: God may exist but its existence is materially irrelevant; theTrickster/Devil is the gatekeeper and lord of culture; and it is recourse to local spiritsand the dead by way of sacrifice that is the most commonly performed action.The witch is a very old woman and she has been on a long, long walk.DIGGING IN THE WRONG PLACE75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"12345This book tells the story of at least one advanced culture that existed prior to theend of the Ice Age, and the survival of some of its cultural practices and spirits downinto the practice of western magic in the twenty first century, albeit in dramaticallydifferent outerwear. So it is an ‘alternate history’ book, which puts it in, shall we say,mixed company?One of the great gifts of the Laurasian model is that it provides a countercheck oflinguistic, genetic and archaeological evidence to some of the bolder claims ofalternate history. It is worth highlighting some of these claims so you can see howwheat is separated from chaff.Looking for Noah’s Ark. Noah is a recent example of a much older flood myth,inherited by Near Eastern cultures. Why then, would we expect to find a 3,000 yearold boat on a hill when the original story is at least 10,000 years old? (Theconstruction of ritual boats, on the other hand, is attested to all across theLaurasian footprint.)Plato’s Atlantis. A variant of the above error, with the addition of mistakingtechnological complexity for cultural complexity because that is what we value inthe west. Atlantis is an example of a retained memory of earlier cultures, to besure, and very possibly a retained memory of the first Laurasian culture.The location of the Garden of Eden. Eden is a Near Eastern variant of Laurasia’s‘Golden Age’ motif. The tree, snake and immortality fruit make that pretty clear.Again we face the problem of using as a map the literal description of a tumbleddown, 20,000 year old story that was first told a long way from Judea.The Nephilim and the Book of Enoch. Another example of a retelling of the mucholder Laurasian concept of the descent of spirit beings and an age of half-human,half-divine rulers and culture heroes. If it happened in any physical way, ithappened tens of millennia prior to the story of Enoch.Similarities between Mesoamerica and Egypt. There are certainly manysimilarities between these two regions. Typically this is expressed as ‘how couldthis be when they are separated by so much time and distance? Ergo aliens.’ Thesimilarities are entirely predicted in the Laurasian model, whereby it wasLaurasian cultures who colonised both areas between 30,000 and 10,000 yearsago, and retained variants of the same motifs. Dynastic Egypt and Mesoamerica(may have) had no contact, but wind the clock back far enough and thetransmission vector becomes clear.76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"6789Literal interpretations of Moses. These are typically accompanied by a confuseddescription of the Amarna Period of Ancient Egypt, with Akhenaten inventingmonotheism (sometimes because of aliens), and then something to do withswamps, chariots, king tides and a volcano. But Moses is a lawgiver type, alongwith Manu, Menes, etc and the ‘baby in the reeds’ storyline is attested in Laurasianmythology as part of either the Culture Hero, Flood or Golden Age motifs. (It mayactually be Gondwanan when you consider the Milky Way as the divineriver/mother as found in Australia.) In any case, Akhenaten did not inventmonotheism. He was not even a monotheist.OOPARTs. Out Of Place Artefacts, such as those collected by Klaus Dona andMichael Cremo. A lot of these actually fall within my scheme of significantly morecomplex cultures existing before the end of the Ice Age. Over the next few years,these OOPARTs may revert to being ARTs. Some of the artefacts, particularlythose in the Americas, with dates of 150,000 – 200,000 years or more can beinterpreted as evidence of the complexity of other hominins, or evidence of earlier,ultimately unsuccessful, colonists, both of which are predicted in my thesis. (Andsome of them, frankly, may be evidence of full-blown extradimensional visitationmore than a million years ago. Much of their evidence is hugely intriguing.)The Annunaki. This topic will be dealt with at length later in the book but it issufficient to say that, rather than aliens arriving in nuclear powered rocket ships tocreate mankind to mine gold to save the atmosphere of their home planet, a moresatisfying interpretation is that the Sumerians had the most vivid example of theGolden Age/Era of Demi-Gods motif out of anywhere in the Laurasian footprint.Else you have to explain why these are dozens of similar motifs around the worldthat resemble an extraterrestrial event that ‘really happened’ in one specific part ofit.Egyptians in America, Australia, etc. Sure, why not? Nothing but an improvedunderstanding of ancient maritime technology and the loosening bonds ofacademic timidity prevent the suggestion that trans-oceanic trade or explorationwas undertaken by Dynastic Egypt. However the commencement of DynasticEgypt is fairly well corroborated around 3,500 BCE, which is vastly too late to havecaused a cultural transfer to or from the Americas/Australasia. (Ancient Egyptianculture extends much further back than Dynastic Egypt, of course.)DIGGING IN THE RIGHT PLACE?From a magical perspective, one of Dr Witzel’s more useful classifications is77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"what he calls ‘grandfather stories’ and ‘grandmother stories.’ Grandfather stories arethe ‘official’ cosmologies that emerged with the rise of the Laurasian shaman/priestlyclass. It is the formation of the sanctioned belief system with its kingly stamp ofapproval. Grandmother stories are the survival of earlier, Gondwanan motifs in theform of folklore, fairy tales and children’s bedtime stories. This is similar to ProfessorTolkien’s description of fairy tales as ‘the furniture in the nursery’: The furniture beginsits life in the dining room or the bedroom, then it gets old and is replaced withsomething newer. The old furniture is relegated to the nursery, given to children tobatter, and is ignored or forgotten by the ‘official’ world of the adults. But it was onceofficial, sanctioned, even prominent.Witzel uses as an example of a grandmother tale the widely told children’s storythat babies are delivered by a stork. In Germany, the stork story begins with the birdpicking the baby up from what is effectively a ‘well of souls.’ This exact same motif infound in African Gondwana cultures and is likely Pan-Gaean in origin.When looking for magical survivals through grandmother tales it is worthobserving that folk magic or ‘women’s magic’ retains the emphasis on fetishes andphysical objects over the emphasis on correct words as found in grandfather tales.The pivot of this book’s content away from an examination of Palaeolithic star lore toan examination of the continuity of spirits and magical practices in the west emergedfrom a discussion with Jake Stratton-Kent, author of Geosophia and The Testament ofCyprian the Mage. Given the presumed female origins of goetia in Archaic Greece,and its emphasis on trafficking with the dead, then the ‘grandmother tale’ interpretationposits the intriguing possibility that, far from reaching the end of the ‘goetic hallway’ inArchaic Greece and being unable to go any further, we have instead found a doorway,opened it and spied a much, much longer corridor beyond. The practical implicationsof such a possibility are profound.Somewhere in between Africa and South America, taking the long way around,mankind’s spirituality transformed from a ‘forest of stories’ to our ‘first novel’ and thekey components of the western magical tradition began. This happened at a time afterthe first colonisation of Australia and in a place necessarily north of it.Perhaps not too far north?78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"IVArchaeology isn’t a science. It’s a vendetta.Sir Mortimer WheelerISLAND OFDRAGONSThe further back in time we travel, the fewer the archaeological data points andthe greater the desire to connect what little of them remain into parent-childrelationships. It is quite clear that the gods of both Egypt and Sumeria are present atGöbekli Tepe, albeit in atavistic form. However, it does not necessarily follow thatthose tribes who buried the last enclosure immediately wandered south and foundedtwo of the three great civilisations of antiquity. Mistaking resonance for directconnection has trapped many a magician in the garden maze of Choronzon’s summerpalace. The Laurasian model described in the previous chapter is our best interpretiveframework for exploring these correlations.When dealing specifically with physical evidence, it is essential to recognisejust how rare these data points are and to realise that they hint at a much larger worldof which we only have a fragment, then seek to build out a new, evidence-based worldfrom this knowledge. Otherwise, you are a farmer who discovers a Roman coin in afield in Somerset and declares that the empire began right here by your apple trees.More than any other error – and there are so very many to choose from – this isthe mistake that has led most Atlantologists into madness and ridicule. The lastcentury has shown that mankind indeed survived through a worldwide cataclysmwhen an area the size of Europe and China combined sank beneath the ocean. But atthe moment there seem to be more lost continents than there are Starbucks. Thecause of this error is understandable. As Dr Oppenheimer writes in Eden in the East:When breakthroughs like cereal farming, pottery and bronze making occur atthe same time in widely separate regions, the usual explanation is that thesediscoveries were independent. This may seem a weak argument but foracademics it is much safer to say this, rather than risk ridicule by having toprove how the inventions were transmitted over great distances. Theoretically,both points of view have an obligation of proof. The alternative hypothesis for the79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Neolithic Revolution – and one which seems more plausible than theindependent origins implied by the archaeological record – is that farmingtechnology was invented in one cultural region over a long period; knowledge ofthe innovation then spread to other continents by sea and land routes.So much for mainstream academia. The current state of affairs in independentor alternative research, populated with ridicule and shysters, is just as bad, if notworse.This bifurcation into ‘aliens’ in the alternative camp and ‘nothing happened,move along’ in the mainstream camp was not always so. In fact, for the vast majorityof western history, it was taken as fact that civilisation predated a worldwide sea-floodand was probably restarted by its few survivors. As the historicity of this state ofaffairs reemerges into the light, we learn that this notion – in all likelihood a culturalmemory – was one of the babies thrown out with the bathwater of biblicalCreationism. In one of the scientific method’s first clashes with the incumbent priestlyclass, the notion of a worldwide flood, Noah’s Flood, was dismissed as unscientificand so any civilisation destroyed by said flood must also be balderdash. This was anecessary casualty on the way to dethroning Creationism. It may have taken ahundred years, but geology is finally recovering from its combat wounds.Along with geology’s recovery has come the emergence of genetics as a meansof tracking ancient population movements, and advances in linguistics as a means oftracking their complexity. After two millennia of mistaking mythology for history andfollowing echoes of echoes of echoes of stories to points all over the planet, hoping thatX marks the spot, we have never been in a better position to generate facts upon whichwe can overlay interpretations.A perfect storm of prejudices and personal predilections has trapped the story ofthe Flood, and who it affected, for a long time. Atlantis is not Thera. Atlantis is not themarshlands near Valencia. Atlantis is not the Bimini Road. Atlantis is not thesubmerged harbour of Alexandria. Atlantis is a flood story, one of many. And floodstories turn out to have a decidedly nonrandom distribution.The continent with the least flood stories is Africa, which just so happens to bethe continent that suffered the least land loss at the end of the Ice Age. The area of theworld with the most flood stories is Island Southeast Asia, home to more than half ofall flood legends, which just so happens to be the part of the world that suffered themost land loss at the end of the Ice Age.As to the assumption that islanders have more experience with sea floods and80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"are thus bound to have more stories about them, this explanation is unsatisfactory andfrankly racist. It assumes a fisherman in the Bismarck Archipelago cannot distinguishbetween a global cataclysm and the Easter tides. But just as with the Hawaiians andtheir words for rain, or the Eskimos and their words for snow, a Chuukese villager willforget more about the ocean after a night out on sakau than you or I will ever know inour lifetime. The human mind cannot see colours it does not have words for. Theremay be considerable accuracy in such a volume of flood stories, if we have the wordsto see them.AND DID THOSE FEET?We will return to flood stories in the next chapter. In order to determine whetherany of them constitute cultural memories, we must first examine what actuallyhappened, and to whom.There are some very specific reasons as to why the history of Island SoutheastAsia and the nations of the Pacific are so little known. Firstly, these places are a longway from London and Amsterdam, two of the main trading centres that reincorporatedthese areas back into a global economy. Secondly, by the time it came to examiningtheir stories, much of the singular narrative of ‘world history’ was already written andso the evidence was shoehorned into a structure it simply did not fit, like a wickedstepsister’s foot squeezing into a glass slipper. That is how we have ended up with thesituation of tenured academics saying that the largest humans on earth – thePolynesians – descended from the probably the smallest – the Taiwanese – in amatter of a few centuries.To suggest that this may have been wrong was to suggest that the story of EastAsia was wrong, which was to suggest that the story of Western Asia and Europe andAfrica was wrong. Picking up a different metaphor, the jigsaw of history was completebut for one piece, the Pacific, which did not fit in the last remaining place. Better tosmash it in and hope nobody noticed than admit the whole puzzle needs starting over.Thus, the safest way forward is to layer data from the hard sciences on top ofeach other and look for where they pile the highest, and only then invite interpretationsof our unusual jigsaw piece from the Humanities end of the spectrum.GEOLOGYThe area of the earth that lost the most amount of land following the threeseparate sea level rises at the end of the Ice Age was Island South East Asia.Geologically, this entire region is now known as the Sunda Shelf, a formation of81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"fig. 5comparatively shallow seas off the Malay Peninsula and around Sumatra, Java andBorneo, making up part of the Asian continental shelf.Looking east from Sundaland, there was a small, island-strewn ocean, housingSulawesi, Timor and others, before the giant, connected continent of Australia andNew Guinea, called the Sahul Shelf.Sundaland and the Sahul ShelfBetween the last glacial maximum and the end of the Ice Age, it lost more thanhalf its total land, an area greater than modern day India. Before then, it would havebeen a rather idyllic place, consisting largely of flat, grassy plains, sheltered rivervalleys and numerous pine forests. We think of the area now as warm, humid andtropical but it was only the northern half of Borneo that was ‘everwet.’Perhaps significantly for any hypothetical development of an Ice Age culture,there were no large land predators – such as sabre-tooth tigers – for the early humansto contend with.The sea between Sundaland and the Sahul Shelf was by no means a barrier. It82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"may well have been something of a Palaeolithic Aegean. Evidence of fishing andaquaculture dating back thirty thousand years has been found as far out as theBismarck Archipelago. On Timor, one of the islands in this sea, a beautiful, 35,000year old carved bone spear point was found. Sue O’Connor, of the Australian NationalUniversity, noted that its notches are almost identical to 90,000 year old spear pointsfound in Africa, perhaps giving us an even earlier date for the beginnings of theGondwana mythological scheme (or at least some cultural continuity forward fromPan-Gaea into Gondwana). Decorated spear points are a little like Turkish startemples, their rarity is not an indication of their uniqueness. Both require a culture inwhich to evolve.GENETICSThe length of time modern humans have existed in a temperate, largelypredator-free environment that is now mostly lost beneath the ocean is highlysignificant in determining when and where Ice Age cultures may have developedcomplexity. Overlaying these two data instantly removes most of the more ambitioussuggestions for the location of a so-called lost continent. But the insights afforded us bygenetics do not stop with the peopling of the earth we saw in the last chapter. Far fromit.Returning to the metaphor of modern humans not being the only game in town,Sundaland was a veritable casino of different games. Out of anywhere on Earth, IslandSouth East Asia is emerging as the place with the highest density and greatest varietyof hominins. Most famously, we have Homo floresiensis, the ‘Indonesian hobbit’ withwhom we shared the landscape for at least thirty thousand years. Its origins areultimately unknown, but it is currently suggested that it evolved from an even earliercolonial expedition from Africa and our shared ancestor may be more than two millionyears old. Perhaps every ex-Africa group turns right and keeps the ocean on their rightuntil they run out of land?A more recently discovered hominin, the Denisovan – so named for the Siberiancave in which the first finger bone of the species, 50,000 years old, was discovered –was also a contemporaneous inhabitant of Sundaland with Homo sapiens. In fact, thehighest levels of Denisovan genetic admixture have been found in blood samples inIsland South East Asia and Oceania, demonstrating that we not only lived in the samevanished continental area, but also had sexual contact.According to Mark Stoneking, professor at the Department of EvolutionaryGenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, ‘the fact thatDenisovan DNA can be detected in some but not other original inhabitant populations83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"living in Southeast Asia today shows that numerous populations with and withoutDenisovan DNA existed over 44,000 years ago. The simplest explanation for thepresence of Denisovan genetic material in some but not all groups is that Denisovapeople themselves lived in Southeast Asia.’Finding the 50,000 year old finger bone of an Oceanian hominin in a cave inSiberia is another one of those facts that leap out to tell us the story of our distant pastwas a lot more complex and a lot more global than it initially appeared.A Taiwanese fisherman, 25 kilometres offshore, recently hauled up the jawbone,called Penghu 1, of what is probably another entirely new hominin species. It dates tobetween 130,000 and 190,000 years ago or 10,000 to 30,000 years ago. If those dateslook strange, that’s because they are. Being dredged from the ocean floor did not allowfor it to be studied in stratigraphic context, all the collagen had leached out, whichprevented radiocarbon dating, and U-series dating was unreliable due to a uraniumoverprint in the sea water. Nevertheless, that more recent date range puts Penghu 1 inthe same location as modern humans at a time when we were there.The potential for Sundaland and Sahul sexy times do not end here, either.Neanderthal admixture is often higher in East and Southeast Asian populations thanwith Europeans. It is also emerging that large amounts of genetic material responsiblefor our modern immune system – perhaps up to 70% – are the result of introgressionsfrom these archaic near-human species, and that this transfer occurred after we leftAfrica. In a literal sense, it was ‘laying with the daughters of Man’ that may have led tothe survival of the little colonial project we call modern humanity.A BRIEF MYTHOLOGICAL INTERLUDEI am aware that the suggestion that ‘laying with the daughters of Man’ has somehistorical corollary is often highly dubious. It has a tendency to lead very quickly toclaims that conehead aliens are our overlords and their descendants still run theworld. This arises from a persistent confusion of mythology with history. But as KarenArmstrong points out in A Short History of Myth:[I]n the pre-modern world, when people wrote about the past they were moreconcerned with what the event had meant. A myth was an event which, in somesense, happened once, but which also happened all the time. Because of ourstrictly chronological view of history, we have no word for such an occurrence,but mythology is an art form that points beyond history to what is timeless inhuman existence.84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"1Mythology allows for the retention of meaning within a culture, meaning thatmay have arisen as a result of historical events in the far distant past. It is our failureto recognise the conflation of timelines into contemporaneous religious expression.The Nephilim are not Denisovans who lived in Sundaland. However, there wasa scientifically observable sexual transfer of genetic material between males whoweren’t Homo sapiens and females who were in the distant past, which would havepresumably been reflected in the mythology of the time. It may well be that thisPalaeolithic mythology had some influence on the Eurasian stories that ultimatelybecame the Babylonian and Hebrew Nephilim stories. These encounters may well besurvivals of ‘Gondwana history’ into ‘Laurasian mythology.’ Interpreting any of these‘story layers’ literally or in isolation will lead you astray.A RETURN TO GENETICSBecause of the high frequency of their occurrence, mutations or adaptationsforming as a response to disease or environmental conditions are frequently used totrack ancient population movements. From the Spice Islands, which were mountainsat the time, we have a 30,000 year old genetic adaptation to cold weather. A verysimilar adaptation is found in contemporaneous samples from northern Europe. Asmentioned in the opening of this chapter, Sundaland had a temperate climate and was– and is – considerably warmer than northern Europe. The only environmental factorthat might lead to this adaptation would be open ocean travel, where it can get verycold and wet at night. This adaptation is found in Polynesian samples right across thePacific.Perhaps the most famous population marker is the Polynesian Motif. It isactually three separate malarial adaptations, from oldest to youngest, and the story ofits distribution is the story of Sundaland.The oldest of these 9 base-pair deletions, called by Dr Oppenheimer ‘the Asiangrandmother,’ is 60,000 years old and originates on the mainland. This alignswell with the current understanding of when Sundaland was originally inhabitedand from where. It also shows up in American samples but whether this isbecause the mutation happened before the populations separated and went northinto America or whether it was spread at a later date through the Pacific is notknown. It is probably both, as we have evidence from a study published in PLOSGenetics in April 2013 of trans-Pacific contact in Ainu blood samples datingback at least 6,000 years and possibly up to 10,000, based on culturalsimilarities between the Ainu and the Jōmon of Japan. If you are looking for the85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"23smoking gun for global sea travel right at the end of the Ice Age, then this mayturn out to be it.Returning to the Polynesian Motif, the second substitution is called ‘theSoutheast Asian mother’ and is most likely to have originated, as you mightexpect, in Southeast Asia or Island Southeast Asia. It is the most widelydistributed of the three markers, reaching right out into Oceania and Polynesia,as well as back into India and even up into Tibet. The birth of the SoutheastAsian Mother from the Asian Grandmother happened 30,000 years ago.The final substitution, the ‘true’ Polynesian Motif, originates in eastern Indonesia17,000 years ago – long before the end of the Ice Age – and spreads eastwardinto Melanesia perhaps around 6,000 years ago and then out into the Pacific withsuccessive waves of colonisers over the next five millennia. This ‘first stagefollowed by many stages’ aligns precisely with the hypothetical migrations of therefugees of a dramatic sea level rise and their descendants.It is useful to consider the specific genetic links between this corner of the worldand subsequent areas of examination. The map shows where else on the planet youcan find genetic evidence tying back to the Austronesian-speaking domain of IslandSoutheast Asia. It is highly suggestive of a shared origin for some physical and non-physical technologies.Most significantly, there is penetration of the Southeast Asian Mother into India,particularly in the north, as well as a sharp north/south divide that aligns well withcurrent archaeological interpretations of pre-Vedic and Dravidic divides. (Although Iexpect a further blurring of this archaeological divide in coming years.) South Indiaand Sri Lanka actually show more diversity in these 9 base-pair deletions fromSoutheast Asia, however they trace back to everywhere except the Malay Peninsula,where the Southeast Asian Mother originated. This diversity likely indicates sustainedeast-to-west contact at an earlier date. (Increasing diversity is associated with longerperiods in which mutations can form and be passed down.) Returning to DrOppenheimer:86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"fig. 6Specific genetic links between theAustronesian Homeland, Eurasiaand the South PacificThe final prediction of the southern Austro-Asiatic homeland hypothesis is thatthe migration of Austro-Asiatic speakers to India went through the Straits ofMalacca shortly after the rising sea opened it over 8,000 years ago ... A recentanalysis of Indian mtDNA types reveals not only multiple East Asian intrusionsinto the Indian subcontinent, but a clear north-south division as well. Anotherconclusion from this latter study is that the antiquity of East Asian mtDNAmarkers suggests a very ancient migration west.Asian mtDNA markers also show up very early in parts of Scandinavia,particularly in Finland. It is interesting to note that the Saami, whose Kalevala hasAsian and Pacific echoes, may be genetically the closest to those first Asian arrivals.Layering in thalassemia data on top of mtDNA results, a picture of contact fromSoutheast Asia, to India and the Bay of Bengal, stretching up into the Middle East andKurdistan also begins to form. Dr Oppenheimer concludes that genetic treesconstructed for Asian populations all have Southeast Asia placed in their oldestbranches. It is these same markers that were carried out into the Pacific, north alongthe Chinese coast and even across to the Middle East.87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Searching for the counter-hypothesis to the Southeast Asian influence onEurasian cultures and mythologies, the so-called ‘pincer model’ suggests there was asecond exodus out of Africa around 40,000 BCE that went eastward into Eurasia andthe Levant. If this were so, such an expedition would have left a genetic fingerprint thatwould allow us to easily identify the resulting Central Asian group. There is no suchevidence and so far no Central or North Asian lineages have been found that are notultimately derived from Southeast Asian ones.On the other side of the Pacific, more and more genetic data find themselves inalignment with the broad strokes of early human population movements as describedin both the Laurasian model and the linguistic analysis described below. Braziliangeneticist Sérgio Pena has found mtDNA markers in the skulls of the indigenousBotocudo people that also show up in Polynesians and as far afield as Madagascar,which is largely the same footprint as the Austronesian language group.So we have the geology of a sunken land, we have the genetic data indicatingfirst arrival and contact with other archaic humans and we also have blood markersindicating the spread of these people toward the corners of the globe most associatedwith the emergence of V. Gordon Childe’s concept of civilisation after the last greatsea level rise at the end of the Ice Age. What is so crucial to understand – and so oftenmisunderstood – is that these data show genetic contact with existing localpopulations, not the peopling of otherwise unoccupied lands from an origin inSoutheast Asia. Such a situation has mythological parallels in the flood stories of eachof the areas with evidence of contact: the arrival of wisdom teachers from a sunkenland across the sea. It is the contention of this book that some of these flood stories aretumbled down cultural memories of just such incidents.In the last chapter we were introduced to Dr Witzel’s Laurasian scheme, whichhe admits is currently lacking a homeland. Indologist to the last, it seems his refusal toconsider Sahul or Sundaland as the first place to give rise to the Laurasian storyline isdown to personal preference. In earlier versions of his thesis, Dr Witzel maintainedthat the rise of Laurasia was associated with the hypothetical ‘second exodus’ out ofAfrica into Central Eurasia, where the Laurasian theme developed, before realising ithas zero genetic evidence to support it. Rather than reconsider the growing evidenceof cultural and genetic complexity in Sahul/Sundaland, he relies on yet anotherhypothesis: ‘we will have to account for the spread of Laurasian mythologies intoSoutheast and East Asia with a different scenario – for example, a purely hypotheticalsecond wave of migration via India to Southeast Asia or a post-Ice Age reflux intoSoutheast Asia from what is now China by speakers of Tibeto-Burmese and Austriclanguages, whose ancestors had arrived there at C. 40 kya.’ Once again, we mention88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"the obligation of proof.Dr Witzel does, however, make the very good point that chickens and pigs, bothnative to Southeast Asia, are almost absent in other Laurasian mythologies. Theexpectation appears to be that this would not be the case if the Laurasian storylineemerged there. They may not be evident in mythologies, but they are certainly evidentin spiritual taboos and dietary prohibitions. By his own scheme, the rise of theLaurasian novel long predates the domestication of the pig or chicken so I am not surewhat kind of visibility he expects them to have in mythological motifs.Ultimately, the question then becomes whether we have data indicating the riseof cultural complexity in Sundaland so very long ago. And the answer is yes.LINGUISTICSHistorically, the study of ancient languages suffered from its own challenges todo with both artificial and real horizons. Because the field of linguistics first arosewithin Indo-European languages, it began by tracing its own family tree backwards,noting loan words and comparisons, effectively building a family tree back to apresumed root language. (Which, incidentally, arose in eastern Cappadocia, not overlyfar from Göbekli Tepe, around the time the temple was still in use.)Such analyses are fine, however they have a horizon of utility of about 7,000years ago, beyond which most competent linguists will tell you there simply aren’tenough words available for meaningful comparison. Dr Johanna Nichols, linguist atUC Berkley, makes this observation in her Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time:[T]here has been a strong tendency to approach all historical problems asproblems in the structure and description of family trees, as well as a tendencyto assume that the great majority of languages in any continent naturally go backto a single ancestor just as the great majority of languages in western Eurasiado. In fact, however, a number of historical problems ... are better approachedas population-typological or geographical issues. Such an approach has theadvantage that it can take us farther back in time than the comparative methodcan and see graspable facts and patterns where the comparative-historicalmethod has nothing at all to work with ... The fate of Indo-European, or moregenerally the fate of a group of typologically similar language families from post-Neolithic inner Asia, has not only distorted theory and method but skewed natureand reality as well.About 7,000 years ago is where our particular story ends rather than begins. To89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"get beyond this, Dr Nichols pioneered a methodology that, in terms of its usefulnessand implications, is on par with the discovery of archaeological stratigraphy.Briefly, she classified much of the world’s languages into yes/no categoriesbased on their grammatical structure. Do they have a ‘subject-object-verb’ wordorder, for instance. The resulting data lend themselves to a fascinating statisticalanalysis of linguistic diversity.To take just one example of the effects that can be observed, reductions inlinguistic diversity are often associated with rises in cultural complexity. On thesurface, this may appear counterintuitive but we know it from the historical period.The rise of empires led to the spread of Latin or Arabic or English or Spanish acrosspreviously diverse and discrete linguistic territories. This shows up as a reduction ingrammatical complexity as indigenous languages are either obliterated or hybridisedin order to facilitate economic and political communication across much larger landareas.[T]his survey has uncovered no evidence that human language in general haschanged since the earliest stages recoverable by the methods used here. Thereis simply diversity, distributed geographically. The only thing that hasdemonstrably changed since the first stage of humanity is the geographicaldistribution of diversity.Collections of grammatical structures – either increasing or decreasing incomplexity – can then be observed moving through the tongues of the world. What DrNichols discovered were three great stages in the peopling of the world.The first stage began in Africa more than a hundred thousand years ago and wasa time of great linguistic diversity. ‘Societies would have been small, simple andautonomous, and the environment was of course tropical, conditions that fosterdiversity today.’The second is called the stage of expansion, from about 60,000 years ago to30,000 years ago. It is characterised by population movements that would haverequired knowledge of seafaring and adaptation to sometimes extreme climates. ‘Thisstage too must have involved increasing diversity for that part of the linguisticpopulation that participated in the expansion, but it may ultimately have led to theextinction of many lineages that did not, for the genetic density in Africa and tropicalEurasia is now very low.’ The second stage aligns pleasingly with the location andtiming of the Southeast Asian Mother’s appearance in Sundaland.90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The third and final stage provides the most significant linguistic evidence for thecultural impact of cataclysmic survivors on the development of culture elsewhere inthe world. Beginning at the end of glaciation, Dr Nichols shows that it is ‘circum-Pacific colonisation that has populated most of the world, given rise to most of thegenetic lineages of human languages and colonised the New World.’ The trip to theAmericas was up from Sundaland rather than across from Siberia, following the sealevel rise that accompanied the end of the Ice Age.Narrowing back down to the dominant language family of the area,Austronesian, we find that it actually stretches all the way from Madagascar, along thecoast, through Island Southeast Asia and out into the vast Pacific. It is unrelated to anymainland Asian language families and its homeland has not been definitively identified,although Wilhelm Solheim believes it is probably in eastern Indonesia. He calls themaritime culture that developed it the Nusantao. As Dr Oppenheimer notes, ‘evennon-linguists might think it surprising there is not a single mainland tongue to give firmAsian provenance for the Austronesian family. Asia is after all the nearest continent.’Despite the complete lack of evidence, the spread of Austronesian into theregion was historically tied to the spread of rice cultivation into South East Asia. Theremay well be something to this theory, however recent archaeological evidencesuggests the spread went in the opposite direction, from the islands to the mainland.AGRICULTUREThere is a very ethnocentric perceptual bias in how we conceive of farming. Wetend to picture the classic amber waves of grain. This ignores the fact that for most ofagriculture’s history, most of the world’s population actually ate rice.The bias does not stop there. We also have a tendency to picture farming as thereplacement of indigenous plant life with one or two imports that are tended andharvested on an annual basis. But if we widen our definition to include cultivation oflocal species – to giving Nature a helping hand in doing what she was already doing –then the story becomes quite different, and significantly older.Yams, for instance, are absurdly easy to cultivate. You put a few of them in theground and ignore them. When you come back, you have a lot more. Wild yam andtaro cultivation was happening in Indonesia around 15,000 years ago. By about 7,000BCE we begin to see evidence of barley cultivation in the Indus Valley. At this time, inthe mountains of New Guinea, locals had been draining swamps for wild plantcultivation for millennia.91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Further north, the Jōmon of Japan had developed pottery for fish storage by13,000 BCE, indicating that the so-called ‘Pre Pottery Neolithic’ we see at GöbekliTepe is not a universal term. It is the Jomon, incidentally, who have the strongestgenetic links with the Americas. Stones for grinding wild cereals appear in theSolomon Islands 26,000 years ago, more than ten millennia earlier than in the FertileCrescent. Returning to the growing evidence for rice cultivation before the flood,remains have been found in two caves on the Malay Peninsula; the Spirit Cave and theSakai Cave, possibly going as far back as 10,000 BCE. This is significantly inadvance of rice cultivation on the Asian mainland. Rice is a remarkable plant. FromSri Owen’s Rice Book:Upland rices grow in forest clearings or unterraced hillsides, asking only forgenerous rainfall. Swamp or deepwater rices are happy in flood conditions nearriver mouths, able to grow 10–15 centimetres a day to keep pace with the risingwater level ... Traditional rice varieties reach maturity in anything from 140–240days; some modern ones mature in 90 days, allowing a quick-moving farmer togrow two, three, or even four crops in a year.That is another astonishing characteristic of irrigated rice. You can grow itin the same field, year after year, indefinitely – some rice fields are believed tohave been continuously cropped for two thousand years or more.If you are looking for the starch that would be the easiest to gradually cultivateover centuries of observation, and the one that would net the largest reward in doingso, then it is probably rice. We will never know if Sundaland’s river mouths heldcultivated rice fields but they were almost certainly home to the uncultivated grain.It is interesting to note that the earliest evidence of rice growing in Northern Indiaaligns with the timelines for genetic contact with Island Southeast Asia. It is similarlyinteresting to note that the latest evidence from the Zagros Mountains of Iran has ledarchaeologists to conclude that ‘there was no single origin for agriculture’ in the FertileCrescent as they have not found one. This interpretation, as Dr Oppenheimer pointsout earlier in this chapter, has an obligation of proof.Tracing the genetic origins of domesticated foods offers the alternatepalaeological researcher a plethora of smoking guns. You are unlikely to find lessscrupulous divisions between fact and interpretation. The sweet potato has beenproven to have arrived in the western Pacific (Sundaland) from the Americas ‘sometime in prehistory’ and then is ignored. The melon, an important foodstuff in China andIran around 5,000 BCE, must have been domesticated in Africa (or Australia) beforethat. The cucumber originated in the Himalayas but was grown in huge quantities in92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Ancient Egypt. Chickens, also Southeast Asian, appear in Egypt by 2,000 BCE. Recentmitochondrial research into the earliest domestication of chickens demonstrates thatthis Southeast Asian bird, fully domesticated, was found in Northern China by 10,500BCE.The dog appears to have been domesticated from a local wolf populationsomewhere south of the Yangtze 16,500 years ago, with the genetic diversity gettinghigher the further into Southeast Asia the samples came from.‘Lemon’ and ‘cinnamon,’ both Austronesian words referring to Southeast Asianplants, appear at the very beginning of the Indus culture. The Hindu words for clovesand camphor are also Austronesian imports, thus completing, in Dr Oppenheimer’swords, ‘a chain of Austronesian language contact stretching from Japan around thecoast of Asia to the birthplace of Western civilisation.’Further evidence of the high level of cultural complexity in what is now IslandSoutheast Asia can be found by looking in the opposite direction to the generalNorthwest path our story will follow. As we have seen, there is a high degree ofoverlap between Siberian shamanic and North American indigenous beliefs. This is tobe expected given the evidence for migration around the 10,000–15,000 BCE mark, atwhich point these cultures were solidly Laurasian. However, there is significantly lessoverlap between the indigenous beliefs of South America and North America, withSouthern cultures showing a much higher overlap with Melanesian and Australianbeliefs. Given the much earlier date of arrival into South America – between 30,000and 20,000 BCE at the latest – an opportunity to countercheck the cosmology ofSundaland presents itself. This will be explored in the next chapter.A QUESTION OF STRUCTURESGiven that we have to replace harbour breakwaters every century or so due tothe natural erosion of wave action, the expectation of finding the type of Palaeolithicremains that would satisfy a Hollywood set designer is, politely, ambitious. This wouldbe the case even if the end of the Ice Age had been a gradual process, but it isbecoming clear that, at least once in our history, human eyes witnessed mile-highsuperwaves hurtling back across the exposed ocean bed toward them. You only needto watch a few videos of the Japanese tsunami to see what can happen to eventechnologically advanced cultures following what was a tame sea incursion byhistorical standards.However, it is possible there are indeed remains of physical, potentiallymegalithic structures on Sundaland. Close to the Indonesian capital of Jakarta is a site93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"known as Gunung Padang, usually translated as ‘Mount Meadow/Field’ which doesnot make much sense. A secondary translation of ‘Mount of Light’ or ‘Mountain ofEnlightenment’ seems more likely.Gunung Padang is a large hill composed of overlapping, columnar basalt ‘logs’that form a rough step pyramid shape. Tens of millions of years ago, as the andesitelava cooled and contracted, cracks propagated throughout the rock. This processresulted in the creation of surprisingly geometric hexagonal ‘logs,’ clumped togetherlike a fistful of pencils. These columns form vertically but are comparatively easy todislodge and use for building material, even with the means available twenty thousandyears ago.Many of the columns are arranged horizontally into walls and also roofs ofinterior chambers that have been detected inside the structure. It is currentlycomposed of five terraces with a base that covers an area of 150 metres by 40metres. These terraces are outlined with what appear to be both building foundationsand pavements.Gunung Padang is aligned just off North, but directly faces another ‘holymountain’ in the same area, indicating that it may be part of a much large ritualcomplex. The hills surrounding Gunung Padang are currently used for growing tea buthave a very long history of gold mining. Indeed, the area has long-lived mythologicalassociations with gold. Old mines and tunnels are commonly found under theplantations. In light of the discovery of Gunung Padang’s advanced age, it is worthconsidering whether some of these tunnels require redating.Its summit today is about 3000 feet above sea level. During the Ice Age thiswould have been much higher as the sea level was much lower. In fact, from the top ofGunung Padang, you would have had a commanding view north across the plains andhills of Sundaland.94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"fig. 7Gunung Padang pyramidAccording to Dr Robert Schoch’s analysis of the geological evidence, whichencompasses ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity, seismic readings andbore hole drilling, the earliest use of the site definitely dates to 14,700 BCE andpotentially up to 22,000 BCE and beyond. At either end of this date range, we are stillfirmly in the Pleistocene and getting on towards Dr Witzel’s 30,000 BCE date for thedevelopment of Laurasian mythology which, you will recall, counts the Mound ofCreation among its mythemes.Staying with that idea, Dr Schoch has identified human-shaped, internal lavatubes within the mound. The entrance to one of them, at Layer 3, dates to around10,000 BCE which is right at the beginning of the end of the Ice Age. A major chamberwith a length of around 15 metres is located about 30 metres under the summit.

It is no reflection of Dr Natawidjaja’s scientific credentials – hereceived his PhD from Caltech – to suggest caution in interpreting the significance ofthese results. His was a government study and the idea that ‘Indonesia is Atlantis’ fallssquarely into the politics of science discussed in an earlier chapter. In confidentialdiscussions had during the research for this book, I have been made aware of the factthat there are a number of ‘true believers,’ so to speak, holding high office in theIndonesian government.None of this invalidates Dr Natawidjaja’s data but it certainly speaks of the needfor additional caution before conclusions can be drawn. We already know Island SouthEast Asia was a site of Ice Age cultural complexity. Sulawesi is home to some of theearliest cave art belonging to the Palaeolithic Renaissance, with an age of 40,000years ago. This date will likely be revised down, given it was drawn from the mineralaccretions on top of a painted handprint. In this exact corner of the world we have:Genetic evidence indicating mankind has been here for tens of millennia.Linguistic evidence indicating a rise in cultural complexity.Some of the earliest examples of the Palaeolithic Renaissance anywhere onearth.A climate that supported incidental contact with entheogens.Some of the earliest, if not the earliest, evidence for agriculture on earth.Subsequent genetic and linguistic links to the parts of the world we traditionallyassociate with the ‘rise of civilisation.’And now we have a very large, artificial structure that is highly resonant with thebeliefs and architecture of these later cultures.If this is not the actual homeland of Laurasia, and thus much of the westernmagical tradition, then the culture or cultures of Sundaland certainly had a profoundimpact on wherever that place may turn out to be. It is certainly an extreme case ofnon-random distribution.Where might we look to find evidence to validate this hypothesis?96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"VOf all the postulated different dispersals, the refugees whomay have retained their original culture with least dilutionare those who went east into the Pacific. – Dr StephenOppenheimer, Eden in the EastSTAR LORELet us begin with a story of two brothers. One is industrious, the other is lazyand feckless. The feckless one killed his industrious brother and then tried to deny theact to their father. The father curses his murdering son and sends him into exile, alongwith all his descendants. A similar story is told in New Guinea. Dr Oppenheimersuggests these tales may be mythological memories of population changesassociated with the peopling of the Pacific. There are numerous stories detailingfamily squabbles and brothers leaving with their families for distant islands so there ismuch to commend this suggestion.Similarly, wherever the first variant of Cain and Abel was told, it seems prettyclear it a mythological memory of hunter gatherers and early farmers uneasily livingin the same space. It may well be that the Tongan, New Guinean and Near Easternvariants are, in fact, localisations of the exact same incident. Even if they are not, the‘warring brothers’ mytheme is a component of the Laurasian ‘novel.’ There aremultiple examples of Laurasian mythology right across the Pacific. Essentially, everystory in the first ten or so books of the Bible is found in the mythology of Melanesia andPolynesia. The parallels are so startling that the first missionaries to arrive thoughtthey had discovered the lost tribe of Israel.These glaring similarities have led to some confused hypotheses over theyears, such as a South American or even Babylonian origin for the Pacific peoples.Today we have the Laurasian framework and genetic information pointing to an older,shared origin to understand why these parallels exist. The watery creation, theseparation of sky and earth, the creation of man from earth and woman from his side,the duelling brothers, the flood. All are in evidence and all had to come fromsomewhere. Which brings us to geography.It is not often evident when looking at a flat map, but the Pacific Ocean is ahemisphere. The colonisation of its tiny islands is a feat of exploration unmatched until97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"the moon landing. Beginning in the Southwest Pacific, the first grouping of islands tothe east of New Guinea is known as Melanesia, meaning ‘middle islands.’ Furthereast from them – including New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island – is Polynesia,meaning ‘many islands.’ To the north of New Guinea, the islands – including Guam,Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap – are known as Micronesia, which you can probably guessmeans ‘small islands.’The origin of the Austronesian-speaking, agricultural, open-ocean-navigatingPolynesians is finally undergoing a rare academic sea change (if you’ll excuse thepun). Previously, it was stated that the Austronesian-speaking Polynesians emergedfrom mainland Asia via Taiwan, bringing with them a distinctive pottery style, knownas Lapita, around 1500 BCE, sailed to Melanesia and then quickly – we are talking ascant few centuries – colonised the entirety of Polynesia, all the way to Easter Island.This is despite the fact there is no evidence for Lapita pottery in mainland Asia and, aswe saw in the preceding chapter, no evidence for an Austronesian language homelandthere, either.When combined with the more recent genetic evidence, and even sites likeGunung Padang, frankly, it becomes clear that the continuity of culture in EasternMelanesia is very long-lived indeed. We are dealing with cultural groups that havebeen occupying this area since before the end of the Ice Age. Lapita pottery is certainlyexcellent evidence of trade and migration around 800 BCE, but we need to considerthe ‘mystery’ of the Polynesian homeland solved. It is under the sea, just where theyhave always said it was.Whenever they first made it to Melanesia, these Ice Age ‘climate refugees’existed in a state of near total isolation right up until the arrival of Europeans. As such,they offer us the best example on earth of a ‘control group’ to ascertain whichelements of the western magical tradition may be antediluvian survivals andspecifically survivals from a sunken homeland.

This placeis the Pacific in general and Polynesia in particular. Dr Oppenheimer once again:The Polynesians’ spiritual life was rich with large pantheons. In all groups theSun God was paramount and in some he was called Ra, as in Ancient Egypt.Almost without exception their myths recalled a lost earthly paradise to the westor the northwest, called variously Avaiki and Bolutu. A story similar to Adam andEve is widespread, with most languages using ivi as the word for a bone. A storyof two brothers of different cultures having a fight was prevalent.

It is this mismatchbetween cultural complexity, its origin and the total amount of land ‘undermanagement,’ so to speak, that has tripped up atlantologists for more than twocenturies and led to them (and me at least once) launching diving expeditions off thecoast of Pacific islands in search of sunken ruins.The Pacific is one of the few places on earth where the archaeology, geneticsand local mythologies are actually in alignment. Maori iwi can trace their descendantsback a specific number of generations to the waka they arrived on. We can bereasonably confident regarding the dates of colonisation of Pacific islands. This is notto say they were not known of or even used before these dates, of course. In fact theyvery probably were, as we shall see. But the earliest dates for the continuousoccupation of some of the farther flung islands by these specific cultures is not going tomove much beyond the second half of the first millennium CE, thousands of yearsafter the end of the Ice Age.Magic does not warp very often. Ritual magic is inherently conservative.Laurasian magic in particular is entirely predicated on following the correct procedure.In the books of Jake Stratton-Kent you can observe this inherent conservation of formeven as Mesopotamian and Greek gods and daimons become the spirits and demonsof the grimoires.

The ocean could be read in away that is entirely opaque to modern eyes. Water colouration, the appearance ofcertain birds, how the light refracts at the horizon, the arrival of bioluminescentplankton or fish at certain times of the year, these were the compasses and sextants ofthe Sundaland people. Over the horizon travel and deep water fishing were occurringby 30,000 BCE. Today, the Torres Strait Islanders – who we will meet below – usestellar scintillation, stars’ twinkling effect, to determine levels of moisture andturbulence in the atmosphere, enabling them to predict weather patterns. Planets areof no use to them because they do not twinkle. I believe this behaviour may have beenmore widespread and could be significant in determining why stellar mythologypredates planetary mythology.Eclipsing the flawed ‘mainland Asia’ theory for the origins of the Polynesianargonauts is a model devised by Wilhelm Solheim known as the Nusantao MaritimeTrading and Communication Network (NMTCN). Taking the name Nusantao fromnusa meaning ‘south’ and tao meaning ‘man/people,’ Solheim posits a multidirectionalexpansion of an open-ocean trading network centred in what was then easternIndonesia or possibly the Philippines. He suggests that the single-outrigger canoe wasinvented around 13,000 years ago, just before the end of the Ice Age, and that openocean trading occurred principally in the Sunda and Sahul areas but also stretchingnorth up to Japan and as far west as Madagascar by 5,000 BCE. His evidence is botharchaeological: obsidian trading, etc; and linguistic: the footprint of the Austronesianlanguage. Much like the earliest sailing nursery, the vast distances between SoutheastAsia, Madagascar and probably all the way to Africa were reliably navigable thanks tothe Monsoon winds. Over a 12 month period you could catch them one way and thencatch them back home again. The NMTCN was the vector for the transmission ofideas, genes and artefacts across half the world and it is from these cultures that thePolynesian argonauts developed and went on to ultimately colonise the Pacific.So even before the end of the Ice Age, you have an extant sailing nursery thatdevelops over millennia from rafts to canoes to outrigger canoes that becomes ademi-global trading network once much of the land sinks beneath the ocean. Andwhere you have a sailing nursery, you have what we can cheekily call a stellarnursery.101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The University of New South Wales’s Duane Hamacher is doing amazing workin the field of Indigenous Australian astronomy and astrotheology. Much of it involvesinvestigating the oral survival of stories of ancient meteor impacts and volcaniceruptions and the like. It thus provides a useful counterpoint to Dr Witzel’s dismissalof the possibility that mythology can encode memories of actual events becauseHamacher has demonstrated that it clearly can. This information has been a long timecoming. Most non-Australians are only dimly aware of just how raw the deal was thatthe First Australians received, even by colonial standards. They were not evenincluded on the census as members of the Commonwealth until 1967 and, to this day,there is a widespread belief that no Aboriginal counting system went above thenumber four. Such were the racial headwinds preventing a thorough examining ofAustralia’s indigenous astromythology.In many ways, this is surprising. So much of indigenous life is defined byastronomy. The sun, moon and stars are used for time-keeping, hunting calendars,navigation over land and sea, as well as informing customs, taboos and socialhierarchies. Knowledge of the night sky is transmitted through ritual, song, story, rockart, and the arrangement of sacred stones. The traditions associated with certainasterisms are used to describe the origins of man, animals and the landscape. Quite anumber of these asterisms represent, to my mind, Gondwana-era spirits that havesurvived into the modern day, making them tens of thousands of years older thanwestern esotericists commonly assume.Some examples, then, beginning with my personal favourite, from the Arrerntepeople of the western Central Desert. During the Dreaming, a group of women/starswere dancing a corroboree (ceremony) beside the Milky Way. One of the star womenput her baby down in its coolamon (basket) beside the Milky Way. Because they weredancing, the women did not notice that the baby and its coolamon fell to earth, drivingthe ground up where it landed. The coolamon fell on top of the baby and hid it from itsdistraught parents, who, to this day, search for it every night. They are the MorningStar and the Evening Star. The coolamon can still be seen in the night sky under theMilky Way, falling to earth. It is the Southern Cross.Are we spying an early version of the ‘Baby by the River’ motif commonly foundin the Near East? Perhaps. In the case of Orion and the Pleiades, however, I will putmoney on it. Hamacher points out that many Aboriginal cultures associate Orion withgroups of young men, particularly hunters or fishermen. The asterism and itsassociated stories often form the basis of important male initiation rites. In the Yolngulanguage, Orion is called Djulpan. The three belt stars are three brothers sitting in acanoe, across its width. Betelgeuse is the front of the canoe and Rigel is the back. The102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"brothers were blown into the sky for illegally capturing a kingfish – i.e. violating ataboo. The kingfish is what we would call Orion’s sword.Another story from the Central Desert has Orion, called Nyeeruna, chase theseven sisters of the Pleiades known as the Yugarilya. He is kept apart from them bythe eldest sister, Kambugudha, who is the Hyades asterism. Kambugudha constantlycounters Nyeeruna’s fire magic and club with her own fire magic, while other astralbodies taunt him for his failures.All in all, 90% of the collected Aboriginal stories associate Orion with a hunter orhunters and the Pleiades with a woman or a group of women. Noting the high degreeof similarity between European and Indigenous Australian mythemes, Hamacherobserves, ‘This may indicate either cultural convergent evolution, reflecting thesubjective masculine and feminine appearance of Orion and the Pleiades respectively,or else suggest a much earlier story common to both cultural roots.’ The formersuggestion is one of those pseudoscientific glosses common to academia when it isconfronted by the latter suggestion and its implications.Stories of the stars are also used for timekeeping and maintaining huntergatherer calendars. Staying in the Central Desert, when the Pleiades rise with themorning sun, the Pitjantjatjara people know that the dingoes are pupping. Kambugudhaplaced dingo pups between Nyeeruna and her sisters in one telling of the Orion legend.In Victoria, the Wergaia traditions tell of a time when the people faced drought andstarvation. A woman called Marpeankurric went out searching for food for her tribe.Eventually she found a nest and dug up thousands of nutritious ant larvae thatsustained her people through the drought. Upon her death, she ascended to the sky andbecame the star Arcturus. When Marpeankurric rises in the evening, the local peopleknow it is the time of the year to harvest the ant larvae.TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER STAR LOREThe Torres Strait Islands are located between Australia’s northernmost tip andPapua New Guinea. There are 250 islands over 48,000 kilometres of shallow oceanwater. Fourteen of the islands are inhabited.Although Torres Strait Islanders are Indigenous Australians, they are notAborigines but are, in fact, Melanesians. Their culture dates back 8,000 years whenthe islands were formed at the end of the Ice Age. As such, their highly sophisticatedastromythology affords us one of the best attempts to recreate the cosmology of thesunken Sahul and Sunda areas at the time of their inundation. I believe it is here thatwe can see ‘missing link species’ between Gondwana and Laurasian mythology. It103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"may be we are looking at the ‘first draft’ of Dr Witzel’s novel.As you would expect, Orion and the Pleiades feature, as Utimal and Usmal.Their rising in the November skies tells the islanders to plant their gardens in advanceof the Kuki season, a time when strong winds and heavy rain blow from the northwestand the intervals between the storms feature no wind at all. This is not good sailingweather. Utimal and Usmal also mark the time when the turtles and dugong arebreeding.Appealing on a personal level, there is the stellar shark, Baidam, which iscomprised of some of the stars of Ursa Major. When Baidam appears in the skiesover New Guinea, the islanders know it is time to start planting sweet potato andbanana. When Baidam’s nose touches the horizon at sunset, it is tiger shark breedingseason – very much not a time you want to be in or on the water.TagaiTagai is the principal Torres Strait Islander creation deity in a very Gondwanansense of the term: he is the culture hero from whom the laws and customs descendbut he did not create the universe. He is a great fisherman whose form encompassesseveral asterisms in the southern sky: the Southern Cross is his left hand holding aspear, his right hand is the constellation Corvus and he stands in a canoe that isformed by the stars of Scorpius.One day, Tagai descended from the stars to go fishing in his outrigger canoe witha crew of 12 zugubals, beings who take on human form when they descend to earth.Unable to catch anything, Tagai leaves the canoe to try spearfishing on a nearby reef.He tells the crew not to drink his water while he is gone. The zugubals finish all theirown water and, because it is a very hot day, they then drink Tagai’s water – violating ataboo. Tagai returns and finds all his water gone. Furious, he kills them all, separatesthem into two groups of six and returns them to the sky, where they form theconstellations of Usmal (Pleiades) and Utimal (Orion), thus providing anothermen/hunters/Orion connection. So angry is Tagai that he places the two groups ofzugubals in the northern half of the sky and demands they never come near him,which is why Tagai stays in the southern half of the sky.PERSISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENTIt is clear that many Gondwana elements such as the Rainbow Serpent, theviolation of taboo and the origin of humans and tribal technology have persisted in thenight sky. The stars are a remarkable storage facility for cultural knowledge. It is my104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"contention that the development of star lore from ‘tribal library’ to ‘life cycle calendar’to ever more precise navigational systems is in some way associated with the rise ofLaurasian mythology, and thus astrology and western magic. It is important to realisethat ‘development’ in this context does not mean ‘evolutionary improvement’ but ratherthe additional layering of complexity into the continuation of earlier star lore. Considerthat using spirit beings represented by asterisms such as Baidam or Tagai to navigateis to literally be guided by specific gods, and the ability to predict their arrival, timingand movements is to have either the power of, or power over, the gods. The storiesassociated with these beings and their asterisms remain. They have simply had anadditional function layered onto them.Eventually, continual improvements in the accuracy of prediction may havegiven rise to the ‘magical immortality tech’ of the Vedic, Harappan and Near Easterncivilisations, in particular, the rise to prominence of the planets over the constellations.Planets are almost useless to navigators, obviously, but they are very useful if you arein the business of creating and running a royal mythological calendar. Theirmovements are more rapid, more dramatic, and thus require the shamans andnascent priestly class to demonstrate ever more complex mathematical abilities. It isto that increasing complexity that we now turn.SPLENDID ISOLATIONThe Polynesians have an unmistakably Laurasian cosmology and are self-evidently the planet’s best ancient navigators. As a control group they are very usefulin calibrating the continuation of Palaeolithic forms – the spirits as asterisms – withinthe ‘civilisational’ context of the post-Ice Age era. When examining the followingmythemes, it is useful to consider again the words that open this chapter: ‘may haveretained their original culture with least dilution.’ It is very unlikely we are looking atthe direct transfer of the cosmology of a sunken land. These are purely Polynesianmyths. They are, however, the best pieces we have available to attempt anyhypothetical reconstruction. For those unfamiliar with Polynesia, the many similaritiesto the western esoteric tradition are remarkable. By the time we reach EasternPolynesia, you will feel right at home.TangaroaThe god of the ocean and most commonly the creator. Depending on the island,Tangaroa is also called Tagaloa (Tongan), Ta’aroa (Tahitian), Kanaloa (Maori),Tangaloa (Hawaiian). In the Marquesas, Tangaroa is called Tanaoa and is the god ofthe Primeval Darkness. In other islands he is known simply as A’a. (A’a is also a105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Hawaiian name for Sirius.) It is interesting to note the phonic similarities found inPolynesian mythology with Ra – sun god in the Pacific and Egypt – and the SumerianEa, nearly identical to A’a.So huge is Tangaroa that he only breathes twice every two hours, which causesthe low and high tides on the ocean. In the Tahitian story, Ta’aroa means ‘Unique One,’which I interpret to mean ‘First, Alone.’ Before creation he lived in the Cosmic Egg,turning endlessly in infinite darkness. In some versions of the story, the eggshell is allthat separates earth and sky. One day he cracked the egg and called out. The emptyuniverse did not respond. He threw part of his shell into the air to create the heavens.He used the other part to create the rocks and the sand. Angry and horrified at hisempty universe, he dismembered himself and built Creation. In the Tuamotu versionof this act, he made the clouds out of his skin, the mountains from his spine, the fertileearth from his flesh, the trees from his feathers, the fish from his nails, thecrustaceans and eels from his innards and he used his blood to dye the sky red. Onlythen did the first day dawn. Throughout this act of dismemberment, Ta’aroa remainedTa’aroa, and in his head he conjured into existence all the other gods. His shell,despite being broken, also remained as the principal point of creation, and everythingbecame its own version of this shell: thus the earth is a complete shell, the humanbody is a complete shell, and so on. Everything is ‘shell shaped,’ reflecting its ultimateorigin in the cosmic egg.Here we find the expected mytheme of the universe being created from adismembered giant. More interestingly we have a creation story that looks Brahmanicand a microcosm/macrocosm view of the universe as Mind of God that you would beforgiven for mistaking as Hermetic.TaneStaying with the Tuamotu, Tane was the second son of Atea, the Sky Father.They eventually fought for rulership like Zeus and Chronos.In the Maori stories of Tane, he is the son of Rangi, the Sky Father and Papa, theEarth Mother. Tane separated the eternal embrace of his parents so that light couldenter the world. He was constantly battling with his brother the storm god Tawhiri.There is not a single part of this story that is not found in Egypt.Tane is also known as the Lord of the Forests, Tane-Mahuta. Tawhiri chasedTane’s fish children from the forests into the ocean where they were ruled byTangaroa. These are probably the Taiparu or ‘Peerless Ones,’ a Pacific version offaery beings, as Tane was their lord. There are repeated fish/star symbol crossovers106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"in the Pacific and Southern India. It is interesting to note the fish symbolism of wisdomteachers in places such as Sumeria, probably noting their descent from particulargods/asterisms.In an act with faintly biblical overtones, after separating his parents, Tanecovered his father’s nakedness with the God of Mists, Kohu, the Milky Way, calledIka-Roa, and their children, who were the stars.When Tane’s mother, Papa (confusing, I know), refused his sexual advancesTane created the first woman out of Hawaiian sands, Hine-hau-one, or ‘Earth Girl.’Their daughter, Hine-nui-te-po also subsequently refused her father’s advances andfled to the Underworld where she became the goddess of Death. Note the ‘Nuit’ in thename.MauiMaui could be the archetypal civilising trickster. In some variants of the‘separation of sky and earth,’ this feat is accomplished by Maui, not Tane.When he was born prematurely, Maui’s mother threw him into the ocean,paralleling the numerous ‘abandoned baby by the water’ motifs. He lengthened thedaylight hours so that humans had more time for work by slowing the sun using hisdead grandmother’s jawbone; a fairly transparent piece of astrotheology.Maui also stole fire from the people of the underworld and gave it to mankind. Inanother adventure in the underworld, Maui attempted to achieve immortality bypassing through the vagina of his grandmother Hine-nui-te-po, the goddess of Death,and out her mouth. He failed and was killed, triggering the permanent withdrawal ofimmortality as an option for humans and beginning the taboo against incest.Stories of Maui also contain a dragon-slaying motif. The wife of a giant sea eel,Te Tuna (‘The Penis’) ran away and began a passionate affair with Maui. Eventually TeTuna sought her out, triggering a tidal wave with his penis as he approached land.Maui deflected the wave by displaying his own penis. They fought and sexuallyentered each other before Maui was ultimately victorious, beheading Te Tuna andburying his head. From his head sprouted the first coconut tree, which gave mankindsolid and liquid sustenance. The violent sexual encounter has echoes of the story ofSet and Horus, among others. As is common with the Trickster motif, many of Maui’sstories are sexually graphic, if not downright bawdy.The Sacred Tree107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Maui’s is not the only motif associated with the coconut tree, as you mightexpect. Genetically American, the presence of the coconut across every piece ofhabitable land in Polynesia is physical evidence of sustained trans-oceanic adventuresthousands and thousands of years ago. Given the shape of the coconut, many of thestories involve decapitation. I suspect, however, that this is a genus-specific version ofa wider shamanic/tree spirit/dismemberment story.From eastern Papua, one story involves a man who would always return at theend of each day with his basket full of fish. Jealous, the other men followed him to thebeach one morning to discover his secret. On the beach, the man removed his headand stowed it under a bush before walking into the water. Once in the water, all thenearby fish swam into his gullet. Returning to land, he vomited them all up, restoredhis head to his shoulders, threw the small ones back into the ocean and placed thelarge ones in his basket. The next morning the other men took the fisherman’s headand buried it. When he returned to the beach and found it gone, he fled back into thesea, turned into a fish and was never seen again. Where the head was buried sprouteda coconut tree. Interestingly, it was a woman who first tasted its magical flesh, just asin the Eden story.The coconut origin story from the island of Djaul involves even moredismemberment. Two brothers were returning to land with their canoe laden with fishwhen the sea giant, Lumukaka, appeared. They threw the fish to him and fled butLumukaka pursued them. The younger brother told his older brother to cut off his armand throw it to the sea giant. This only slowed him a little so he told his brother to cutoff his other arm. And then his two legs. By the time they reached land, the youngerbrother was just a torso and a head. The boys’ grandfather said to bury the youngerbrother’s head, which they did. The next day the older brother went to the burial siteand found a puppy. His grandfather said to leave it alone because it will turn into acoconut tree that will provide food, drink and firewood, which it did.The puppy element is interesting given the role of canines as gatekeepersbetween the human world and the otherworld. Beyond this, thedismemberment/sacred tree motif is seen (along with a canine) in the story of Osiriswho is dismembered and trapped in cedar. Contained in the tree/immortality story wehave the repeated refrains of the trickster and the hunter/fisherman. In the case ofOsiris this gives us another overlap with the constellation of Orion.Dr Oppenheimer suggests that the sacred tree/sustaining life motif may havehad its origin in the earliest days of Sundaland with the indigenous banana tree; thecoconut still millennia from appearing on Sunda beaches. In a very literal sense, the108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"banana tree is the father of a tribe because of its abundance and caloric densityallowing for population growth. It is also interesting to note in passing that the bananashares 50% of its DNA with mankind.AtutuahiAtutuahi is the star Canopus, hymned as ‘the Mother of the Moon and Stars.’Sometimes male, Atutuahi is one of the primary stars used by the Polynesians foropen ocean navigation, equivalent to the Northern Hemisphere’s Pole Star. (There isno Pole Star in the Southern Hemisphere and there will not be one for around 2,000years.)Phil Coppens, in The Canopus Revelation mentions that the lack of awarenessof the primacy of Canopus in Ancient Egypt is odd and may be due to the fact that thestar is not visible in the skies of Western Europe; home to most of the world’sEgyptologists. Though his underlying thesis that Canopus is the ‘true’ Osirian starlacks credible evidence, the association is nevertheless there in part (along withKhonsu) and could be due to a survival of the much earlier association of Orion andcanoes/fishing, given its subsequent Greek association with ships and the Argo.Consider Coppens’s characterisation of the status of Canopus in Hinduism; the star isknown as Agastya, a Rishi (sage). It is the helmsman of Argha, son of Varuna,goddess of the waters.The Serpent and the TreeReturning to the tree, we have repeated serpent/tree symbolism that containshybrid versions of the serpent/civilising trickster from Gondwana mythology and themore familiar serpent/tree/taboo symbolism from Laurasian stories.On the North New Guinean island of Siar, there is a legend of a group of hunterscatching a snake in a tree. They decide they will eat it the next day. That evening, allthe women of the group had a dream where the snake told them, ‘if you eat me, thewhole tribe will be drowned.’ Only one woman took the dream seriously and sailedaway with her two children, a boy and a girl. The other tribesfolk ate the snake and thevillage sank beneath the ocean. The woman’s two children are the ancestors of Siarand the nearby islands.In Fiji, the giant serpent, Degei, who had always existed, lived in the sky withone other being, a she-hawk called Turukawa. One day, Turukawa laid two eggs, onecontaining a human boy and the other containing a human girl. Degei kept the eggswarm in his coils until they hatched. Degei then created the banana tree to feed them109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"as children. When they were grown, he taught them to grow and harvest yams andtaro. He also gave them fire and taught them speech. Later these two children went onto populate the earth.IoIo is a very common Polynesian name for the high creator god. Like ‘Ra’ and‘Ea,’ which persist in Near Eastern and North African civilisations, I suspect this is anexample of a very, very long-lived sacred syllable. Consider how close Ea, IAO,Yahweh and Io sound when said out loud. The word also means ‘hawk’ in Hawaiian.Linguist and Pacific scholar Jan Knappert believed the word may have been taboo,replaced with Atua, which means ‘Old One.’The most common story involves Io speaking light into being when there wasonly darkness upon the waters. He then contemplated light and called darkness back,creating the first day. It is also often Io that separates the sky from the land. In Maorimythology, Io is both god of the house and of knowledge. Some of his epithets were Io-Te-Waiora, ‘Io, the Source of Life’ and Io-Matua-Te-Kore, ‘Io who has no parents.’ Thetale is told in a Maori hymn to Io:lo dwelt within the breathing-space of immensity.The Universe was in darkness, with water everywhere.There was no glimmer of dawn, no clearness, no light.And he began by saying these words,That He might cease remaining inactive‘Darkness become a light-possessing darkness.’And at once light appeared.(He) then repeated those self-same words in this manner.That He might cease remaining inactive:Light, become a darkness-possessing light.And again an intense darkness supervened.Then a third time He spake saying:110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"‘Let there be one darkness above,Let there be one darkness below.Let there be one light above,Let there be one light below,A dominion of light, a bright light.’And now a great light prevailed.(lo) then looked to the waters which compassed him about,and spoke a fourth time, saying:‘Ye waters of Tai-kama, be ye separate. Heaven, be formed.’Then the sky became suspended. ‘Bring forth thou Tupua-horo-nuku.’And at once the moving earth lay stretched abroad.This comes from the 1907 Journal of the Polynesian Society, translated by HareHongi, which relates that these words were ‘transmitted down through thegenerations. Our priests joyously referred to them as being the ancient and originalsayings.’ The hymn was also used as an incantation to quicken barren wombs, to liftup depressive hearts and anywhere else that installation of a little Light may be useful.Castor and PolluxIn Polynesia, the stars of Gemini are known as Hui Tarara. In a parallel to Indianstar lore, they were originally human and fled to the sky, becoming stars, when theyheard they were to be separated.Another name for Pollux is Rehua. He is the star god, living in the highestheavens, a realm no human has ever reached. His son, Kaitangata, fell to earth, andthe blood from his fall is the sunset. Maui is descended from Rehua, the star god.The MoonIt is a common mistake to assume that traditional cultures saw the moon asfemale when it appears that a slim majority of them actually saw it as male. Thesuggestion for why this is so – which I find credible – is that in hunter-gatherercultures, it was the men who ‘went away’ or ‘journeyed’ in hunting parties, just as the111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"moon does. The sun is much more reliable and thus appears as female more oftenthan you would expect. (Attending an Australian school, we used to sing an Aboriginalfolk song called sun-a-rise, she come every morning.)Thus is it unsurprising that the Polynesians saw the moon as male. Sort of. Yes,Marama is the moon god, but his wife Ina (or Rona) is the moon goddess. Think ofthem more as occupants of our satellite, rather than it being a manifestation of one orthe other. Ina taught the women of the earth to weave baskets. In Hawaii, she is calledHina and is goddess of the fish. She taught Hawaiian women how to make barkcloth.On the island of Aitutaki, Ina’s husband was a human she took back up to themoon. When he showed signs of ageing, she created a rainbow bridge to send himback to earth so that he could die.Night and the Morning StarVenus is known as Kopu or Malara, and, according to Jan Knappert, ‘she ismuch admired for her beauty.’ As previously mentioned, the goddess of the night skyis called Hine-Nui-Te-Po, which I find highly suggestive of Nuit.KingshipConsider how many ‘alternative history’ books would have remained unwrittenhad we not confused kings descending from the stars with kingship descending fromthe stars! In Polynesia, a king, ariki rahi, became a divine being at the moment of hiscoronation. His kingship was ordained by and descended from the stars and his wordbecame law.I believe the increasing complexity in star lore over the millennia – and inparticular that first jump toward precise measurement that is in some way associatedwith the rise of the Laurasian ‘novel’ – has much to do with the emergence of divinelyordained, absolute rulers. Priests are ever putting ‘their man’ on the throne. Correctlydating this concept throws a very unflattering light on some of the zanier origintheories for the Pharaohs and Sumerian kings.SpiderIn Micronesia, the creator god is known as Nareau. Before creation, he walkedalone through the primeval matter of Te-Po-ma-Te-Maki, ‘the Darkness of theEmbrace.’ Nareau used a giant eel to separate ‘the embrace’ of earth and sky. Hefashioned the first man and woman from earth and water. These two humans gave112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"birth to several of the gods, including the god of the Waves; Na Kika, the octopus; andRuki, the sea serpent.AriesIn Hawaii, the constellation of Aries is called Kūkalani’ehu, ‘Kū of the mistyheavens.’ He is the god (akua) of war on Kaua’i and O’ahu.PleiadesThe rising of the seven star spirits of Matariki, ‘little eyes’ in the skies aboveNew Zealand in late May or early June is considered Maori new year. Just as we sawin the Torres Strait, the cluster is a cornerstone of both agricultural and hunter-gatherer calendars across the Pacific.Milky WayConsidered the property of the Night Goddess in parts of Polynesia, the MilkyWay is known as Ika-Roa, ‘The Long Fish, who Gave Birth to all the Stars.’ Here thefish/star symbolism that I suspect we see in Sumeria is repeated. In some variants,Ika-Roa is simply the Mother of the Stars.A Maori motif that has similarities to the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginalmyths sees Tane gathering up clumps of little stars in his canoe and this is what formsthe Milky Way, a rather beautiful image.PyramidsIt is not very widely known that pyramids and other stepped, sacred platformswere built on a very large scale across the Pacific. Most were razed by missionaries.They were called either marae or morai, which according to Jan Knappert meant theycontained ‘houses of god’ within them. One such structure in Tahiti measured 267 feetin length. Given the recent dating of Gunung Padang in Indonesia, and the fact that itwas a large hill shaped into a step pyramid, the case for a Sahul/Sunda origin for thisparticular type of sacred architecture is considerably strengthened.RAPA NUIAN EXCEPTIONALISMRapa Nui, or Easter Island, has long fascinated historians and researchers ofevery stripe. It is probably the most isolated place on earth, being more than 2,000kilometres away from the nearest inhabited island (Pitcairn, population: 67) and 3,700kilometres off the Chilean coast. The enigmatic moai – statues with elongated heads,113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"•••••••tiny hands and piercing eyes – stare out across the endless ocean with their mouthsresolutely shut. If there is anywhere that absolutely breaks the mainstream model ofPacific history it is here. The accepted version of events does not stand up to even theslightest scrutiny. How could it? Officially, Rapa Nui was the last of the Pacific islandsto be colonised, yet it has the most extreme examples of megalithic and astronomicalculture found anywhere in the ocean.The orthodox chronology is as follows:Rapa Nui is believed to have been first colonised between 700 AD and 1200 AD.The population peaked at 15,000 but a combination of disease andmismanagement of resources dropped it down to around 3,000 by the time ofEuropean contact a few centuries later. This would make it fairly unique in theover-managed Polynesian world.The rulers had hundreds and hundreds of moai built ‘to keep the farmers busy inthe off season.’It was discovered by Dutch explorers on Easter Sunday, 1722, hence its name.By this point the local culture was in a degenerate state and very few of the RapaNui people could read their mysterious Rongorongo script.Let us have a closer look at these 887 moai, through the eyes of a tenuredgeologist, Dr Robert Schoch. In his Forgotten Civilisation: The Role of SolarOutbursts in Our Past and Future, he records the following observations from hisvisits to Rapa Nui.The average weight for one of the moai is twelve tonnes. The largest is 75tonnes and an unfinished moai, still in its quarry, is approximately 250 tonnes.Those farmers must have had a long off-season.There appear to different eras of moai building, with the earliest probably beingcarved from basalt. Dr Schoch observed some of these basalt moai had beenrepurposed into dwellings and sacred platforms, as well as showing signs ofbeing recarved. (The moai in the British museum has later carving all down itsback.) For a stone object to be repurposed it is, by definition, older than thestructures it is incorporated into.Despite the island’s small land area, the basalt quarries have yet to be located.Based on his understanding of volcanic stratigraphy, Dr Schoch suggests theywould not be found where the other quarries are located – toward the top of the114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"•••••volcano – but lower down, perhaps under the current sea level.Probably the world’s most famous SCUBA diver, Jacques Cousteau, observedlarge, rectangular cut-outs in underwater basalt that resemble the holes left inRapa Nuian quarries. It is very unlikely the Rapa Nui were undersea miners,which begs the question of when these rectangular quarry marks were abovesea level.Just as with his observations of the water erosion on the Sphinx, Dr Schochnoticed varying levels of erosion on the moai, indicating dramatically differentages for some of them.Some of the moai have sedimentation built up around them to a depth of sixmetres. Based on an analysis of the difference in sedimentation between todayand photos of the same moai from 130 years ago, Dr Schoch has calculated thatsome of the moai were installed at a vastly earlier date than is currentlyaccepted by historians.The long-fingered, thin-armed carvings on the moai are highly reminiscent ofthe T-pillars at Göbekli Tepe, even down to the way the hands rest on theabdomen, almost in an asana pose.There are shaped lava tunnels on Rapa Nui. If it transpires that the tunnelsinside Gunung Padang in Indonesia are also shaped by human hands, and allavailable evidence suggests that is the case, then it may be another culturalcontinuity.All of these observations are in addition to the persistent challenge of how thesemulti-tonne objects were placed on their sacred platforms, called ahu. In manyinstances, the moai have been installed miles from where they were struck from therock. Local legend says they were walked into place, or flew through the air by the useof mana. A similar story accounts for the appearance of the giant basalt logs that builtNan Madol on Pohnpei. They come from a promontory on the other side of a verymountainous island and the one modern attempt to move a smaller log by raft sankimmediately in the harbour when the log was placed upon it.As for the suggestion that the Rapa Nui people debased their own environmentand were living in a state of near-total social collapse at the time of first Europeancontact, this is one of those historical theories – like the Aryan Invasion Theory of India– that has been completely dismissed for a lack of evidence but not been replaced withanything else. In the journal Energy and Environment (2005 Vol. 15, Issue 3/4) Benny115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Peiser, a visiting fellow at the University of Buckingham, observes that ‘there is nocompelling archaeological evidence for any of the key claims of societal dissolutionand breakdown before the 18th century.’ Once again, we return to the obligation ofproof. Without this, the claim that the moai were part of an ancestor cult that ended justprior to European contact as the Rapa Nui people descended into cannibalism to staveoff starvation struggles to find legitimacy. There is no evidence of cannibalism andplenty of evidence of the continuity of the moai-building custom, such as the unfinishedstatues still in the quarry.The population estimates of approximately 2,000 inhabitants at the time ofEuropean contact are derived from the best guess of the Dutch explorers during theirEaster Sunday visit. What is important to bear in mind is that the Dutch wereattempting to count a population they had just opened fire on, having shot dead about adozen of them following a misunderstanding between the Rapa Nui and the sailors.Counting fleeing or hiding natives when they have the home ground advantage isbound to lead to significant under-reporting.So that is no archaeological evidence of social collapse or cultural debasementand an under-reporting of a population at first contact that would then spend the nextcentury dying of Western diseases and being abducted by Peruvian and Europeanslave traders. By the time accurate records were made by the missionaries, RapaNui society really was in a state of collapse. The ‘decline’ hypothesis arose in the1970s and 1980s when the likes of Jared Diamond were attempting to sell theirracially problematic views of how cultures rise and fall. Shifting the blame from thecolonists to Rapa Nui itself provided a neat, hermetic ‘example’ of the theory. Pityabout the facts.As you might expect, the indigenous origin story is significantly different. One ofthe founders of the culture, King Hotu-Matua, came from the island of Hiva, which wassinking. However, Rapa Nui was already inhabited in some accounts. There were twogroups of people during the foundational days of the island: the Hanua Eepe, ‘long-eared,’ and the Hanua Momoku, ‘short-eared.’ According to Dr Schoch, someversions of these tales have the moai-building culture arriving with the Hanua Eepe,who also enslaved the Hanua Momoku until they one day rose up, cornered the ‘long-eared’ on one section of the island and killed them all.What is commonly left out of a reliance on the population estimates of the Dutchexplorers – and may have bearing on the suggestion there were two groups on theisland – is that they also recounted seeing living giants. In the exact words of theexplorer C. F. Behrens, ‘... with truth, I might say that these savages are all of more116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"fig. 9than gigantic size. The men are tall and broad in proportion, averaging 12 feet inheight. Surprising as it may appear, the tallest men on board of our ship could passbetween the legs of these children of Goliath without bending the head. The womencan not compare in stature with the men, as they are commonly not above 10 feethigh.’ It is frustrating that mainstream historians can trust the accuracy of one part oftheir account while completely dismissing the other.It does not come into the journey of this book but we should ourselves be slow todismiss these accounts. The Mound Builder culture of North and South Americaappears to be anything but a hoax, although it certainly was a cover-up. AbrahamLincoln even mentioned them in speeches. Rapa Nui would be precisely the sort ofplace you would expect to find a relict survival, just as the diminutive Homofloresiensis – a hominin I find even less plausible than giants but nevertheless existed– was found on the other side of the Pacific. Interestingly, early European accounts ofIndonesia speak of a living race of very small humans, so there may well have beenanother relict survival into the modern era within the western remains of the Sundaempire.Rapa Nui moaiRAPA NUI STAR LOREThe official dating of the arrival of the first humans at Rapa Nui – between 700CE and 1100 CE – is not based on any genetic data but exclusively on archaeologicalevidence. If Dr Schoch’s analysis of the island is even slightly correct, it is also based117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"on selective archaeological evidence, whilst ignoring the sedimentation around themoai and lack of granite quarries, as either of these would push the date back quitesignificantly. Another example of this selective evidence would be the reliance on achange from palm to grassland around 1200 CE – contiguous with the presumed firstarrival of the Polynesians – whilst ignoring the same palm-to-grassland change thatoccurs at 450 BCE.It may be the case that 100 CE was indeed when the first people arrived at RapaNui. The hypothesis that Polynesian cultures were the most likely to retain elementsof the Sunda and Sahul cosmologies remains in play. It is, however, considerablystrengthened if it transpires the islands have been, or were once, occupiedsignificantly earlier. The reason for this is Rapa Nuian star lore is astoundingly similarto the emergence of star lore with the first ‘civilisations’ of the Near East and Indiansubcontinent. It has the highest degree of ritual overlap out of anywhere in the Pacificwhich could be explained by using an earlier date of first settlement, contemporaneouswith the proposed influence on points west, after which point in time the Rapa Nuiansremained in the most splendid of isolations out of anywhere in Polynesia. We shallreturn to this suggestion following an analysis of their star lore.Rapa Nui provides the best example in the Pacific of the use of astronomy andstar lore for reasons other than navigation. It was home to a powerful priesthood whoused their knowledge of observation of the stars to set a yearly calendar of ritual anddomestic activities. Most of the information regarding the sacred astronomy of thispriesthood was collected in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, probablythe very last time any of these practices remained in living memory, and sometimesonly as remembrances of tales told by grandparents. In fact, a lot of the star lore layforgotten in dusty boxes in the Royal Geographic Society until 1983, when theunpublished field notes of ethnographer Katherine Routledge’s 1914–1919 studieswere located. She managed to find two elderly inhabitants who could allegedly readsome of the mysterious rongorongo script, although their description of the meaningsdiffers markedly.Carved onto wooden tablets and seemingly kept in the majority of Rapa Nuihomes, this script was only first discovered by Europeans in the 1860s, at which pointmissionary zeal led to the fiery destruction of most of them. Now only a few dozenremain and many of these are scattered across western museum collections. Thesetablets are a couple of centuries old and likely copies of earlier tablets or carvings.Currently undeciphered, the rongorongo glyphs repeat in a way that leads someresearchers to suggest they are or were sacred chants. But, as we shall see, there is118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"a good case to be made for suggesting these are depictions of stars and skyphenomena. One interpretation does not preclude the other, of course. Indeed, it seemslikely they are sacred chants of star lore, which is not at all without precedent acrossPolynesia.Some of the symbols are very similar to glyphs found on other Pacific islands,particularly in Hawaii and Micronesia. Quite suggestively, there is also a stylisticoverlap with the also undeciphered Indus script. If these similarities are anything otherthan accidental, then they may well point to a shared origin, perhaps even a Sundalandone. Even more intriguingly, Dr Schoch sees similarities with both the Nazca Linesand carvings found at Göbekli Tepe. For all of these to have a common origin, we areindeed back in the early days of Southeast Asian colonisation, which is the last timethe ancestors of all these cultures were in the one place.Returning to Katherine Routledge, she was told there were several classes ofastronomer priests, each trained to and then tasked with recording the movements ofspecific asterisms, principally Orion, the Pleiades and Sirius/Canis Major fromcertain ahu, or sacred platforms. Although the earliest interpretation of these ahu werethat they were aligned to solstices and equinoxes (western antiquarians having atendency to overemphasise the sun), it turns out that those that do have skyalignments are better matches for the rising of specific constellations. And it is thosewith stellar alignments that are the best constructed out of all the ahu. Caves andnatural rocks were also used as observation points. One promontory on the PoikePeninsula is called Papa ui hetu’u, ‘the rock for star-gazing.’ Near to the promontorywas a rock Routledge identified as having a cup hole ‘star map’ of the Pleiades. Cupholes are common in megalithic sites across Western Europe and also feature on thetops of the T-shaped pillars at Göbekli Tepe.Like we find in Western Polynesia, the Eastern Polynesian year began with therising of the Pleiades, called Matariki. However in the east, they are more explicitabout what this entails. During Matariki, the gods descended from the skyworld, ao, tomingle with humans in the realm of the living, called kainga.Matariki inaugurated the ‘bountiful season,’ called Hora Nui. Beginning at thispoint and proceeding through the year, the ritual marking of the annual cycle wascalled ‘the Work of the Gods.’ This calendar was lunar, rather than solar, which isanother overlap with early Indian culture. In order of importance, the preeminentasterisms and constellations should be familiar by now.Orion119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Orion has three separate names in Rapanui star lore. They are Tautoru, theThree Handsome Ones, which are the belt stars; E tui, ‘The Expelled,’ which is theconstellation itself; and Tau ahu, ‘Beautiful Firebrand,’ the name for Rigel and the wifeof one of the belt stars. Along with the Pleiades, Orion’s Belt was the most importantasterism.Immediately following the first lunar month of Hora Nui, marked by thePleiades’ arrival into the sky, was the lunar month of Ruti, where Orion’s Belt washigh in the sky and rituals were held to honour the chiefs and ancestors. The next threemonths deal principally with the location of the Pleiades and Orion’s Belt in the skyand their relationship to Mars, Canopus and other important stellar objects. The monthof Tara Hau, when the Pleiades disappeared beneath the horizon, signalled a time ofcalamity for man until the next Matariki festival in several months’ time. Again, this iscuriously redolent of Ancient Egypt.Other Important StarsOther stars, planets and constellations of significance recur. Chief among themare Sirius, Te pou o te rangi, the Post of the Sky; Canopus, Po roroa, the GreatDarkness, used in conjunction with Orion’s Belt to time the planting season; Mars,Matamea, Red Eye, observed from Routledge’s observatory on Poike and probablyconsidered a bad omen. Vega, Antares, Alpha Centauri, Beta Centauri, Venus andAldebaran were all named, tracked and calendarised in the ‘Work of the Gods.’Other Ritual ActivityTurmeric, which is native to southeast India, was made into a body paint calledrenga during the Matariki festival. Offerings of turmeric were also made to the highchief. If this is not an historical development – which is unlikely – then we are left towonder how a member of the Indian ginger family ended up on the most isolatedisland on earth, more than half a world away.Rapa Nui’s astronomer-priests were known as tohunga. The exact same wordin Maori means expert or wise man, equivalent to the Hawaiian kahuna. In NewZealand there were tohunga specialising in navigation, medicine, stars, canoe buildingand so on. On Rapa Nui, it was the tohunga who read the sacred chants of therongorongo script. According to what Katherine Routledge was told, these tohungalived in circular stone towers called tupa. The majority of these tupa are clustered inthe northern part of the island, where we also find ‘the rock for star-gazing’ and plentyof ahu. A 2010 Explorers Club Flag Expedition to Rapa Nui found that all but one of120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"these tupa had entranceways that were oriented to a star or asterism in some wayinvolved in the ‘Work of the Gods.’ It may be that measurements were taken when thestars appeared in the doorway or it may even have been a way of drawing down aparticular asterism into its tower. Again we immediately think of Egypt.GATHERING UP THE STARSWhat are we to make of Rapa Nui, then? It is apparently the last island inPolynesia to have been colonised, as recently as only a thousand or fifteen hundredyears ago. Yet it has geological, archaeological and potentially ritual evidence tosuggest activity in much earlier times. Rapa Nui may have been an outpost of theNusantao Maritime Trading Network that arose immediately after the end of the IceAge. Or it may have even been a holy island that was not permanently occupied andused as a sacred or holy site, both before and after this point. Perhaps it was acombination of sacred site and sailing stop-off point, never permanently occupied andvisited at intervals determined by the stars and the seasons, such as was the casewith Göbekli Tepe. One of the names for the island means ‘navel of the world,’ hintingit may have had a ritual value far in excess of its comparatively meagre resourcevalue.If such a scenario is accurate, it provides a ‘solve’ for the otherwise incongruousdata suggesting both very early and very late occupation: it was a site that was usedand known during a time when the sea levels were much lower, then it was abandonedor the original inhabitants died out. Then it was recolonised by the descendants ofthese first occupiers in the first millennium CE and some of the remaining megalithicinfrastructure, such as the basalt moai, were repurposed.Whatever the scenario, the island is the most challenging and most rewardingplace to look for where, in the words of Dr Oppenheimer that open this chapter,survivors of a sunken landmass may have ‘retained their original culture with the leastdilution.’Right across Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia we have the demonstrablecontinuity of Gondwana star lore being developed into a highly sophisticated form ofLaurasian astronomical knowledge used for navigation and the precise measurementof a ritual year. We find the Gondwana/Laurasia crossover of star lore in the same partof the world – Sunda and Sahul land – where linguistic evidence records the first risein cultural complexity since we left Africa, which also seems to have stepped,pyramidal hills built before the end of the Ice Age. This part of the world also hasgenetic, archaeological and potentially linguistic links to the ‘first cilivisations’ ofHarappa, Sumer and Egypt, as well as probably South America (although we are now121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"heading in the opposite direction).Over the last one hundred and fifty years, historians have looked for singular,linear answers: cities started here. The people next door learned from them and thenbuilt cities. Pyramids started there and then their neighbours copied the form. Thislinearity simply does not match what we now know about early human populationmovements or the ‘overlap analysis’ of world mythology that points to much, mucholder shared origins of specific gods and cosmologies. This book does not suggestthat all culture and civilisation came from the scattered survivors of Sundaland, settingout in ships to become the world’s wisdom teachers. It seems increasingly clear thatearly communities across Eurasia had hugely sophisticated cosmologies and evenarchitectural capacities by the end of the Ice Age, the original elements of which theymay have brought with them as human populations moved up into Eurasia and Europefrom South Asia during a brief warm period as the mtDNA evidence suggests. Instead,this book suggests that survivors of the sinking of Sunda and Sahul broughttechnological and magical techniques with them to populations across central andwestern Asia that were already in situ and likely even had vaguely recognisablepantheons and practices. It is also fairly likely that the Sunda survivors knew of thesescattered communities if the evidence for transoceanic and transcontinental trade isconsidered.Moving from Wendy Doniger’s microscope back to her telescope, we find in thestar lore of the Pacific a concept of divine kingship descending from the night sky, themagic of immortality and human origin associated with particular asterisms and thebelief that actions or architecture ‘below’ are in some way aligned with that which is‘above.’Even more than that, we have specific asterisms such as Orion and even godnames that recur in both description and magical function for the next five thousandyears. We can now posit that creating a map or replica with specific points in the nightsky, a concept we see executed throughout dynastic Egypt and continuing into thehermetic traditions of the Classical Age, seems to be a very long-lived one. Thedevelopment of this star map with ever more precision is, I believe, the ‘wisdom of thesages come down to us from a time before the Flood,’ as it is commonly described. Itgrew in a highly specific incubator: the interactions with the spirit world conducted bya culture or cultures of highly proficient open ocean navigators for whom precisionwas a literal matter of life and death. And the proof of their supreme competence is thevery fact of the existence of their descendants living on every piece of habitable land inthe Pacific, an ocean which covers half our planet’s surface.122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"It must have been quite an event to set these ancient Argonauts on such ajourney.123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"VIAh, Solon, Solon, you Greeks are ever children.HOW A WORLDENDSIt is the evening of August 28th, 1859. The night sky over London fills withincandescent, swirling light. Too far south, too bright and the wrong time of year to bethe Northern Lights, these displays are curiously humanoid, witnesses describe thedisplay as looking like couples performing a waltz.About forty hours earlier, an enormous coronal mass ejection (CME),accompanied by a solar proton event, erupted from the sun and tore through space inour direction. (Synchronicitists take note that it took seventeen hours to arrive.) Whenit reached the earth, this CME, in the form of a spiralling double helix, collapsed themagnetosphere, pushing our ‘magnetic shielding’ down to just seven thousandkilometres from its usual sixty five thousand. As the outpouring of plasma swirledaround and past our planet, its magnetic field pivoted so that it was opposite theEarth’s field, releasing enormous amounts of energy. It was this energy that generatedthe brilliant light show witnessed by Victorian Londoners.This is known today as the Carrington Event and whilst it is the largest suchCME of the previous few centuries, it is comparatively minor when viewed over alonger timeline of the last few hundred thousand years. The damage was limitedmostly to the telegraph system of the day, which was a mere two hundred thousandkilometres of cabling. Some telegraph operators found that they could operate theirequipment even when it was unplugged from its battery, other stations reportedstrange and garbled messages, yet more witnessed sparks flying from theirmachines. As a disquieting aside, a Carrington level event reaching the Earth today,for which we are overdue, would fry the nerve system of the entire planet. Replacing itwould take over a year. The death toll would climb into the millions, higher in thedeveloped world than the developing, as everything from modern farming techniques,food transportation and emergency services rely entirely on modern communication.Researchers such as Paul LaViolette have noticed the startling similaritybetween descriptions of the Carrington Event and humanoid petroglyphs from the124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Neolithic. There is much to recommend the suggestion that aberrant space weather isrecorded in some of the world’s earliest art and mythology. Even NASA has noted thatsome of the depictions on the ceiling of the Rouffignac Cave in France probablyrepresent auroras.Given what we know about the antiquity of certain mythemes – many of whichare significantly older than the end of the Ice Age – the question then becomes how weseparate out the ‘real’ from the ‘mythological’ when examining a climate event thatwas positively biblical.VAN DIEMEN’S LANDA few decades before the Carrington Event and on the other side of the world,George Augustus Robinson is committing that sort of helpful genocide in which theempire specialised. It is 1831 and he is on the east coast of Tasmania, rounding up thefew remaining Aborigines who have not fallen to disease or the settlers’ guns so thatthey can be resettled into reservations on some islands in the Bass Strait.The helpful Mr Robinson hears a story from the indigenous people. They tellhim that Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania) was once connected to New Holland (theAustralian mainland). Their ancestors had walked over and then the sea level hadrisen to where it is today. In Europe at the time, the closest thing the Academy had toan Ice Age theory was an explanation for the dispersal of rocks in the Alps that mayhave had something to do with glaciation. There was some speculation that perhapsthe polar ice caps had extended further down to the bottom of the temperate zones.Regardless, these were certainly not the circles that George Robinson moved in.Originally from London, he had first attempted to seek his fortune in Nicaragua,however the colony he had selected turned out to be a fraudulent enterprise. (This wasnot uncommon.) Tasmania was his second choice of location in which to strike it rich,and he left a wife and five children behind in order to do so. Greedy and drearilyreligious, he was not the type to commence a speculative geological investigationunder his own initiative, although his diaries certainly suggest he believed himselfcapable of doing so.To his credit, Robinson went this far: ‘For aught we know V.D.L. (Van Diemen’sLand) might at an early period have been joined to N.H. (New Holland) in which casethe tradition would be true.’ Almost two centuries later, we know the tradition is indeedtrue. Tasmania became an island fourteen thousand years ago, tens of millennia afterthe first Aborigines arrived there, cut off from the mainland by 200 kilometres ofunpredictable and extremely dangerous seas. If you are looking for evidence that theoral traditions of hunter gatherer societies can convey accurate historical information125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"then this is it. The native Tasmanians’ understanding of the geology of their homelandwas significantly more advanced than that of their technologically superior neighbours.George Robinson’s story is a very compelling proof of concept.Recent research into Indigenous Australian folklore has found additionalaccounts of the end of the Ice Age among tribes near modern day Melbourne,Kangaroo Island, Rottnest Island, Fitzroy Island and the Tiwi Islands. Quoted inScientific American, the University of New England’s Nicholas Reid said, ‘There areaspects of storytelling in Australia that involved kin-based responsibilities to tell thestories accurately. Cross-generational scaffolding can keep a story true.’THE FLOODThe modern world’s chronological understanding of time aligns poorly with howcultures previously viewed past events, which was largely either place-based or partof a wider mythology of group identity.This has led many an historian astray when he or she goes off looking for the‘real’ Noah’s Ark or some such thing. The error in this case is applying a modernliteralism to the location and dating of that particular iteration of the story which canonly ever be culture and location-specific. Consider the changing fashion styles ofJesus and Mary as they move across Europe over the centuries, getting whiter andwhiter until Mary ends up with the flowing red hair of the Celts, dressed as a memberof the French court. You are bound to be disappointed if you take this as your map andgo looking for first century Christians in North Wales, but this is what seekers afterNoah’s Ark are doing.Combining an understanding of geology with an awareness that mythology’sprimary purpose is cultural expression rather than scientific depiction, we cannevertheless construct, if not a map, then at least a key with which to interpret variousmaps.More than any other tableau, the Flood requires the most rigorous distributionalanalysis. There is a veritable deluge of flimsy pseudopsychological ‘explanations’ forthe prevalence of Flood myths around the planet, or in Witzel’s case, outrightdismissal because of a personal preference that in this particular case, mythologyshould not be capable of transmitting actual events. Other evidence-free suggestionsrange from metaphors for amniotic fluid and the birth process to the notion that theFlood represents the collective unconscious or the dream state. Again, suchexplanations require the stories to be randomly distributed, and they most certainlyare not. The next most common dismissal, as mentioned in a preceding chapter, is126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"that stories of global cataclysms are sometimes written off as a confusedexaggeration of local weather events by unsophisticated tribespeople. The researchinto the stories of the First Australians does not bear this out.With respect to the magical tradition and what may represent Palaeolithicsurvivals, the presence of non-randomly distributed flood stories – and who or whatmanaged to survive them – offers us the opportunity for some careful calibration.Because in the western tradition, the story of the Flood is intimately tied up, for betteror for worse, with the notion of ‘lost wisdom.’ None of this suggests that parts of theworld that were impacted less by the end of the Ice Age fail to demonstratePalaeolithic continuity, just that they may lack a definitive ‘mythic calibrator’ todetermine what happened before the end of the Ice Age and what happened afterward.Africa is the best example of this. It is the continent that suffered the least amount ofland loss at the end of the Ice Age and has probably the lowest number of indigenousflood myths relative to the number of local cultures. However, prior to the expansion ofthe Muslim and then northern European empires, African cultures, particularly in thesouth, were comparatively unmolested for hundreds of thousands of years. It seemsvery likely that many of the beliefs found here are Palaeolithic survivals. With fewerintervening ‘calibrating cataclysms,’ we have fewer opportunities to time stamp thesemyths.THE END OF THE ICE AGETransitioning out of the Pleistocene was not a single event. Beginning around12,000 BCE, the climate started to warm and much of the water locked up in glacialice began to melt. There followed a short cold spell known as the Younger Dryas, thenthe planet rapidly warmed again and we moved out of the ‘official’ Ice Age. Accordingto Greenland ice core data interpreted at the University of Copenhagen, this finalwarming could have happened in as short a time as three years.If we include the inundation of the Arabian Gulf that occurred around 6,000 BCE,however, we are looking at three separate and sudden sea level rises. These wereanything but gradual. The change in the pressure exerted on our squishy planet as icesheets melted or slipped off the land and into the ocean like ice cubes into a drinkcaused dramatic earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and superwaves of up to a mile high.Taking just one location as an example, the meltwater flowing from theCanadian ice sheet into the Arctic around 12,000 BCE is estimated by the Universityof Alberta’s Professor John Shaw at being 10 million cubic metres per second. Thisrate would drain Lake Ontario in less than four days. Staying in the same area, theLaurentide ice sheet spent centuries forming a giant lake as it gradually melted, which127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"was protected from the ocean by an enormous ice barrier. Around 6,000 BCE, thisbarrier melted and the lake poured through the Hudson Strait and into the ocean. Thevolume of water added to the world’s oceans from this event lifted the sea level byabout 20–40 centimetres instantly. In some parts of the world, once the resultingtsunamis were over, this event would have moved the shoreline dozens and dozens ofkilometres inland.The last two decades of geological research have yielded some very compellinginsights as to what was happening with the planet’s space weather while the sealevels were rising. Based on an analysis of Kilimanjaro ice cores, Dr Robert Schochexplains that during the period of 9,700 BCE to 6,000 BCE sunspot activity variedwidely. It was initially extremely active, then plunged to levels of very low activity, thenrose again. Although it is likely this solar activity had an impact on the dramaticclimate events occurring on earth, the mechanism for how and by how much is notcurrently clear. We can be extremely confident, however, that whilst our ancestorswere experiencing superwaves, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and dramaticchanges to their food supply, the sky would also periodically light up with the sort ofdancing figures that were witnessed over London during the Carrington Event. It wouldbe stranger if ancient mythologies didn’t include references to the most dramaticclimate upheavals hominins have ever experienced than if they did.SUNDALANDAs for the impact of the end of the Ice Age in the corner of the world that providesus with the most compelling genetic and linguistic evidence for Pleistocene culturalcomplexity? It would have been extreme. The Sunda Shelf, as the name implies, isquite flat. According to Dr Oppenheimer, the maximum horizontal distance between 20metre depth contours is almost 2,000 kilometres. When the sea came in, it went far,fast. Every ten centimetre sea level rise would push the water a kilometre inland,meaning the initial flood would have gone four kilometres inland in under two days.Here Dr Oppenheimer tactfully understates the drama of this catastrophe in Eden inthe East:We can imagine that the sea would not have come in quietly. Further fluctuationswould have resulted from rebound of the Earth’s crust relieved of a heavy load.The impact of these events on archaeological visibility is significant. Evidence ofcoastal or lowland settlement – where the majority of mankind has always lived –before 6,000 BCE is probably lost forever. In addition to this permanent horizon, thereis a secondary one as the sea levels actually rose above their present levels with the128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"final glacial melt and only settled back down in approximately 3,500 BCE. Hence thesurvivors of the first cataclysm who returned to the coast are under another silt level.It is tremendously significant that the resettling of the sea back to its presentlevel occurs at the same moment that twentieth century archaeologists considered the‘sudden beginnings of civilisation,’ particularly in the next two parts of the globe weshall examine as they both also suffered significant land loss. Indeed, it is that veryperiod between 6,000 BCE and 3,500 BCE that is the most confusing when it comes tothe study of civilisational emergence. The implications of the geology of the final sealevel rise is that the rise of ‘civilisation’ was anything but sudden and its antecedentsshould be sought under the silt. As for their antecedents, it is unlikely much of themwill ever be found.INDIAThe postcolonial toxicity that afflicts Indian history is probably nowhere moreevident than in its marine archaeology. It is evident that the coastline holds numerousunderwater settlements, both around the northern part of Sri Lanka and off the westerncoast of the mainland, where the Indus and Saraswati would once have drained intothe sea. The next largest amount of land lost to the ocean is off the coast of Bangladeshin the Bay of Bengal, which remains prone to flooding today. During the Boxing Daytsunami when the ocean receded by almost a mile, numerous submerged remainswere exposed to the air for the first time in thousands of years.Unfortunately, the political desire to declare India as the sole source of allsubsequent civilisations has led to some overly ambitious interpretations of themarine evidence. There are certainly manmade objects under the water, sometimesmiles off the coast of India and Sri Lanka, which by definition makes themantediluvian. However, to immediately leap to the conclusion that these remains areKrishna’s lost city of Dwarka or Kumari Kandam is to fall into the same trap asresearchers looking for Noah’s Ark or the ‘real’ Garden of Eden. By the time thesestories are being told they are separated by millennia from the geological events theymay be describing. We are talking about fuzzy memories rather than precision ones.Discernment is once again required in separating the archaeological facts fromtheir interpretation. Because the facts are quite clear. At its height, the Indus culturehad at least six cities of more than 30,000 residents, kiln-fired bricks requiringtemperatures of up to 1,700 degrees, and it appears with a fully formed script at thesame time as the final geological silt layer.

What role flooding has played in the story of the Sumerians, the peoplewho gave the west the majority of our flood myths, has been a cause of considerabledebate for more than a century.Now known as the Flandrian Transgression, the sea level overshoot actuallytook the ocean about 180 kilometres inland from where the Tigris and Euphratescurrently empty into the ocean. This transgression puts the shoreline right at the gateof the ancient city of Ur and within twenty five kilometres of the even older city ofEridu. It also made the settlements of the state of Lagash coastal. Just as is the case inSundaland, we are presented with an initial flood more than ten thousand years agothat turned the idyllic Arabian valley into the Arabian Gulf, then a second marineincursion that moved the shoreline further up the two main rivers, then, severalthousand years later, a final flood that initially moved the shore even further inlandbefore pulling back almost a hundred kilometres to its present position.Finding archaeological evidence above and below the resulting silt level hascaused no small level of confusion. Returning to Dr Oppenheimer:It was as if a curtain of water had been drawn across the remains of previouscoastal settlements. Pots and implements that allow archaeologists to defineprehistoric cultures were inaccessible; they lay under silt and under the sea,miles from the shoreline. But there was a window. Over the next few thousandyears the sea level settled back by up to 5 metres, and the coastline emergedagain, to a distance of over 100 kilometres. This partial drawing back of thecurtain allowed Woolley to peer under the silt layer, at the few hundred yearsafter the main force of the flood of Utnapishtim struck. Because marineinundation persisted from around 7500 to 5500 years ago on many of these sites,there was a big gap between the archaeological remains under the silt layer andthose above it.The Woolley he is referring to is Sir Leonard Woolley, the British Assyriologistand archaeologist known for his excavations at Ur, a man that history has been kind,then unkind and now slightly kind to once again. During his examination of the city ofUr, he encountered the silt layer that we now know was laid down by the Flandrian130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Transgression and declared two mostly wrong things. Firstly, that this was evidenceof the Old Testament Flood, which is wrong simply because the FlandrianTransgression postdates the earliest iteration of the Flood story that ultimately cameto be included in the Bible.Secondly, he declared that the silt was laid down by a marine flood, not ariverine flood. At the time, with Ur so far from the shoreline and being situated on ariver, he was widely mocked for his assertion. He even managed to calculate theheight of the ocean at the time as being about four metres above its present level. Inthis instance, we now know that Woolley was correct and his public detractors werewrong. Not only that, but his calculation of the sea level was admirably close to whatgeology has demonstrated. He simply lacked a mechanism to explain precisely whatthe ocean was doing there that did not rely on Scripture.A revised geological understanding has failed to disseminate publicly into widerAssyriology (although I have personally had some frank private discussions on thesubject with academics). Much of this may be down to the persistent stink ofchurchiness associated with using the ‘F’ word. As such, ‘Woolley’s Flood’ is stillconsidered to be riverine. The source of the confusion seems to be a lack ofunderstanding that a marine incursion up a river delta would lay down estuarine siltrather than marine silt anyway. Just think about how water would move upriver andform a ‘wall’ that would lead to the river depositing silt brought down from themountains at the new shoreline.Woolley was dismissed but he is the perfect example of ‘the story’ comingdown to us out of sequence, a concept we will return to again. There were actuallyseveral floods, the first and second of which would have left the earliest sitesunderneath today’s shoreline. The last of which took the ocean right up to Ur andEridu, flooding at least one of them, in 3,500 BCE, exactly when Sumerian civilisationbursts fully formed onto the scene, and coinciding with the story of the seven fishsages arriving from the east with the skills of high civilisation. Incidentally, although itis deeply unfashionable now thanks to its origins in a very racist period of Europeanexploration, evidence from the skulls of these first Sumerians demonstrates they werebrachycephalic, suggesting an eastern origin.The curious geography of Sumeria’s earliest period fits with the notion of themas coastal seafarers. It also makes it a near certainty that Sumeria’s ‘sudden’appearance in the archaeological record is illusory and that its earliest layers lie bothunder and across at least one ocean. In all likelihood, Eridu is not the oldest city,merely the oldest coastal city not destroyed by the invading sea. In other words, it may131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"be the last old city to be built at the post-glacial highwater point. Looking at theevidence for Eridu’s earliest layers, Dr Oppenheimer observes that the Ubaid peoplewho fashioned the oldest pottery found at Eridu also appear to have given both Eriduand Ur their names.’ He suspects, probably correctly, that the Ubaid people builtcoastal settlements which are now on or under the seabed of the Arabian Gulf.’Once the sea had rolled back and in the subsequent 1,500 years, the Sumerianand Babylonian civilisations climbed up the rivers of the Tigris and Euphrates, takingwith them the stories of the floods of Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh and eventually Noah.FIRE IN THE SKYThe cause or causes of Ice Ages are not even close to being fully understood.They certainly repeat, but they do so irregularly. This rules out some kind of solar‘superseason’ as a singular ‘cause.’ And the volcanic explanation – that ash blocks outthe sun for years at a time – would leave clearly discernable geological layers.Currently, the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis, out of Harvard, is thefrontrunning explanation for the snap cooling that preceded the end of the last Ice Age.Ice core data show a 100-fold increase in platinum concentrations 12,890 years ago,which align with oxygen isotope measurements indicating a sharp drop intemperature.It is believed that a large meteor hit the North American ice sheet, which couldhave killed 75% of the continent’s population, wiped out large mammals such as themammoth and changed oceanic circulation. Such an event would certainly go a longway to explaining the extremely rapid melting of some of the ice sheet. Rock scoringfound in Canada indicates large flows of liquid water rather than the movement ofglaciers. A large, burning space rock may account for this.More recently, however, David Meltzer of Southern Methodist University has re-examined the data from 29 American sites used to support the Impact Hypothesis andthe date ranges stretch a lot further on either side of the supposed meteor event. Thismakes it unlikely that the abrupt climate change was caused by a single event –always the preferred explanation of the academic. Once again, the facts remain andthe interpretation needs revising. And what the facts indicate is our ancestors livedthrough a few centuries of some fairly extreme space weather.Around 9,500 BCE, the sun was extremely active, with a record number ofsunspots. For the next 1,500 years, sunspot activity varied dramatically. Between8,800 BCE and around 6,000 BCE, activity continued to fluctuate, only with diminishing132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"highs. These fluctuations correlate, albeit imprecisely, with the climate changesassociated with the Dryas periods. Clearly there is some correlation between solaractivity, space debris and the end of the Ice Age.It is possible that the absence of definitive evidence is itself a form of evidence.Emerging from the global interest in climate research accompanying ourAnthropocene is a new appreciation for the impact of cosmic rays and solar activity inweather formation. Acidity spike data from the Cariaco Basin and dramatic increasesin nitrate ion concentration in ice core data from several sites around the world point tosome extreme coronal mass ejections around this time. Analysis of solar flare trackson the glassy surface of the point suggest the same thing; that solar flare activity hasvaried by a factor of more than fifty between the end of the Ice Age and now.Extreme space weather – perhaps caused by physical and electromagneticdebris travelling through the solar system – may even show up in more prosaicexplanations. A large gravitational wave, which can currently only be detectedindirectly, would trigger earthquakes and volcanoes on earth as it passed by andthrough the planet. Independent researcher Paul LaViolette points out that the day afterthe 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, the earth was hit by a major gamma ray burst from aneutron star located 50,000 light years away. The energy released by the flare fromthis distant star was greater than all the energy given off by the sun in the last hundredthousand years.Geologist Dr Robert Schoch, in Forgotten Civilisation, explains how the impactof such extreme events may have been experienced by our ancestors.LaViolette discusses some of the effects of a massive SPE and the attendantsolar activity for the Earth. The ozone layer, our protection from deadlyultraviolet (UV) rays, would have been greatly depleted, with major ozone holesforming in some areas, that is, if the ozone layer had not been destroyedcompletely! Increased doses of damaging, and potentially lethal, UV radiationcould have posed a major hazard for organisms on Earth, especially in high andmiddle latitudes. Besides the increased UV radiation, high-energy cosmic raysthat are part of a major SPE would penetrate the atmosphere and raise radiationlevels on the ground. According to LaViolette’s calculations, unprotectedorganisms at sea level during the event of ‘12,837 cal yrs BP,’ which is the focusof his paper, could have accumulated radiation doses of 3 to 6 Sieverts (a unit ofradiation exposure, 1 Sievert = 100 rems [an older unit of radiation doses]) overa period of two or three days. Lethal radiation doses for humans are in the rangeof about 3.5 Sieverts, and for many large mammals in the 3- to 8-Sievert range.133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The best mode of protection at the time, both from the UV radiation and thecosmic ray radiation, may have been to seek safety in caves and otherunderground shelters (Space Daily 2011; LaViolette 2005). Interestingly, Austrianarchaeologist and speleologist Heinrich Kusch and his wife Ingrid Kusch havedocumented hundreds upon hundreds of tunnel systems under Neolithicsettlements found throughout Europe and Turkey, some dating back to aroundtwelve thousand years ago (Kusch and Kusch 2011). According to HeinrichKusch, based on the number of tunnels that have survived to the present day, theoriginal extent of such tunnels must have been absolutely enormous! Accordingto him, many of the tunnels ‘are not much larger than big wormholes – just 70cm wide – just wide enough for a person to wriggle along but nothing else. Theyare interspersed with nooks, at some places it’s larger and there is seating, orstorage chambers and rooms. Taken together it is a massive undergroundnetwork’ (Heinrich Kusch, quoted in Austrian Times 2011; see also Daily Mail2011).We are thus presented with the curious situation of having three sources of data– mythological, archaeological and geological – each on their own qualifying ascircumstantial, but viewed collectively as something much more tantalising.It is worth considering some of the Sumerian mythological descriptors, as theypoint to climate events beyond a ‘mere’ change in sea level. In the Atrahasis telling ofthe Flood, not only are the pasturelands covered in white salt – suggestive of a seaincursion – but the resulting famine where families turn to eating their children isaccompanied by scabs appearing on the skin and mouths.Significantly, Atrahasis’s boat must be protected from the sun, and is thus fullysealed over. Enki even gives him a sand clock that lasts seven days so that he knowswhen to come back out. The Flood, when it came, was accompanied by an extremelyloud noise, darkening skies and a raging wind from Adad. Anzu tears at the sky withhis talons, breaking it and letting the flood in.

Thiswould not show up anywhere in the geological record and would throw huge amountsof water up into the atmosphere, which would necessarily have to come back down incontinuous heavy rainfall: forty days and forty nights of circumstantial evidence on acontinuous feedback loop.In his recent book, The Ark Before Noah, Dr Irving Finkel notes that all theanimals on board the earliest version of the ark were predomesticated. They werepart of a preagricultural culture’s food supply. At his book launch in London, I had theoccasion to ask him whether he thought that meant the Sumerian flood stories were acultural memory of the end of the Ice Age, a time before agriculture. His eyes widenedand he said that it was a huge issue that is probably worth us all thrashing out one day.Translating his response from the academic, that means yes, but I am not going to bethe first one to say it.ATLANTISInevitably, any discussion of the veracity of flood stories brings us back to thejewel in the western tradition’s flood crown: Atlantis itself. It has already been noted byvarious researchers over the last twenty years that the dates Solon was given for thetrue age of Egyptian civilisation line up not only with the geological age of the Sphinx(8,000 years old in the sixth century BCE) but also with the end of the Ice Age, andthus the most significant flood event we have experienced in twenty millennia.In light of the increasingly archaeological and geological visibility of thePalaeolithic and the Pleistocene, it is worth looking in more detail at what the priestsactually had to say about world-ending catastrophes.And then one of the priests, a very old man, said, ‘Ah, Solon, Solon, you Greeksare ever children. There isn’t an old man among you.’ On hearing this, Solonsaid, ‘What? What do you mean?’ ‘You are young,’ the old priest replied, ‘youngin soul, every one of you. Your souls are devoid of beliefs about antiquity handeddown by ancient tradition. Your souls lack any learning made hoary by time. The135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"reason for that is this: there have been, and there will continue to be, numerousdisasters that have destroyed human life in many kinds of ways. The mostserious of these involve fire and water, while the lesser ones have numerousother causes. And so also among your people the tale is told that Phaethon, childof the Sun, once harnessed his father’s chariot, but was unable to drive it alonghis father’s course. He ended up burning everything on the earth’s surface andwas destroyed himself when a lightning bolt struck him. This tale is told as amyth, but the truth behind it is that there is a deviation in the heavenly bodies thattravel around the earth, which causes huge fires that destroy what is on the earthacross vast stretches of time. When this happens all those people who live inmountains or in places that are high and dry are much more likely to perish thanthe ones who live next to rivers or by the sea. Our Nile, always our savior, isreleased and at such times, too, saves us from this disaster. On the other hand,whenever the gods send floods of water upon the earth to purge it, the herdsmenand shepherds in the mountains preserve their lives, while those who live incities, in your region, are swept by the rivers into the sea. But here, in this place,water does not flow from on high onto our fields, either at such a time or anyother. On the contrary, its nature is always to rise up from below. This, then,explains the fact that the antiquities preserved here are said to be the mostancient.Here we have further descriptions of extreme space weather in the form ofchariots of the gods, repeated destructions of mankind (in keeping with a dramaticseveral millennia), the burning up of humans on the earth and destruction with athunderbolt.We also see different mortality rates for different settlements, depending onwhat kind of calamity is afflicting mankind. In fact, the chilling image of bodies beingcarried downriver into the sea is also found in the Sumerian flood myths, where thewomb goddess accuses Enlil of cruelty for the genocide of his children: ‘Would a truefather have given rise to the rolling sea, so that [their bodies] could clog the river likedragon-flies?’ Returning to the Egyptian priest’s words to Solon in Timaeus:The truth is that in all places where neither inordinate cold nor heat prevent it,the human race will continue to exist, sometimes in greater, sometimes inlesser numbers. Now of all the events reported to us, no matter where they’veoccurred – in your parts or in ours – if there are any that are noble or great ordistinguished in some other way, they’ve all been inscribed here in our templesand preserved from antiquity on.136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"In your case, on the other hand, as in that of others, no sooner have youachieved literacy and all the other resources that cities require, than there again,after the usual number of years, comes the heavenly flood. It sweeps upon youlike a plague, and leaves only your illiterate and uncultured people behind. Youbecome infants all over again, as it were, completely unfamiliar with anythingthere was in ancient times, whether here or in your own region.Again, I find the alignments with human population and distribution estimateswith the description of ‘summer and winter’ highly suggestive. To me it speaks ofparts of the earth opened and closed by ice and sea, as well as dramatic changes tograsslands that were quick enough to snap-freeze mammoth with their mouths stillfull of wild flowers.As for what is preserved across cataclysms and how, we shall certainly returnto that. You are invited to consider ‘the heavenly flood ... like a plague’ in light of theradiational impact of a presumed solar particle event.And so, Solon, the account you just gave of your people’s lineage is just like anursery tale. First of all, you people remember only one flood, though in factthere had been a great many before. Second, you are unaware of the fact that thefinest and best of all the races of humankind once lived in your region. This isthe race from whom you yourself, your whole city, all that you and yourcountrymen have today, are sprung, thanks to the survival of a small portion oftheir stock. But this has escaped you, because for many generations thesurvivors passed on without leaving a written record.Again, this description of the origin of the Greeks is significant because it isexactly correct. The last twenty years of genetic research have revealed a migrationfrom the Levant and Anatolia out into the Mediterranean around 8,000 BCE, followedby another two millennia of ‘sloshing around’ from Greece to Malta to Menorca to Italyand back. It is likely these migrants were the ‘Ur’ culture for the Greeks andEtruscans, as well as being the people who would subsequently introduce more‘Eastern’ ideas into the Celtic tribes.The location and timing of this migration puts it exactly where and when theGöbekli Tepe culture was winding up. Thus it is both the origin of einkorn wheatagriculture, used by the Etruscans; and viticulture, used by everybody. (The presenceof an ecstatic god of meat-eating, drug-taking and wine who hails from a foreign hilltopand is associated with the mystery of agricultural renewal should be ringing a fewbells about now.)137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Inevitably, it seems, the Atlantologists have missed a trick. We have all beenlooking for the physical location of a political metaphor – whose existence is the leastinteresting part of the story – rather than calibrating the parts of the legend we canactually fix to some observable facts. Because what is so compelling about theAtlantis story is that it appears to be an example of Ice Age stories surviving all theway up to the sixth century BCE with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Theimplications for what else may have survived long enough to be able to impact theformulation of the western magical tradition are wide-reaching.THAT WHICH IS IMPERISHABLEOut of the disasters associated with the end of the Ice Age came stories ofgiants, little people, angels and refugee wisdom teachers dedicated to rebuildingcivilisation. The Flood is the pivotal event in the western mystery tradition, and I meanpivotal literally. Pinning it down finally provides us with a fixed location from which toview what came before and what came after.The default ‘alternative historical’ explanation for how the various sites aroundthe world appear to encode astronomical and mathematical information is that theyare in some sense a ‘warning’ for future generations about what has happened andwhat will presumably happen again. These hypotheses strike me as quite weak. Youwill struggle to find instances in the historical record for times when mankind gaveeven the slightest shit about our children and grandchildren. Most of the time, we areeither raping them ourselves or packing them off as sex slaves in politically expedientmarriages to nearby warlords. Today we cannot even manage to keep the planetliveable for the next two generations.It is a fundamental misreading of eschatology to assume we are concerned withthe survival of humans rather than wisdom. Either given freely or torn from the handsof uncaring gods, it is the technology for immortality that must survive. That is a near-universal Laurasian refrain.Thus it is more appropriate to consider these sacred sites as expressions of thatwhich is imperishable, rather than the imperishable things themselves. In any case, itis frankly bad magic to think merely building a temple out of stone will enable it tosurvive cataclysms. You only need to spend an hour or so on YouTube looking at theimpact of a recent tsunami on the world’s most technologically advanced civilisationto see that it is a recipe for heartache.

If somegrand measurement and ordering of the Continent was attempted, there musthave been a coordinating body or at least an efficient sharing of scientificsecrets, and there are few signs of this in the unpromising debris of hill forts andfarmsteads ...If no means of determining longitude was devised before Hipparchos, howdid Hannibal, for instance, manage to navigate his way along the Herakleandiagonal, and how was he able to rejoin the solar path after being forced todeviate from it? How could the pathways of the Celts have been anything but awonderful mirage? A clue can be found, surprisingly, in Pliny the Elder’scredulous encyclopaedia of wonders, Historia Naturalis (c. 78 AD). In a chapterwhich is bizarre even by Pliny’s standards, he describes two ancient‘experiments,’ the purpose and result of which escaped him almost entirely. Heknew only that they had something to do with the curvature of the earth, which‘discovers and hides some things to some, and others to others.’ Someone hadevidently tried to explain to Pliny the problem of longitude.It seems that with each new season, the earliest dates for megalithic structuresin Western Europe get pushed back another millennia or so. The vast majority of themare postdiluvian, but at least some of the sites now look to be antediluvian in the senseof first being used before the end of the Ice Age. (And there may well be more underthe cold waters off Britain’s northeast coast.)Consider the fascinating story of what we now call the Megalithic Yard. In a fineexample of relentlessness, an Oxford professor of engineering science, AlexanderThom, ruined nearly fifty of his wife and friends’ summers by packing them off all overBrittany and the British Isles, measuring megalithic sites, year after year. By the end ofhis life, he had built a database of megalithic measurements that has yet to besurpassed today. He claimed to have discovered three units of ancient measurementthat he called the Megalithic Yard (2.722 ft), the Megalithic Rod (2.5 MY) and aMegalithic Inch (one fortieth of a MY).Obviously this did not go down well – and has not gone down well – withhistorians whose theories do not match the statistical facts found by an actualprofessor of engineering. How could a preliterate society create a unified system of139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"measurement across so diverse a terrain?Easily, it turns out. All you need is time, which our ancestors certainly had. Youcould ball up some dung on a horse hair, create a pendulum and end up with anaccurate measurement for both the circumference of the earth and the moon. FromChristopher Knight and Alan Butler’s Before the Pyramids:We think it is fair to suggest that the first machine ever invented by man was theplumb-bob/pendulum. A small ball of clay on the end of a piece of twine or longstrand of straight hair is a wonderful device that interacts with the Earth in a verypredictable way. Held stationary, it will always point down to the centre of theplanet, which allows the user to check verticals during construction of any sort.Verticals are also necessary for good observational astronomy. When the deviceis swung gently to and fro in the hand it becomes a timekeeper, like a modernmetronome (which is only an inverted pendulum).But the real beauty about pendulums is that their frequency with whichthey swing is only determined by their length, so if you count a set number ofbeats for a given period of time (such as the period it takes a star to traverse aknown gap), you will always end up with the same pendulum length.We found that half a Megalithic Yard pendulum was the origin of the wholemeasurement system rediscovered by Thom.With a few bits of wood and twine, an ancient engineer could confidentlycalculate the circumference of the earth. He or she would face east and observe therising of a star or planet and then observe where they descended over an artificialhorizon like the top of a henge or part of an observational platform, counting pendulumswings between the rising and the setting of these astral bodies. When ChristopherKnight ran his suggestions by a chartered civil engineer by the name of Jim Russell,this is the response he got:If I wanted to study the movement of the planets and stars without moderninstruments, I would need a fixed point from which to make measurements. Iwould need middle distance reference points to check the star and planetmovements against an artificial horizon. Ideally I would be within shoutingdistance of my assistant placing the reference points 360 (or 366) degreesaround my reference point (right a bit, left a bit, SPOT ON).These hypothetical descriptions are highly resonant with the mysterious‘Stretching of the Cord’ ceremony that the Egyptian king and priestess of Seshat were140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"required to perform in the laying out of pyramids, the astronomical alignments ofwhich have boggled our minds for thousands of years. We are approaching a solutionto the observable fact that the dimensions of the earth are encoded in the constructionof the Great Pyramid without recourse to alien space ships. One final quote fromChristopher Knight on that subject.Neolithic sky-watchers would clearly have understood that there were twoconstantly repeating patterns taking place – the day and the year. It is almostimpossible that they would have failed to realize that the daily pattern fitted intothe yearly pattern 366 times. As far as they were concerned, the year was agreat circle of 366 days in duration and so the origin of the degree of arc as1/366th of a circle. By contrast, the modern convention of 360° in a circle is asprimitive as the ancient Egyptian year of 360 days – it simply isn’t correct. Thetwo errors are entirely historically related, and though we now do at least use ayear of 365 days, we never corrected the mistake regarding the number ofdegrees in a circle ...The ancient system of geometry has greatness running right through it. Itdivided the Earth’s polar circumference into 366° and then subdivided eachdegree into 60 minutes of an arc, with 6 seconds to each minute. And,amazingly, each second of the arc is exactly 366 MY in length.To sum up, count 366 swings of a pendulum between the rising and setting of,say, Venus, between two artificial markers and the length of your pendulum is half aMegalithic Yard. 366 is the number of days in an ancient year and the number ofdegrees in an ancient circle. The unit of measurement you have created can also beused to calculate the circumference of the Earth, because 366 Megalithic Yards isexactly one second of its arc. This same number, 366 Megalithic Yards, is preciselyequivalent to 1,000 Minoan Yards. As for the Egyptians, if you create a circle that has acircumference of one Megalithic Yard, then this circle has a diameter of one royalcubit. And the remen, an ancient Egyptian unit of measurement for land and roads, isthe hypotenuse of a square around the Megalithic Yard circle.Squaring the circle. Imagine that. If you are as confused as Pliny about now, donot worry. The point is that there is a universal unit of length found in Minoan Crete, theearliest architecture of Ancient Egypt and Northwest European megaliths that candeliver an accurate measurement of the earth using some clay, twine and a fewmagical friends. It is a mathematical impossibility that this exact unit of measurementwas arrived at randomly by at least three separate cultures and that they alsoaccidentally calculated the true circumference of the Earth.141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"fig. 10The relationship between theMegalithic Yard and the EgyptianremenChristopher Knight’s subsequent explanation for this, that colonists from theBritish Isles may have influenced the culture development of the Minoans andEgyptians lacks mythological or genetic support. Nevertheless, that is merely aninterpretation. His mathematical facts are sound. Given the available genetic andcultural data, it seems more likely to me that we need to ‘step up’ the family tree andlook for a common origin for these measurements.The time-depth for a common origin of megalithic measurements puts ussquarely back before the end of the Ice Age and is very likely a form of Laurasian ‘highmagical technology.’ Appearing at the very latest just after the end of the Ice Age – andthus by definition having been developed during it – we perceive a way of viewing theuniverse that links the number of days in a year to the number of swings of apendulum, to the layout of sacred sites, to the circumference of the earth and all tiedback to the movements of the stars.

However, postdiluvial migration – forwhich we have genetic, cultural and linguistic evidence – need not be a mass activity.To posit connections between Island Southeast Asia and the appearance of theSumerian and Harappan civilisations is not to imply that the Sunda survivors loadedthemselves onto fleets of ships and then set off for points west, populating the empty orunknown lands of the subcontinent and the Near East. Indeed, we saw that the majorityof survivors largely stayed in Melanesia for the next few thousand years beforepermanently inhabiting the rest of the Pacific.Cultures already existed in the lands that would become India, Pakistan andArabia prior to the dramatic technological and cultural changes that we are told aroseindependently, simultaneously and within a few centuries of the post-Ice Age climatesta-bilisation.

The same annual monsoon action that broughtthe Nusantao backwards and forwards from Southeast Asia enabled regular, sustainedcontact from India’s southernmost tip to the Horn of Africa, up the Arabian Gulf andright along the coastlines in between.Broadly speaking, we have the Dravidian/Tamil language and cultural groups inSouthern India and Sri Lanka, who have genetic and linguistic connections to South-east Asia on the eastern side and genetic and (reconstructed) linguistic relationshipsto the Horn of Africa and Southwestern Iran to the west. These groups have a lowgenetic correlation to the upper reaches of the Indus Valley, where we first seeevidence of the Harappan civilisation. There is effectively zero genetic correlationbetween Dravidian groups and Central Asia at the time depth we are looking at, andonly a small correlation between Central Asia and the proto-Harappans (sending theAryan Invasion Theory packing). The Sumerians have morphological connections toboth South India and Southeast Asia (as well as the expected Semitic and Africanmorphologies) but possess a language that is entirely unrelated to anything nearby,with the exception of Elamo-Dravidian (from Southwest Iran). Elamo-Dravidian,however, is currently only a hypothetical, reconstructed language.

Mercifully, we do not need to rebuild it. It is sufficient for our purposes that thereare multiple hard scientific data demonstrating contact before and after the end of theIce Age. This enables us to examine the star lore of these areas, whether they overlapand whether – as well as when – they demonstrate increasing complexity.INDIA145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"When it comes to the origins of the ‘Vedic civilisation’ and whether it originatedin India or somewhere else in Central Asia, I simply do not have a dog in thatparticular fight. Nor is it overly relevant to an examination of mythological vectorsacross cultures. Its age, rather than its provenance, is what is important here. It isnevertheless worth noting that every single event described in the Vedas happensinside India, which would be unusual choice of setting for an imported mythology.(Although not entirely without precedent.) Regardless, dating an oral tradition bysimply guessing it is a thousand years older than the first appearance of it in writtenform – which neatly summarises the official position – is highly dubious, particularlywhen the oral tradition shares so much symbolism with a culture, the Harappancivilisation, that was apparently entirely separate and ended a scant few centuriesbefore the oral tradition began; especially when this so-called Vedic civilisation iscurrently missing a homeland. (Dr Witzel puts it in Bactria. I ask for actual evidenceof that.) The whole thing becomes even more dubious now that we have evidence ofthe longevity and fidelity of oral traditions stretching over millennia from Australia andMelanesia. It seems much more likely that it is an older, indigenous mythologicaltradition that arose in a culture that had a high level of foreign contact, which we knowto be the case from the available genetic and cultural evidence.When condensed into a single sentence, the official narrative looks rather flimsy,bordering on the absurd: some chariot-riding people we have never found, whosehomeland is still missing, who are absent from the genetic record, created thesehunting and fire worship hymns no earlier than 2,000 BCE and probably by 1,400 BCEsomewhere in greater Punjab or a bit beyond. As mentioned, this puts its creationwithin a scant few centuries of the end of the Harappan civilisation to which it isapparently unrelated. But we also have no idea what language the Harappan culturespoke, nor have we deciphered their script, but it also definitely has nothing to do withthe more northern Vedic language or the Dravidian language to the south.The whole thing is a mess. A mess that tidies itself up considerably when youmatch the various motifs, flora and fauna mentioned in the hymns to the changinglandscape of South Asia. The Vedas appear as the very end of a long oral traditionrather than the beginning of a written one.The Gondwana/Laurasia model makes it clear that there was a sizeable overlapof cosmologies across vast land (and sea) areas. This reduces the Edwardianarchaeological need to find the X on the map. Given the timeframes under discussion,it is only to be expected that the flora and fauna of the hymns would change. A pictureof an oral, shamanic, Laurasian tradition changing over time emerges; changing bothbiospherically and linguistically.146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"••••EURASIA AFTER THE FLOODWhen the early Indologists declared that the flora and fauna in the Vedas – thelack of tigers in the earliest hymns, for instance – made it unlikely they werecomposed in India, they were largely unaware of the biospherical changes the humansliving in Eurasia had already been through, especially considering that central andsouthern Eurasia had been occupied for 30,000 to 40,000 years. Viewed over such along timeline, the changes to the local ecosystem resemble nothing quite so much aswatching the film Baraka speeded up.DURING THE ICE AGE: Central Asia and Northwest India was a dry desertsteppe, broadly similar to what we might find today in Mongolia.IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ICE AGE: Between 9,000 BCE and 8,000 BCE,increased rainfall and global temperatures brought dense birch forests to theseregions, closely followed by oak (mentioned in the Rig Veda). Southern India didnot experience much of a climate change, perhaps only 1 degree, so the sameconditions for flora and fauna continued.6,000 BCE – 3,000 BCE: The western coast of the Black Sea – where todaythere are forests – was steppe. The eastern coast – which is today steppe – wasforest. The coasts switched to their ‘modern’ configuration by 3,000 BCE. In theAltai region (Kazakhstan, Mongolia), the steppe became dense conifer forest at6,000 BCE. In northern India, willow, juniper and oak appeared on the Kachiplain. Lake levels rose early during this period and then gradually receded.2,000 BCE: By this point, the forests had long left the northern steppe of CentralAsia, the southern steppe had become dry, northwest India was slightly coolerthan it was today but otherwise largely resembled today’s climate, as did theentire Eurasian continent.If Dr Witzel’s timeline and geographic reach for Laurasian cosmologies arebroadly accurate, that suggests that these climate changes were absorbed into anexisting belief system, rather than being a crude reaction to local conditions. To put itanother way, the same creator god was called upon in the dense conifer forests aswas called upon out on the reappearing steppe.Once again, recourse to hard scientific data sheds surprising new light on thedevelopment and transmission of mythology. In The Origins of the World’sMythologies, Witzel observes in passing – and misses the potential significance of –that, in between the Last Glacial Maximum and the end of the Ice Age, there was a147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"grassland corridor running southeast to northwest across India up toward the NearEast. To the east of this corridor there would have been marshy, predator-infestedjungles and to the west there would have been impenetrable, snow-coveredmountains. So there was an actual highway between our previous point of interest,Sundaland, and our current one, the top of the Indus.CALIBRATING THE VEDASIn the absence of any credible evidence that the Vedas were wholly foreign toIndia and first created at the very young date of 1500 BCE by a people for whom wehave zero genetic evidence and who are currently missing a homeland, it seems thatcalibrating the hymns with what we know of the flora and fauna described in them mayshed some light on their true age.What is important to realise from the outset is that they were not all writtendown at the same time. First came the Rig Veda, then the Yajur Veda, then the SamaVeda and finally the Atharva Veda. The prevailing theory is that these four texts wereall written down within a couple of centuries of each other. However, these timelinesare in stark contrast to the dramatic changes in landscape, farming, clothing andtechnology described in the various hymns. If they were transcribed so close to eachother, then not only are we missing their home culture, we should be looking for onethat underwent the kind of changes the western world experienced over the lastcentury. Quite simply, the numbers do not stack up.Instead, we should consider that, as oral texts, the Vedas are a highlyconservative form of cultural storage and are thus likely to have retained ‘memories’of ancient climates and experiences, just as we saw with the Australian Aborigines.The following examples of possible calibration owe a great deal to the work ofDr Premendra Priyadarshi, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburghand – man after my own heart – an independent researcher with a mind for hardscience. His excellent In Quest of the Dates of the Vedas is highly recommended foranyone with an interest in the origins of Indo-European mythology. We move from theoldest to the newest of the hymn collections.Rig VedaThe earliest of the Vedas does not mention wheat, rice, lentils or date palms,which is surprising given that any hypothetical Aryan hymn singer would be familiarwith all of them. It would be unsurprising if these hymns represent the oral tradition ofpreagricultural nomads such as one might find before or at the very end of the Ice Age.148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Cold climate trees such as the oak, long extinct by the proposed period of Aryaninfluence of 2,000 BCE to 1,500 BCE, do warrant a mention.Somewhat famously, the Rig Veda does describe the mighty Saraswati River –extinct for four thousand years – in full flow. The Saraswati lost its connection to theHimalayan glaciers around 7,000 BCE and gradually declined to a trickle before finallydying around 2,000 BCE, before the accepted date for the codification of the hymnsthemselves. She is described as both a mighty river and a goddess in the Rig Veda,but by the time of the youngest hymn collection, the Atharva Veda, she is described‘only’ as a goddess.Staying with the liquid theme, water wheels are mentioned as being in use,suggesting that the water table in northwest India was significantly higher at the time,such as one would expect in a landscape of roaring glacial rivers. The beaver is notmentioned in the Rig Veda, but it is mentioned in the next-oldest collection, the YajurVeda. Beavers cannot survive in fast-flowing rivers, nor are they particularly welldisposed to grasslands. They would, and indeed did, prefer the post-5,000 BCEclimate, when the landscape was covered in dense poplar forests, perfect for buildingdams on the slowing Saraswati. The beaver became extinct in this area by 2,000BCE, again before the accepted date for the earliest Vedic text. The creature is notmentioned again after the Yajur Veda.The Rig Veda mentions lions, wild horses, wild camels and leopards, allconsistent with an open grassland environment. It does not mention the tiger, therhinoceros, the tortoise or the crocodile, which would have been absent from such anenvironment.Of particular interest is that, unlike later Vedas, the Rig Veda makes no mentionof seals, writing, pens or styluses, statues or burnt brick, all of which are present inHarappan culture, which supposedly predates it. Had the Rig Veda been composedaround 2,000 BCE – by whomever you wish to presume did so – this would have beenthousands of years after the introduction of such technology right across Eurasia andwould presumably have made it into at least one hymn. It makes more sense topropose, as Dr Priyadarshi does, that the Rig Veda come down to us from a timebefore any of these things.There are other technological suggestions that this may be the case. The RigVeda makes no mention of cotton. Cotton trees are mentioned in the Yajur Veda and theHarappans, again apparently older than Vedic civilisation, wore cotton clothing. It does,however, mention wool, a far more suitable material for clothing in a land of glacialrivers and mountain passes. Recall that the sheep, an Indian animal, was introduced149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"to Northeast Africa by 6,000 BCE.Interestingly, Dr Priyadarshi suggests the preeminence of the fire god, Agni, inthe Rig Veda above the other Vedas, would be in keeping with a culture living in a coldclimate rather than a warm one. That is certainly food for thought.Yajur VedaDr Priyadarshi suggests that the Rig Veda was composed between 6,000 BCEto 5,500 BCE. After this time, the climate went from dry/cold to warm/wet which,inevitably, matches the second-oldest of the Vedas, the Yajur Veda. We see mentionsof the monsoon as well as evidence for settled agriculture such as wheat, rice, lentiland date palm. This would be in keeping with the arrival of farming to northwest Indiain the early Holocene, a time of much higher rainfall. The rainfall was lower than todaybut the postglacial rivers were in full flow. Combined with the warmer climate, this isgreat farming weather. The era is known as either the Early Harappa or MehrgarhPeriod II.There are no burnt bricks in Mehrgarh Period I, just as there are no burnt bricksin the Rig Veda. By contrast, the Yajur Veda describes and also implies the extensiveuse of burnt bricks. Indeed, burnt bricks – mysteriously fired at temperatures so higharchaeologists do not yet know how they accomplished it – is characteristic of HighHarappan and Indus culture, beginning in earnest during Mehrgarh Period II. The YajurVeda specifically pays homage to social classes such as sewer workers who tenddrainage pipes, roads and other cultures constructed out of burnt brick. In point of fact,it is one of the most adored objects in the entire text. Combined with the climate dataand the references to agriculture, the presence of burnt brick in the Yajur Vedasuggests a composition date no earlier than 5,500 BCE and probably slightly after that.Amulets, not mentioned in the Rig Veda, make their first appearance in the YajurVeda and, as we know, Harappan civilisation was positively awash with the things. Wealso see the first mention of writing, another Harappan feature.The water wheel is absent but the potter’s wheel makes its first appearancehere, too. The potter’s wheel appears in the archaeological record of the region duringthe Mehrgarh Period II. You will not find anywhere in Eurasia where the potter’s wheelis absent by 1,500 BCE, the currently accepted dating of the composition of the Vedas.So its absence from the Rig Veda, if it was composed at such a late date, is unusual tosay the least.Two agricultural products appear in the hymns for the first time that may be150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"highly significant in correlating Harappa with both a Sunda influence and a Sumerianinfluence. Rice, which locates its genetic origin and first evidence of cultivation inisland Southeast Asia, gets its first mention. That could suggest not only a change inclimate making the cultivation of rice possible but also, given the broad timelinematch, a diffusion of rice growing techniques from the southeast to the northwest.Mehrgargh Period II, with its burnt bricks and potters’ wheels and so on, was a time ofhigh cultural complexity which may be due in part to outside influence.The second agricultural product worth noting that makes its first appearance inthe Yajur Veda is sesame, both in wild and cultivated form. Not mentioned in the RigVeda, sesame oil became an important component of Vedic rituals. The sesame plantis summer-flowering and requires warm weather, likely originating in southern India.In fact, the Dravidian word for sesame, ellu, was borrowed into the Sumerian andAkkadian, and became our word ‘oil.’ Burnt sesame seeds have been found in Indussites dating back 3,500 BCE. Much like the appearance of the Austronesian words for‘cinnamon’ and ‘lemon’ in ancient India, the use of the same word for the samesubstance stretching from the Dravidian region, through the Indus region and intoSumeria is compelling evidence for very early contact.Sama Veda and Atharva VedaEven working to Dr Priyadarshi’s extended timeline for the first composition ofthe Vedas, by the time we get to the youngest two, we are firmly within the acceptedera for Mid or Late Harappa. Fascinating though these texts are in their own right, theycannot tell us much regarding potential Palaeolithic survivals.INDIAN STAR LOREA curious thing happens when you map the early Vedas to the climate changesassociated with the end of the Ice Age. You begin to see their star lore in a new light,but also a new context. For instance, the prominence of a lunar calendar rather than asolar one takes on additional context when you see the same calendrical systemshowing up among the Sunda survivors of Melanesia and Polynesia. Jake Stratton-Kent notes in his books that there is considerable academic debate as to whether thelunar calendar (and thus eventually the lunar mansions and decans) originated ineither China or Babylon. Given that it also shows up in near identical form acrossPolynesia and, as we are about to see, is evident in the Vedas, we are forced todeclare both sides wrong and posit an ultimate origin considerably earlier than 1,000BCE. Otherwise this calendrical technology is unable to influence such geographicallydisparate cultures. They are looking for parents and actually finding siblings. The lunarcalendar is clearly older, emerging from cultures that – being pre- or non-agricultural151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"– had little use for the sun. It is also easier to visually track the movement of the moonthrough its mansions because you can actually look at it.Luni-Solar CalendarA substantial minority of scholars believe that India derived its astrological andcalendrical system from Mesopotamia. Evidence marshalled for this position is theBabylonian Mul.Apin Text from around 1,000 BCE. Like the Rig Veda, Mul.Apin has360 days/720 ‘day and night moments’ as well as an intercalary thirteenth monthevery five years to reset the calendar.The trouble is 1,000 BCE is much, much too late in the story if it turns out theRig Veda describes an oral tradition going back to at least the end of the Ice Age. Anidentical calendar is found in Polynesia, China, Egypt and Sumeria, suggesting itsorigin in the original Proto-Laurasian culture of Sundaland. There is also the notinsignificant observation that Mul.Apin is principally concerned with the movement ofthe planets (it is Babylonian, after all) and the planets are of passing importance inVedic star lore, just as they are in Polynesia and among the Torres Strait Islanders.(Planetary astrology achieved its high importance during the Hindu era.) If the starlore of the western esoteric tradition derives from a Palaeolithic navigational culture,and I believe it does, then we can expect that the oldest versions of this astrologicaltech will place greater emphasis on the stars than the planets.Two Rig Vedic hymns following on from each other describe the ‘twelve fixedparts of the wheel’ in context of the sun, followed by a description of the twelve placesof the moon, with a mention of the intercalary ‘hidden’ month. Another hymn to theAshvins – who some have interpreted as Mercury and Venus given their status aswandering sunrise/sunset horsemen – is probably the earliest description of thetwelve zodiacal signs (particularly if the Rig Veda is as old as its floral and faunaldescriptions suggest).The system of lunar asterisms in Mul.Apin, clearly derived from the Sumerian‘three star lists,’ is very similar to the nakshatra system referred to in the Rig Vedaand described in much more detail in the Atharva Veda. There were presumably 24nakshatras – one for each half month – but three of them were split again to align themansions with lunar sidereal months, bringing the total number to 27. The nakshatrasystem is potentially highly illuminating when it comes to the origin and true antiquityof the western esoteric tradition. Each nakshatra had a presiding deity and formed acounter-balancing pair with the nakshatra found 180 degrees away in the oppositecorner of the sky, much as we find in the decans. (Yes, 27 is an odd number. There is a28th, or hidden nakshatra called Sati, who was not invited to Shiva’s self-sacrifice by152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"drinking celestial poison and thus returned to the ‘normal’ part of the night sky. Fudgingthe books is an ancient practice.)PleiadesDid you think we were done with the seven sisters? Perish the thought. Just aswe find in Polynesia, the year begins with the heliacal rising of the Krittikas in the east.However, thanks to the impact of precession, it seems highly likely the Pleiades werespiritually significant long before taking up position in the eastern corner of the dawnsky, which would be in keeping with the proposed true age of the Rig Veda.Dr B. G. Sidharth, an astronomer with some thirty years’ experience anddirector of India’s B. M. Birla Science Centre has matched mentions of the skylocation of different asterisms in the Vedas to when they last occupied said locationsand come up with a date of 7,300 BCE for the Vedic age. In his fascinating book, TheCelestial Key to the Vedas, he avers these hymns describe a continuous system ofastronomical observation going back to 7,300 BCE and beyond, rather than a systemformed at such an early date that was subsequently passed down. His description of acorpus of star lore growing in sophistication is in almost perfect agreement with DrPriyadarshi’s mapping of the changing flora, fauna and technology found in the RigVeda and the Yajur Veda.Dr Sidharth draws our attention to a Rig Vedic hymn in which Prajapati, the year,begins with the nakshatra Rohini rising at the winter solstice at the same time Antaresrose at the summer solstice and the nakshatra Purva Bhadrapada rose with theautumnal equinox. For all these conditions to be met, we are looking at 10,000 BCE,mid-point of Dr Witzel’s Laurasian storyline and contemporaneous with the probably-astronomical temple of Göbekli Tepe. In the Mahabharata, composed much later thanthe Rig Veda, this same sky pattern is referenced again. Indra – the presiding ruler ofthe nakshatra Rohini – yields his place ‘at the head of the gods’ to Karttikeya, rulingdeity of Krittikas. Due to precession, Aldebaran (Rohini) moved from its wintersolstice position to be replaced by the Pleiades (Krittikas) at around 8,500 BCE.Further corroboration of these early dates comes from commentaries on the Rig Vedathat describe the Krittikas as ‘first of the divine stars,’ i.e. rising at the winter solstice,and end with Vishakha (Libra) at the summer solstice.Viewed with the eyes of a practical occultist, what is interesting is that theasterism as well as the directionality are equally important. Later Vedic texts describethe Krittikas as ‘never swerving from the east,’ which is very difficult to do over such along timeline unless you start celebrating the heliacal rising of the Pleiades on a153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"different quarter day. Indeed, the University of Helsinki’s Asko Parpola has found anumber of cultural references that tie the Pleiades to the autumnal equinox andpotentially to Harappan ritual, bringing us to 3,000 BCE and landing us back in DrPriyadarshi’s timeline. This will be discussed below. Dr Sidharth sees meaning in acurious passage in the (much later) Mahabharata where the age of the Krittikas cameto an end. The people wanted it to return and convinced the deity to do so. This may bea cultural expression of the Pleiades leaving one quarter day and then appearing onanother, millennia later.As expected, there is a Seven Sages/seven wives/banished to the sky motif inthe Vedic descriptions of the Pleiades, just as we find in the Pacific. There is acomponent to this motif that is probably highly significant. After a confusing birth storyinvolving Agni’s wife impersonating six of the wives of the Seven Sages because herhusband wanted to bed them, she is impregnated by Agni and gives birth to Karttikeya,who is then raised by the actual wives of the Seven Sages in the sky/in the Pleiades.Karttikeya rides a peacock, native to southern India, and the ‘eyes’ in its plumageprobably represent the stars of Pleiades. (Recall that in the Pacific, ‘Matariki’ isknown as ‘little eyes.’) Peacock and star motifs are prominent on pottery in some lateHarappan burial sites. Moving into historical times, Karttikeya – known as Murugan –was and is immensely popular in Southern and Tamil regions, right across toSingapore. He is commander-in-chief of the army of the gods and ‘precedes’ them,just as the Pleiades appear first of all the constellations. That the Pleiades would be sopopular in the southern parts of the subcontinent would be in keeping with any potentialinfluence from Island Southeast Asia at an early date, especially if the ‘little eyes’component is factored in.And if your mind has already landed on peacock angels and various ‘birds onsticks’ survivals from further north in Eurasia, then you are already several chaptersahead.Stellar FishStaying in areas of Tamil influence for the moment, we quote from AskoParpola’s ‘Beginnings of Indian Astronomy with Reference to a Parallel Developmentin China’:Native Dravidian names of stars, asterisms and planets preserved in Old Tamiltexts can be read in the logo-syllabic Indus script, where the most commonDravidian word for ‘star,’ mīņ, is expressed with the picture of its homonym mīn‘fish.’154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Among the Dravidian star names ending in mīn that are attested to in OldTamil is vaţa-mīņ ‘north star’; this compound has a counterpart in the Indusscript, where a pictogram resembling the ‘three-branched fig tree’ motif ofHarappan painted pottery occurs several times immediately before the plain‘fish’ sign. A homonym of vaţa ‘north’ is vaţam ‘banyan fig,’ the mighty tree withrope-like air-roots from which it has got its name. This Dravidian homonymyexplains two conceptions of Puranic cosmology, the banyan as the tree of thenorthern direction and the idea that stars and planets are tied to the pole star withinvisible ‘ropes of wind.’ As early as in Ŗgveda 1,24, reference is made to starsbeing ‘fixed above’ and to a banyan tree held up in the sky by King Varuna.Fig and fish combinations recur in seals and pottery right across the Harappanage. Found at Mohenjo-Daro, seal H-179 depicts a humanoid deity inside a fig tree,flanked by fish. This has echoes backwards into the Laurasian motif of tree burial/treespirits, and forwards into the Osiris myth. The continuity of these motifs backwardsfrom Old Tamil into both Harappan artefacts and the Rig Veda tells us several veryimportant things. Firstly, it demonstrates that the Indus culture very likely spoke aform of Proto-Dravidian. Secondly, it is further evidence connecting the Rig Veda toHarappan culture. Thirdly, it demonstrates that these probably extremely ancientmotifs have survived in recognisable form into the historical period (which is thewhole point of this book, of course).Finally – and I think most significantly – we have the explicit connection betweenstars and fish. Parpola believes the fish/star min derives from the Proto-Dravidianword for ‘to flash, shine, glitter.’ On my childhood trips to Fiji I would watch schools ofjuvenile barracuda from the edge of a jetty after supper. On a clear evening, it is nothard to see where the association comes from. It also recalls to mind thefishing/canoe motifs of the Pacific, the Milky Way as river (much as the celestialGanges pours down on Shiva’s head) and, crucially, provides an important solution tothe ‘Seven Sages dressed as fish-men’ motif encountered in Sumeria. These aren’tspace-suits. The sages are the stars and, specifically, they are probably the Pleiades.The ‘night sky as ocean with heavenly rivers and heavenly fish’ also survives into theBabylonian phase.Fish were a common pottery motif from the earliest Harappan periods and areamong the most common signs in the Indus script. The Sumerian script had apictogram for ‘star’ and so did not use ‘fish’ in its place. Sumerian depictions locatethe star pictogram near the heads of divinities to denote their divine origin. If ‘fish’ and‘star’ were interchangeable in Harappa and the Indus culture, then the exact same155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"fig. 12••practice emerges. This would explain why the famous ‘Master of the Animals’ sealfrom Mohenjo Daro has two fishes next to his head. It also invites us to some veryspecific interpretations of many other seals. Consider seal H-9 below, referenced inthe same article by Parpola.Seal H-9 from Harappa. (Imagecourtesy Archaeological Survey ofIndia)It has the number seven, then fish. Interestingly, it also has a bull. The Pleiades,as you know, constitute part of the constellation of Taurus. But is there evidence for theexistence of the Classical astrological constellations at this time depth?Other ConstellationsIn the later Babylonian texts, the names used for recognisable constellations areall Sumerian, with the prefix mul, meaning star.

It depicts a horned figure sitting in a yogic posewith some undeciphered glyphs, including a fish, running along the top. Commonlydescribed as having three faces, a better interpretation is that the Proto-Shiva has fourfaces, with the fourth facing away from the viewer.The four-faced ‘Proto-Shiva’ onseal M-304.

They suggest a levelof astronomical complexity far in advance of what is commonly expected and,conveniently for the thesis of this book, line up precisely with when we would expect tofind the influence of sophisticated climate refugees arriving from points east. Readthrough this a couple of times.We know that a year is 360 days. A divine year is 360 earth years, scaling upfrom the human to the gods.There are 12,000 divine years in each yuga, or Great Age (we live in the KaliYuga), which is divisible by the 12 stations/asterisms of the sun.Each yuga/Great Age is thus 4,320,000 earth years, and each one is divided intofour eras whose ratio diminishes, 4:3:2:1. (The same number, 4,320,000appears in Sumeria when describing the ages and lifetimes of antediluviankings, suggesting a shared origin of high astronomical mathematics.)Each of these four ‘sub eras’ consists of a main section and two subsections,like dawn and twilight, that are both 10% of the total time. So the Krita Yuga is4,000 divine years, with a 400 divine year period before and after it. The nextYuga is 3,000 divine years with two 300 divine year windows on either side, andso on.Dr Sidharth notes that this ‘10% on either side’ feature actually matches realtwilight on earth: sunrise and sunset are the periods when the sun is less than 18degrees below the horizon, and it obviously makes a 180 degree journey throughthe sky each day.There is one final compelling numerical relationship to consider: A full day is86,400 seconds, meaning a day and a night period are composed of 43,200seconds each.158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"There is more, specifically to do with the Vedic awareness of the extremely longcycles of eclipses. From The Celestial Key to the Vedas:In computing a Great Age, the Markandeya Purana invokes the factor ’71 and afraction thereof.’ This is an interesting clue. In fact, because of precession, thevernal equinox moves along the ecliptic by one degree in a little over seventy-one years. When we take this into account and remember that Śiva causes atotal solar eclipse in the lunar asterism Púshya, or Delta Cancri, at the end ofthe Great Age (as, in fact, is specifically mentioned, for example, in theMahābhārata, Vána Parva), it is easy to see that after about 4,320,000 years atotal solar eclipse recurs in the same lunar asterism when the Sun is at a fixedpoint in the ecliptic, say, the vernal equinox. This follows from the fact that432,000 years are almost exactly divisible by the eclipse cycle of 6585.32 days(18 years and 11.33 days, the saros). Secondly, the period of 4,320,000 years isdivisible by the precessional cycle of 25,867 years, corresponding to aprecession of 50.1 arc seconds per year, a value close to today’s accepted valueof 50.26 arc seconds per year. It is interesting that this concept of Śiva shootinghis arrow from the constellation of Púshya originates in the earliest piece ofHindu – indeed Indo-European – literature, namely the Ŗg Veda itself.There is also an interesting numerical twist here: 86,400,000 equals theproduct of 11 × 22 × 33 × 44 × 55! This kind of relationship is typical of thepoetic and esoteric nature of ancient Hindu astronomy.Astronomers make their own fun, eh? But the good doctor brings up an excellentpoint: the composers of the Rig Veda had a hugely sophisticated mathematicalcomponent to their star lore – at a date that straddles the end of the Ice Age – thatsuggests to those in the know that the movements of the macrocosm are reflected inthe movements of the microcosm, that there is a fractal component to this sky/grounddualism. Additionally, it encodes some alarmingly precise measurements for cosmicphenomena that took mankind literal millennia to prove correct.Ring any bells?Harappan StructuresArmed with an awareness of the sophisticated astronomy evident in the earliestof the Vedic texts, any number of Harappan rituals and structures begin to actuallymake sense. This is yet further evidence for their contemporaneity, especially whentheir complexity moves along a spectrum from ‘present, but nascent’ – as found in theRig Veda – to ‘full blown sky/ground dualism’ as evidenced in the Yajur Veda. And so159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"we return to the humble burnt brick.Returning to the ‘no bricks in the Rig Veda’ and ‘many bricks in the Yajur Veda,’it is highly illustrative that, in the context of listing the various nakshatras, we findspecific instructions on how to construct Vedic fire altars. 10,800 baked bricks arerequired, which is 360 (days in a year) x 30 (days in a month), over five levels. Mostcommonly, these fire altars are representations of the creator god, Prajapati, who alsorepresents the entire year. Thus we have the construction of a calendrical,microcosmic cosmos. It was, of course, the Harappans who built towns withpopulations numbering in the tens of thousands out of millions and millions of bakedbricks.Other Indus seals depict seven priests tending a fire altar. The site ofKalibangan, home of the mother goddess seal, has seven fire altars. Given the role ofthe Pleiades and their association with Agni/Prajapati/the beginning of the year, it isdifficult to draw any conclusion other than the suggestion that Harappa and the Vedasare intimately related, especially as the Pleiades rose on the vernal equinox during theHarappan era.It seems likely that the Harappans made use of gnomons or ‘sun sticks’; Onceyou have ensured a completely flat base, a stick perpendicular to the horizon can beused to determine solstices and equinoxes based on taking shadow measurements atmidday. About a dozen ‘pedestals’ have been found at Mohenjo Daro whose use iscurrently unknown. They look like solid, inverted bowls with a carefully flattened baseand an indentation in the top which could have held a wooden gnomon (or possibly alingam). Adding credence to the gnomon interpretation is they are decorated with thetrefoil pattern known to be associated with stars on the royal robes of Mesopotamia.The Vedas and their subsequent commentaries record multiple instructions for thebuilding of gnomons.Also worth noting is that several Harappan towns, including Rahman Dheri(3,000 BCE), were oriented to the cardinal directions. Streets and buildings inMohenjo Daro diverge two degrees from the cardinal points which, as Parpola notes,would align perfectly with the setting of Aldebaran behind the Kirthar mountains in thewest. Aldebaran is in between the Pleiades and Orion. It is a star in Taurus, the bull. AtMohenjo Daro’s latitude, Aldebaran is also close enough to the ecliptic to be regularlyocculted by the Moon, such as at times around the autumnal equinox.Kingly RitualJust as in Polynesia and Sumeria and Egypt, the ritual actions of the king were160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"crucial in aligning the heavenly and terrestrial realms. He was the cuckoo in theimperial clock, setting the royal calendar at regular intervals.This notion of kingship descending from the stars, and the king going up to thestars to ensure immortality and the wellbeing of the tribe is highly likely to be theorigin of the hermetic and Classical ritual magic we find in the grimoires, havingcome down to us via the dual routes of the Nile and the Fertile Crescent. If this stellartechnology reaches back to the first emergence of the Laurasian storyline, as I believeit does, then we may, with a straight face, say western ritual magic is at least 30,000years old. We may also, with a smiling face, send the Ancient Aliens crowd back tothe library to check their numbers.The earliest Vedas regularly mention the four or sometimes five directions ofspace. Returning to Asko Parpola’s ‘Beginnings of Indian Astronomy’:One ritual connected with the directions of space is crucially important forunderstanding their ideological significance. This is the ‘mounting of the regions’(digvyāsthāpanam), which is an essential part of the Vedic royal consecration. Inthis rite – also called Varuņa-sava as it is connected with the God Varuna, the‘divine king’ – the king at his consecration dons the tārpya garment ornamentedwith applicated figures of dhişņyas, i.e. ritual fireplaces equated with the stars ...This royal robe of Varuna almost certainly goes back to the trefoil-ornamented‘sky garment’ of the Harappan ‘priest-king’ modelled on Mesopotamianprototypes. Then the king makes a step in each of the five directions, therewithascending the zenith: ‘from the quarters he goes to the heaven’... ; for ‘heaven isthe quarters of space (diśo vai svargo lokah).’ The Śatapatha-Brāhmaņa(5,4,1,8) explains: ‘It is the seasons, the year, that he [the adhvaryu priest]thereby makes him [the king] ascend; and having ascended the seasons, theyear, he is high, high above everything here.’In the explicit use of directionality, we clearly see the shamanic origins of a ritualdesigned to both appropriate and set right the entire universe. Viewed with the eyes ofan occultist rather than an academic, we can spy the exact same ritual form present inOld Kingdom Egypt and Sumeria; so we now require an origin date for this‘astronomical immortality tech’ old enough to have influenced the very beginnings ofall three cultures. We also require a location for this tech that reconciles with itspresence in the Pacific and South America.HOW MUCH HARAPPA?161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"There are few places where academia has so boxed itself into a corner as withthe Indus Valley cultures. We are presented with an entire civilisation whose writtenlanguage we cannot decipher ending just before a mysterious cultural group – withouta homeland or genetic footprint – shows up with an apparently rapidly-assembledcosmology that not only describes the end of the Ice Age in Northwest India but is anexact match for many of the ritual items and structures found in Harappan cities.Realigning the cosmology of the Vedas with the development of the Harappancivilisation paints a more complete picture: we see Laurasian pastoralists survive aclimate event and then immediately develop in cultural and spiritual complexity;trading with, influencing and being influenced by their neighbours in all directions; all ofwhom underwent a simultaneous technological leap at this time that is so impressivewe might cheekily refer to it as the first space race, given its intimate association withstellar ritual magic.Refuseniks to the Ice Age/Harappa/Vedas realignment are, by definition,navigating with a dramatically incomplete map. At its height, it is estimated that theIndus Valley alone was home to a million people. The recently discovered Harappancity of Rakhigari is estimated to stretch over more than 224 hectares, of which onlythe tiniest minority have been excavated. The story of Harappa is not even close tobeing told in any complete fashion, and to confidently declare its total separation fromthe Eurasian oral cosmology known as the Vedas is foolishness in the extreme. Let noone tell you otherwise.SUMERIAThere is no question that the Sumerians, and specifically their origin, aredownright weird. None other than Carl Sagan himself said that if any ancient culturehad had contact with extraterrestrials, it would have been the Sumerians.Around 3,500 BCE they appear fully formed in the archaeological record,speaking a language entirely unrelated to those around it, building great cities andziggurats, irrigating the desert and writing, writing, writing as if the entire civilisationhad some form of OCD dementia.Mainstream academia’s refusal to close the Sumerian story’s gaping holes hasunfortunately led to a lot of people parking their flying saucers in them. In the otherwiseexcellent The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of The Flood, Dr Irving Finkelmoves straight from acknowledging we have no idea where Sumerian language camefrom to describing the language itself and how the reader may interpret Sumeriantexts. We should expect better.162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Returning to the evening of Dr Finkel’s book launch, I asked him about the factthat the earliest version of the Flood myth, based on his own translation, has animalsput into the ark that are all predomesticated, that is wild animals, from a time beforefarming. My question was whether he thought that meant the entire Flood myth had itsorigins in a cultural memory of the end of the Ice Age, i.e. a time prior to animaldomestication. He described my question as ‘huge’ and probably warranted a wholeseparate conference to ‘really thrash that out.’ This is academic speak for ‘yes,obviously, but I don’t want to be the one to say it. (In his defence, I probably wouldn’trisk a dream job at the British Museum, either.) In what has become the definitiveundergraduate textbook on the subject, A History of the Ancient Near East, Marc VanDe Mieroop writes:The rapid increase in settled populations at that time cannot be explained withcertainty. It seems too fast to have been the result of indigenous populationgrowth alone, even if new agricultural conditions promoted demographicexpansion. There may have been an increased sedentarization of semi-nomadicpeople previously unrecognizable in the archaeological record, or outsiders mayhave entered the region because of climatic changes or other reasons.Thus we can place the blame for the rapid growth in ‘Annunaki bloodline’ jibberjabber at the feet of academic timidity and groupthink, rather than at the feet of Sitchinand Von Daniken. The first step is, inevitably, admitting we have a problem. LikeHarappa, we are operating off a tiny dataset compared to what is actually available.Only a minority of Sumerian tablets in public hands have ever been translated.Notorious financial forecaster and analyst Martin Armstrong, a former privatecollector of Sumerian tablets, estimates that the tablets in public hands arethemselves a minority of the total excavated number, with a significant majorityfurnishing private collections around the world. The modern black market forSumerian antiquities is now entering its second century.It is not just tablets. We are also missing entire cities. Recently releasedimages from Cold War satellites show dozens and dozens of cities and large townsthat have clearly never been excavated. All of this before we even get to the fact thatSumeria appeared beside the high water mark of the end of the Ice Age, at the end ofthe Ice Age, with a worldwide Flood and stories of civilising sages as cornerstones oftheir cosmology. The gun could not possibly be emitting more smoke!By now, the story of Mesopotamia’s influence on western esotericism is a fairlywell told one, so we will not dwell on it here. The goal of this book is to push thetimelines back beyond it quite significantly and also demonstrate other,163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"underappreciated vectors of influence in general. What we need to do here isdemonstrate the earlier origins of and influences on the Sumerians to bring them intoalignment with the geology, genetics and astrotheology of contemporaneous cultures,because it very likely says something profound about the journey of the Laurasianstoryline in general and magic in particular.This also serves to permanently banish the aliens back into the sky, and frees upmodern esotericists to look anew at Sumerian star lore and what it might mean forcontemporary practice. Much like Dynastic Egypt, the holes in Sumeria are allbunched up at the beginning. Once the culture actually gets started, the flying saucershave a tendency to vanish on their own and Bronze Age civilisation continues on itsmerry way. So like the Flandrian Transgression bringing the ocean up to the gates ofEridu, we bring our story to the door but we do not enter.Sumerian MorphologyThe reason for contemporary squeamishness about cranial and skeletal studiesis not because the data are unsound, it is what the data have historically been used for.Late nineteenth century examinations of the cranial capacity of sub-Saharan Africanswas used to demonstrate they were ‘less intelligent’ than Caucasians, for instance.This is obviously the most preposterous pseudoscientific conclusion but the actualdata – that skull shapes differ between racial groups – are sound. A good example ofusing these data correctly would be the field of forensics, where human remains aregradually identified based on their morphology.There is perhaps a secondary reason for modern historians to pretend thesedata do not exist. And that is because, in cases such as Sumeria and Egypt, we onceagain have hard scientific evidence that falls outside of their preferred story of whathappened in the past. What came to be known as ‘the Sumerian problem’ in the lastcentury was the realisation gleaned from skeletal and cranial evidence that theSumerian cities were multi-ethnic. The story of attempting to solve the Sumerianproblem mirrors the story of increasing racial awareness inside archaeology over thelast 130 years. It begins with invading superior races, the ‘real Sumerians,’dominating an indigenous Semitic tribe. The Sumerians came from Iran, theSumerians came from the Caucasus, the Sumerians came from wherever.At its core was the early twentieth century belief that race and civilisation wereinterrelated, probably the source of diffusionism’s unpopularity today. As therealisation grew that race and civilisation were arbitrarily connected – and that bothterms probably do not have much underlying reality, anyway – ‘the Sumerian problem’stopped being a topic of discussion. ‘New Archaeology’ arose in conjunction with164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"postmodernism, that described culture as exclusively the interaction of a populationwith its local environment.Nevertheless there are still all those skulls and bones languishing in London’sNatural History Museum and the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. A1930s analysis of skulls from Kish revealed a small minority of Austric skulls, asmaller minority of Armenoid skulls and a large majority of skulls described as‘Eurafrican.’ Somewhere near the centre of the Sumerian problem was the earlytwentieth century realisation that most of the Sumerian depictions were round-headedand most of the skulls uncovered were long-headed; only a minority matched theskulls as depicted, so ‘clearly’ these must have been an invading elite.It has been almost a hundred years since these interpretations were takenseriously. Other options have emerged. Given that ‘Eurafrican’ skulls have the samefeatures as Australoid – that is southern India/New Guinean/Australian – some haveposited an influence from the Dravidian regions up into Sumeria at an early date.Others have countered by saying it is not that unusual for Africans to have been livingin Kish or Eridu given their locations, which is certainly true, but the same can be saidof India (which is my preferred interpretation of the skulls). In any case, there aremultiple genetic links between East Africa and Dravidian India at an early date so I amnot sure how useful the distinction really is. It appears that since probably before theend of the Ice Age these cultures were sailing up and down the coast and catching theMonsoon to and from the Horn of Africa.That complexity is sort of the point. In the oldest extant Sumerian city, Eridu,cultural continuity in temple design and use has been demonstrated from the Ubaidperiod up into the Sumerian period. Looking at the change from the Ubaid period to theUruk period, the archaeologist Henri Frankfort noted that the people associated withthis cultural change were brachycephalic, a skull shape commonly associated withpeople from the east.EriduEridu is the oldest Sumerian city (above sea level). Given it exhibits continuityfrom the Ubaid period up, that means it dates to around 5,000 BCE at the latest.(Interestingly, this is the same time as Mehrgarh Period II, about when we see firedbricks and probably the increased astronomical complexity of the Yagur Veda.)PERIODDATING (BCE)COMMENTS165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Hassuna /Samarra/Halaf5500–4500Neolithic/Chalcolithic archaeologicalculturesUbaid5000–3600rural settlements in southernMesopotamia; introduction of artificialirrigationUruk3600–3100large-scale urbanisation; firstpictographic scriptJemdet Nasr3100–2900development of the cuneiform scriptEarly Dynastic I/III2900–2350many Sumerian city states in southernMesopotamia; Semitic states in the northAkkadian/Gutean2350–2100unification of Mesopotamia by a Semiticdynasty; invasion of Guteans fromGutiumUr III2100–2000reunification by a Sumerian dynastyThere certainly appears to be more continuity between the various periods,particularly at Eridu, than a neat little table may immediately imply. Crucially whentracking magical vectors or survival, these continuities appear to be cultural ratherthan technological. If Dr Oppenheimer is correct, which seems likely, that the earliestlayers of the Ubaid period are at the bottom of the Arabian Gulf, then he suggests thecivilising component of the story of Ea – a very Austronesian-sounding name – maywell reflect an historical episode: Ea brought the seven amphibian sages from the Eastto teach mankind the skills of civilisation. Ubaid pottery continued in the samelocation, Eridu, as the later, and cruder, Uruk pottery style. From an archaeologicalperspective, this is further evidence for cultures with different levels of technologicalcomplexity occupying the same space.It seems significant that temples, which were larger to begin with, becamesmaller than palaces or kings’ residences over the course of Sumerian civilisation. DrOppenheimer suggests this could indicate the initial pre-eminence of a new priesthood– and I would say an astronomical priesthood – gradually declining as powercentralised around the king. If this is indeed the case it may have coincided with thegradual rise to pre-eminence of the planets and the sun over the lunar/stellar calendar.Repositioning the Flood166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"•••••••You will recall that the ancient Near East flooded at the end of the Ice Age inthree distinct phases.9,000 BCE: First, there was the flooding of what is now the Arabian Gulf butwould have been a presumably quite lovely river valley at the time. (Great placeto live!)5,500 BCE: Further flooding of the gulf that brought the Tigris and Euphratesriver mouths to approximately where they are today.3,500 BCE: The Flandrian Transgression, that took the coastline a further 180kilometres inland, very close to Eridu. The sea level gradually subsided to itspresent level over the next one and a half thousand years.If you cast your eyes back up to that table of Sumerian periods, you will quicklysee some highly suspicious alignments. Realising there were three distinctinundations also provides a neat solve for some of the absurdities associated with theearliest dynasties of Kish, Ur and Erech. The King Lists unambiguously state that ‘theflood’ happened before the first dynasties of these three cities. This is commonlyassumed to be the Flandrian Transgression, but that only gives a few hundred yearsfor the Early Dynastic Period to begin. The ‘solve’ for this, such as it is, is to state thatKish, Ur and Erech’s dynasties ran concurrently à propos of any evidence pointing inthis direction.Of course, if ‘the flood’ refers to the 5,500 BCE inundation of the Arabian Gulf,then we have a lot more runway in which to allow these dynasties to take off. We alsohave an opportunity to look at the eight kings who reigned ‘before the flood.’On that last note, the king lists begin with kingship itself descending fromheaven, just as it does in Polynesia and the Vedas. The extremely long reigns of thesefirst kings – widely misinterpreted as proof of their alien status – are in the very literalsense astronomical numbers.The first king, Alulim, ruled for 28,800 years. This divides precisely into4,320,000 150 times, or three times into 86,400.The next king, Alalngar, ruled for 36,000 years, which is half a precessionalcycle of 72,000. (And 1/120th of 4,320,000.)En-men-lu-ana actually ruled for the Vedic number of 43,200 years.En-men-gal-ana was another 28,800 reign.167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"••Dumuzid, the Shepherd, ruled for 36,000 years. Incidentally, if ‘the Shepherd’isn’t Orion, I will eat my hat.En-sipad-zid-ana also had a 28,800 reign.Interestingly, the remaining two kings’ shorter reigns (of 21,000 years for En-mendur-ana and Ubara- Tutu’s brisk 18,600 years) cease dividing conveniently intothe cosmic Vedic number and become divisible by 12, which is a more human/earthcentric number; the twelve constellations.The supposedly ‘human’ first kings of the First Dynasty of Kish which follows onfrom these large numbers, after the Flood, are also divisible by 12. ‘After the flood hadswept over, and the kingship had descended from heaven, the kingship was in Kish.’Jushur ruled for 1200 years, Kullassina-bel for 960 years, and so on. Not all of theFirst Dynasty kings are neatly divisible by 12, but a majority of them are, whichindicates the same progression down from a calendrical, cosmic ‘Golden Age’ – asexpected for a Laurasian mythology. Very large ‘stellar’ numbers scale down to‘smaller’ planetary and astrological numbers. These planetary or ‘earth centric’numbers scale down again to reigns more in keeping with human lifespans. As the‘Golden Age’ became ‘our’ age, so kingship scaled down from the stars to humans.Same calendrical system, same source of kingship, same time period. Sitchin’sAnnunaki did not come from the stars, they are the stars.Seven SagesYou may have guessed that I suspect the ‘seven amphibious sages who camefrom the East’ are the Pleiades. But it is a common pitfall of astrotheological researchto assume that just because an event or person can be matched to one asterism oranother then that event did not happen or that person did not exist. We need to adoptthe more mythic thinking of our ancestors: any purported civilising refugees comingfrom the direction of the rising of the Pleiades would be associated with that asterism.It is a ‘both’ form of thinking, rather than an ‘either/or.’ In fact it may be that if theirarrival had coincided with the heliacal rising of the Pleiades then they might havereceived a better reception and it was this fortunate timing that led to their civilisingefforts being so successful.For whatever it is worth, many scholars of Mesopotamia are surprisingly opento the idea this was an actual event, presumably without fully thinking through theimplications of it: if the sages were real, where did they come from?

These include:The prominence of the Pleiades, Taurus and Orion.A Lunar calendar that predates a solar one.Precision alignment of buildings to particular asterisms, or the creation of ‘mapsof the sky’ here on earth.Kingship descending from the stars and the ritual requirement of the king toreturn to them to secure his own immortality and safeguard the life of thetribe/city.The simultaneous appearance of this magical technology, along with othertechnologies such as irrigation-based agriculture (such as you find in the ancientrice paddies of Southeast Asia).There is also sufficient overlap in the magic and ritual structures of SouthAmerica (and China to some considerable extent) to make the case that we canprecisely locate the influencing ancestor culture at the last point on earth where thesethree cultures had the opportunity to diverge.What you are looking at here might be called Proto-Hermeticism: a magicaltechnology that involves mirroring the sky on the ground for the purposes of achievingunion with the universe/immortality. We are thus presented with the amusing situationof proving accidentally correct all those Renaissance magicians who saw the wisdomof Hermes Trismegistus as coming down to mankind from a time before the Flood.

E. S. Edwards, Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities, BritishMuseumTHE MIRROR OFHEAVENWhen it came to the stars, the Egyptians were not fucking around. In order toexplore this crucial pivot point in the development of western astrotheology, I have toassume the reader has a reasonable knowledge of Ancient Egypt history andtopography, because there simply is not the space for hand-holding. In terms of thelatter, a quick image search on your phone will suffice to locate any cities or sites youmay be unfamiliar with. In terms of the former, there are any number of worthwhilebooks to choose from.I mention this because there is a persistent tendency among occultists to treatthe entire length of Ancient Egyptian civilisation as broadly the same. But the Isis of theLate Period is not the Isis of the Old Kingdom. An analogy with Jesus, who has been agod for a lot less time than the Mother of Horus, is illustrative. Early depictions ofJesus show him as a peacock or a fish, then a glowing, Apollonian child, then theactual sun. Sometimes he has a beard and sometimes he doesn’t. In the east heshows up in icons with the sort of creepy stare you associate with escaped mentalpatients riding on the same bus as you. He’s black in a few places but not all thatmany. During the Renaissance he becomes a pin-up for some profoundly homoerotic,hyperreal sadomasochism. By the time we get to the megachurches of regionalAmerica he is an unadorned stick in an enormous room, standing behind a man whois loudly asking a bank of television cameras for more money. He has had a busy1,800 years, especially for someone who never physically existed.We see a similar thing in Egypt over a much longer time frame, with gradualchanges to cosmology matching the changes in society and the shifting of centres ofpower up and down the Nile as priesthoods rise and fall, before finally reaching adizzying hybridity in the Late and Graeco-Roman Period as the Egyptians adopted the171"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"same ‘Lego block’ approach to divinities as the Greeks. That final hybrid phase is thefertile swamp from which a largely recognisable modern western magic grows.Endlessly fascinating as the full sweep of Ancient Egyptian history is, ourprincipal focus is on the parts leading up to the First Intermediate Period in thefollowing table.Predynastic EgyptN/ABefore 3,100BCEEarly Dynastic Period1st–2nd Dynasties3,100–2,686BCEOld Kingdom3rd–6th Dynasties2,686–2,181BCEFirst Intermediate Period7th–10th Dynasties2,181–2,055BCEMiddle Kingdom11th–12th Dynasties2,055–1,650BCESecond Intermediate Period13th–17th Dynasties1,650–1,550BCENew Kingdom18th–20th Dynasties1,550–1,069BCEThird Intermediate Period21st–25th Dynasties1,069–664 BCELate Period26th–31st Dynasties664–332 BCEPtolemaic PeriodN/A332–30 BceThe official narrative goes something like this. The Predynastic Period was atime of scattered villages up and down the Nile, building things out of mud bricks. TheDynastic Period begins in earnest with a king from Upper Egypt unifying the countryby force. Thereupon he and his descendants start building pointy tombs of increasingcomplexity, then decreasing complexity but this time with writing inside them, andthen Egypt is invaded and collapses (the First Intermediate Period). Things get slightlybetter again, access to the afterlife is democratised and commoners start paintinggods and judgement on the inside of their coffins, some new priests are in charge and172"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"then the whole place collapses through invasion again. The New Kingdom is where allthe telegenic stuff you see in documentaries happens: Ramses, Tutankhamun, thatpointy headed one with the lady hips on the History Channel who worships UFOs orsomething.

It proceeds through a succession of largely foreign rulers until Alexander theGreat invades the place, installs the Ptolemies on the throne and that period ends withCleopatra committing suicide with a snake to the boob.But if you look back up at the first row in the table, you will see that ‘before 3,100BCE’ has so far been where all the action in the book has been. To get a clearerpicture, we must erase some of these artificial horizons and look at the wholespectrum.THE (GRAND) ROGUES’ GALLERYThough we went to some trouble to shine a light on the highly dysfunctionalculture of academia in a previous chapter, Egyptology certainly deserves to be singledout before we go any further, as it has been filled with thieves, vandals, hate-mongersand lunatics for centuries.Nowhere is the need for reorienting of our understanding of the past around harddata more critical. Doing so tends to make ‘expert consensus’ opinion melt away likecake in the rain, which may explain why they are so loudly hostile to its introductioninto the discourse. Egyptological gate-keeping is probably the most shrill among allthe humanities subjects masquerading as hard sciences.Speaking of gatekeeping, a story told by an independent researcher ismetaphorically and literally illustrative. During research trips for his two latest books,Egyptian Dawn and The Sphinx Mystery, Robert Temple had to get authorities tosmash rusted locks with hammers because the keys had been lost decades ago,granting access to parts of the Valley Temple and Sphinx Temple, where he foundentirely undocumented chambers and described them for the first time. These aresites that, even with the calamitous drop-off in tourist numbers in recent times,millions of people walk past each year and can often peer into, as they are open to theair. Some of the temple areas he ‘discovered’ actually had cables running throughthem that were laid down by staging technicians for the evening light show! That ishow poorly the official narrative actually matches the facts on the ground. It was not alack of funds that prevented bringing these ‘discoveries’ to the public – borrowing ahammer to break a lock is free – anymore than a lack of funds would prevent thediscovery of a second Magic Mountain at Disneyland. It was systemic ineptitude andcronyism on the part of Egyptology. Given Giza’s importance to Egyptian history – and173"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"probably the esoteric history of much of mankind – this is outrageous.Outrage, inevitably, is a common emotion among Egyptology watchers. You willno doubt be familiar with Zahi Hawass and his ubiquitous hat from the last twodecades of largely content-free cable history programmes. (And the subsequentDepartment of Justice investigation into National Geographic and Zahi Hawass forallegations of bribery. By their own admission, they are paying him $200,000 a year forlife. His government salary was approximately £10,000.) From humble beginnings inthe Egyptian Delta, Hawass was plucked from his minor Giza inspector role by thedirect intervention of the son of Edgar Cayce, Hugh Lynn; who arranged a fullscholarship at the University of Pennsylvania thanks to a member of the scholarshipboard also happening to be a member of Cayce’s Association for Research andEnlightenment. (This was part of the ARE’s multi-decade attempts to get specialaccess to sites on the Giza Plateau, specifically the structures underneath the Sphinxwhere Cayce believed the Atlantean hall of records was to be found.)Hawass’s curious associations do not end there. In Breaking the Mirror ofHeaven, Robert Bauval and Ahmed Osman recount the tale of a ‘surprise’ visit to theGiza Plateau by none other than NATO-deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.Hawass had set up a small table between the paws of the Sphinx to display somerecently discovered statues dating back to the Fifth Dynasty. One in particular wasexceedingly rare as it still retained some of its original paintwork. The then-head of theEgyptian Antiquities Organisation, the job Hawass was gunning for and got, heardabout the visit on the radio as he had not been informed. He raced over there in a taxionly to find Hawass declaring that one of the statues was ‘missing.’ This was the verysame statue Hawass used in a magazine photoshoot with Omar Sharif only threemonths prior.The man solely responsible for worldwide archaeological access within Egyptcertain kept some unusual company but we can be sure of one thing. Very few of themwere Jews, as Hawass is fiercely antisemitic. He has repeatedly declared thatanyone who disagrees with him is part of a Zionist conspiracy, held press conferencesin which he announces the Jews did not build the pyramids and that Israel is trying tosteal the pyramids and Egyptian civilisation. Antisemitism inevitably plays well to thecrowd in Arab countries, but Hawass takes even this to exciting, conspiracy-ladenlevels. In a 2009 interview on Egypt’s Memri TV, he said that Jews control the entireworld: ‘For 18 centuries, they were dispersed throughout the world. They went toAmerica and took control of its economy. They have a plan. Although they are few innumber, they control the entire world.’174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"How did the global archaeological community deal with Hawass’s terrifyingreign? Uneasily, and with stony, cowardly silence. From a 2005 New York Timesarticle by Sharon Waxman:But there are those who say Dr. Hawass does not merely impose rules, he hogsthe field. Last year two French researchers accused Dr. Hawass of treatingEgypt as ‘his private hunting ground’ after they were denied permission to inserta camera lens through the floor of the Great Pyramid at Giza in search of asecret chamber. Dr. Hawass denounced the men as amateurs, though they havesuccessfully made other discoveries with the technique.Dr. Hawass also denounced as ‘nuts’ an English archaeologist, JoannFletcher, who announced a theory in 2003 that a previously discovered mummywas in fact Queen Nefertiti. British press accounts say that Dr. Hawass wasmore upset that she had revealed her findings on the Discovery Channel, whichfinanced her work, rather than bringing the results to him to announce. She wasbanned from further work in Egypt.Egyptology in action, right there. Where is the global outrage from the likes ofthe British Museum or the Smithsonian? In the May 22 2005 issue of the SundayTimes Magazine, Richard Girling wrote:‘They call him the Pharaoh, the keeper of the pyramids. He rules Egyptologywith an iron fist and a censorious tongue. Nobody crosses Zahi Hawass andgets away with it ... nobody of any standing in Egyptology will come out to helpyou,’ said one well-known Egyptologist of his colleagues, ‘because they’d losetheir jobs.’ ... Hawass ... holds the keys to the pyramids, the Valley of the Kings,the Sphinx, Abu Simbel, everything. No Egyptologist gets in without hispermission, and few will chance his anger. [...]‘There are people digging out there,’ says another UK specialist, ‘who arepraying they won’t find anything significant. If they do, they know the dig will beshut down until a certain individual arrives to take over. There are artefacts thathave been excavated, only to be put back until the certain personage gets roundto visiting the site so that he can “discover” them for himself.’Another Cayce angle comes by way of Mark Lehner, described as the world’sforemost authority on the Sphinx and the Pyramids. The son of ARE members, it wasHugh Lynn, once again, who arranged the funding for Lehner to study at the AmericanUniversity in Cairo. (In fact it was Lehner who made the introduction between Hawassand Hugh Lynn.) To give credit where it is due, the Association for Research and175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Enlightenment has played a very successful long game. In his previously mentionedbook and The Secret Chamber, Bauval notes that he has video and photographic proofof ARE excavations and photometric research in and around the Sphinx and thePyramid enclosures.But this is, in fact, the heart of the matter. The Hawass regime was a time of‘multiple Egyptologies,’ with tightly controlled paid access made available to variousprivate organisations combined with a simultaneous doubling-down on an ‘officialnarrative’ that, as we shall see, is positively Discworldian in its absurdity. If you didnot stump up the money or toe the line, you were branded a pyramidiot and a Jew.Even as this chapter was being written, Zahi Hawass stormed out of a planned debatewith Graham Hancock when he saw an image of Robert Bauval on one of the slides,declared him ‘a thief,’ claimed he had never heard of Göbekli Tepe, and then wouldonly deign to return to the room if the debate was cancelled. National Geographic hascertainly had better behaved, better informed (if not better paid) ‘Explorers inResidence.’Very occasionally, this clown show has resulted in exasperation in the wider,more scientifically inclined corners of Egyptology, such as in the following from theProceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists in 2004, by thedelightfully passionate Alfredo Gennaro.Nevertheless we think it is worthy to give credit to some of the figures we had toface in the preliminary study [on hypothetical construction methods and size ofworkforce]. At the light of these figures, the current hypotheses on how the GizaPyramids were built appear to be inconsistent, sometimes completelyimpracticable. [...]Figures! We need figures, not the generalities we can read in the‘accepted’ literature.Take the ramp theory. A ramp one km long to get the top of the CheopsPyramid would have a slope not comfortable but possible, with a volume of5,600,000 cubic meters, the double than the pyramid itself (sic): with thedifference that the volume, divided in personal loads of 25 litres (50 kg at a time)would require 224,000,000 travels to be accumulated and as many to bedismantled, namely 90 years of a continuous one thousand person process.The ramp theory Gennaro refers to is one of the ‘explanations’ offered by peoplewith evidently no experience in construction for how the Great Pyramid in particularwas ever managed to be built as a tomb in two and half decades during the reign of a176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"single king. The ‘generalities’ he mentions are the Egyptological tendency to breezepast this physical impossibility with a casual backwards comment: ‘they probablyused a ramp and I am sure we will find evidence of it one day.’Let me be clear. On available evidence, it is currently more likely that thepyramids were built by little green men in flying saucers than by a few thousand men,living in workers’ villages we have never been able to find, using a ramp with twicethe volume of the structure it was used to build. Nevertheless, the ramp not onlyrefuses to die, but resurfaces in the latest theory by the world’s foremost authority onthe Sphinx and the pyramids, Mark Lehner, who combines two nonexistent objects intoone in a bewildering ‘super solve.’ From a January 28, 2014 Live Science article byOwen Jarus:The recent discoveries [that the ‘workers’ villages’ were actually barracks forhighborn visitors] at Giza leave a mystery in their wake: Where were thedwellings of the pyramid builders, the regular workers, located?The answer may be on the pyramids themselves. ‘We could probably becorrect imagining workers staying on the immense ramps, on the unfinished pyramidas it rose,’ said Lehner in an email to Live Science, adding that they could also havebeen living in the quarries in simple dwellings akin to ‘lean-to’s.’Even my truck-and-train obsessed nephew would find logistically dubious theidea of a workforce of up to a hundred thousand living on the construction site theywere conscripted to for a period of two decades, having their sleeping quarters in theway of a ramp that would need to place a multi-tonne block in situ every ninetyseconds. He is four years old. But we have very little need of my nephew’s expertisebecause the independent Egyptological world – Hawass’s Jews and pyramidiots – is,in fact, awash with specialist experts in topics that actually describe reality. Theseinclude engineers, nuclear physicists, geologists, desert construction experts – fieldswhere, if they get their numbers wrong, buildings collapse and planes fall out of thesky. And the good news is they appear to be winning the mind war. Not that Lehner’sRampopolis is not a particularly threatening opponent, of course. One may as well saythe pyramid workers lived in Narnia and journeyed back through the wardrobe at theend of each day. (We will return to the ramp below, with a potential solve provided,inevitably, by an architect and a chemist rather than an Egyptologist.)All of this is to emphasise that, when it comes to the story of Egypt’s beginnings,the ‘home team’ does not have a lot going for it, at least not in the past thirty or soyears. The Egyptologists of a century ago displayed much greater willingness to177"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"follow where the evidence led them and would likely have relished the input ofengineers, physicists and geologists, rather than dismissing their facts as irrelevantbecause ‘they are not Egyptologists.’ This is akin to declaring crime does not existbecause one does not happen to be a court sketch artist.As ever, we will highlight the physical data and offer an interpretation that coversit rather than ignores it, as well as one that falls into broad alignment with the widergenetic, morphological, mythological and climatic data we have already examined.For magicians it is well remembered that, when it comes to data interpretation, out ofanywhere on earth, here we are not playing in the Egyptologists’ sandpit. They areplaying in ours.PREDYNASTIC EGYPTAnother artificial horizon is in need of erasure. The Pharaohs themselves did notthink in dynasties. It was the third century BCE priest, Manetho, writing in Greek, whofirst categorised Egypt’s ancient kings in this way. The idea is actually quite alien toEgyptian royalty, who focused on continuity, eternal cycles and Maat. In an importantsense they each became the preceding ruler, meaning they would make terribleguests on Who Do You Think You Are. (Although the episodes themselves would bemercifully brief.)Once freed of the dynastic concept, it becomes much easier to get a sense ofquite how far back the Pharaohs thought their civilisation went. The unification ofUpper and Lower Egypt under Menes – where Manetho begins his dynasties – was byno means the beginning of the story, just as the unification of Italy in the nineteenthcentury is not the beginning of Italian history. In fact, unsurprisingly given theircommon Laurasian origin, Egyptian kings – just as their Sumerian counterparts did –trace back beyond human kings to an era of semidivine rulers, to a time when Egyptwas ruled by the gods themselves. The astronomical numbers used to describe theirreigns indicate they saw these beings as the stars, too. In Seti I’s Abydos temple – atemple to the ancestors as described below – he is depicted with his young son,Ramses II, petitioning Ptah-Seker-Osiris on behalf of their ’72 ancestors.’ Seventy twois the precessional number par excellence.Manetho’s dynasty-based king list is about as incomplete as the rest of themand, like our other sources for Egypt’s rulers, they get messier the further back yougo. From Robert Temple’s Egyptian Dawn:The chronology of ancient Egyptian history is ... firmly established as far backas 2,000 BCE. Prior to that, there was something called the First Intermediate178"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Period, which was a period of total social and political collapse. It is thought thisperiod was marked by floods, droughts, plagues and lawlessness. No oneknows exactly how long this period lasted, but ... many think it was about 150years. [...] Before this, there were the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties of the OldKingdom. They were a kind of tepid afterflow of the glory of the true OldKingdom, which consisted of the Third and Fourth Dynasties. It used to bethought that the First and Second Dynasties should be considered part of the OldKingdom, but now it has become fashionable to speak of those as the ‘ArchaicPeriod.’ One reason for that is we know so little about them. (However, it mustbe said that we know even less about the Third Dynasty, but people oftenoverlook that fact.)The unsettling thing is that prior to – let us say – 2200 BCE, the chronologyof Egyptian history essentially falls apart. Everything before that date is more orless lost in a kind of chronological chaos. There are many Egyptologists who donot think this. But that is because they simply comfort themselves withchronological assertions. They simply decide certain dates.The net effect of this is that no one has any idea how many kings there were inthe Fourth Dynasty, the alleged period of Giza pyramid construction, or even how longit lasted. Only three royal funerary monuments from the Third Dynasty have beenfound. None of the historical sources agree on the number of kings or their names, butthey all mention kings in between Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure; so where are their‘pointy tombs’? Second Dynasty kings such as Teti share the same name with SixthDynasty kings – they all had multiple names to start with – and several sources usedto compile the royal lineage of Egypt list names going back tens of millennia. (ASecond Dynasty king’s name was excavated in a Giza Valley Temple, purported tohave been built in the Fourth Dynasty.)‘Unification’Emphasising the messiness of Egyptian chronology at the beginning of the so-called Dynastic Period is not another jab at the Ankh-Morpork college of globalEgyptology – I have already scratched that itch. It is simply to lengthen out thetimelines that we need to work to. As with Sumerologists and Assyriologists insistingthat everything be sandwiched into their arbitrary dates, the Egyptological refusal tokick out their timings has given rise to engineering impossibilities like building theGreat Pyramid in a couple of decades using logs and dolerite pounders. And thisrefusal has attracted flying saucers just as surely as garbage attracts flies. It isamazing how much a little humility regarding what we do and do not currently179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"understand about Predynastic Egypt can do to pack the saucers back off to ZetaReticuli.As the evidence of missing kings and overlapping dynasties is reexamined, itbecomes clear that the story of the Nile valley and delta is anything but neat. Clearlycultures of differing levels of complexity existed simultaneously and side-by-side; thisis the cleanest, indeed the only, solve for having simultaneous reigns for Archaic andPredynastic kings. The Nile is a very long river, after all. It is largely our modern beliefin national borders that prevents us from thinking about the place as a home tomultiple kings and warlords.There is a growing academic consensus that Menes, the king who unified Upperand Lower Egypt, is probably part of the same mythological ‘law-giver’ type we find inother Laurasian cultures. Other examples would be ‘Manu’ or ‘Moses.’ If he did havean historical existence, then it appears his claim to have unified the country is the3,100 BCE equivalent of descending from a helicopter onto the deck of an aircraftcarrier and unfurling a ‘mission accomplished’ banner. We may have been toocredulous in expecting the politicians of the ancient world to be any different from ourown. Otherwise, why do so many kings after Menes exclaim how they have alsounified Egypt? One suspects the peasants have been revolting for a very long time.The African Fertile CrescentAlong the coast of North Africa, between the Egyptian Delta and the Atlantic,there are hundreds and hundreds of megalithic sites, some bearing a startlingresemblance to Stonehenge, thanks to the presence of trilithons weighing in at dozensof tonnes. Most often, these are explained away as Roman olive presses, but theexplanation does not hold up to very much scrutiny. Certainly, some of the sites mayhave been repurposed as such by the Romans, but we are left with the fact that FirstDynasty jars that once contained olive oil are marked as being from Libya or ‘OliveLand’/Ta Tehenu. Ancient Egyptian conceptions of Libya, or any other foreign land,were far from precise. It is generally accepted that ‘Libya/Olive Land,’ sincepredynastic times, referred to the western delta of Egypt proper, all of coastal NorthAfrica and potentially even parts of Southern Spain.The scale of the agrarian society appears to have been substantial, based on theboasts of livestock volumes having been ‘captured’ from ‘Libya’ by kings right up tothe Fourth Dynasty numbering in the hundreds of thousands, potentially millions. Forthose very early kings of Upper Egypt, the tattooed Libyans of the western delta andtheir vast herds would have looked very appealing.180"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"One of the questions Robert Temple sought to answer in the previouslymentioned Egyptian Dawn was which cultures that preceded the Old Kingdom had thecapacity to move stones weighing well over 100 tonnes and, based on the size andweight of some of these ‘Libyan’ megaliths, he thinks he has found it. There iscertainly good evidence for there being more than one game in town.Nabta PlayaAs a result of the changing climate that followed the end of the Ice Age, around9,000 BCE, the Monsoon rains of Central Africa moved north and began to fall oversouthwestern Egypt, turning an arid landscape into one of savannah-style grasslandand thousands of shallow pools or ‘playas’ that would dry and refill again with eachrainy season. The monsoonal pattern ended abruptly around 3,500 BCE – and byabruptly I mean potentially in a single lifetime – at which point this part of the Saharabecame desert once more. You will note that 3,500 BCE is the ‘accepted date’ for theemergence of civilisation in the nearby Nile Valley. Funny how these dates keep liningup.Nabta Playa is the location of several dozen remarkable calendrical circles andother astronomically aligned megaliths in what is now hyper-arid desert. The earliestradiocarbon dates (from firepits, etc.) date back to around 10,000 BCE and end justbefore 3,000 BCE, with the majority of dates clustering around 6,000 BCE. (You willremember this is the same time as the first appearance of the sheep, an Indiancreature, in northeast Africa.) These remains would have been left by nomadicherdspeople bringing their livestock to the area once the rains had led to the grass’sreturn.In The Origin Map, Dr Thomas Brophy undertook a meticulous examination ofthe astronomical alignments of some of the most prominent stones on the playa.Meticulous may be an understatement. Dr Brophy received his PhD in Physics,worked on NASA’s Voyager project, the Japanese Space Program, worked with theLaboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and has been published by IEEEJournal and Science.The majority of the astronomically aligned stones lie on top of, or are embeddedin, playa sediment layers dating from between 6,050 BCE and 5,300 BCE.Complicating this picture is that, underneath the main complex known as the CalendarCircle, the bedrock underneath all the playa sedimentation has been deliberatelyshaped by human hands. The earliest layers of sedimentation were laid down around10,000 BCE. (Recall that Göbekli Tepe’s bedrock floor was also deliberately shaped,181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"and at around the same time.) Inserted in between the shaped bedrock and the surfaceCalendar Circle, a large boulder carved in a bovine shape was discovered, buried soas to appear that it was ‘standing up.’ In an article, ‘The Mystery of Nabta Playa,’contributed to special issue vol. 8, no. 6 of New Dawn magazine, Dr Brophy writes:Nabta Playa ... was filled with shallow water part of the year and the megalithswould have emerged out of the still water that may well have reflected star lightalong the sight lines to the observer – that would have made the alignmentseasily apparent for an observer situated at the central megalithic construction.182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"fig. 14Reconstruction of the stone circleat Nabta Playa183"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Such a phenomenon would also reflect the night sky down on earth, as in amirror (of heaven). As you probably expect, the stellar alignments of the CalendarCircle are precisely associated with the stars that make up Orion, Sirius and thecircumpolar stars. The site displays evidence of being ‘calendrically adjusted’ overthe millennia of its use as the positions of the stars in the sky inevitably changed. Herewe have a frankly astonishing example of the continuity of the association betweenOrion/Shepherd/Bull/Taurus being used as the principal clock of a herding culture aswell as – to my eyes – very good evidence for how this cultural clock is folded intoconceptions of a stellar afterlife. The ‘clock’ that indicates the return of the rains iscosmic, after all. It keeps the beat for all of creation. If these ideas sound ‘toosophisticated for a herding culture’ to your mind, it is worth remembering that,although 10,000 BCE is a very long time ago, it is still a further 10,000 years removedfrom Dr Witzel’s proposed dating for the emergence of the Laurasian storyline, whichthis certainly falls into. We will return to some of Dr Brophy’s more astonishingfindings in a later chapter because they speak of the potential consciousness effectsthat can arise from ritually focusing on specific parts of the night sky. I highlyrecommend sourcing a copy of his book.In the mean time, Nabta Playa is important for our story because it providesevidence for the local significance of Osiris/Orion before the advent of agriculture, withwhich he would later become associated. Here, I suspect he was still seen as ‘theshepherd,’ the role he moved into after leaving his previous job as ‘the hunter.’ Bydefinition the teacher must predate the class, and it was believed that Osiris did indeedbring farming to mankind. Perhaps the seed-harvest-seed cycle reminded these earlypeoples of the actions of their resurrecting god.The ‘Dynastic Race’As with Sumeria, there is a tendency to overlook the morphological and skeletalresearch of the past because it often carried racial implications that have not beenborne out by the subsequent century of scientific research. Early Egyptologists suchas Flinders Petrie discovered dramatically different skeletons in high and low-borngraves at around the time the Dynastic Period was kicking off.Essentially, there are marked differences in morphology between thePredynastic burials and those found in the tombs around Saqqara, Abydos and Gizafrom 3,500 BCE to 3,000 BCE, and even on into the Fourth Dynasty when compared tothose found from the same time in Upper Egypt which are, unsurprisingly, more‘African.’ If we leave aside the scientifically useless term ‘race,’ we are still left withfurther physical evidence that the era that gave rise to the Old Kingdom building184"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"projects was a polyglot one of domestic and international influences upon culturesmoving at different speeds; cultures which – just to make it even less clear – seemedto invade one another regularly and declare their own sovereignty over all.In their report prepared for a controversial 1974 UNESCO symposium as partof the General History of Africa project (controversial because the African academicswere denied access to Egyptian skin samples held in museums for pigment analysis),Diop, Obenga, Leclant and Vercoutier make the following wise observation:A distinction should be drawn between race and culture. In its language, writingand mentality, there is no doubt that Egyptian civilization is first and foremostAfrican, even if, over the millenniums, it borrowed certain cultural elementsfrom its eastern neighbours. Its population, on the other hand, is clearly aproduct of the Nile valley’s position in the north-east corner of the Africancontinent. As a corridor between central Africa and the Mediterranean, forthousands of years a crossroads between the Africa of the Atlantic and EastAfrica, the Africa of the Red Sea, and between Ethiopia and the Indian Ocean, itwas the melting pot in which, from predynastic times, if not earlier, the variousprehistoric African types, and the occasional representative of the races of theeastern marches, met and mingled. It would be a vain and useless task to lookhere for a pure, primitive ‘race,’ or homogenous population.A good example of this would be mysterious Badari Culture, dating back toaround 5,000 BCE and located about halfway down the Nile. Badarians provide theearliest evidence of agriculture in the Nile Valley, they also fished, farmed – including(Asian) sheep – and evidently traded widely with the Near East, South Asia and Africa:shells from the Red Sea are found in abundance, ivory jewellery and figurines fromgreater Africa, basalt vessels from the Nile Delta and glazed soapstone beads fromsouthern Iran. Here is how Robert Temple describes them in Egyptian Dawn:One of the things I like about the Badarians is that they were great dog lovers.They buried their dogs with reverence, which makes them just the sort of chapsI approve of. A lot of people would have us believe that these Badarians werevery primitive folk, but there is one problem: their pottery. The amazing thing isthat their pottery was so brilliant that it was never really equalled or surpassedin the whole of later Egyptian history. Now, what do you make of that? Whathappens to the idea of ‘progress’?Within the Badarian sphere of influence, at Nekhen – better known asHierakonpolis – was found the famous Narmer Palette. Dating from 3,100 BCE or so,it describes the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. The monstrous imagery on the185"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"palette shows a clear Sumerian influence. Nekhen itself was the pre-eminent cultcentre for Horus. By 3,400 BCE there may have been up to 10,000 people living in thecity. All of this is to show that when we come to the re-dating of supposedly ‘OldKingdom’ sites and objects much early than the Third or Fourth Dynasty, we actuallyhave a lot of room to ‘back the truck into’ without resorting to alien or Atlanteandescriptions. Sophisticated cultures had been living at scale in the area, andparticipating in the wider ancient world, for millennia prior to ‘unification.’In a scenario redolent of the losing and accidental discovery of century-oldanthropological research on Rapa Nui, the earliest depictions of ‘unified royal power’in Egypt are older than the Narmer Palette and were discovered before it, in 1890.Archibald Sayce discovered and sketched some rock drawings from Nag el-Hamdulab – up river from Nekhen but before Elephantine – that appear to date from3,200 BCE – Dynasty 0 – but, based on the shape of the boats, could go back to 3,600BCE. Sayce’s sketches languished with some unpublished reports from the earlytwentieth century in the archive of Chicago House in Luxor until their examination in2009. (I only accidentally found the report in the British Library while looking forsomething else.)The inscriptions themselves are a series of six discrete vignettes depictingcommon royal activities such hunting, warfare and riverine or nautical processions.An unnamed king wearing the White Crown appears in three of them. He isaccompanied by a dog which could suggest a Badarian influence. Unlike most rockart, which tends to begin in the centre of the available space, these vignettes start atthe far right of the available flat surface and proceed to the left – just as one finds withscribes working with papyrus. According to the authors of the report, ‘The earliestrepresentation of royal power in Egypt: the rock drawings of Nag el-Hamdulab(Aswan),’ this probably indicates the artists were used to working in other, potentiallymore official media. It could suggest the presence of a royal infrastructuralbureaucracy – scribes, papyri, etc. – at a much earlier date than we currently believe.Depictions of the royal boats are very compelling. In one, we see bowmen andprisoners next to a boat that has two cabins, each with a figure holding a large stick onit. The two boats in the royal nautical procession have many oars and oarsmen, aresickle-shaped, with the lower one depicting a bull standard on its prow. The lower boathas an exaggerated sickle shape with a single cabin on which stands a king wearingthe White Crown. The standard on the royal barge depicts Wepwawet, the ‘Opener ofthe Ways.’ From the same article we read:The first tableau is the largest at Nag el-Hamdulab, and is already for that186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"reason of primary importance. The scene is organised around five boats, four ofwhich are grouped in a row, slanting slightly upwards to the right, while the fifthis placed at a higher position. Despite the size and importance of the boats, thefocal element of the tableau is the representation of the ruler, followed by a fan-bearer, and preceded by a dog and two standard bearers, situated above the onlyboat with an elaborately decorated cabin. The king wears the White Crown andholds a prototypical heqa-sceptre. Four of the five boats are of the regular,‘sickle-shaped’ type. On the most elaborately drawn, not by coincidence belowthe king, a falcon standard can be seen, while three of the boats have a standardwith bull horns. Both the falcon and the bull are royal symbols, emphasising theroyal character of the boats ... In front of the royal boats are four beardedpersons, their arms beside their bodies, holding a horizontal line representing arope. Although the rope does not touch the boat, the men most likely representpeople towing the boat, a theme that occurs regularly in rock art.Not only is the bull a royal symbol, it is also an astronomical one withresonances west toward Nabta Playa and, of course, east into Eurasia. The presenceof the royal hawk is highly suggestive of Nekhen, as are the dogs. These depictionsconjure in the mind a highly compelling spectacle of a victorious king, his barge pulledalong from the shore by his enemies, as part of the early dynastic, biennial ritual eventknown as the ‘Following of Horus,’ where the king would travel up and down the land,collecting taxes and generally demonstrating his kingliness. Other depictions ofbrewing and drinking beer, or women dancing with cattle, add to the impression of aRoyal Progress throughout the land. It actually sounds quite enjoyable, assuming youwere on the boat rather than pulling it.The ‘Following of Horus’ should be familiar to those of you with even a casualunderstanding of ‘alternative Egyptology.’ It is very close to ‘Followers of Horus’ orshemsu hor. The four-hieroglyph inscription at Nag el-Hamdulab can be read eitherway. In the now-received ‘lore’ of alternative Egyptology, the shemsu hor werewisdom teachers who arrived in the land and imparted magical, legal andarchitectural knowledge to the indigenous population. The long length of the reign of theshemsu hor – 23,200 years, 31,400 years – makes it considerably more likely theseare a reflection of the Laurasian ‘era of the demigod rulers’ mytheme. But it isnevertheless interesting that we have unknown, vastly ancient rulers with an explicitastrotheology and clear influences from points east running the country at a time soremoved from the Pharaohs of later dynasties that they may as well be mythological. Isuspect that, at least in part, the shemsu hor story reflects a cultural memory of an eraprior to unification when the people of the city of Horus ran the show.187"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Digging in the right placeWe can back the ‘story truck’ up much, much further than Manetho’s arbitrarydynasties, but it is still generally believed that predynastic cultures such as theBadarians – who made world-beating pottery and traded globally – lived, for somereason, in wooden or mud houses that have no longer survived. Thus, there stillremains the matter of the otherwise-instantly-appearing megalithic building projects.I suspect, just as we find in India, these priceless ancient sites are unfortunatelylocated underneath other priceless ancient sites. In 1997, Hungarian archaeologistsundertook an examination of a temple on Thoth Hill, outside Thebes. Underneath theMiddle Kingdom site were the remains of an Archaic Period temple aligned to Sirius.The intervening millennia meant that, thanks to the effects of precession, the twolayers are slightly out of alignment with each other. Evidence of similar rebuilding hasbeen found at Dendera and on Elephantine. We are probably looking at some regularand widely distributed repurposing of earlier sites. By the time of the Middle Kingdom,there were ‘laws’ against reusing older temples. Specifically, the dead king wouldannounce that he had not reused old temple stones while his heart was being weighedin the Court of Osiris.In 2008, Juan Antonio Belmonte – whose Göbekli Tepe alignments werereferenced in an earlier chapter – participated in a satellite survey of 400 sites in Egyptand the Sudan, the majority of which were astronomically aligned. Given the definitivebreak provided by the First Intermediate Period, the destruction it would have wrought,and the subsequent Middle Kingdom rebuilding or repurposing of earlier sacred sites,we will likely never know just when large scale megalithic projects began. We doknow that mudbrick pyramids were being built in one part of the country while themagnificent Step Pyramid at Saqqara was being built in another, so again, we aredealing with different speeds of technological innovation.Dating to at least the First Dynasty and presumably earlier – not that anyone hasreally looked – is the ancient ‘city’ of Letopolis or ‘Khem’ in Egyptian. Now buriedunder a decidedly unlovely Cairo suburb, it was originally sacred to Horus the Elder.Based on the research of Georges Goyon, King Farouk’s private archaeologist and asenior fellow at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, Robert Bauvalbelieves Letopolis was once the home of an astronomical observatory tower. Romangeographer, Strabo, specifically mentions that it was from this site, ‘Eudoxus’ in theLetopolite Nome, that sightings and observations of celestial bodies was recorded.188"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"fig. 15Isometric view of Giza Plateau,Letopolis and HeliopolisSignificantly, the emblem of the Letopolite Nome was the ‘Bull’s Thigh’ or UrsaMajor. Bauval also points out that ‘Horus of Letopolis’ was the traditional keeper of theadze – shaped like the Plough – that was used in the ‘Opening of the Mouth’ ceremony.These sky/ground alignments and indications of a multi-site building projectacross Egypt right at the very start of the dynastic period are highly suggestive of apredynastic origin for the wider cosmology that they express. Indeed, that is the entirepremise of this book. Returning to Belmonte’s archaeoastronomical survey of Egyptand the Sudan, here is what he had to say about Meskhetyu, the Egyptian term forUrsa Major, and its ability to confer immortality in Ancient Egyptian belief.The archaeoastronomy mission fieldwork in the country, particularly in the fieldsof pyramids, seem to confirm this fact, provided Meskhetyu could also be theprincipal celestial object used to align these imposing monuments as well asmany other imposing temples along the Nile Valley, such as Dandara or Edfu.Consequently, the architectural arrangement of the pyramids could be a transferon Earth of the cosmic order prevailing in the sky.189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"UNAVOIDABLE HARD SCIENCEToo often when Egyptologists are rejecting scientifically verified dates forobjects or artefacts that appear earlier than their dynastic guesswork, their responserequires us to believe that there was very little going on in Egypt prior to unification.We have seen this is a patent misread of their own evidence, as well as a misread ofhow the Egyptians themselves saw their own history. Sandwiching enormous,interconnected building projects such as those found on the Giza Plateau into a centuryor less, and then refusing to budge, is a recipe for attracting Ancient Aliens film crews.Honestly admitting that there was significantly more cultural complexity inpredynastic Egypt, and an equally significant cultural continuity prior to unification andthe first few centuries that followed it, makes the appearance of the Old Kingdom lessgrotesquely aberrant, but no less inspirational.The following hard scientific data (a small selection) fall outside the arbitrarilydefined dynastic chronology of modern Egyptology but, owning to their status as factsrather than opinions, they must be incorporated into a proposed model of Egyptianhistory, lest it become entirely dysfunctional.Dating of the PyramidsThe fact that the Giza pyramids have actually been scientifically dated is notcommonly known. In the 1980s, the University of Washington’s Robert Wenke,working out of the American Research Center in Cairo, carbon dated some mortar –containing charcoal, wood and reed – from between the exterior stones of thepyramids for testing at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas and the FederalTechnical University in Zurich. The dates yielded were an average of 374 years olderthan the presumed dates of the Fourth Dynasty, averaging around 3,101 BCE withsome dates from the upper courses of the Great Pyramid yielding a date of almost4,000 BCE (margin of error: 160 years).More recently, Robert Temple dated the Great Pyramid to around or slightlybefore 3,000 BCE, using a dating method invented by nuclear physicist Ioannis Liritzisknown as ‘optical thermoluminescence.’ Whilst this cannot date the age of a stonestructure – nothing can – it does date the last exposure to sunlight of two stones thathave been pressed together which, in the case of a pyramid, is probably quite useful.All of these dates cluster around the 3,100 BCE to 3,000 BCE area, centuries tooold for the Fourth Dynasty and straddling that curious ‘between space’ of predynastyand dynasty. As an aside, in the final years of his reign, Hawass banned all scientificdating outside of Egypt.190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Constraint AnalysisConstraint analysis is an engineering technique to determine where thebottlenecks lie in a building project. That is, which steps in a construction cannot bemade to go faster and/or also hold up the rest of the project.In the case of extracting an obelisk from a quarry using only dolerite pounders,the bottleneck is in the original ‘dig down’ phase, which cannot be made to go fasterthan a single worker’s fastest speed. Aerospace machinist, Christopher Dunn, hascalculated that it would take just under 50 years to remove and shape a large, NewKingdom obelisk from a quarry using only dolerite pounders. Hatshepsut boasted ofgetting them out in six months.With specific reference to the Great Pyramid, the descending passage, carvedout of the Giza plateau’s limestone bedrock, is only 42 inches square, meaning thatonly one worker at any one time could be carving it out. This provides a neat andmeasurable example of constraint analysis: it would have taken almost twice Khufu’sreign for a single person to carve out this passageway using a dolerite pounder, andthat is working twenty four hours a day. Not only is the pyramid too old to be a tomb,its construction cannot fit into the twenty-something year reign of Khufu.The Osiris ShaftThe famous ‘Osiris Shaft’ beside and under the Khafre Causeway was clearlyconstructed in different stages across several millennia – with the deepest layer,somewhat confusingly, being the youngest. However, in Egyptian Dawn, RobertTemple and Ioannis Liritzis dated the 25 tonne dacite sarcophagus in the middlechamber to the predynastic era.Perhaps more interestingly, there is not a dacite vein anywhere in the continentof Africa large enough to have had a single, 25 tonne sarcophagus carved out of it,meaning this predynastic object is also an international import. Due to the propertiesof the stone, it is also slightly radioactive, which meant any biological material placedinside would have benefited from a mild increase in preservation, as the environmentinside the sarcophagus would have been antimicrobial.All of this speaks of a substantial awareness of the properties of various stonesand minerals, at an extremely early date, across ancient borders. Surprising though itis on first read, it is less surprising when put into the context of the prior ten millenniaor so of Laurasian megalithic spirituality.Further evidence in stone191"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Tens of thousands of pots, a great many of which date from the First Dynasty,were discovered under the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, believed to date from the ThirdDynasty. Much of this pottery is made from supremely hard stone that is physicallyimpossible to be shaped with copper.Similarly, the famous and stunning statue of Khafre in the Egyptian Museum inCairo is made of diorite, which is harder than steel. It has no tool marks.Lastly, if any of the few dozen alleged new pyramids discovered via satellite andGoogle Earth in the western desert over the last few years turn out to be verified, thenwe are clearly playing an entirely different, and much older, game. As is commonlyknown now, the limestone of the Sphinx and its enclosure displays significant waterdamage over a very long period of time.OSIRISA common criticism levelled at Robert Bauval’s Orion Correlation theory in itsearly days was that Osiris is not mentioned by name anywhere in the Old Kingdombefore the Fifth Dynasty. How could the three main Giza pyramids represent his beltstars, then, much less the stones of Nabta Playa?However, this is a misread of the available evidence. In her classic The Death ofGods in Ancient Egypt, Jane B. Sellers points out that not only were most, if not all, theother main characters of the Osiris myth – Set, Isis, Horus, Anubis and Thoth –attested to from predynastic times, but a complete telling of the story was not writtendown anywhere in all of dynastic Egypt, so its exclusion prior to the Fifth Dynasty isnot all that unusual. She suggests that perhaps the story was so widely known that itwas taken as given by most Egyptians. Most sources cite Plutarch for renditions of themyth, which was penned thousands of years after the end of the Old Kingdom. Here isSellers’s encapsulation of the story:Osiris was ruler of Egypt. Isis was his sister-wife, and Seth his evil brother.Seth killed his brother, Osiris, and cast his body enclosed in a coffer into theNile. Isis rescued the coffer and hid it: Seth found it, cut up the body into fourteenpieces and scattered them about Egypt. The grieving Isis wandered all over thecountryside, gathering up the parts of her husband’s body and then, with the helpof Nephthys, her sister; Anubis, the jackal-headed god of embalming; and Thoth,god of wisdom and words, put together the dismembered body, wrapping it inlinen bandages and uttering sacred words, or magical spells. Then Isis fannedthe body of Osiris with her wings and revived him long enough to conceive thechild Horus.192"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Further supporting the antiquity of the Osiris story are the numerous Laurasianmotifs such as the duelling brothers and separation of their earth/sky parents. Thereare also some viscerally shamanic and probably Gondwanan layers we shall return toas well, such as the ritual dismemberment and being stored/hidden in a tree trunk.That said, by the time we reach the Pyramid Texts of the Fifth Dynasty, the legend isdecidedly astrotheological, not only in the identification of Isis with Sirius and Osiriswith Orion, but also Osiris’s fourteen parts corresponding to the fourteen days of thewaning moon.It is certainly true that, beginning in the Middle Kingdom, Osiris took on a muchmore obvious role as Lord of the Underworld and Judge of Souls and Hearts. But thiswould be in keeping with my thesis that the newly ‘democratised’ religion of theMiddle Kingdom was an ‘incomplete rebuild,’ following the First Intermediate Period,of a previous – and vastly older – elite Mystery process with very obvious shamanicroots discussed below. The analogy to Christianity is apt: it can be described as aconfused assemblage of disparate Classical Mystery traditions built for a wideraudience.Prior to this change, Osiris’s role was not exclusively post-mortem. The kingdid not merely become Osiris when he died but, as described in the Pyramid Texts,was ritually identified with him in life. This may actually reflect a shamanic need to‘claim’ the unseen world as well as the seen world as part of one’s ‘total’ realm. It wasonly from the Middle Kingdom onwards that he was depicted as a mummified god; areligious innovation and, I contend, an over-simplification.Osiris the ForeignerMost Egyptologists would agree that that Osirian myth cycle is likely anagglomeration of mythemes: Horus/Set, Osiris/Horus and Osiris/Isis. However thisawareness is less often used in an examination of the pre-Fifth Dynasty origins ofOsiris.Much of this is down to nomenclature. The first written example of Osiris’s latername is found in the Pyramid Texts: the hieroglyphs are those of a seat and an eye.But in J. Gwyn Griffiths’s The Origins of Osiris and his Cult, he notes that the earliestappearance of Osiris’s name has three elements: the seat, the eye and, a classifier,the seated bearded man. The beard is a signifier of foreignness and the sitting postureone of status, so ‘seated, bearded figure’ was, and remained, a signifier for ‘non-slaveforeigner.’ In addition, in the vast majority of cases when a toponym is mentioned in anepithet of Osiris, ‘Busiris’ is mentioned, rather than his generally accepted ‘home’ of193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Abydos. Busiris is an area of Egypt that extends north from Giza to Saqqara andencompasses several vast Old Kingdom and predynastic necropoli.Given the skeletal evidence of additional cultures appearing at the beginning ofthe dynastic period, genetic and trade contacts tracing back millennia aross the NearEast, Southern and Southeast Asia, the appearance of the constellation Orion in stoneand mythological form going back tens of millennia and the belief that it was Osiriswho taught mankind agriculture, just as the same constellation did in the Pacific (thesame theme I believe is demonstrated at Göbekli Tepe) I put it to you that this littlehieroglyphic qualifier may well be the proverbial finger in the dyke.At this juncture, I suggest you mark a different break point in your internalchronology. Rather than starting off the story of Egypt at the First Dynasty and have itgrow in complexity from there, start it with the climate events that accompanied theend of the last Ice Age, which brought new agragian species and new cultures to theNile Valley, see it grow in cultural and technological complexity to peak around 3,100BCE to 2,800 BCE and then have it ‘decline’ for the last couple of Dynasties into theFirst Intermediate Period. (Consider this: a culture that only recently built the GreatPyramid would presumably be difficult to invade. A culture that had built it centuriesbefore and was now rattling around the edges of its previously impressive monumentswould be far easier to invade. Modern Britain is a good go-to example.)Put the break point at the First Intermediate Period and have the ‘reset’ andclimb back into cultural complexity occur at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom –with the bewildered descendants attempting to piece together a culture they had onlyever heard about after one and a half centuries of violence and destruction – and itstarts to make a bit more sense.PYRAMIDSSo far, only two undisturbed ‘burial chambers’ from the Old Kingdom pyramidshave been found. The earliest and most impressive is that of Sekhemkhet, beneath hisunfinished step pyramid at Saqqara. When the room was excavated in 1950, abeautiful, translucent alabaster tomb was discovered, still sealed. When opened, thesarcophagus was revealed to be empty. Atop it were the remains of plant material,suggestive of rejuvenation, and pottery discovered elsewhere in the complex referredto his Heb Sed festival.The second comes from another unfinished pyramid at Zawiyet el-Aryan, nearGiza, believed to ‘belong’ to the Fourth Dynasty Nebka. Again, the undisturbed ‘burialchamber’ contained a sarcophagus with a lid sealed with mortar and covered in clay. It194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"was also empty.Sekhemkhet was a king of the Third Dynasty, at the beginning of the OldKingdom. The only (presumably) contemporaneous remains inside a pyramid comefrom the end of the Old Kingdom, in the pyramid of Djedkare Isesi. A destroyed,granite sarcophagus and the remains of a human male of approximately fifty yearswere discovered inside the pyramid known as ‘Beautiful is Djedkare.’ Confusingly, theage of the corpse does not align with any of the known reigns of Djedkare from thevarious king lists, and his wife and children are known to have been buried elsewhere,at Abusir and Giza rather than Saqqara. Other remains inside Djedkare’s pyramidalso reference his Heb Sed festival, including an alabaster vase now on display in theMusée du Louvre. That said, several of the other Sixth Dynasty pyramids near that ofDjedkare Isesi have been found to contain canopic jars, suggesting that – at least bythe very end of the Old Kingdom prior to its complete collapse – humans, and possiblyroyal ones, were interred in pyramids. This does not preclude the structures havingsome other ritual function during the life of the king, rather it suggests a culturalchange that could have accompanied the general decline of society.En masse, Egyptologists will insist that pyramids are the looted tombs of OldKingdom rulers. Interrogate them individually, however – something I have made ahabit of doing in London – and they will admit that this is really a ‘best guess’ as totheir function. Not only have no satisfactory remains been uncovered in any of thesestructures, even in cases such as those of Sekhemkhet, where the objects haveremained unmolested for millennia, but we are also faced with the problem thatindividual kings built multiple pyramids. This is explained away as a ruse to confoundtomb robbers, but the logic behind that does not stack up. Firstly, it’s an absurd wasteof resources better spent simply maintaining guards at the actual tomb. Secondly,prior to the building of pyramids, and in every era after it, there are no examples ofpharaohs building ‘false tombs’ in, for example, the Valley of the Kings. If this ‘anti-burglary’ method was official policy, why does it only apply to pyramids?In addition, we also have numerous unfinished pyramids. These are explainedaway by saying that the king died before his pyramid was completed. Again, this failslogical analysis. Surely the completion of a tomb is more important once a king hasdied? There is simply no way the next ruler, in all likelihood a relative, would haverisked unbalancing Maat and attracting the ire of the gods by failing to completeconstruction of the tomb of his ancestor. I would go so far as to say their coronationwould be illegitimate if they had behaved in such a fashion.

A better and now more appropriatename for them would be ‘royal temples’ or ‘temples of the royal cult.’ Calling themsuch probably gets us closer to an improved understanding of their function.The pyramid at SaqqaraFirstly, many of them appear to have been in use during the reign of the king,which would be unusual for a mortuary temple. Secondly, many kings built more thanone. Sneferu built at least four, including one at the so-called Bent Pyramid whichclearly never had a funerary function. It does make reference to the Heb Sed festival,however, and this points us in a better direction.Heb SedYou are never more conscious of the paucity of magical or ritual knowledgeamong mainstream historians than when reading their interpretations of the Heb Sed196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"festival. This is described as a sort of ritualised running race performed by the king inthe thirtieth year of his reign and then every three or four years after that. During theOld Kingdom he would attach a tail to his garment and be presided over by priests inleopard skins, which it is reasonable to suggest are vestiges of an earlier shamanictradition. Clearly there is something else going on besides renewing the vitality of anageing king, especially as the festival could be held at what appear to be arbitrarytimes in addition to the classic thirty year interval. In his Shamanic Wisdom in thePyramid Texts, Dr Jeremy Naydler puts it like so:A major part of the festival consisted in the king visiting the shrines of theassembled gods of Egypt. These gods, made present in their statues, werebrought ceremonially to the festival site from all over Egypt. They representedthe spiritual energies of the landscape, which were embodied in the human andsemihuman forms of their divine statues. The king was thus engaged in a ritualcommunion with the spirits of the land of Egypt. The underlying purpose of thiswas to reach across to the more subtle spiritual world that upholds and vitalizesthe physical world, in order to ensure a beneficent connection with it and anunhampered flow of energies from it to the physical.When you consider that the king was the divine mediator between the spiritworld and the physical world for the entire country – the state-appointed shaman, ifyou will – much of the symbolism and architecture of pyramid complexes becomesclearer. The Heb Sed’s main ritual was designed to bring the king into consciousalignment with the various forces of the spirit world and ‘renew’ their terrestrialconnection. Thus the final running race or ‘Sed dance’ is not an assessment of anageing king’s cardiovascular capacity. As he crosses a courtyard laid out withsymbolic waymarkers of his kingdom this is actually a ritual revitalisation of thewhole land. He crosses over all Egypt, as do the stars with which he has just beenmagically identified. Here is Jane B. Sellers’s description of the Heb Sed:Perhaps held on the first day of the first month of the ‘Season of Coming Forth’and preceded by five days dedicated to the Osirian Mysteries, these particularrituals appear to be a renewal of the king’s ancient right to rule both Upper andLower Egypt ...From almost the very beginning of Egypt’s written history we have whatappears to be renderings of Sed rituals. A simple, schematic representation ofFirst-Dynasty King Den depicts the king apparently involved in the runningceremony of ‘The Dedication of the Field,’ or ‘Circuit of the Wall.’ King Zoser isrepresented in a Third-Dynasty rendering of this same ritual, and from the Fifth197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"•••Dynasty we have inscriptions from the walls of Niuserre’s sun temple at AbuGurob showing the king performing the same rites.A mace head of Narmer is an even earlier indication of the antiquity of the‘Hebsed’ (or Sed Festival).At the conclusion of the Heb Sed, the king received a ritual coronation on aspecially constructed dais, designed to represent the Primordial Mound. It wasstepped, like a stairway leading up to the stars. Like a pyramid. Returning to DrNaydler:The crowning itself was a cosmic event that was regarded as accomplishing theunion of the Above with the Below, thereby infusing the earth with the fructifyingenergies of the spirit realm. This union of heaven and earth during the coronationceremonies was accompanied by these words, spoken by an attendant priest:Horus appears resting on his southern throne, and there occurs a uniting of thesky to the earth.The same formula was repeated once for each of the four cardinal directionstoward which the king duly turned.When you consider the antiquity of the Heb Sed, its obvious astronomical anddirectional alignments and the association of the ‘right to rule’ as well as thereordering of the cosmos with its successful completion, you see the clear parallels toVedic and Polynesian rituals designed to accomplish precisely the same thing.(Influxes of foreign overlords are unsurprisingly rigorous in providing themselves withmagical and ceremonial legitimacy.) These parallels will only become more obvious.A revised architectural chronologyDe-emphasising the ‘funerary hypothesis’ of the purpose of pyramids invites usto consider a new chronology. Without it, we are left with:Predynastic Egypt: Kings buried in tombs.Early Dynastic Egypt: Mudbrick pyramids appear. Kings remain buried intombs.Old Kingdom Egypt: Some kings buried in stepped pyramids, others buried nearpyramids, away from the rest of their family. Tombs get larger, then muchsmaller, but are still only for some kings. Others continue to be buried in tombs.In the final two dynasties, writing appears inside the ‘pyramid tombs’ for the first198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"•time, even though writing is attested to from actual tombs in earlier dynasties.The ‘pyramid tombs’ from the final dynasty are a poor echo of some of theearlier masterpieces.The rest of Egyptian history: Kings buried in tombs.If we allow that the pyramids had some ritual magical function during the life ofthe king, then we also have a better fit for what Robert Temple calls ‘a logic of decline.’The dating of the Great Pyramid puts much of it at or just before the dynastic era, afterwhich the astrotheological, megalithic building project appears to get less physicallyambitious; ending with some frankly underwhelming sites in the Sixth Dynasty, atwhich point the country was invaded and collapsed. Clearly a ritual change – a changein the magic – occurred in the final two dynasties with the appearance of writing, thePyramid Texts, for the first time inside these structures, which could be interpreted asa further ‘falling away’ from the original ritual function. (Think of the liturgical changesassociated with various translations of the Bible.) A revised chronology beckons.One final observation that may be significant before we examine these texts: iftheir primary purpose was not funerary, then the Egyptian pyramids would be broughtback into alignment with every other Laurasian culture – such as Sumeria andMesoamerica – that built them instead as calendrical ‘World Mountains’ or places ofascension and descent between the upper and earthly realm. Such a realignmentwould be in keeping with the discovery of a proto-stepped-pyramid, Gunung Padang,in Indonesia.A similar approach is called for when it comes to the Egyptian gods. As DrWitzel observes, there were four main variants of Egyptian myth, determined atvarious stages in the culture’s history by the respective priesthoods of Heliopolis,Memphis, Hermopolis and Thebes. This resulted in specific gods assuming the ‘leadactor’ role in the story. Historians and magicians are often tripped up by this,assuming there is some form of linear progression or evolution. A comparison of thefour main variations quickly throws the earlier, underlying ‘pan-Egyptian’ myth cycleinto sharp relief.THE PYRAMID TEXTSIs the Bible a funerary text? It is read at funerals. But it is also read at weddings,baptisms, state occasions, white power rallies, sporting events, during Eucharist,before procreative intercourse and – strange as it may seem – even just for fun.Beginning with the pyramid of Unas in the Fifth Dynasty, we find carved199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"throughout the interior of several of the final few Old Kingdom pyramids the so-called‘Pyramid Texts,’ considered among the world’s oldest religious writings. Undoubtedly,many of the spells and incantations that comprise the Pyramid Texts have a funeraryfunction. Our best evidence for this is the fact that a goodly number of them surviveinto the ‘Books of the Dead’ in the New Kingdom, which is inarguably an exclusivelyfunerary or post-mortem spell book. There is also the fact that the king is regularlyreferred to as ‘Osiris’ in the Pyramid Texts. What is less widely known is that he isreferred to as ‘Horus’ equally as often, suggesting the king’s magical identificationwith the divine is not exclusively related to his afterlife state.Based on his PhD thesis, Dr Naydler’s Shamanic Wisdom in the Pyramid Textspresents a hugely compelling argument that what we call the Pyramid Texts (PT) arerelated to the same spiritual function that underpins the Heb Sed; namely that the king,while living, passes into the afterlife and returns; the classic shamanic journey.Consider the following PT utterance:I am Horus, my father’s heir.I am the one who went and came back ...From Dr Naydler’s book:Elsewhere it is as Horus that the king ‘rests in life in the West (i.e., theUnderworld)’ and then, like the sun, ‘shines anew in the East.’ In both these passages,a nonfunerary interpretation in which the king mystically ‘dies’ by entering into andthen returning from the realm of the dead is just as plausible as a funeraryinterpretation. But however we interpret them, their existence is incontrovertibleevidence that the ‘dead’ king is not always an Osiris.In many respects, the suggestion that the PT are exclusively funereal is strangerthan suggesting their principal function was a Mystery one. Dr Naydler keenlyobserves that there are similar Mystery ritual practices occurring incontemporaneous cultures to the Middle and New Kingdoms, such as those of theMinoans, Hittites, and Ugarites. Given the prominence afforded to Egypt by the rest ofthe ancient world as the home of deep magical wisdom and power, the absence ofwhat would become known in the Classical Age as a Mystery initiation should bemore surprising than its presence.In this analysis, the shamanic motifs of the PT, and indeed the majority of thepyramids themselves, are thrown into stark relief. Just as the antiquity of the Heb Sedis suggested by the therianthropic ritual garments of the king and the priests, PT200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"descriptions suggest a ‘classic’ shamanic experience. From utterance 373:Oho! Oho! Raise yourself up, O King; receive your head,Collect your bones, gather your limbs together,Throw off the earth from your flesh....[H]e sets you at the head of the spirits, the Imperishable Stars.Those whose seats are hidden worship you,The Great Ones care for you, the Watchers wait upon you.Barley is threshed for you, emmer is reaped for you,And offering thereof is made at your monthly festivals,Offering thereof is made at your half-monthly festivals,Being what was commanded to be done for you by your father, Geb.Rise up, O King, for you have not died!Ritual dismemberment remains a dominant motif in many initiatory traditions tothis day and may ultimately date back to the very beginning of the formation of theLaurasian storyline (and perhaps earlier) where the universe is created from thedismembered parts of a giant monster or ancient god. It is quite possibly a very earlyconceptualisation of the microcosm/macrocosm connection of the ‘unified human’with all of Creation. The most potent visual is, of course, the removal and then returnof the head, a seat of power recognised in magic and sorcery for tens of millennia,which is – I posit – reflected in the faceless (headless) T- shaped pillars of GöbekliTepe and, of course, the ‘headless hunter’ that is Orion itself. From an Egyptian ritualperspective, when Osiris is headless, he is in the Underworld. The restoration of hishead corresponds with his restoration to the Living world thanks to the magic ofIsis/Sirius.The king is repeatedly exhorted to ‘claim the throne’ of Osiris. Returning to DrNaydler:Underlying the whole question of the king acquiring the throne, whether as201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Osiris or Horus, is the significant fact that several of the Pyramid Texts areclearly linked to, derived from, or are versions of coronation texts. Utterance213 is illustrative:O King, you have not departed dead,You have departed alive.Sit upon the throne of Osiris, your sceptre in your hand,That you may give orders to the living;Your lotus-bud sceptre in your hand, that you may give ordersTo those whose seats are hidden.Your arms are Atum, your shoulders are Atum, your belly is Atum,Your back is Atum, your hind-parts are Atum, your legs are Atum,Your face is Anubis.The Mounds of Horus serve you,The Mounds of Set serve you.Here, the king not only ‘departs alive,’ but he does so in order to claim the throneof Osiris and ‘give orders to the living.’ His dismembered body is reformed as Atum –meaning ‘complete one’ – with the face of the god who presides over the comings andgoings between the realms. As a result, the assembled forces and settlements ofcreation and destruction now serve him.Perhaps significantly, Horus was ruler of the fertile lands and Set was ruler ofthe desert. Hence the utterance would not look out of place in a Heb Sed ritual wherethe king ‘claims’ his territories. Leaving that aside, the utterance looks for all the worldlike the archetypal journey of the shaman into the Otherworld, his recognition there,and then his return and subsequent installation as tribal mediator between the realms.According to the early twentieth century Egyptologist, Alexandre Moret, the living kingbecame divine precisely because he had been magically identified with Osiris; hisaccession to the throne required him to be ‘redeemed’ as Osiris had been. Thecomplete lack of royal mummies in the pyramids begins to make more sense in thislight. Yes, the king probably got in the sarcophagus. But he also probably got back out.202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"With a particular emphasis on the Pyramid of Unas, Dr Naydler not onlyexamines the content of the utterances, but their specific location carved onto the wallsand ceilings of the various chambers of the structure. From a ritual magicperspective, this interpretation is hugely useful, especially as it seems much morelikely that the vast majority of Old Kingdom pyramids had a ritual rather than funerealrole. What emerges from this analysis is a ritual space designed to accomplish thehugely important magical task of enabling the king to claim his sovereignty over theimmaterial realm by a process of stellar identification, literally going up into the starsand back again, so that cosmic balance, prosperity and wellbeing are restored toEgypt. Such a goal is almost identical to the goal of the Heb Sed, which is the likelyexplanation for why there are so many Heb Sed motifs, depictions and ritual objectsfound in and around so many pyramids. And also why a king would need more thanone.The magical acts, in particular the identification with Orion and the intercessionof Sirius (Isis), mean the king also has the ‘right’ and ‘magical ability’ to take his placeamong the Imperishable Stars upon his death. This is similar – although much cooler,obviously – to the way baptism ensures right of access to heaven.Naydler’s analysis of the location of utterances within Unas’s pyramid beginswith the location of the structure itself. The nine pyramids so far discovered thatcontain Pyramid Texts are clustered fairly close to each other at Saqqara, itself thenecropolis of the Old Kingdom capital of Memphis. Since the predynastic era, Saqqarawas associated with Sokar, considered by many to be an early manifestation of Osirisas well as the presiding deity of Memphis, Ptah. He writes:As a manifestation of Osiris, Sokar represented his power of rebirth, and wasdepicted as a falcon resting on, or breaking out of, a mound of earth, placed on aboat. The whole area then was as much to do with rebirth as it was to do withdeath.Significantly, Sokar combines a number of the more widespread Laurasianmotifs found in Sumeria, India and the Pacific. The bird/earth/ship motif, and theimplied Flood/Cosmic Waters motif, is found in the Noah story, Atrahasis and(sometimes in the form of a box of earth rather than a ship) Hindu mythology. Thisvery likely attests to an ultimate origin sometime in the Palaeolithic, appearing inpredynastic Egypt in the form of Sokar.Like all Ancient Egyptian sacred structures, the choice of construction materialwas deliberate and fulfilled a magical purpose. The sarcophagus is carved from asingle block of black basalt (the same stone used at Gunung Padang). The walls of the203"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 1 1‘burial chamber’ are of polished alabaster, upon which many of the PT utterances arecarved. Alabaster is almost translucent, and would have appeared quite evocative inthe torchlight of whatever ceremonies happened in the chamber. It would also contrastwith the deep black of the sarcophagus. Alabaster was referred to as ankh, meaning‘life.’ Ankh was ‘sap of life,’ one of the terms for milk; the ‘milk of heaven’ or the ‘milkof the Imperishable Stars’ is mentioned numerous times in the PT.The complex would have been approached by boat across an artificial lake,arriving at the ‘Valley Temple,’ before ascending the causeway into the ‘MortuaryTemple’ and then into the (Hed Sed?) courtyard and around to the entrance whichpoints north, toward the circumpolar stars.The Utterances of UnasThere are 228 utterances within the pyramid itself. Three are repeated severaltimes, bringing the total number to 234. Only two straddle more than one wall. It isunlikely the number of utterances has any significance as this particular way ofgrouping them dates back to their first publication in 1910. Indeed, most researcherssuspect a good amount of them ‘run together’ rather than operate as discrete ‘spells’such as those found in the New Kingdom Books of the Dead.

Nevertheless, in light of thecomplete absence of interred bodies, the Heb Sed imagery found in the majority ofpyramid complexes, the explicit astrotheological journey of ascending to the stars andreturning, it is hard to argue against Dr Naydler’s assertion that a broad ritual shapeemerges when you read the PT going from the sarcophagus out, rather than theentrance in. The balance of living/dead imagery also becomes much clearer.Just as we see in the Vedas, in Sumeria and Polynesia, there is a celestialascent, a presentation to or union with the stellar gods and then a return to earth.It is quite clear that the PT is older than their first appearance on the walls ofUnas’s pyramid. Some of the grammar has even been described as archaic whencompared to hieroglyphs that appear in secular use half a century before Unas.Probably the twentieth century’s preeminent authority on the Pyramid Age, I. E. S.Edwards, believed that the stellar spells in the Pyramid Texts had an entirely separateorigin to the solar spells, and that they eventually merged over time into what we callthe Heliopolitan cosmology.Over the course of the final few reigns of the Old Kingdom, some of the PTmotifs change and later pyramids begin to incorporate more contemporaneouslanguage. This happens at the same time as we start to see canopic jars appearing inthe pyramids, suggesting they were eventually used for burial. Depending on yourpoint of view, this is further evidence of either an inevitable mutation of cosmologiesover time or ‘falling away from a purer spiritual practice.’ If, as seems likely, the mainpurpose of the pyramids was as Heb Sed ritual zones, then we may speculate thatinterring the country’s ‘conduit’ between the physical and spirit realms in these‘magical window areas’ could have been triggered by the increasing unrest andinvasion Egypt was no doubt experiencing as the Old Kingdom drew to a close.Perhaps it was increasing desperation that required the dead kings to become‘permanent’ intermediaries?211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"In the final dynasties, we begin to see the appearance of a few scattered PTspells appearing in non-royal tombs. These non-royal spells are the ancestors of theso-called Coffin Texts that appear in the First Intermediate Period and MiddleKingdom alongside a democratised ‘afterlife for everyone’ where Osiris now sits inthe Hall of Judgement and determines your posthumous fate. But it is the earlier,slightly more savage magic that is of the most interest to us, as it sheds the best lighton the pyramids and rituals that preceded the Pyramid Texts.SAQQARAStaying in the same area – indeed it is right next door to Unas – we have thefamous Step Pyramid of Djoser, believed to be the earliest one built in stone. Althoughthat sequence is contraindicated by the scientific dating performed at Giza –suggesting that Khufu’s pyramid may be the older – the Step Pyramid’s associationwith Djoser and thus the Third Dynasty is not in doubt.Strange as it may seem to say so, the seven-levelled step pyramid is perhapsthe least impressive part of Djoser’s complex. The remarkable boundary wall, lookingcenturies old rather than millennia, is a true wonder of the ancient world. Encirclingthe boundary wall itself is something perhaps more impressive still.The ‘Dry’ MoatCalled a dry moat because there are compartments and other structures withinit, a three kilometre long channel encircles (or en-rectangles) Djoser’s complex andwas only discovered in 1985 by Egyptian archaeologist Nabil Swelim, whileexamining aerial photography taken during the 1920s. When in use, it would have beenforty metres wide and 25 metres deep at its deepest point. Three million tonnes wouldhave been excavated to construct the moat, which is greater than the volume of theStep Pyramid. Parts of it appear to date from the First Dynasty, which is not onlyastounding in and of itself, but says something important about the sanctity andlongevity of sanctity for the land within it. One does not pick these locations on a whim.Dr Nabil Swelim observed that the moat does not connect the whole way around, butinstead resembles the hieroglyph for ‘battlemented enclosure,’ and that it resemblesother, much smaller, moats around royal tombs from the First Dynasty. You will nodoubt observe that it also pulls up right in front of the complex, meaning the king couldstill ritually arrive by boat. Consensus Egyptology calls this ‘the Great Trench’ and ‘itsfunction seems to have been to make entry into the complex more difficult.’ Except ofcourse that it clearly doesn’t, and seems rather a lot of work to go toward a moat thatis defensively useless. As with the rest of the complex, it is aligned 4.35 degrees offtrue north. There is no evidence the moat was ever filled with water, but there is not212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"much evidence of anything, as it has never been fully excavated.The Boundary WallWhen considering Djoser’s complex, it needs to be remembered that, accordingto accepted Egyptological chronology, this is the first instance of large-scale,monumental stone building in the country, and perhaps anywhere on earth. This is likejumping straight from the horse and buggy to Tesla Motors with no intervening steps.The boundary wall is the proverbial space ship the History Channel has been lookingfor.Because it is not just its perfectly straight angles, corners and precisionmasonry, it is also that the boundary wall is a calendar calculating both the observedand actual Sothic cycle. These data have been calculated by the previously referencedastrophysicist, Thomas Brophy, and his co-author, Robert Bauval, in what is assuredlytheir best book, Imhotep the African: Architect of the Cosmos.213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"fig. 18Djoser complexIn between the 14 false doors – to which we shall return – there are 4,383214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"•••perfectly vertical, structurally redundant, ‘panels’ around the boundary wall. However,these are not evenly distributed.West side: 1,461 panelsEast side: 1,458 panelsNorth and south sides: 732 panels each (366 x 2)Bauval noticed these numbers relate to the Sothic Cycle, which is the number ofyears it takes for Sirius to return to a heliacal rising position:[T]his number [1,461] represented the return of the New Year in the 365-daycalendar to the heliacal rising of Sirius. But this number was arrived at byassuming an exact ¼ day to add to the 365-day calendar and simply multiplyingby four. In other words, this Sothic Cycle was not observed, but calculated. Thetrue or actual length of the Sothic Cycle for the period beginning C. 4226 BCEand ending C. 2767 BCE was, in fact, worked out by British astronomer M. F.Ingham, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. Ingham, who was of coursewell aware that the length of the Sothic Cycle would change slightly due to theprecession of Sirius and the Proper Motion of the star, worked out that the‘Sothic year’ (the days it took between two heliacal risings of Sirius) would havebeen 365.25025 days in that epoch, giving an actual Sothic Cycle of 1,458.5 ...which Ingham rounded to 1,458.So the western wall contains the civic calculation of a Sothic Cycle and theeastern wall contains the actual Sothic Cycle. As for the north and south walls, 366was the number of days in the leap year when the heliacal rising of Sirius wouldresynchronise with the solar year. And, of course, there are four times 366. A leap yearoccurs every four years.The 1,461:732 ratio of the boundary wall comes close to 2:1 and also creates anangle of 26°30’ which is the same angle used in the descending passage of the StepPyramid itself, as well as some nearby mastabas. Bauval continues:If a rectangle is drawn within a circle representing the horizon, such that thecorners of the rectangle denote the azimuths of the rising and setting sun at thesolstices, then it will have the same nearly 2:1 ratio. From a metaphoricviewpoint, the rectangle would represent the domain of the sun.As for those 14 false doors?

It is at Saqqarathat the inevitable fixation on the physical looks the most absurd. Just as theconstruction skills need to come from somewhere, so too must the story theEgyptians were telling in stone. We see here at the beginning of Egypt the lunisolarcalendar we find in Egypt and Harappa, with the addition of some exciting local flavour.Inside the Boundary WallsThe pyramid, the boundary wall and the dry moat are all aligned 4.35 degrees offtrue north for reasons that will become clear. However the Saqqara site is itselfevidently part of the wider Early Dynastic building project only now emerging intoview. It is situated at the apex of an isosceles triangle with its base points at Letopolis –described above as home to astronomer priests – and Heliopolis, home of the ancientsun cult. The apex angle bisects at 16.5 degrees, which is also the angle of the sides ofthe Step Pyramid itself. Giza, Letopolis and Heliopolis also form a ‘perfect’ right-angled triangle in this same system.‘Sun cult’ only tells part of the story of Heliopolis, as the high priest was knownas the ‘Chief of the Astronomers’ and is depicted wearing a mantle covered in stars. InEgyptian cosmology the stars are rarely more important than during their heliacalrising, which is a solar action, obviously. Thus it seems likely that the Victorianantiquarian obsession with assuming everything is a solar cult underemphasises howinterconnected these spiritual systems really are. (It is also worth remembering thatour sun is, of course, a star.) The site for Djoser’s complex was selected by Imhotep,one of the few sages of antiquity we can be reasonably certain actually existed.According to Christian Jacq, Imhotep was very likely an initiate of the Heliopolisschool. Pieces of a wider plan beyond a hypothesised burial of an absolute monarchcreep into view.The enclosed space within the boundary walls continues their precisionastrotheology. The space inside is unquestionably the site of Djoser’s Heb Sedfestival. Once again, we find no evidence of a burial anywhere, and all the depictions inthe complex and pyramid relate instead to the festival. The site contains robingchambers, chapels for the various regional gods that would ‘visit’ for the festival, ithouses a coronation dais and the large open courtyard for the king’s ritual runningrace.There are two parallel rows of 24 columns inside the complex, running for 54216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"metres. 24 was the number of hours in an Egyptian day. The rows of columns alsoform 18 niches each side, for a total of 36. This is the number of decans in the skycalendar. Whilst it is commonly assumed that the decans first appeared in the MiddleKingdom, the presence of the number 36 in what Bauval refers to as ‘Cape Canaveralin stone,’ right at the very beginning of the Dynastic Project suggests otherwise. Wereturn to Jane B. Sellers:By 2100 BCE, thirty-six star gods had been set in relation to this civil calendarand these gods of the heaven appeared on coffin lids, each god occupying aspecific position on the chart or sky clock for 10-day intervals, or one tenth of thesky. It has been determined that the stars chosen for this purpose occupied thezone roughly parallel to, but south of, the path of the sun, and that of these 36decans, the star god Sahu-Orion, along with Sothis (our Sirius), was the mostimportant.Putting some further context around the implications of the antiquity of thedecans is Jake Stratton-Kent in his splendid The Testament of Cyprian the Mage:It is still impossible to improve on the succinct comments of Frances Yates: Intothe Hellenic astrology which is the background of the philosophical Hermeticaan Egyptian element had been absorbed, namely the thirty-six decans ... [which]were really Egyptian sidereal gods of time who had become absorbed in theChaldean astrology and affiliated to the zodiac. Thus the decans originate withthe ancient Egyptians, whose year began with the heliacal rising of the starSothis (Sirius) in Cancer. The corresponding decan was attributed to Sothis,who ‘looked back’ at the decans to come.[...]Initially independent of the zodiac, in the Ptolemaic era these decans wereassimilated to the Greco-Babylonian system: they have been a feature ofWestern astrology ever since.We will return to the idea in the chapters to follow, but if we find the decans, stilla feature of western magic to this day, at the very beginning of the Dynastic project,then their ultimate origins are, in fact, far older than the remains of King Djoser,wherever he was buried.Djoser’s Step PyramidIf it turns out that the pyramid is much older than the boundary wall I would notbe the least bit surprised. The condition of the structure is positively ruinous. Mysuspicion is some of its subterranean components and bottom layers are probably217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"predynastic and date to the time of the construction of the dry moat. First Dynastypottery has been found in abundance inside the complex and in the pyramid itself.The base of the Step Pyramid is almost square but not quite, and is slightlyoffset from the exact centre of the enclosure. Its subterranean features are quiteimpressive, dominated by a large vertical shaft and a veritable warren of corridorsand niches. (Hawass estimated the total length of the corridors to be over fivekilometres.) At the base of the large shaft is a granite room called the ‘burial chamber,’although there are no remains to make this case. It appears that this room had aceiling or at least part of a ceiling of limestone blocks decorated with stars. Thesewere removed or destroyed during one of the structure’s ill-advised ‘reconstructions.’In a more complete state, the Step Pyramid would have had seven tiers, verylikely corresponding to the seven stars of Ursa Major. There is a good chance thepyramid was built in several different stages, which would be in keeping with a non-funerary interpretation, and would explain the various dimensional offsets.As previously mentioned, its sides are at an angle of 16.5 degrees. Looking tothe north, this means that the curious room known as the Serdab, appended to the sideof the pyramid, is also at 16.5 degrees. The north-facing wall of the Serdab has twoeyeholes, behind which peeped out a statue of Djoser, staring for eternity at a point inthe northern sky 4.35 degrees off from truth north at a height of 16.5 degrees – right atAlkaid, reaching its 16.5 degree azimuth just as Sirius was rising in the east.AlkaidThinking in cosmic terms, the ‘Pole Star’ is more of a job title than an actualstar. Due to precessional effects, the star closest to the pole changes over themillennia. During the Old Kingdom, the Pole Star was Alkaid. Curiously, it gets itsname from the Arabic qā’id bināt na’sh, meaning ‘Leader of the Daughters of the Bier.’There is an enigmatic suggestion of a survival of the esoteric function of Alkaid giventhe bier’s association with royal funerals in Ancient Egypt.GIZALittle commented upon, but probably quite important, is the geology of the GizaPlateau. It is comprised mostly of limestone, gently sloping southeast toward the Nile.The limestone itself is the remains of a reef that grew in the area when it was coveredby the ocean around 50 million years ago. Rainfall or underground tributaries, whencombined with carbon dioxide, erode limestone and tend to create large tunnel andcave systems when left alone for a few hundred millennia or so.218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Tunnel and cave systems at Giza are attested to from the age of Herodotus,through the first Victorian Egyptologists, down to seismic surveys in the late twentiethcentury, until the age of Hawass, who had a tendency to build padlocked metal gatesover their entrances and even, in one instance, allegedly concreted entirely over one. Itseems to me that the best answer to why, and potentially when, Giza became a sacredsite associated with the Dead is to be found in its geology. A tunnel and cave system onthe side of the river where the sun sets becomes both a map of the Underworld andthe literal underworld. In fact, one of the original names for the Giza area, Rostau,means ‘Mouth of the Passages,’ which is highly suggestive of subterraneity. I expectthat a rational, sober analysis of subsurface Giza would show ritual use stretchingback perhaps tens of millennia, as its association with the afterlife is attested to rightback to the Predynastic Era. This may go some way to explaining the dramaticallydifferent dates for objects and structures found on the plateau: yes, it was a hugelyimportant site in the Old Kingdom’s Fourth Dynasty, but its cultic significance is vastlyolder still. It may even be that we could find the progression from tunnel/cave use, toshaped tunnels/caves, to built tunnels/rooms that would provide a more coherentchronology. As to how they managed to select a sacred site that sits at the cross-section of the most land anywhere on earth, thousands of years in the past, that willkeep for a subsequent chapter.Giza’s spiritual significance was not just a domestic affair. We have alreadyseen that the twenty tonne Predynastic sarcophagus in the so-called Osiris Shaftwould have had to have been cut and transported from somewhere outside of Africa,but it also appears Giza was high on the ancient world’s spiritual tourism map. Whatwere previously called ‘workers’ villages’ are now believed to have beenaccommodation for highborn – and in some cases foreign – visitors. Travel wasperilous during the Old Kingdom and it is unlikely to have been motivated by the desireto rubberneck some distant tyrant’s pointy tomb. A magical motive, such as theconferring of immortality in life as promised by the later Mystery traditions, is morelikely. The evidence of foreign dignitaries is a better match for the idea that the GizaPlateau was known as a sacred site for a very long time. These new findings alsomean Egyptologists are now, once again, missing a Fourth Dynasty workforce of tensof thousands.Understanding that the wider site, rather than individual structures, had somesort of ritual significance allows us to begin to make sense of some of the dozens anddozens of mathematical interrelationships between the various pyramids, temples,and so on, because these are certainly in evidence. From the ratios of different sidelengths, to the shadows cast on certain days, to ‘invisible’ lines connecting various219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"•••points on the pyramid, the golden angle is everywhere found. In The Sphinx Mystery,Robert Temple writes:The mysterious plan of the Plateau of Giza ... is one of the most fantasticsurvivals of ancient Egypt, in some ways more remarkable than the pyramidsthemselves, since it actually embodies them within a larger scheme socomplex and ingenious that it reminds me of a modern computer program runamok. And it is a plan not only in two dimensions, but three as well ... [T]heSphinx and the Giza pyramids have a precise and direct relation with oneanother, a relation so specific that the monuments mutually determine oneanother’s position on the plateau. They form a unified complex.Just some of the several dozen golden angles connecting the largest Gizastructures are as follows. Temple again:Great Pyramid: all four corners, the top and three midpointsPyramid of Chephren: all four corners, the top and two midpointsPyramid of Mycerinus: two corners, the top, and one midpoint The decrease innumber of the salient midpoints in the progression 3, 2, 1 matches the degree ofhierarchical size of each pyramid in the group.We must not forget that the Great Pyramid itself is full of golden angles andgolden triangles and golden sections... the commencement of the Grand Galleryinside the Great Pyramid is, for instance, determined by a golden triangle. TheAscending Passage and the Descending Passage inside the Great Pyramid areboth golden slopes, each at the golden angle of 26° 33’ 54” to the horizontal plane... The King’s Chamber has multiple golden angles determining its size andshape.Those familiar with R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz’s Symbolist interpretation ofEgyptian thought, based principally on the angles and measurements of New Kingdomtemples, should not be surprised to see these same numbers and ratios appearing inthe much earlier Old Kingdom. The extremity of their expression at Giza, however, isunsurpassed elsewhere and is particularly significant given how long the plateau hasbeen a sacred site. These are old mathematics indeed. Or, as Temple writes:Golden angles, golden sections, golden triangles, and the Fibonacci series ofnumbers generated from the golden section permeated Egyptian culture formillennia and were a full-fledged priestly obsession for all those thousands ofyears.220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"To a magician’s eye, the ritual purpose is clear: ‘resurrection mathematics’combined with an earthly map of the stars associated with achieving posthumousimmortality, specifically Orion, built into a landscape that is simultaneously a map ofthe afterlife and the actual afterlife.

There are the ruined‘mortuary’ temples at the bases of the three pyramids. There are also hundreds andhundreds of Predynastic, Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom tombs, as well as manymore burials from much later on in Egyptian history, right up until the Classical Age.Given the area’s astounding antiquity and its potent magical ability to ensure one’ssurvival beyond physical death, it is not hard to understand Giza’s enduring appeal asthe necropolis of choice for the discerning Egyptian.The Great PyramidThe Great Pyramid was the tallest structure on earth for over four thousandyears, until the building of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. For most of recorded history itwas known that Khufu was not buried inside it. This is because Herodotus, the ‘fatherof history,’ explicitly told us so in the fifth century BCE:The pharaohs Cheops and Chephren were not buried in the pyramids that beartheir names, but were rather buried elsewhere on the Giza Plateau, in theirvicinity.This is from a man who is often the only source of information for events thathappened in the Classical World in the two centuries prior to his life. As nineteenthcentury Egyptology began to bear out some of his previously dismissed claims aboutNew Kingdom Egypt, we hold out hope that one day this shoe – or Grecian sandal –will also drop.North to south and east to west, the Great Pyramid sits at the cross section ofthe most land above sea level anywhere on earth. Its perfectly flat base covers an areagreater than 6 football pitches and it points north to within 500th of a degree, anarchitectural feat unmatched for millennia.It is composed of more than two million stones, all of different shapes and sizes,some of them over 70 tonnes in weight. Over the course of Khufu’s twenty year reign,workers operating in 12 hour shifts, 365 days a year, would have to quarry, carve and221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"fit one block every two and a half minutes. By comparison, Teotihuacan, builtthousands of years later, is half the size of the Great Pyramid and took 150 years tocomplete. In all of history, there was nothing like it and there has been nothing like itsince.As previously mentioned, it is impossible for this ‘tomb’ to have been completedin Khufu’s lifetime, and the scientific dating suggests it is centuries too early to havelanded in his approximate reign. Nevertheless, and however much this maydisappoint some readers, it shows clear evidence of having been built by humans. Tomy eyes, the tremendous attention to astronomic and geographic detail, as well as theresonant properties discussed below, entirely rule out the ‘pyramid as tomb’ theoryand the earlier dating gives us a more satisfying solve for the lack of evidence for alarge, onsite workers village; a structure built over several centuries needs fewerworkers at any one time, and if they were building at an even earlier date thanexpected then it becomes less likely that such evidence would have survived.Inevitably it is a retired civil engineer, Henri Houdin, and not an Egyptologist,who has perhaps come closest to a satisfactory solve for how the Great Pyramid wasconstructed. In 1999, he encountered the preposterous ramp theory and quicklyrealised it was absurd. Houdin proposed a modified spiral ramp theory that hadmultiple ‘chambers’ on the corners of the Great Pyramid that allowed for some of thevery large stones to be turned. Although not perfect – some of the larger stones wouldstruggle to be turned even with the corner ‘chambers’ – the theory has some hardscientific data to support it. A 1980 thermal image of the Great Pyramid shows somelow density areas that broadly match Houdin’s ‘internal ramp’ layout.Houdin’s theory has some compelling implications for the existence ofadditional rooms or chambers within the Great Pyramid. Firstly, there are the obvious‘corner chambers’ that would have been covered with outer stones. Secondly,according to Houdin’s architect son, Jean-Pierre – who built extensive 3D modelssupporting the theory and expounded it in The Secret of the Great Pyramid – there is asecondary entrance into the King’s Chamber at the opposite end of the wall whichhouses the ‘main’ entrance. For the rest of the chamber, you cannot fit a razor bladebetween the stones. At the western end of the north wall, however, it is possible to fit ‘acredit card’ between one large block and the adjacent blocks, implying this particularstone can freely move. This theoretical hidden chamber would align exactly north, inkeeping with the architectural style of ‘earlier’ pyramids. It may also have provided ameans for getting the sarcophagus into the King’s Chamber, as it is too large to havemade it through the existing entranceway.222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Built by humans though it was, the Great Pyramid remains truly wyrd, and theKing’s Chamber is especially so. In his provocative The Giza Power Plant:Technologies of Ancient Egypt, master craftsmen and aeronautics engineerChristopher Dunn suggests that the structure was a chemical and microwave-basedpower generator at the centre of some ancient national grid. While the hypothesis isentirely lacking in supporting evidence, Dunn nevertheless presents some compellingscientific data that are a better match for an ‘immortality ritual centre’ hypothesis,particularly when the astrotheology and golden angles are taken into account.Principally, these are the obvious harmonic and resonant qualities of the GrandGallery and King’s Chamber. On his website, gizapower.com, Dunn writes:The details of the Grand Gallery are extremely important and have no parallel inany other structure on Earth. Its geometric design predicts that sound originatingwithin its space is focused through a passageway past the Antechamber and intothe granite complex known as the King’s Chamber. This phenomena (sic) hasbeen noted by musicians, acoustical engineers, military scientist and laypeoplealike.The King’s Chamber continues this resonant theme. Firstly, it is effectively free-standing within the larger pyramid structure, with a five inch support gap between itsgranite walls and the surrounding limestone, as well as a floor – which unsurprisingly‘rings’ when you walk on it – built atop a ‘corrugated’ limestone base. Returning toChristopher Dunn, again from his website:The acoustic qualities of the design of the upper chambers of the Great Pyramidhave been referenced and confirmed by numerous visitors since the time ofNapoleon, whose men discharged their pistols at the top of the Grand Galleryand noted that the explosion reverberated into the distance like rolling thunder.Striking the coffer inside the King’s Chamber results in a deep bell-likesound of incredible and eerie beauty, and it has been a practice over the yearsfor the Arab guides to demonstrate this resonating sound to the tourists theyguide through the pyramid. This sound was included on Paul Horn’s album,(Inside The Great Pyramid, Mushroom Record, Inc., L.A., CA) After beingadvised of the significant pitch produced by the coffer when it has been struck,and the response of the chamber to this pitch, Horn brought along a devicewhich would give him the exact pitch and frequency. Horn tuned his flute to thistone which was emitted, which turned out to be ‘A’ 438 cycles per second. In afascinating booklet about his experiences at the Great Pyramid, Horn describesphenomena concerning the acoustic qualities of the inner chambers.223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"‘The moment had arrived. It was time to play my flute. I thought of BenPeitcsh from Santa Rose, California (a man who had told Mr. Horn about thepitch of the coffer) and his suggestions to strike the coffer. I leaned over and hitthe inside with the fleshy part of the side of my fist. A beautiful round tone wasimmediately produced. What a resonance! I remember him also saying whenyou hear that tone you will be ‘poised in history that is ever present.’ I took theelectronic tuning device I had brought along in one hand and struck the cofferagain with the other and there is was - ‘A’ 438, just as Ben predicted. I tuned upto this pitch and was ready to begin. (The album opens with these events so thatyou can hear all of these things for yourselves.)’And, indeed, the sound, which Paul Horn brought to my living room, wasmost fascinating. One can understand why many people develop feelings ofreverence when exposed to this sound, for it has a most soothing effect on thenerves. For this alone, the record was worth the price.‘Sitting on the floor in front of the coffer with the stereo mike in the centreof the room, I began to plan, choosing the alto flute to begin with. The echo waswonderful, about eight seconds. The chamber responded to every note equally. Iwaited for the echo to decay and then played again. Groups of notes wouldsuspend and all come back as a chord. Sometimes certain notes would stick outmore than others. It was always changing. I just listened and responded as if Iwere playing with another musician. I hadn’t prepared anything specific to play. Iwas just opening myself to the moment and improvising. All of the music thatevening was this way -totally improvised. Therefore, it is a true expression ofthe feelings that transpired.’ After noting the eerie qualities of the King’s andQueen’s Chambers, Paul Horn went out onto the Great Step at the top of theGrand Gallery to continue his sound test. The Grand Gallery, he reported,sounded rather flat compared with the other Chambers. He heard somethingremarkable at this time. He heard the music he was playing coming back to himclearly and distinctly from the King’s Chamber. The sound was going out into theGrand Gallery and was being reflected through the passageway andreverberating inside the King’s Chamber!It is likely that the sarcophagus in the King’s Chamber had even more potentresonant effects compared to those that are observed today. According to RobertTemple, up until the middle of the nineteenth century, a small hammer was attached bya rope to the sarcophagus, allowing visiting Victorian tourists to gently strike it andexperience the reverberations. This ended one evening when a disgruntled local brokein and smashed one of its corners, feeling its vibratory effects were decidedly ‘un-224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Muslim.’Above the King’s Chamber are the so-called ‘relief chambers,’ described assuch because their speculative purpose was to relieve the weight of the stones abovethe King’s Chamber. However, they are structurally redundant and only relieve theirown weight, as the cantilever roof of the King’s Chamber does all the actual relieving.These 70 tonne granite slabs must have had another purpose. Given the hundreds ofmiles these slabs travelled from their quarry, granite’s resonant properties and thespaces between each slab, we may speculate these also formed a deliberate part ofthe auditory/magical ritual space.That the dimensions of the Great Pyramid reflect the circumference and polarradius of the earth have been known since Napoleon’s visit, having been firstcalculated by Edme-François Jomard in 1798. Dividing its perimeter by twice itsheight also yields 3.144, remarkably close to π. What looks like redundant complexityin the ‘pointy tomb’ theory makes complete sense in the context of the wider ritualarea: building a microcosm of the earth inside an astronomically aligned, goldennumbered, harmonic, sky/ground map.There is tantalising evidence, discussed below, that the ritual significance of theGiza Plateau – including its planetary dimensions – lasted at least into the NewKingdom in the form of the Book of the Dead, whereupon it just might have influencedthe creation of the Hermetica and the Greek Magical Papyri, and thus the westernmagical tradition. First we must briefly examine the king who gave the structure itscurrent name, Khufu.Leaving aside some misspelled ‘builders’ graffiti’ of dubious origin found in the‘relief chambers,’ there is nothing inside the Great Pyramid that connects it to Khufu.Outside is slightly different. The causeway connecting the Valley Temple to the‘Mortuary Temple’ at the base of the Great Pyramid contains a partial depiction ofKhufu, dressed in his Heb Sed regalia; a potent indicator as to the function of thepyramid during this particular Fourth Dynasty king’s reign. The ‘Mortuary Temple’situated at the base of the pyramid contains a large courtyard which Dr Naydler,probably correctly, believes was the site of Khufu’s Heb Sed ritual. (Based on the insitu evidence of a rope pulley system, Temple believes Khufu is actually interred in asubterranean chamber underneath this courtyard, presenting us with the tantalisingpossibility that his tomb remains intact.) Given the lack of evidence of a posthumousrelationship tying Khufu to the Great Pyramid, and the sole causeway depiction of himin Heb Sed garb, and Herodotus’s assertion he was buried not in but near the pyramid,and the open air courtyard as part of his ‘Mortuary Temple,’ the evidence invites us to225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"assert that this particular king – unquestionably powerful and ruling over an OldKingdom at the peak of its influence – conducted his Heb Sed ritual at a pre-existingsacred site, but did not actually build the area’s most prominent structure. Given thepotency of the magic baked into the Giza Plateau, he cannot be faulted for this bolddecision.Returning to the idea that the Great Pyramid was the preeminent structure in analready profoundly magical landscape, we have hints of its ritual significance showingup in the New Kingdom’s Book of the Dead, universally acknowledged as astorehouse of at least some of the same spells found in the Old Kingdom’s PyramidTexts. In particular, we have references to a ‘secret map of the earth’ at Rostau (Giza).Referring to the Book of the Dead, Temple writes in The Sphinx Mystery:There are some portions of the Book of the Dead material that appear to refer toGiza. But the two most important texts about Giza are two sections of theearliest actual ‘book’ of the underworld, which is now known as The Book of theAm-Duat, or The Book of What Is in the Netherworld. This was not its originaltitle. In the text itself, its original title is given as The Book of the HiddenChamber. [...]The Book of the Hidden Chamber ... commences its description of Gizawith a picture of a descending passage beside which stands the goddess Neithwearing the Crown of the North ... It seems reasonable to assume, therefore,that this picture refers symbolically to a northern entrance. Because the threemain pyramids at Giza all have descending passages with northern entrances,and since the description is meant to be of Giza, it does not seem to bestretching a point to conclude that at least the commencement of the strangeillustrations of ‘the passages of Rostau’ in The Book of the Hidden Chamberbegin with that simplest of things, the entrance to a major pyramid. Presumablythe Great Pyramid was intended.From the Middle Kingdom’s Twelfth Dynasty, we have a spell from The Book ofTwo Ways which makes the ritual continuity even more explicit:I have passed by the roads of Rostau by water and on land; these roads arethose of Osiris; they are in the sky. If a man knows a Spell for going down intothem, he will be like a god directed by the followers of Thoth. He will indeed godown to every heaven to which he desires to descend. But if he knows not thisSpell for passing on these roads, he will fall prey to the tribunal of the dead [...]In the same Middle Kingdom text we read that ‘the secret figure of the earth’ is226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"••••on the surface at Giza, above the hidden chamber of Sokar. This seems fairly goodevidence that not only were the dimensions of the Great Pyramid deliberately builtaround an understanding of our planet’s dimensions, but also that an awareness of thisdeliberate dimensionality passed into the subsequent Middle and New Kingdoms.After five thousand years, we may only speculate as to the form of the ritualsperformed at and within the Great Pyramid, but its astronomical and planetaryalignments, its resonant qualities, its deliberate use of stone, its international interestand its precision mathematics all point to them being of huge significance. We maylook askance at some of the ritual content via the utterances of the Pyramid Texts.Although they arrived later, their shamanic undertones point to their antiquity and somemodified form of them was presumably deployed at Giza. Heading forward in time,we see the fragmentary survival of this ‘stellar immortality magic’ in the texts of theMiddle Kingdom, then the New Kingdom and from there – in an even morefragmentary form – in the Greek Magical Papyri and thus into the western tradition.Khafre and Menkaure’s PyramidsIf the pyramids are tombs, it seems clear that Fourth Dynasty kings did notsuffer from penis envy. Remarkable though these structures are, they are quiteliterally in the shadow of their neighbour and tend to be ignored. From a ritualperspective, a few points are worth noting:Khafre’s pyramid contains a granite sarcophagus with 90° angles so perfect youwould be forgiven for thinking they were machined. They certainly were notconstructed with dolerite pounders. (Menkaure’s was lost at sea, bound forLondon.)Both pyramids have Valley Temples and ‘Mortuary Temples’ with open-aircourts, suggestive of further Heb Sed activity.As Robert Bauval noted in the early 1990s, their comparative size and locationmatches both the brightness and location of Orion’s belt stars.There were several kings between Khufu and Menkaure, so it is almostimpossible to suggest ‘pointy tombs’ were a family affair.The SphinxIt is now commonly known that, thanks to John Anthony West and Dr RobertSchoch, the erosion patterns on the body of the Sphinx and its enclosure have beensubjected to heavy, vertical, water erosion, in addition to the horizontal wind erosion227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"one would expect to find in an area that was desertified by the time of the OldKingdom. This has led some people to conjecture that the entire Giza complex datesback at least 8,000 or 9,000 years; the last time Egypt was subjected to sustained,heavy rainfall; and that the Sphinx itself – which clearly had its head recarved at leastonce – was originally a lion, facing the heliacal rising of Leo on the spring equinox. Aswe have seen, the few pieces of scientific dating performed in the Great Pyramid orthe Osiris Shaft do not bear out the suggestion that the entire site is that old.The necessity to hang so much importance on a single structure has lessenedwith the discovery of Göbekli Tepe; we now have incontrovertible proof that ourPalaeolithic ancestors had a sophisticated megalithic cosmology prior to thedevelopment of towns or agriculture. In a hypothesis where the Giza Plateau is somesort of long-used, Otherworld ‘ritual arena,’ it would not be unexpected to find thatsome of the site’s natural features had been shaped during the Palaeolithic, and thensuccessively reshaped in the subsequent millennia before it was eventually coveredby the desert sands. Indeed, one proposed ‘solve’ for Dr Schoch’s geological evidenceis Robert Temple’s suggestion that the Sphinx’s original shape was a jackal, Anubis,and not a lion, which is a better match for an Otherworld ritual space given theassociation of the jackal and the Dead. Temple’s explanation for the (vertical) waterdamage is that the natural erosive properties of dew working on porous limestone –the geological counter-hypothesis to the ‘ancient rain’ theory – was made worse by theregular dredging of the ‘Sphinx Moat.’ He is probably correct about the existence of themoat, which we will discuss below, but the vertical water erosion looks to the eyes ofhundreds of geologists to be the result of sustained rainfall. I propose the originalSphinx, in whatever form, was originally shaped out of the limestone during a wetterclimatic period, and may even have been surrounded by water during the inundation.We know the Nile Valley was inhabited at this time, and we know thatcontemporaneous rock-shaping and megalithic construction were occurringelsewhere on earth, so the suggestion is not unreasonable. Then, sometime before orduring the site’s ritual use in the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods, the Sphinxwas a jackal, sitting in an artificial lake. The evidence for this?Firstly, as most pet owners will tell you, the body shape and pose is much morecanine than leonine. Once you have had this pointed out to you, it is hard to see it anyother way. Remember that, over the course of Egyptian civilisation, this culture carvedhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jackals and lions. We are not talking aboutthe first day of art school here.Secondly, the Sphinx is barely visible from ground level as it has been carvedinto the bedrock. You will struggle to find other examples of this sort of ‘hiding away’ of228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"monumental objects. It rather defeats the point. (Doubly so if you still believe that theFourth Dynasty kings ‘picked prominent locations’ for their ‘tombs’ so that everyonewho saw them ‘would be in awe of their power.’) There is also the small matter of thenarrow, insalubrious alleyway between the Sphinx Temple and the adjacent ValleyTemple of Khafre. There is no other entrance into the Sphinx enclosure, forcing one topicture high priests and kings squeezing down it and scrambling over what RobertTemple suspects is the remains of a sluice gate. The absence of doorways into whatwe currently call the Sphinx Temple, plus a possible sluice gate, speaks strongly ofthe sort of enclosure you would need to retain the Nile floodwater that we know madeit to the eastern side of the temple during the inundation.Finally, given the very likely situation that the Giza complex and its magico-spiritual purpose survived in some of the spells of the Middle and New Kingdoms, it isstrange that there appears to be no mention of the Sphinx in the Pyramid Texts. Well,there isn’t if you are looking for a king-headed lion, or even just a lion. But if you arelooking for a ‘jackal lake’ or Anubis guarding a city of the Dead, or a giant Anubisbeside a causeway, then you are in luck. Consider Utterance 268.This King washes himself when Ra appears...Horus accepts him beside him,He purifies this King in the Jackal Lake,He cleanses this King’s double in the Lake of the Netherworld.This looks suspiciously like a ritual bathing designed to mirror a nonphysicalpurification, the cleanings of the king’s ‘double’ in the Netherworld. There is more thana little of the Classical Mystery traditions in it.In Utterance 301, when the king addresses Horus, the rising sun, as ‘O greatfloat-user,’ we find:Cleanse the King. Make the King bright in this, your Jackal Lake, O Jackal,In which you cleanse the gods.You have power, you have effectiveness, O Horus, Lord of the Green Stone!Four times – Two green falcons.Again, we are presented with fragmentary glimpses of a wider magical system229"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"•••••••designed to secure immortality through some combination of ground-based starmaps, the stars themselves, the sacred use of stone and the Dead.Magicians familiar with Eliphas Lévi’s Four Powers of the Sphinx are earnestlyencouraged to seek out Robert Temple’s The Sphinx Mystery. I experience amischievous sense of delight at the very real possibility that, from out behind theoverly serious, Neoplatonic silliness of the Four Powers of the Sphinx so beloved ofthe Victorians, whisper the true voices of wisdom, that of the Dead themselves.‘High’ TechnologySuggestions that the Old Kingdom had access to machine tools, electric lighting,microwave energy or any of the other examples of high technology you are likely tosee on cable television, as with any other claim in this book, have an obligation ofproof. And there is none. Nevertheless, a satisfactory solve is required for:The fact that copper tools cannot shape granite at all, let alone to a precision of1/1000th of an inch.The sheer size of some of the stones used in the Old Kingdom, particularly atGiza.The structurally redundant curved corners in the Valley Temples.The use of ‘marshmallow stones,’ such as those found in South America, that fitwith no gaps between them and seem to ‘pillow’ out.The existence of hundreds of perfectly shaped, Early Dynastic vases and bowlsmade of gneiss – one of the hardest stones in existence – or the similarly hardstatues of Old Kingdom rulers utterly devoid of toolmarks.And finally the simple rapidity of the construction projects.Since the Iron Age, and in particular since the Industrial Revolution, westernculture has laboured under a ‘metallic bias.’ Technology means the precisionmanipulation of metals. But the Old Kingdom was the inheritor and ultimate exemplarof a reverence for stone that stretched back thousands of years. Mastery of the earthand heavens was achieved and publicly demonstrated through the manipulation ofstone, not metal. The evidence for this stone ‘technology’ abounds:The resonant quality of the sarcophagus in the King’s Chamber, & the chamberitself.230"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"•••The mildly radioactive quality of the dacite sarcophagus (dating to thePredynastic era), important enough to import the mineral from outside Africa.More extreme levels of radioactivity are found elsewhere on the plateau. IoannisLiritzis, Robert Temple’s co-researcher and a nuclear physicist in his own right,observed that the ‘magazines’ inside Khafre’s Valley Temple are so radioactivethat, ‘any priests working in this temple would certainly have contractedleukaemia within twenty years.’It was access to these ‘magazines’ that required Robert Temple to have the lockbroken on the barred gate as no one had been inside for decades.The optical effects of alabaster and other deliberate combinations of granite,limestone, etc within the temples and pyramids. Khafre’s causeway and ValleyTemple both make extensive use of alternating alabaster and red granite blocks.Temple describes the effect in Egyptian Dawn:Within the Valley Temple, there is a surviving enclosed stairway leading to theroof, which is of course locked and almost never entered by anyone. At first,when I went up and down this stairway I assumed that its walls were oflimestone. But then I became suspicious. I pressed my torch against the walland, sure enough, the stone round the point glowed with a golden light ...[O]riginally this enclosed stairway was a beautiful sparkling white, and if flamingtorches were carried up it, a golden effulgence would have followed the beareron all sides.The alabaster used in the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple does not come fromthe Hawara Quarry. It is made of stalactite that can only have formed insidelimestone caves; caves that one would expect to find under a limestone plateau.The significance of this is often overlooked. As Temple observes, this meansthat during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods, the Egyptians wereenlarging and shaping caverns and removing alabaster from underneath theearth at some scale, as some of the blocks sitting in the Sphinx Temple areseveral tonnes in weight.Just as with the astrotheology of the Pyramid Texts and the resonant qualities ofsome of the chambers of the Great Pyramid, it is impossible to reconstruct exactlywhat symbolic/literal effects the various stone types were intended to achieve. I am ofthe opinion that reconstruction is ahistorical and of limited metaphysical value,anyway. What we can say is the evidence for a specific, megalithic intentionality isincontrovertible. This should not surprise us as the Old Kingdom was the apogee of231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"••••••thousands of years of astro-megalithic experimentation, stretching back to thebeginnings of Laurasia and potentially before. It is our culture’s metallic bias that hasprevented us from considering the mastery of stone to be of the same level oftechnological complexity as the mastery of iron.This same bias has meant the most compelling ‘solve’ for the Old Kingdom’smastery of stone has received little traction outside the Francophone world. Dr JosephDavidovits, a French chemical engineer and world expert in modern and ancientconcrete, suggests that much of the stone used at Giza could have been poured in situ.This sounds unlikely upon first hearing but the precision use of re-agglomerated stoneis attested to from the Roman era, where ‘wet-setting’ cement was used to build theunderwater foundations and abutments for hundreds of bridges, as well as the famousocculus roof of Hadrian’s Pantheon – which required the cement to get lighter andlighter toward the aperture – and is still structurally sound to this day. One wonderswhere the Romans got this technology from in the first place?Davidovits’s process is remarkably simple.Wadis beside the Nile were enlarged by breaking off chunks of the limestonewalls which were then deposited in carved channels in the bases.The flooding of the Nile disaggregated the ‘wall chunks’ piled in these channelsinto clay and lime, forming a mud with all the fossil shells (lime) at the bottom.Natron salt, found in abundance in Egypt, and extra lime from palm ash wasadded to this liquid, forming a caustic soda that suspends the lime within it.More Nile silt, limestone rubble and fossil shells were added, generating aconcrete paste that was carried in baskets and poured into wooden ‘blockenclosures’ onsite.Again, it sounds strange upon first reading but the Romans did something verysimilar and Dr Davidovits points out that our ‘metallic civilisation’ has only beenaware of geopolymer processes since the 1960s. A geopolymer process provides anumber of critical ‘solves’:There is no longer any need for giant ramps and huge workforces to carry near-hundred-tonne blocks. Baskets of concrete poured in situ are faster, and requirea much smaller workforce.The inundation that would flood the wadi quarries would occur just as theagrarian workforce had nothing else to do but wait for the floodwaters to recede232"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"••back from their fields, giving access to a sufficient workforce without puttingfood production at risk.Variants of this geopolymer process likely account for the complete absence oftoolmarks on statues made of stone that approach diamond in their hardness.They could have come from moulds. The same would apply for the remarkablegneiss vases and other curved objects our ‘metallically biased’ culture hasassumed can only be constructed using machines.Being unable to fit even a cigarette paper between separate stones, of wildlydifferent and often frankly bizarre shape, now makes more sense if they werepoured into place and then set.There is some very compelling scientific evidence that Dr Davidovits has comeclosest to working this problem out. Firstly, there are the intrusions – hair, detritus,plant matter – found in many of the limestone blocks, just as one finds in modern dayconcrete. Secondly, and – dare I say – incontrovertibly, is a palaeomagnetic studypublished in volume 43, number 6 (2012) issue of Europhysics News. Quoted on DrDavidovits’s own website, is the introduction to the article:Our paleomagnetic investigation of the two great Egyptian pyramids, Khufu andKhafre, is based on the assumption that if the blocks were made in situ by thegeopolymer concrete technique described above, then their magnetic momentswould all have been parallel, oriented approximately in the north-south direction.However, if the pyramids were constructed from blocks transported from thenearby quarries, having been rotated randomly during transport andconstruction, then the directions of their magnetic moments would be orientedrandomly.A majority of the samples – though not all – did show an alignment of magneticmoments, suggesting that the pyramids were at least partially constructed using thistechnique, in addition to being augmented with nearby natural limestone. These resultsare expected when dealing with a culture that did use specific stones for specificmagical purposes and was willing to import the correct ones, such as Aswan graniteor the dacite sarcophagus inside the Osiris Shaft (from who knows where).In an interview that opens his book, Why the Pharaohs Built the Pyramids withFake Stones, Dr Davidovits remarks:Not only the pyramids but other megaliths from antiquity too often present uswith the same puzzles: quarries that are always several dozen kilometres away,233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"for example, posing huge transport problems; the problems of carving theseenormous blocks of stone in an age when iron is still unknown. The more I thinkabout it, the more absurd I find the idea.Dr Davidovits’s examination of the Rapa Nui geological reports leads him toconclude that the earliest Moai were made using a similar process – recall that thequarries are ‘missing’ – and it was only the later ones that were carved from thevolcanic rock. We are thus left with the compelling possibility that the ‘Laurasianfootprint’ covers both mythology and technology. In his essay on Davidovits, ‘ThePyramid Heretic,’ the late, lamented Phil Coppens had this to say:Davidovits is also convinced that the method of stone making was at the originof alchemy. The deity specifically linked with Khufu was Khnum, which means‘to bind,’ ‘to join,’ ‘to cement,’ ‘to unite’ and which typifies the process ofgeopolymerisation.Egypt was seen as the birthplace of alchemy, but for Davidovits, it is alsothe cradle of chemistry. He argues that certain names, such as mafkat, whichEgyptologists have been unable to translate or explain, are very much ‘inventedwords’ – i.e. technical terms – as they described compounds that ancientchemists had constructed. It is therefore not ‘white powder gold,’ as authors likeLaurence Gardner have argued.Davidovits argues that when Imhotep is credited as ‘the inventor of the artof constructing with cut stones,’ it is actually a mistranslation of the Greekxeston lithon, which does not translate as ‘cut stone,’ but rather means ‘theaction to polish stone.’ For Davidovits, Imhotep is actually the inventor ofworking with agglomerates, or geopolymers.It may be overstating it somewhat to call geopolymerisation the ‘origin’ ofalchemy. Since their translation more than a century ago, it has not escaped the noticeof esotericists that there is a distinctly alchemical idiom to the Pyramid Texts withtheir reference to stones, metals and distinct processes of magical transformation. Ifgeopolymersation was used in the Old Kingdom’s grand, astrotheological buildingproject it certainly becomes a part of the legend that grew over the millennia into whatwe now call alchemy.From earlier cultures, Egypt inherited much of its star lore as well as thesanctity of stone. The innovations she brought to these beliefs were dramaticallyimproved forms of masonry and a calendrical and mathematical sophistication thatwent unequalled for thousands of years. The magical efficacy of these developments,234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"their consciousness effects, will be explored in later chapters. We may speculate herethat entangling one’s consciousness with certain stars led to certain‘inspirations/innovations,’ which improved the technology of consciousnessentanglement, which led to further ‘inspirations/innovations.’Think of it like a cosmic version of runaway climate change.EXPLICIT ASTROTHEOLOGYThere are a few pieces of explicit astrotheology that potentially tie together thepyramids, the magical formula for stellar immortality and suggest a revised timedepth for their first development. Robert Bauval notes that at least three of thepyramids are named after kings-as-stars: Djedefre is a Star in the Sky, Nebka is aStar and in the case of the Step Pyramid, Horus is the Star at the Head of the Sky.When a 12th dynasty pyramidion was discovered in 1900, the head of the EgyptianAntiquities Organisation described its black granite surface as being ‘polished like amirror.’ Its eastern face addresses Horakhti, its southern addresses Anubis, itswestern addresses Osiris-Sokar-Ptah and the northern addresses Sah-Orion. Amirror reflecting the night sky built atop a stone map of the night sky in a country thatesotericists know as ‘the mirror of heaven.’Given the broad consensus that pyramids are typologically similar to obelisks inAncient Egypt, Bauval then examines the symbolism of the benben – the tip of theobelisk – in the context of pyramidions. Obelisks are transparently phallic symbols,and ‘benben’ is very similar to the Ancient Egyptian word for semen. Geb is regularlydepicted with an erect phallus, inseminating the star goddess, Nuit, the mother ofOsiris.The magical formula that suggests itself then, is the insemination of the nightsky so that the king or operant can be born as an imperishable star, perhaps thecommonest refrain of the Pyramid Texts.

For such a critical figure in early Egyptian cosmology, there arecomparatively few temples to Nuit. One possible reason for this is she is ‘too far up’the creation story and is thus more of a ‘universal force’ than a goddess. There isprobably something to this analysis but it is an insufficient explanation on its own.Firstly, she is actively involved in the Pyramid Text formula and there are other divineforces, such as Maat, that had temples.Further evidence of her antiquity comes from an examination of her role as onepart of the ‘separation of earth and sky parents’ motif. At first glance, the genderreversal of the pairing – having a female sky and male earth – appears to be an outlierin the motif; ‘earth mothers’ and ‘sky fathers’ are seemingly more common. Dr Witzelaccounts for the variation below:The reversed position may be further elucidated by a comparison with Vedicmyth. In daytime, the sky arches over the earth, like Father Heaven, stemmedup by Indra from the prostrate Mother Earth. But at night, the situation isreversed: Earth and the primordial hill or rock, on which she rests, have turnedupside down and overarch the now prostrate Heaven as the ‘stone sky’ ofIranian, Hawai’ian and Pueblo myth.Such an interpretation would explain not only the extremely common depictionof Nuit inside coffins but also the numerous instances of Tefnut, a Mother Earthanalogue, painted on the inside of sarcophagi. The deceased is in theUnderworld/stars, thus the earth is now his or her sky. Tefnut, in addition to herconsort, Shu, are the conjoined couple ‘the next level up’ from Geb and Nuit,237"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"suggesting a ‘passing back up through the worlds’ for the deceased. Recall also thatthe ritual timings of the Pyramid Texts and royal mummification rituals rely onasterisms such as Orion and Sirius to rise above the horizon, to ‘emerge’ from theUnderworld/sky, from their Mother, Nuit. The Dead are under the earth and also in thestars.Stone age carvings from Laussel show the same sexual arrangement, with awoman atop and arching over a bearded, prostrate man. From Laussel we also havethe more famous sculpture of the ‘goddess’ holding the moon. It appears that theMother of Osiris, like her son, was supremely old by the time she made it to Egypt. Ifshe was not always too old for even the very idea of temples, they would have beenelsewhere, and have long since turned to dust or been lost to the waves.In Egypt’s Old Kingdom we thus see the most perfect expression of a supremelyancient idea. The spirits – and by extension, humanity – come from, return to and arethe stars.238"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"IXAll things fear Time, but Time fears the Pyramids. IbnFadlallah al-‘UmariTHE TREE OF MANYBRANCHESMoving into the historical period, several of the most important vectors ofClassical Age thinking and practice, and how they relate to the western magicaltradition, have been diligently presented. For such information, I commend to you thework of Jake Stratton-Kent, Owen Davies, Stephen Skinner, Peter Grey and RonaldHutton.The possibility of survivals through folklore, especially survivals dating back tothe Palaeolithic, has been comparatively underexplored. Dr Witzel refers to suchsurvivals as ‘grandmother stories’ as opposed to ‘grandfather stories’; which would bethe continuity of official narratives. One example he offers is the Cental European‘nursery story’ of the stork delivering a newborn baby from the ‘lake of Heaven.’ Heconsiders this a survival of the Gondwana motif of the ‘well of souls,’ meaning it hasbeen with us for up to 50,000 years.Western magic veers between considering itself either a ‘grandmother’ survivalor a ‘grandfather’ survival. Certainly, the continuity of the grimoire tradition owes moreto Middle Class/grandfather influences, simply by virtue of the cost of printing and thespread of literacy. However, grandmother survivals – almost by definition – are lesslikely to appear in the historical record and thus suffer from an ‘absence of evidence’problem. Viewed in aggregate over the last two thousand years, it would be hard toargue against the suggestion that, by volume, the majority of magical survivals havebeen grandmother ones, from simple fortune-telling with roasting chestnuts to tyingrags onto trees beside wells. Returning to Wendy Doniger’s The Implied Spider:The chameleon quality of myth works in opposition to the more monolithic anddogmatic aspects of religion; where myth encourages a wide range of beliefs,dogma would narrow that range. Martin Buber made this point very well indeed:All positive religion rests on an enormous simplification of the manifold andwildly engulfing forces that invade us: it is the subduing of the fullness of239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"existence. All myth, in contrast, is the expression of the fullness of existence, itsimage, its sign; it drinks incessantly from the gushing fountains of life. Hence,religion fights myth where it cannot absorb and incorporate it ... It is strange andwonderful to observe how in this battle religion ever again wins the apparentvictory, myth ever again wins the real one.What Buber says about religion, I would limit to dogma. With thatcorrective, I think Buber’s statement a marvellous testimony to myth’s ability tokeep open the doors of imagination within the most constricting dogmaticframeworks. It has been said that a language is a dialect with an army. I wouldsay that dogma is a myth with an army.Even with the measurability challenge inherent in ‘grandmother stories,’ nowthat we are in the historical period we may discern a brilliant whorl of mutating motifstumbling through time – propelled by unseen motivations – toward us. Much estimableand convincing work has been done in the past decade to demonstrate the continuity ofwestern magic’s form and function from the Late Classical World into Europe’sgrimoire tradition. In Techniques of Solomonic Magic, a book based on his PhD thesison that very subject, Stephen Skinner observes:It is important to realise that the key nomina magia used in the [Greek MagicalPapyri] like Sabaoth, IAO endure from the PGM right through to the 20th centurygrimoires. Although some of the primarily Egyptian nomina magia likeBainchōōōch were dropped, the bulk of those taken from Jews in Alexandriasurvived. The methods such as threatening one spiritual creature with another,or using a phylactery or lamen or floor circle for protection also endured. Veryfew new methods were introduced although the exact wording of theconjurations changed over time.Given the strong Egyptian influences on the admittedly-polyglot Greek MagicalPapyri, it is interesting to me that we see the same ‘bullying one spirit with another’behaviour in the Pyramid Texts, right at the very beginning of Dynastic Egypt,thousands of years before the creation of the PGM. (And close enough in time toNeolithic shamanism to spy its actual origins on the plains of Africa and Eurasia.)Whether there was a continuous, mouth-to-ear continuity between the pyramidcomplexes of the Old Kingdom and the era of the PGM may well be irrelevant in justthe same way the mouth-to-ear continuity of practice between the PGM and us isirrelevant. Skinner again:[I]n Europe ... unrelenting Christian persecution of magic has been in force for atleast 1,650 years, and before that, selective Roman persecution (but mainly in240"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"cases where magic overlapped with treason). Although it is sometimes possibleto identify some of the magicians who owned a specific magician’s handbook, itis not often possible to identify the passage of techniques and training from onemagician to another. The history of magic in Europe therefore has more oftenbeen one of rediscovery, each magician reassembling techniques from thebooks and manuscripts of previous practitioners, rather than direct oral tradition.Under these circumstances it is remarkable that there is such a degree ofcommonality.Remarkable though the continuity of ritual is for the practising magician, there isalso some continuity of characters. In Geosophia, Jake Stratton-Kent provides solidevidence for the survival of specific spirits into the grimoire tradition that go back asfar as Classical times, to Archaic Greece and to points beyond. If we can pin certainspirits that still appear in our grimoires to Archaic Greece – admittedly a long timeago – then that brings them into alignment with the motifs and asterisms we have sofar explored in this book, instantly adding a few dozen millennia to their true antiquity.For example, we know Astaroth derives from Astarte. And Astarte from Ishtar. AndIshtar from Inanna. Typically we stop there, but how old do you think Inanna is afterreading the Eurasian chapter?EGYPTEgypt’s reputation as the home of magic is as old as the country itself. Evenduring the Dynastic Era – and throughout the Greek and Roman periods – Egypt wasthe undisputed originator and master of the magical arts. Historians of western magictypically begin their story with Alexandria. Whilst, as we have seen, it is definitely notthe beginning of the story, Alexandria is certainly a crucial pivot point.The Rise and Fall of AlexandriaA young city by Egyptian standards, Alexandria was founded in 331 BCE byAlexander the Great. The dynasty he installed, the Ptolemies, filled the city’s librarieswith books from across the Classical world. Skinner notes that it was in Alexandriathat the Old Testament was translated into Greek for the first time. What would cometo be known of as the Corpus Hermeticum was composed there and then. Mid-twentieth century historian, Bruno H. Stricker believed the Hermetica got its start withan order from Ptolemy I to write down all the priestly wisdom of Egypt. The GreekMagical Papyri – although the documents themselves are Theban – typify the dizzyinghybridity of Egyptian spirituality admixed with Jewish, Greek and Mesopotamianthought.241"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Over the centuries, this admixture has led scholars to declare wildly variantamounts of ‘Egyptianness’ in the western magical tradition. Prior to the translation ofhieroglyphics in the nineteenth century, ‘Egyptianness’ was probably overemphasised.Today, it is likely to be underemphasised. As an example, the prominence of astrologyin Alexandrian magic has been attributed to Greek and Near Eastern influence. Whilstthis is probably the case for planetary astrology, I argue in the previous chapter that thedecans and prominence of specific asterisms is not only Egyptian, but was present atthe very beginning of Egypt. Much of the confusion lies in the fact that variants of thedecans and asterisms are also found in the Near East. But this merely argues for anearlier date for their first usage; one old enough to have influenced both cultures beforethey coalesced once more at the mouth of the Nile thousands of years later.When examining the western magical diaspora, it is important to realise thatAlexandria fell several times and the final two times triggered major departures thatwould go on to combine and recombine over the next thousand years as magical ideasbounced around the Mediterranean like billiard balls. The first of these falls – RomanAlexandria to the Christian Greeks – in 415 CE saw an influx of hermetic ideas backinto the Near East and most notably, to the city of Harran, only a few miles fromGöbekli Tepe. Gary Lachman describes this vector in The Quest for HermesTrismegistus:From its origins in Ptolemaic Alexandria to its rediscovery in RenaissanceFlorence, the Corpus Hermeticum was secretly shuttled across medievalEgypt, Turkey, and the Middle East. Fleeing the ravages of religious intoleranceand wars of conquest, it travelled from Alexandria to the mysterious city ofHarran, where it became the prophetic book of a strange community ofHermeticists. From Harran it reached Baghdad, where, in the midst of Islam, itinformed the mystical philosophy of the Sufis. And when Islamicfundamentalism came to power, it abandoned Baghdad to find a haven in aConstantinople that would itself soon fall to the Turk.We will return to Harran later in the chapter and attempt, like Shu separatingGeb and Nuit, to split apart the grandmother and grandfather survivals found in theNear East.The second significant diaspora happened following the fall of ChristianAlexandria to Islam in 636 CE, triggering an exodus of Neoplatonists and magicians toConstantinople, under the patronage of Emperor Heraclitus, who sought to revive theglories of the Classical Age. According to Stephen Skinner, it is from Constantinoplethat the earliest grimoires, those with the clearest Egyptian antecedents, entered242"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Europe, probably by way of Venice.Grandmother EgyptEgypt’s new masters had a more sophisticated relationship with the magic theyinherited than is commonly believed. We see the influence of Alexandrian magic in thelibraries of Moorish Spain, an under-examined vector of the Western magicaltradition. (Oxford’s first library owed much to the books of Moorish Spain, as does theentire troubadour/grail tradition.)Whilst the practice of ritual magic – the grandfather line – was certainly frownedupon in Muslim Egypt, it seems pretty clear that a high volume of detail about themagic of Dynastic Egypt survived in a folkloric, grandmother capacity. From thebeginning of the Arab period, there was a clear association between the pyramids andthe stars. More specifically between Hermes Trismegistus, that apocryphalstorehouse of Egyptian stellar wisdom; the pyramids; and the belief that they were insome sense ‘stone wisdom texts’ from before the Flood. The Islamic invadersinherited Alexandria’s ‘astral folk religion’ which bled through into subsequentcenturies. This indicates a grandmother transfer among the non-literate classes inEgypt at the time, as there are clear continuities from the Roman and Greek periodsinto the Arab period.During the Roman era, Khufu was described as having written an alchemicalwork and that his pyramid was connected with alchemy. Zosimus (approx. 300 CE)writes that the alchemical process is also known as ‘Osirification.’ The Apocryphon ofJohn retains the Egyptian idea that the decans influence different parts of the humanbody. The correspondence of the human form to specific asterisms is a clearcontinuity of the kind of immortality magic found in the Old Kingdom and is retained asthe hermetic notion of the microcosm corresponding to the macrocosm. Theassociation between one’s fate and the stars, as well as the methods of overcoming itusing explicitly astral magic, were regarded as Egyptian in origin and survived into theArab era. We see a development of prayers to Jesus to remove the bonds of fate as acontinuity of some of the PGM spells, such as those to Sarapis in The Eighth Book ofMoses. Sarapis is entreated to wipe out an unlucky natal chart/astral fate and replaceit with a beneficial one. The magician would ascend through various planetary planes– those which inflict fate upon mankind – to the realm of the fixed stars, the OldKingdom home of ‘true immortality.’By the 900s at the latest, the Arabic tradition considered alchemy to be ‘thescience of the temples’ (‘ilm al-barabi) and it was in the temples of Egypt that the243"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"secrets of this science, as inscribed by Hermes, were to be found. There were in factat least three Hermes at this time. According to Zosimus, whose books made it intothe famous Kitab al-Fihrist, the first lived before the Flood and he, along with thepriests of Egypt, carved his wisdom on the walls of these temples using symbolicsigns.The Sabians, those of the Harran exodus, retain yet more explicit associations:Hermes built the pyramids of Egypt before the Flood as a way to transmit and keepsafe the sacred mathematical, magical, medicinal and astronomical knowledge of theancients. In some texts, the pyramids of Khufu and Khafre are the tombs of HermesTrismegistus and Agathodaimon. Writing in the 13th century and relying on Sabiansource material, Al-Halabi suggested that the pyramids were built by a pre-Adamicrace of beings, probably making him the world’s first Ancient Aliens theorist.It is worth remembering that the ability to read hieroglyphs had been lost by thebeginning of the Arab period. Jan Assmann makes an observation about theunderstanding of time in non-literate cultures that would apply to semi-literate onesalso. There is ‘historical time’ which is comprised of events in recent tribal or culturalmemory. Before this there is ‘mythological time’ which is a great storehouse ofeverything else that has happened, more likely arranged by event rather thansequentially. Thus, the Sabians did not retain a direct memory of the end of the IceAge. However, there are aspects of their culture that were inherited from far earliertimes, and the memory of that inheritance is signified by the presence of the Flood. Itis a binary, before/after event in ‘mythological time.’ Failing to recognise thesedifferences has led academics to dismiss any possible transmission wholesale. It hasalso foundered many an Atlantologist’s ship on the rocks of literalism.EgyptosophyPrior to the decipherment of hieroglyphs by Champollion in 1822, Europe’sunderstanding of Egypt was parsed through this mythic interpretation of its templesand mysteries. Erik Hornung, Emeritus Professor of Egyptology at the University ofBasel, distinguishes this ‘Egyptosophy’ from the later discipline of Egyptology.Each era of European history has had its Egyptosophy. Marsilio Ficino’sPlatonic Academy in fifteenth century Florence saw Egypt through the eyes of theClassical hermeticists. His Egypt bears little relation to the Dynastic era. It was aplace of high wisdom, above the petty squabbles of kings, popes and bankers.Hornung writes in The Secret Lore of Egypt: Its Impact on the West:The founder of this Hermetic religion, whom even Christianity and Islam244"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"venerated as a predecessor of their own prophets, became an integrating figureduring the early modern period, a bearer of hope and patron of a body ofknowledge independent of the Bible and the Quran. Even Copernicus couldappeal to him in founding a new system ...The Egypt of Ficino and Bruno electrified European intellectual life. As theReformation and Counter Reformation unfolded, the notion of a peaceable, inclusivephilosophy held greater and greater appeal. The Rosicrucians, ironically just beforethe Thirty Years’ War, anticipated the renewal of the world via the return of hermeticphilosophy.In later centuries, Egypt exemplified the perfect political model of theEnlightenment: just laws, peace and a cultural Renaissance. French Revolutionaries,Freemasons, everyone saw in an Egyptosophical Egypt a vision of their preferredworld: either it was the template for how to live under a benign monarch or it was anexample of what happens to the common man when all those dastardly kings andpriests are allowed to run the show. That vision of cruelty to the Egyptian workforce atthe hands of an evil priesthood – which was used at the time as a metaphor forCatholicism – survived into twentieth century Egyptology.Catholicism itself vigorously adopted many hermetic trappings in an attempt toalign with that ‘purer, original’ source, as evidenced by the layout and iconography ofmany Renaissance churches, as well as the face-meltingly obvious hermetic suntemple design of St Peter’s itself. With the return to England of Charles II and thefoundation of the Royal Society, wizards to a man, people such as Christopher Wrenwere keen to use hermetic principles to rebuild London as a ‘New Jerusalem.’There is something delightful in the infinite recursion of Egypt – the source ofhermetic symbolic magic for all these men – being itself a symbol for each of theirperfect world. (Mirror of heaven indeed!) Just as we have the persistence of a ritualform throughout the grimoire period discovered anew, as Skinner notes, with eachgeneration, we similarly have a persistence of architecture as ritual from Saqqara toParis to London to Washington DC, discovered anew by each culture.Delightful though the recursion is, Egyptosophy is not Egyptology and with therise of scientific materialist ‘Hunger Games academia’ in the twentieth century, thetwo are divided by a Nile of vitriol. Hornung regrets this:[I]t would be productive for both sides if there were more bridges and lessreluctance between the scholarly disciplines and esoteric pursuits. We needthink only of the psychological insights won by Carl Gustav Jung from his study245"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"of alchemy, and I regret only that he did not have better sources on ancient Egyptat his disposal. In esoteric circles, people are too dependent on the old, outdatedworks of Budge and ought to take into account more recent literature, which hasmuch to offer of esoteric interest.Dr Naydler would agree, and goes further:The interpretation of religion requires not simply a breadth of knowledge of theculture in which that religion flourished ... but also a feeling for, and a personalinterest in, the nature of religious experience. Religion – even a so-called deadreligion (as ancient Egyptian religion may seem) – is not so much anotheracademic subject to be covered as a universe of human experience to beencountered, engaged with, and affected by ... [T]he deeper understandingarises only when the academic is prepared to allow him- or herself to beexistentially challenged by the material that is being studied.Dr Naydler is certainly correct in this observation. Sadly, that has not been thestory of Egyptology’s inexorable rise. From the mid-nineteenth century, peaking in thelate twentieth century, Egyptology fell into alignment with the materialist, Darwinisticnotions of ‘progression’ from inferior states or cultures to superior ones. This hasmeant that most of the spiritual material has been translated by ‘scholars’ who do notbelieve in the existence of the subject they are studying. It is as if primatologistsrefused to consider the possible existence of gorillas. Naydler describes the impact ofEgyptology’s handmaidening of materialism.The trajectory of history was seen as a steady ascent from the primitivechildhood of humanity, dominated by magic and superstition, to our presentenlightened maturity, characterized by scientific rationalism ... Egyptologybecame handmaiden to a much bigger project – that of materialistic science –which was to explain both the outer and inner worlds in terms that excluded allreference to the spiritual as a real and operative dimension of existence.This denial of any form of indigenous mysticism in Egypt led to the pervasiveacademic belief that the culture was death-obsessed, a conclusion that is notmentioned even once by ancient writers such as Herodotus, who all praised herwisdom and mystic insight. Leaving the interpretation of Egyptian religion in the handsof scientific handmaidens who do not acknowledge the reality of the subject of theirexpertise is the principal cause for the persistence of the notion that the pyramidswere pointy tombs. To their ‘expert’ eyes, Egyptian cosmology was primitive andhaphazard and the Egyptian mind was ‘prephilosophical.’ Talk about glass houses!246"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Denying the Egyptians a form of mysticism led inexorably to the bizarreconclusion that the Egyptians were a practical, materialistic people, caring little for‘The Big Questions’ and with no understanding of or interest in any of the laws offorces which governed the universe. Honestly, the mind boggles.Nevertheless, this was the milieu in which the Victorian magical revivaloccurred. On the one hand you had a persistent eighteenth century fantasism andLondon’s ‘mummy-mania.’ On the other you had materialist savages who were toostupid to invent the wheel. Coherence of opinion was in short supply.NEAR EASTThe mythology of the Near East is a western magical vector in urgent need ofre-examination. Many of occultism’s ‘self-evident truths’ were formed at a time whenthe Hebrew Bible was believed to be an accurate source of history. This presents anynumber of challenges. We do not know the date of the original composition of most ofits books, nor do we know its authors. There is no historical evidence for largekingdoms under David or Solomon, nor the presence of a large Jewish slave force inEgypt and its subsequent Exodus. Successive translations into Hebrew, Latin andEnglish have obfuscated the hybridity of much of Jewish folklore. Ugaritic gods, mythsand practices found their way into Hebrew cosmology, Yahweh appears to have had awife (Asherah) and most of Judaism’s plot points – Creation, Eden, the Fall, Noah, theaforementioned ‘Golden Age’ kingdoms – have antecedents going as far back asSumeria; an entirely expected outcome for a Laurasian belief system.Of course, a satisfactory reexamination would not just take entire books, butentire lifetimes to complete. A noble first step in this direction is Peter Grey’s Lucifer:Princeps, which provides sufficient context for the magical practitioner to beginincorporating these insights into his or her work. Here we need only answer thefollowing question and address its implications: if Sumerian mythology appears inbiblical mythology, does Neolithic mythology appear in Sumerian?The YezidisWe return to the Cult of the Angels which closed out the Göbekli Tepe chapter.You will recall that the bird/totem motif appears to originate in the Palaeolithic. Wemust be careful with what conclusions we draw from this. In Crowley’s day, it wasbelieved that the Yezidis were a Sumerian survival, and that their principal deity wasthe Devil himself in the form of a fallen angel. Both assertions have long beenabandoned as erroneous. Survivals, in The Lost World sense of the term, are so rareas to be practically non-existent; continuities are a different matter. They may even247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"•••••turn out to be the norm rather than the exception.Yezidism could almost form the template belief system for the Eurasian variantof the Laurasian cosmology. It now encompasses several sects showing greater orlesser Islamic influence over the centuries, but the term itself derives from theKurdish and means ‘the angelicans.’ In terms of the motifs we are now familiar with:It has a distant creator god, followed by seven ‘Ages’ or ‘Emanations’ as part ofthe ongoing act of Creation.The universe was built from either a pearl or an egg, out of which the Creatoremerged.Birds feature prominently, and in some variants the Creation Pearl was placedon the back of a bird for forty thousand years.The universe is presided over by seven ‘good’ angels and seven ‘bad’ angels,demonstrating the influence of planetary cosmology. This number seven alignswith the seven ages of creation.‘God’ is closer to a ‘universal spirit’ and there is a belief in the transmigration ofsouls, rapid reincarnation and then – at the end of the universe – the ‘complete’humans rejoin this universal spirit.It is Yezidism’s propensity for absorption that makes it so worthy of study. Onemajor festival, Jam, occurs at the same time of year as the ancient Eurasian feast ofMithrâkân and appears to be contain continuous motifs from the earlier Mithraicfestival. In The Kurds Mehrdad Izady writes:Ancient Mithrâkân celebrated the act of world creation by the sun god Mithras,who killing the bull of heaven, used its dismembered body to create the materialworld. On the occasion of the feast at Lâlish, riding men pretend to capture abull, with which they then circumambulate the Lâlish shrine of Shams al-Din(the ‘Sun of the Faith’), before sacrificing the bull and distributing its flesh to thepilgrims.We are now in a position to pull some of these motifs further back in time thanMithraism. The bull of heaven’s presence as well as the dismemberment of its corpsespeaks to a much earlier layer, and would bring it into alignment – back throughAssyria, Babylon and Sumeria – with the bull motifs and horns found at Nevali Çori.Malak Tâwus, the Peacock Angel himself, also contains much earlier motifs. It248"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"is Malak Tâwus, or Lucifer, who creates the material world with the dismemberedpieces of the original cosmic egg. Called Azâzil in some tellings, he is depicted as asculpted bronze bird, often on a pole. We have already seen that the bird ‘totem pole’occurs at both Nevali Çori and Göbekli Tepe, but it is the peacock component thatrequires further analysis.Firstly, the peacock is a South Asian bird. Secondly, the Dravidic components ofVedic mythology, as we saw in chapter 7, have Karttikeya descend from heaven ridinga peacock, with the ‘eyes’ in its plumage representing the Pleiades. In his form ofMurugan, he ‘precedes’ the other gods just as the constellation Pleiades precedesOrion, Taurus and the rest of the stars – and just as Malak Tâwus is the first of allseven angels – the rest come after him.Once again, we find ourselves in the same Pleiades/Taurus/Orion corner of thesky, sharing the same motifs. None of these are conscious survivals, but rathercontinuities stretching back significantly further than it appears on first glance. Yezidicosmology is a storehouse for the ‘blended spirit model’ of angels, Nephilim, etc. thattumble down from the plains of Eurasia – moving gods and legends up down andaround with each new worldview – and also proof of concept that such a process cancarry spirits and practices right through from the Palaeolithic, particularly in marginal,‘grand-motherly’ fashions.Return to the Star TempleCombing through the Bible for muddled Kabbalistic insight will only yield somuch magical utility. Treating the Apocrypha as some sort of ‘suppressed’ or ‘hidden’wisdom – standing opposed to the ‘orthodox elite’ narrative – will yield even less.Instead, what is needed is a realisation that certain groups will prioritise certainstories and motifs for localised, contemporaneous political reasons. To yieldmaximum insight and utility, the mythology of the Near East must be viewed as anholistic spectrum. Adopting this approach makes it infinitely easier to see the bleed-through from earlier mythological layers and it is these layers that enable us tocalibrate potential continuities.We explored the possibility that the first emergence of large-scale agriculture inthe Near East at or around Göbekli Tepe may have survived as a motif in the Cattleand Grain Text (as may have the practice of burying temples when they ceased tofunction magically/astronomically). It now appears almost certain that some of thoseSumerian motifs survived into later Babylonian and then Hebrew mythology. Again,the notion of continuity rather than survival presents itself: by the time of Sumeria,Göbekli Tepe had been lost to memory for thousands of years. Nevertheless, if the site249"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"was the preeminent temple in the area where the local cultures first began to learn‘civilisational’ skills, then we might expect its impact to be discerned in cosmology:the stone has sunk to the bottom of the creek, but the ripples expand on the surface.An examination of the many variants of the ‘Shemhazai and Azazel’ story, bestknown from the Book of Enoch, is particularly useful. Shemhazai and Azazel areknown variously as Watchers; Sons of God; angels; giants/Nephilim or the fathers ofNephilim, having produced them by laying with the daughters of man. This assignsthem to that permanently liminal category of leftover gods, ancestors and ‘other’ spiritbeings, where we would expect to find them if they are vectors of earlier motifs. Thecommon parts of the Shemhazai and Azazel story involve their descent from heaven,usually with God’s permission or as a result of a bet with the Creator; their – typicallysexual – interaction with mankind; some sort of instructional role; and then at least oneof the two disobeys God’s rules or directives to return to heaven.The astronomical components of the best-known version are particularlycompelling. Echoing Babylonian mythology, the generation after the Flood begins to goastray once again and God wonders aloud whether he should have ever createdhumans in the first place. Shemhazai and Azazel remind him that they were againstthe idea from the start. Demonstrating the emotional instability that Yahweh is famousfor, after initially despairing of mankind, he suddenly leaps to our defence, saying thatwhile they dwell on earth, they are subject to the ‘Evil Inclination’ which wouldoverpower even Shemhazai and Azazel. The ‘Evil Inclination’ is likely inspired at leastin part by the planetary astrological concept of Fate that can only be overcome byascending above the planetary spheres; everything below these spheres is subject toits inevitable mechanics. (We see this inevitability blended with the decans by thetime of the Greek Magical Papyri.) Shemhazai and Azazel descend to prove that theycan still ‘sanctify the Name’ of God whilst on earth and subject to the Evil Inclination.Predictably, an angelic version of Spring Break unfolds, with the two angelslaying with the daughters of man (and the sons of man, and the pets of man), feastingon flesh, drinking and spilling all the divine secrets of metallurgy, astrology, medicineand so on. Shemhazai and Azazel then decide to select brides; Azazel choosesNa’amah of Tubal-Cain and Shemhazai chooses Istahar, ‘the last of the virgins.’Istahar – very obviously a continuity of the Mesopotamian Ishtar – refuses, and usesher refusal to trick the secret name of God out of Shemhazai. Isis acquires her magicusing similar methods, which may speak to a much earlier origin for this motif(perhaps even Gondwanan, given it is a classic Trickster move). Using the power ofthe name, Istahar ascends into the sky and becomes its brightest star. WhenShemhazai saw Istahar had outwitted him, he recognised it as God’s rebuke for his250"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"sins, and hung himself upside down between heaven and earth.In this telling, the ‘brightest star in the sky’ is actually the planet Venus, which iswhat Istahar becomes. Again there is a parallel with Ishtar/Inanna here. However, asobserved by Howard Schwartz in his excellent Tree of Souls: The Mythology ofJudaism, ‘later’ tellings have Istahar become the Pleiades. In both cases, Shemhazaiis Orion. Once again we thus have the hunter pursuing his female prey across the sky.This may be a late Grecian influence, but it also may not be, given that the identicalmotif is found in Australia at a much earlier period.There are additional elements to this collection of stories that suggest it may‘echo’ or ‘encode’ the development of agriculture at or around Göbekli Tepe. In oneversion, at God’s direction, one of the angels switched to a vegetarian diet while theother refused to give up feasting on flesh, which looks suspiciously like a mythologicaltelling of the coming of agriculture (and its enforcement by the emerging tribal politicalclass). There is also the fact that, most of the time, there are two angels, just as thereare two of Dr Schmidt’s ‘heavenly beings’ formed by the T-pillars in the centre of anastrological temple on the hill. The hunting/Orion/flesh eating component remains, asdoes the prominence of that same Pleiades/Orion/Taurus/Sirius corner of the sky. Andif Belmonte is correct that it was built to mark the appearance of Sirius as a‘companion star’ in the sky to the Hunter, then we also have the ‘bride-seeking’ motifas well. Finally, Göbekli Tepe was the site of beer drinking, flesh eating and, it isreasonably surmised, intertribal wife trading, a practice which continues today duringregular religious festivals at sites shared by hunter gatherer groups. Whenconsidering these alignments, recall that it would have been in the shadow of theseheavenly beings that many of those tribes would have first learned about cultivatingwild grasses, first for beer and then for bread, and subsequently taken this informationwith them.The Sabians and HarranOf Harran, the fourth century historian, Libanius, writes:In Harran there was in the middle of the city a splendid temple considered bymany to be equal of the Serapaeum in Alexandria. On this temple was a towerwhich was used as a military post and watchtower, since from its top one couldoverlook the entire plain of Harran. There were also powerful images in thistemple. But when the praetorian prefect Cynegus ordered the pagan temples inEgypt and Syria to close, at which time most were destroyed, this temple inHarran was partially destroyed, and the idols which were in it also were taken251"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"away and in part destroyed.It seems vanishingly unlikely that the Alexandrian refugees that became theSabians selected Harran because of its proximity to Göbekli Tepe. At this point inhistory, the site had been buried and forgotten for many thousands of years. Harran,like Göbekli Tepe before it, was a trading centre – it even derives its name from theAkkadian for ‘crossroads’ – and, like most trading centres, presumably promisedtolerance and access to new ideas from the east and the west. Nevertheless, thiscoincidence is so unlikely it demands some explanatory model, which may beforthcoming in the next chapter. But first, we need to coincide some more.Mas’udi, writing during his visit to Harran in 943 CE, gives us the only Muslimeyewitness account of the city itself. Writing in the Muruj al-dhahab (GoldenMeadows) he describes the Harranian Sabians as follows:The Harranian Sabians have temples according to the names of the intellectualsubstances and the stars. To these temples belong: the temples of the first causeand of Intelligence, but I do not know whether it is the first or second Intelligence;also, the temple of world order, Necessity. The temple of the soul is round; ofSaturn, hexagonal; of Jupiter, triangular; of Mars, long (rectangular): the Sunsquare; that of Venus, a triangle in a quadrangle; that of Mercury, a triangle insidean elongated quadrangle, and that of the Moon, octagonal. The Sabians have inthem symbols and mysteries which they keep hidden.Sabians are a group of people mentioned in the Koran as one of three ‘Peoples ofthe Book,’ the other two being Jews and Christians. Under Islamic law, this meanttheir practices were permitted to exist in Muslim lands. It is quite clear that theSabians of Harran are not the Sabians of the Quran. (There is no agreement on whothe Quranic Sabians were, or if they even existed as a separate category. Broadconsensus appears to be they were likely some kind of Jewish splinter sect.) TheHarranian magicians and hermeticists are called Sabians thanks to some franklybrilliant legal advice. When the Abbasid Caliph passed through Harran on his way tomake war against the Byzantines, he accused the town of being pagan and demandedto know what religion its people practiced. Unsatisfied with the answer he received,‘we are Harranians’ he effectively told them to ‘get religion’ by the time he came backthrough or he’d put them to the sword. Luckily for Harran, the Byzantines put him tothe sword outside Sardis and he never returned. However, in the interim, they hadsought legal counsel from a Muslim jurist who suggested they declare themselves‘Sabians,’ who are protected under Islamic law. All they need do was present the‘book’ to which they belonged as its ‘people,’ as well as their ‘prophet.’ For their book,252"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"123they chose the Hermetic texts, and for their prophets, they chose Agathodaimon andHermes, adding that Hermes is also ‘Idris,’ the Muslim name for Enoch.It is important to realise that this cartoonish ploy did not fool the majority ofIslamic scholars for a second, but nevertheless, the legal protection remained.Mas’udi himself distinguishes several classes of Sabians in another of his texts, theKitab al-Tanbih. Tamara M. Green describes them in her excellent City of the MoonGod:The kings of Rum who were al-hanifa and al-sabi’un before they becameChristians.The emperor Julian was secretly a Sabian, and when he renounced Christianity,he re-erected the statues which the Sabians put up as images of the highestsubstances and the celestial bodies, and punished those who did not return to thefaith of the hanifs.The Egyptian Sabians, who honour Hermes and the Agathodaimon as theirprophets; the remnants of these Sabians are the Harranians. ‘They abstain frommany foods that the Greek Sabians (i.e. those mentioned above) eat, such as pork,chicken, garlic, beans and other things of this type; they regard as their prophetsAgathodaimon, Hermes, Homer, Aratus, Aryasis, Arani, the first and second of hisname.’The followers of Zaradrusht (Zoroaster), who formerly had embraced the creed ofthe hanifs.Writing in the late 1200s, the medieval Arab geographer Al-Dimashqiexemplifies the arms-length handling of the Harranians. He distinguishes two types ofSabians: those who worship idols and those who recognise the ‘cult of the celestialmansions.’ The Harranians fall into the latter category but he is under no illusions thatthese are the Sabians of the Quran, for they travel to the tombs of their prophets (theGiza pyramids) on pilgrimage. Despite their lack of scriptural authority, he consideredthem a useful source of esoteric information for Islam.This ‘devil you know’ relationship persisted from the very beginning of theIslamic period. Umar II, Caliph of Alexandria, even moved the school of medicine toHarran in 717 CE. The Caliphate clearly did not approve of the Harranian methods,but recognised that they needed them – like an early medieval MKULTRA, perhaps.Harran is steeped in biblical motifs, specifically astrological ones. Although253"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"there is no evidence for their physical existence, Harran is believed to have been thehome of Abraham, the first of the Three Patriarchs, whose brother was also namedHaran. Rather than rejecting it as irrelevant to their astrotheology, the Harraniansincorporated this association when it suited them. It formed part of their ‘legaljustification,’ for instance. But they also used Abraham’s name antagonistically (andprobably unwisely) in theological comparisons with Christianity and Islam. Accordingto the tenth century scholar, al-Biruni, the Harranians claimed Abraham left the citybecause he was suffering leprosy on his foreskin, and that is why he circumcisedhimself. The etymology of Abraham is unclear and contentious. There is the obviousphonic similarity to ‘Brahman’ which could suggest an earlier Eurasian layer. Itappears to mean ‘exalted,’ ‘multitude’ or ‘enlarging,’ which would be in keeping withGod’s covenant with Abraham. Interestingly, God specifically promises that thedescendants of Abraham would be ‘as numerous as the stars,’ another astrologicalmotif layered into the local geography of Harran and Göbekli Tepe.It is also worth remembering that Jacob had his ladder experience whiletravelling to the town of Harran, and in some versions of the Shemhazai/Azazel story,they descend to earth via Jacob’s Ladder. Plus, as we have seen, Harran was oncehome to multiple ‘towers’ with which one could ‘ascend’ to specific stars. Also recallthat most Islamic scholars found a workaround for their unease over the prominenceof Hermes in Harran by declaring him Idris, that is Enoch, who also ascended to thestars.As expected for a city that means ‘crossroads,’ the continuities were not simplyGraeco-Egyptian. Until the 11th century, the southeast gate of Harran’s citadel wasflanked by carvings of dogs, presumably for apotropaic reasons. This is likely acontinuity of Nergal as ‘My Lord with His Dogs.’ Assyrians would bury dogs undertheir threshold for similar apotropaic reasons. (The use of cynocephalic, or dog-headed saints, carved on the gates to or bridges into towns continued in Europe rightinto the Early Modern Period. The patron saint of travellers himself, St Christopher,was initially cynocephalic.)Remarkably, there are also legends of ‘The Head’ or head worship at Harran.When an earlier Abbasid Caliph, al-Ma’mun, passed through Harran, he accused theHarranians of being ‘Adherents of the Head.’ This apparently refers to practicesperformed on the head of a man who resembled ‘Utarid (Mercury). Acontemporaneous Arab historian describes what he believed to be the ritualassociated with this head cult: the man who resembled Mercury would be placed in avat of oil and borax until his joints relaxed. Then his head was pulled, stretching hisneck. This action was performed each time Mercury was ‘at its height.’ This head254"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"would then prophesy in tongues. We may assume such activity continuedposthumously as well, as the Ghayat al-Hakim, the Picatrix, contains several ritualsassociated with divination using severed heads, that bear a significant resemblance tothese Harranian practices. The Picatrix even attributes one of these rituals to ‘aphilosopher known under the name of Brahma of Brahman, who died in India.’ Thereare certainly Hindu spells that require the use of a head, one even requires it to be setup in opposition to the dragon – suggesting astrological components – but then there isalso simply Brahma/Abraham/Harran. Greene keenly observes that none of theaccounts of ‘head-omancy’ can be taken literally as, plainly, the Caliphate would nothave allowed such practices to continue. She considers them either religiouspropaganda – painting ‘the savages’ as human sacrificers – or symbolising someesoteric doctrine (or both).[W]ithin the context of the esoteric traditions surrounding the Harranians, the taleof ‘the Head’ may be merely a prosaic, if horrific, version of astrological oralchemical symbolism, reminiscent of the language found in Zosimus and otherworks on the esoteric sciences. It also has affinities with certain aspects ofapotropaic magic which found its way into Hermeticism. Proclus, for example,reports that Julianus the theurgist placed on the demarcation line against thebarbarians a human head made out of clay and consecrated by him; it was saidto have the power of sending down lightning upon the enemy wherever theywished to cross the border of the Empire.Having mentioned the Picatrix, it is important to recognise that, while Skinner isvery likely correct in tracing the egress into Europe of the Greek Magical Papyri – inthe form of the Hygromanteia – from Byzantium and by way of Venice, a significantvolume of magical practices also found their way onto the Continent via MoorishSpain, even if their impact on Christian Europe was lesser or, at least, more muddled.And a large amount of this Egypto-stellar wisdom that came through the Arab lineactually originated in (or at least passed through) Harran. During Córdoba’s height asthe capital of Moorish Spain, it had over seventy libraries, some of which had over halfa million books. At the same time, France’s Royal Library had 900.The ‘measurability challenge’ presents itself once again examining this vector. Isuspect the impact of Moorish Spain is underemphasised for linguistic and – at leastdomestically in Spain – prejudicial reasons. We trace the line of the grimoires andthen subsequently hermetics through Italy because it is more easily measurable.However, what is important to realise about the figure of Hermes Trismegistus is thathe became, particularly in Harran, a ‘storehouse’ of philosophical/scientificobservations of the universe as well as a plethora of ‘low’ or ‘folk’ magic practices –255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"grandmother survivals, if you will – pertaining to medicine, drawing down the power ofplanets and stars, making amulets and charms and facilitating pacts with variousastral intelligences. Greene says of him, ‘Hermes Trismegistus was the source of allknowledge previously known only to the gods: the explicator of the stars, the sacredhealer, the master alchemist.’Exploring what I suspect are more direct, localised magical continuities fromthe Arab line in the Iberian Peninsula does not invalidate the North Italian vector. Asever, we must resist singular explanations. Exiled to Brazil as a result of theInquisition of Lisbon, Antonia Maria describes a folk magic custom that is suggestiveof these continuities. She would sit in the doorway to a house and feed pieces of goat’smilk cheese to Barabbas, Satanas and Lucifer as offerings (which were followed up byfull meals cooked in their honour if/when her objective had been achieved). In Book 3,Chapter 7 of the Picatrix – which is described as explicitly Harranian magic in theoriginal Arab version – we find similar ritual activity: in an operation of Mars whichrequires the use of a young boy as seer, his mother sits in the doorway of the prayerhouse, holding a rooster, until called. The ritual is clearly derived from PGM-eraAlexandria: while his mother is in the doorway, the boy is adorned with animal skinsand has fire held under one foot and water held under the other. Eventually, the motheris called into the room and the priest beheads the rooster over the boy. As soon as theboy leaves the house, he puts on his index finger a ring bearing the image of an ape.Baboons were symbols of Thoth in Egypt and the rooster may simply be adomesticated continuity of a ‘bird’ as symbolic of passage between the physical andspiritual realms, such as we have seen depicted going back to Göbekli Tepe andbeyond.Elsewhere in the Picatrix, there are repeated references to Hermes as theteacher of these arts, descriptions of him as the lord of the ‘three flowers of things,’ aswell as specific rules for building cities and structures aligned to the stars and theplanets – and warnings for those who build during inauspicious times: ‘In founding acity, make use of fixed stars, and in building a house, make use of planets.’What are we to make of all this? There is, within a day’s ride of Göbekli Tepe, arecursion and layering of most of its significant features or motifs. The stars,specifically Orion and his surrounding corner of the sky; calendrical precision; thehead, or lack of head, as depicted by the T-shaped pillars; the belief that the area is aconduit for Antediluvian wisdom; dogs and the dog star; the descent of the two angelicteachers via Jacob’s Ladder – also in the area; and a stellar covenant with the Creatorin the form of the Abraham legend. All this at a crossroads, no less.256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"How do we account for the recurrence of these motifs over a span of tenthousand years, when ‘mouth to ear to mouth’ transmissions patently did not occur? Atthe Inhabited Sky conference in Madrid in May of 2015, Jacques Vallée made thefollowing observation: ‘In science, when there is a new phenomenon, you look forpatterns that can cut across culture, geography, and so on ... The UFO phenomenon... has constant features across time and space.’In the specific example of the area around Göbekli Tepe and Harran, as well asthe Near East more generally, we do indeed see patterns cutting across time. Thatthese patterns are commonly misinterpreted as either direct transmissions or simplynot being there at all returns us to the core of the problem Dr Naydler describedearlier in the chapter. Academia or materialistic inquiry is permanently ill-suited toexamining something it thinks does not exist.What is clearly needed is a methodology that can at least begin thinking in betterdirections. This would likely include some sort of unconscious resonance as well asJohn Keel’s notion of ‘window areas’; that there are some places in the world morelikely to be the scene of extreme paranormal events such as mass UFO sightings orthe Mothman of Point Pleasant. This analysis works backwards as well as forwards.Why was Göbekli Tepe built on this hill rather than that hill? Obviously, we will neverknow for sure, but the subsequent twelve thousand years of history suggests therevery likely was a reason, and given the persistence of explicit star lore in the region,we are justified in proposing some sort of contact event may have taken place at leastonce. Here is Jacques Vallée again, this time in his classic UFOs: The PsychicSolution.Throughout history the minds of men have been manipulated by sourcesapparently external to their environment. It has been a common theme in allthese communications that the purpose of the message was to show mankind away to enlightenment, to greater happiness, and to salvation, either fromphysical disasters or from dangers waiting for us beyond death itself ... Thehistorical importance of such communications has generally been trivial butoccasionally it has been profound. It has often resulted in the creation of smallgroups of priests or initiates who claimed direct contact with the higher entitiesor gods.THE BOY FROM LEAMINGTON SPAThere is always a risk when examining esoteric history that one marshals thepast to support one’s preferred worldview, which is certainly not my intention here. (In257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"any case, I am not a Thelemite.) Aleister Crowley sometimes fell into this ‘historicalworldview’ trap and sometimes didn’t. More interesting, from our perspective, are theresults and insights he received that were a poor match for the understanding ofhistory in his day but, in many respects, have been borne out by subsequentarchaeological discovery.AiwassBy necessity, we come at this story out of sequence. Crowley spent much of hislife, subsequent to encountering the being in Cairo in 1904, trying to work out exactlywhat or what type of thing Aiwass actually was, in addition to being the author of TheBook of the Law and his own Holy Guardian Angel.At the time of his death, he had come to the conclusion that Aiwass was a type ofextraterrestrial/extradimensional entity, one of a race of beings intimately involvedwith the instruction and teaching of mankind. To Crowley, he was ‘a messenger fromthe forces ruling this earth at present.’ Kenneth Grant described Aiwass as ‘a type ofextra-terrestrial Intelligence such as we may expect to come into conscious contactwith, as the aeon develops.’ Although it forms a surprisingly small component ofThelemic cosmology, Crowley makes it clear that Aiwass is far from alone ‘up there.’The universe is filled with extradimensional beings seeking contact with earth. Viewedin light of Dr Vallée’s previous comment, we read in Magick Without Tears:My observation of the Universe convinces me that there are beings ofintelligence and power of a far higher quality than anything we can conceive ofas human; that they are not necessarily based on the cerebral and nervousstructures that we know; and that the one and only chance for mankind toadvance as a whole is for individuals to make contact with such Beings.Aiwass was more than that, though. To his credit, Crowley attempted to keeppace with the archaeological and scientific discoveries of his time. Although bothhypotheses were subsequently shown to be inaccurate, in Crowley’s day it wasbelieved that the Yezidi were a direct survival of Sumerian spiritual practice – the‘Devil’ in Yezidi belief being Sumeria’s supreme deity – and that Sumeria itself wasthe oldest complex culture on earth. Crowley came to associate Aiwass with thishypothetical Sumerian/Yezidi supreme deity.Further confirmation for this belief arrived while Crowley was living in NewYork in the form of Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs, an Azerbaijani immigrant who shared hispassion for Kabalistic ‘word games.’ The middle name – which Jacobs himselfbelieved meant Satan – was only the first synchronicity to pique Crowley’s interest.258"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Jacobs also provided a Hebrew spelling for Aiwass that gave the number 93 –something that had eluded him.A combination of Kabalistic ‘confirmation,’ his personal magical experience andsome imprecise historical information led Crowley to write in commentary to hisBook of the Law that ‘Aiwaz is not (as I had supposed) a mere formula, like manyangelic names, but is the true most ancient name of the God of the Yezidis, and thusreturns to the highest Antiquity. Our work is therefore historically authentic, therediscovery of the Sumerian Tradition. (Sumer is in lower Mesopotamia, the earliesthome of our race).’It is interesting to observe that while Crowley was wrong about the earliesthome of our race and the origins of his particular cosmology in Sumeria, one canalmost support his case for ‘highest Antiquity,’ given the subsequent archaeologicaldiscoveries of the last fifty years and the emergence of the Laurasian hypothesis.EgyptAs already discussed, the Egyptology of Aleister Crowley’s day is hugelyinaccurate when compared to its modern iteration. This is to be expected as Crowleywas born only a few decades after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone: interpreting thewritings of the Ancient Egyptians was a new field. The understanding of the pyramids’function was even worse, typically formed by solar-obsessive, Christian antiquarianswho saw sun worship everywhere. An intellectual fudge that allowed them to painthistorical peoples as primitive while simultaneously aligning their practices with abroadly Jude-ochristian arc.I have been unable to find any evidence that Crowley had read the PyramidTexts prior to receiving The Book of the Law in 1904 on his second visit to Egypt. Incorrespondence with Exeter University’s Tobias Churton – author of Aleister Crowley:The Biography and The Beast In Berlin: Art, Sex, and Magick in the Weimar Republic– he writes that he is nevertheless confident that Crowley was familiar with them,given his long friendship with the Egyptologist (and Theosophist) Battiscombe Gunn. Ifhe had read the Pyramid Texts prior to 1904, these would have been some of GastonMaspero’s sporadically published – but well-translated – articles. A complete versionof the Pyramid Texts was only made available after the reception of The Book of theLaw. This is significant because of the oft-commented-upon similarity betweenCrowley’s remarkable case of automatic writing and its similarity to the PyramidTexts, as well as many of the spells of the New Kingdom’s Books of the Dead. Onespell in particular could almost be considered a concise version of The Book of the259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Law. That is Spell 177 – which I’ve given earlier on pages 116 and 117 – widelyregarded as and fairly obviously a clean continuity from the Pyramid Texts. Go backand re-read it.There are a number of ways, all valid and useful, with which to interpretCrowley’s reception of The Book of the Law. The first observation is that it clearlydemonstrates Crowley’s lifelong obsession with what we might uncharitably call the‘Victorian Tantric’ worldview. On this particular trip to Egypt, he had arrived afterspending time in South Asia. (Including in what may have been part of Sundaland’ssphere of influence, which may be synchronistically significant to this book’s thesis.Similarly, recall also that Gerald Gardner spent much of his professional life in whatwas once Sundaland.) The universe as expressed in The Book of the Law displaysmechanics that are far more ‘sexual’ than those found in the Pyramid Texts.The second observation, entirely expected in any case of automatic writing, themind of the recipient heavily influences the subsequent text. Churton, in his biographyof Crowley, sees parallels in his writing as well. Below is an excerpt from Crowley’splay, Tannhäuser.Isis am I, and from my life are fedAll stars and suns, all moons that wax and wane,Create and uncreate, living and dead,The Mystery of Pain.I am the Mother, I the silent Sea,The Earth, its travail, its fertility.Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness,Return to me –To Me!Churton observes, correctly to my mind, that this whole sequence is resonant ofthe words of Nuit he was to receive later in The Book of the Law. ‘To Me!’ in particular.He writes that ‘key elements of that revolutionary little book were already coalescingsomewhere in Crowley’s extraordinary mind.’260"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Clearly there were certain aspects that Crowley brought with him to the rentedapartment during those fateful days in Cairo. There is also the fact that the trinity ofgods, although Egyptian, do not form a trinity at any time in Dynastic Egypt, whichCrowley would have been aware of. That said, in The Dark Lord, Levenda remarks:Egyptian religion went through many changes over the course of its roughlythree thousand – four thousand years of history. Gods and goddesses changedattributes over time, changed rulerships and characteristics, and even parentage... Thus one could make the argument – perhaps only slightly frivolously – thatthe Book of the Law represents a new iteration of the Egyptian religion andcontinues the developmental process begun in the pre-Dynastic era.There was something about this experience that stayed with the mastermagician his entire life, and yet his diaries are filled with other multi-day, spirit-contactoperations, ranging from New York to Paris, from the shores of Loch Ness to thedeserts of North Africa. Singular explanations remain unsatisfactory in the case of TheBook of the Law. Crowley brought his own mind to the experience but, at the sametime, there were also some remarkable synchronicities of the type discussed in theprevious section, as well as some as yet unexamined alignments with our emergingunderstanding of Laurasian or Palaeolithic spirituality. Let us consider the sequence ofevents.November 22nd, 1903: Aleister and his new wife Rose, honeymooning in Egypt,secured private evening access to the King’s Chamber. Crowley performed amodified version of the Headless Rite from the Greek Magical Papyri, discussed inthe next section. The chamber filled with a ‘brightness as of full moonlight.’ FromParis to Marseilles to Naples to Egypt, the honeymoon continued on to Ceylon.March 16th, 1904: Crowley and Rose moved into a rented Cairo apartment,having arrived in Egypt – their second visit – in February. Crowley performs the sameinvocation in an attempt to have Rose see the sylphs again. She does not, but shebecomes agitated, claiming she is hearing messages.March 17th, 1904: Rose continues to hear messages for her husband, claimingthey are ‘all about the child’ or ‘all about Osiris.’ Crowley wrote that Thoth wasinvoked ‘with great success.’ An annular eclipse occurred in the sky. Churton writes ofit: ‘the eclipse was heightened by Venus, the morning star in Aquarius. It faded,reappeared, and caused a stunning ring of fire, bulging toward Venus’s silvery glow.’That evening, Rose claimed that their waiter was actually Horus, and that Crowleyhad offended him.261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"March 18th, 1904: Crowley, already suspecting he had offended Horus,magically ‘cross-examined’ his wife. She passed the test and insisted her husbandinvoke Horus in ‘a new way.’March 19th – 21st, 1904: Exact dates differ, but over this weekend and into theMonday, Crowley invoked Horus unsuccessfully, then successfully, and also took hiswife to the Cairo Museum as part of her ongoing testing to she if she recognised anyimages of Horus. Here, famously, Rose pointed out what Crowley came to call theStele of Revealing, which carried the catalogue number 666. The stele depicted aleopard-skin-adorned priest, Ankh f-n Khonsu, bowing before an enthroned, falcon-headed Horus, with a winged sundisk above the scene, topped with the arching body ofNuit. Crowley, astounded, insisted on a translation.March 22nd – April 7th, 1904: The diary entries between the museum incidentand the subsequent reception of The Book of the Law have some holes in them. (Notuncommon for a man with an appetite for clandestine homosexual behaviour and aninterest in younger Arab men.) Crowley appears to have done nothing on March 22nd,and then, before receiving its translation, begun interpreting the stela from the 23rdwith an invocation of Thoth. From an historical authenticity perspective, hisinterpretation was poor. Crowley saw the ritual described as one ‘of sex.’ He linkedNuit with Sagittarius because her arching body looked like a bow. Because theSagittarian bow/arrow is associated with genitals, this allowed him to layer on thesame ‘Victorian tantric’ interpretation he slapped over everything. Using tarot cards,he identified the priest Ankh f-n Khonsu with Mercury and Aries; and ‘Mars in thehouse of Venus exciting the jealousy of Saturn or Vulcan.’ Saturn, as the tarot trump‘The Universe’ was associated with Nuit. What is interesting about this frantic, terribleinterpretation is that Crowley knew better. He was a proud Cambridge Classicsdropout and a lifelong student of history. When he got like this, when he caught – shallwe say – ‘acute correspondomania,’ it indicates someone attempting to unpack anextreme synchronicity before the term had been coined. Indeed, in his biography of theman, Churton writes, ‘Crowley’s assertion that it was the stela’s discovery that led tothe ritual which led to The Book of the Law’s dictation suggests the important factorwas the stela’s discovery, not necessarily its translation.’Whilst he would go on to construct a ritual that facilitated contact with Aiwassover the 8th, 9th and 10th of April, it was the encounter with the extremely unlikely –with High Strangeness – that he considered the cornerstone of the experience. Herewas the universe noticing him. Here was Contact.The Headless Rite262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"•Described by Jake Stratton-Kent as ‘the single most important ritual in modernmagic’ is an invocation from the Greek Magical Papyri known as The Headless Rite.Emerging from the Alexandrian chaos that birthed the Western grimoire tradition, TheStele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist is one of the more concise and potent invocations foundin the entire collection. Crowley did not know it as the Headless Rite. Crowley, orsomeone in his circle, poorly renamed the ritual. Stratton-Kent describes thisunfortunate transliteration in his The Headless One:Either Mathers or Crowley set a fashion for interpreting the phrase ‘headlessone’ – which recurs throughout the original – as meaning ‘without beginning’ andaccordingly altered the phrasing to ‘Bornless One.’ [...]Sometime between [the publication of the ritual in English and 1904], someperson or persons unknown adapted the ritual and altered the name ‘headless’ to‘bornless,’ on the assumption that since ‘Resh’ in Hebrew means ‘head orbeginning’ then the term ‘headless’ might be read as ‘thou who art withoutbeginning – unborn and undying.’ In other words, the ‘translation’ relies onHebrew etymology, which of course need not necessarily connect with a Greco-Egyptian ritual.Despite the freewheeling approach to the translation, Crowley understood it haddefinite Osirian notes. The operant describes him or herself as the ‘angel of PaphroOsonnophris’ or ‘pharaoh Osiris.’ He used variants of it regularly throughout his life.The two most important times were on these two visits to Egypt. Of the second visit,in which Crowley attempted to use it to create werelights for his wife again andinstead ended up with The Book of the Law, Stratton-Kent writes:This is perhaps an indicator of the limitations of the will of the magician, who,producing a ritual for specific purpose, on synthetic lines, overlooks thepossibility that what he is adapting has a life of its own. This ritual certainlyproduced a significant result, but this did not remotely resemble the resultintended. This is a point I wish the reader to bear carefully in mind ...Given Crowley’s awareness that it was an incident of High Strangeness ratherthan his self-proclaimed mastery that was of most significance, it is worth consideringthe events in that same light, with a renewed understanding of historical veracity.Headlessness: Even with the name change, Crowley was performing a ritualwith a distinctly Laurasian motif, possibly even Gondwanan. Consider the T-shaped, ‘headless’ pillars uncovered at Göbekli Tepe, a hunters’ temple pointingat Orion and Sirius that involves ‘heavenly beings’ descending to earth. Göbekli263"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"•••••Tepe lay undiscovered until almost fifty years after Crowley’s death.Osiris/Orion: Continuing the ‘headless’ and ‘hunting’ theme, Crowley performedan invocation to Osiris inside a stone map of Osiris (the Great Pyramid), thatcontains the same ‘up to the sky and back’ journey found in the Pyramid Texts;another Laurasian motif, perhaps the Laurasian motif. Crowley was unaware ofGiza’s Orion Correlation, as well as the headless hunter motif associated withOrion in some of the oldest cultures on earth.Venus and the eclipse: Crowley began performing the ‘Bornless/Headless Rite’the day before and the day of some visually impressive space weather.Atmospheric and stellar events are regularly associated with UFO contactexperiences. He would go on to have just such an experience. Possibly relatedis the continuance of the headless motif into Christianity with St John the Baptist,who, as Venus, ‘precedes’ the dawn that is Christ. He is headless.Aiwass: The being that appeared as a result of this ‘accidental reactivation of thespaceship’ came to be associated in Crowley’s mind with the god of the Yezidis,dating back to Sumeria. Whilst it does not date back to Sumeria, the central godof the Yezidis probably came from a Neolithic buzzard cult that is a likelycontinuance of the ‘bird on a stick’ stone objects found at places such as GöbekliTepe and nearby Çatalhöyük. Both sites demonstrate some of the earliest motifssubsequently to turn up in Old Kingdom Egypt. Crowley would eventuallyconsider this evidently-very-ancient-being ‘from high antiquity’ to be some formof extraterrestial intelligence involved with the teaching of mankind.The Stele of Revealing: The 25th Dynasty stela pointed out by Rose is neitherold nor important by Egyptian standards. Examined under this new light,however, a few things emerge. Firstly, Ankh f-n Khonsu is dressed in a leopardskin, reminiscent of the earliest Heb Sed ritual garb (itself a nod back to itsshamanic origins). Secondly, the stela itself is atypical in its inscriptions: itblends Ra-Horakhty (Horus of the Horizon) with Sokar-Osiris; Sokar being theearliest known god of the Giza plateau and an early form of Osiris, and the Gizaplateau being where Crowley performed his Osiris ritual, of course, in a stellar-aligned structure ‘activated’ by Horus of the Horizon. Finally, it is rare for itsreverse side containing two spells from the New Kingdom Book of the Dead – avery old set of spells by the 25th Dynasty.

For tens of thousands of years we havebuilt stellar temples ‘for the chance of union’ with the stars.VectorsAleister Crowley retains his importance for much of western occultism, but hiswider significance needs to be considered alongside such events as the Miracle atFatima, Andrija Puharich’s famous séance in a Maine farmhouse where he contactedthe Nine, the Betty and Barney Hill incident and other paranormal events that haveoutsized cultural impact. Indeed, outsized cultural impact could even be marshalled tosupport claims of veracity for these events without saying anything about their actualcontent or implications. In UFOs: The Psychic Solution, Jacques Vallée writes:We have encountered a multi-faceted phenomenon and we are trying very hardto ignore it, because it does not fit into any neat categories and refuses to bedragged under a microscope to be examined. Instead, it appears to seekconfrontation with us on its own terms.Crowley’s outsized cultural impact covers novels, music, comics, secretmilitary programmes such as the Stargate Project and the development of the modernspace programme itself. His enigmatic experiences and their impressive influenceover the twentieth century point toward the underlying reality of phenomena that haveplayed a part, for whatever reason, in the cultural, spiritual and technologicaldevelopment of mankind. These phenomena have persisted throughout the humanjourney, they have always been ambivalent, their ultimate motivations opaque and theycontinue to persist to the present day.265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"XAstronomers seem terrified of actually finding somethingimportant.Jacques Vallée, FastwalkerCHILDREN OF THEMOTHER OF HEAVENObservations are not explanations. It is self-evident that we need a biggerparadigm. In the west, history gave us a monotheism that either denied or ignored thelong-lived human experience of spirit encounters. It was this monotheism that gavebirth to a materialistic vision of the universe that itself denies the existence of anythingnonphysical, reaching the apogee of absurdity with its fiat ‘solve’ for ‘the hard problemof consciousness’: no such thing exists! From an interpretive standpoint, this leaveswestern discourse with not very much room to manoeuvre. Publicly, we have whatamounts to two equally unsatisfying vectors of enquiry. Firstly, there are theresearchers working within the academic mainstream who are unlikely to findsomething they do not believe exists. Secondly, there are those working outside theacademic mainstream who are fixated on finding something they believe exists –evidence for physical extraterrestrial intervention – but probably doesn’t. Or, at least,not in the way it is commonly presented.The main shortcoming of the extraterrestrial hypothesis is that it remainshamstrung by materialism and undervalues the impact of consciousness and psieffects, which have been scientifically observed for over a century. Its narrative stillrevolves around physical aliens appearing in physical space ships that subsequentlytrigger a swathe of cargo cults among physical savages here on earth. The principle ofparsimony suggests we should at least begin with a psi or consciousnessinterpretation, but this isn’t to say that both possibilities were not in play at least oncein human history. Indeed, none other than Carl Sagan went so far as to estimate thenumber of times extraterrestrials have visited earth in the human era. He speculatedthat if some sort of ‘Galactic survey ship’ had noticed the appearance of Proconsul, ahuman ancestor, some 25 million years ago, then the rate of sampling or monitoringmay have increased from that time, ‘perhaps to once every ten thousand years.’Sagan suggested that that contact would have increased even more since the266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"beginning of the post-glacial era as mankind increased in cultural and technologicalcomplexity and that if the intervening time between contacts has been reduced down toa few thousand years then ‘there is a possibility that contact with an extraterrestrialcivilization occurred within historical times.’ Sagan’s ‘possibility’ is, to my mind,highly likely. That still leaves us with big question marks hanging over whether suchencounters had any impact on human cultural development, ‘historical times’ beingrather recent, after all.In his unjustly maligned The Sirius Mystery, Robert Temple agrees withSagan’s hypothesis and speculates that if a physical extraterrestrial encounteroccurred, it would have been between 5,000 BCE and 3,000 BCE – a time he calls theContact Era – and it was this encounter that triggered the dramatic increase in socialcomplexity we observe in Sumeria and Egypt at the time. While this astonishingincrease in social complexity is still lacking a satisfactory explanation or explanations,this book has hopefully shown there are enough observable antecedents to the beliefs,practices, spirits and gods of Sumeria and Egypt to make the singular explanation,‘because aliens,’ insufficient. That being said, it is certainly worth observing in passingthat the publication of The Sirius Mystery attracted constant CIA interference, includingthe wholesale theft of Temple’s only copy of the translation of the original Frenchsource material, The Pale Fox, by a CIA asset in London in the 1970s as well asattempts to block the book’s republication in the 1990s. Quite why the CIA would beinterested in an anthropological account of hypothetical psychic contact between theDogon tribe and beings from the Sirius system that has apparently been ‘discredited’has not been adequately explained. We have some ideas.Despite this intriguing interlude, and the supporting opinions of some veryinformed experts, we must return to that notion of parsimony by looking first to thatwhich has not only been scientifically observed, but continues to operate on andinteract with mankind into the present day; namely, a consciousness- or psi-based,largely nonphysical interaction or experience, rather than an explicitly ExtraterrestrialHypothesis (ETH). The ETH approach matches the available archaeological data lessand less with each passing year, as more information regarding the complexity of thePalaeolithic as well as an increasingly precise understanding of hominin populationmovements comes to light. We should expect that trend to continue.NON-HUMAN LOGICAlthough sometimes admirably explored in science fiction, the ETH alsoregularly fails the non-human logic test. Why would an interplanetary species, havingtravelled across the vast reaches of space, set about insisting we naked apes build267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"them triangular piles of rocks? If they came to teach us, why did they teach us how toscratch and scribble in river-clay tablets and not teach us cold fusion? Palaeolithicbrains were actually larger than modern brains. Why did school end halfway throughkindergarten? Why – when mankind itself is but a decade away from capturingasteroids made of diamond, orbiting them around the moon and using robots to minethem – did an interplanetary species fly past mineralogically rich, unoccupied planetsand planetoids to build squishy chimps to mine gold on this one?Here is where the practical magical perspective – until quite recently unheard in(public) discussions in the UFO/UAP field – can be particularly useful. Magicianshave personal experience of non-human logic; what it feels like, how it manifests inlife and culture, and so on. It is characterised by atemporality, high levels ofcoincidence, repetition of motif and symbol in entirely unrelated contexts and a quasi-fractal capacity to look weirdly resonant at whatever level you observe thephenomenon, from the micro to the macro. We could almost, and probably should,use these experiences as yardsticks to measure the ‘non-humanity’ of particularsignals or collections of experience, based on the reasonable hypothesis that non-human intelligences would communicate in non-human ways.As an example of this sort of non-human ‘cluster’ communication, we might useThe Sirius Mystery and its author. Before writing it, Robert Temple was a friend andstudent of Arthur M. Young, twentieth century inventor and mystic (and genius,frankly). This gives us a vector running through Young’s central American mushroomresearch – thus touching on one of this book’s cornerstone hypotheses – hissubsequent involvement with channelling Egyptian/extraterrestrial spirit beings knownas the Nine – thus touching another – through to his sharing with Robert Temple theoriginal anthropological work regarding the Dogon that would underpin The SiriusMystery, a book that was encouraged into publication by Temple’s friend, Arthur C.Clarke. Prior to striking up this friendship, when Clarke observed the psi abilities ofUri Geller – a Mossad asset whose CIA handler, Andrija Puharich, accompaniedYoung on his mushroom field trip – he said it was ‘Childhood’s End come to life.’Geller was briefly involved with the remote viewers who would go on to accuratelypsychically view parts of our solar system (and its apparent inhabitants) and alsoclaimed to be in communication with an artificial intelligence communicating with himbackwards through time. Childhood’s End is one of Clarke’s many science fictionnovels. It describes a postwar earth where aliens that look exactly like medievaldemons rule from an orbiting spaceship, institute a soft-fascist regime of global peace,and whose presence begins to trigger psi powers in a growing number of children.(Yes, it’s excellent.) This was the book, rather than 2001, that Stanley Kubrick actually268"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"wanted to turn into a film before claiming it was ‘too expensive’ to shoot, which ispatently untrue for someone of his skill and genius. Temple himself visited the set of2001: A Space Odyssey in London, thus providing a speculative fiction overlap with thenotion of extradimensional/psi/extraterrestrial involvement in the development of thehuman species (as well as an overlap with problematizing the Apollo missions). Afterall this, it was reading The Sirius Mystery that inspired a young Robert Bauval to goon to investigate and then publish his work on Giza’s Orion correlation in The OrionMystery. All of this happened before the discovery of a 12,000 year old star temple,complete with 2001 ish ‘monoliths,’ pointing at Orion and Sirius. This allows us toclose the loop, so to speak, back into the psi/entheogen/ancient astrotheology narrative(and its implications) that is the subject of the book you are holding.As is the case with most of ‘alternate history,’ what looks to uncritical minds likeconspiratorial knowledge passed down through the generations looks to my eyes likeextradimensional agency operating at decidedly non-human timescales and for non-transparent purposes. (Fold the Crowley/Giza stuff from the previous chapter into thesame through-line and it gets really interesting.) No one in the above chain of geniusesand remarkable researchers is working for ‘the Illuminati.’ Instead, we observe acontinuum that you can ‘step into’ at any of the previously described ‘nodes’ and stillend up viewing the same motif or narrative. It is non-sequential communication.Which seems to me to better support an extradimensional/consciousness hypothesisthan the ETH.LITTLE GREEN MENThe hypothesis that mankind’s civilising gods or spirits were, too use a cheekilydisparaging term, ‘little green men,’ relies on taking literally a personally preferredancient mythology, typically the Sumerian one. However, as we have seen, these aremuch, much younger variants of older spirits and storylines that, by definition, cannotliterally be true, just as the reboot of a film is not the original film. At best, one couldargue that there was an original contact event that triggered the emergence of aLaurasian storyline 20,000 to 30,000 years ago but such an argument – like anythingelse – has the ever present obligation of proof. For example, if ‘they’ taught us writing,why did we wait so long to use it?There is also the observation, first described by Jacques Vallée five decadesago, that the phenomena are simply too common to have been the nuclei around whichour original religions have formed. 13% of Americans today – more than thirty millionpeople – believe they have been abducted by or otherwise encountered aliens, andthese are just the ones that will admit it. Religions rarely form around experiences so269"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"common. Instead, there appears to be near continuous, albeit enigmatic, contact orobservation with somethings throughout human history. Certainly these encounters oran explanation of them would have been, have been, incorporated into spiritualsystems, but one has to be extremely selective with the evidence to suggest theseevents or beings triggered our first religions.Finally, the suggestion that ‘little green men’ are mankind’s original teachersfails to account for the varying levels of technological complexity in cultures thatsupposedly received these teachings, as well as the clear evidence of uneven –sometimes declining, sometimes advancing – levels of technological sophistication.Instead, what we observe is the previously described ‘runaway climate change’ effectthat increased technological sophistication appears coincident with increasedastronomical sophistication and declines along the same lines. Whether there is acausal relationship is almost beside the point if there is a ‘consciousnessentanglement’ effect in place. One indicates the other in such a scenario. When theteacher is ‘in the classroom,’ we learn things. When the teacher is absent we do not. Asingular explanation cannot account for this.A CONSCIOUSNESS EFFECT MODELOne of the myths most commonly cited by proponents of the ‘ancient alienstheory’ is the Vedic motif of the vimanas. Vimanas are artificial aircraft used byvarious gods and asuras to fly about the world and occasionally attack other aircraft orground targets. This would seem to be a startlingly precise description of ‘alien’spacecraft were it not for the fact that, just like Ezekiel’s vision and other ‘mythologicaldescriptions’ of supposed UFOs, calling these craft ‘aerodynamically ambitious’would be a kindness. And so there is an element of ‘burying the lead’ here becausethere are some compelling data to be extracted from these stories once one lets go ofone’s preferred interpretation. For instance, when the asura, King Salva, attackedKrishna’s city of Dwarka, his vimana was observed to split apart, bounce along thesurface of the ocean, and reabsorb its various split parts back into a whole, all whileKrishna was firing projectiles at him from the city. Viewed dispassionately, this isremarkably reminiscent of Norway’s ‘Hessdalen Lights’; an aerial phenomenonobserved with surprising regularity. They also appear to behave as if consciouslycontrolled and regularly split apart from each other before reforming, often movingaround or through the mountains around the Hessdalen valley at tremendous speeds.The story of King Salva and the Hessdalen Lights offers some compelling parallels tothe 9th century Lyon story of Magonia that gave Jacques Vallée the title to hismasterwork, Passport to Magonia. Bishop Agobard of Lyon observed a sky battlebetween competing wizards from the cloud realm of Magonia. Several occupants of270"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"•••one of the downed craft were even captured and kept for days. There is nothing in thegood bishop’s account that suggests these ‘wizards’ had descended from the clouds toteach us about genetics or quantum computing. Mostly it is just complaints about thedamage the Magonians caused to the local crops.What this suggests is that there is a continuity of observation that can be used tocalibrate ancient anomalous encounters that all-too-many of us hastily throw onto the‘proof of aliens’ bonfire. To say these beings ‘aren’t’ aliens is not to rob the myths oftheir potency. This very book rests on the proven hypothesis that local mythology canbe a container for recognisable astronomical, climatic and consciousness-basedexperiences. The ‘container assumption’ is required to interrogate what I believe to bethe circumstantial mapping of the human journey out of Africa and the subsequentuneven rise of cultural and spiritual complexity. Such a mapping better incorporates‘complexity pivot points’ including:Encountering entheogens in the food supply and their resulting cultural impact.The rise of precision astronomy in cultures where it is technologicallyredundant.The notion that it was the (often enthegeonically-contacted) spirits that gavemankind astronomical and navigational skills, as well as conferring kingship.Using a wider model accounts for the capricious nature or presentation of thesephenomena. If they are our ‘teachers’ then they are crack-addicted relief teachers whoonly show up to steal the lightbulbs from the faculty lounge. The universe owes usnothing and it is only our deep-seated psychological need for structure that attributessuch nobility to the motives of phenomena that have never demonstrated a coherentawareness of human morality, whatever and however useful that may be. Caveatemptor.A ‘capricious, sporadic spirit contact’ model not only leaves the door open for theperfectly reasonable – although currently, materially irrelevant – suggestion that earthhas been visited by physical extraterrestrials at some stage in human history, it alsoprovides a least worst set of assumptions with which we may explore these so-calledteachings.‘TEACHING MACHINE’ EXPERIENCESPerhaps one of the only genuinely global spiritual beliefs – found in bothLaurasian and Gondwanan cultures and thus suggesting it is Pan-Gaean – is the notionthat mankind was instructed in the ways of magic, culture, language, law and271"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"123technology by the spirits. We invented very little. We were shown most of it.An example from historical times, wellknown to western magicians, may beuseful in ‘backcasting’ certain scenarios; that is the creation of the Enochian alphabetand magical system by John Dee and Edward Kelley. The Enochian phase of Dee’sfascinating life began in 1582 when Kelley saw an angel, ‘the hythe of a little chylde,’who profers them a shewstone. Dee would subsequently employ Edward Kelley as aseer and the two of them would go on to receive/create an alphabet and hundreds ofwords that are ‘wrong’ in the sense that they do not exist but are remarkablyconsistent on an internal basis. This would be comparable to the experiences ofAndrija Puharich and Uri Geller when the later began to receive tensor equations thatwere also ‘wrong’ but internally consistent, and certainly well beyond themathematical skills of a stage magician. Incidentally, Enochian words also appearsporadically in the ‘channelled’ UFO literature of the mid-twentieth century.Both Sumerian and Egyptian writing have observed pictographic antecedentsbut, especially in the case of Egyptian hieroglyphs, this is sort of like calling the wheelthe direct antecedent of the stealth bomber. A strictly materialist, evolutionaryhypothesis looks inadequate, especially when the Egyptians flatly stated that Thoth –who lives on the moon, by the way – taught them writing and when we have a numberof similar experiences observed in the historical era. Jacques Vallée opens UFOs:The Psychic Solution with five statements that will be useful in cohering thesephenomena with an expanded view of human history as provided by genetics,linguistics and geology.The things we call unidentified flying objects are neither objects nor flying. Theycan dematerialize, as some recent photographs show, and they violate the laws ofmotion as we know them.UFOs have been seen throughout history and have consistently received (orprovided) their own explanation within the framework of each culture. In antiquitytheir occupants were regarded as gods; in medieval times, as magicians; in thenineteenth century, as scientific geniuses. And finally, in our own time, asinterplanetary travellers. (Statements made by occupants of the 1897 airshipincluded such declarations as ‘We are from Kansas’ and even ‘We are fromANYWHERE ... but we’ll be in Cuba tomorrow.’)UFO reports are not necessarily caused by visits from space travellers. Thephenomenon could be a manifestation of a much more complex technology. If timeand space are not as simple in structure as physicists have assumed until now,272"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"45then the question ‘where do they come from?’ may be meaningless: they couldcome from a place in time. If consciousness can be manifested outside the body,then the range of hypotheses can be even wider.The key to an understanding of the phenomenon lies in the psychic effects itproduces (or psychic awareness it makes possible) in its observers. Their livesare often deeply changed, and they develop unusual talents with which they mayfind it difficult to cope.Contact between human percipients and the UFO phenomenon occurs underconditions controlled by the latter. Its characteristic feature is a constant factor ofabsurdity that leads to a rejection of the story by the upper layers of the targetsociety and an absorption at a deep unconscious level of the symbols conveyed inthe encounter.In the light of these five statements, as well as the experiences of Dee andGeller, it is useful to consider a story told to Vallée in the early 1970s by an engineerwho encountered anomalous phenomena during an archaeological field trip when hewas still a student. This engineer wandered away from the group, came to a clearingbehind some trees and encountered a twenty-foot-wide disc with a translucentelevator that transported him aboard. ‘As in a dream or a movie,’ the vehicle instantlytransported him to a desolate area and deposited him on a hilltop beside a five-by-twenty-foot computer. (The encounter happened in the early 60s). He spent what hethought was three hours with the computer, reading row after row of ‘recordings’ thattransmitted ‘advanced information’ directly into his mind, before the disc returned andflew him back to the same spot. What he thought was three hours turned out to be 18days. His father, a government official (which may or may not be relevant), had hadthe military out looking for him. The engineer still had impeccable clothing, the flowerin his lapel had not decayed and he did not need a shave. In the following six months,the man required an abnormal amount of sleep, 13 hours a night, after which heneeded less and less. At the time of his encounter with Dr Vallée, over a decade later,he said he still only needed a few hours a night, and had not had, or at least recalled, asingle dream since the incident. His experiences at university changed as well: heinstantly understood and recalled with perfect clarity everything he was taught. Healso believed he had psychokinetic powers as well as the ability to astral project atwill.If you swap the giant, 1960s computer with the classic shamanic ‘Otherworld,’then this is a story as old as time. But even the presence of the computer is quiteillustrative. These phenomena appear in the most technologically advanced way273"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"possible for each individual culture, which is why over the last 150 years the aerialcomponents have gone from airships in the late 1800s, to flying saucers in the midtwentieth century to triangles or chevrons in a post-stealth-bomber world. As a thoughtexperiment, let us replace this engineer with, for example, Imhotep, and keep the storythe same. Imhotep vanishes for days and then returns with stories of encountering thegods wherein they showed him how to liquefy and pour rock ‘in honour of Them.’ Thecomplete design for Djoser’s Heb Sed temple, right down to the exact number of falsedoors and pylons, is recalled with perfect clarity. This temple reliably replicates thespirit contact experience Imhotep himself went through. He remains in psychiccontact with his tutelary gods, Ptah and Thoth, for the rest of his life and often sleep-journeys back to visit them for further tuition.Let us try another thought experiment, and jump back 10,000 years fromImhotep to a Eurasian shaman. He is not overly interested in improvements tostoneworking technology, but he is interested in knowing which valleys the deer willrun down upon their return from the north. Unlike Imhotep, his spirits do not transporthim to a gleaming stone city but to an open plain under a warm, clear night sky, wheregreat fires have been lit and masked revellers feast and dance under constellationsboth familiar and unfamiliar. Nevertheless, he returns with a precise map of thevalleys and rivers where the deer will run and the men of his tribe have a successfulhunting season that year. He begins to sing to the constellations he recognises fromhis night journey. They ask for stones to be erected in their honour.This sort of sustained, culture-specific form of contact is what Dr Vallée refersto as a ‘control system.’If the hypothesis is true, then what the witnesses have seen were manifestationsof a process not unlike that of a thermostat in a house. The thermostat is amechanism that stabilises the relationship between our body temperaturerequirements and the changing weather outside. Similarly, UFOs may serve tostabilize the relationship between man’s consciousness needs and the evolvingcomplexities of the world which he must understand.Let us return, then, to Robert Temple’s notion of a ‘Contact Era’ between 5,000BCE and 3,000 BCE. Viewed without the automatically-appended context of physicalalien visitation, there is much to recommend a modified version of the concept.Specifically, that would be an improved and improving capacity for experiencing oreven deliberately triggering whatever the phenomena we have just explored actually‘are.’ Such a ‘modified Contact Era’ model would go a considerable way to providingan improved explanation/interpretation for the similarities between the ‘original274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"civilisations’ of Indus, Sumer and Egypt that cannot be accounted for via trade andgenetic contact: we could go so far as to suggest they may have been having similar‘teaching machine’ experiences viewed through the lenses of their respective cultures.COUNTER-CHECKING THE HYPOTHESISOn the surface, it may seem an entirely reasonable objection to say that wesimply do not know the contents of the ancient mind, thus any attempt to do so is pureconjecture. Such a sentiment typically emerges out of academia’s post-traumatic,postmodernist response to the cosy universalism of an earlier age. Any form ofcomparative analysis is largely so woefully out of fashion that it has been relegated tothe cupboard behind the shoulder pads and perming rods. But in rejecting the flawednotion that ‘everything is the one thing,’ it need not follow that ‘nothing is the same asany other thing.’ Particularly thanks to advances in biology, morphology andconsciousness studies, there are some opportunities to compare modern experiencesto ancient in pursuit of a hypothesis, without suggesting that our ancestorsconceptualised the world in exactly the same way.The first two potential similarities are instructive on at least a personal level,and the latter two on a wider cultural one.Entheogenic ExperiencesHere in the opening act of the twenty first century, we are in a position to observewith a high degree of confidence that the human brain has remained almost entirelyunchanged for hundreds of millennia. We also have a large number of clinical studiesdocumenting the effects of psychoactive substances such as DMT and psilocybin onthe modern brain – and thus the modern mind. This provides us with a valuable vectorof enquiry in hypothesising about the minds of ancient men in cultures that we knowoverlapped with the presence of these substances in the local environment.Such data facilitate both positive and negative hypotheses. On the positive side,it allows us to ‘match’ physical and cultural artefacts to the images and visions seenby modern minds under the influence of psychoactive substances. Some of theseresults are particularly compelling. As Dr Sheldrake observes, there is no acceptablematerialist reason why a born and bred Londoner would experience jungle imagerysuch as panthers, pythons and dense greenery under the influence of ayahuasca takenin, say, Chiswick. Nevertheless, a high volume of urban, western experiencers reportsuch imagery and encounters. This suggests that either the imagery is somehowinherent in the molecule itself – which would still allow us to undertake comparativeanalysis – or, more likely, the molecule provides access to an independently existent,275"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"nonphysical reality – which would certainly allow us to undertake comparativeanalysis.On the negative side, we can also anthropologically observe the contemporaryuse of entheogens in cultures that have ‘declined’ away from its ritual use. As GastónGuzmán noted in his twentieth century ethnomycological study of Papua New Guinea,many of the tribes no longer use the locally-occurring psilocybin and boletusmushrooms in ceremonies. Much of this appears to be due to the impact ofdeforestation reducing encounter rates among the hunter-gatherer tribes. On the rareoccasions when these mushrooms are consumed, presumably accidentally, they canlead to violence and murder.Examining the contemporary experience of psychoactives in cultures that have‘fallen away’ from their ritual use is an essential counterpoint to the universalisttendency to sort of ‘spread’ the Mesoamerican experience of psilocybin into anyculture where the molecule is naturally occurring. That is a tactic straight out of theChoronzon School of Anthropology.Contemporary Magical ExperienceContentious, supremely personal and near-impossible to draw quantifiableconclusions from, the contemporary magical experience nevertheless seems alegitimate source of counter-checking for the wider hypothesis. It is not so much thecontent of contemporary magical experience – that overused phrase, ‘personal gnosis’– so much as it is its context. Recall, for instance, the experience of the reception ofThe Book of the Law from the previous chapter.Contemporary magical experience can be marshalled to countercheck thehypothesis not in terms of ‘the spirits told me this is what happened’ (for they areever-unreliable narrators) but in the wider synchronicitous context in which it occurs:what kind of ‘non-human logic’ was discerned in its aftereffects?A Modern ‘Contact Era’?We move toward ever more speculative means of counter-checking. If thehypothesis holds that increases in technological complexity are associated withincreasingly sophisticated astronomy and astrotheology, and that both are associatedwith an increase in what we still call UFO phenomena, then perhaps we need look nofurther than the twentieth century itself for a counter-check?Consider the fact that it was in this century, particularly in the decades after276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"World War II, that mankind achieved the greatest ever increases in technologicalcomplexity in our entire two million year history. While many of the UFO phenomenaobserved during this period – perhaps even most – were Cold War cover stories,these years could still be characterised as a flap of UFO flaps.What else were we doing during this era? Building precision space platformsthat physically took humans off the earth for the first time, installing telescopes in orbitand sending robots to planets named after ancient gods.Ancient NDEsMany readers will no doubt already be aware of my particular interest in theNear Death Experience. Since the installation of defibrillators in ambulances in the1960s, we have had a reliable way of bringing people back from the leading cause ofdeath in the world. Thus we have accrued a dataset that is vast in both number andimplications, often actual clinical conditions. There is simply no better source fromwhich to draw upon in determining which parts of the human consciousnessexperience: leaving the body, visiting geographically distant locations on earth, thecontinuity of one’s ancestors and the ‘shape’ of any potential afterlife.In his book, Conception of the Afterlife in Early Civilizations, Gregory Shushanadmirably attempts to map many of these experiences to mythological descriptions ofafterlife journeys, magical night flights, the achievement of immortality, and so on. Indoing so, he wades through some of the crudest academic dismissal of in-your-faceevidence seen this side of Egyptology.[T]he issue of universality is controversial in NDE studies, with someresearchers promoting cross-cultural difference at the expense of similarity. Forexample, in his assessment of perhaps the earliest western NDE account whichexplicitly claims to be factual (related by the Greek philosopher Clearchus ofSoli, C. 310 BCE), Bremmer ... states that the only similarity between theaccount and the modern NDE is a ‘feeling of drifting away.’ This, despite clearreferences to typical NDE elements such as OBE, meeting deceased relatives,moral evaluation assisted by mystical/divine beings, and clairvoyance. In astudy of Chinese NDEs, the researchers (Zhi-ying and Jian-xun 1992) seem tohave interpreted cultural/individual expressions of typical NDE elements asdissimilarities. Sensations of weightlessness and ‘feeling estranged from thebody,’ for example, must surely be equated with the OBE. ‘Unusually vividthoughts,’ a feeling that thought has sped up, a sense of peace and euphoria, anda life review are all standard NDE elements reported by their subjects. Murphy(2001) states that there is no being of light in Thai NDEs – despite reports of the277"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Buddha appearing as a star, and an encounter with ‘spiritual lights.’ (ibid.) Healso states that Thai NDErs do not report feelings of bliss, ecstasy, peace andthe like, but rather ‘pleasantness, comfort, a sense of beauty and happiness.’Rather than seeing these as analogous emotional states, he sees discontinuity.Encounters with deceased friends and relatives are similarly classified asdissimilarities because they do not specifically greet the NDEr, but ratherinstruct him/her. Murphy’s conclusion that ‘accounts of Western NDEs wouldseem to be useless in helping Thais know what to expect at their deaths’ is notsupported by Thai references to OBE, travelling in spiritual form to anotherrealm, life review with moral evaluation, encounters with divine/mysticalpresences, positive emotions, transcendent feelings and an impression ofknowing ‘all the truths of the universe,’ visions of the future, deceased relatives,and being instructed to return.Cross-cultural comparison is obviously not identical to cross-temporalcomparison, but hopefully we have demonstrated that not everything needs to be thesame thing for comparative examination to still have some use. Especially when youconsider the academics just described are pitching nothing but deliberatelymisinterpreted balderdash in support of a dominant, anti-comparative agenda.It seems likely that a comparative analysis can also provide insight into thepersonal esoteric experiences at the heart of the Laurasian storyline. For any initiatoryritual to ‘work,’ be it a Heb Sed or the installation of a new tribal chieftain or shaman, itmust necessarily be experienced as consciousness effects.Beginning with Vedic India, Shushan interprets the symbolism of thesolar/underworld journey. Each day, the sun emerges from the stone of Varuna, whichis equated with Yamaloka, the underrealm of the god of Death. Shushan writes:The deceased thus journeys with the sun through the netherworld on its way tothe dawn. This is done via sailing a boat on the primeval ocean. The soul is amicrocosm of the sun, an inner light hidden in the heart, just as the sun hidesunder the earth. Birds are symbolic of both the sun and this inner light. Thecelestial and subterranean worlds are associated with each other when thevisionary in the text equates the face of Agni (god of fire, light and the sun) withthat of Varuna; and with the father-son relationship of sun-god and netherworldgod. Elsewhere it is stated that Soma enables one to see the light of heaven andto find the sun.An underworld that is also the night sky, a boat journey on a primeval ocean, theheart as home of the soul that is also equated with the sun and solar birds. So far so278"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"‘Egyptian royal burial.’Let us now consider Gilgamesh. Although it appears that the Sumerian godsdenied mankind immortality, Shushan observes that the fact they installed Gilgameshas a divine judge suggests that it was physical immortality that was denied to us, asopposed to a posthumous continuity of existence. There are further elements to theGilgamesh story that not only map a hypothetical Laurasian esoteric experience, butalso the classic NDE experience.In seeking Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh travels along ‘the hidden road where the sunrises,’ around ‘mountains.’ Shushan notes that the word for mountain, kur, also meansNetherworld. Gilgamesh encounters the Scorpion People – likely asterisms – whoguard the sun’s gate at both horizons. This is very suggestive of the Vedic journey,especially when you factor in the boat journey across the underworld waters of Ea thathe must undertake to find Utnapishtim.In one of the earliest versions of his epic, Gilgamesh asks the sun god,Shamash, if the netherworld is a place of rest because he has been asleep ‘all theseyears.’ He continues by saying ‘but now let my eyes look on the sun so I am satedwith light. The darkness is hidden. How much light is there? When may a dead mansee the rays of the sun?’ Shushan cautions that these should not be consideredrhetorical questions. Gilgamesh, especially given his preoccupation with immortality,is clearly on a quest to achieve it. Shushan observes, ‘[t]hat he addresses thesequestions to the sun-god before entering the mountain further demonstrates that he isindeed embarking on a solar/underworld journey.’Again we have the sun journey/primeval ocean/stellar underworld componentwith an additional explicit reference to the face of the sun and its role in achievingimmortality – as in Vedic India and Egypt. There are further descriptions in theGilgamesh story that would be extremely familiar to someone who has had an NDE.As we have learned, Dilmun eventually lent its name to a trading partner of theSumerian/Babylonian cultures, but it was also the name of a ‘pristine’ land of peace,silence, abundant grain fields, clear fresh water and light; a realm where animals donot attack humans or steal their food, and where sickness and death is unknown. Thismay as well be a description of the Egyptian afterlife straight out of the New KingdomBooks of the Dead as a perfectly serviceable description of heaven from modern NDEencounters.Perhaps making the NDE association even more explicit, after entering themountain (netherworld), Gilgamesh outruns the sun and emerges into the ‘bright lightof a jewelled garden.’ The garden is the commonest setting for an NDE encounter with279"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"deceased relatives and wisdom teachers. It is here that Utnapishtim confers hismagical secrets to Gilgamesh, who is washed and given new clothes – a clearsymbol of his subsequent transformation. Gilgamesh finds his plant of immortality – aSoma analogue – but it is stolen by a snake, which is not only the earliest god of manavailable in the archaeological record, but also among the commonest visionsdescribed by those under the influence of entheogens (particularly DMT). There isthus a highly compelling match between the motifs associated with the more ‘esoteric’Laurasian storylines and contemporary experiences of both NDEs and entheogens.And so, inevitably, to Egypt.Emerging with the Middle Kingdom as part of the general democratisation of theafterlife, we have the classic ‘weighing of the heart in the court of Osiris’ motif, whichwould persist until the fall of Alexandria, thousands of years later. Shushan asks thequestion, what is this but a life review? The Egyptians delighted in their magicalcapacity to contact or visit the otherworld; their famous board game, Senet, is builtaround the shamanic capacity to visit the land of the dead and return. To be proficientin the game was to demonstrate your mastery over such a treacherous, albeitessential, journey.The same motifs of solar faces, night journeys with the sun through a stellarunderworld, boats, solar birds and the individual securing of immortality throughmagic that we see in the Old Kingdom rituals of the pyramids and Heb Sed festivalsrecur in the other ‘high Laurasian’ civilisations of Vedic India and Sumeria. It is to beexpected that, as Egypt picked up the pieces of the collapse of the Old Kingdom, manyof these experiences and motifs would recur in a more distributed fashion. Here isShushan’s summation of his mapping of the Egyptian afterlife experience with NDEs:[D]espite some uncertainties of language and meaning, it is clear that multipleyet unified experiences are being described. In addition to encounterswith/transformations into divine beings, the Egyptian afterlife includes leavingthe body in spiritual form and journeying to realms which are considered the‘home’ or origin state, an encounter with one’s own corpse leading to therealization of one’s spiritual immortality, entering darkness and emerging intolight via descent into and ascent from the Duat, water crossings and ferrymen,interrogations with a stress on the knowledge of the deceased, meeting one’sdeceased relatives, judgement or self-judgement based on one’s earthly moralconduct, a panoramic life review, obstacles/barriers and perils with the threat ofannihilation, and a cyclical existence of continual rebirth and renewal.Clearly there are some very specific corollaries between the ancient encounters280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"••••with the sacred and modern consciousness experiences. Any possibility of learningfrom or being inspired by not only our ancient but also our Palaeolithic ancestorsrelies on such an observation.FURTHER HISTORICAL SURVIVALSIn addition to discernable consciousness effects in the mythology of the ancientworld, the historical period also presents us with hundreds of anomalous encounters –some of which have shaped the course of empires – that suggest further continuities ofcontact, experience and ‘thermostat manipulation.’ Many of these are described inreligious terms but are clearly extradimensional encounters. These include theMiracle at Fatima and the story of the Virgin of Guadalupe, complete with its own lightshow in the sky and radiation effects on plant life. In fact the extradimensional Marystories are so numerous that Jacques Vallée refers to them in their own separatecategory as ‘the technology of the BVM.’Below are a few examples, drawn largely from Vallée and Chris Aubeck’shighly recommended Wonders in the Sky, that are representative of the range ofencounters we have every reason to suspect happened during the distant Palaeolithicera.Apulia, 216 BCE: During Rome’s largest defeat at the hands of Hannibal, ‘in thesky above Apulia, round objects in the shape of ships were seen. The prodigiescarried on all night long. On the edge of such objects were seen men dressed inwhite, like clergymen around a plough.’Constantinople, 438 CE: As the citizens were fleeing an earthquake that levelledmuch of the city, a child was suddenly lifted into the sky ‘by a strong force,’ sohigh that he vanished from the view of the people. Upon his slow return to earth,he told the emperor that he had ‘attended a great concert of the Angels hailing theLord in their sacred canticles.’Syburg, Germany, 776 CE: Saxons rebelling against Charlemagne witnessed‘two shields red with flame wheeling over the church.’ They were so frightenedthey fled the siege they had laid upon the castle and were defeated.Florence, 1347 CE: During an outbreak of the Plague, residents witnessed‘strange cigar-shaped objects slowly crossing the sky, sometimes at lowaltitude, dispersing in their passage a disturbing mist.’ Epidemics followed theirappearance.281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"•••••Milan, 1491 CE: Seven mysterious men dressed in togas and ‘wearing shiningshoes’ appeared one night in the study of the local philosopher and friend of DaVinci, Fazio Cardano. They confessed to being creatures of air who died just asmen did, although they could live for up to three centuries. When Cardano askedthem to show him treasures they said they were forbidden from doing so ‘by apeculiar law.’ They stayed with him for over three hours during which heinterrogated them about God and the universe, and there was no unity in theiranswers. One suggested that, contrary to the Bible, God created the universe‘moment to moment’ and that if he stopped, ‘the world would perish.’Bahamas, 1492 CE: From his ship, Christopher Columbus witnesses a light‘like the light of a wax candle moving up and down’ in the night sky. Althoughsome believed it to come from land, it was deemed too small. No land wassighted.Waldstadt, Germany, 1551 CE: A woman who got drunk and utteredblasphemies at a party was taken up into the air by the Devil ‘in the presence ofeveryone.’ She was lifted up and hovered over the edge of the village, as therevellers followed after her on the ground, whereupon she was dropped to herdeath with the whole town watching.Wiltshire, 1634 CE: A curate at a local school, while walking over the Downs,encountered a group of dancing elves in a fairy ring. He was paralysed on thespot and fell to the ground. The elves surrounded him and ‘pinch’d him all over,and made a sorte of quick humming noyse all the time.’ He awoke to findhimself in the centre of a freshly-pressed fairy ring in the grass.London, 1670 CE: From her teenage years, Jane Lead (née Ward) of Norfolkconfessed to hearing divine voices. In 1670 she described encountering a cloudwith a brilliant woman inside it, ‘her Face as the terrible Crystal for brightness,but her Countenance sweet and mild.’ She would go on to write about herrepeated abductions at the hands of beings who were neither devils nor angels.She called these abductions ‘Transports.’Clearly there are patterns worth exploring here, and it is only the ‘absence ofevidence’ challenge that restricts our interpretation of both our earliest availablemythologies as well as the implications of Palaeolithic architecture. We must movepast the binary of ‘physical evidence as described by materialist archaeologists’ andthe ‘anything goes’ world of personal spiritual gnosis. Much is to be gained from amore coherent analysis.282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"•••AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF CHILDRENGiven the persistence of ritual ‘shape’ down through the centuries, surprisinglyfew grimoire spirits are directly connectable on a nominal basis to the gods of theancient world. It seems to me there are a number of important reasons for this.I believe the impact of local mythology is underemphasised in the grimoires. Ifyou think about the gods and beasties of the classical world, they all had names.By the time we get to the Golden Legend, they are largely nameless. In at leastsome cases, I suspect local monster legends provided the names to would-betranscribers.Although there is a high degree of conservatism in the nomina magica, we arenevertheless dealing with spirit lists that were originally written downphonetically so as to ensure correct pronunciation, and then parsed throughmultiple languages, depending on their route into Europe: Greek, Latin, Arabic,German, Italian, Hebrew. They then bounce around internally for centuries.The sheer lack of textual evidence. Honestly, it cannot be overemphasised justhow few written texts pertaining to magic survived from the end of the ClassicalAge. If secondary titles for spirits, decans or asterisms were used, then itbecomes doubly difficult.Not that it matters much. As we have seen through the development ofGondwana motifs into the Laurasian storyline and then on into the historical period, itis the form or shape, rather than the title, which is conserved across language andtime. The purpose of this book is to suggest that some aspects of the western traditionthat have tumbled down to us along grimoire lines have evidently been tumbling for avery, very long time and not – perish the very thought – that the grimoire tradition hasits origins in the deepest Palaeolithic. Some of these magical motifs that can be tracedto the Classical World invite a practical reappraisal in light of their apparentlydramatically lengthened timescales. For me, it is comforting to ponder upon the factthat the crane, the peacock, the bull, the seven sisters, the serpent or dragon,Cerberus/Naberus and even the very Devil himself in the form of the Pan-GaeanTrickster have not only been our spirit companions since the fall of Alexandria, but formuch of – and in some cases the entire – human journey. It is doubly comforting tolook up and still see them in the sky, and know that the our distant ancestors weretelling bull stories about those very stars, or bear stories about those ones, or shipstories about that one.As with all aspects of western magic, the race to reconstruction is heartily283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"discouraged. In fact, if your takeaway from reading this far is an urgent need torecreate a Palaeolithic spirituality based on the implications of the partially excavatedsite of Göbekli Tepe, I will find you and personally knock this book out of your hands ona crowded train. Instead, recontextualisation of existing practices as they have arriveddown through the centuries to us is encouraged. I would even say mandatory.AstarothBecause I promised her I would, I am singling out Astaroth as the example ofmankind’s long-lived spirit companion par excellence. Have Jake Stratton-Kent catchyou up to speed. From The True Grimoire:The history of Astaroth in the Middle East and Egypt is long and complex. Itinvolves millennia of time, a vast swathe of geography and several languagegroups, besides a multiplicity of roles. Just one of her oldest forms, theSumerian Inanna, has been called the many-faceted goddess.[...][T]he lion is – as with other storm deities – a key attribute. She drives achariot drawn by lions, rides a lion, or is herself a lion.[..]Another key role of Inanna is as goddess of Venus as both the Morning andEvening Star ... As Evening Star ... she judges the just and the unjust. As theMorning Star represented productive work, so the Evening Star represented restand recreation, and another key role of Inanna follows from this; Inanna asharlot, goddess of music and dance, the protector of prostitutes and of alehouses. The Morning Star ... was also associated with her as goddess of war, asymbolism of surprisingly wide distribution among people of Asiatic descent.Inevitably, Jake is correct regarding the widespread distribution of theassociation between Venus as the Morning Star and goddess of war. And, as Dr Witzelteaches us, where we find widespread distribution we are likely looking at asignificantly earlier origin for the motif. This is to be expected given Inanna’sprominence in Sumerian mythology which, as discussed, sprung ‘fully-formed’ as aquintessential Laurasian storyline around 3,500 BCE, thus implying significantlyearlier antecedents.You will recall that Sarasvati was originally a river goddess, likely originatingbefore the end of the Ice Age given that her river – described in full flow in the oldestVedic texts – had long since dried up by the time they were apparently written down. Inthese same early texts, she is also a goddess of war and victory, then later addingpatroness of music and fine arts to her portfolio. Through her identification with the284"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"goddess Vac in Brahmanic texts, she is also addressed as a lioness and goddess ofvictory. Asko Parpola believes he has traced the etymology of vac to the Proto-Dravidic word meaning ‘voice, sound, song, war-cry, shout of excitement or joy,’which as a verb means to ‘roar (like a lion or a river), summon, make known orreveal’ (as in daybreak). The term is even a homonym for ‘daybreak,’ ‘lamp’ and‘Venus’; all concepts clearly associated with Inanna in her guise as goddess of victory.Parpola writes:Thus the lighted lamp (vilakku/vilakkam in Tamil and Malayalam) is a centralcultic symbol for the goddess of victory, who as Light annihilates the dark forcesof night and death. In Mesopotamia, the planet Venus, the brightest morning andevening star, is a symbol of Inanna-Ištar, the Goddess of War and Sex, and in theHindu tradition, Friday, connected with the planet Venus, is associated withwomen and the goddess.What this means is that if the Laurasian model holds, the being we have come toknow as Astaroth, currently enshrined on my humble little altar in west London,‘whose DNA,’ in the words of Peter Grey in Lucifer: Princeps, ‘luminesces in thevision of Revelation as the Whore of Babylon,’ was once summoned by the banks of along-dead, roaring glacial river to bring victory in battle over neighbouring Ice Agetribes.Approach with newfound caution and humility.The Headless RiteIn a compelling example of the sort of non-human logic described at the openingof this chapter, we have the Headless Rite. Straddling the modern and supremelyancient world, it is an invocation of an asterism that led tribes across the globe for tensof millennia, that had ‘headless’ star temples raised in honour of it and its consortwhere hunters would feast, take drugs and learn the skills of grain cultivation, thatbecame associated with stellar immortality (and still grain) to such an extent thatgreat stone maps of it were built upon the earth. In a transparently shamanic survival,alignment with this asterism conferred kingship over the realm of the spirits. So potentwas the initiatory power of headlessness – to have one’s head in another realm – thatit has survived into two of the three great religions of the Near East in the form of Johnthe Baptist, who ‘initiates’ Christ and thus brings that same promise of victory overdeath back down to earth.How or why could you possibly improve on that? There is no need to toddle offto Devon for a ‘shamanic initiation’ weekend. The blood spilled at Göbekli Tepe still285"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"stains the Headless Rite’s words of power.

David Bungal Mowaljarlai, Ngarinyin elderCANOPY OF STARSHow would you describe a hologram to a Neanderthal shaman? As ourunderstanding of space and the wider universe out beyond our gravity well – and ourexplorations of inner space – continue to deepen, it becomes clearer and clearer thatwe are playing in a bigger game than we had hitherto presumed.Has something tried to describe a hologram to a Neanderthal? What if theNeanderthal had asked perfectly reasonable questions like ‘what is this place?’ or‘what is it made of?’ or ‘how does it work?’ How would such answers be reflected inthe culture that asked them? Let us not pretend for a moment that these questions didnot pass through the minds of early humans. Mircea Eliade believed that all creationmyths were an attempt to explain how consciousness, how self-awareness, firstarose. Interesting then, in the context of just who would be answering, that Dr Witzel’sresearch suggests it is the Trickster, at a time depth of more than 70,000 years, who isour first culture hero and civilising god, and that providing us with answers may haveviolated some sort of cosmic taboo.I believe Dr Witzel is probably correct in his findings that the Trickster sits atthe very bottom of our global tree of gods. ‘Trickster’ is the best mythic description ofthe capricious, unreliable, sometimes truthful, sometimes deliberately manipulativenature of whatever the UFO/extradimensional/spirit phenomenon actually is. Weappear to be dealing with – and have been dealing with for a very long time – a rangeof phenomena with at least one subset interested in ‘teaching’ us or otherwisetransmitting knowledge in an oblique fashion. This knowledge appears designed toimpress us with its slight superiority and ‘inspire’ us in specific directions. Considerhow its presentation has changed over the millennia, from therianthropic gods todemons to angels to flying chariots to elves and fairies to the Virgin Mary to airships toflying saucers to cigar-shaped craft to flying triangles. In 1997, what are now known asthe Phoenix Lights were witnessed by thousands of modern Americans, including airforce pilots who were scrambled to intercept the phenomenon. It was described as agiant, silent, triangular craft with a wingspan the size of several football fields. Would afamily group living on the plains of Southern Africa 70,000 years ago have the cultural287"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"context to interpret that phenomenon? Would they even be able to see it?Since leaving Africa, the human story appears to be one of colonising andexploring a physical world that is deeply and intrinsically interrelated with at least oneother higher or extradimensional realm. From the scant but nevertheless compellingevidence of the ritual activity of other hominins, particularly Neanderthals, we werenot alone in attracting the interest or attention of this other realm. Each year, more andmore archaeological and genetic evidence paints a picture of a Palaeolithic world richin culture, nuance and star lore. It must be remembered that the vast majority ofhuman existence was lived in this state – in a hunter-gatherer world, free of lightpollution and populated with near-genetic neighbours (and at least one hobbit) that weoccasionally interbred with. Perhaps we have fallen away from this state ofawareness? Perhaps ‘they’ have fallen away from us?Just how far one wishes to follow this line of reasoning is entirely personal.Famously, Princeton psychology professor Julian Jaynes suggested in the 1970s that,prior to 1250 BC, the entire human race literally heard voices in their head which theyconsidered to be from their gods, spirits and ancestors. It is really more of a thoughtexperiment than an actual theory owing to its complete unfalsifiability, but it isinstructive nonetheless. Firstly, most textual sources state explicitly that the godsspoke to Gilgamesh or Achilles or Ramses, and Jaynes used the more recentexample of Joan of Arc by way of comparison.The hearing of literal voices was Jaynes’s frankly quite reasonable explanationfor some bizarre burial practices, including live internment of servants and theprovision of loaves of bread: ‘This practice has no clear explanation except that theirvoices were still being heard and perhaps demanding such accommodation.’ Moreinterestingly, he – correctly, to my mind – dismissed the fertility explanation for theexplosion of figurines and life-size images in the closing years of the Neolithic giventhat fertility did not appear to be a problem among the people who fashioned them.Instead he suggested that these figures actually spoke and were heard by thetribespeople. (It certainly throws Old Kingdom royal cults into new light.) Precedentfor such behaviour includes the biblical description of the King of Babylon ‘consultingwith images’ or the Aztecs’ story to the Spanish that their civilisation began when astatue in an ancient, ruined temple began instructing their leaders.Inevitably for a psychological theory that is almost forty years old, it relies onsome wildly outdated speculation regarding brain function and falls into the moderntrap of assuming our ancestors were dumb or savage. The point, nevertheless, is wellmade: if we consider Jaynes’s theory to be ‘100% spirit contact’ and the contemporary288"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"western world to be around ‘6% spirit contact,’ there is simply no way to know quitehow literally these consciousness effects were experienced, or where the people ofthe Palaeolithic fell on the ‘spirit scale.’COMPLEXITY OF RECEIVED INFORMATIONAnother reason why Jaynes’s theory is not well-loved in magical circles is theimplications that the voices heard in one’s head were ‘made up’ rather than issuingfrom some external source of agency. This, at least, is a testable hypothesis, and theevidence points, in some instances, to transmission from external sources. If you donot like this idea, you can simply expand the concept of consciousness to theunconscious to the collective unconscious and achieve the same result.Returning to the Dogon, the notion that they ‘tricked’ their French anthropologistswith their knowledge of the invisible-to-the-naked-eye Sirius B, or that theanthropologists made it up, is nonsense. The tribe also managed to describe itselliptical orbit, the fact that it was significantly smaller than Sirius A, but that it weighedmuch, much, more and also the presence of a third star, Sirius C, which wasconfirmed by astronomers in 1995. According to Laird Scranton, their Nommoiconography also shows a surprisingly sophisticated understanding of the operation ofchromosomes inside a cell. It is indeed unlikely that physical extraterrestrials wouldland in West Africa, pointlessly explain some information about the mass of theirhome star system, impart some information about biology the Dogon couldn’t possiblyuse and then fly back home.A psychic contact scenario is a better match for the presence of redundantcomplexity in the Dogon stories of Sirius. Any magician worth her salt hasexperienced the phenomenon of receiving more information than required from thespirit world. It is interesting, yes. But ultimately pointless.This same mechanism of action provides more parsimonious explanations forany number of anomalous data points, such as the famous Piri Reis map. Whilst themap does appear to show a superficial resemblance to the coastline of Antarcticawithout ice, which do you think is more likely: an accurate description of a coastlinesurviving down more than a million years or some sort of early navigational variant ofremote viewing? (You don’t think the best ancient navigators were clairvoyant? I put itto you that someone either saw or was shown that coastline.) Further examples,relevant to some of the areas covered in this book, appear to bear out the ‘redundantcomplexity as evidence of contact with an external agency’ scenario.Nabta Playa289"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"•••The pastoral tribes of Neolithic East Africa are not currently known to have beenan intergalactic people. When Thomas Brophy – who, I remind you, is an actual rocketscientist – was examining the outlying stones around the calendar circle, he noted thattheir distance from the circle scale to represent the actual distance of the stars awayfrom earth. Even more impressively, those aligned to Vega – used as a marker star tocorroborate the various alignments – scale to represent the radial velocity of the starsthey represent.Brophy notes, in regards to the carved bedrock underneath the calendar circle,which had the cow stone buried between it and the surface, ‘[a]stonishing as it may be,the bedrock sculpture underneath Complex Structure A’ at Nabta Playa appears to bean accurate depiction of our Milky Way galaxy, as it was oriented astronomically at aspecific time: vernal equinox heliacal rising of the Galactic Center in 17,700 BC.’ Thecow stone itself was located above the location of our sun on the ‘galaxy map’ beneathit.The Nabta Playa results are probably the most interesting on a personal level asthey strike me as the best match for an hypothesised Laurasian ‘stellar immortalitytechnology’ or a sort of ‘stone age hermetics.’ Not only was Complex Structure A aground map of Orion, calibrated to both Sirius and the Imperishable Stars, itdemonstrates a scaling of the ‘as above, so below’ concept to a genuinely galacticlevel that is simply quite beyond the skills of Neolithic cowherds. One wonders whogave them the idea.The VedasAs with Nabta Playa, we have explored some of the Vedic mathematics that,while hugely impressive, are not quite beyond the astronomical skills of the peoplewho sung them. There are other elements which suggest someone was on the otherend of the line, so to speak:Not only do the Vedas state that the sun does not move, it is also described as anordinary star ‘in the daytime.’The Vedas demonstrate an awareness that not all the stars are the samedistance from earth.The Vishnu Purana describes earth’s tidal action: ‘in all the oceans the waterremains at all times the same in quantity and never increases or diminishes; butlike the water in a cauldron, which in consequence of its combination with heat,expands, so the waters of the ocean swell with the increase of the moon. The290"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"•waters, although really neither more nor less, dilate or contract as the moonincreases or wanes in the light and dark fortnights.’Both the Rig Veda and the Yajur Veda describe sun spots.THE NUIT FORMULAWhy Nuit? Yes, she appears on the Stele of Revealing so Crowley shouldprobably have expected her to show up, but as answers go it still seems faintlyunsatisfying. Nuit is an odd goddess. She has very few temples but is commonlydepicted in others, particularly those of her children, Osiris and Isis. She is alsoregularly depicted inside coffins and tombs. With the rise of Horus she becomes, notthe mother of the gods, but the grandmother of the gods – a further step removed fromagency in the day-to-day lives of Egyptians, but, like a true grandmother, still,affectionately ‘there.’In many ways she is only half goddess and half ‘cosmic formula.’ She is aperhaps a step too far ‘up’ the cosmological description of the universe to be quite asapproachable to humans as are her children. Nuit is the personification of the entireunderworld that is also the night sky, a place we must pass through to becomeimmortal. She – as the sum total of all the stars – is our origin and our home. Nuit isthe last vestiges of the cosmos’s personality before it dissolves into a benign,undifferentiated pantheism. Mankind’s emergence into full consciousness is intimatelyrelated to the stars, and recognising and reactivating that awareness is what the stellargoddess represents. When you speak of her you are speaking of the entire range ofcosmic and spirit phenomena.Nuit is how you explain a hologram to a Neanderthal.WHO OWNS THESE STORIES?How outrageous of me to get so far into a book of this nature without checkingmy privilege. To speak of New Guineans without having brown skin, to speak ofbiology without having a diploma and just simply to speak about more than one thing.Surely the world has seen enough universalisms issuing from London to last the restof the Kali Yuga?Well, comparison is not the same thing as universalism. Indeed, WendyDoniger says that ‘eclecticism is essential to the comparatist’s methodology.’ When itcomes to magic, I would go even further. Magicians are not simply opportunisticcomparativists, magicians are thieves.
